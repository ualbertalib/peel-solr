 few days after about two days travel we camped in the llund hills 3 on top of the highest hill
 in ight and one which had a plentiful supply of limber on the north side of it from our point
 of vantage we could see for miles and in fact before our lodge was set up a buffalo appeared graz
 ing near two buttes similar to the one we were on with timber on the north side of them and
 not more than threequarters of a mile away so i took my i ‘ rifle and started off to try
 and get him ‘ upon getting to the first butte i was quite c disappointed as i could not see
 the buf falo i walked round the first clump of timber possibly an acre then went on to the second
 hill while standing there i heard a crackling in the timber i had just left and turned around in time
 to see my donald graham had this photo taken in owen buffalo coming out on the run as he sound
 ont in 1870 two years before his was heading in my direction i dropped expedition through alberta out of sight
 until he got into the depression between the two hills i then ran to when starting for the plains south
 of the brow of the hill and got behind a fort edmonton i left my cart behind me clump of
 brush in a few minutes he came and brought a flat sleigh which was cantering up and passed on the
 run withvery much like a large tobaggan and in just a few steps of where i knelt i which slipped
 easily over the top of the shot him as he passed by he ran to the snow i also brought
 what i considered brow of the hill pitched forward on his was plenty of provisions including flour breast and rolled
 to the bottom plenty of tea pemmican dried buffalo it was my first buffalo and i was meat etc all
 of which could be bought greatly elated he looked as big as from the hudson s bay company also an
 elephant to me as he passed by buffalo fat or tallow and marrow fat my friends were pleased also we
 these last mentioned were always put dressed him that evening taking the up in bladders extended to about eight best
 of the meat to camp with us and inches in diameter the marrow fat was fcp ierson a well i
 flown pioneer really quite a superior article being who operated a post near carstairs before the somewhat granular with a
 decided yel arrival of the n w m p he later became a low tinge and not so hard as
 the other freighter betiveen calgary and edmonton and was one of the largest operators along the trail however i had
 not taken into consideration the half breed custom of starting 2 in a letter graham slates that dutch charley was
 of norwegian descent out witn oniy a iew aays provisions on 3 the hand hills are beamed south east of
 hanna hand depending entirely upon what they 4 was i proud he recalled in another account could kill for their
 support todd s pro that was hardly ilie name for it i was fairly visions soon gave out and as
 a matter dancing to think i had really shot a buffalo i did shoot many after that but none that
 ever om course mine degan to go tne same way gale inc the thrill that i got from shooting this
 small game of various kinds helped out one the balance i put strychnine in for the the future to he
 within a reasonable dis benefit of the wolves he was in very tance of camp at nightfall good shape for
 a bull out alone as ani we could see every sign of a blizzard mells of this description are generally
 coming so we hurriedly moved our lodge in poor condition being usually old and to the foot of the bill
 on the north side weak being driven out of the herd by where we not only had the advantage of
 the younger and more vigorous bulls shelter but carried our wood downhill the weather was fine and clear hut instead
 of up there we passed christbitterly cold with always more or less mae of 1872 and one of our tidbits
 was a wind which kept the tops of the hills chunk of wolf fat each 5 thanks to my swept
 clear of snow so that our horses strychnine bait i had got three large grey had plenty of feed without
 having to paw wolves they were very fat and it was for it the following day as we could the
 regular thing to render out the back see no buffalo in sight ad csnd i deter fat and eat it
 as a relish with our leaner mined to hunt as far south as possible buffalo meat i think that in
 cold counand be back by night we shot one buf tries where the diet is practically all kilo on our
 way but found that he was meat the human system requires a good too old and thin to be of
 any use we deal of fat personally i used to detest it hut on occasions i could take a large
 kept on until fairly late when seven bufkilo came feeding over a hill as it was chunk of wolf fat
 and not only eat it but all open country we could not approach enjoy it them and so we lay
 still hoping they the blizzard developed all right with might disappear in some hollow and thus blinding intensity but we
 were snug and give us a chance as they did not do so comfortable in the shelter we had picked
 and it was getting late we decided to we heard afterwards that seven or eight try a long shot at
 them of course we indian lodges camped some distance to hcid to take off our mittens to shoot and the
 south of us had their lodges blown in the short time it took ad to fire two or down and
 they just simply had to lie three times with his winchester his fing where they were for two cl three
 days ers were frost bitten the winter before until the storm abated he caine near to losing a foot by
 frost between christmas and new year s bite and was in consequence very ncr four young indians bloods came to
 our vous he grew highly excited when he lodge they were on foot and told us noticed his hand and
 exclaimed oh they had no food and were hungry so we donald what will i do to save my hand
 gave them a piece of the buffalo i had i took a handful of snow rubbed his killed lingers vigorously
 for a while took his fortunately for me i had determined gun and told him to slap his hands about
 to go back and join todd again and for a time and they would be all right bring sonic of
 the buffalo meat along this proved to be the case and shortly vrith me so i left ad and dutch
 charwe were on our way again icy camped that night in a point of we had delayed too long as
 it was timber and the following day rejoined and darkness came down quickly on us todd while i had been
 gone an indian so we feared it might be difficult to locate and his squaw had camped alongside of the
 lodge i could see what looked like todd and his wife i do not know whether o bri ght light
 ahead of us and remarked they were relatives or not but they wore that chancy had left the lodge cover
 certainly very friendly with us as long open so that the light would guide us as i remained there a
 day or so later imagine our consternation when we dis ad and charley came along with a covered that we
 were heading for a bright star just coming up over the hill 5 amid we did hare such a merry
 christmas din fortunately for us when we were nearly ncr he recalled in a letter we cooked the past our
 camp charley came out to get buffalo roast and ale it with hammocks made of f our and water amid
 hal ed over hot stonessome wood and we caught the flash of a feast fit for a king after our
 dinner we the camp fire as he threw back the flap gathered around the camp fire and dutch if he
 had not done so it is hard to say charley told mis stories of christmas das and what might have
 happened as it was cuslouns in aorwau when he was a boy the virginian mcpherson told us how they cele
 full y thirty miles to timber in the direc brated christ umas in virginia while i told of tio we
 were heading i was careful in christmas days in anid scotland single horse hauling their effects on the their dogs
 it might prove to be an unway back to edmonton it seems that healthy quarter for me our friendly indians
 to whom we had after a few days we heard of a camp given the buffalo meat were out on
 a of half breeds who had been south of the horse stealing expedition and had stolen red deer river and
 were returning with three of their horses and would have a plentiful supply of buffalo moat as i made away
 with the fourth one also cx camp and i traded some of it for a quarcept for the fact that
 it happened to he ten of meat near camp they followed the indians had some lea left we rode over
 to their for some distance in an effort to recover a day or two later todd and the indian the
 stolen animals but were unable to determined to go on a buffalo hunt i of catch up course accompanying them
 they asked i found out afterwards that t was that we should leave all of the meat with always well
 to watch your aninmials the two women as we were sure of getclosely if a few bucks came along ing
 buffalo further south to this i conas they did in this case it was al sented and the following morning
 after most certain that they were out on a a somewhat scanty breakfast we started horse stealing expediikn they al
 on what proved to be the hardest and ways travelled light with iust their most miserable trip i ever took
 it was guns and hair lariat hidden under bitterly cold snowing and drifting with their blankets the wind in our
 faces the indian took it was a week or ten days before i the loud riding a buffalo horse of
 todd s moved south with todd and his wife the we followed with the flat sleighs with a friendly indian
 and his squaw headed lodge and all the firewood we could for the camping grounds where i had carry how
 the indian ever contrived to weathered out the blizzard with ad and keep his course i am unable to say
 be chancy my object in this case was the cause between snow and drift no landhope of finding some more
 dead wolves marks could be seen in fact at times we by the bait on visiting it however could hardly
 see the person ahead of us there was not a scrap of dead buffalo to we kept on until nightfall
 when we be seen instead there were two dead camped in a somewhat sheltered hollow indian dogs and the ashes
 of a number of pitched our lodge and made ourselves as campfires evidently a camp of starving comfortable as possible
 making a small indians had been there and they had fire to help out a bit we had nothing used
 up what meat was left i was told to eat which did not help to make matthat the strychnine could
 be boiled out tens any pleasanter i think todd felt of the meat but nevertheless i was pretty the intense
 cold as much as i did it was anxious for a few days as i thought if a case of
 either one of us hugging the any indians had gone the same way as little fire off and on all
 inght what sur il t ‘ a 4 r i •• ‘ ‘ s we this is the type of
 ox cart used by metis and early travellers la alberta it was superior to the bull train and wagon in
 the bush because ii was lighter and would not bog down la the mud pnsed me was to see the
 indian strip off they were apparently discussing my such clothing as he had on wrap himself utter useless as a
 provider they put up in his buffalo robe and sleep like a top their hands up to their mouths and
 made all night even the horses felt the cold a peculiar clucking sound in their as they caine up amid
 stood in the lee of throats would finish up with moonias the lodge for shelter the only night i which
 is simply cree for greenhorn knew them to do so this they did two or three times and i next
 morning with nothing to cook we must say that i never saw contempt more were soon off we left the
 lodge stand plainly expressed in the eyes of anyone iiig where it was the indian took the as in the
 eyes of those indians as though locud riding todd s buffalo runner we to say we have no meat in
 the lodgefollowed with the sleighs to take back the idea of a grown man passing by a fat the meat
 it was afternoon before we porcupine and letting a little indian boy sighted buffalo the indian had a long get
 it i kept a sharp lookout after that hard run before he killed one it takes a hoping to redeem
 myself in their eyes i good running horse to catch up with a soon got one but doubt if it
 helped any young cow the indian and todd made and as a matter of fact i came to the a
 satisfactory meal on the raw meat hut conclusion that if i had to be a partaker hungry amid all as
 i was i could not eat in the feast i did not want redemption any in our move southwards we
 got into we soon had the animal cut up loaded the vicinity of a sarcee camp and as i on
 the sleighs amid struck back for camp expressed a wish to go into their camp i would hesitate to say
 how much meat and see them at home a young halfwe ate that night we had a number of breed
 agreed to go with me he warned pieces on sticks roasting before the fire me however that i must go
 with a blan when cooked to our liking it soon disap ket around me indian fashion it seemed peared another
 piece taking its place that the sarcees depended entirely on this was kept up for an hour or more dogs
 for transportation large savage as the weather had moderated a good huskies part wolf and part dog and as deal
 we passed a fairly comfortable they might attack a white man it might night made an early slant the next
 morn go hand with him ing and got hack to the lodges about going into their camp somewhat norsundown we
 had used up all the pro vously i must say on account of the warnvisions i had brought from edmonton
 ing about the dogs i suddenly felt a and for some time we had depended en sharp nip on the
 calf of my leg feeling timely on what we could kill in conse sure it was a dog i jumped
 around quickquence it was always either a feast or a ly there to my astonishment was a famine and from
 what i could make out little boy evidently greatly delighted nearly all the half breeds and indians with himself squatted
 on his haunches wore in the same position there was grinning all over and thumb up to his plenty of
 buffalo south of the red deer nose in the most approved fashion i riven but the half breeds and crees
 did might deceive the dogs with the blanket not seem to be at all anxious to go south evidently but
 not the boy into the blood and blackfoot country un we were received very cordially in til a good force
 of them had gathered and the chief s lodge and it was both the were moving south all of them
 on pretty largest and most comfortable lodge i had short commons we camped one night seen the squaws had a
 large pot boilalongside of a pretty deep coulee which ing on the fire with buffalo meat blood sometimes run across
 the country for and i don t know what else in it and miles and in the present case had
 plenty after we had shaken hands with every of limber in it so i went down to bring brave in
 the lodge the squaws came up firewood i saw a big porcupine but and handed each of us a cup
 just then as i considered it to be useless i passed it one indian who i suppose had been by
 a little indian boy came along and missed in the general hand shaking cit once attacked it as he was
 too small came and held out his hand thinking to kill it i killed it for him i then got
 he wanted the cup i held it out to him my wood and went back to camp ap with a
 look of disgust plainly evident parently the porcupine incident had got on his face he turned around and sat there
 ahead of me the indian squaw down again seeing my mistake jumpwas in the lodge with todd s wife and
 ed up at once and went and shook hands with him which apparently made it all her of others doing
 the same sure right our cups were then filled from enough when the riders attacked the the pot and i
 enjoyed it very much cii herd they caine in our direction three though i dare say if i hod enquired
 too or four hundred of them closely bunched clcsely into its composition i might not and going at a tremendous
 pace they have liked it as well passed within about seventy yards of us speaking of indians showing offence i
 was successful in dropping a fine young i recall an incident that happened to an cow with a shot from
 my rifle as they old neighbor of mine who had been a went by however we did not have as
 member of the quebec battalion seeing much meat as one might imagine the the indian steersman of the boat he
 was rule on the plains being that all who in enjoying the pipe my friend asked him assisted at the
 dressing of an animal for a smoke the pipe was passed with were entitled to a share of the meat
 this out a word my friend after very care was a faithfully observed custom and fully wiping the mouthpiece proceeded
 several of the unsuccessful ones assisted to smoke apparently the wiping pro us i remember some time later when cess
 must have offended the steersman todd and i were unsuccessful we assistfor on the pipe being passed back he ed
 at an indian kill our help was conlooked my friend straight in the eye deliberately broke the mouthpiece off threw
 the piece away and put the pipe hack in his pocket without a word the indians and half breeds w
 e r e always s c o u t i n g around looking for buffalo one of them ‘
 mh r ‘ ‘ dially received almost as if we were benefactors and we were sent away with a generous
 supply of meat we then moved down to the red deer river where buffalo and other game was plentiful so
 that it was a continual feast still small game was not despised one of the half breeds found a couple
 of beaver dams and i learned something about digging out beaver he proceeded to cut holes in the ice opposite
 the entrance to the houses went away for a few hours and came back with a number of sharpened stakes
 when he was fairly sure that the beaver were in their dens repor ted several hundred of them were feeding
 a day s march to the east so camp was struck at once and moved that way about nightfall one
 of the breeds wounded a buffalo he said it could not possibly live more than two or three hours so
 the next morning as it had run in the direction we were going we followed its tracks and came on
 the dead animal a little before noon all hands being short of provisions camp was made at once and meat
 cooking became general the buffalo could not have been dead more than twelve or he drove stakes quickly into the
 mud thus blocking up the entrance and making prisoners of the beaver he invited todd and me to assist in
 digging them out promising that we would get a share in the meat which the indians looked upon as a
 great delicacy the first house was a small one and though frozen hand we dug it out quickly and got
 one beaver the next one was quite large and yielded two beaver but we certainly earned them as we were
 chopping the frozen ground for the best part of the day before we got them i found that amongst these
 people everything that walked and fourteen hours but decomposition sets in very quickly when the entrails are not removed one
 could actually pull the uncooked meat of this animal to pieces with the fingers and the taint was quite strong
 but i heard no complaints after about an hour we moved on as we were not far from where the
 buffalo had been seen upon locating them a conference was held at which it was decided that those who had
 good running horses should make a wide detour run and come on the buffalo from the opposite side so that
 when they started to run they might head towards camp and give as many as possible a chance for a
 shot i took the direction which we thought the buffalo would take when started a numsome things that didn t
 were eatable big or little inside and out nothing was wasted i had tried most of it but i was
 a good deal like the yankee who could eat crow and said i kin eat crow but i don t
 hanker arter it it was now early in march of 1873 and quite a large party of breeds amid indians
 had gathered together south of the red deer river intending to visit one of the nearest trading posts south on
 bow river at that time the only white men between this is a p arm of jima i and jiunmilton
 s post on the bow river is sketched by tfr graham during his visit in 1873 lie noted 1 mat
 luring his visit the store roo mi contained 2 000 buffalo rolmes time north side of the fort has a
 yard protected by a pollisade of 10 foot poplar poles through the roof with winchester rifles whenever footsteps were heard
 above which proved effective the garrison consisted of six men which included the manager and interpreter the interpreter was a
 negro i was told that the negroes master the indian language more quickly and easily than the white man of
 course liquor was the greatest trading article at the post this as made up consisted of ten gallons of alcohol
 to a forty gallon barrel filled with water and colored with burnt sugar 8 6 jo mn j holy amid

 between the pal nodes he also commmmented that in 1871 one of the traders had frozen to death in the

 building at all although a fain sized one amid built strongly of logs surrounded by a balustrade it was an
 outpost of healy and hamilton s g managed by a mr davis 7 and my experience of him was that
 he was a very kindly hospitable man i told him that i did not intend to return to edmonton but
 was going to continue on to fort benton montana he however advised me strongly against going on alone the indians
 met would be bloods and blackfeet he said and as they might be the worse of liquor it would be
 very dangerous to say the least he then cordially invited me to slay at the post until their wagons came
 along for the furs i accepted his very jind offer which gave me a good cpportunity of becoming acquainted with
 conditions generally the post consisted of three rooms general living room and cooking room store room and trading room along
 the front of the latter was a passage way about seven or eight feet wide into this the indians came
 to do their trading it was connected with the trading room by a trap door which could be let down
 quickly in an emergency i was told that on no condition must indians be allowed inside i suggested that in
 case they determined to get in the roof did not seem to offer any great obstacle to them they just
 laughed and said that way had been tried once or twice but the defenders lit the candles for them and
 it was never tried now lighting the candles for them it seemed consisted in shooting the rod deer and the
 boundary line were 40 ainericcmn whiskey traders and wolfers it may not be amiss to mention i that for the
 whole dstance to the kitcl cn days travel i never saw cattle store bow river a little better than two

 thousands of them we travelled in an open space not much more than half a mile across the buffalo opened
 out in front of us as we passed and closed up behind us after crossing the bow river amid when
 within about two miles of the trading yard post the party halted and proceeded to spruce up a bit according
 to their individual notions the indians all produced red and blue paint with which they painted their faces on arriving
 at the one day a minor chief of the bloods gratitude for the treatment received as came into trade lie
 had quite a retinue he sent mr davis a present of a fine with him and i watched the proceodimigs
 horse after he left with a good deal of interest they were one more instance of the effect of the
 not at all hurried in their trading ap whiskey trade on the indians a blood purently there was no trouble

 thought they wanted would have a bit of fun at the old chief s generally however a small keg and
 expense so one said old maycasto is buffalo robe was passed in into the keg too drunk now to help
 himself and he has a half gallon of liquor was poured which been pretty mean to us sometimes we was

 at between fifty and sixty they made a laughing move towards dollars for each gallon of alcohol i him but
 the chief drew his revolver and counted purticularly and keg and huf in less time than it takes to tell
 there lab robe were passed in eighteen differ were two dead indians and several more ent times this was a
 very fair sample woundedui of the trading usually done the indians through the liquor trade these southwere not encouraged to

 it there must have amid a movement of his hamid towards his been the carcasses of between forty and bolt
 fifty wolves and all skinned amid on less don t you try to mix up in this it 15 than
 an acre of ground my companion mione of your d d business he said assured me that the wolves which
 lie had so i wisely concluded to leave and seen were all within a radius of a couple went out
 there seemed to be a different of miles or so from this i gathered that feeling amongst a good many
 of those after the trouble with the indians the men to anythimig which i had been used wolfers had hurriedly
 skinned the wolves to the only other white inhabitants in the immediate vicinity of the baits and were wolfers for
 miles around those then left men like the liquor traders outfitted at the following morning we started skin benton and
 came north well prepared for ning wolves were scattered here and the business in which they were engag there seldom
 more than a mile from the ed the outfit included horses wagons bait toward noon while i was skinning running
 horses winchester rifles and a a wolf the dutchman passed me seemgoodly supply of strychnine they gen ingly in a
 hurry when i had finished i orally worked in couples although they followed and soon found the reason for might
 sometimes have an extra man or the haste just as i came over the hill i two along to do
 camp work and skin saw my companion busily gathering wolves they operated some distance wolves together he must have had
 apart each outfit killed twenty five or seven or eight of them piled up there thirty buffalo for bait and
 these animals was another wolf some distance away were well opened up and two bottles of and he started on
 the run to get that strychnine one eighth ounce each put one also without ever looking in my into every
 carcass that bait would be direction i at once knew that his acscattered over a district possibly two lions meant
 that our agreement was at townships or more in extent in some an end i node down quickly to the
 pile cases more than one hundred wolves dismounted laid my rifle alongside me have been pcisoned around a single bait
 and began making motions as if i was and as these skins were worth from 2 50 skinning he was
 bent over by this time to 3 olf each at benton it was quite a dragging the other wolf along
 but happrofitable and attractive business for ad pening to look up he saw me and began venturous spirits it was
 not however yelling at the top of his voice that those without a spice of danger one outfit were his
 wolves i yelled back that s operating to the northeast of where cab played out dutchman i found this gary
 now stands had been attacked by bunch he came running towards me indians one of their number killed and and
 when within about sixty yards drew the others driven away leaving a large his revolver i had hardly anticipated number
 of wolves unskinned that but i picked up my rifle quickly one day a german known as the big cocked
 it and had it levelled across my headed dutchman came to the post his ‘ nee when he came up
 i did not want wife a squaw and several children to hurt him if i could get out of it
 but i along with him he said that he had was not going to be shot up if i knew
 been over the district where these wolf anything about it he came up to within ers had been and that
 he knew of be about thirty yards of me stood for a tween forty and fifty wolves lying there minute
 and then quietly slipped his reunskinned he did not like to risk going volver back into his pocket after them
 alone but if anyone went with him he would go after some conversa lion i agreed to go along with
 him on the understanding that we were to work separately and that we should both skin ‘ wolves as long
 as there were any in ‘ si ght i was told at the post that my f companion had a
 rather unsavoury re ‘ ‘ putation but i decided to take a chance ‘ f we started the following morning
 with i gmtliered these wolves together he up i decided to accompany them both said there are four niore just
 over the were americans one a white man and hill you can go and skin them the oilier a half
 breed named starr he all right i answered but this is generally acted as interpreter for some of the traders
 our trail to the south led not according to our understanding directly through what is now the town of however
 since you are so mean about it you can have this bunch whether the high river hi after passing that
 point we turned to the east heading straight for cthers are there on not whoop up we were passing through
 a ii e had evidently looked around fairly dry country and were sometimes short closely when he had passed through
 be of water on one such occasion starr fore bc cause i found the four wolves as went out amid
 killed a buffalo calf only he stated i had them skinned and start a few days old he opened it
 up and ed back before lie was through i had took out the stomach which was found been thinking the
 matter over in the to contain nearly a gallon of clear lookmeant ime and although i did not con ing
 milk amid of this both my companions sider myself to blame i felt very much drank heartily as they seemed
 to enjoy ashamed at the idea of going back to the it i partook also my greatest objection post amid
 telling them of our quarrel it being the container this i spread out as was a case of two men
 all alone in a much as possible so as not to touch my place where to say the least we
 would cheeks the milk itself was just plain be in extreme danger should the indians curdled milk amid to thirsty
 men it was come along on the same quest so i rode quite palatable what struck me as back to
 the dutchman and said in as strange was that although i had read friendly a manner as possible well dozens
 of western stories i had never have you got over being angry yet he seen such an incident mentioned i
 looked at me as savagely as one of the found that a young buffalo calf never beasts which he was
 skinning might runs away very far when one chased the have done so i said i see you have mother
 they would lie down flat in the not and rode on feeling as if i were in a grass and
 when one rode up to them stramige country and as a matter of fact they would jump up and run

 orderly country consisting of cree mother had come back i had to get off indians half breeds the hudson bay

 its wits the red deer river bloods blackfeet the calf followed me right into camp whiskey traders wolfers and american
 we arrived at whoop up without any western influence chaos in fact other incident worth recording this was the headquarters
 of healy and hamilton we kept apart after that both skinning it was quite a pretentious post situated industriously until
 near night i then went back to our camp determined that at the junction of the belly and st mary
 rivers from whoop up i later made my if at all possible we would not go back to the post
 as open enemies at any rate way over to fort benton across to oreqcn and up into british columbia where
 the dutchman was there when i got in i made my home and somewhat reluctantly met my advances he thawed
 out after a bit and then began telling me how angry he was 12 fort jr 7 hoop up was
