 jp dl message from the colonel in chief the year 1993 which was the run up to the 80th anniversary 
 year of the founding of our regiment must have been the most difficult peace time year in our history the 
 many fundamental changes which were required in our whole organization caused many difficulties and there were many problems to be 
 overcome these have been tackled with wholehearted energy in our usual regimental fashion as well as these difficulties my patricia 
 s have undertaken two overseas peacekeeping duties in croatia and i was so very pleased to be able to visit 
 both third and second battalions during their very difficult tours of duty it was very impressive to see the high 
 standards of our regiment so well maintained by all the members of the battalions many of whom were not regular 
 patricia s i am quite sure that our tradition will ensure that these high standards will always be maintained whatever 
 the problems still to be faced and i am very proud to be your colonel in chief 
 2 the patrician 1993 colonel of the regiment princess patricia s canadian light infantry major general h c pitts mc 
 cd message from the colonel of the regiment as this piece is being written 1994 is just getting under way 
 and all indications are that it will be a very busy year for the regiment the challenges ahead seem all 
 the greater because of the expected squeeze on resources likely to result from the promised defence policy review hopefully we 
 ll see a better balancing of resources to tasks both actual and anticipated looking back on 1993 there is much 
 to take pride in as our many accomplishments enhanced the reputation of the regiment third battalion completed its croatian tour 
 and was welcomed back to victoria amid lauditory compliments from civilian and military sources alike second battalion similarly completed its 
 tour started in croatia and finished in krajina to very much the same accolades from all sides here at home 
 second commando of the airborne regiment returned in june from somalia amid the glamour surrounding inappropriate conduct on the part 
 of a few members the outstanding accomplishments under extremely demanding conditions tended to be denigrated however not by us to 
 all who served the regiment and the united nations including attached militia well done thank you ahead of us in 
 1994 first battalion will start its tour in the former yugoslavia in late march some regimental members will also deploy 
 with the strathcona s to the same theatre at about the same time provided the government decides to continue the 
 commitment on the same scale training for the tasking is being done in california where the weather is more favourable 
 than on the prairies before us too is a major change in our regimental structure as the third battalion leaves 
 work point barrack in june and reconfigures as the western 10 90 infantry battalion the proposed reduction to less than 
 100 patricia s and relocation to chilliwack will see a much closer link with our militia colleagues the battalion deserves 
 our congratulations and thanks for a noteworthy 0:notewor 0:thy contribution to the regiment in korea and again since being re 
 constituted in 1970 nearly a quarter century of continuous service since then has passed quickly but not without professionalism and 
 lustre anniversaries bring to mind our regiment s 80th being commemorated at calgary during ist 3rd july 1994 the colonelin 
 chief 0:colonel 0:in 0:chief will be with us to celebrate the occasion this will be the first of our five 
 year reunions leading up to our 100 th in 2014 plan to attend and see the work done in the 
 museum welcome the new colonel of the regiment remember old comrades enjoy the company of patricia s serving and retired 
 enhance the association 0:associa 0:tion and greet lady patricia the units and many people have made a tremendous contribution to 
 our heritage through assistance to the museum it will be completed and on show for all to appreciate don t 
 miss this regimental gathering as we all look forward to renewing friendships and sharing memories of our best years our 
 colonel in chief has just completed a busy regimental year she visited our battalions in yugoslavia twice once in march 
 and again in september in late june and early july together with lord brabourne she visited first and third battalions 
 and the battle school as always her presence amongst her patricia s and their families was much appreciated and enjoyed 
 we all recognize our good fortune in being blessed with the affection of a very special person this will be 
 my last foreword for this publication as your colonel as i leave my appointment in july at calgary three and 
 half plus years have passed all too quickly i realize that the regiment has given me a signal honour to

 4 the patrician 1993 in remembrance remembering a friend for captain jim decoste cd you left without saying goodbye my 
 friend we did not get the chance to shake hands one last time to tell one more war story or 
 see the laughter on your face remember the first time we had met whether it was our age or the 
 mutual respect from the tab it was an instant liking that happens sometimes remember remember our days in charlie the 
 skull and cross bones emblazoned on your helmet some call it bullshit others call it cohesion but you made 33 
 a good place to be remember remember we always gave you the lead that s because we knew you could 
 do it damn it you nearly tamed the monk even i couldn t do that remember remember when we umpired 
 patrol school damn those nights were cold but the srd seemed to warm the soul at least one night in 
 particular remember remember our last time out it was somewhere outside of ottawa arguing as to who was older and 
 why we were doing this remember you have touched our hearts you were a good friend and a damn fine 
 soldier that we will all remember you left without saying goodbye my friend written by captain b e lewis cd 
 capt jim decoste husband friend and astute leader whose tireless efforts were instrumental in providing for the battalion s needs 
 throughout some of our most difficult time while overseas is greatly missed at every stage in his career both commissioned 
 and non commissioned jim always led b example and integrity cpl paul a delmore was a beloved son and family 
 member he will be sadly missed by family and friends here in winnipeg and across canada 
 5 the patrician 1993 cpl john bechard young father husband and fine soldier was a man with a friendly disposition 
 whose smile came easily and usually could be found helping out others days of my life thirty seven gone to 
 heaven served his country well too high a cost too much a loss a summer spent in hell another time 
 another crime puts family on the phone too much the pain too much again a father who s never known 
 an unknown land who ll understand the suffering we have seen or will they care deaths everywhere the heros we 
 have been shots get fired and men get tired just push through another day look at us now and wonder 
 how we carry on this way buddies we had through good and bad didn t think of any others drink 
 or fight stay up all night called these men my brothers the tour ends we re less two friends and 
 words don t seem enough the pain we hide sorrow inside holding on can be so tough back to a 
 life girlfriend or wife try to shut out the death we lie in sleep the dreams we keep wake up 
 to catch some breath these were the days of my life and i don t forget them these were the 
 days of my life please don t forget them remember the days of my life written by pte lovlin although 
 there have been many significant actions accomplished 0:accom 0:plished by 2ppcli in 1993 there were also three major times of 
 sadness three serving members of the battalion met tragic deaths remembrance day 1993 had a more personal and deep meaning 
 for 2vp as on this day we remembered in a very personal way the names and images of fellow patricias 
 we knew worked with befriended and sadly lost each of these three served with the regiment in croatia as it 
 distinguished itself there family and friends alike can be justly proud of the service that each of these men have 
 given to their country and the global community

 the patrician 1993 7 message from the national president princess patricia s canadian light infantry association d arcy j best 
 cd 1993 added another chapter to our regimental history the united nations peacekeeping tours in croatia will be long remembered 
 by the soldiers of the second and third battalions who served there unfortunately the lack of coverage by the news 
 media who seemed to focus all their attention on bosnia gave the impression back home that nothing much was happening 
 in croatia and that our troops were having an easy time of it however we know this was not the 
 case our battalions were very busy in croatia under dangerous and trying conditions often sniped at and shelled they met 
 every challenge their dedication and professionalism set an example for the other un troops and earned the respect of the 
 sector and force commanders the lessons learned will be valuable to the first battalion when they begin their tour in 
 1994 and i am confident they will maintain the standard this has also been a busy year for the association 
 several branches have been collecting and forwarding books condiments 0:condi 0:ments and other hard to get food items to the 
 patricias in croatia and have received numerous letters from soldiers of the battalions expressing their appreciation we intend to provide 
 the same support to first battalion we have begun a campaign to locate militia soldiers who served with our battalions 
 on un duties they are eligible for membership in the association and this is an opportunity for them to maintain 
 their ties with the regiment they can join the branch closest to home or become members at large any assistance 
 in locating these people would be appreciated rhq and members of calgary branch spearheaded by the indomitable rod middleton having 
 been working very hard in preparation for the 80th anniversary reunion in calgary july ist to 3rd unfortunately we won 
 t have many serving soldiers on the ground with first battalion overseas but it will be a great reunion for 
 the old guard looking further ahead there is strong possibility of the association s 1995 annual general meeting being held 
 at camp aldershot nova scotia the most likely date is the second weekend in september this could make for a 
 grand reunion of patricia s living and stationed in the maritimes and for those displaced maritimers who opted to retire 
 from regimental duty in the west a good excuse to make a trip down home this is still tentative but 
 a decision will be announced at the 80th anniversary reunion in calgary meanwhile bon voyage to first battalion we ll 
 miss you at the reunion to all other patricia s i hope to see you in the better ole on 
 july ist always a patricia

 17 the patrician 1993 1993 museum update 1993 was a very productive year in that the wwi bunker and the 
 airborne displays were completed the bunker reproduction 0:repro 0:duction seems to be a favourite amongst the visitors to the gallery 
 as it includes live footage of our men going over the top and a large diorama of the battle of 
 frezenburg which includes approximately 500 hand made figurines each one being distinctive the airborne display is also a significant addition 
 to our museum as the cc 130 hercules aircraft fuselage that is displayed is from the air crash in wainwright 
 alberta on 22 july 1993 the final phase of the gallery has been started with the battle of britain and 
 training in britain scenes the comedy company and regimental family displays and the 1930s barrack room scene are to be 
 completed prior to the 80th anniversary in early july urhorne trooper displa all members and their friends and families are 
 encouraged to visit their gallery at the museum and to see our regimental past brought to life the very popular

 20 first battalion princess patricia s canadian light infantry ma brause and the guard opening the queen elizabeth cup upholding 
 the virtue security and splendour of our nation is not always a simple feat but the first and finest once 
 again met the task with the eloquence and professionalism which is our nature while the vast remainder of the regiment 
 travelled the globe we as a unit defended canada overview the return from the holidays held everyone s favourite event 
 in store the annual technical inspection things went so well that we were blessed with another one shortly after although 
 frustrating everything received a fresh coat of paint so our vehicles looked very nice from a distance the first major 
 event of the year was ex nordic defender 0:de 0:fender for those who were unable to appreciate the wonder and 
 steepness of norwegian mountains in 1992 we deployed to cranbrook bc to engage in the art of snow defences the 
 exercise began with b company defending against c company and then at half time the two switched ends we were 
 joined by a variety of norwegian soldiers and as collateral sent a merry band of our own wanderers from b 
 company to norway as part of the norwegian canadian small unit exchange for those who were unable to appreciate the 
 wonder and steepness of norwegian mountains in 1992 we deployed to cranbrook bc to engage in the art of snow 
 defences shortly after we were off to taste the exquisite weather of wainwright in march here the live fire exercise 
 ex phalanx defender tested our abilities to live four feet underground and defend a battalion defensive position the patrician 1993 
 
 the patrician 1993 21 with memories of wainwright still fresh in our minds the battalion set off once again for 
 the summer concentration those few remaining who had not found a summer job at the battle school gagetown suffield or 
 a number of other vacation spots across canada participated in ex stalwart ram here the battalion continued the relentless defence 
 of canada s west with the kind attendance of the remainder of the brigade many a glass was raised and 
 many a face sulked as we were faced with the challenging task of listening over and over to the war 
 stories of our comrades having just returned from yugoslavia the summer months brought a chance to gasp for a well 
 earned breath and new commanders to the calgary garrison lcol pentney handed command of the battalion to lcol diakow and 
 bgen ashton passed the brigade to bgen cox to bgen ashton and lcol pentney the first battalion wishes you well 
 in your next positions we managed to collect most of our strays from around the country and began the new 
 training year as a relatively new and complete battalion cpl larson striking a handsome pose for gq magazine finally came 
 the annual christmas dinner with lcol diakow exchanging tunics with pte mcconnel after a magnificent 0:magnifi 0:cent meal and first 
 rate dinner entertainment by the drum line we went our separate ways for a well earned holiday as the calgary 
 summer was slowly closing its curtain many of the battalion were invited to join ex western challenge again in our 
 secondary home of denwood alberta shortly after we managed to collect most of our strays from around the country and 
 began the new training year as a relatively new and complete battalion since some of the new members of the 
 unit hadn t been to wainwright for a while we went back this time it was for a series of 
 field firing exercises from team to company level during ex noble patricia as a reward to everyone s hard work 
 we also had the opportunity to complete the battle fitness test and the general waters competition as a dramatic conclusion 
 this exercise officially marked the beginning of our training for op harmony roto 4 autumn struck with a vengeance while 
 conducting the annual pcf cycle including about a hundred reservists the battalion also adopted a un flavour refresher training workup 
 0:work 0:up training lectures dags and routine maintenance and operations filled our days and passed the time away our buildings 
 even began to look the part as bunkers and wire were established to protect the participants of ex poison dart 
 the annual winter cpx december brought the end of a long alliance with our norwegian friends the battalion relinquished our 
 taskings with ace mobile force land and the nato composite force to the canadian airborne regiment the change went with 
 mixed feelings as this unique fraternity ended we are here to meet your needs with convenient banking hours banking by

 22 the patrician 1993 a company 1993 was a budding year for a company at its outset the company consisted 
 of a training cadre a biathlon team and a rifle team we were in effect a training company and rear 
 party when the battalion went on exercise however all that changed during the summer with roto 4 of op harmony 
 in the battalion s future our strength was quickly increased to that of the other two rifle companies over the 
 past year the rifle and biathlon teams from the company have done very well for themselves including several strong finishes 
 in both individual and team biathlon competitions 0:competi 0:tions during ex strong contender 93 the rifle team has an outstanding 
 record winning the lfwa small arms competition 0:compe 0:tition three of our members sgt bidwell cpl beckwith and pte wood 
 went on to be part of the winning letson trophy team at cfsac with cpl beckwith winning top tyro the 
 summer aps provided the company with a wealth of new blood however troops from the battle school were few in 
 number with our new oc and csm both of whom are graduates of the us army ranger school a commando 
 as some of the troops began to refer to the company was anxious three platoon ended up fighting up a 
 60 degree incline through low brush only to arrive on the objective from a different angle than expected and developed 
 a whole new perception of supporting fire to begin training for our expected task in the balkans the major exercise 
 for the latter part of the year was ex noble patricia a field firing exercise from 13 to 24 september 
 the company conducted both dry and live firing from team to company level firing from moving vehicles and snap shooting 
 at moving targets the final field firing range provided some interesting dilemmas as the company attempted to assault a bananashaped 
 0:banana 0:shaped feature when the assault began 1 platoon and the company hq wound up on one side of the 
 feature and 3 platoon ended up on the other what turned out to be the wrong side three platoon ended 
 up fighting up a 60 degree incline through low bush only to arrive on the objective from a different angle 
 than expected and developed a whole new perception of supporting fire the company also participated in a variety of miscellaneous 
 0:miscellane 0:ous training we completed refresher training on the c 6 gpmg navigation and observation also during the last two 
 days the company completed the battle fitness test and the general waters competition cpl teichrib the company medic earned the 
 appreciation of the entire company during those two days putting in long hours staying up past midnight and treating the 
 tender tootsies of the company as with any exercise several memorable moments emerged including cpl magnifico s 18 kilometre trek 
 through a 13 4 coy thinking about trenches do you think that hole is dug yet what do you mean 
 we re almost out of ammo 
 23 the patrician 1993 kilometre navigation course rotten chicken a la king mps lt sbarra 1 pi comd winning the 
 loudest snoring award and mcpl knowles being voted the best dressed despite close competition on november 19 the football team 
 squared off against b company for the french grey cup despite a hard fought battle victory eluded ur stalwart warriors 
 and though winners at heart they were forced to concede defeat despite the loss the efforts of certain members were 
 noteworthy pte binney led an excellent effort by the defence while wo leger and the oc surprised everyone by actually 
 catching the ball mention must be made of cpl doiron who was the driving force behind the team all season 
 and directly responsible for putting a company firmly back on the football map as christmas approached the company found itself 
 guarding 0:guard 0:ing af 16 against all comers during ex poison dart and had a chance to practice some of 
 the drills in preparation for op harmony hopefully the weather will be about 40 degrees warmer in europe six months 
 after coming together the company is well on its way to achieving an excellent standard in all areas and will 
 be ready to do everything asked of it on op harmony nothing like a good meal after a hard day 
 s work b company i january 1993 began in typical army fashion for b company with heliborne training being superimposed 
 upon atis while this made for small chalks and smaller maintenance teams all of our work did pay off as 
 two of our vehicles actually passed the ati too bad one had to be in wainwright and the other in 
 suffield oh well with all that practice we couldn t help but ace the second one february saw us deploying 
 to cranbrook bc for some defensive training in the mountains but being the seasoned travellers that we are canada in 
 the winter doesn t have a great deal of appeal so off we went to norway for perhaps the last 
 time while we spent two weeks skiing to the finnish border and enjoying the benefits of norgie kit and rations 
 we couldn t help but feel for our norwegian counterparts who were being subjected to flames games and the west 
 edmonton mall i m sure the airborne can find something to match our hospitality now that they have assumed the 
 amf l task in march the entire battalion deployed to wainwright for ex phalanx defender digging in proved to be 
 somewhat of a chore however we kept ourselves amused with tales of the phantom backhoe that was said to be 
 roving the area digging in tired companies by day five the ghost backhoe became a reality but as a machine 
 doesn t have the same skills as a soldier with a shovel a certain amount of work was still required 
 to turn holes into trenches living in our better oles became yet another interesting experience as some of the sleeping 
 bays were a bit cramped and some soldiers were a bit nervous at having five feet of dirt over their 
 heads when the shooting started all these problems were forgotten 0:forgot 0:ten the new avgp turrets proved to be very 
 impressive pieces of kit especially its night vision capability the actual live fire portion of the training combined all of 
 our integral weapons supplemented by some battalion resources including the pioneers who kept our heads down with c 4 and 
 two cf 18s who dropped in to strafe some targets special thanks go out to safety staff and in particular 
 sgt paquette who stood out in his ability to point at work and have others do it on our return 
 to cowtown we received a new oc as maj brause assumed command we then left for fort rilea oregon for 
 fibua training though we did have to flesh out our ranks a bit with other members of the battalion the 
 training itself was excellent new ranges and fibua sights allowed everyone to get the most out of the short period 
 we spent in the states of course what would spring and summer be like if we didn t make an 
 annual pilgrimage to wainwright ex stalwart 0:stal 0:wart ram showed that we could put in a decent company attack so 
 for our efforts we got to do a return performance ex western challenge pitted us as enemy to the reserves 
 what a stretch they never knew what hit em garth white member of million dollar club 
 24 the patrician 1993 fall saw us in a familiar setting wainwright for ex noble patricia flakjackets webbing and helmets 
 not to mention the odd radio were the dress of the day for dismounted operations of course the weather cooperated 
 fully it was actually warm in september which really allowed us to enjoy all of our kit the live fire 
 ranges were a good go and allowed us to shake out as a new company of course all of the 
 candidates thought that turning live rounds into empty casings couldn t be all that bad however they never counted on 
 the fully tactical field phase following the exercise we were right into the pcf cycle with our company tasked with 
 running the mg course of c v rse all of the candidates thought that turning live rounds into empty casings 
 couldn t be all that bad however they never counted on the fully tactical field phase preparations for yugoslavia are 
 now in full swing with training and screening fighting for air time b company has been assigned the unique honour 
 of escorting the ldsh rc to bosnia on op cavalier so we won t be with the battalion next summer 
 someone had to hold the strat s hands more trench digging in wainwright following a busy winter and spring of 
 winter exercises spring exercises and non denominational exercises the warn chinook winds of summer slowly faded and the beginning ol 
 the fall brought with it the annual company commandei exchanges maj bartlett passed the torch of command to ma stinson 
 just in time to go on summer block leave how clever c company s first challenge was a mountain operation 
 exercise with the british 22 sas mountain troop ex top slat was very hush hush and as a result very 
 interesting tin concept of the exercise was to test 22 sas equipment anc technical ability to move c company over 
 rugged terrain as luck would have it murphy s law gave us the good the bad and the ugly the 
 good was the opportunity to work with an elite unit like 22 sas and to gain some refresher training from 
 the best the bad was the awful mountain weather rain low cloud poor visibility and some of the white stuff 
 the ugly an early withdrawal from the exercise remember who dares wins or as pte maillet said halfway up the 
 cliff face who cares who wins the next adventure was the 1 cmbg brigade commander change of command parade our 
 task was to coordinate a platoon attack with a section rappelling in with the change of command scroll following an 
 excellent display of daring and action the new commander was so impressed with c company that he now asks for 
 the platoon commander wo davies to personally run all of his display s the next chapter in the c company 
 adventure was down to the serious art of war ex noble patricia brought us to the old stomping grounds of 
 wainwright the usual sore feet followed the battle fitness test the most memorable moments were in bivouac however when the

 26 combat support headquarters company 1993 was a year of challenges and change for the company it began with the 
 return from christmas leave and the preparations 0:prepa 0:rations for ex strong contender and the ati this unique situation found 
 many platoon commanders and 2ics cleaning stoves lanterns and weapons while the soldiers were out practising hockey broomball and military 
 skiing as with all atis vehicles were the priority and everyone found himself burning the midnight oil to get ready 
 for inspection soon following the ati was ex nordic defender in cranbrook bc this exercise would practise the battalion for 
 its amf l role and it was hoped that cranbrook would simulate the fjords and mountains of norway the company 
 found itself broken up to assist both b and c companies as rifle platoons luckily the weather held for the 
 whole deployment most felt that it was good to be exercising in an area other than wainwright and it proved 
 to be a rewarding experience the next major exercise would be the brigade concentration 0:concentra 0:tion ex stalwart ram once 
 again the company was broken up to support the rifle companies during the combat team attacks and various live fires 
 this exercise would be most memorable for the fact that it did not snow in may while the battalion was 
 deployed as summer grew near there were the preparations and drill practices for the change of command parade just prior 
 to this many of the platoons had managed to slip away for a week or two of adventurous training new 
 leadership would appear as the dynamic duo of maj bartlett and csm bludd took over the reigns with the summer 
 aps were the usual changing of faces and positions within the platoons it was about this time that cbt sp 
 company underwent a metamorphosis and changed into hq company as part of the preparation for op harmony bob the body 
 cairns do i drop it on 3 or on go iap in their tow under armour the beginning of september 
 finally saw the return of the bulk of the company members from their various taskings the training for op harmony 
 was beginning to swing into high gear as the company was tasked to run the battalion gun camp in our 
 second home of wainwright ex noble patricia saw hq coy testing out the commander s new sleeping below ground policy 
 it was surprising how comfortable a hole could become if you put your mind to it little time was wasted 
 after the return from ex noble patricia before the start of the pcf cycle the student s ranks swelled as 
 reservists from across the prairies came to be trained every platoon in the company found itself running a pcf course 
 and subsequently deploying once again to wainwright 0:wain 0:wright for the final exercise no sooner had the platoons finished their 
 courses than the preparations for att began which made many wonder if the un deployment would come as a welcome 
 break to the present pace at which the company was running still hq company stands ready to meet the challenges 
 that lie ahead with the confidence of jobs done well in the past battalion tidbit the ist battalion colours were 
 presented by her majesty queen elizabeth ii in victoria b c on 17 july 1959 the colour was emblazoned with 
 22 battle honors the patrician 1993 
 the patrician 1993 27 administration company january saw lis busy with preparations for a winter exercise and the ati and 
 then in february deploying to cranbrook bc ifor ex nordic defender the exercise was held in the lamb creek area 
 a rather difficult piece of terrain in comparison to wainwright with just narrow logging roads for msrs bounded py steep 
 and heavily wooded hills not much room for a echelon vehicles and the ice fishing wasn t that good one 
 of the most difficult tasks for maintenance platoon was to keep the rifle companies losvs and by 206 s running 
 and our own heaters and generators required much attention maintenance and transport platoons aside from their support chores were tasked 
 as a quick reaction force qm was busy from an al echelon location and on several occasions had to fight 
 off an attack on the kitchens with the assistance of the bor staff ex phalanx defender followed during the march 
 april timeframe we returned to our old stomping grounds of wainwright and moved all of lfwa s defensive stores into 
 the guard at curdle hill the ums deployed with the f echelon and under the direction of csm fottcault built 
 the best bunker in the defensive position during may the company deployed once again to wainwright 0:wain 0:wright and bunkered 
 down in peregrine 3 our home away from home for four weeks during ex stalwart ram all of our sections 
 and platoons were kept busy keeping up with the requirements and as well took the opportlinity to prepare for ex 
 western challenge which was to happen in august cqms bunzenmeyer siting the canteen during june we were conducting our post 
 exercise drills stock taking and doing the change of command board of inquiry along with preparing for the activities associated 
 with the change of command the first week of july was change of command week and the battalion hosted a

 the advance party for western challenge deployed to wainwright with somewhat of a half idea of how things would go 
 supporting two composite battalions was an interesting experience because of the unique requirements that existed and the amount of time 
 to do it in these soldiers were eager to train and worked well with us our food services section was 
 kept busy with the feeding of over 700 troops often dispersed over 1000 meals a day the fall of 1993 
 has been intense with training oriented towards op harmony there is an ongoing vehicle preservation 0:preserva 0:tion program clothing parades 
 ranges and new equipment and weapons have been issued to the battalion the company hq participated in ex poison dart 
 and select individuals took an air brake course participated in refresher training and received critical incident stress lectures the company 
 is in good shape to receive our augmentees and begin in earnest our further training for op harmony conclusion a 
 great challenge looms ahead for the first battalion a challenge that was successfully and admirably met by our comrades in 
 the regiment and a significant number of our own soldiers who have been on loan to the other battalions the 
 first battalion is anticipating a rewarding and challenging summer in croatia next year and feel prepared to meet the task

 the old and in with the new for 2ppcli this came true in early 93 with a vengeance as some 
 500 augmentees both regular and reserve were added to the battalion to bring it up to strength for its upcoming 
 tour to croatia the great sth of january shakeup extracted a few familiar faces and added a new contingent of 
 funny cap badges now the royal south saskatchewan fusiliers 0:fusi 0:liers is one thing but gunners and black hats in 
 the patricias a strange start to a strange year fortunately we were too busy to be confused refresher training was 
 the order of the day as we prepared for the yugo tour training began with the very basic soldier skills 
 that w uld make up the early selection phase in determining which individuals would stay and in which job they 
 were to be employed lectures piled upon classes and added to toets made for a quick month then it was 
 off to sunny fort ord for a little suntanning or was that rusting fort ord the deployment to fort ord 
 home of the 7th infantry division light was something one had to experience in order to fully appreciate the battalion 
 deployed to fort ord via i lercules aircraft in the wee hours of the morning 5 feb it w as 
 definitely a change in climate 25c in winnipeg and 20c in monterey talk about a major adjustment over the next 
 three weeks the battalion concentrated on weapons handling and live firing of all of the weapons that would be available 
 in croatia including the 84mm and the 50 cal the work ups culminated in a platoon level live fire attack 
 in betw cen all the range work the battalion was also able to find the time to complete the 13 
 and 16 km marches with the shootin and sloggin over and packs full of px goodies it was time to 
 return home to winterpeg although the record rainfall in california is better than subzero in canada it was still good 
 to get home

 march the advance party departed winnipeg for the capital of croatia when they arrived at lovely camp polom it did 
 what it normally does when the second battalion deploys anywhere it snowed the third battalion was shocked as the weeks 
 prior to our arrival saw temperatures in the 25c range when they arrived at lovely camp poloni it did ivhat 
 it normally does when the second battalion deploys anywhere it snowed on departure of the third battalion each sub unit 
 within the battalion strove to make their work areas and accommodations 0:accommoda 0:tions truly their own in addition 36 personnel 
 from the first and finest joined hq coy these people made up the core of mortar platoon and anti armour 
 platoon and were led by wo jim thurston and wo jim butters for the first three months the battalion group 
 operated routinely sub units familiarized themselves with the local area as well s the people while rifle platoons and support 
 platoons manned heckpoints patrolled areas of responsibility and confiscated capons the battalion group rapidly adjusted to the routine and learned 
 how to do business within the un framework just past the halfway point in the tour the order came to 
 move from sector west to sector south to implement the erdut agreement two companies a and b plus approximately 40 
 of hq and admin coys under the dco maj pete hofman remained in sector west while the majority of the 
 battalion under the co lcol jim calvin deployed to sector south during the tour in yugo each of the companies 
 underweni different tasks and experiences therefore we thought it appropriate 0:appro 0:priate that they each tell their own story with 
 respect to the tour and i found this one in c s o 
 37 the patrician 1993 alpha company the heavy snowfall that greeted members of a company as they arrived in theatre 
 on the 26th of march was probably a harbinger that this was not going to be a particularly easy un 
 tour of duty the company was responsible for the major urban centre of pakrac where the serbs and croatians are 
 most densely populated and live in close proximity to one another we knew that the company was going to have 
 its work cut out for it it was not long before these suspicions were confirmed after assuming command of ortona 
 sector alpha went straight to work establishing our presence in our area and conducting the various patrols and checkpoints that 
 were a part of peacekeeping operations in sector west the company headquarters and 1 pi deployed in the pakrac hotel 
 1 pi under lt john errington and wo ed mclean were very much the hrouble shooters during the tour as 
 they not only patrolled the heavy snoufall that greeted members of a company as they arrived in theatre on the 
 26th of march was probably a harbinger that this was not going to be a particularly easy un tour of 
 duty extensively throughout the company area but they were often the first to mount the many cordon and search operations 
 within the sector 2 pi was commanded by capt scott raesler and wo billy bolen and it was given the 
 onerous task of keeping things under control on the often turbulent croatian of pakrac along with manning the highly sensitive 
 whiskey charlie 8 they also had their share of excitement keeping weapons out of the hands of the local foresters 
 who proved more capable of stripping rifles than trees 3 pi under capt rob taylor and wo steve campbell were 
 kept extremely busy maintaining the battalion s two ammo houses and preventing the serbs who frequented such infamous haunts as 
 the ranchman s and the soccer bar from stirring up too much trouble things heated up quickly for the company 
 in and around pakrac under the guidance of maj john mccomber and mwo ron cameron the company made its presence 
 felt on both sides early in the tour weapon confiscations instilled a grudging respect for the company on both sides 
 of the cfl unfortunately the company also suffered its first casualty in may when sgt hulan was wounded by a 
 booby trap that was positioned in an abandoned bunker by mid tour two events of significance occurred within the company 
 firstly we said farewell to maj mccomber and welcomed the new oc maj craig king secondly the company expanded its 
 operation to take over areas vacated by delta company when the battalion deployed to sector south 1 pi assumed responsibility 
 for the town of lipik and what had once been an area of concern became a more tranquil region thanks 
 to some active patrolling and some low level negotiations owing to its key role in sector west alpha company remained 
 as the last canadian infantry element in the sector by 24 aug we were placed under command of argbat and 
 by 1 sep we had handed over ortona sector to an argbat company until our own deployment to sector south 
 we remained as argbat s reserve we arrived in sector south on 9 sep to the sounds of artillery fire 
 as the croatians launched their attack into medak what was supposed to be a slow time for us ended on 
 14 sep when we were ordered to relieve delta company in the obrovac area within hours we packed our kit 
 and company stores and moved some 60 kilometres to our new area once in location we once again began the 
 business of patrolling clucking the occasional artillery and tank round and getting ready for a handover this time to 1

 the patrician 1993 39 july marked the start of the dreaded pavement patrols morale soared to new heights as the 
 whole company sat out on the sunbaked drag watching croatian paving crews pretend to work hours seemed like days fortunately 
 due to the fact that trob the rest of the battalion was by now playing softball in sector south all 
 leave was cancelled there was much rejoicing if it hadn t been for mcpl dean campbell there would have been 
 nothing to do but complain as it was we ate hot nnamon buns and complained july marked the start of 
 the dreaded pavement patrols by late august the battalion had gotten into some trouble in sector south and the call 
 went out for b coy to save the day visions of sun and sea danced in our heads but they 
 were quickly replaced by sandbags and sentry duty we arrived at the new coy hq in time to see our 
 kenyan buddies bugging out anc i a mob of angry serbs collecting a typical local welcome from the cheery folks 
 of miranje gornje after much shouting things settled down and we started taking stock of our new surroundings nice houses 
 lousy neighbourhood tanks off the front doorstep anti tank guns 301 m to the left sheep everywhere at least they 
 don t seem to be shelling each other famous last words two weeks and two million sandbags later the place 
 was looking more presentable and we decided to start expanding the b coy empire wo wood and 4 pi became

 commissionaires of the new un crossing point at miranje donje and 6 pi set up op sudden death on what 
 turned out to be a crack thump range for croatian mortars as the month wore on the rest of the 
 battalion gathered together for a rest holiday at hotel medak leaving as usual b coy holding up the whole damn

 with the remainder of the battalion to sector south the company initially deployed to kijevo camp bedrock in anticipation of 
 enforcing a peace agreement in the peruca dam area the agreement never materialized and after four weeks of enduring sweltering 
 heat conducting ops the pwts and refresher training the battalion received direction to replace the french battalion located further north 
 c coy conducted a relief in place of two french companies in the last week of august on 2 sep 
 9 pi had found a new house in medak and had moved one section commanded by sgt trenholm to occupy 
 it that same day later that evening the new house received a baptism of fire by two rather inebriated serbian 
 soldiers forttmately sgt trenholm s use of effective warning shots silenced the belligerents a week later on 9 sep the 
 croatians launched a major offensive into the medak pocket and made extensive use of artillery fire over a wide area 
 from the mali alan to gracac 11 sep began as another relatively calm day but one that later saw three

 zone in the wake of the withdrawal of croatian forces to their pre 9 sep 93 positions c coy was 
 tasked with interposing between serbian and croatian forces on the south western position of the pocket while a french company 
 did the same in the north at this time only the serbs had agreed to the plan and at 0800 
 hours the morning of 15 sep the oc maj bailey and the three platoon commanders conducted a reconnaissance 0:reconnais 0:sance 
 of the forward serb positions in order to abbreviate battle procedure platoons were called forward and put into their positions 
 immediately after the joint reconnaissance was completed 8 pi was deployed first into the area of sitnik in which they 
 were subject to heavy direct and indirect fire 9 pi deployed into the forward centre and were met with sporadic 
 sniper and machine gun fire from the croatians after much vigorous un flag waving and warning shots the platoon was 
 able to move forward into positions 7 pi was given the task of establishing a crossing site on the medak 
 gospic highway after a close encounter with a tilt rod minefield they prepared and maintained two checkpoints supported by a 
 tua section c coy made a significant contribution to the success of the medak operation by establishing positions between the 
 serbian and the croatian forces thus demonstrating the necessary resolve to gain croatian acceptance of the buffer zone plan the 
 buffer zone was soon established and c coy ended the tour with the responsibility of securing the southern portion of

 harder to come by but the situation between the two sides was close to open war on 18 sep with

 43 the patrician 1993 third battalion princess patricia s canadian light infantry excitement turbulence and transition are terms often used 
 by infantry units when reflecting upon the events and activities of the previous year yet for the third battalion in 
 1993 these three terms particularly the latter two would become much more relevant than ever before 3 ppcli began 1993 
 at the mid point of its op harmony peacekeeping tour with unprofor in sector west croatia the third battalion was 
 called upon to respond to hardening attitudes on the part of both croatia ns and krajina serbs while the first 
 half of the tour had been spent gaining an extensive familiarization of the operational area the pace of activity increased 
 dramatically in the new year as the third battalion was called upon to respond to hardening attitudes on the part 
 of both croatians and krajina serbs after a january battalion level cordon and search of serbian police houses and two 
 months of reinforcement operations into the jordanian and nejiale se contingents 3 ppcli was only too happy to let fellow 
 patricias from 2 ppcli have a go at life in the former republic of yugoslavia though the excitement may have 
 ended the turbulence as only just beginning as members of the battalion speculated how their lives would be affected by 
 the restructuring process needed to transform 3 ppcli into a 10 90 infantry battalion pon return to canada ironically the 
 return finally allowed for the formal subbie s indoctrination of the last seven junior officers who had arrived at the 
 third battalion prior to croatia celebrated with much singing and just a touch of slivovitz by august the 825 strong 
 battalion from croatia had been reduced to a mere 385 following the april release of reserve augmentation and a host 
 of postings to calgary wainwright petawawa and chilliwack upon the completion of the usual rash of individual summer taskings and 
 with the prospect of a new home station in chilliwack firmly established 3 ppcli entered a new phase its last 
 year in victoria as what lcol nordick has aptly described a unit in altered circumstances training exercises and social events 
 ensued throughout the fall but with the sole remaining rifle company gearing up for another tour in croatia with 1 
 ppcli and the rest of 3 ppcli preparing for a move to chilliwack 1993 ended with life far from normal

 the outset of 1993 wreaking havoc on equipment operability yet the soldiers of canbat 1 continued to apply themselves with

 and potentially hazardous the battalion firmly established in sector west had expanded patrol patterns developed un installations improved living conditions

 force teams took part in a four day long range patrol the latter teams were required to cover more than 
 ninety kilometres over some of the toughest terrain wales has to offer in just two and a half clays of 
 marching before during and after the patrol the teams were assessed on a variety of tasks including first aid media

 in dawson city on november 11th mother nature still refused to cooperate with major fisher the yukon river remained unfrozen 
 thus denying access to the preferred training area the distant hunker summit was chosen as the alternative this separated the

 in the heated municipal yard workshop in spite of the delayed deployment training was rescheduled and began early on 12 
 november platoons participated in a round robin including losv driving winter survival and tracking trapping during this phase the dawson 
 rangers were tasked with imparting their knowledge and experience to the soldiers in fact the training was excellent and the 
 standard ant professionalism of the dawson city patrol was outstanding simultaneously wos murphy and vigue assisted capt staniowsk with training 
 a group of rangers from all across the yukon the company then began phase two involving a platooi ambush raid 
 task and a number of field firing ranges eacl platoon had a section of rangers attached for the duration o

 for road hockey and tackle football games which proved quite an experience at 35c winning made the bone crunching tackles 
 and bloody noses all worthwhile the day was capped by a potlatch supper hosted by the dawson first nation this 
 was quite a feast with plenty of moose and caribou and was rumoured to have been the largest community supper

 last christmas in hollywood upon the return of 3 ppcli personnel from ex poison dart 93 the pre christmas festivities 
 began with a busy week of company and battalion functions and sports b company kicked off the season on the 
 10th with some skeet shooting at the local range it is debatable whether or not this was part of the 
 festivities or merely an excuse to get the csm on the range again after managing to squeeze in another couple 
 of days of work the remainder of the christmas events started in earnest on the 15th the battalion sports finals 
 were held after a season in which admin company dominated all three sports and easily achieved all finals b company 
 and combat support were able to stack their respective teams to combat the threat unfortunately 0:unfortu 0:nately this method worked 
 and a stretched admin company was not at all victorious combat support captured the ball hockey crown and b company 
 took volleyball and flag football combat support devoted the remainder of the day to inter rank floor hockey matches and 
 the youth and speed of the cpl ptes prevailed in a chain of command race a casual beer and bbq 
 affair was then enjoyed by all admin company took a different approach and held a jacket and tie affair at 
 the sherwood inn lots of good grub music christmas cheer and numerous draws made it a good all round party 
 yet though almost all the troops appeared to have dates most of the lonely admin company officers regrettably did not 
 thursday morning saw the mcpls triumph in a rousing ball hockey match though not without a bit of bumping and 
 advice from the cpl ptes the next game pitted the sr ncos against the officers in a tight contest in 
 which age treachery and perhaps some help from the referees brought about a loss for the officers the men s 
 christmas dinner soon followed though a lcol andrews appeared somewhat unclear as to what he was empowered to do until 
 some sound advise from the rsm was offered it was a good spread and the men were out of there 
 quickly to carry on the revelry at the jr ranks the officers at home to the sr ncos brought the 
 day to its festive conclusion barring those who continued on to lt ankersen s stag party the new co comfortably

 crete and djibouti with little more than refuelling stops enroute having departed petawawa in december to arrive in somalia into 
 40c temperatures was an incredible adjustment the commando lived in trenches and conducted operations out of balidogle until 28 december 
 whereupon a joint airmobile air landing assault was undertaken by the airborne regiment battle group vanguard and 10 mountain division 
 us to seize and hold the airfield at belet uen for the better part of a month the soldiers of

 the first time in many years broom i 100 was played at griesbach barracks with the officers and senior ncos 
 fighting it out to a two all tie this was followed by a reception complete with moose milk where the 
 game was replayed and the usual lies and tall tales told prior to the game itself rsm collier baked a

 the rest of the regiment from those of us serving on the windswept plains of saskatchewan we are pleased to 
 report that all members of our small but erstwhile group have managed to weather yet another year of climactic extremes 
 in good health and in most cases in good humour like 1992 this past year has been a busy one 
 for the patricias of saskatchewan district while many of our comrades were gainfully employed keeping the peace in the balkans 
 we continued to slog through a never ending campaign of paperwork 0:paper 0:work back here on the home front so 
 much for our peers predictions that there wouldn t be any excitement or job satisfaction for an infantryman in saskatchewan 
 in all honesty though it hasn t been all paper in paper out both the north saskatchewan regiment and the 
 royal regina rifles maintained a very busy training schedule throughout 0:through 0:out the first half of 1993 and the knowledge 
 of the ppcli support staff was well exercised in assisting the planning and conduct of various ftxs cpxs and tewts 
 of course op harmony has also had a significant impact on district and unit level training intensive preparatory training and 
 screening for rotos 2 and 4 were conducted at militia training detachment 0:detach 0:ment dundurn to ensure that saskatchewan reservists 
 met the grade when they joined the regiment for their tours as usual the past summer was a busy one 
 and our crew found themselves heavily involved in the conduct of arts nrqs courses at the various schools operated throughout 
 lfwa this was of course followed by ex western challhn 0:chal 0:lhn 1h in yvainw right during august post summer 
 we quickly got to work on providing progressive training for the soldiers of the n sask r and the rifles 
 the requirement for effective mission oriented infantry training at the unit level particularly ion light of current reserve participation in 
 un missions ensured that our small group of patricias was kept gainfully employed throughout the fall on the social side 
 of the house the highlight of our year was once again the annual reunion hosted by the saskatchewan 0:saskatch 0:ewan 
 branch of the regimental association continuing a practice which began last year the serving members and the association within saskatchewan 
 joined forces to celebrate regimental day in proper fashion over the 19 21 march weekend in prince albert all in 
 attendance will agree that the 1993 reunion regimental day celebration was a tremendous success in addition to serving and regimental

 77 the patrician 1993 french grey battalion cfb gagetown patricia s of cfb gagetown headquarters company infantry school having leopard 
 crawled their way into positions of influence 0:influ 0:ence the patricias in headquarters company do their best on a daily 
 basis to frustrate and confound their fellow soldiers at every turn all in the name of fostering a patricia dynasty 
 in scenic new brunswick the master plan is complicated and you won t find it written down anywhere but be 
 assured that given the breadth of their authority our intrepid brothers are able to achieve their insidious ends in a 
 number of ways starting at the top of the heap there is major romus blekaitis the vaunted lithuanian grizzly in 
 addition to his regular duties as the chief instructor he has gone to the soul of the organization by reintroducing 
 career conscious captains to the officers mess both on the job and off he sets an impressive standard of hospitality 
 his opposite number at the ncm level is cwo forde who makes a mighty contribution in the area of personal 
 fitness among others during the monthly 10 km school runs in which everyone participates he has come to bear a 
 strong resemblance to the energizer bunny going and going and going captain mike minor is the chief standards officer a 
 veteran of four years standing this experience has given him the uncanny ability to know exactly when it is appropriate 
 to make a point by standing on the conference table clutching a training standard pam and shouting to the heavens 
 just like charleton 1 estoft in the ten commandments he is assisted more or less ably by captains dan blister 
 and mike vernon the former is a threat both for his association with the whole 10 km run thing he 
 s the sports officer you see and his unnerving habit of asking penetrating questions about the reams of paper that 
 never stop circulating dan just sign it and send it to someone else didn t they teach you anything at 
 staff school 
 78 the patrician 1993 as for captain vernon he s too immersed in editing the infantry journal scan planning donchaknow 
 to disrupt anything by attending to his primary duties as a standards officer he has to leave the army you 
 see because of the very real danger of someday having to work for someone whose article he haughtily rejected for 
 publication capt mike vernon capt dan brister but forget about the officers and senior ncos the real nerve centre of 
 the conspiracy is the training aids section from their vantage point near the main entrance not only can they monitor 
 the work habits of everyone else in the school but the real nerve centre of the conspiracy is the training 
 aids section they also control the resources that keep it functioning as a bureaucracy what would happen for example if 
 private yelle one day just decided he wasn t going to photocopy ever again if corporal wilson sat down at 
 the next parade and refused to take another grip and grin photo if corporal wiper decided the school s instructors 
 could just get their own damn pams chaos pure and unadulterated a coy patricias have been persevering to maintain the

 training area which we know and love for those that are unaware it should be mentioned that b company holds 
 the pioneer and mortar cells in addition to the ql6b bioc phase 111 and loft cells the year started with 
 a bang literally for the patricias in the advanced pioneer cell with the entire cell heading to jamaica to train 
 24 members of the jdf in a basic pioneer course the course was completed successfully after which some relaxation on 
 the beaches and in the clear blue waters took place currently the rumour is that the cell will be going 
 back again this spring to run a second course however to date this is unsubstantiated the year started ivith a 
 hang literally for the patricias in the advanced pioneer cell with the entire cell heading to jamaica spring and summer 
 found the members of b company busy running portions of the phase training and another memorable ql6b course with the 
 fall came both the advanced mortar and assault pioneer courses the courses both ran from late september to november leaving 
 entire sections of the training area in smouldering ruin the close of 1993 found most of us on some well 
 earned leave following which the members of the mortar cell found out that they would in fact run an advanced 
 mortar course in the spring of 1994 c coy this year 1 3 of c coy at the infantry school 
 is made up of patricias c coy is responsible for the small arms instructors course the master sniper course and 
 bioc phase 11 like all members of c coy the patricias are working hard and have the additional task of 
 adjusting to life in eastern canada thus far we have not received any requests to re badge to the other 
 english speaking regiment from any patricias who may wish to prolong their stay in gagetown support coy this year has 
 been a typically busy one for the patricias of support company the role of providing support to every course that 
 the school conducts leaves very little time to relax but is an excellent opportunity to keep in touch with the

 fifty soldiers to the ppcli units serving in the former yugoslavia on the upcoming tour with the first battalion the

 the loyal eddies maintains its airborne tasking the unit regularly conducts airborne exercises as well as support to cabc and

 in what has now become a tradition the regiment was represented by two serving members captain mike minicola of lfchq 
 st hubert and private mike jackson of 2 ppcli winnipeg as is also the tradition neither of the other regiments 
 contributed players the tournament was held in treviso italy from 14 30 may 1993 in what was one of the 
 strongest competitions in recent years the team finished a solid 9th both captain minicola and private jackson played instrumental roles 
 in the team s success supplying a great deal of the team s scoring and rebounding as well as providing 
 the backbone of the team s combativeness moreover the two went to great lengths to instruct the kinder gentler members 
 of the contingent on the importance of being blessed with the regimental spirit vp 
 the patrician 1993 89 op marquis kraloor by captain don bourne the call for volunteers for op marquis in cambodia 
 came early january 1993 approximately ten days after my yugoslavia task was cancelled i volunteered to go to sunny phnom 
 penh joining me for this tour were fellow patricia s capt john shorten and warrant officer max anderson they were 
 tasked to the reception control unit within the un elq s in phnom penh and i was assigned as the 
 canadian contingent adjutant was amazed at how eager they were to leave the country to get to cambodia it took 
 three days aboard a cf 707 in which we spent a gruelling evening in each of hawaii guam and thailand 
 we arrived in phnom penh cambodia on the 11 april 1993 we were quickly met by our counterparts and whisked 
 away to commence our turnover i was amazed at how eager they were to leave the country as we drove 
 the eight kilometres from the airport into phnom penh we had our first opportunity to view the khmer culture and 
 the busy streets of our home we would never get use to the thousands of mopeds on the streets the 
 next day while clearing into un headquarters i ran into major phil cook and captain steve kroone both working in 
 the hq operation cell they were both in cambodia on a one year un tasking and had been there for 
 almost eight months by the time we arrived the un component was called untac or united nation transitional authority in 
 cambodia at the time of our deploy ment in april 93 untac was the largest united nations deployment since korea 
 there were 16 infantry battalions with logistics and engineer battalions from over 34 countries to help out there were over 
 22 000 un personnel in theatre including 5 000 civilians mind you the way the headquarters operated you would think 
 that the 17 000 military component was there to support them the canadian contingent totalled some 214 personnel with approx 
 125 in 92 transportation company stationed approximately ten kilometres outside phnom penh 42 un hq s staff of ficers in 
 phnom penh another 30 observers spread throughout the country and the remainder as contingent personnel and engineers untac was in 
 cambodia to conduct an election after they spent the last 13 years in a destructive civil war the peace accord 
 occurred in late 1991 with the first troop deployment around feb 1992 we were the third canadian contingent to deploy 
 to cambodia with a fourth in the works however that one was cancelled due to the success of the elections 
 and the fact that the military component was to leave cambodia by the 15 nov 93 and that meant that 
 we were to extend for another month and a half when we arrived in cambodia in early april we heard 
 the sounds of gunfire every evening outside our living accommodations 0:accommo 0:dations the outgoing personnel explained that this was due 
 to the khmer new year which lasted a week however a week after they had left the sounds of gunfire 
 continued we quickly realized that the shootings occurred every night regardless of new year s or not soon the stories 
 of gunfights outside our accommodations began surfacing from our new aussie and kiwi friends who had been living at the 
 same place for the last eight or nine months we were left wondering what we got ourselves into because none 
 of this was reported to us back in canada but like everywhere else we got accustomed to the sounds and 
 never really stirred in our rooms unless we heard machine gun fire outside the building soon we were set into 
 our routine visiting familiar places over and over to make the time pass on several occasions all the patricia s 
 gathered together for a few drinks mostly at the villa that maj cook and capt kroone rented this was one 
 of the few times we could sit down to a home made meal compliments of maj cook and his fine 
 culinary skills i still haven t found out were he got the beef because it was delicious to say the 
 least in cambodia anything resembling beef had to be shipped in from australia 
 90 the patrician 1993 the first three months were the hardest because of the elections in june and the fact 
 the khmer rouge had stated that they would stop the election at all costs even targeting un personnel but then 
 that was nothing new as the infantry battalions were being mortared ambushed and shot at on a regular basis one 
 statistic that was proved to be very interesting 0:interest 0:ing was that by mid may of 1993 unprofor had 45 
 deaths but untac was at 79 deaths before my departure our death numbers were over 100 un personnel a little 
 know fact but one of the reasons why we received the hostility bonus with unprofor as one sitrep reported situation 
 normal killings 0:kill 0:ings continue during the month of june we saw the departure of major cook and capt kroone 
 and the arrival of capt keith macdonald he replaced capt kroone and he quickly adapted to the working realities of 
 the un and cambodia once the elections were over at the end of june untac concerned itself with installing the 
 elected council and government 0:govern 0:ment it was not as easy as it seems but by august 1993 the coalition 
 government was in power and untac now concentrated 0:concen 0:trated on departing the theatre with the phased withdrawal all sections 
 in the headquarters saw personnel departing at different times capt shorten left near the beginning of october wo anderson around 
 the beginning of november myself on the 13 november and capt macdonald on the 15th it was also wonderful to 
 see the people rebuilding their cities their homes and their lives amidst all this destruction but the most amazing thing 
 that i saw was the smile on the children s faces and the determination of its people to vote for 
 a new way of life something we in the western world have taken for granted and as with most un 
 tours you meet new friends from different countries and maintain a bond throughout your lifetime most of us did manage 
 to visit vietnam and thailand which on each occasion proved very interesting to actually see the places in vietnam where 
 the americans and nva fought on the ground instead of on television or videos was truly amazing walking around siagon 
 and seeing the free market capitalist society in a communist country was also a pleasant surprise to say the least 
 the tour was interesting with many memories i iwever some of them will not be fond memories seeing the poverty 
 and destruction all around the human suffering to children teenagers and adults from the over 6 million mines strewn throughout 
 the country and the continued fighting massacres and assassinations brought to mind the frailties of life itself in a nation 
 still at war at the end of the tour it was a very good feeling to be back at home

 ppcli as a member of the party relieving capt schmidt and his fellow canadian unmos the mission of the un 
 was similar in both angola and mozambique to establish peaceful and secure conditions for supervised free elections while resettling millions 
 of refugees and re establishing normal economic life in angola for a number of reasons the un mission failed following 
 the september 30 92 election the unita rebels refused to accept the result fighting broke out once again and the 
 un was forced to evacuate immediately the brutal and destructive civil war there continues sporadically until the present mozambique on 
 the other hand has so far proven to be a un success story after 15 years of civil war between 
 the marxist frelimo government and the renamo rebels both sides reached a state of mutual exhaustion demobilization has begun in 
 mozambique and a new army is being created from members of the two opposing sides although the acid test will 
 come with the october 94 elections things look good for a peaceful conclusion and a safe return of un forces 
 including the 15 canadian unmos serving there because africa is such an amazing surprising and contradictory 0:contra 0:dictory place it 
 would be pointless to try to describe it properly in words alone instead capts schmidt and banks have pooled some 
 of their photo collections to produce the accompanying selection in africa certainly a picture is worth a thousand words what 
 was the greatest lesson of their time in africa that canadians don t appreciate what they have at home in

 3b the patrician 1993 cyprus a retrospect on june 15 1993 the last canadian manned observation post in cyprus was 
 handed over to another contingent thus ending a legacy that spanned almost 30 years and three generations for the regiment 
 the period of commitment was on june 15 1993 the last canadian manned obsetvation post in cyprus was handed over 
 to another contingent thus ending a legacy that spanned almost 30 years and three generations somewhat shorter 23 years and 
 13 tours from 1968 to 1991 not counting tours by 2 commando but it will leave a mark in our 
 corporate memory for some time to come the following is a brief account of the regiments commitment to cyprus in 
 addition are a series of photographs taken during the tours of 1968 1984 and 1991 the ppcli first arrived in 
 cyprus in the form of ist battalion in april 1968 the unit was augmented by x battery of 3 rcha 
 and b squadron of fort garry horse at that time the deployment 0:deploy 0:ment called for a three company commitment 
 which was deployed north in an area centred around kyrenia recce platoon and b squadron fgh conducted mounted patrols between 
 the observation posts manned by the rifle companies the tour was described by the battalion as being quiet with no 
 major disturbances however for individuals many so called minor incidents occurred which tested section platoon and company commanders skills in 
 negotiating their way out of potentially violent situations temblos op 1968 tearing down cliffside op this state of affairs continued 
 in very much the same vein for 3 ppcus tour in 1970 71 1 ppcli again in 1971 and 2 
 ppcli in 1972 73 however the make up and deployment of the units changed somewhat as they eventually found themselves 
 deployed 0:de 0:ployed in and around nicosia itself with only two rifle companies suburb and city this was the situation 
 in the summer of 1974 when the canadian airborne regiment including 2 commando found itself in the middle of an 
 interethnic 0:inter 0:ethnic misunderstanding that divided the island and established the buffer zone that exists to this day 
 96 the patrician 1993 by 1975 76 when 3rd and 2nd battalions did consecutive tours the atmosphere ivas tense but 
 improving each battalion set to work normalizing the status quo and improving living conditions obviously more happened then has been 
 briefly alluded to here however the chief enemy noted by every unit on every tour was boredom to ward off 
 its affects many methods were employed from extra pt and sports competitions to building bunkers self help projects and tours 
 on and off the island it appears activities were limited only by inertia and ones imagination while cyprus was hot 
 nine of the 13 tours were in summer and only very occasionally operationally exciting it provided an excellent vehicle for 
 building cohesion at section and platoon level whether at blue beret camp in the various sections of headquarters or on 
 the line cyprus was very much a training ground in the art of low level negotiation and junior leadership beaver 
 lodee 1991 by 1975 76 when 3rd and 2nd battalions did consecutive tours the atmosphere was tense but improving each 
 battalion set to work normalizing the status quo and improving living conditions this was pretty much the same story for 
 every battalion from the first in 1978 through successive tours in 1980 3rd bn 82 83 2nd bn 84 ist 
 bn 88 3rd bn 90 2nd bn and 91 ist bn with each tour came boundary changes as the canadian 
 sector shrunk and expanded to conform to new realities this meant modifications in living arrangements the inevitable logistic problems and 
 new operational requirements in fact for over twenty years this un tour provided a sense of purpose that outside of 
 germany appeared to be missing in the 70 s and 80s given today s current commitments cyprus may indeed seem 
 tame however to paraphrase an observation 0:observa 0:tion made at the end of ist battalions 1971 tour it was good

 another very active and successful year the year started out with the mnning of a tag day with the other

 it s not going to rain well the warrant got his wish the following weekend when the corps joined the 
 manitoba branch of the association at brookside cemetery we were there to pay individual respects and plant flags at the 
 resting place of all patricias at that cemetery the weather seemed all too fitting for the day overcast 0 degrees 
 howling winds and pelting sleet it was a very harsh day but the cadets carried out their duties with respect 
 and dedication this was followed by a service and wreath laying at the cemetery s monument october saw the unit 
 doing rappel tower training in garrison followed by a challenging weekend of rappelling on the cliffs of white dog lake 
 ont patrolling and fieldcraft skills were of course mixed in sgt furchner and his staff from 2ppcli really helped to 
 make this exercise a success the cadets went the corps band onto taking first at the manitoba army cadet league

 on the coldest day of winter the daytime temperature was a balmy 26 celsius thankfully there was little wind but 
 the wind chill was still 2600 cadets quickly found out that forgetting the steel pegs makes putting up tents in 
 winter a no go and that plastic pegs bend nicely when one tries to hammer them into frozen ground by 
 spring members of the band had attended three provincial training camps the drum line had carried out several performances the 
 highlight being the performance for d coy before they left for un duty 17 medical company conducted both emergency and 
 standard first aid courses for the unit the rifle team of course had another successful year winning all provincial postal

 of the infantry d inf will be informing divisional colonels commandant of his proposed future structure of the infantry on 
 16th december 1993 it is hoped that two papers emanating from the queen s and light divisions on the future 
 structure of the infantry and in support of the large regiments will have influenced and be reflected in d inf

 reports that his no 1 priority had been to complete in september this year his battalion tour at omagh on 
 a high note he believed this had been achieved his battalion was now in alexander barracks dhekelia cyprus whose 8 
 man barrack rooms had proved something of a culture shock for the single soldiers after their individual bedrooms 0:bed 0:rooms 
 in lisanelly barracks they were the garrison battalion and were much busier than expected there were many visitors among them 
 the colonel in chief at the time of the commonwealth prime ministers conference there were good opportunities for sport and 
 fun there were possibilities of welfare problems with 188 families living in larnaka he was now concentrating on training the 
 battalion in its light role and he was planning exercises in jordan and kuwait in preparation for a tour of 
 duty in the falklands next year the rep col comd confirmed that he had heard very good reports of the 
 battalion from various quarters in the province when visiting in july and he congratulated the battalion on a most successful 
 tour on being questioned whether the queen realised she was among a battalion of one of her regiments co 1 
 rgj replied that she did because she had been cranked up by the lord lieutenant of london field marshal lord 
 bramall 6 2 rgj lt col snagge reports that his battalion had assumed the amf l role in april this 
 year and that an exercise in denmark in the summer had been its first venture in this role a the 
 mind its new role provides the battalion with a good structure for training and he was concentrating on leadership at 
 the lower levels junior nco s and section commanders his young officers were of a high standard and the riflemen 
 arriving from ouston were very satisfactory b the body recruiting was his highest priority and almost all the support for 
 it had to come from his battalion he was also concentrating on the standard of shooting which was improving he 
 now had 80 marksmen and hoped to improve to 90 next year the bugle platoon had won the uklf sf 
 competition and 2 rgj platoons had come ist 2nd and 7th in the amf march and shoot competition in denmark 
 which had previously always been won by the germans his good games players were becoming involved in local teams and

 the departure of the band the new dover branch of the rgj association had recently held its inaugural dinner and 
 it had been well attended and proved a great success d the future next year he had planned with his 
 successor lt col n r parker that the focus for training would be norway and that the battalion would strive 
 to improve its shooting and biathlon he would continue to support recruiting painful as it was the rep col comdt

 maintained an active interest in its affiliated acf ccf detachments 300 had gone to annual camp 90 to gibraltar and

 we really didn t want a tank hulk parked outside the front gate we ensured that as much green jacket 
 influence as possible was applied after all we really didn t want a tank hulk parked outside the front gate 
 amongst it all we have found the time to train around 1100 recruits though our official annual capacity is somewhere 
 over 2300 of the male recruits around 450 have progressed to their phase ii training at ouston in northumberland and 
 then on into their regiments within the light division all army recruits now have to complete a standard ten week 
 course before they can be released for their further specialist training whether as infantrymen or within any other part of 
 the military organisation 0:organisa 0:tion our green jacket trained soldiers attend the combat infantryman s course at ouston just outside 
 newcastle the royal green jacket influence is not lost as we provide a large proportion of the training staff and 
 the ncos are given the opportunity to impart their special knowledge to recruits who will end up in corps and 
 regiments right across the army despite having to share our home we appreciate the constructive 0:construc 0:tive contribution made by

 continue to deploy 2 companies 0:compa 0:nies on operation at any one time one to rockwood near castlederg close to 
 the tyrone donegal border and the other here in omagh itself where it operates under command of the 4th battalion 
 the royal irish regiment the third company looks after our security camp guard vehicle escorts and so on but on 
 occasions has been known to deploy elements in order to assist in operations and the fourth company on training and 
 or leave long gone are the days when operational success was measured by tangibles such as finds of weapons and 
 arrests made but the more subtle campaign to alter public attitudes and to enable a return to normality to take 
 place is much harder to measure needless to say the riflemen are the best weapon we have and as the 
 number of complaints against the army falls so the amount of confidence in the army increases the professionalism cheerfulness and 
 humour of all ranks when in contact with the local population have done wonders to increase faith in the army 
 and we have seen cups of tea and information offered in areas that would have been unthinkable 0:unthink 0:able when 
 we arrived a steady flow of tangible success continue however with finds of terrorist material and arrests particularly in and 
 around the historically fiercely republican town of strabane each incident serves not only to improve our own morale but also 
 dispirits the enemy and instils much needed confidence in the local population we moved to cyprus in september and have 
 enjoyed the settling down period which has been anything but quiet the battalion began to retrain in the role of 
 intervention with c company undertaking a three week exercise in november in the llnited arab emirates planning is well underway 
 for the deployment to the falkland islands in march of 94 of d company group and to south georgia of 
 the recce platoon the future looks like being varied and challenging given the unpredictability of the middle east we are 
 determined to enjoy the change play hard and find excitement and if possible relax a little 2nd battalion the pace 
 of life has picked up in the battalion as the year has progressed ever since the platoon competition run in 
 wales in may training has been directed towards our forthcoming 0:forthcom 0:ing deployment to norway as the uk amf l 
 allied mobile force land battalion once our commitments in support of the light division s memorable retreat at horseguards were 
 complete 0:com 0:plete the rifle companies began a series of individual exercises in june and july these culminated in scotland 
 with a test exercise run by the commanding officer based at garelochheacl this was extremely demanding both in terms of 
 its physical demands and tactical scenario each company infiltrated over 50 80 kilometers of highland country including the crossing of 
 a loch in small boats before attacking a difficult objective based on an old royal navy test facility needless to 
 say it poured with rain most of the time august was largely a leave period prior to the battalion s

 for the rifle companies and the courses necessary to drive our oversnow vehicles and live with the equipment which is 
 peculiar to a cold weather deployment in addition the battalion began a year long period as the trial unit for 
 combat soldier 95 which is the army s latest combat uniform little different in appearance from the previous issue it 
 comprises a complete set of clothing which in various combinations is suitable for wear from the arctic to the jungle 
 the new boots have already proved to be a success and we wait to see how the remainder of the 
 equipment stands up to the cold in october a company and the peninsula band mounted another successful kape keep the 
 army in the public eye tour the first week was spent in liverpool and the second which involved the london 
 area was based in connaught barracks it turned out to be easier to move the school children to dover than 
 to base the tour group in woolwich the end of the tour was marked by an open day on 13 
 november in aid of the army benevolent fund which sadly suffered badly from appalling weather conditions there are plans for 
 another open day next summer when hopefully we will be able to capitalise on the arrival of the tour de 
 france in dover details will be promulgated nearer the date at the time of writing the battalion is once again

 light infantry and militia in a bosnian scenario for a dutch company who had just been warned off for duty 
 their final task was a heliborne coup de main attack on a bridge held by 1 li the rest of 
 the battalion managed to get air experience with a battalion attack involving a move by chinooks the last four days 
 were spent on the kent coast using the excellent counter insurgency ranges at the cinque ports training area recruiting has 
 been a high priority this year and the battalion strength has risen from 80 to 97 of established strength in

 they certainly saw some national variety since annual camp in july training has included a major commitment in running an 
 exercise executive stretch in september assisted by 2 wessex this involved 90 young executives being put through a weekend of 
 military orientated activities in order to promote awareness of the value of the ta it also provided an excellent training 
 opportunity for the qm s department with a great variety of logistic and catering demands 0:de 0:mands battalion saam was 
 held in conjunction with 4 rgj at pirbright in october where hq company were champion company and rfn howse hq 
 was champion shot at the end of the month the recce platoon achieved a certificate of merit in the cambrian 
 patrol competition which was a creditable result on the sporting front the battalion has been busy with the football team 
 winning the south district ta competition in february and then only being beaten by the royal irish in ballymena in 
 the ta national semi final the officers sailing team came 3rd in the light division regatta in june and the 
 officers even managed a 2 2 draw in football against the serjeant s mess only to lose on penalties on 
 the social and ceremonial side the highlight in the first part of the year was 5 rgj s waterloo band 
 and bugles playing in the light division s excellent sounding of retreat on horse guards in june the ta bandsmen 
 and women joined all other divisional ta and regular bands to form 267 musicians and 111 buglers who were watched 
 with great appreciation by everyone 0:every 0:one from princess alexandra to the local central tv news the battalion has also 
 maintained its links with the worshipful company of furniture makers and provided honour guards for their two annual dinners the 
 officers mess held a very successful annual dinner at trinity college in june on a beautiful summer evening with lord 
 carrington as the guest speaker in september local friends of 5 rgj were entertained at a combined officers and sncos 
 messes sounding of retreat and cocktail party held at slade park barracks this was also the occasion for the retirement 
 as honorary colonel of lieutenant general sir peter hudson kcb cbe dl who has served as an extremely supportive honorary 
 colonel since the battalion s formation in december 1986 he has now been succeeded by professor r jr j o 
 neill ao ma who is currently the chicele professor of the history of war at oxford university colonel o neill 
 s early posts are in australia with the melbourne university regiment 5 rgj approaches the end of 1993 in good 
 heart and the first training events in 1994 will be two cos assessment weekends to confirm the success of training 
 in 1993 in the background there is concern over the future of the ta but the sth battalion remains well 
 recaiited well motivated and optimistic 0:opti 0:mistic for the future green jackets and patricia s a healthy exchange continues by 
 captain c v sattler after three years of requesting the green jackets as my number one posting preference a new 
 adventure has begun here in dover england i have been with the second battalion the royal green jackets 2 rgj 
 for five months now and find that i am quite settled in all my expectations have been met ten fold 
 and there is still so much to do my experience with 2 rgj has found it s operation remarkably 0:remark 
 0:ably similar to a canadian infantry battalion thank god it makes things much easier however there is a fair amount 
 of conversion training that is required in the first weeks my first capt c v sattler and maj h emck 
 16 dec 93 at connaugbt barracks dover kent england 
 105 the patrician 1993 official duty entailed leading c company on parade marching at 140 paces per minute i had 
 enough trouble with our own heavy drill perhaps the hardest transition is learning to speak english again the list is 
 exhaustive of words that do not necessarily mean what you want them to imagine going on exercise you pack your 
 jumper sweater in your bergan along with your basher hootchy and water proof rain gear you drive around in your 
 wagon jeep of course everybody brings their swords bayonets you dismount and tab march with the blokes guys same job 
 different scenery wank durch the battalion is no less busy than your own canadian experience like our own army the 
 brits are undergoing a down scaling of forces frp as we know it a little history the third battalion was 
 disbanded in june 1992 leaving the first in cyprus and the second here in dover it is probable safe to 
 say that the sentiment is two battalions are now doing the work of three you may know this feeling sooner 
 than you like too 2 rgj s role is with the amf l the focus of our training has been 
 for cold climate operations we have already done training exercises in denmark the snowdon mountains in wales and we are 
 off to norway for three months in january 1994 many of the soldiers here have had limited snow experiences training 
 soldiers to have a common snow sense is something we take for granted as canadians the highlight of the next 
 year includes amf l training and a visit by the colonel in chief her majesty the queen tentatively scheduled to 
 come in october 94 it was nice to see twelve patricia s from the third battalion visit us in october 
 93 on their way to the cambrian patrol competition in brecon patricia s really do have a home here with 
 the green jackets since being with 2 rgj i have been oc c company for four months and currently i 
 am commanding support company regimental history allied regiment in 1924 authority was given for the alliance of princess patricia s 
 canadian light infantry with the rifle brigade common associations in this case were many the duke of connaught formerly a 
 rifle brigade officer who had served in canada was canada s governor general from 1912 to 1916 he was colonel 
 in chief of the rifle brigade for sixty years his youngest daughter princess patricia had given her name to the 
 regiment the regiment s first adjutant was a rifle brigade officer the regiment fought for twelve months during world war 
 l shoulder to shoulder with the rifle brigade these very strong bonds of family interests led to the alliance between 
 the regiment and the rifle brigade the rifle brigade was formed in 1800 the regiment has a distinguished record of 
 active service including copenhagen the peninsular war waterloo the crimea south africa world war i and 11 it was garrisoned 
 in canada at fort henry from 1847 to 1849 and from 1850 to 1852 as a result of the british 
 army cuts in strength and changes in establishments the rifle brigade has been brigaded with the king s royal rifle 
 corps and the oxfordshire and buckinghamshire 0:buckingham 0:shire light infantry 43rd and 52nd the official designations for the battalions are 
 ist royal green jackets 43rd and 52nd 2nd royal green jackets king s royal rifle corps 3rd royal green jackets 
 the rifle brigade extract from second battle of ypres diary well it might for even those men of the rifle 
 brigade who were laden with ammunition boxes carried half a dozen bandoliers of cartridges as well above all they brought 
 machine guns on the bth of may said a wounded ppcli sergeant in a speech at shorncliffe on the first 
 birthday of the regiment we saw the angels and they wore the letters r b on their shoulders and the 
 biggest of the angels were those who bore the machine guns on their shoulders too
