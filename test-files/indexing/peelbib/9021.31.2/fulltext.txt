 of attitude on the part of the regimented by the camp commanders 2 condiprovince towards those forced to live on
 relief tions varied within the provincial camps just as they hoped that social credit relief policies they did in the
 federal camps but the universal would differ from those followed by the complaint was that because the men in the
 camps discredited united farmers of alberta received a starvation wage they would leave the administration camps as poor as when
 they arrived in addition the ufa had attempted within the limits of some camps were judged by observers as overcrowded
 and lacking in basic sanitary facilities 3 the province s finances to aid municipa lities with the increased relief burden

 vouchers other would insure that relief families had a nutritious party leaders promised more changes commendiet despite their meagre earnings
 and that relief ting on the regina riot of 1935 which occurred was not used to purchase unnecessary items 4

 its relief policies in who are guilty of petty persecution and lack of courtesy to the public several important respects
 first it was argued that the personnel of the relief department and lack of courtesy on the part of relief
 departparticularly the chairman of the provincial relief ment officials was a common complaint of social commission a a mackenzie were
 ufa credit gr oups calling for the dismissal of holdovers who ought to be fired in favour of peo mackenzie
 and other department officials the ple more kindly disposed both to the unemployed king edward social credit group in edmonton
 and to social credit theories secondly it was claimed that the attitudes of provincial relief ofargued that more money could

 not alone in believ with social credit clubs and unemployed groups ing that the replacement of mackenzie by a social

 these officials could unemployed the provincial unemployed mar not have been respect for the nonpartisanship of r ied men s
 association which had led several the civil service the social credit government effective relief strikes in edmonton and calgary sacked
 many civil servants whom it regarded as expressed this belief most strongly in a letter to hostile to social credit
 theories and replaced them all social credit mlas with party activists aberhartbelievedthatpar had you been a candidate in a time
 of prosperity tisanship should play a role not only in the hirwould you have been elected it was the unemployed
 ing of top officials but even in the hiring of the farmers on relief those crushed by debt those labourers
 stenographers and truckers 23 clearly on starvation wages those who had sympathy for the mackenzie and his associates were retained
 unfortunate who elected you because the government was won over to their the department of government that comes in closest
 views the social credit board wrote to the parcontact with those who are unfortunate is the department of relief the
 commissioner of relief should be ty ‘ s mlas rather than condemn the minister carefully chosen by your party and
 he should be a and the officials of the department we should member of your party marvel at the efficiency
 with which they handle the present commissioner of relief was appointed relief with the all too inadequate supply of money
 by the former ufa government he is undul harsh at their disposal and arbitrary as long as he remains in
 charge of relief your government stands undermined in the eyes mackenzie s influence on the government was of the unemployed
 certainly a conservative one in a letter to the man you appoint might not be able to relieve the minister
 of health and relief dr w w cross suffering of those on provincial reliefi that must be for example mackenzie
 persuaded the governdone by you as legislators but he will have the confidence of the unemployed they can trust him
 ment not to close the soup kitchens for the single because as a loyal social crediter he will have their
 unemployed the letter demonstr ates an attitude welfare in his heart 2 that corroborates the views of the unemployed aberhart
 did not dismiss mackenzie and other organizations and of many social credit groups leading officials of the relief department indeed
 that the relief commissioner was an impediment he and his ministers would not engage in debate to the liberalization of
 relief policies unemployed men were put to work on railway maintenance such as this group near pincher station in 1932
 responding to cross s request for his views farmers answering a letter from a single on the demand from calgary
 unemployed groups unemployed edmonton social crediter who opthat single homeless men receive negotiable food posed the farm scheme aberhart chided
 vouchers and that the soup kitchens be closed i sometimes wonder if the single unemployed men in down mackenzie said
 this is a matter of the cities do not forget that there are many families policy and i would be
 glad to have the govern in the outlying districts of the province who are sufment s direction but then he
 added fering greater privations than they we would be very happy to give the unemployed men in the cities bet
 i would point out however that during our recent ter treatment but this cannot be done at the expense visit
 to calgary when you changed the policy in of the welfare of those who are in need in other parts
 respect to returned men that 112 new applicants ap of the province plied for relief under the new policy who
 would not two years later the unemployed were just as accept relief in the dining hall this would indicate that
 they managed to exist without relief but are quite unhappy with government relief policies and prepared to accept cash and
 we had no evidence that aberhart was just as belligerent in the governthese men were not entitled to relief but
 were aware ment s defence the government announced cuts that they had existed previously and made no in the provincial
 contribution to relief and a storm complaints of criticism from social credit groups in the cities the additional cost of
 a negotiable voucher over predictably followed feeding in the dining halls is n excess of 1300 per month one study
 group noted that people were still if a negotiable voucher was issued to all single men waiting for the government
 to take steps towards they would immediately flock here from all parts of lowering the cost of living and that
 the group canada are strongly opposed to any reduction in the the soup kitchens in fact were not closed relief
 grant on the part of the provincial down nor were other significant changes in government 3 aberhart responded by calling
 relief policy made indeed the government the letter an uncalled for insult and added following the lead of the relief
 department the group who could pass such a resolution i am abandoned its early notions that the unemployed satisfied has
 not the best interests of social credit must be given more purchasing power to at heart or the are not
 keeping in touch with what stimulate the economy instead it attempted to is being done it is just that type
 of letter we receive reduce relief costs as much as possible by remov from our bitterest opposition and i would
 like to tell the west end social credit group of calgary that ing as many people as possible from the
 relief i have no time to read any flirt her such letters from rolls in an attempt both to cut
 relief expenditures it and appeal to rural voters the government in october 1937 announced that farmers could hire but much
 of the social credit league membersingle reliefers for 5 00 per month the same ship in the province felt that
 the government s rate paid in the stigmatized relief camps a handling of the relief situation was inadequate reliefer would
 be assigned to a farmer and if he the provincial convention of the social credit refused to accept the job
 he would be cut off league in 1938 passed a resolution calling for the relief rolls 26 direct relief for
 the single unemployed as opposed to soup kitchens and non negotiable bed tickets the farm relief scheme was opposed by
 the the resolution sponsored by the calgary and edorganizations of the unemployed and by the trade monton constituencies claimed that
 the condiunions the calgar y trades and labour con tions under which the single unemployed lived gress called for generous
 cash relief for the had become worse than they ever were and are unemployed until work at trade union rates
 of gradually getting worse 33 it also noted that pay and conditions is provided 27 and over 300 saskatchewan and
 british columbia which young men demonstrated their opposition while have the same quota of men on relief as tnis their
 representatives attempted unsuccessfully to province paid direct relief convince the government to reverse itself on the farm relief scheme many
 of the men had been the aberhart administration s unwillingness to break with the policies of its predecessor or to
 cut off relief for refusing to go to farms and 13 were arrested during the demonstration 28 remove the key
 relief officials led eventually to defections from the party and to divisions be aberhart rejected the claims of the unemployed

 families from the relief pulsion and using them as cheap labour for rolls in lethbridge in 1937 contributed to a

 this time as it is unjust and unfair besides just as relief officials influenced the governcreating much hardship and ill

 of a thousand suns by fred a burfield as told to stanley burfield it was my turn to do the
 chores that morning but row of sundogs penetrating each one and join i didn t mind because even though i
 was only ing them all together it was so intense that it ap 13 i didn t have to get
 up particularly early to peared almost like a solid highly polished steel do them it was deep in the winter
 of 1920 on bar but it also seemed to be alive it slowly a homestead 35 miles south of hanna
 all i had lengthened in both directions moving out from to do was feed and water a few cows other
 than the last pair of sundogs until a new pair formed that we were just putting in time waiting for
 ahead of it one at each end to be pierced by spring so about 10 o clock i threw on
 my coat the bar in turn but instead of dying these new and stepped out of our sod house into
 the cold sundogs would immediately flare up and become it was 35 below zero fahrenheit and the air was as
 bright as the others almost totally still the sun was just rising above i hurried to finish my chores and
 ran to the the low haze of ice crystals in the southeast it house by then a second and third
 layer had formwas accompanied by the usual pair of nearly ed in the southern sky each sundog joined to the
 duplicate sundogs one on either side of the sun ones above and below it by a vertical bar of light
 tiny flashes of light sparkled about me as walk i put my head in the door and yelled come ed
 to the sod barn these were not particularly out and look at the sundogs unusual either although they seemed brighter
 than normal then a layer of white crystals began but it was nice and warm inside and no one to
 settle on my shoulders i stopped to watch one stirred dad and mother were reading magazines on the blue sleeve
 of my coat it was a very thin my elder brother robin was caught up in a flat disc shiny
 like a mirror with no visible per book and peter six years my junior was busy forations and about the
 size of the head of a drawing shingle nail unusually large the crystals were it s really something i urged
 come on so light that they hung suspended in the cold air and see it and every second or so
 one would catch the sun little peter got up and scratched a hole in the and make a bright flash
 we called them thick frost on the front window then abandoned ‘ sparkles it and opened the door a crack
 to peek out he the cattle were huddled around the barn for could see only the sky to the south
 and was overwarmth i took them down to the well and baled whelmed say he shouted the whole sky out
 some water with a pail and a slipper y ice is covered with sundogs covered rope but they were too
 cold to drink so robin took his turn at the door gosh much the sun had risen a bit more
 and now had he said clearly excited two sundogs on either side of it that was not uncommon in the
 prairie winters we occasional our parents finally came to see what all the ly saw as many as four on
 either side nine in fuss was about the strange sight made mother all including the real sun but as i
 went about nervous what s happening she asked lookmy chores carrying straw and hay to the cows ing to dad
 for comfort and yearlings the sundogs began multiplying faster and faster as the sun cleared the haze and i fred
 burfield came from england in 191010 farm near i became brighter i kept turning my eyes back to i hanna
 and later at smith munson and ponoka i the sky in mounting excitement i registered as blind since 1946 he
 is now retired in i calgary his son stanley is a journalist and i then something happened that i had
 never seen i freelancer in calgary before a shaft of bright light moved along the 33 the mailman seen here
 at the burfield farm was one of the many people who sasm the strange phenomenon of the sun dogs in
 1920 dad took one quick look and returned to his around the horizon something i assumed was imchair shaking his
 head possible i stood there amazed they were not mother became irritated do keep the door only still moving around
 forming at the same shut she said it s getting cold in here pace as before but they were still
 building upwards as more and more layers formed and but i was more curious than ever i went out spread
 out the highest ones were nearly for another look not taking the time to put my overhead i had to
 crane my head back to see coat back on after warming up the whole them i was flabbergasted how could
 they do southern sky was now filled with sundogs all it how could they keep this perfect symmetry joined together
 by shining bars of light it was every sundog in its allotted place just so and impossible to say which
 was the real sun but it nowhere else i heard peter counting out loud was no doubt contained in the
 row of artificial he got up to 35 when the cold became too much suns that had encircled the sky
 the furthest this for us and we had to go in besides they were initial bar of light was creeping
 onwards fast forming at such a rate now on so many levels enough that i could actually see its movement
 that counting them seemed hopeless and sundog after sundog was forming ahead of this time i put on my cap
 and coat and mitts it a new one every one to three minutes at first determined to stay out until
 the sundogs had faint then brightening as the bar passed through either stopped multiplying or had filled up the it
 also since i had first noticed the sundogs the sun had risen somewhat in the late morning sky but they
 certainly didn t look like they were about to stop the longest line had moved all the sky lifting its
 long row of sundogs with it as well as the rows above it the empty space way around into the
 north west at one end and the north east at the other the southern sky was beneath had then been
 filled in with several new now ablaze with suns all equally bright they rows culminated in a circle of light
 directly overhead in my shirt sleeves i quickly got too cold to as near to being a halo as one
 could wish it was stand around outside and went in to hover over formed by the highest circle of sundogs
 four of our little kitchen range shivering but i was soon them in all with their horizontal bars joined inout
 the door again peter on my tail this time to a halo it was all the more astonishing because anxious
 to see if the sundogs could go all the way of its colour it wasn t metallic white like the
 34 other bars of light but was coloured much like from hanna he had seen the sundogs there and a
 rainbow except that it was much narrower as he said goodbye he solemnly shook hands also ‘ vertical bars joined
 each of these four with all of us saying we may never see each sundogs to the one opposite forming
 a bright other again folks you saw those lights yesterwhite cross in the middle of the multi coloured day it
 can only mean the end of the world halo i had been waiting in expectation of this dan mcgibbon one
 of our neighbors came highest circle of sundogs but when it actually over soon after to see if there was
 any mail for formed its religious symbolism surprised me him he was a bachelor like most of the ironically mother
 the only devout christian in homesteaders at the time and came on foot i our family missed seeing it completely
 to me knew him well enough to talk to him so i asked however it was beautiful beyond description if
 he had seen the sundogs yes i did see a and eerie as well few lights was all he would
 say he was busy as i stood there in awe the last gaps in the reading his paper when i
 asked some of the curtain of sundogs off in the northern sky were others who came in later i got
 pretty much the filled in these suns weren t as bright as were same response they just passed it off
 even in those in the south but nevertheless they were their conversations amongst themselves sitting clearly visible i finally looked
 down at the prairie around our kitchen after having looked at their around me a strange and eerie light covered
 the mail they never mentioned the sundogs this land an orangey light that cast no shadows i was difficult for
 me to understand because litwalked around to the north side of the house and tie else of any note ever
 happened on the prairie it was just as brightly lit as was the south in ef certainly little that could
 get one as excited as fect the sundogs were suns in their own right this had me i supposed that
 most people must either not have seen them winter being a time the last one formed at about noon and
 the whole strange spectacle remained intact for of little outdoor activity or they were not interested another two hours then
 as if it were a gigantic stage play and the final act had drawn to a close many years later
 i wrote a brief description a cold breeze sprang up from the north west of the spectacle for a number
 of weekly sweeping the sundogs away they disappeared newspapers in alberta and saskatchewan i first in the north then overhead

 polict were preparing their recommendations on new regulations first as to spawning i have never been rightly dle of june
 the trout run up the small tributaries able to determine when the speckled trout spawn in large numbers they not
 being muddy like the i have caught them early in july when the spawn main streams then the trout are
 slaughtered by would run out of them freely on their betng means of fish traps and nets and large numbers
 handled and i have found them full of spawn are sent to market for sale large streams as these until
 the rivers close i had a record kept by are in this district they cannot long stand the detachment at
 pekisko highwood river of fish drain of illegal fishing and the streams are so caught during the winter for food
 through the ice depopulated now that they would be all the betand over half of those caught had either milt
 or ter for artificial stocking spawn in them it requires this fact to be ascertained as speedily as possible and
 a close time the universal complaint now is the scarcity of appointed no special statute or ordinance has big fish
 of course in some parts of the streams been passed for protection of the fish of the not easily accessible
 the trout are plenty and north west and the fish have suffered in the past both authors were officers in
 the nwmp this and are still suffering greatly from the want of document oilsits mclllree s report on maple creek
 proper protection and authorized officials to his is dated july 29 1890 and while fraser oct enforce the laws for
 such protection 12 1890 both are in the rcmp records rg l 8 vol 44 file 814 in the public
 archives of canada when the rivers rise generally about the mid 36 large but it will not last long in
 devil s lake minnewanka but know they exist in many other lakes the trout fishing is one of the chief
 attractions in this district both to residents and visitors in there are several lakes within easy distance of a new
 country every natural attraction should be morley that have these fish in them but the inmade the most of to
 induce residents to remain dians describe them as hard to catch not having in and visitors to visit and bring
 money into the found the right kind of line for them countr y there are several lakes at the head
 of the i should recommend most strongly that kananaskis river which teem with these fish in stringent laws be passed
 regarding the preserva devil s lake the most accessible fishing ground tion and capture of fish especially on these for
 these trout they are mostly caught with a points a sufficient close time every year fish troll the smaller fish
 up to six or seven pounds to be caught only with a hook and line standard appear to live on
 a kind of worm found in the of size of fish to be caught heavy penalties to mud and on
 a calm day the trout can be seen be enforced for using fish traps nets or other il rooting in
 the mud like pigs after attaining a legal instruments and regulations as to the sale larger size they appear to
 live on each other of trout saw mills along the banks of any trout these fish begin to bite as
 soon as the lake is streams required to be forced to burn their saw clear of ice in the spring
 and disappear about the dust and other mill refuse and not throw it in the middle of august when they
 are full of spawn river there is a saw mill at kananaskis on the fortunately their spawning ground has not
 yet bow river a number of trout were picked up been found they do not appear to bite in winter
 dead about morley in may and june last in every as they have been fished for through the ice case
 a quantity of saw dust was found in the gills without success i think a close season for these and
 insides of the dead fish i am not prepared fish should embrace from 1 st september to 1 st positively
 to state that the saw dust killed those august and no nets be allowed to be used or set fish
 but i think from what i have read of the lines with more than one hook on it and no
 saw dust matter that these fish would have been spearing at any time still alive if there had not been
 a saw mill at these lakes appear to contain no other fish but kananaskis the lake trout with the exception
 of small fish of if drains are built in any river or tributary the minnow and chub families there are
 no suitable fish passes should be provided i should white fish as far as i am aware in this district
 strongly advise that an energetic experienced man pincher creek district be appointed at an early date as a fish warden
 and that hatcheries be established at different the running water so far down as it remains points in the district
 for the purpose of restoring clear and free from mud contains speckled trout the rivers other species of trout from
 the east bull trout grayling and suckers where it begins might be introduced and tried in the western to be
 muddy i believe pike gold eyes and streams there is a fish in these streams com suckers are the only
 inhabitants monly called grayling but which bears not the the lakes contain speckled salmon bull trout faintest resemblance to that
 fish it is of some and white fish species of chub rises fairly to the fly and is a good
 table fish speckled trout the exact species of this particular kind is difficult to determine they are fish other than
 trout found in these mountain characterized by black and brown spots only of rivers are few pike come up bow
 river as far irregular size and disposition i have not noticed as mouth of elbow but not in any large
 numbers any pink spots on these fish the special mark they come up highwood river about as far as is
 a red patch on each side of the throat where the crossing of the macleod trail they are a fish
 it joins the mouth and in the fish of 12 ½ lbs not to be encouraged in a trout stream
 there are and upwards a reddish tint a long the belly i have a few catfish in these streams and
 a few sturgeon never seen the red marks on the throat on any come up until the water gets too
 rapid for them highland or other trout in nearly every lake in the mountains is to be the general opinion
 appears to be that they found the big lake trout running up to forty or spawn in the streams during
 may or june after fifty pounds i have only experience with them the ice is all out and water warmer
 and before the 37 snows are melted in the mountains sufficiently to the prevailing tint of the skin which resembles
 cause high water in july that of a pike is thrush grey in fact their col in the lakes i
 am led to believe by statements ouring is very similar to that of a pike and they that they spawn
 during end of august greatly resemble that fish in shape i cannot throw any light on the spawning pecularities september
 one informant assures me he has watched the male and female first close together grayling inhabit running water only as
 a rule in august and has caught them at that season they are generally to be found in shallow rapid
 the female with spawn the male with milt running places and owing to their shyness and small mouths are difficult
 to catch and not killed it is however hardly credible that spawning occurs twice a year and i incline to
 this opinion in any quantity i cannot give any information that may and june are the probable months dur about
 their spawning but should think april or may to be about the time ing which spawning takes place in the
 running water in the lakes it appears that they spawn dur suckers are not worth eating any way ing the
 early fall fish have been caught in whitefish only are caught in nets they have september evidently spent and this
 year in a been taken out of the lakes here but in very small sma ll stream running into the
 lower crow nest quantities lake 15 or 16 large cock fish were shot in the shallow water devoid of milt
 they were cer regarding better preservation of the fish here tainly cock fish which are distinguished by their the fisheries
 act sec 9 para d makes close beaks and lower jaw ver y very pointed and time for trout 1
 st october lst january i think upturned it should be 1 st october lst july or 1 st may lst
 september during may or june the rivers would i have killed small trout in beaver creek in the be protected
 and generally the fish do not take porcupines weighing say i to ½ lb in january bait of any kind
 till july or august nature puts with spawn obstacles in the way herself in august in the river connecting kootenay
 nets of any kind in this district should be pro lakes i have caught them with spawn which hibited except
 for personal supply as the excuse was evidently not quite completed people give is that they are netting for whitefish
 salmon trout and bull trout i take to be the of course trout are caught and as an officer same
 species known under either name these cannot always be present are killed are ugly brutes huge heads and mouth furnished
 i would recommend that any use of a net exwith large strong cat like teeth they are very voracious which
 leads me to consider them the cept naturally a landing net be prohibited some proviso also regarding waste of fish
 would be a same as the salmon which inhabits the large good thing parties are in the habit of going
 scotch lochs fishing catching quantities and chucking them they have long lanky bodies with faint pink away because they cannot
 eat them spots they have a dark line down the side and prairie fires during the past week the sky
 has been darkened almost every day by the smoke arising from prairie fires and a great deal of damage has
 been done by destroying the winter ranges in this western country where the stock feed out all winter no one
 can estimate the loss entailed by a prairie fire the law is very strict in dealing with anyone convicted of
 letting a fire escape and ever yone should make it his business to assist in every way possible to bring
 the offenders to justice on saturday by the hardest work imaginable the settlers north of the bow saved their haystacks
 and dwellings some of the townspeople turned out to help them and sandy macdonald was noticed returning with his hair
 and whiskers badly singed if they would now turn their attention to discovering who let the fire run away and
 have him severely punished they would be doing the public a great service calgar y tribune oct 7 1885 38
