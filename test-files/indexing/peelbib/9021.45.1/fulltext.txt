 a dempsey in 1953 1 was working in my office at the publicity bureau of the alberta government when my
 director called me into his office he introduced me to an engineer named jim mcgregor and said we were going
 to help his society publish a quarterly journal the government had agreed to mimeograph collate and bind four hundred copies
 free of charge and so began the alberta historical review later renamed alberia histor when the first issue appeared later
 in 1953 it was the culmination of half a century of dedicated work by a handful of people to preserve
 this province s history and in order to place the beginning of the magazine in its proper context the earlier
 story must be told the impetus for a group to preserve alberta s history occurred less than two years after
 the province was formed it began when a group of interested edmontonians and politicians met on february 25 1907 to
 draft a constitution as a result the alberta legislature passed the historical society of alberta act three weeks later on
 march 15 leading the drive was alexander c rutherford premier of alberta he was not just a figurehead for he
 remained actively involved with the 90 th anniversary 1907 1997 historical society of alberta as the society enters its ninetieth
 year of existence we are pleased to offer occasional articles in this and forthcoming issues on aspects of historical preservation
 in alberta this magazine has been in existence for forty four years and grew out of the need to preserve
 information which the society had gathered over the years beginning with a nucleus in edmonton the society gradually expanded with
 chapters in lethb ridge calgary and red deer and strong support from the medicine hat and peace river areas the
 society wishes to pay proper homage to those who helped create and maintain the organization over most of this century
 above members ofaiherta ‘ sfirst legislature seen here in 1906 joined with a number of interested edinontonians toforni the historical

 work eventually politics brought him back to edmonton in 1914 c a i where he became a lecturer at the
 from 1907 to 1919 no minute book was university of alberta then a year later kept and it is quite
 likely that no he settled into a permanent position as meetings were held during that time history teacher at strathcona
 high then in 1919 a man appeared on the school in edmonton and remained there years he was w everard
 edmonds during these years edmonds always scene who would influence the until he retired in 1942 organization for the next
 thirty five author school teacher and anglican had a keen interest in history and minister born in norwich ontario iii
 writing over the years he was the 4 1 b e i 875 he obtained his teaching author of four

 a short distance edmonton he also contributed east of waterton park a year later he numerous articles to the edmonton
 became principal of the cardston school journal and to british american and but was lured away by stories of the
 canadian periodicals by the time he klondike gold rush he got as far as discovered the moribund historical snows so
 he turned south to california already widely known throughout the edmonton but was stopped by heavy society of alberta in
 1919 he was to complete his education when he west while his name is familiar to returned to alberta he
 became eastern readers as a frequent contributor headmaster of emmanuel college to canadian periodicals of the highest edmonton and later
 taught at an indian class 4 1 b e residential school at this point he decided to enter the ministry
 and after an energetic organizer edmonds set to obtaining a theological degree in work to make the historical society an
 winnipeg lie had various postings active part of the edmonton community including being rector of st john s through his
 urging a reorganization church in saskatoon church work in meeting was held early in 1919 at england and rector of

 journalist for canada magazine of become province wide aniong the alberta history winter 1997 leading the drive was alexander c
 rutherford premier of alberta he was not just a figurehead for he remained actively involved with the organization long after
 he had left politics over the next few years after 1919 the society met once or twice annually to conduct
 business and hear speakers some of the prominent names in alberta history who addressed the group during the period from
 1 920 s to the i 940 s were pioneer minister rev do mcqueen fur trader and businessman john a
 mcdougall hon frank oliver major general wa griesbach historian frank gilbert roe professor lewis g thomas chief justice horace harvey
 and senator wa buchanan a particularly interesting comment was made by frank oliver in his 1919 address that the society
 might well devote a part of its activities to recording present facts which would some day be of real historic
 value it was a good idea but it didn t happen during this time the society undertook a few specific
 projects probably the most successful was its effort to have several sites marked by cairns or monuments in 1925 the
 society asked the federal government to place niarkers at the sites of treaty no seven alberta s first coal mine
 old bow fort and rocky mountain house later they added the battle of frenchman s butte the north west field
 force fort assinihoine and fort dunvegan to their list ultimately most of these sites were above premier alexander c rutherfbrd
 is seemi here in 907 the year he helped form the historical society of alberta alberta history winter 1997 other
 recommendations were the reconstruction of fort edmonton publishing documents collecting records of pioneers building a museum and establishing a provincial
 archives at an annual meeting held a month later the society elected rutherford as president and edmonds as secretary the
 university was well represented on the executive with broadus as a vicepresident and m h long as treasurer then after
 an active year in which several meetings were held edmonds outlined to the 1920 annual meeting his views for the
 future he said our chief aim during the past twelve months has been to call attention to the need of
 such a society as this and to make known to some extent the wealth of material lying all about us
 this two fold object has i think been fully attained more important is the question what shall be done in
 the months to come in my own humble opinion our chief effort should be directed toward the establishment of a
 museum for the housing of historical records edmonds went on to state that the society should have branches in the
 leading centres of alberta each of these being affiliated with the parent society he added that papers after being prepared
 and read by the various branches could be forwarded to the general secretary to be placed in the society s
 archives from time to time these papers might be published in pamphlet or booklet form and thus become easily accessible
 to the general public of course edmonds was correct in everything he said but most of his ideas did not
 reach fruition for another thirtyfive years the same was true for suggestions for the reconstruction of fort edmonton and the
 establishment of a provincial museum and a provincial archives formed to produce books for alberta the owner w c richards
 learned that a local engineer james 0 macgregor had written a book on early fur traders but had been unable
 to get it published although it was a departure from his usual books he decided to publish this work one
 of the first ever written about alberta by an alberta author and produced in the province by a commercial publisher
 it was entitled blankets and beads and was released in 1949 because of the publicity surrounding his book macgregor was
 invited to speak at the historical society s first meeting in 1950 his topic was early routes into the peace
 river country this meeting ultimately had a significant impact upon the society impressed with the dynamic fifty year old engineer
 the officers of the society immediately asked him to join the group and at their 1950 annual meeting he was
 elected to the executive that year also was a landmark for w everard edinonds for he was elected president of
 the society for the first time in his long association with the organization jim macgregor was born in scotland in
 1905 and came to alberta as a child he attended rural schools north west of edmonton and in 1929 he
 obtained his degree in engineering from the university of alberta he worked for canadian utilities for twenty one years rising
 to the position of general manager and retiring the same year that he joined the society two years later he
 was appointed chairman of the alberta power commission 4 macgregor threw himself wholeheartedly into the work of the society taking
 on such programs as encouraging women s institutes across alberta to write their local histories and urging the alberta government
 to erect highway signs at historic sites similar to the ones used in montana both of these projects were highly
 successful macgregor rapidly became such a driving force in marked some due directly to the work of the society at
 the local level attempts were made to mark edmonton s first school the edmonton bulletin office and the fort edmonton
 cemetery much of the success of the project was due to the work of prof m h long who headed
 up the society s historic sites committee and ultimately was appointed alberta s representative to the historic sites monuments board
 of canada meetings of the society were suspended in 1939 at the outbreak of world war two until that time
 ex premier rutherford had continued to be an active president while ednionds was the ever reliable secretary when meetings resumed
 in 1947 rutherford had passed away and the presidency was taken by col f c jamieson a longtime member edmonds
 remained as secretary and professor long as treasurer the post war era saw many changes taking place in the canadian
 west the rapid growth of edmonton and calgary modern highways oil development and other factors were changing the face of
 the province in earlier years most school books had been published in toronto but in the 1940 s an edmonton

 people in our history we are very fortunate to have you as editor 7 when he took office macgregor noted
 that most of the others on the executive at an executive meeting of the society were well beyond retirement age
 who held in january 1953 it was moved by while having devoted many years to the j w sherwin seconded
 by prof m h society were not prepared to launch long that the proposed quarterly be aggressive new programs accordingly
 called ‘ the alberta historical review with their encouragement he set out to recruit younger new members who could this
 is where 1 came into the story a provide the type of leadership he year earlier as a writer for
 the publicity needed one of the first was bruce peel bureau i had produced the booklet librarian at the university
 of alberta entitled historic sites of alberta so i who was invited as a guest speaker and was designated the
 liaison person in soon found himself on the executive he seeing the magazine into print for the later became president
 of the society first issue the society decided to and was a major factor in its success produce seven hundred
 copies of which others were dr w c whiteside who four hundred would be paid for by the became vice
 president and mrs ce government this first issue released in learmonth a member of the executive april 1953 was mimeographed

 given at society the continuity of the organization meetings and contained a brief history of the organization copies were sent
 to the shortly after his election macgregor ninety one members of the society wrote to several local historians while others
 were widely circulated to throughout the province stating that it libraries newspapers and interested has occurred to me that we
 might be able persons throughout the province to start publication of a monthly or quarterly bulletin devoted to alberta this
 first issue surpassed all history what would you think of such expectations shortly after it was an effort 7 encouraged
 by the response released macgregor wrote to the editor he asked edmonds to be the editor then the reception given
 the review has contacted ralph r moore deputy been most gratifying mr george the minister of economic affairs for the
 treasurerl advised that we have received alberta government asking for 130 new subscriptions and he has sent assistance in launching
 the new me dozens of complimentary letters publication a few days later he wrote to which he has received 8
 this more than edmonds doubled the previous membership and there was no sign of a letup as a result as
 i told you over the phone the other the first printing was soon gone and it day mr moore very
 kindly promised was necessary to reprint another that his department would attend to hundred copies and to order 500 copies
 the typing and printing of our of the number two historical society quarterly and that they would supply the envelopes
 we the second number followed in july at will have to do our own mailing but which time macgregor editorialized
 to that does not seem to me to be too members we think that the review much of a task
 i suggested to mr will be the means of banding together all moore that we would like 400 copies those
 who think as we do that more per issue i feel we can do a good job should be done
 to preserve our history ‘ b 4 e a the first issue released in april 1953 was mimeographed thirty five
 pages long on legalsized paper and included four lectures which had been given at society meetings above the design of
 the society s magazine changed in 1954 after complaints from librarians about its awkward size nalberta history winter 1997 once
 we are all working together we believe we can accomplish much more than we have been able to do in
 the past by the time the third number was released in november librarians were complaining about the awkward size of
 the publication so beginning in 1954 it was changed to an 8 x 10 inch format fairly quickly edmonds and
 i slipped into a routine he gathered the articles mostly papers given at earlier meetings and carefully prepared everything else
 in handwritten form he did not use a typewriter he then delivered to me at the publicity bureau a bundle
 containing the articles and news of society happenings i had this typed by one of the secretaries and delivered it
 to a company which printed and bound the copies when i received the invoice i deducted the cost for the
 first four hundred later increased to five hundred and sent an invoice to the historical society for the remainder both
 of us also began contributing articles to the magazine he started with establishment of the north west mounted police in
 northern alberta in 1954 and f w g haultain premier of the north west territories in 1957 meanwhile 1 wrote
 story of the blood reserve in 1953 and fort ostell and the rid rebellion in 1954 like bruce peel i
 soon found myself recruited into the society by jim macgregor at the annual meeting in february 1954 1 was elected
 to the executive committee before i had even become a member my task besides working with edmonds on the editorial
 side was to arrange for newsstand sales of the magazine all across alberta at its peak we were selling more
 than a hundred copies through the news outlets a year later when looking at the invoices i realized that we
 were paying a lot of money because of the amount of paper we were using in the cumbersome magazine on
 a hunch 1 checked with sonic friends at douglas printers and learned that we could get a professionally printed glossy
 illustrated magazine 7 x 10 inches for approximately the same price we were paying for the mimeographed ones a quick
 change was made and everyone was happy we now had a format which was kept for the next thirty seven
 years changing the name to alberta history in 1975 and switching in 1992 to the format and size used today
 in 1956 1 became associate editor of the magazine the same year that i moved from edmonton to the new
 glenbow foundation in calgary edmonds and i continued to work together at a distance but two years later he was
 obliged to resign because of ill health as it happened i had just been elected president of the society but
 after only one meeting i had to resign in order to take on the editorship edmonds continued to support the
 society serving on its editorial board until his death in 1966 at the age of above when james g macgregor
 became president of the historical society in 1952 one of his first actions was to arrange fbr a quarterly magazine
 alberta history winter 1997 ninety one by this time he had received alb e rta honourary degrees from the university
 histor 1 al j of alberta and st john s college and j 1 ibpi td r eview was recognized

 peel wrote that during the difficult years of the depression of the 1930 s he was summ 1956 r ffw

 circumstances agent j p longpre to let them have a cars came to a halt currie then formally we don

 arrested s hoop but released him readers will understand the vowing to take it in any case longpre immediately since
 it was not possible to 1 tnation and judge this issue telegraphed to john niblock the cpr lock him up
 in the unheated of the news leniently superintendent for the area indicating detachment that farmers were holding the train that
 it included five cars of coal for the use of other men prevented the train from the cpr and asking
 for instructions and being mobilized and moving off currie the price of the coal longpre s message made another arrest
 and immediate conveyed the impression that a hold up release this time of h winsor had already occurred it also
 revealed according to the nanton news of that he expected the company to sell the february 7 these arrests did
 little more coal niblock s response makes a brick than transform passive bystanders into wall look spongy he told longpre
 to refuse coal to the crowd to refuse active participants eventually the money as it was a case of highjacking
 freight train with the coal cars had to back into the station and onto a siding to and to demand
 mounted police protection for the train he proclaimed let a passenger train pass by at that that the fuel crisis
 was more serious point the conductor removed the front car because its draw bar had broken and elsewhere especially since
 coal and wood were available nearby nanton 9 attempted to reassemble the train but members of the crowd had separated
 all above longpre showed the message to the cars and the conductor went to the item from the nanton news
 february constable currie who was at the station office to contemplate his next move 7 1907 probably hoping to get
 some coal then the crowd put on the handbrakes of himself since there was none at the each car the
 brakeman trailed along detachment in the meantime while the releasing them but he was followed by train idled on a
 siding charles wells a others who put the brakes back on then porter at whipple s restaurant climbed several members
 of the crowd stood on on one of the coal cars and filled a sack each car preventing the brakeman
 from currie told him to stop and he did releasing them again giving up the clearly currie did try to
 enforce the law attempt to move the train conductor as requested but this proved hopeless anderson wired calgary about the
 state for just as longpre was asking currie to of affairs it now being about 12 noon protect the train
 it began to pull out of the train crew went to dinner after the station and the crowd rushed after
 it locking the door to the office the station several men jumped on the back and one agent and the
 assistant agent also went of them ira w shoop an experienced to dinner rather surprisingly so did trainman from the
 united states constable curie 2 alberta history winter 1997 with all authorities out to lunch so to speak the citizens
 were now in full control of the train did they run amok and trample each other in a mad scramble
 for coal no they held a meeting out on the station platform chairing the session while standing on a case
 of coal oil was no less than the baptist minister j s hunter while the presbyterian minister ac bryan took
 minutes then perhaps because of the rumour that a detachment of mounted police was being sent from macleod by special
 train a series of motions were made and passed in rapid order a solidarity pact was made whereby it was
 agreed to stick together and to pay a proportionate share of expenses should any legal costs result from their action
 the group concluded that the contents of three coal cars would be made available it was also resolved that each
 farmer could have one ton each town dweller would receive half a ton and the school would get two tons
 the price was set at 6 00 a ton at the upper range of usual rates h m shaw was
 selected to weigh the coal and receive the payments while three others were elected to oversee operations after three cheers
 for shoop and henry winsor the two men who had been arrested and released the meeting disbanded by the time
 the authorities returned from dinner many of these motions had already been accepted for the rest of the afternoon matters
 proceeded smoothly enough farmers and townsfolk got their teams and lined up for their share the assistant agent went over
 to the loading site to ensure that the fence was not cut to make a roadway but everything was orderly
 and controlled the names of those who got coal were called to a z jessup the editor of the news
 who turned over the list to longpre who in turn gave it to constable curie currie in fact just stood
 by without attempting to intervene reasoning that it would be no use against a hundred men or so 4 interestingly
 enough currie did not even send a telegram to his co reporting on the situation the only one who seemed
 excited was niblock he wired longpre blaming the train crew and the mounted policeman longpre telegraphed back that they had
 all done everything possible by five o clock the three cars had been unloaded they were then uncoupled and the
 reduced train proceeded on its way the hold up was over 5 but what would be the consequences action against
 the vigilantes could have been taken from three directions by the mounted police by the cpr or by the office
 of the provincial attorney general constable curie was not anxious to initiate charges not only had he not telegraphed primrose
 he had not even mailed a report immediately his rationale i did not report because i thought that if i
 did i might have to take action but if i waited it might come through the c p r instead
 of me i thought it would be better for the c p r to take action and i could be
 a witness 1 at best this was a flimsy excuse for not making a report and at worst it was
 deliberate evasion the day after the episode curie conveniently left nanton to attend to some unspecified duties further north in
 fact he did not make his report on the incident until the investigating inspector starnes told him to 7 view
 of nanton three months after the train robbery this is from a postcard part of the old postmark can be
 seen above the buildings alberta history winter 1997 as a consequence of curie s neglect superintendent primrose the mounted police
 co for the area only learned of the episode from an agitated telegram sent on wednesday morning by r r
 jamieson the general superintendent for the western division of the cpr one of our freight trains held up at nanton
 yesterday by about 125 men and 3 cars of coal taken by force wired agent to have mounted police protect
 train but officer failed to do this will you please take case in hand 8 primrose took the matter seriously
 but did not consider it an emergency he agreed to send inspector starnes up from macleod the next day starnes
 was to investigate the matter and gather evidence for a possible prosecution but primrose played down the episode by noting
 that farmers elsewhere had taken similar action most importantly he informed the rnwmp commissioner of a change in weather chinook
 started this a m weather now warmer in other words primrose was implying that with better weather highjacking coal cars
 was not likely to become an epidemic in his area at least 9 starnes investigation seemed to show that everyone
 involved had behaved responsibly and rationally 2 the station agents and train crew had attempted to move the train along
 but had not uttered inflammatory threats and had been reasonable in accepting the inevitable constable currie had made attempts to
 deter the crowd to prevent the crippling of the train and to prevent its hold up but he had also
 acted sensibly in not incarcerating those he arrested in not attempting a heroic rescue of the train and in simply
 watching proceedings while taking note of the prime movers even the robbers themselves emerge from starnes investigation as a controlled
 responsible lot they had been waiting for coal for days they were led by some of the most prominent and
 respectable citizens in the community they acted openly and in concert they gave their names to the authorities they paid
 for what they took they did no damage to station property or cpr property other than the pull bar on
 the first car behind the engine and they had caused no physical injuries to anyone starnes report seemed to exonerate
 everyone all parties having behaved properly and done their job honourably as a result the mounties were not anxious to
 press charges primrose asked commissioner perry whether prosecutions were to be entered against the nanton highjackers 2 in turn perry
 asked the office of the attorney general of alberta for instructions which was another way of saying that the mounties
 were unlikely to press charges unless the attorney general required such action when it was in fact left to the
 mounted police no prosecutions were entered indeed it seems that fred white the comptroller and primary political agent of the
 mounties in ottawa had always assumed that the nanton raiders had been provoked into their illegal act for on february
 8 th he instructed the commissioner to have his men patrol throughout alberta and saskatchewan in order to keep abreast
 of actual fuel conditions and to provide relief in cases of emergency 24 the group concluded that the contents of
 three coal cars would be made available it was also resolved that each farmer could have one ton each town
 dweller would receive half a ton and the school would get two tons d alberta history winter 1997 cpr authorities
 themselves quickly lost their desire to prosecute of course they recoiled in horror at the thought of a train hold
 up but the circumstances of the theft itself had been so transparent so civilized so supported by all elements of
 the community that it may have seemed fruitless to proceed the cpr had suffered little more than delay and inconvenience
 the company had been financially compensated for the coal so what was the loss certainly its officials would not like
 the precedent but that could be dismissed as a result of some highly unusual circumstances moreover a court case had
 the potential to put the company in a bad light for an explanation would be required for the failure to
 deliver coal cars the eighty miles from lethbridge to nanton in the days since they were supposedly shipped no doubt
 the cpr simply diverted those coal cars to other needs the nanton raiders would then be able to argue that
 that is all they had done in turn 25 convictions would have been unlikely at least if the cases were
 heard in nanton itself no doubt witnesses would have developed willful ignorance of the details of the episode as the
 editor of the nanton news put it in regard to the men involved in disconnecting the air brakes we could
 not see who these men were and on the q t we don t want to know 26 in any
 case by the afternoon after the holdup r r jamieson telegraphed to primrose a more tranquil message than his fiery
 wire earlier in the day will you kindly withhold any positive action with regard to my wire this morning until
 further advised may only call on your officer to assist agent at nanton to collect the charges soon as i
 know what the coal should be charged out at that was the last one sees of any cpr desire to
 prosecute the office of the provincial attorney general had a potential interest in pressing charges since the whole matter of
 public order was involved the calgary herald expressed the problem in the following manner if the farmers and others along
 the line get the hold up habit calgary will be in a worst sic position than ever with no coal
 for the engines the supply of fuel which comes in the city would be curtailed and the city would suffer
 from the effects of the hold up 28 it was possible to fear that coal hold ups could disrupt and
 destroy the entire fuel distribution system throughout the west it was not an idle concern for the integrity of the
 transportation infrastructure is key to the effective operation of any modern economy but the anxiety lifted along with the temperatures
 by february 7 the herald s report on the hold up was jocular in tone suggesting for example that fuel
 in the southern town has of late been as scarce as conservatives in a liberal club room the calgary albertan
 also found the affair amusing the leader of the nanton coal raiders was harry windsor the baseball captain which shows
 that a good base stealer can very readily adjust himself to the more useful arts of life to joke about
 the episode was to say that it should not be taken seriously certainly not to the point of prosecution the
 high river times of february 14 1907 also thought charges unwarranted but not because it was amused under the headline
 nanton hold up justified it stated the action of the people of nanton in holding up a train load of
 coal may appear to partake somewhat of the lynching methods of the south no doubt those implicated have committed an
 offence against the law but when all the circumstances are considered it is generally conceded that the moral alberta history

 charge of weighing and distributing the coal appropriated by nanton residents during the bitter winter of 1906 0 7 his
 ad as a real estate agent appeared in the same issue of the nanton news as the report of the

 for taking the coal 3 eighty six loads of to 40 degrees below zero and no coal were weighed out
 and a number of coal to heat the home or office one these were divided between two or more is
 apt to be desperate and this was families 32 given the likelihood that the condition of affairs at nanton young
 family members were also along add to this the fact that local coal to help with loading it seems probable
 dealers had been advised about a that well in advance of 100 persons were week before of a shipment of
 coal involved in the hold up at the time the from lethbridge which had not entire population of the village
 of arrived at the time of the hold up nanton was about 500 in other words and you have a
 situation which the community was completely united in justifies these people in taking this activity as rev hunter put it
 when matters in their own hands nearly a chairing the meeting on the train week to ship a carload of
 coal from platform it was a case of necessity 34 lethbridge to nanton less than 100 the citizens felt that
 no apologies were miles it would serve the railway required they had merely done what company right if these nanton
 was needed and justified under the people had not paid for the coal circumstances the conclusion of the nanton news
 was as follows in short newspapers either dismissed the incident or defended the they have paid a big price for
 the perpetrators given that to some degree coal delivered at nanton and while the attorney general s office their course
 may not have been in represented and responded to public accordance with strict etequette sentiment it is not surprising that
 s b sic in high society there was woods the deputy attorney general nothing sneaking nor underhanded informed the mounties
 that he had no about it and they have nothing to be instructions to give regarding ashamed of prosecution 3
 in fact the case of the nanton train thus did the nanton vigilante train highjackers is an excellent example of
 robbers get off scot free they had done vigilantism in its most inoffensive the deed in such an open orderly
 unassailable even admirable form unified fashion that no one was willing to do more than utter a mild tut tut
 as for the law enforcement authorities indeed the occasional examples of their failure to prosecute seems vigilantism in alberta seem
 little more eminently sensible no real harm had than the safety valve of the criminal been done order had prevailed
 the justice system certainly when a criminal justice system had not really community was of one mind there was been
 challenged for even the little that law enforcement officials perpetrators recognized that their actions could do about it even if
 they wanted to were based on highly unusual in the nanton episode the hold up crowd circumstances that were unlikely
 to be included a broad cross section there repeated other communities were not were ministers of religion merchants liable to
 follow the example especially farmers townsfolk people from after the calgary papers made sport of different ethnic groups and no
 doubt the event as though saying that the poor young and old the number involved is rubes in the countryside
 could do little not known precisely the estimates more than resort to such primitive made by various people at various

 in federation history did more to create esprit de corps by all accounts the convention was a among the members
 2 through the very successful event some even going years this esprit de corps has been so far as to
 call it one of the best evident in the activities of the calgary conventions ever held 7 but it was
 not bpw as it has continued to focus on entirely confined to the serious topics many issues of particular interest

 many years was rather startled to see 120 starving as a result of this wartime twinning 7 many of the
 issues the bpw tackled were controversial at the time but there does not appear to have been any militancy or
 overt activism used to promote their point of view right members of the club presented a skit dealing with fascism
 and the league of nations this was part of a program to address current issues of the day alberta history
 winter 1997 at the end of the war the club was able to turn its attention to women s issues
 the war had emphasized once again the ability of women to contribute to the workplace and the economy of the
 country the club began with renewed vigour to ensure that the lessons of selfreliance and confidence that had been learned
 over the war years were not forgotten or abandoned in the rush to find employment for the returning soldiers a
 1947 committee report of the calgary bpw acknowledged that many of the clubs had been crushed by the commitment required
 by the war effort but they expressed the hope that the revival of the bpw movement around the world would
 continue until gainfully employed women have taken their rightful position in economic political and social fields until they have done
 their full part in bringing into being that world of peace and social justice which alone can mean new hope
 for humanity 77 improvement of the economic employment and social conditions of women but they also work towards the establishment
 of a high standard of service in business the professions industry and public life these goals are accomplished through a
 wide range of activities from educational seminars participation in and support of schoolrelated activities to encourage young women to pursue
 higher education and since its modest beginnings over sixtyfive years ago the calgary bpw has evolved into an organization of
 dynamic energetic women involved in all areas of business and the professions in calgary the original goal of the founders
 to attain equitable status for canadian women has been achieved in large part due to the tenacious persistence and determination
 of those brave and forward thinking women who believed wholeheartedly in the ability of women to compete with men in
