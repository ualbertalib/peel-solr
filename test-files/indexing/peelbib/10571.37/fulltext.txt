 6 lady patricia ramsay va cl cd obituary lady patricia ramsay one of two surviving grandchildren of queen victoria who 
 lived for more than half a century after divesting herself of the outward signs of royalty and her place in 
 the family and had in consequence become largely forgotten died on the 12th of january 1974 she was the youngest 
 child of queen victoria s favourite son prince albert the duke of connaught and strathearn and was closely connected with 
 the old ruling houses of europe through her mother a daughter of the celebrated red prince of russia born princess 
 victoria patricia helena elizabeth of connaught at buckingham palace on the 17th of march 1886 she shunned the conventional royal 
 marriage in 1919 she married captain alexander ramsay royal navy and relinquished all rights and titles to royalty she and 
 her husband later to become admiral the honourable sir alexander ramsay gcvo kgb dso lived unostentatious lives he pursuing his 
 naval career and she her love of painting in 1911 she went with her parents to canada where her father 
 was governor general her mother was in failing health and in fact died in canada so that she became her 
 father s official companion and hostess she made herself not only extremely useful but extremely popular a piece of territory 
 in northwestern ontario and in the southern interior of british columbia were named in her honour in august of 1914 
 her father approved the use of her name in the title of a canadian regiment being raised at the personal 
 expense of a hamilton gault of montreal princess patricia s canadian light infantry became her constant concern she rejoiced with 
 the regiment in it s triumphs and grieved in its losses and casualties in 1918 she was named colonel in 
 chief and so remained until her death lady patricia s father was colonel in chief of the rifle brigade the 
 allied regiment of the patricias for over 50 years she delighted to think of her father and herself being in 
 the unique position of jointly having over 100 years service as colonels in chief of allied regiments 
 7 she designed and worked by hand a camp flag which she presented to the patricias before they departed ottawa 
 for service in france this flag affectionately referred to as the ric a dam doo was carried into every action 
 the regiment took part in during the great war 1914 1918 the only such flag or colour to be taken 
 into action by any unit of the british empire during that period princess pat or patsy as she was called 
 by her family and intimates who was a great aunt of her majesty queen elizabeth shattered royal tradition by playing 
 golf skiing swimming and riding a horse astride instead of side saddle she kept a pet parrot that travelled with 
 her everywhere often perched on her shoulder lady patricia had one son captain alexander arthur ramsay formerly of the grenadier 
 guards born on the 21st of december 1919 and married in 1956 to the honourable flora fraser daughter and heiress 
 of the 19th lord saltoun although after her marriage she retired from public duties she always made an exception for 
 her regiment she inspected it in 1940 and visited it in germany in 1950 and in canada in 1953 her 
 last visit to the regiment was to the first battalion in germany and the second battalion in canada in august 
 and september of 1964 in conjunction with the 50th jubilee celebrations in 1968 although ill she insisted on seeing a 
 detachment of the second battalion perform at the royal tournament in london characteristically she wanted only a simple funeral at 
 her request the colonel of the regiment major general cb ware a bearer party and two buglers alone represented the 
 thousands who have borne her name attended by queen elizabeth queen ingrid of denmark and other members of europe s 
 royal households internment took place in the royal burial grounds at frogmore following services at windsor castle on the 21st 
 of january 1974 
 8 rod sykes mayor calgary canada the princess patricia s canadian light infantry will be celebrating 0:cele 0:brating its 60th 
 anniversary in 1974 sixty years for many people often means retirement but from my close association with the ppcli i 
 know that your anniversary celebrations will only spur you on to greater efforts in the years to come you have 
 served this country with honor and distinction in war and in peace time i know this service will continue in 
 the years ahead at the age of 60 the ppcli is taking a more active and constructive role in the 
 community than ever the cadet program for example offers young people an excellent opportunity for knowledge and development i know 
 first hand one of my sons is now a cadet he will tell you most enthusiastically what our armed forces 
 can do for youngsters also you have the finest band in the country and no important public occasion in alberta 
 is complete without the princess patricia s magnificent band in which our whole community takes enormous pride at a time 
 when so many bands across canada have been cut from the official strength in an apparent quest for economy a 
 misguided quest when applied to bands the elimination of which produces picayune savings at best it is a source of 
 some satisfaction that the princess patricia s band has survived alone in the distinction of being the only remaining military 
 band serving the western prairies an area larger than the territory of most of the u n s member nations 
 long may you continue to stir our hearts and raise our spirits members of the ppcli you don t look 
 your age please keep up your vigor and your enthusiasm my best wishes to you all if i can ever 
 help you you have only to call on me since rely may cri 
 9 colonel of the regiment s message major general c b ware dso cd 1973 was an eventful and highly 
 successful year for all battalions of the regiment for the first time in many years all were serving in canada 
 they ranged throughout the west and north with imcomparable zeal and zest on every conceivable form of military exercise and 
 training although service in cyprus was not in the plans there were the usual many individuals and small groups to 
 be found in united nations service in many countries toward the end of the year larger numbers were sent to 
 egypt where they will carry out their diverse duties in the usual competent fashion the troops are young fit enthusiastic 
 and full of pride the battalions are well commanded well trained thoroughly competent and morale is high preparations were put 
 in hand for celebrating our diamond jubilee however the record of these and the reports on the exploits of individual 
 battalions will be found elsewhere in this volume suffice it to say that i found the regular battalions a great 
 credit to canada and to those who served before them from 1914 to the present our jubilee year sadly commenced 
 with the grave blow we suffered in the loss of our beloved colonel in chief she had long been prepared 
 for the next stage of existence i ve come to feel latterly that it is only a small step away 
 and no great break this is because so many of my dearest ones have gone on and they feel so 
 close and alive still i can never think of them as dead such was an extract from one of her 
 letters but she went on as always to express her ever present concern for my beloved regiment the regiment was 
 the unceasing interest in her life and always in her thoughts and those thoughts were always proud and affectionate ones 
 she followed our every fortune through two world wars and korea she was happy in our triumphs and grieved in 
 our casualties in peacetime she continued in the same pattern and followed all our activities with no less devotion and 
 diligence she gloried in her triumphant visit to first battalion in germany and second battalion in edmonton during our jubilee 
 in 1964 she was pleased and enchanted to be there to review her regiment exactly fifty years later her father 
 h r h prince arthur the duke of connaught was colonel in chief of our allied regiment the rifle brigade 
 for over fifty years and she delighted to think of her father and herself being in the unique position of 
 jointly having over 100 years service as colonels in chief of allied regiments although this was to be her last 
 visit to a battalion she insisted in 1968 although ill in seeing a detachment perform at the royal tournament in 
 london 
 10 i saw her last in may of 1973 she was ill no longer able to follow her great love 
 of painting and grieving at the loss of her husband although i saw her frequently and wrote regularly she always 
 looked forward to these verbal reports and this last was no exception she was worried as she had been for 
 some time that she could not do so many things which as colonel in chief she felt that she wished 
 to do she could no longer have visitors nor answer letters i was able to reassure her that our loyalty 
 and affection were ever constant although she undoubtedly knew it she was pleased she was sad that she could not 
 be on parade with us on our diamond jubilee as in 1964 however she followed the arrangements with much interest 
 and while lamenting her illness she asked me to tell the regiment that she would certainly be with us in 
 spirit and i have no doubt that this indeed is the case the funeral was impressive yet simple as she 
 would have wished it was a private royal service at st george s chapel in windsor castle as such it 
 was under the aegis of the lord chamberlain her majesty the queen and queen ingrid of denmark attended as did 
 other members of the british royal family and foreign royal relatives along with her son captain alexander ramsay and the 
 honorable mrs alexander ramsay with other close members of the family lady patricia had requested that she be borne by 
 members of her regiment and that i should represent all serving and veteran patricias as the colonel of her regimental 
 family this was done the bearers were drawn from all battalions under the command of the regimental adjutant the party 
 and the regimental buglers were superb and quite faultless although intensely sad it was comforting to know that her regiment 
 was with her to the end she was buried in the royal burial grounds at frogmore beside her husband and 
 her grandmother queen victoria it has been anticipated that there might have been a large memorial service in britain where 
 the regiment and association might be well represented as this shall not be patricia battalions association branches and individuals shall 
 be holding memorial services wherever they may be on our colonel in chiefs birthday on the seventeenth of march in 
 ottawa the service shall be attended by our new governor general his excellency the right honorable jules leger cc and 
 so we come to the end of an era we are an unique regiment for many reasons we have been 
 fortunate to have been raised as we were by brigadier hamilton gault as a sporting and patriotic venture and we 
 have been privileged to have our colonel in chief with us for almost sixty years i do not expect that 
 any regiment shall ever again have the close relations with a colonel in chief that we enjoyed on her part 
 such devotion and on ours such unfailing loyalty and affection she shall live on forever in our hearts and she 
 shall always live through her regiment which i know shall continue to serve canada always in her name and trust 
 with spirit valour and distinction she would neither expect nor ask more 
 11 editor s page the death of lady patricia ramsay overshadows all the activities of 1973 this is as it 
 should be for she was the pillar of our loyalty the focal point of our affections and the epitome of 
 what the regiment stands for after all she was the regiment without her we would not have the stature that 
 we have we can hold our heads high and be proud that we have known her and have served her 
 in peace and in war her memory will now live on in her regiment as she would have it we 
 have a tradition to uphold and expand lady patricia would not have us mourn her for long this she would 
 not tolerate we shall pause reflect and carry on her regiment will forever be her memorial a living memorial vibrant 
 full of life and ever ready to do the tasks required of it it is my desire to record for 
 posterity the names of a master warrant officer and twelve corporals a group selected to be the bearers and buglers 
 to attend at the funeral of lady patricia men who without exception produced the solemnity pageantry and ceremonial required of 
 the occasion men who represented and epitomized all facets of the regiment truly it was said she was carried on

 the thousands who serve and have served the regiment during the year 1973 it was your editor s privilege to 
 again visit many facets of the regimental family 
 12 the first visit was made to cyprus to join second battalion in the celebration of the colonel in chief 
 s birthday being in the company of the lieutenant governor of the province of manitoba the colonel of the regiment 
 and the president of the regimental association was indeed a distinct pleasure from cyprus i travelled to england and three 
 days at hatch court this time was spent perusing a great quantity of the founder s correspondence and manuscripts an 
 exciting find was the original inventory of kit and equipment as issued to the regiment in august of 1914 the 
 total cost of which absorbed most of the founder s 100 000 00 many other documents and letters of regimental 
 importance were also uncovered commander and mrs nation are very efficiently maintaining the gault collection and a very significant museum 
 of regimental artifacts the summer saw changes of command in both first and third battalion the untimely death of lieutenant 
 colonel r f bruce mbe cd precluded my attending at first battalion s change of command however i can report 
 that third battalion performed in a most exemplary manner a week end in september was the time for a historic 
 reunion and edmonton was the location the loyal edmonton regiment 4 ppcli in conjunction with the edmonton branch of the 
 regimental association and the forty niners were the hosts for a combined reunion and annual meetings of both associations we 
 can be truly proud of the professionalism of our fourth battalion now we move into our 60th diamond jubilee year 
 a year of celebration and ceremony which our late colonel in chief would not have wanted altered in any way 
 we will be celebrating by exercising our right to the freedom of the city of winnipeg performed by second battalion 
 on the 24th of april third battalion will troop their regimental colour in july they will also receive the freedom 
 of the city of victoria on behalf of the regiment in june first battalion will perform the ceremony of trooping 
 the colour on the 10th of august and host the national reunion at the same time the royal 22e regiment 
 also celebrates its diamond jubilee this year to mark the association between the two regiments there will be an exchange 
 of platoons and a combined guard of honour on parliament hill the patricia platoon has now visited la citadelle during 
 the winter carnival and the r22er platoon will visit calgary during stampede week the guard of honour will likely be 
 during july it behoves all of us to support the celebrations wherever possible and join in a common band of 
 camaraderie to strengthen the regiment s stature by this means we will be adding further to the memory of lady 
 patricia ramsay and to those who have served and died for the regiment

 14 to 
 15 the great war 1914 18 the regiment s victoria crosses by lt waymouth and ocdt salmon 1 ppcli it 
 was october 1917 and the regiment under the command of lieutenant colonel agar adamson dso had just been moved into 
 the area of the ypres salient the region of the coming battle was at the same time both familiar and 
 new to the patricias for it was here in early june 1916 that the regiment had experienced the ordeal of 
 sanctuary wood and mount sorrel the intervening year had seen the city of ypres reduced to little more than a 
 colossal ruin rendered as such by months of artillery and aerial bombardment the rains of the summer of 1917 had 
 produced a quagmire in the maze of trenches making up the battle lines it was indeed a dismal setting but 
 the fighting of that summer had been heartening it had been the desire of the commander in chief to force 
 the germans from the city of ypres permanently after some three years of occupation in the two months of august 
 and september some 3000 yards of new territory was added to the main line when this advance broke down on 
 swampy ground near cambrai the third army of which the canadian corps was part was called upon to maintain pressure 
 in its own sector it was to this end that the regiment moved to ypres from their arrival in the 
 area the patricias were in for a difficult time the war years had seen considerable improvement in the methods of 
 german artillery and air bombing and even in its somewhat withdrawn position in the ypres suburbs the regiment did not 
 escape casualties fortunately the list of injured was considerably shorter than those of the units immediately facing the enemy the 
 corps offensive began on 26 october this initial action saw the patricias in reserve four days later however saw the 
 regiment join in one of its most fierce actions just west of passchendaele there exist two narrow spurs of ground 
 which control in their elevation the western approach to the village the southern feature was known as the meetcheele ridge 
 the fact that the attackers would need to attack up hill was not in itself disheartening the canadians had already 
 stormed much more difficult positions however a defence system of concrete pillboxes made this task rather formidable this was to 
 be the objective for the patricias 30 october dawned bleak and windy no less miserable for its lack of rain 
 the 2000 yards of ground over which the regiment was to advance was frightful with mud and shell holes in 
 order to provide some manoeuvrability to the attacking troops the canadians for the first time incorporated looser group formations in 
 each of the waves this allowed greater freedom for command and initiative on the part of the sub unit commanders 
 such innovations hardly made the regiment s job less difficult ralph hodder williams refers to the passchendaele terrain as the 
 worst ground fought 
 16 over in the war so thick was the mud that the regimental pipers were unable to play the attackers 
 over the top the regiment attacked on a two company frontage of about 500 yards number 2 company commanded by 
 captain m ten broeke mc was on the right number 3 company commanded by major t m papineau mc was 
 on the left number 4 company commanded by captain j r macpherson supported number 2 company and number 1 company 
 commanded by captain w h morris mc supported number 3 company as the companies scrambled forward every conceivable form of 
 indirect and direct fire fell upon them under such conditions it is no wonder that the first few hours saw 
 most of the unit s officers and senior nco s become casualties the mere fact that the advance was maintained 
 is a clear indication of the heart and soul put into the task at hand by every member of the 
 regiment by early morning what was left of the battalion was attacking the final objective the meetcheele spur as the 
 patricia s number gradually thinned a last hurdle all but broke the back of the attack a well sited pillbox 
 atop the spur was producing devastatingly accurate fire apparently impervious to our direct and indirect fire the action that followed 
 when all but heart had failed can only be sufficiently described by the following commendation which appeared respectively in the 
 13 february and 11 january 1918 editions of the london gazette for most conspicuous bravery and leading when in charge 
 of a section of four machine guns accompanying the ppcli in their attack on the meetcheel ridge passchendaele on the 
 morning of october 30 1917 seeing that all the officers and most of the non commissioned officers of an infantry 
 company had become casualties and that men were hesitating before a nest of enemy machine guns which were on commanding 
 ground and causing them severe casualties he handed over command of his guns to a n c 0 rallied the 
 infantry organized an attack and captured the strong point finding that the position was swept by machine gun fire from 
 a pill box which dominated all the ground over which the troops were advancing lt mckenzie made a reconnaissance and 
 detailed flanking and frontal attacking parties which captured the pill box he himself being killed while leading the frontal attack 
 by his valour and leadership this gallant officer ensured the capture of these strong points and so saved the lives 
 of many men and enabled the objectives to be attained and for most conspicuous bravery in the attack on the 
 meetcheele ridge passchendaele on the morning of october 30 1917 when single handed he captured a commanding pill box which 
 had withstood the heavy bombardment and was causing heavy casualties to our forces and holding up the attack he rushed 
 a snipers post in front and destroyed the garrison with bombs and crawling on to the top of the pill 
 box he shot the two machine gunners with his 
 17 revolver sgt mullin then rushed to another entrance and compelled the garrison of ten to surrender his gallantry and 
 fearlessness were witnessed by many and although rapid fire was directed upon him and his clothes were riddled by bullets 
 he never faltered in his purpose and he not only helped to save the situation but also saved many lives 
 so cited were the first two victoria crosses earned by the regiment the patricias were able to move on and 
 successfully consolidate their objective because of many such examples of individual leadership and valour from all ranks unfortunately when on 
 31 october the regiment was relieved in the line only a fraction of the unit remained nine officers had been 
 killed with 11 being wounded 150 men were either killed or missing and 193 were wounded considerable praise came to 
 the patricas for this action but it had been dearly won some ten months later saw the regiment under the 
 command of lieutenant colonel c j t stewart dso in another bitterly contested action the battle of amiens early august 
 1918 brought the beginning of the most successful phase of the allied operation in flanders in the first world war 
 with the initial surprise attack on amiens the war suddenly became mobile as the germans fell back in confusion it 
 was hoped that the stalemate of trench warfare was finally over as the attacking armies drove thousands of metres into 
 the defensive positions throughout 8 9 august the german armies were pushed steadily back however by late on the 9th 
 the german high command was able to inject into the line considerably more well trained reserves than had been expected 
 bringing the offensive to a halt along the somme canal for the initial few days tne patricias had been in 
 brigade reserve and had not therefore been actively engaged by the 10th the regiment once more found itself occupying a 
 trench system in front of parvillers with direction to clear the trenches and assist its neighbouring battalions in resuming the 
 offensive 12 august saw the regiment begin a co ordinated attack which involved some very dirty trench clearing in the 
 wooded outskirts of the village the going was very difficult and the resistance was determined unfortunately the early morning found 
 german counter attacks driving the patricias flanking battalion back from its position leaving no 3 company ppcli terribly exposed very 
 quickly the soldiers found themselves hard pressed on both flanks and from the rear by a battalion sized force the 
 situation left little to do but attempt a withdrawal a very desperate manoeuvre in the face of mounting german pressure 
 it was a fire and movement action with considerable close in fighting and provided another opportunity for individual gallantry and 
 sacrifice for which the patricias were becoming increasingly well known it was incidents such as the one involving sgt robert 
 spall that once more illustrated the mettle of which the regiment was made for most conspicuous bravery and self sacrifice 
 on the night of august 12 to 13 1918 near parvillers when his platoon 
 18 was isolated during and enemy counter attack sgt spall took a lewis gun and standing on the parapet fired 
 upon the advancing enemy inflicting severe casualties he then came down the trench directing the men into a sap seventy 
 five yards from the enemy picking up another lewis gun this gallant n c o again climbed the parapet and 
 by his fire held up the enemy it was while holding up the enemy at this point that he was 
 killed sgt spall deliberately gave his life in order to extricate his platoon from a most difficult position and it 
 was owing to his bravery that the platoon was saved this is the citation for the third victoria cross won 
 by the regiment as it appeared in the 26 october 1918 gazette the regiment did not fare well in the 
 battle of amiens in the matter of ground gained and retained counter attacks by overwhelming forces twice pushed the patricias 
 back to the start line however as hodder williams states the fact must be recorded as one of the most 
 remarkable in its history that the losses at amiens were far lighter than in any other action of equal magnitude 
 nevertheless it must be noted that the total casualties of the patricias during the eight days of the battle of 
 amiens were 152 two officers killed and five wounded 23 other ranks killed 9 missing and 113 wounded it must 
 never be forgotten that a regiment is a whole or single entity but at the same time a collection of 
 individuals which mould the fabric and personality of that entity the recipients of the regiment s three v c s

 19 first battalion as this article is being prepared all ranks of the first battalion were grieved to learn of 
 the death of our colonel in chief lady patricia ramsay but we know of the warm feeling she had for 
 her regiment and she will be paid special homage at a memorial service to be held on her birthday march 
 17th 1974 is of course an important year for this battalion and all patricia s as we celebrate our diamond 
 jubilee we can look back on 1973 as another year of achievment in that as well as continuing our normal 
 role in defence of canada operation and support to various organizations during the summer months we carried out important mountain 
 training in kananaskis and have begun to train our own pay level 3 private soldiers from all reports the level 
 of instruction and the organization of our training company is superb and we know the young soldiers who graduate will 
 be worthy members of the battalion the training that this battalion conducted in 1973 is best described through the eyes 
 of the rifle companies in their reports which follow this article suffice it is to say that all ranks were 
 especially enthused about such highlights as exercise pegasus challenge and we re happy to report that lieutenant dan davies officer 
 commanding recce platoon will be running another mountain training camp in kananaskis this coming summer as part of our diamond 
 jubilee celebrations the first battalion will troop on the 10th of august we sincerely hope that the representation of patricias 
 in the calgary area will be great to all the readers of the patrician from all members of the first 
 battalion happy anniversary and all the best of luck in 1974 headquarters company 1973 during 1973 it seemed the only 
 time headquarters company was together was during commanding officer s parades the 5 platoons and company headquarters were either spread 
 across wainwright or other parts of canada as usual the company got off to good start in 73 on winter 
 training exercise queen s ransom which was held in everybody s favorite garden spot wainwright found the platoons giving their 
 support to the remainder of the battalion during the exercise the odd humorous event occurred pioneer platoon commander was called 
 upon to flow the ice at purple ford his task was unknown to the commanding officer until the water came 
 over his knees also on the light side signals platoon found out that you cannot pitch an arctic tent on 
 a tree stump and have the sides reach the ground of course it was dark putting these minor incidents aside 
 the company showed that it still has the experience required to carry out a winter warfare operation march saw the 
 company back together in calgary to celebrate the regimental birthday with our wives and girlfriends thoroughly enjoying the all ranks

 was conducted in the kananaskis mountains with a final move through the south kananaskis park to canal flats british columbia 
 the majority of the move was on foot but the latter stages saw the employment of assault boars and helicopters 
 all members of the company thoroughly enjoyed the exercise especially recce platoon instructors who found that the more boisterous company 
 sergeant majors became meek at times when in the centre of a 70 foot ravine standing on a vi inch 
 rope bridge pioneers contributed a baseball diamond complete with obstacles which drew the odd complaint from the rifle companys however 
 the battalion enjoyed the sauna they built on moccassin flats on our return to calgary the company participated in the 
 feu de joie and started shaking out for waincon milcon 73 also not to forget summer employment with cadets ssep 
 etc student summer employment plan congratulations to our armoured defence platoon who showed their expertise by winning the 106 recoilless 
 rifle competition against our rival battalions during waincon mortar platoon was kept busy with their live firing and training sub 
 units in fire controlling they were also exercised in quick action drills in a 3 royal canadian horse artillery competition 
 however as usual all subunits were more than happy to return to calgary and some annual leave in october the 
 company flag football team won the french grey cup by defeating a company another highlight of the day was miss 
 headquarters company winning the title miss french grey cup even if her pantyhose did not fit in closing out the 
 year armoured defence platoon reorganized into a dual role with the corps of drums and the remainder of the company 
 settled in to run pay level 4 courses about this time our company said farewell to our company sergeant major

 30 on our return to lower canada the company found itself in more familiar surroundings exercise pegasus challenge proved to 
 be just that a challenge the first part of the exercise was spent convincing all ranks that mountain ropes really 
 are safe mortar platoon joined us for the exercise phase and provided neccessary command support when officer commanding captain bob 
 kompf had to leave for op holly op swan lieutenant don kreuger found a new way to stop assault boats 
 hit a large rock luckily he practised gymnastics and did a near perfect flip into the kootenay river may found 
 the company taking part in the feu de joie and shaking out for waincon and milcon 73 in wainwright our 
 forced march team failed to win however our soccer team did manage to place as runners up much valuable experience 
 was gained and many lessons were learned during our wainwright sojourn all ranks of the company heaved a sigh of 
 relief as we packed up and prepared to move back to calgary for the summer leave period in early august 
 pay level 3 training became our major concern warrant officer holmes was given the monstrous task of co ordinating and 
 preparing the numerous reports and returns required to keep the organization afloat ancre heights platoon commanded by lieutenant dave waymouth 
 started training on the 13th of august arras 1917t8 platoon started shortly after on the 17th of september after a 
 full and rewarding training schedule both platoons have now finished their training and have joined the company the best candidate 
 from ancre heights platoon was private brian cameron private gerald topham came out first in arras 191718 platoon in september 
 personnel from the company not involved in pay level 3 training took part in a company exercise named romeo ramble 
 the exercise took place in the bow river forest area and was designed to familiarize the company with helicopter rapelling 
 and mountain training walking a few shakey moments were spent by all getting used to the rapelling in the end 
 however all ranks qualified and there was a constant fight to see who got up and out first apologies to 
 408 squadron also in september we had a change in company 21c s captain wayne thorton from rss eastern detachment 
 replaced captain dick robinson in october the company participated in the french grey cup and only just lost to headquarters 
 company corporal clayton mclean received the trophy for the most valuable player and officer cadet doug salmon received the trophy 
 for outstanding lineman a company still maintains their queen was the prettiest even though she didn t win in november 
 we lost corporal gordie burnell and privates pete melvin phil mosby don philpott and kevin macdonald to unef egypt we 
 know they will do well at what ever they re required to do the end of the year saw a 
 company handling its pay level 3 operation to the newly formed training company the company is now getting into winter 
 training with the united states forces and looking forward to exercise ace card vii in alaska after the new year 
 
 31 b company b company started off the new year reviving the old skills of winter warfare the many new 
 faces within the company had their feet firmly planted in the snow for the first time we were then off 
 to wainwright for exercise queen s ransom an engineer officer lieutenant p howe who would be working with the company 
 during the ski championships volunteered to see what soldiering was all about with b company after polishing off the rough 
 edges b company entered the final exercise the weather proved to be a very important factor in this winter exercise 
 but even so everyone stood the test very well with winter exercise finished the next priority for the company was 
 the canadian forces ski championships which was held in banff the events all went well and everyone was pleased to 
 have come to this fantastic skiing area in the rocky mountains march 17th brought the usual regimental birthday celebrations plus 
 a new added feature called the chain of command race as you might have guessed b company proved to be 
 the winners the company re organized to prepare for pay level 3 training we said good bye to many good 
 soldiers at the farewell company party with a good time had by all our two new platoons arrived from cornwallis 
 in may and training was the top priority it is at this time we said good bye to our officer 
 commanding major l w mackenzie who was off to vietnam the summer months were going by very quickly our new 
 officer commanding captain v j s mckeen arrived in july just in time for stampede week b company exercised the 
 battalion s freedom of the city at this time firing a feu de joie with the royal canadian mounted police 
 commissioner as the reviewing officer with july coming to a close the company moved into the mountains for our final 
 pay level 3 exercise it involved training in navigation patrolling survival and an added feature helicopter rappelling many good lessons 
 were learned especially this one when rappelling you must always look at the ground after flying back from the mountains 
 we finished the exercise with prisoner of war training i m sure there will be memories of this aspect of 
 training for all in b company for some time to come suddenly graduation was here and annual leave was a 
 welcomed rest during the fall the company was very active doing annual refresher training specialty courses followed in october november 
 and december the year was drawing to a close very quickly at this time the company lost a very fine 
 soldier private r j lee who was killed in an accident christmas and the new year leave period were again 
 upon us and the cycle of winter training had started again c company report the year 1973 has been an 
 interesting one for the mechanized company it began as most years do with a winter exercise queen s ransom in 
 january held on that interesting piece of real estate camp wainwright the company lost her armoured personnel carriers for this 
 exercise as they were distributed throughout the battalion the company became snowshoe borne peons sad 
 32 blow to the platoon commanders and company commander who were known to fancy themselves as junior romels as a 
 matter of fact captain peter chamberlain that incredibly scruffy green jacket was heard to remark i came here for a 
 good time not a hard time and promptly joined the base ski team he fared fairly well he missed queen 
 s ransom and made it through the ski season without breaking any bones this left the company in the capable 
 hands of captain bob mclean and under his direction charlie company ricochetted around wainwright for the duration of the exercise 
 the only two incidents worth noting are the near total annihilation of a platoon from the airborne regiment foolish enough 
 to test our defences and the near demise of company headquarters through the use of captain mclean s catalytic heater 
 after his apparent success in battle captain mclean left the infantry and is now the base personnel selection officer captain 
 chamberlain once again took command of charlie company the ski season was over for our next event exercise pegasus challenge 
 this exercise proved to be one of the most interesting exercises for the young soldiers and most of the older 
 ones had been able to enjoy in quite some time the exercise began with four days of mountain training followed 
 by a trek over the south kananaskis pass to the palliser river we then got into assault boats and paddled 
 our way to canal flats where we were able to catch the stanley cup playoffs it should be noted that 
 charlie company covered more ground faster than all the other companies proof that we don t need armoured personnel carriers 
 to move fast warrant officer frank douglas navigates 0:navi 0:gates members of 9 platoon c company 0:com 0:pany down the

 waincon 73 where once again charlie company was able to use her beloved armoured personnel carriers to good advantage the 
 highlight of the period in wainwright was an escape and evasion exercise which allowed the young soldiers to apply their 
 fieldcraft and initiative to avoid recce platoon those that were captured ended up in the clutches of captain cassidy captain 
 robinson and sergeant wilson after twenty two hours of no food or sleep but plenty of harrassment mosquitoes and frequent 
 cold baths sergeant overton master corporal hibbs and private ferris had still refused to give any information they were much 
 relieved when finally freed by the remainder of charlie company it was felt by some that certain people would have 
 made excellent war criminals but to date those persons have still evaded capture the end of waincon 73 also marked 
 the end of captain chamberlain s tour in canada and we were very sorry to see him go we had 
 a fine party to celebrate this occasion and sent him back to britain with his pockets full of swamp mud 
 from mott lake we were promised a replacement but as yet he has not shown up we know that captain 
 henry lancelot ruck keene will be able to maintain the fine standard of professionalism set by captains rimmer and chamberlain 
 the remainder of the summer saw charlie company scattered to the four corners of the country and beyond lieutenant jim 
 lee spent three months in the northland on exercise new viking giving many people the benefit of his experience as 
 a patricia 
 34 lieutenant dan davies attended the american ranger course and showed the you alls how it was done by graduating 
 as an honor student many of us didn t recognize him on his return as he had lost his curly 
 locks and thirty one pounds warrant officer loucks help set up a cadet camp at whitehorse where sergeant gagne was 
 later to instruct survival techniques after which he went to gagetown to get his 6b qualification corporal hey our cqms 
 s driver also went to gagetown to learn of all things how to drive we are happy to report he 
 successfully completed the course sergeant bennett has since been posted to 2 princess patricias canadian light infantry a sad loss 
 for the ist battalion and charlie company the 2nd battalion have gained an excellent non commissioned officer and we hope 
 he will remember his friends in charlie company as we remember him for the remainder of us in charlie company 
 the summer passed quickly with student summer employment programme area rank and trades school cadet training etc some of us 
 even managed to fit in some leave the fall brought many changes to charlie company with postings and unit courses 
 we finally got a new company commander in major john bremer another man who believes that mech company must be 
 the elite as we are the ones to whom the rest of the battalion looks for the skills required of 
 a modern professional arm charlie company will continue to set the example and some day perhaps the rest of the 
 companies will be equipped to do the job as well as we can they will have to go a long 
 way to reacb our standard for we know we are the best just ask us as this year comes to 
 a close we can look back with pride on our accomplishments we look forward with anticipation to the coming events 
 of the new year knowing that charlie company will never be found lacking someday you too may be able to 
 serve with charlie company the mech company d company 1973 d company started the year by participating in exercise queens 
 ransom in wainwright during the month of january weather conditions were ideal for the exercise and the company had a 
 good opportunity to practise winter operations under realistic conditions in early march a platoon from d company accompanied a company 
 on exercise new viking returning to calgary in time to go with d company on exercise pegasus challenge the exercise 
 involved several days of mountain training in the kananaskis range west of calgary followed by a mountain walk and river 
 voyage down the kootney river to canal flats british columbia the exercise was successful in offering several physically and mentally 
 challenging opportunities to all members of the company including a grueling three hour army bus ride back to calgary immediately 
 following a company party at canal flats at the end of may after over two weeks of practise the company 
 produced a first class fifty man guard for the battalion feu de joie ceremony held at the currie barracks as 
 part of the canadian forces base calgary armed forces day celebration with the feu de joie ceremony completed we began 
 preparations for waincon 73 
 35 b company under command of captain v j mckeen cd exercises the freedom of the city of calgary during 
 stampede week 1973 the 1 ppcli flag football team which unfortunately lost out to the service battalion in an exciting 
 final 
 36 the company departed for wainwright on the 2nd of june with about fifty all ranks and after a week 
 of training together there a platoon commanded by captain dave rudd left wainwright for alaska where they were to participate 
 in two weeks field training with the united states army the withdrawl of this platoon effectively reduced the strength of 
 the company left in wainwright to the point where it was unable to participate as a sub unit in the 
 remainder of the concentration those fifteen members who did not go to alaska were therefore employed in constructing and operating 
 two field firing ranges for the remaining companies in the battalion not much glory for d company but at least 
 a sense of satisfaction from the well constructed and efficiently run ranges the platoon in alaska spent an excellent two 
 weeks on exercise with usaral and captain dave rudd master warrant officer frank buxton warrant officer ed bulger sergeant howie 
 gagnon corporal glen clyke privates stewart and forde were awarded their united states parachutist wings after completing several descents from 
 chinook helicopters in early july after everyone returned to calgary most of the company dispersed to take part in the 
 various militia and cadet assistance programmes for the remainder of the summer and also got some leave in during the 
 months of july and august the company s strength was brought up to 119 in mid september by the arrival 
 of some fifty new soldiers from gagetown and the month also saw the command of the company change hands from 
 captain bob burns to captain bill bewick unit courses commenced in october and about fifty percent of the company were 
 involved in these with the remainder participating in annual refresher training range work and winter indoctrination training until the commencement 
 of christmas leave in mid december privates bob conniff jerry stewart don mcßae and kirn whitaker departed for service with 
 unef egypt early in december although their tasks there are not particularly infantry like we are sure they will do 
 well in whatever is required of them and look forward to having them back in d company next summer the 
 new year will find the company without its platoon commanders as lieutenant jerry liboiron will depart for a three month 
 french language course in early january and lieutenant jim calvin will take command of a recruit training platoon in the 
 training company with all the new senior non commissioned officers we are looking forward to a successful new year and 
 expect to excel in everything we set out to do sp company 1973 was one of those years lots to 
 do but seemingly not enough time to do it in however we met all requirements of the battalion which is 
 our purpose and all ranks of the company displayed a professional approach to the given tasks a support company write 
 up with 12 sub units would be a lengthy report if we wrote up on each one so only the 
 highlights will be recorded

 53 the second world war the hitler line a bloody day at the hitler line lcol j l sharpe the 
 breaching of the hitler line in italy in may 1944 although a canadian success was a very bloody battle for 
 the patricia s in their heroic albeit unsuccessful attempt to seize their objective the ist canadian corps commanded by lieutenant 
 general burns was given the task of breaching the hitler line between the town of pontecorvo and the river forme 
 d aquino major general yokes with his ist canadian infantry division was to break the line and open a gap 
 for exploitation by the sth canadian armoured division commanded by major general hoffmeister the ist division was deployed with the 
 ist brigade left 3rd brigade centre and 2nd brigade right there were two divisional plans of attack plan one called 
 for a co ordinated assault on the centre and right by 3rd and 2nd brigades plan two called for an 
 attack on the left by the ist brigade and if successful the 2nd brigade would follow the ist brigade in 
 an attempt to turn the hitler line from the left plan one was eventually adopted six hours before h hour 
 the disposition of the 2nd brigade was seaforth of canada left patricia s right and the loyal edmonton regiment in 
 reserve tank support was provided by the north irish horse with two squadrons to the seaforth and one squadron to 
 the patricia s unfortunately this regiment was only assigned to the brigade the day before the attack and all previous 
 training and planning had been conducted with a different armoured unit the hitler line was a fortified defensive zone in 
 the liri valley although the line was never completed and was weak in infantry it was a formidable obstacle particularly 
 in the sector assigned to the 2nd brigade the approaches were guarded by thick aprons of wire and the ground 
 was sown with both anti tank and anti personnel mines in the construction of the hitler line emphasis was given 
 to anti tank defences in depth the main anti tank emplacements were traversable 75mm panther and tiger turrets mounted in 
 concrete these positions were protected by numerous two man machine gun posts and mobile anti tank guns on the flank 
 all fixed positions were well built had underground bunkers had excellent fields of fire and were capable of standing up 
 to most shell fire these were the defences against which lieutenant colonel ware was to lead the patricia s may 
 20th to 22nd were confusing and frustrating days for the patricia s they were in location on the right flank 
 for plan one but had to be ready to move quickly to the divisional left flank in support of plan 
 two several times they packed up in preparation for a move only later to be stood down this situation seriously 
 restricted the 2nd brigade in conducting the necessary reconnaissance of the hitler line in the aquino area the limited reconnaissance 
 that was conducted showed to the patricia s that the forme d aquino could complicate the plan of attack the 
 deep trough and steep 
 54 banks of this slow moving stream made it impassable to tanks the stream forced the 2nd brigade through a 
 bottle neck upon which the enemy could concentrate its fire even more important the enemy along the east bank of 
 the stream would have the patricia s in enfilade as they were the extreme right battalion of the divisional attack 
 by midnight on may 22nd word was finally received that plan one would be executed at 0600 hours on may 
 23rd ie in six hours time lieutenant colonel ware assisted by his second in command major d h rosser and 
 adjutant captain r c m gammell made the necessary final preparations for the attack c company commanded by major r 
 b hobson would lead on the left and a company commanded by major w den watson would lead on the 
 right the patricia s battlefield was divided by five report lines each 300 yards apart january february march april and 
 aboukar aboukar was the final objective astride the aquino road at 0557 hours on may 23rd more than 300 guns 
 began laying down a barrage across the attack zone the barrage advanced at a rate of 100 yards every five 
 minutes and it was important for the infantry to keep close behind the barrage at 0600 hours the seaforth and 
 patricia s crossed the start line the enemy was quick to sense the impending attack and as the canadians moved 
 through patches of low growing oaks which partly concealed their early advance the full force of the enemy fire fell 
 on them from front and flank intense mortar fire punctuated with artillery shelling caught them between start line and wire 
 and as our barrage passed german machine gun crews emerged from their deep dugouts and added their vicious burst to 
 the general fusillade on the right the aquino sector was strongly held by the 4th parachute regiment and part of 
 the 3rd many of the early patricia casualties came from the deadly cross fire which swept down the open forme 
 d aquino from the paratroopers on the east bank of the stream at first the patricia s whose axis was 
 on the extreme right where the ground fell sharply away into the forme d aquino made steady progress and within 
 an hour had closed to february at february the ground forced the churchill tanks of the north irish horse into 
 a frontage of only 150 yards it was also here that the tanks encountered an unexpected minefield which completely blocked 
 their path while thus immobilized they came under deadly fire from the 75mm tank guns the tanks were forced to 
 fall back thus leaving the infantry to advance alone throughout the day numerous attempts were made to breach the minefield 
 however work party after work party was decimated by the enemy s direct and indirect fire corporal r armstrong and 
 his pioneer section raised 75 mines whilst under direct enemy fire but a gap could not be completed the tanks 
 also continued to try to get forward but without success altogether 41 of the 58 british tanks engaged on the 
 2nd brigade front were knocked out during the day with the patricia s now separated from their tanks and support 
 weapons and falling further and further behind the friendly barrage they fought their way forward into a shallow gully branching 
 from the main valley of the forme d aquino the two leading companies penetrated the wire in the grainfields beyond 
 but in doing so ran into numerous anti personnel mines and could 
 55 advance no further wounded patricia s were afterwards found well beyond the wire and two days later the battalion 
 welcomed back some 30 able bodied men of the assault companies who had gone to ground in the hitler line 
 when organized forward movement ceased at this point communication failed and the only information reaching lieutenant colonel ware s headquarters 
 came from casualties streaming back with tales of platoons decimated and all officers dead or wounded runners and scouts were 
 sent out but none returned for better tactical control lieutenant colonel ware moved his headquarters to february and took shelter 
 behind a disabled tank he quickly had to move however as the tank was still being engaged by the enemy 
 communications remained poor and lieutenant colonel ware was frequently on the move striving to preserve cohesion amongst his companies time 
 and time again men were struck down around him as he moved about the battlefield although a and c companies 
 had penetrated the wire they could not continue on because of the enemy fire and mines and because of the 
 terrible number of casualties they had suffered b company commanded by captain a m campbell and d company commanded by 
 captain a s ennis smith advancing behind a and c companies eventually reached the wire where they too were brought 
 to a halt by machine guns firing from cupolas at point blank range snipers seemed to be everywhere and further 
 progress was impossible enemy artillery mortar and small arms fire continued to rain down on the pinned down companies from 
 both front and flank and it was impossible for the tanks to come to their assistance the seaforth on the 
 left initially had better success but soon they too were pinned down and could not get forward once the seaforth 
 and patricia advance was stopped the loyal edmonton regiment 4 ppcli commanded by lieutenant colonel r c coleman quickly moved 
 forward in an attempt to pass through and continue onto the final objective after gallant attempts to get forward and 
 after suffering heavy casualties they too were halted by the strong german defences and the murderous direct and indirect fire 
 they never really had a chance as the artillery barrage had long since passed the tanks could still not get 
 forward and little support and information could be provided by the seaforth and patricia companies already pinned down the advance 
 by the 2nd brigade had been halted for the remainder of the day the details of the fighting were confusing 
 only through the personal accounts of the survivors could the story be continued many of the stories now to be 
 repeated were taken from colonel steven s volume 111 of the patricia s regimental history major w den watson who 
 led a company found himself alone on the battlefield as most of his men had been either killed or wounded 
 in an attempt to find his men or other members of the battalion he twice went forward to the battalion 
 objective on the aquino road only to find it occupied by the enemy although wounded in the arm and head 
 he remained in a shell hole in the hitler line and was found still in good spirits the day following 
 the battle 
 56 captain a m campbell who led b company courageously and well was the only officer of the rifle companies 
 still on his feet at the end of the day as officers became casualties the non commissioned officers automatically assumed 
 the command roles company sergeant major w d davidson of b company performed most courageously while under heavy fire he 
 searched for and found a lost platoon stalked and killed two snipers and brought in many of the wounded unfortunately 
 he was killed the following day while bringing in more of the wounded sergeant e d edkins of c company 
 after being wounded twice in the initial advance turned over command of his platoon to a corporal in order to

 command of d company he immediately reorganized it with resolution and skill sergeant f bentham of 14 platoon although wounded 
 and with only two men left continued to attack from shell hole to shell hole and was able to direct 
 the supporting tanks on to enemy machine gun nests corporal f w snell fought a duel in the open in 
 which he killed three snipers when there were no non commissioned officers left in 12 platoon private lan sangster took 
 command rallied the men and led an attack against an enemy tank thereafter for eight hours he and his small 
 group held their ground against heavy shell fire and repeated assaults victory was not to come to the patricia s 
 or the 2nd brigade during the breaching of the hitler line it was however a canadian victory as the 3rd 
 brigade had been successful in breaking through the centre of the line the day s ordeal had cost the 2nd 
 brigade dearly indeed its casualties of 543 162 killed 306 wounded and 75 taken prisoner were unequalled in a single 
 days fighting by any canadian brigade during the entire italian campaign the cost to the patricia s was 3 officers 
 and 55 other ranks killed 5 officers and 157 other ranks wounded 2 officers and 25 other ranks missing immediately 
 after the battle this left the battalion with a fighting strength of only 77 all ranks despite the many acts 
 of valour the fine soldierly bearing endurance discipline and devotion to duty in face of terrible odds victory was denied

 57 second battalion after a six month repose on the island of love the battalion returned to windy winnipeg and 
 a programme of intensive refresher training the cobwebs of cyprus were soon swept away as preparation was made for a 
 hectic summer the month of may was particularly eventful for the unit as it was on the 17th of may 
 that kapyong formerly fort osborne barracks was officially opened a kapyong day parade was held at which colonel j r 
 stone dso mc commanding officer of the battalion at the battle of kapyong was reviewing officer also in attendance was 
 the american consul in winnipeg mr w kelly and his wife the day was rounded out with a formal dinner 
 in the evening still another noteworthy event in may was the attendance by the battalion officers and their wives at 
 a dinner and dance at the residence of the lieutenant governor of manitoba the honourable w j mckeag and mrs 
 mckeag had visited the battalion in cyprus and the function at government house was the official welcome back to winnipeg 
 for the officers of 2 ppcli in the first week of june the unit departed winnipeg for wainwright and ex

 in the cross country race first in softball and first in volleyball and turned in a creditable showing in flag 
 football but it was in the skill at arms competitions that the unit s expertise really asserted itself top marks 
 were obtained by warrant officer chisholm g p in the individual pistol category by sergeant rankin l in the rifle 
 and sniper categories and by private gilfoy w e in the tyro the week of competitions was followed by two 
 weeks of company training which culminated in a week long battalion exercise pork sword this exercise tested the unit in 
 all the phases of war and the results were most satisfactory the conclusion of waincon 73 was by no means 
 the end of unit activity for the summer while some were fortunate enough to take annual leave others remained behind 
 in wainwright or moved further afield to new taskings a and c companies were tasked with supporting milcon 73 the 
 highlight of which was a militia senior tactics course conducted by major g m reay oc a company in banff 
 the national army cadet camp was in full swing with more than a little help from sergeants freeman and newman 
 jones and master corporal slater in richmond 8 c a contingent from the unit rendered valuable assistance in support of

 the other two battalions 3 rcha and the canadian airborne regiment major diebel has since departed winnipeg for a posting

 conducted by c company from which all who took part derived considerable benefit and an escape and evasion course under 
 the auspices of a company the latter was a particularly worthwhile endeavour and included a contingent from the royal winnipeg

 referred to was the investiture of sergeant pokol w as a member of the order of military merit on the 
 19th of september sergeant pokol was cited for his consistently outstanding military performance he joined the battalion in february 1957 
 and served with the battalion airborne company prior to the unit s departure for germany in 1966 sergeant pokol was 
 a top graduate on the u s ranger course in 1965 his ranger training was put to good use in 
 working with a patrol detachment in recce platoon and he has since been employed as battalion transport sergeant and as

 the bth sixty officers and men from the battalion including the corps of drums visited deer lodge veterans hospital they 
 carried out a ward by ward tour bringing greeting poppies and memories of the old army to the resident veterans 
 the visit was a great success and for the veterans ample evidence that the soldiers of today had not forgotten 
 their predecessors contribution to canada and the profession of arms on november 11th a remembrance day parade was held at 
 kapyong barracks the week of 12 to 16 november found the unit out on the st charles range participating in

 the major event of a military nature in december was the combat group commander s inspection on 12 december inclement 
 weather resulted in the formal parade being held in korea hall but even with these limitations brigadier general g g 
 brown was very favourably impressed following the parade general brown watched training demonstrations with a company conducting rappelling b company 
 on the obstacle course in full kit and c company conducting survival swimming in the lipsett hall pool a cocktail 
 party at which general brown was hosted by the battalion officers and their wives was held that evening following the 
 inspection leave began for all those with a few days left on their annual slate while the remainder looked forward 
 to christmas or new year s breaks it was hard to believe that last year at the same time we 
 were making plans to celebrate the festive season in sunny nicosia but perhaps it was not so hard to picture 
 for some those posted from the unit to unef middle east perhaps better known as cairo racetrack had christmas in 
 the sun some of these for the second year in a row among those posted was lieutenant tony stasiewicz and 
 at this time the other unit officers rushed out for crash courses in polish in case more vacancies in the 
 contingent turned up a synopsis of battalion activities would be incomplete without reference to mess activities after a hectic six 
 months the officers mess went to ground for the month of april however after a bit of leave a mixed

 as major h g leitch major g kindle captain d morreau and lieutenant a a e wilson moved on to 
 greener pastures annual leave also took its toll but by the end of august the mess was in action again 
 revealing some new faces and some old fall activities started with a barbeque in august and a mess dinner in 
 early september it was also at this time that our british exchange officer captain p g truman the queen s 
 regiment said good bye to the battalion and returned to duty in england and a tour in northern ireland still 
 another event was the annual sergeants and officers golf tournament somehow the officers couldn t cope with the nineteenth hole 
 informal parties including a disco night and hallowe en highlighted september and october and interspersed were the weekly happy hours 
 which some may remember and other may not the mess moved out to shilo for ten days in october but 
 somehow beer and bunk beds don t mix it was a long fall from the top bunk november culminated in 
 a happy hour in honour of brigadier general c j a hamilton the proceedings of which were referred to earlier 
 the other highlight of the month was a candlelight dinner which included a john wayne duster the highlight of december 
 was a christmas decorating party at the mess and the month was rounded out with a new year s eve 
 ball the ball helped bring to an enjoyable conclusion a very full year of activity activities in the warrant officers 
 and sergeants mess were equally hectic january 1973 found the members of the mess well established in a variety of 
 locations on the island of love the main centre of fellowship being the swan inn under the direction of the 
 pmc mwo alex wilson and managed by that stout and experienced innkeeper sgt art sutton four company messes were established 
 logistics company senior ncos and others enjoyed the friendly atmosphere at blue beret camp under the direction of the pmc 
 wo dave o brien a and b companies dug in firmly at hospitality house and beaver lodge respectively battalion headquarters 
 and headquarters company members enjoyed good times at wolseley barracks under the guidance of rsm jim heyman where the local 
 cypriot help and others still wonder how the interior decorators wo fred breurkens and wo dennis weir conceived their lighting 
 and colour schemes all messes were at home for the new year s levee which really taxed the fortitude of 
 the members who were on the visiting parties which seemed to be everybody remember that crew with the limousine and 
 the haybox of moosemilk the raid on the blues and royals other memorable events include the medals parade cocktail party 
 the officers sergeants mess games night and the barbeque for the lieutenant governor of manitoba in march thoughts turned to 
 rotation and the many associated farewell and welcome parties to be organized 
 79 the mess reconvened in winnipeg during the month of may and held a mixed mess dinner to honour the 
 ladies of the mess who for six months looked after the families and shovelled snow without complaints the official opening 
 of kapyong barracks found many old patricia friends amongst us the guest of honour being our former commanding officer colonel 
 jim stone summer found most mess members at the wainwright resort acquainting and reacquainting ourselves with the members of our 
 sister battalions during the concentration we had the opportunity to introduce a new inter mess trophy for mallet golf this 
 was done in recognition of sgt maxie schulman s many years of service to the mess the contest was enjoyed 
 by all records were established on all tees partly due to the excellent support provided by wos doug preece and 
 joe waluska autumn was the time some of our members went on swans or courses i e sgts glen wallace 
 harry stinson and george arndt off to catch kangeroos in australia wo lyle ransome to germany as umpire at the 
 hofbrauhaus mwo bill colbourne to the mojave desert to observe how the lizards do it and numerous others to cas 
 on courses mess entertainment during this period consisted of a variety of dances bingos etc ending the season with a 
 giant bottle draw dance organized by the pmc and enjoyed by all visitors to the mess will see a big 
 change in the lounge the fireplace is gone due to the excellent efforts of sgts bob lowry ed kingston and 
 bill hodge this provides us with the space needed and new carpeting and furniture will give the lounge an entirely 
 new look whilst still retaining the traditional regimental decor 1973 saw 35 members leave the mess on posting or release 
 with as many being posted or promoted into the mess to those who left us we say thank you for 
 your friendship to those who joined the mess in 1973 welcome you are part of the team the junior ranks 
 club better known as the patricia arms also had a heavy schedule under the able direction of master corporal payment 
 d the pmc the members embarked on a social schedule which gave all the appearances of having been organized by 
 hugh hefner top bands from all over canada put in appearances at various times throughout the year not to mention 
 other exotica and or erotica the new year was rung in with a three band extravaganza attended by a crowd 
 approaching the four figure mark parallels from the past the original per the attached article was forwarded by mr henk

 87 ppcli patrol actions in korea lt m d allan when the patricias arrived in korea in 1950 they found 
 themselves fighting a different kind of war than that which they had been accustomed to in the second world war 
 this was a war of limited aims in fact it was not even classed as a war but rather that 
 of a police action in the war the patricias found themselves fighting mostly defensive battles much time was spent in 
 static positions and this afforded great opportunity for raids and patrolling these patrolling activities at times were quite large and 
 most aggressive the following account is of a patrol which was sent out by the first battalion on the night 
 of the 21 may 1952 the purpose of the patrol was to capture a prisoner the objective was an enemy 
 held hill known as the boot located about 40 miles north of seoul the commander of the patrol was lieutenant 
 d a middleton mc mm along with him he had thirty two men which included two snipers two wireless operators 
 and two pioneers the patrol was split up into three sections a firm base section a covering fire section and 
 a fighting section the fighting section was again split up into a headquarters two sten groups and two bren groups 
 supporting fire for the patrol was to come from a troop of strathconas a troop from ircha and from the 
 battalion mortar and machine gun platoons at 2300 hours the firm base section had established itself on the floor of 
 the nobu ri valley while the main body passed through at midnight the covering fire section reached the base of 
 the hill without encountering the enemy and took up a position 50 yards from the enemy s trenches as the 
 patrol came within twenty yards of the trenches the enemy opened fire with all their weapons at this point five 
 members of the patrol were wounded one of whom was lieutenant middleton the officer was anxious to withdraw to avoid 
 further casualties the second in command corporal j g dunbar quickly organized the recovery of the wounded in due course 
 the patrol returned to their positions the patrol was not a complete loss however as seven of the enemy were 
 estimated to have been killed or wounded as patrols such as the one just mentioned continued the enemy became more 
 aware of the patricia s tactics he learned to anticipate their actions and it became increasingly difficult to capture prisoners 
 many times when a patrol was given artillery support to soften up a position they found that the trenches were 
 empty when they arrived and that the enemy had withdrawn to alternate positions where they could fire on the patrol 
 large patrols were very useful in korea in harassing the enemy and gaining valuable information as the following will certainly 
 testify 
 88 on august 22 1951 the patricias embarked on a series of deep patrols in the territory beyond the imjin 
 river to a depth of several miles at nesan myon four miles beyond the crossing their vehicles turned back and 
 the rifle companies continued on foot a firm base was established at sochang ni 2500 yards beyond mesan myon and 
 at 0200 hours the next morning c and d companies abreast took off on a sweep of the rolling ridges 
 towards the samichon river at noon when the other companies had taken the lead they drew fire from a village 
 when canadian artillery replied an enemy force estimated at company strength broke from cover and fled into the west wheeling 
 north b company continued for a further 2000 yards to the point of deepest penetration of the patrol en route 
 it came upon an enemy camp that had been evacuated within a matter of minutes half cooked meals being found 
 on the fires the patricias now were about four miles to the northwest of mesan myon and about twelve miles 
 from the imjin crossing as evening fell and the companies began to withdraw the enemy could be seen re occupying 
 positions deserted earlier in the afternoon the battalion did not return by the outward route but headed due south to 
 the imjin where mortars and machine guns had taken up positions on the opposite bank to cover an overnight bivouac 
 next morning the patricias remained in this location to observe the effects of an air strike on targets that they 
 had indicated that evening the companies independently crossed the river and embussed for return to camp 1 patrols were conducted 
 to gather intelligence harass the enemy and dominate no man s land as already mentioned there was considerable danger when 
 the patrols got close to the enemy lines there was also considerable danger when moving through no man s land 
 the north koreans and more particularly the chinese also sent out numerous patrols patrols had to move with great caution 
 and stealth to avoid contact with the enemy patrols and avoid being ambushed even with such caution contact between patrols 
 did occur frequently causing casualties to both sides this was the real test for all members of the patrol as 
 everyone had to react immediately without orders from the patrol commander the patrol action on such encounters was probably the 
 most important aspect to be included in the detailed patrol orders and rehearsals casualties were also incurred which could not 
 be attributed to enemy actions on january 15 1952 a patrol from a company first battalion had completed its mission 
 and was nearing home when it strayed onto a protective minefield sergeant r g sorsdahl led a stretcher party onto 
 the minefield in removing the injured another mine was tripped killing one man on a stretcher and seriously injuring others 
 including sergeant sorsdahl total casualties in this unfortunate incident were two killed and four wounded 2 accidents such as this 
 fortunately were not common and it never lessened the appetite that the patricias had for patrolling 
 89 as the war continued the art of patrolling became a specialized field and the patricia s techniques became the 
 model for patrol training in later years there were standing patrols fighting patrols and reconnaissance patrols all of these played 
 a significant part in the success of further major battles patricia fighting patrols had difficulty in achieving surprise the chinese 
 defenses were well protected and their surveillance system must have been excellent as the following testifies on the night of 
 20 june 1952 a b company patrol of the first battalion was sent out to provide firm base positions the 
 patrol was led by lieutenant a p bull the patrol crossed a small valley and began climbing onto higher ground 
 they started to shake out into assault formation and as they were doing so a series of explosions started around 
 them lieutenant bull was wounded in this incident but he was able to withdraw his men of the 37 men 
 which started the patrol seven men were killed and fifteen wounded lieutenant bull later said that he did not know 
 what hit them it is impossible to say what hit us it may have been souped up mortars or grenades 
 bangalor torpedoes bouncing betty mines fougasse weapons but to this list it would be well to add etc etc 3 
 it was lucky that the patricias had a sense of humour such as this for without it this already dirty 
 and ugly war could have been a lot harder on them as was mentioned before even with seemingly disasterous incidents 
 such as the ones previously mentioned the patricias continued to press on as chinese resistance to patrolling grew so did

 91 third battalion civic action we all know that an infantryman s job is to close with and destroy the 
 enemy however we at work point have found some pleasure in moonlighting at civic action projects and associated activities for 
 a long time now many of us have had the good fortune to help those children less fortunate than most 
 through working with the g r pearkes clinic for handicapped children our association with the g r pearkes clinic has 
 gone deeper than soldiers being drafted for odd jobs most weekends a group of soldiers volunteer their time to work 
 with these kids every november during united appeal time many of our soldiers specifically request that their donation be directed 
 to the pearkes clinic a recent incident at work point sums up most soldiers feelings a corporal was sitting in 
 the junior ranks club muttering over a beer that he had been assigned to guide some handicapped children around the 
 area two hours later after helping a retarded boy climb over an armoured personnel carrier this same corporal sat in 
 the jrc and could only say christ those poor kids one reason perhaps that the unit soldiers contributed 6 421 
 00 to the united appeal 3rd battalion mascot ace manchu kijik then and now b company presented the battalion with 
 a little insignificant white ball of fur upon its return from ex ace card vi in feb 73 however by 
 year s end ace was no longer little or insignificant 
 92 work point barracks victoria british columbia 31 december 1973 national defence headquarters ottawa mainland dear minister of national defence 
 i think it is high time that you were made aware of what s goin on in 3 princess patricias 
 canadian light infantry obviously no one s told you or you would sort this place out first off let s 
 forget about winter warfare that s why people emigrate to vancouver island to avoid the cold but what do we 
 do why last january they had us up down the island trying to find snow to refresh us in winter 
 warfare worse they then shipped us off to camp wainwright where we didn t have to look for cold and 
 snow in 1973 74 is it really necessary for us to pull tobaggans live in tents or snow caves attack 
 this defend that when even the eskimos live in houses and drive skidoos havin sharpened our skills for winter operations 
 naturally enough we advanced that to do internal security training that s a misnomer it s like saturday nite in 
 sydney noise smoke gas and unmentionable items being splattered all over the place you should get rid of these rowdies 
 from the forces on the other hand maybe its better to keep them hidden here the biggest chuckle here came 
 when they blew up battalion headquarters not that it made any difference this place seems to run by inertia after 
 this you d figure we d coast for a while that s a laugh we had guys from charlie company 
 up north rescuing fossils apc training field firing and what is loosely termed refresher training off again to wainwright for 
 waincon at least this year we had some useful low level training but you should keep an eye on these 
 company commanders you know the type all phases of war in one morning advance dig in patrol defend and withdraw 
 all before lunch some of the guys back east of the rockies where the garbage cans freeze in october figure 
 we ve got it soft here in paradise well we whomped the whole crew during the waincon sports weapons and 
 field competitions obviously even to you after this strenuous effort we should have been packed off on leave nothing doin 
 your minions have to keep us moving we had guys ricocheting all over the island and even on the mainland 
 student summer employment plan militia jeux canada games you name it and there were 3 ppcli reps there in the 
 midst of all this lieutenant colonel dick cowling replaced lieutenant colonel phil roy another damned parade jeux canada games reminds 
 me of a headline by time magazine after an insignificant pub during ex nasty deal but did time feature us 
 for doing the driving guarding bull labour communicating and co ordinating for the games not in your life i guess 
 the moral is that pub raiders should wear jeux canada games sweatshirts probably no one would notice them 
 93 ex queen s ransom i don t think cpl parker that the co had that in mind when he 
 said to build snow defences finally most of us slipped away of leave and managed to flesh out our wasted 
 frames with a few extra pounds but then the new commanding officer starts an hour of physical education a day 
 is that fair it took me a month of downing the fruit of hops to acquire that comfortable feeling and 
 now i m a skinney wretch again having survived this all of us were packed off in a series of 
 courses until december but the officers and senior nco s felt left out so they spent their time concocting weird 
 schemes so as soon as the courses ended zot off we went to san diego by ship why not fly 
 can t we afford it patrol exercises and now back to roaming vancouver island in the rain looking for snow 
 don t they ever learn and for 74 things look worse amphibious exercises more of wainwright a trooping and etc 
 where will it all end i mentioned all of this to my section commander mcpl lovet but he said i 
 should go to the top since he couldn t change it unfortunately the rsm was out so you seemed a 
 fair second choice should you require more guidance just give me a call don t worry i ll fit you

 94 warrant officers and sergeants mess the heading of this article may appear to the reader to be a relatively 
 common line of print but to the regular associate and honorary members of the mess it is anything but ordinary 
 after ten months of work worry headaches arguments pleadings and an incredible amount of support from all across the country 
 3 ppcli once again has a warrant officers and sergeants mess at 1500 hours friday 14 december 1973 all regular 
 members lined the sidewalk from the street to the mess entrance the yip party arrived on the dot as planned 
 major general cameron b ware dso cd colonel of the regiment and lieutenant colonel r l cowling cd commanding officer 
 of the battalion held the ribbon taut captain n g h hayes dsc cd base commander cfb esquimau cut the 
 ribbon the mess was officially open many traditional items beyond value and irreplaceable were lost when the old mess burned 
 in february 73 trophies silver photographs souvernirs and momentos were all reduced to ashes the membership moved into a temporary 
 mess and called for assistance in rebuilding the response was beyond expectation furniture was loaned for the temporary mess trophies 
 were donated photographs were reproduced and forwarded the base commander threw his weight behind the task of obtaining a new 
 building for the permanent mess people in ottawa expedited paperwork local merchants donated trophies above all the members supported the 
 entire effort by attending the temporary mess and backing their committees to all who helped we say thank you you 
 are too numerous to mention individually but you are remembered and there is a line in the guest register reserved 
 for you we hope you will make early and frequent use of it the cutting of the ribbon was the 
 beginning of an opening celebration that lasted the weekend for two hours after the doors opened all members hosted the 
 dignitaries in the new lounge that evening saw a formal mess dinner with the colonel of the regiment as guest 
 of honour the gathering which followed the dinner must have been a memorable one the only person who is able 
 to state definitely what time it ended is the mess manager he claims he got home in time for breakfast 
 on saturday morning the ladies were introduced to the new mess on saturday afternoon at an informal cocktail party and 
 on saturday night the first social function another late night for one and all but a 4 a m closing 
 time is generally considered to be an indication of a good bash as always when we talk the mess we 
 are talking people our people have been doing things also having things done to them most of you are familiar 
 with military format so i think i ll just list them alphabetically by rank and tack on what happened to 
 them chief warrant officer regimental sergeant major poncho fotheringham clearing for release as this is being written there is no

 97 for obvious reasons social functions were at a minimum during the past year there are however two events which 
 we feel cannot be passed without mention in june 1973 during waicon 3 ppcli worked to its normal standards and 
 swept the field at the combat group competitions now this is cause for celebrations in the mess an informal before 
 supper gathering turned into an all night jam session music was provided by master warrant officer father roy bruce and 
 his eighty spoon band guest soloists included master warrant officer slimjim peety on the washboard and tonsils fenton as featured 
 vocalist the affair was mcd by the regimental sergeant major at least we think that s what he was doing 
 the combat group commander brigadier general gg brown dropped in for a few moments early in the evening and ended 
 up staying till dawn as guest conductor of the spoon band something may have been lacking in the decor but 
 one gallon of enthusiasm and spirit per member sure made up for it it was one hell of a good 
 party again we offer our congrats and condolences to the hi lo scorers of the annual kkrc shoot this year 
 the competition has been modified with ppcli shooting in one class and corps personnel in another we congratulate warrant officer 
 pat devlin infantry high and sergeant clyde ells corps high we sympathize with sergeant al wardell and warrant officer ed 
 pankew who won the low score infantry spoon and corps fork respectively one sad note before we close mr c

 july 1973 he left behind good memories and a lot of good friends he is remembered and missed yup must

 98 catch weight tug of war champions preparing to enjoy the spoils are the members of the third battalion catch 
 weight tug of war team which won the event during the sports meet held during waincon 73 waincon 73 forced 
 march winners being cheered on by their battalion is the forced march platoon from d company commanded by lt mike 
 loewen which out distanced all other combat group competitors to win the event held during waincon 73 
 99 ex nasty deal during the last week of march 1973 funny looking characters began to appear on the streets 
 around work point naden and the infamous tudor house their presence signalled the start of what is fondly remember as 
 ex nasty deal patrolling started and reports of suspicious characters began almost immediately meanwhile those not on patrols were able 
 to find themselves a nice comfortable piece of the concrete floor in the naden drill hall and were soon sound 
 asleep you can always tell who the veterans are they are the first to fall asleep under the worst conditions 
 on one occasion a patrol led by sgt jigger johnston came across a crew of civilians busily digging holes along 
 the water front somehow this didn t quite seem right identification and work permit were asked for but couldn t 
 be produced consequently in the true spirit of the exercise pte bradley marched his five foot nothing body over to 
 the foreman big hans alias man mountain and arrested him big hans was then marched under escort to capt dave 
 lewis c coy comd to deal with as he saw fit one thing led to another and well to make 
 a long story short we enjoyed reading about it in the paper the next day although it was only an 
 exercise nasty deal somehow managed to get a great deal of publicity capt ron bragden of tudor house fame even 
 made time magazine but enough said about that one thing about ex nasty deal when you weren t working or 
 sleeping you could always climb onto the rocks overlooking the hospital operating room and watch as some anchor clanker was 
 cut open while this pastime was not really conductive to good eating it was interesting it s always the good 
 times and the funny incidents that are remembered after an exercise and we all remember nasty deal militia assistance 1973 
 every year a great deal of effort and time is directed by the battalion towards training and assisting reserve units 
 in the pacific area and 1973 was no exception exercise queens ransom held in wainwright in january began this year 
 s assistance program where 7 militia personnel were attached to the battalion for winter warfare training these personnel were integrated 
 within the rifle sections to learn and practice the finer arts of winter warfare with subjects ranging from tent routine 
 march discipline to snow shakes and the yellow snow plague later throughout march april the unit dispatched briefing teams to 
 the canadian scottish regiment the royal westminister regiment and the 15th bc field battery the teams conducted courses on armoured 
 defence and first aid with b company providing an internal security demonstration for the captain qualifying course 
 100 unit refresher trg the week of 10 17 sep saw the battalion involved in its annual first aid refresher 
 training held at albert head using simulated but realistic situations like the car accident above personnel involved requalified themselves 0:them 
 0:selves in basic first aid techniques following the annual leave period unit assistance continued when on the bth of september 
 a team under the command of sergeant b johnston went to the port alberni fall fair there a static display 
 which included winter warfare equipment and a scottish regiment the teams fine work in planning and preparation won the praise 
 of many including the mayor of port alberni the last major militia assistance during 1973 and undertaken by captain mike 
 gentles was a series of one day briefings to the four major reserve units in the area the briefing team 
 provided professional assistance on new equipment in use within a regular force battalion today which may be unfamiliar to reserve 
 units the briefing included a cloth model exercise a brief resume of iccs operations was given by captain pat dillon 
 who recently returned from viet nam included also was a display and lecture of is and ir equipment and the 
 new family of radios which was given by master corporal luscombe and master corporal homer sergeant stewart and corporal cloutier 
 assisted in the briefings the last given on the 9th of december ending the battalion support to the reserves forces 
 for this fiscal year but who knows what 1974 will bring 
 101 junior ranks club hello again from all members of the 3 ppcli junior ranks club as far as the 
 committee goes just a minor change cpl robinson was posted back to a ship leaving cpl jerry bestwich handling the 
 secretary duties since last issue the club has had a successful and busy year during the summer it was ssep 
 and milcon plus our old favourite waincon the club provided a mess for each concentration ssep was in albert head 
 and milcon and waincon were established in wainwright the summer also saw the lounge closed for resurfacing of our hardwood 
 floors the fall has been busy to date with week end dances since september plus game nights autumn also saw 
 the jrc sports teams back to life to bring you up to date last year our hockey team was defeated 
 losing its last playoff game but they went down fighting this year the team is back at it and after 
 a season opening loss have stayed on a winning streak this year there is no room for losses because the 
 winner takes all fall has found the mess supporting two new teams broomball and darts broomball is suffering growing pains 
 but the team is maintaining a respectable third place in a six team league and with high spirits is very 
 optimistic about the play offs as for the dart league competition is keen with all of the legions involved the 
 flights as the team is called are improving however the biggest sports event of the fall came on 23 nov 
 73 when the golden running shoe competition was held it brought together the local thistle jumpers officers and snr ncos 
 versus the meat stompers junior ranks club in a flag football game the weather and field conditions were less than 
 ideal it is said that the commanding officer and padre had a conference the morning of the game to discuss 
 the playing conditions obviously the padre backed the junior ranks club but the official kick off by the colonel of 
 the regiment mgen cb ware dso cd went off on schedule once underway it was a very evenly matched event 
 with no score until the final quarter this saw the junior ranks club score a touch down on a running 
 play by the hero of the game corporal dave dougan a bad snap by corporal jerry bestwick caused master corporal 
 gerry joyal to run and slide for the point the game ended with the junior ranks club on top 7 
 0 next year promises to be as active as 73 and hopefully as enjoyable best wishes from the junior ranks

 103 3 ppcli marksmanship this year s competitive effort in the marksmanship department produced some significant firsts as well as 
 proving that with good selection and training young shooters can be brought to a competitive level in the first year 
 however when faced with the task of meeting a second team on a strange range the difficulty often is too 
 high after spring training the team faced its first challenge in wainwright by defeating the rest of the 1 cbt 
 group in the team pistol and rifle events despite a strong effort by 1 ppcli who were well ahead at 
 one time the team rallied to win the rifle championship in the team events a team of master warrant officer 
 debruyne warrant officer zwolak and corporal simpson won the vancouver c company bird match a team won the falling plate 
 competition while private menzel distinguished himself by winning the tyro championship after this competition the team returned to victoria and 
 participated in the bcra winning the services team match sergeant king was particularly effective as he won five first places 
 following this and a two week leave period training resumed with the final phase being done in calgary and then 
 it was to connaught ranges in ottawa by hercules the national competition was significant in that it was the best 
 performance by a rifle team from this unit the vanier trophy was lost by only 2vi points as well as 
 finishing third in the bisley aggregate an lar team of corporal luscumbe corporal carlson 3 ppcli and corporal murray from 
 1 ppcli completely dominated the lar matches by winning three out of four matches and coming second in the fourth 
 despite stoppages truly a job well done a significant factor was the performance of our first year shooters who performed 
 better than the tyros from any other command team this suggests we are on the right track the final competition 
 was fired at heals range during the pacific coast rifle association matches shot in september aside from winning the team 
 events master corporal cruickshank dominated the individual category by winning several matches including the service rifle aggregate other match winners 
 were corporal carlson private mclnerney and sergeant king most regrettable was the departure of master warrant officer debruyne to germany

 113 patricia representation in vietnam as a result of canada s agreement to participate in the international commission for control 
 and supervision in viet nam iccs some 240 military personnel were committed to serve in the military component canadian delegation 
 which included 14 patricia officers who served in locations from quang tri in the north to vi thanh in the 
 south the strengths of the national delegations were stipulated in the protocols to the paris agreement concerning the iccs and 
 the four parties canadians hungarians indonesians and poles chip were limited to a total of 290 delegates composed of both 
 military and political the ratio of personnel within the canadian delegation jelled into an approximate 240 50 split with department 
 of external affairs dea the military contingent canadian delegation which numbered some 150 all ranks a dea party which included 
 ambassador michel gauvin head of the canadian delegation and a press party departed montreal on 27 jan 73 after a 
 send off the like of which had not been seen since the departure of canadian troops to participate in world 
 war 11 after a twenty seven hour flight via alaska and japan a groggy first draft arrived at saigon s 
 tan san nhut airbase at 0320 hours 29 jun 73 and within four hours the canadian hq opened for business 
 in the infamous 1300 lines at the airbase the second draft arrived in mid february bringing the contingent up to 
 strength and by which time mccd had established the basic mechanism for the operation of iccs in accordance with the 
 paris agreement and protocols south viet nam was divided into seven iccs regions numbered consecutively from north to south plus 
 the saigon ghia dinh region which encompassed the area around the south vietnamese capital in addition to the seven regional 
 hqs there were a total of twenty six sub regional teams plus twelve teams located at potential points of entry 
 poe of restricted war material poe teams at gio linh and vung tau were to be staffed by one additional 
 officer due to extensive use of interpreters by the poles all team sites were over staffed by the polish contingent 
 despite the fact that the composition and siting was decreed in the protocol concerning the iccs during the initial stages 
 of operations to end of march 73 the iccs reported to the four party joint military commission fpjmc composed of 
 the united states democratic republic of viet nam republic of viet nam rvn and the provisional revoluntionary government of the 
 republic of viet nam viet cong the two party joint military commission tpjmc of rvn and viet cong succeeded the 
 fpjmc and was generally ineffective due to procedural difficulties throughout our stay in south viet nam the rvn and the 
 viet cong continued to have few points of agreement at the conference table which resulted in the failure of the 
 civil detainee releases and the complete failure of the viet cong delegation to deploy in accordance with the paris agreement 
 
 114 the viet cong failed to use the iccs as an agency to register complaints and of a total of 
 1081 incidents registered with the iccs 1039 complaints were rvn initiated only 38 were registered by the viet cong with 
 four complaints being lodged by both parties the inherent failure of both the fpjmc and the tpjmc to deploy and 
 function in accordance with the terms of the agreement contributed greatly to the inability of the iccs to function successfully 
 this was a supporting factor in the ultimate decision of the canadian government to withdraw the mccd from viet nam 
 under hq mccd which was based throughout in tan san nhut airbase saigon were the saigon ghia dinh region seven 
 prisoner of war civilian detainee pw cd exchange teams plus five special teams available for assignment to additonal poe or 
 other tasks as required these personnel were utilized to beef up the hq where required and in fact were employed 
 at two additional poe sites at camranh bay and saigon new port and tan san nhut airbase despite the obvious 
 frustrations in dealing with the polegarians and the lack of cooperation of the north vietnamese viet cong it was the 
 canadians who developed cajoled and deployed the iccs for the most part in accordance with the dates stipulated by the 
 paris agreement and who devised the investigative machinery of the iccs the commander mccd mgen duncan a mcalpine was responsible 
 for the military aspects of the mission and the ambassador and his staff the political in effect this was an 
 entirely new venture in peacekeeping with the military being in support of the political element the military committee composed of 
 four chip senior military advisors were responsible to the commissioners the four chip heads of delegations ambassadors rotated chairmanship of 
 the iccs on a monthly basis in the c h i p order the housekeeping agency of the iccs was 
 eventually to be the secretariat under the director general however up to the time of our departure the secretariat to 
 which all four nations contributed plus locally hired third party nationals was barely effective the housekeeping continued to devolve on 
 the canadian support services who had initiated all the contracts provision of equipment food transportation etc for the iccs and 
 were hard pressed to divorce themselves from this function iccs air service operation remained a sole canadian responsibility from inception 
 to departure chairmanship within the various regions and team sites rotated in the c h i p order on a 
 weekly basis and this rapid and continuous change complicated the canadians and indonesian efforts to create an effective and objective 
 commission some of the team sites which were located over the 650 mile length of south viet nam were never 
 occupied or occupied only for short periods gio linh and lao bao in viet cong territory in region i were 
 never staffed due to imposition of unacceptable terms for occupancy insisted on by the viet cong this latter site was

 and reoccupied by canadians on 16 jun followed reluctantly by the other delegations on 2 jul 73 some twenty incidents 
 of firing on iccs helicopters occurred during our stay in the republic of viet nam unfortunately one such incident was 
 fatal where a total of nine persons were killed including capt c e laviolette many other incidents occurred throughout the 
 length and breadth of south viet nam including mine explosions mortaring shelling rocket attacks and rifle shots the canadians and 
 the iccs as a whole were fortunate that no casualties resulted from these occurrences and even the saigon based warriors 
 failed to be damaged from the hetrogeneous traffic in downtown saigon no one to our knowledge fell off a honda

 region 111 and were deployed in the central highlands and by the white sand beaches of the south china seacoast 
 these officers were major derek bamford major john bishop who on his return to canada apr 73 to become dco

 a late arrival region 111 team members were rotated throughout their various team sites over the nearly six month period 
 due to this fortunate concentration the region 111 patricias were able to gather in pleiku on 17 mar 73 for

 were hosted at this function our northern representative was capt dune wain who served in region i hue and was

 123 the loyal edmonton regiment 4 ppcli in early september of 1972 we received a visit from the ist battalion 
 queen s lancashire regiment colonel o meara and representatives from all ranks were treated to a bar b que at 
 camp harris and sightseeing in the edmonton area the queen s lancashire regiment reciprocated by allowing fourteen all ranks to 
 attend exercise ramilles in the suffield training area from 21 24 september upon returning to the unit our personnel were 
 all proudly displaying the camouflage uniforms which they somehow managed to obtain while away there was the usual annual district 
 range qualifications in wainwright in october during which unit personnel functioned as the majority of the range personnel on all 
 ranges on 18 november exercise winter warning was held to introduce and prepare for the annual winter warfare training the 
 winter training culminated in exercise snow trek vii in the wabamum area from 12 to 14th january 1973 many tall 
 tales can be told of the exercise and some of the extra curricular activities during the same time as the 
 winter training was in progress sgt chris atkin qualified as a parachutist chris was one of five militia members from 
 all across canada allowed on this regular force course exercise white hair a one day exercise not emphasizing winter warfare 
 took place on 24 february 1973 with good participation by all ranks despite miserable weather conditions from january to may 
 a pay level c course was run for the cwac members of the unit and some recent arrivals from district 
 s fall recruit course also during this time permission was obtained to run a jump course for members of the 
 unit strictly a militia course which was run to regular force standards nineteen members of the unit completed the course 
 with a pass and only one member failed to complete the course he requested to be returned to unit due 
 to university examinations personnel from the airborne training centre commented at the conclusion of the course that they had never 
 seen a serial go through the course with such enthusiasm cohesiveness cooperation and drive in performing all aspects of this 
 training the spring of the year was as usual overloaded with exercises on 10 11 march members of the unit 
 travelled to calgary to take part in exercise burma road an exercise to prepare for the annual mobile command concentration 
 exercise shoot out and red fox both took place from 4 6 may involving range qualifications and final exercise for 
 the pay level c course from 25 27 may exercise spring test was the annual district preparation for the mobile 
 command concentration colonel quarton visited the queen s lancashire regiment in late spring and was graciously received at the regimental 
 mess dinner in london as well as at the king s division depot at strensall 
 124 during the summer unit personnel took part in the mobile command concentration many went on area rank and trades 
 school arts courses in wainwright and borden and several were used as instructors on the student summer employment program in 
 edmonton seven other ranks from the unit took part in fly over training to germany from may to october resulting 
 in many more looking forward to such opportunities in the new year the new training year started in september with 
 the updating of training records and immediate preparations for a reunion of the ppcli and 49th battalion loyal edmonton regiment 
 associations the reunion filled an entire weekend from friday afternoon on the 14th of september until late sunday afternoon on 
 the 16th the dances parties balls museum tours informal gatherings official meetings freedom of the city parade and church parade 
 were attended by members and ex members from all across canada although it meant a great deal of work for 
 all ranks it was a pleasure to see the events so well attended following closely on the heels of this 
 great gathering was the annual district range classification again requiring most of our personnel to be used to run ranges 
 for the benefit of the remainder of the district since these range qualifications do not meet the requirment for infantry 
 units it means we must qualify properly again in the spring starting in mid october unarmed combat swimming and pay 
 level c courses have been in progress aided by special demonstrations from the airborne regiment unarmed combat team and wo 
 bert reed the new regular support staff posted to the unit the unarmed combat and swimming courses are going great 
 guns at present planning and preparation is in full swing for three week end winter training exercise in january a 
 concerted recruiting drive and updating of training standards to fit the militia s new roles it looks like a full

 125 regimental band a brief history princess patricia s canadian light infantry band wo wt smith and cpl ja mackie 
 during the period of time between the 11th and the 18th of august 1914 the period of recruitment for princess 
 patricia s canadian light infantry the following event is purported to have taken place in the ottawa railway station lieutenant 
 colonel fd farquhar commanding officer designate spent a great deal of time at the railway station meeting the trains arriving 
 from literally every corner of the country and filled with volunteers for the regiment on one occasion a pipe major 
 j colville by name outfitted in full highland regalia presented himself to the colonel and expressed his desire to pipe 
 the regiment to france and back again presumably the colonel commented that it was a fine idea and that the 
 pipe major was more than welcome to join the regiment the pipe major reportedly then turned about and let go 
 with a stentorian bellow in his strong scottish brogue which produced from one of the coaches the entire edmonton pipe 
 band wearing full highland kit and the hunting stewart tartan given to them with their pipes by the st andrew 
 s society of edmonton thus was acquired the first band in the regiment the first brass and reed band a 
 volunteer band was formed in november 1917 under the leadership of wol williams when he was killed in action the 
 band was taken over by his brother b sgt williams the princess patricia s canadian light infantry band was formed 
 in 1919 under capt tw james and was made up almost exclusively of musicians from the british and colonial regiments 
 five years later they performed at the british empire exhibition and in london theatres and europe s largest radio station 
 at that time the savoy hill radio station they also received personal congratulations from their majesties king george v and 
 queen mary during the 20 s and 30 s the band stationed at fort osborne barracks winnipeg was kept busy 
 with tours of the west and performances at exhibitions etc in 1939 capt james retired and the band carried on 
 under sgt simpson later in 1939 wol streeter later to become chief inspector of bands was appointed bandmaster promoted to 
 lieutenant and shortly after it was sent overseas the band then came under the direction of sgt butler and became 
 known as the al6 band fort osborne barracks wearing ppcli shoulder flashes later the band was taken over by wol 
 bob sumner until disbandment the canadian permanent force was established in 1949 and in 1950 sgt j mcculloch was selected 
 to re establish the ppcli band and was promoted to wol in 1951 lt a l brown newly graduated from 
 the royal military 
 126 school of music kneller hall england was appointed director of music only 20 strong the band was posted to 
 camp wainwright the staging area for korea concerts parades shows and travel between wainwright vancouver and seattle kept the band 
 very busy 1953 saw the band off to korea a highlight was a week in tokyo while a frantic search 
 was carried out for their instruments lost in shipping en route while in korea the band was kept busy with 
 a series of concerts parades and entertaining canadians and troops of other countries they also took part in the coronation 
 ceremonies with troops of the commonwealth brigade back in japan the band played at the un headquarters in tokyo the 
 ernie pyle theatre and massed concerts with the tokyo police band one of which drew a crowd of 25 000

 the colour with the reviewing officer being lady patricia ramsay colonel in chief with the first battalion second battalion and

 empire games in vancouver the band was to witness the breaking of many athletic records may of 1955 the band 
 rsm was posted and replaced by then wo2 eberts a busy year it included everything from massed tattoos in vancouver 
 to entertaining troops and dependants in whitehorse to performances throughout alberta new year s day of 1957 brought a change 
 of command as capt mcleod left to form the ldsh rc band and lt h jeffrey arrived from the royal 
 military school of music kneller hall the band sailed for europe in september and a busy two year tour of 
 duty with the canadian brigade in germany the first big engagement was a guard of honour and state ball for 
 queen elizabeth and prince philip in holland the next was the tenth anniversary of the north america treaty organization with 
 other bands in mainz germany the first visit by a canadian band to the united nations emergency force middle east 
 involving shows and concerts every day was gruelling but enjoyable a rest back in soest lasted all of one day 
 when the band found they were to take part in the royal tournament in london another first for a canadian 
 band back in germany the band found two troopings waiting for them one for the r22r entirely in french and 
 one for a belgique unit entirely in flemish all the above of course was fitted in around normal band duties 
 the band returned to canada in october 1959 to the new home station hamilton gault barracks edmonton in may 1964 
 they said goodbye to rsm eberts capt jeffery became command inspector of bands and the baton was taken over by 
 lt g c naylor in august wol adams was posted to the band they were kept busy at this time 
 with refresher training depot parades concerts etc october of 1965 saw wol adams retire to civilian life and being replaced 
 by wol heathcote until november of 1966 when he was retired to pension 
 127 centennial year 1967 was probably the busiest in the band s history it took part in the grand national 
 tattoo in victoria vancouver and at expo in montreal back in edmonton they landed in the alberta tattoo which took 
 the band into every corner of alberta covering some 7 000 miles cwo p murray arrived at this time and 
 is still the band cwo in september of 1968 the band travelled to los angeles performed at disney land and 
 then went on to twenty nine palms for a tattoo with the united states marine corps the commanding general general 
 fuller presented all the members with certificates making them honorary twenty nine palms marines and honorary desert rats a change 
 in armed forces policy reduced the number of canadian bands and the ppcli were amalgamated with the lord strathcona s 
 horse rc band in calgary but fortunately retained the ppcli name capt naylor was posted to the canadian forces school 
 of music and the band arrived in calgary and met their new commanding officer capt p metcalfe and his assistant 
 capt j dowell they also inherited another chief warrant officer from the straths cwo t evans almost immediately the band 
 embarked on a busy schedule of school concerts mess dinners and other official functions added to this were trips to 
 inuvik yellowknife and whitehorse the band returned to europe in 1969 for a two month tour playing for parades concerts 
 and mess dinners on the return to calgary capt metcalfe retired to civilian life and capt dowell became the commanding

 festival in kaiserslauten where the band was a particular success back in canada again and the usual base activities school 
 and public concerts the band video taped a remembrance day service they wound up the year by completing tapes for 
 a long playing record which will soon be available to interested persons i suppose the best way to close this 
 history would be to not close it at all but to ask the question where to from here for men

 this our diamond jubilee year 1973 has been a busy year for all ranks of 3 canadian mechanized commando including 
 approximately 162 who are primarily patricias this is just a brief report on some of the highlights the greatest events 
 of the past twelve months center around our colours the start of the activity was the presentation of colours to 
 the canadian airborne regiment on the 9th of june by his honour the lieutenant governor of the province of alberta 
 dr jw grant macewan in edmonton patricias who were present in 3 mechanized commando s colour party were captain el 
 markell master warrant officer vj ramsbottom and sergeant wf easton lieutenant colonel ag christie cd commanding officer 3 canadian mechanized

 the regimental colour in the first mechanized infantry trooping to ever have been performed proudly carrying the colour was captain 
 jd joly formerly 2 ppcli lieutenant general sc waters cd colonel of the canadian airborne regiment took the salute during

 canadian parachute battalion and the first canadian special service force association following quickly on the heels of the trooping on 
 the 6th of july command of the commando changed from lcol christie to lcol md barr cd another event of

 visit to patricia crater by the patricia personnel in the guard the ceremonies honouring all the canadians who fought in 
 the first world war were most impressive and moving the whole trip was made most meaningful by a visit to 
 patricia crater there were many other events in the past twelve months we have been soldiering on as in the 
 past going through all our normal training phases and as usual the commando has been a busy and successful unit 
 looking forward we all hope for another year even more exciting than the one just passed the patricias of 3 
 commando especially anticipate the celebrations presently being planned for our own march 17th some of us hope to return to

 135 the royal green jackets all three of our regular battalions saw service on duties in aid of lie civil 
 authorities in northern ireland during i l2 the ist battalion stationed at elle in germany was on duty in belfast 
 from july until november the 2nd battalion already stationed in northern ireland at limavady was ol course mv re throughout 
 and the 3rd battalion which was reforming at shocbiiryness was in belfast from august only about seven months after il 
 rebirth from lisbandment nnlil december so during part of august september october and part of november all three of them 
 were there in the thick of it snipers bombers brickbats the lot and plenty of rain too to be sure 
 but in this report it is only possible in give the barest outline of all that happened starting with the 
 2nd battalion as they were already there alter lour successful battalion internal security operations into the bogsidc and reggan districts 
 towards the end of l 7l the 2nd battalion look over responsibilities in support of the royal ulster constabulary covering 
 most of county londonderry and pari ol omity antrim i king every soi l of patrol on loot iii vehicles 
 ill boats on loch ncagh and of course in helicopters the liallalion managed to keep fairly quiet a large and 
 traditionally hard area parts ol which have a history of i r a activity in doing so perhaps the greatest 
 success was when a patrol dropped in the hills by helicopter surprised an i r a man in an ambush 
 position actually holding the plunger of a bomb he gol 10 years apart from these activities the battalion was involved 
 in two major civil rights inspired incidents both early in the year first the magilligan march m which the battalion 
 succssfully repelled an invasion by well over a thousand civil rights marchers who advanced on and attempted to get into 
 the magilligan internment amp some of the crowd which approached along the beach managed o surge through a gap between 
 he end of he perimeter wire and the sea at low tide but ihese were routed by a volley of 
 baton rounds and a baton charge a week later a company 
 136 operating under command of 22 light air defence regiment ra was involved in the now famous bloody sunday in 
 derry the company manned three barriers one of which blocked the direct route of the march at this one particularly 
 they were heavily stoned but by using baton rounds and water cannons were able to halt the crowd their action 
 is recorded in the following extract from the report by lord widgery the pressure of the crowd from behind was 
 heavy and a densely packed mass formed at the barricade which was manned by men of the royal green jackets 
 the television film taken from behind the troops at the barrier show that the conduct of these soldiers was impeccable 
 despite the ugly situation which developed on arriving in belfast in july the ist battalion was required to enter the 
 no go area in andersonstown a centre of republicanism where all the main roads were barricaded and to which all 
 entry was controlled by the 1 r a where few if any paid rent electricity or gas bills or taxed 
 or insured their cars where there had been no proper road cleaning or refuse collection for two years and the 
 street lights had all been shot out and left where the gunmen roamed at will the police dared not enter 
 and intimidation and fear were so rife that no local dared so much as look at a serviceman lying wounded 
 in the street the task of the battalion was to flush out and eliminate the i r a gunmen there 
 and to restore a semblance of law and order the battalion spent the first month mostly patrolling searching and observing 
 needless to say it was not long before the i r a opened fire and it was whilst following up 
 one such incident that oc b company was severely injured entering a garage which blew up as he opened the 
 door however as more and more information was gained the battalion s successes built up and as intimidation reduced the 
 local population gradually became a bit more friendly in the meantime c company had become expert house searchers searching some 
 houses several times to ensure that nobody got the idea that once searched they were not liable to be searched 
 again unfortunately some occupants developed their own tactics to use against this one well known local lady used to run 
 up to her bedroom the moment our troops approached her house take off all her clothes and lie naked on 
 her bed inviting the riflemen to enter only to scream rape when they did finally only two days before the 
 ist battalion was due to depart a company caught the local i r a battalion commander then with only one 
 day to go the battalion had an excellent find in the form of five weapons and some 2000 rounds of 
 21 types of different ammunition finally to top it off they picked up the gang who owned them when the 
 reborn 3rd battalion arrived in august to complete the trio it took over responsibility in the upper falls and the 
 clonard districts of belfast a sector next to that of the ist battalion within fifteen hours of their arrival they 
 had no fewer than six shooting incidents in their area within the first twenty four hours the battalion had made 
 its first find of ammunition and one of its bases had been attacked with a blast bomb in fact shooting 
 incidents averaged about six a day during their first three months and snipers caused the majority of the battalion s 
 casualities to combat the snipers the battalion moved its patrols to selected target areas in vehicles which when the 
 137 patrols dismounted circled in the area so the combination of unpredictability and the constant threat the circling vehicles imposed 
 on withdrawal routes discouraged the snipers activities early in september the i r a attempted to blow up the commanding 
 officer s rover group by using a claymore mine rapid promotion was only avoided by the mine being placed the 
 wrong way round severely damaging the republican club building behind it later that month an almost completed tunnel was discovered 
 which ran nearly to the foundations of a b company platoon base according to local information a 200 lb bomb 
 was to have detonated in it the very next night the 3rd battalion had two sizable gun battles with the 
 i r a the first just before midnight on the 28th of august when a company had turned out in 
 force to gather information in beechmont road after one of their section commanders had been killed there suddenly at 2330 
 hours the whole area erupted with heavy firing in half a dozen different locations and a particularly fierce battle opposite 
 an r company op which looked likely to be overrun however an expedition consisting of an empty saracen apc escorted 
 by a rifle section and a troop of armoured cars succeeded in withdrawing the op without casualties and after two 
 hours the firing died out the second was on the 29th of september when at about 1300 hours sporadic sniper 
 fire started and the locals blocked lower falls road with two hijacked buses which they set on fire these were 
 driven clear by b company hq drivers covered by 7 platoon which had deployed to secure the area and which 
 then began a follow up operation into the lower falls whilst 5 platoon secured the falls road in the meantime 
 the locals succeeded in blocking the osman raglan street junction with a burning 60 ft truck two more platoons had 
 to be deployed and after some five hours relative calm was restored and b company withdrew during october the number 
 of shooting incidents fell off considerably but the capture of i r a officers increased dramatically by then the battalion 
 through painstaking intelligence work from the outset knew their opponents organization and order of battle so well that they could 
 even assess who the i r a would promote to command and were able to pick up three successive company 
 commanders in ten days by december the battalion was able to hand over a largely pacified area to its successors 
 in the meantime the rifle depot had been very busy coping with a considerable increase in recruits and with giving 
 the special training to fit them for service in northern ireland and also with the unenviable task of providing funeral 
 parties for members of the regiment killed or dying as a result of service there the 4th volunteer battalion also 
 increased in strength and held three camps one in england for recruits one in germany and one a company camp 
 for c company at hibernia camp on the gagetown training area in canada this was a great success much enjoyed 
 by the lucky members of c company finally we have to record with great regret that seven members of the 
 regiment were fatal casualties and forty five were wounded as a result of operations in northern ireland in 1972 
 138 as these notes are written in 1973 the ist and 3rd battalions are back in northern ireland again on 
 short tours but are finding life a good deal quieter than it was in 1972 the 2nd battalion are on 
 a short tour in belize lately british honduras the local motto there is that timing is unending and effort unthinkable

 145 my bisley adventure by cadet wol da ye hoon 2483 esquimalt ppcli cadet corps as a member of the 
 1973 bisley army cadet rifle team i left victoria for ottawa on june 28 1973 on a canadian armed forces 
 boeing 707 in ottawa i met the rest of the team which consisted of 16 fellow cadets from all across 
 canada each had earned a place on the team by competing throughout the previous year in the dominion of canada 
 rifle association matches in ottawa we were introduced to the chief of the defence staff general dextrase and here also 
 we were issued shooting equipment and practised daily on the connaught ranges before we left for bisley on july 1 
 i had the honour of attending a dominion of canada rifle association dinner to accept a silver medal an award 
 which i had earned by placing first in the indoor shooting for bisley cadets during the winter months arriving at 
 gatwick airport england on the afternoon of july 2 we travelled by coach from the airport to our accommodation the 
 honourable artillery company hut in the bisley camp the following few days were concerned with practising for the school boys 
 303 matches during our stay we familiarized ourselves with the camp and met the different competitors who were shooting in 
 the bisley matches one thing that fascinated me was watching the small well disciplined gurkas of the british army operate 
 the bisley camp matches they were well respected by all who encountered them our team entered in the english school 
 boy matches and the bisley all comers prize meet the standard of shooting was quite different from what we were 
 used to a canadian possible 50 50 was not high enough but a 50 10 v bulls might win you 
 a trophy the team entered in many interesting matches and came out with good results i was fortunate enough to 
 make the st george s 100 and was the only participating cadet english or canadian to do so this was 
 the most thrilling part of my shoot i also earned seven silver medals for placing high in other matches during 
 the shoot i made the personal acquaintance of many people such as brigadier general hut commander of the british army 
 of the rhine after the bisley prize meet the team went on tour across southern england from london to bristol 
 we visited many fascinating and interesting places such as the roman baths stonehenge thomas hardy s home in dorset winchester 
 cathedral and many more places no tourist could have covered all these places in such a limited time the tour 
 was pre arranged and covered quite a lot of historical sights that were indeed educational pages could be written on 
 all we saw in london we had dinner with the honourable artillery company which is the oldest regiment in the 
 world they supplied the accommodation for the bisley cadet team while in london we stayed in chelsea barracks with the 
 coldstream guards at that time on buckingham palace guard duties 
 146 the last week of our trip proved quite an experience first our boeing 707 from canada never arrived at 
 the airport to take us to lahr germany so we went by hercules what a ride that was we thought 
 that lahr would be quite an adventure when we got there but it was another story we found out that 
 the bicycles we had rented to go riding in the black forest had not arrived so our commandant arranged for 
 us to hike the 120 miles through the hills of the black forest which turned out to be a thrilling 
 experience we walked 25 miles a day ate in the local gasthofs and slept either in a pasture or barn 
 the hills we climbed were unbelievable but we all enjoyed the challenge we returned to lahr and from there went 
 on to switzerland visiting the town of basle and zurich then on to france visiting the maginot line strangely still 
 intact in places stopped off in the town of strasbourg and finally touched down brieily in belgium we returned to 
 ottawa by boeing 707 on august 14 now as i look back at my trip i realize how rewarding my 
 army cadet training proved to be the effort one puts into such training can be just as rewarding as mine 
 was i will always remember this trip and i wish at this time to acknowledge with thanks the many people 
 who have assisted me in this achievement my commanding officer capt r c watt my coach mr robert walker and 
 the cadet team commandant major j m letson i also wish to convey special thanks to the regiment for their 
 assistance from the hamilton gault memorial fund and the victoria branch ppcli association both of whom provided me with donations 
 to enable me to enjoy my trip better the cadet bisley team tour 1973 was the longest and the best 
 of any previous team tours thanks to the work and effort of major letson again to all concerned i say 
 many thanks hatley esso service complete automotive service 2148 sooke road victoria b c phone 478 2512 belmont general store

 147 ppcli regimental badges 1914 1974 captain l e grimshaw c d as my personal project to mark the diamond 
 jubilee of the regiment the following photographic collection of regimental badges has been prepared it is intended only to present 
 the principal patterns and variations of badges worn throughout the history of the regiment several of which may be unfamiliar 
 to many readers this short article can be construed neither as an exhaustive historical account nor a specialized catalogue of 
 badges information and records available are sparse to say the least and there are therefore undoubtedly errors omissions and other 
 inaccuracies in the following paragraphs nevertheless it is hoped that the presence of this collection in the jubilee patrician will 
 encourage readers to dust off both their memories and their memorabilia and that they will communicate either with the author 
 or the regimental adjutant regarding any errors or additional information the marguerite badge the first badge worn from 1914 to 
 1934 bore a marguerite flower as the centre of the design the officers badge was of silver with a gold 
 marguerite while the men s badge was of brass or bronze figure 1 shows two types of the men s 
 badge illustrating the principal varieties of design the one having a figure 1 two varieties of the marguerite badge 
 148 figure 2 marguerite officers cap and collar badge detailed petal and solid crown and the other a simple petal 
 and pierced crown the badge is found in a number of finishes from antique brass to dark brown to bright 
 brass and is of either stamped or cast metal the officers badge is shown at figure 2 with a collar 
 badge of the type worn until 1917 during world war i it was common for battalion pipe bands of the 
 canadian expeditionary force to wear a special version of the regimental badge the edmonton pipe band which joined the regiment 
 en masse in 1914 was no exception the ppcli pipe band badge fig 3 was the marguerite badge surrounded by 
 a wreath of maple leaves and thistles the badge is found in both silver and brass there were relatively few 
 of these badges made as the band numbered only 24 men each wearing two badges one on the sporran and 
 one on the glengarry cap only a few surviving copies are known the cypher badge in 1934 the cap badge 
 design was changed the marguerite centre being replaced by the cypher and coronet of lady patricia ramsay formerly hrh princess 
 patricia of connaught the officers badge was again of silver with the cypher and coronet of gold fig 4a it 
 existed in two sizes a two inch size cap badge and a larger version of identical pattern for wear on 
 the full dress wolseley helmet the men s badge until 1948 was of the same design but was solid rather 
 than pierced through the cypher fig 4b it is found in four metal and die varieties bright brass bright copper 
 darkened copper and white metal the dark finish was a 
 149 figure 3 pipe band badge figure 4 a left officers badge 1934 56 b centre men s badge 1934 
 48 c right men s badge 1948 56 
 150 figure 5 full dress badge non reflective active service requirement and the white metal one was a war time 
 expedient evidently economizing on copper and brass although one copy of the latter exists in the museum it is thought 
 that the badge was never on general issue and that the museum copy may have been an experimental one the 
 men s badge was altered in 1948 to conform to the officers design the badge fig 4c was pierced through 
 the cypher and was bimetal with colours reversed from the officers version the annulus and crown being of brass and 
 the cypher and coronet of white metal however the solid brass type returned to wear as an interim badge during 
 the expansion in 1950 52 for korea and was worn by men of the 2nd and 3rd battalions until enough 
 of the 1948 pattern badges were made available there was also an embroidered gold and silver variation of the cypher 
 badge fig 5 one copy in the museum is known and is reputed to have been worn with the forage 
 cap with full dress in the 19305 however regimental records contain no mention of it the current badge following the 
 ascension of hm the queen the badge pattern was altered in 1956 to incorporate st edward s crown otherwise the 
 basic design of officers and men s badges remained unchanged the officers and men s badges are illustrated at fig 
 6a and b respectively 
 151 several variations are found in the officers badges the regulation officers badge fig 7a is of sterling silver and 
 has a smaller crown than that of the men s badge however a silver plated large crown variety fig 7b 
 is known for the past several years the regimental kit shop has experienced difficulty procurring officers badges and in 1973 
 a number of interim badges were obtained these are chrome plated and were cast from the die from which the 
 men s badge was made and are therefore somewhat larger than the regulation officers badge another unofficial chromed variety exists 
 in the form of the men s badge plated in reverse colours to make an officers silver badge these badges 
 originated in the early 1960 s and are known colloquially within the regiment as jim honey specials this type was 
 procurred by impecunious subalterns for reasons of economy the official reason was to have an inexpensive badge for wear in 
 the field thereby avoiding possible loss or damage of a silver badge although it is suspected that the dimensions of 
 some of their mess bills precluded the purchase of the more expensive silver badges figure 6 1956 to date a 
 left officers badge b right men s badge the collar badges have undergone relatively few changes originally officers wore a 
 marguerite collar badge fig 2 while men wore the standard canada general service maple leaf collar badge the light infantry 
 bugle horn collar badge fig 8a was adopted for wear by officers in 1917 and by other ranks in 
 152 figure 7 detail of crowns of a left regulation pattern and b right large crown type officers badges figure 
 8 collar badges a top left regular pattern b top right solid crown variety c bottom canadian forces pattern 
 153 figure 9 selection of metal shoulder titles 1920 and with the exception of a solid coronet officers variety fig 
 8b both types continued unchanged until 1969 at that time a smaller version fig 8c was authorized for wear with 
 the canadian forces green uniform the men s badge is brass and the officers is silver plated the plating on 
 the latter is thin and subject to erasure from polishing and consequently many officers have had their collar badges chrome 
 plated there is virtually no mention in regimental records of metal shoulder titles although several varieties can be found fig 
 9 the large curved title is of world war i vintage and appears to have been worn only by officers 
 photographic evidence indicates that other ranks wore the red and white cloth title on the shoulder of the sleeve with 
 a brass canada title on the epaulette no information is available regarding the reasons and dates of introduction of various 
 patterns of the straight title the red and white cloth title was introduced by the first commanding officer lt col 
 farquhar presumably this was an expedient because the rapid formation and mobilization of the regiment precluded the production of metal 
 titles on short notice in any case lt col farquar appears to have 
 154 figure 10 ppcli association beret badge invented the cloth shoulder title it was adopted by british guards regiments in 
 flanders and soon spread throughout the armies of the commonwealth moreover it appears that it was in recognition of the 
 historical nature of the ppcli flash that the regiment was the only canadian army unit which retained its initials only 
 on its flash in the early 1950 s when all the others were required to spell out their name or 
 at least most of it in full no collection of regimental badges would be complete without the embroidered beret badge 
 of the ppcli association fig 10 in addition in recognition of another association the regimental badge is worn on the 
 sporran of the city of edmonton police pipe band the badge was presented to the band to commemorate the association 
 of the original edmonton pipe band with the regiment the present police pipe band is therefore considered to be the 
 spiritual if not lineal descendent of that earlier group of gallant men this then is my jubilee collection of regimental 
 badges most have little intrinsic value but they all represent the thousands of men who have worn them proudly and 
 they symbolize their spirit and traditions which are the life of the regiment and which distinguish it from all others

 memorial service was held in taunton somerset for mrs gault and this was attended by the colonel of the regiment 
 commanding officers and several other serving officers as well as your vice patron colonel j h carvosso your president and 
 members of the united kingdom branch of the association we also lost through death during the year several active members 
 of the association two of whom were colonel r f bruce a former commanding officer of ist battalion and piper 
 j m robertson in november last a further report was received from the special committee set up to make a 
 last effort to obtain appropriate action by mr w e bastedo for the return of memorabilia loaned by w w 
 i veterans and for an accounting for monies contributed for his project early memories and tales of the p p 
 c l i the committee s conclusion supported by the opinion of legal counsel was that further action at this 
 time would be useless since this confirms the findings of earlier studies and negotiations your executive recommends that the association 
 take no further action while present conditions exist later in this meeting i shall ask you to officially express appreciation 
 to colonel j c allan and the members of his committee and to mr brian r d smith who advised 
 on the legal aspect of the problem the trustees of the hamilton gault memorial fund have again given financial support 
 to the sponsored cadet corps and the secretary will report on the results of the competitions in the years 1972 
 and 1973 you will also be given a report on the current financial postion of the patrician and the regimental 
 newsletter plans for an appropriate recognition in 1974 by several units of the regiment of the 60th anniverasary of its 
 founding and the 35th anniversary of its proceeding overseas in w w ii are well under way and several branches 
 of the association are also developing proposals for their participation the change in command of the 2nd battalion which was 
 underway at the time of our last meeting was duly consummated and the unit has since served a six 6 
 month tour in cyprus your president had the privilege of spending a very pleasant week with the unit in the 
 month of march 1973 just prior to their return to canada 
 160 in the month of july 1973 there were changes of command of both the ist and 3rd battalions and 
 your president was privileged to be present at both ceremonies in calgary and victoria respectively he also had the honour 
 to stand in for the colonel of the regiment for certain formalities as general ware was unable to attend due 
 to a temporary indisposition while i do not have the necessary knowledge to give you any extensive report on the 
 services being rendered to the regimental family by former members i am sure you will be interested to know that 
 mr kerry j dunphy mm who is now a service officer at the headquarters of the royal canadian legion in 
 ottawa has been most helpful in obtaining pensions and or improved pensions for several retired members and their families kerry 
 served in the ranks with 2nd battalion in korea and was later commissioned he is now the energetic secretary treasurer 
 of the ottawa branch of the association once again i must commend to you the outstanding contribution being made by 
 our secretary treasurer captain v d cole in the interest of the association and particularly during a year when his 
 duties as regimental adjutant have been unusually arduous item 10 the secretary treasurer s report 1 annual summary the annual 
 summary with its required 10 00 fee was submitted to the department of consumer and corporate affairs on the 11th 
 of april 1973 2 frezenburg memorial the annual report from the commonwealth war graves commission received on the 3rd of 
 novemeber 1972 reads the memorial is in good structural and horticultural condition and satisfactory in general appearance some minor painting 
 and treatment of 2 small bronze panels will be carried out during the 1972 73 maintenance cycle 3 the patrician 
 the patrician began when the selling price was increased from 50 cents and 1 50 to 2 00 and 4 
 00 respectively with a debit of 1 520 56 it has recovered to a debit of 193 06 in 7 
 i a months of this year it s a healthy picture at the moment however to have proceeded as we 
 have in the past it would again have gone to the debit side of the ledger upon publication this year 
 as a consequence we have cut corners and utilized some facilities of a non public nature which are available at 
 base edmonton the quality of materials used in the book are slightly inferior to what we are used to the 
 size of the type has been decreased by a minimal amount there are more advertisements than usual and you will 
 likely be able to find more mistakes in spelling grammar layout etc on the credit side the content is still 
 the record of the year s happenings the number of pages has increased by 41 over the previous year and 
 the cover and bindings are of the same quality as used since 1969 the process which we have followed will 
 allow us to move to next year s publication with a substantial profit rather than the continual debit we have 
 experienced in the past

 167 victoria branch the branch received a rude shock when the third battalion sergeants mess was razed by fire early 
 in 1973 for many years it was the monthly meeting place and we have pleasant memories of the old mess 
 we are pleased to note that the warrant officers and sergeants now have a new mess smaller than the previous 
 one but quite comfortable and pleasantly decorated in order that we be accommodated our meetings were held on the last 
 thursday of each month for a time this proved unsatisfactory for our members and we have since returned to fridays 
 during the fall we met in the junior ranks sergeants and officers messes in rotation this proved most satisfactory and 
 enjoyable the final function of the year was a mixed buffet in the officers mess with approximately 80 members and 
 their ladies we have been supported and encouraged by the past and present commanding officers lieutenant colonels phil roy and 
 dick cowling the deputy commanding officer major murray stewart is also a source of strength and helpful ideas this help 
 and encouragement extends throughout the battalion and the victoria branch can count itself fortunate that it has the battalion in 
 its locale the branch lost a number of members through the year members whose deaths were tragic as they went

 colonel in chief s birthday was suitably celebrated with a candlelight dinner and dancing in the officers mess of the 
 canadian airborne regiment at griesbach barracks the usual comaraderie was in evidence and the normal regimental songs were duly rendered

 in september we had the privilege of being co hosts with the loyal edmonton regiment 4 ppcli and the forty 
 niners friday evening the 14th commenced with a registration followed by a retreat ceremony and terminated with an excellent barbeque 
 at camp harris saturday morning was when the annual meeting took place and an historic element was present in the 
 fact that the regimental association of both regiments convened their meetings simultaneously the first time this had ever taken place 
 together during the afternoon both associations were invited to parade with the loyal edmonton regiment 4 ppcli as they exercised 
 their right to the freedom of the city of edmonton saturday culminated with a gala ball at which approximately 300 
 people were present on sunday morning wreaths were laid at the cenotaph and a memorial service was held in christ

 our colonel in chief on the 12th of january has written 30 to an era of unmatched history her service

 o clarke treasurer j reid executive j demytriw c o huggard j slimkowich w r stevens w stride auditor v 
 f gianelli no momentous decisions were made but necessary nuts and bolts were attended to so that the branch could 
 get through another year it was decided not to raise the dues at this time but consideration would be given 
 to this matter at a later date during the evening jim reid our treasurer was presented with his citation conferring 
 upon him honorary life membership in the association it is believed that this is the first time in the history 
 of the branch that such an honour has been given to someone not of world war i vintage on march 
 17th the members gathered together to celebrate the birthday of the colonel in chief there were equal numbers of ist 
 and 2nd war vets and a couple who had seen action in korea it was a quiet but comradely evening 
 the kind that leaves a glow and warmth for some time after saying av revoir to friends the film showing 
 the homecoming of the regiment in march 1919 shown may sth saw the branch gathered once again at fort york 
 armoury for the fifty fourth annual dinner to commemorate the battles of frezenberg hitler line and kapyong we were honoured 
 by the presence of major general a e potts during the evening vie gianelli one of the mainstays of the 
 branch was presented with a beautiful engraved picture of lady patricia set in a plaque of clear acrylic things were 
 fairly quiet for the toronto branch during the summer with a resulting dearth of news perhaps if it could be 
 arranged for association members to go along on some of those swans that seem to take the regular fellows to 
 the far corners of the world we might be able to come up with some interesting copy apart from a 
 couple of executive meetings no activities took place until november 10th when we held our remembrance day celebration in the 
 48th highlanders sergeants mess at moss park armoury although the turn out was small it was good to see the 
 old sweats who did show up 
 178 and so we look foward to 1974 it is hoped that during the 60th anniversary a goodly number of 
 members will attend the functions planned we also expect to have a tri city get together and plan to send 
 representatives to some of the regimental celebrations all members of the toronto branch extend their greetings and good wishes for 
 the 60th anniversary secure in the knowledge that patricias everywhere will once again come through with that little bit extra 
 that makes them members of the regiment last post the passing of the following patricias in the toronto area was

 of age or the inability to travel we were most happy to welcome the new residents of hatch court commander 
 and mrs b h c nation we are hoping to celebrate the jubilee year in a fitting manner the old 
 guard in england will not be able to celebrate with others in canada much as they may wish to do

 185 kapyong a speech by col jr stone dso mc to the officers of 3 ppcli on 18 dec 73 
 when i was a small boy at school god knows that was a long time ago i memorized a poem 
 entitled the battle of blenheim the story was of a small boy finding something large and smooth and round and 
 bringing it to his grandfather and asking what he had found his grandfather told him that it was some poor 
 fellow s skull who fell in that great victory the poem finishes thus what they killed each other for i 
 cannot well make out but men say quoth he it was a famous victory as i look back and follow 
 events from kapyong up to date i feel much the same about korea why did we kill one another when 
 our then deadly enemies the chinese communists are now our great and good friends mind you the so called police 
 action in korea did not result in a famous victory however a certain number of us for various reasons joined 
 battle with north koreans and chinamen and the battle of kapyong on which i speak tonight was one of the 
 engagements of that long drawn out struggle which has not finished yet and which resulted in all too many of 
 those large smooth round things being buried in the ground the battle of kapyong was fought on april 24 25 
 1951 this is a long time ago and my memory is deficient of many of the happenings of those two 
 days generally i can discuss the plan of defence the execution of the plan and the successful move out of 
 the position on april 26 in my opinion there was something of much greater importance at kapyong than the tactics 
 of defence kapyong demonstrated that morale spirit of the troops or call it what you will is probably the most 
 important factor in battle and all the logistical support the finest plan and the many other factors that are considered 
 as requirements to fight a battle are subsidiary to it second battalion princess patricia s canadian light infantry was recruited 
 mainly from the streets as was the rest of the 25th brigade which was to represent canada in korea many 
 were the stories told of the recruiting snafus you can read about them in strange battleground written by herb wood 
 himself a patricia general slim maclin then the adjutant general described it succinctly to me after i returned from korea 
 he said that trying to rush recruiting was analogous to trying to rush the process of procreation he said if 
 you and your wife decide to have a baby you take the necessary sexual action and await the normal gestation 
 period if you try to hurry the process you get an abortion that is what the recruiting operation for korea 
 was many recruits were re treads from world war 2 i was one myself among them were many dead beats 
 escapists from domestic and other troubles cripples neurotics and other useless types all of whom broke down under the rigorous 
 training program and were got rid of prior to our going into action here i might also say that those 
 who joined to fight for a cause were most 
 186 difficult to find bill boss our accompanying war correspondent questioned almost every man in the battalion trying to find 
 the idealist the man who joined solely to fight a holy war against communism like diogenes searching with his lantern 
 trying to find an honest man bill was unsuccessful the strength of the battalion was in its adventurers those who 
 joined the army because there was a war to fight and they wanted to be there personally i believe that 
 all volunteer armies in wartime are composed mostly of adventurers except for civil wars the crusades were probably the last 
 wars where individuals fought for cause and the loot of some of the participants of those wars make their motives 
 for fighting suspect in talking of the strengths of the second battalion i would be remiss if i did not 
 mention the part played by the officers warrant officers and non commissioned officers who were transferred to us from first 
 battalion they gave the battalion a professional backbone and of course conducted a large part of the training i am 
 sure that much of our success as a unit stemmed from the efforts of these excellent soldiers by the time 
 we had weeded out the scruff we had a first class high spirited group of soldiers ardant dv picq a 
 military writer of note wrote the man is the first weapon of battle wavell said in one of his wonderful 
 lectures and i paraphrase that tactics and strategy are to the battle what the skeleton is to the body bare 
 bones they are fleshed out with the blood and guts of the men that fight that is why in talking 
 of any battle i stress first the men who fought it from recruiting in august 1950 to our first crack 
 at the enemy in february 1951 we had lived together and trained together when we left for korea in november 
 1950 we became almost an autonomous body discipline training purchasing our requirements and almost everything else became battalion responsibilities we 
 had no rear headquarters closer than seattle and the canadian military mission in japan really had no responsibility for us 
 we were on our own when we landed in korea we were fairly well trained as individuals but we had 
 no group or collective training i introduced a regime of tough training as soon as we were established in a 
 suitable area here i might give the facts of a story which has been speculated on for a number of 
 years when we left canada the war in korea appeared to be over the north korean forces had been hurled 
 back and mac arthur was crying on to the yalu my battalion was untrained but to get in before the 
 ceasefire it was decided to send 2 ppcli to show the flag among those of the un i was sent 
 to korea to train when we docked at yokohama the head of our military mission in japan presented me with 
 a hypothetical case of my being ordered into action on my arrival in korea i said that i couldn t 
 and wouldn t go into action without eight weeks training he speculated on the result of such an attitude on 
 my part but said it was my prerogative and wished me luck on arrival in pusan the g 3 rear 
 of the bth army informed me that i was to be married up with my stores and vehicles and was 
 to proceed within 3 days 
 187 to suwon and join the british 29th brigade i informed the gentleman of my state of training and the 
 impossibility of the battalion going into action immediately the g 3 said that he had his orders and he had 
 given me mine and to get going i asked where the commander of the bth army was located and he 
 told me seoul i asked for an aeroplane which he made available and i flew to seoul to see general 
 walker i put my position to him and his senior staff and although he was most pleasant he said that 
 my troops were trained as well as the us reinforcements and the situation was desperate fortunately i had been given 
 a piece of paper prior to leaving canada which gave me the authority for decision on committing my battalion i 
 waved the paper general walker wanted no political repercussions and agreed with my demand for 8 weeks training time i 
 told him that i would assist in the defence of the naktong river line if the evacuation of the un 
 forces from korea became necessary as the british 29th brigade was seriously mauled in the ensuing week i can easily 
 imagine what would have happened to us several years later peter worthington writing in the toronto telegram said stone s 
 stubbornness saved a battalion from annihilation exaggerated but possible general walker was killed 3 days after my interview with him 
 we trained for six weeks and i then announced our readiness for action second battalion was a singing battalion more 
 songs were composed by members of 2 ppcli than the rest of the eighth army put together their favourite marching 
 song had a refrain we re untrained bums we re from the slums they were just a wonderful group of 
 men i believed in them they believed in me and what is more important they believed in one another non 
 professional by your standards half trained they were typically the young men that wavell described as the flesh and blood 
 of battle the battalion came out of the line to celebrate march 17 at a place called chipyongni i was 
 not feeling too well and a day or two later was sent to hospital in japan with a condition diagnosed 
 as hepatitus in japan it was discovered that i had smallpox and i was hospitalized and quarantined until the middle 
 of april i had a few days convalescent leave and returned to the battalion on april 22 a massive chinese 
 offensive was battering hell out of a rok corps to the north of us and in that same offensive further 
 west the glosters of the british 29th brigade were surrounded cut up and had to surrender a new defensive line 
 had been reconnoitered on the han river but the chinese had to be stopped to allow for a proper withdrawal 
 third battalion royal australian regiment and 2 ppcli with the middlesex regiment in reserve were given the task of holding 
 the front on the kapyong river until the total withdrawal to the han river could be effected if you have 
 seen the map of the kapyong battleground you will have noted that the australians had the lower feature on the 
 right hill 504 our feature hill 677 was much larger and i must confess much more difficult to attack here 
 i will interpose if you ever have to take up a defensive position on a mountain of that size with 
 a battalion of infantry make sure first that you listen carefully to orders and know your objectives and second that 
 you 
 188 search your memory for everything you have been taught about the selection of vital ground from which to conduct 
 a defence on april 23 i took forward a large reconnaissance party of company commanders gunner rep mortar rep mmg 
 and battalion mortar platoon commanders we were able to look at the feature from the enemy side which gave us 
 a good idea of probable attack approaches therefore i was able to select the vital ground which had to be 
 defended to deny the approaches to the enemy 677 is about a mile and a half across gullied wooded and 
 impossible to defend in the classic manner of deploying companies to support each other each company had to develop its 
 own individual defended locality the platoons being mutually supporting the gaps between the companies would bave to be covered to 
 some extent by defensive fire tasks of the mmg selections the battalion 81 mm mortars the us mortar company and 
 the new zealand 25 pdr regiment i issued orders in the late afternoon of april 23 and we commenced moving 
 into position that afternoon the defensive plan followed the lines of my appreciation in that companies were in individual defended 
 localities deployed so that the platoons were mutually supporting our 6 vickers mmgs were deployed by sections giving depth to 
 the defence and covering the gaps between companies the battalion mortars supported with defensive fire tasks a company of us 
 120 mm mortars were supporting the total brigade effort but when the battle got hot on the australian front the 
 foo from the us mortars on my front walked out and never a pop did we get from his company 
 the new zealand artillery regiment had far too big a front to cover but they gave their all the australians 
 with a company of heavy us tanks moved into position on hill 504 at about the same time we moved 
 up we had a hard time getting our mortars on half tracks into the re entrant that i had selected 
 for them and the battalion hq however my untrained bums were never daunted and using explosive to blow a few 
 rock corners off the track side we moved in and were deployed in the early hours of the morning of 
 april 24 the australians were heavily attacked during the night of 23 24 april the attack was so intense that 
 i feared for my right flank i decided to change my deployment and ordered b company commanded by major vince 
 lilley to move from their position which was partly dug in and dig in several hundred yards to the right 
 where they could overlook the valley of the kapyong how fortunate this move was the australians were over run the 
 battalion hqs set on fire and the commanding officer ordered his companies to get out as best they could to 
 the middlesex regiment s position to their rear 2 ppcli was now stuck out on its own with no support 
 on either flank there was very little activity on our front during the day of april 24 early in the 
 evening we were lightly mortared and mmg fire using tracer was directed against b company b company then was attacked 
 with ground troops chinese bugles and tracer fire directed the chinamen onto their objectives and they succeeded in over running 
 one platoon however the main company position held the attack was beaten off and the situation restored 
 189 a little later vince lilley called me on the blower to tell me that a strong force of enemy 
 had entered the re entrant behind his position and were moving on my headquarters the mortar platoon in those days 
 was mounted for travelling on twelve half tracks each half track was equipped with one 50 and one 30 browning 
 machine gun these were loaded 1 tracer to 4 ball we held fire until the chinamen broke through the trees 
 about 200 yards away and then 24 machine guns cut loose together what with the rattle of the guns and 
 the mortars firing at their shortest range the enemy never had a chance some of them are probably running yet 
 the attack on the battalion continued throughout the night we fired every weapon that we had and the new zealand 
 gunners supported d company received special attention the company commander wally mills reported to me over the telephone the line 
 was miraculously intact that his position was over run and that the enemy had infiltrated everywhere after some conversation in 
 which he assured me that the company was well dug in he asked for an artillery concentration right on top 
 of his position i obliged the attacks on this position continued but supporting fire from our mortars and the artillery 
 each time drove off the enemy by morning all attacks subsided and except for the fact that we were heavily 
 shelled april 25 was relatively quiet our supply route was cut and i had no way of knowing how long 
 we might have to hold the position or how aggressive the enemy might become so in the early hours of 
 april 25 i requested an airdrop of ammunition food and water six hours later 4 ci 19s dropped by parachute 
 everything requested including 81 mm mortar ammunition when it comes to supply you cannot beat the us forces that afternoon 
 patrols from b company reported that the road to the rear was open and i had additional supplies come up 
 by road on april 26 us tanks took over our defensive task while we withdrew to another holding line prior 
 to moving to a more permanent line on the han river our casualties were very light 10 killed and 23 
 wounded our seriously wounded were evacuated by helicopter right in the midst of the battle again a wonderful service given 
 by us forces which saved lives and raised morale kapyong was not a great battle as battles go it was 
 a good battle well planned and well fought personally i believe that kapyong was the limit of the planned offensive 
 of the chinese at that time had that limit been five miles further south we should have been annihilated as 
 were the glosters the numbers that the chinese were prepared to sacrifice against a position meant that eventually any unsupported 
 battalion in defence must be over run the chinese soldier is tough and brave all that he lacked at the 
 time of kapyong were communications and supply perhaps death was preferable to the life he was compelled to lead for 
 he certainly was not afraid to die therefore i say that we were lucky that he did not persist with 
 his attacks in my opinion our success in holding our position and inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy was due 
 in the most part to these factors 
 190 a we had trained and fought together for some eight months we believed in one another and the morale 
 of the battalion was high no one panicked even when we knew that we were surrounded and that there was 
 some infdtration of the position by the enemy b we had ample time for a proper reconnaissance and all subordinate 
 commanders had a look at the ground in daylight c although i was never a highly skilled soldier i have 
 always had a good eye for ground therefore the ground that was vital to the defence of the area came 
 quickly to my view d the move of b company to the right after the australians were beaten back no 
 doubt saved our right flank and gave warning of the move of the enemy on the bn hq area e 
 the evacuation of the wounded by helicopter was a big booster to morale and took a great load off my 
 mind f the airdrop of supplies was a wonderful bit of organization in japan as we had two supply sources 
 us and british our ammunition had to be procured from both sources we would have been in sorry straits had 
 we not been supplied by air the united states presidential citation is awarded to units which in the opinion of 
 the senior commander in the field and in the name of the president of the united states deserve public recognition 
 of earned honour and distinction 2ppcli was so honoured even though the award was not popular in some higher canadian 
 military circles i will only say this about the award i repeat that kapyong was not a great battle however 
 we were surrounded by the enemy we could have run panicked in some way or surrendered we stayed fought and 
 withdrew on orders in a soldierly fashion this in itself was unique in korea where bug outs were the normal 
 manner of withdrawing in the circumstances i say that the award was well earned and the battalion deserved public recognition 
 of its actions of april 24 25 1951 if my talk this evening is to be worthwhile some guidance for 
 your future action should stem from it may i leave a thought or two with you before i sit down 
 the success at kapyong was due mainly to high morale and to good company platoon and section commanders in their 
 isolated defence areas they kept their heads down the morale of their troops up and their weapons firing whatever support 
 i could give i gave but the battle was theirs wavell said while lecturing to cambridge university the pious greek 
 when he set up altars to all the great gods by name added one more altar to the unknown god 
 so whenever we speak of the great captains and set up our military altars to hannibal napoleon marlborough and their 
 like let us add one more altar to the unknown leader that is the good company platoon or section leader 
 who carries forward his men or holds his post and often falls unknown it is these who in the end 
 do most to win wars that is something that we should never overlook in our military training too much officer 
 training is aimed at high levels of command and not enough at the company and platoon level with a modicum 
 of experience at the lower 
 191 levels anyone can take over at the higher many poor commanders have stayed in command at brigade and divisional 
 level in consequence of having a good staff at the platoon or company level the poor commander is discovered the 
 first day so i say that a division can survive with poor command for awhile but i ll be damned 
 if a platoon or a company can therefore play only superficially at moving divisions on 1 over 250 000 maps 
 with fingers spread making right and left hooks concentrate on section platoon and company tactics learn from experience just what 
 human beings can endure and still fight learn to do your jobs properly at your own levels of command it 
 is surprising how easy it is to command a battalion when you have had success in commanding a company and 
 remember always that the man is the first weapon of battle train him toughen him treat him fairly and demonstrate 
 to him always your fitness to be his commander when the days come that you need him as it did
