 render them ineligible for appointment to the senate on 24 april 1928 the supreme court of canada found unanimously in
 favour of the crown in the decision chief justice anglin stated that women along with children criminals and the insane
 were not persons under the strict interpretation of the bna act and were therefore ineligible to sit in the canadian
 senate 2 the decision was a tremendous disappointment to many interested groups and individuals mary ellen smith an mla from
 british columbia wrote a letter to emily murphy after the decision and in it she said where it was reworded
 to read more narrowly the revised petition asked specifically does the word ‘ person in section 24 of the bna
 act include female persons the five women petitioners agreed that this version be presented before the supreme court of canada
 on 28 march 1928 newton wesley rowell k c acting as the women s counsel and backed by the attorney
 general of alberta appeared before the supreme court of canada in edwards vs the attorney general of canada among other
 points of law rowell argued that under the british interpretations act 1850 which was in effect prior to the bna
 act all words denoting the masculine gender automatically included the feminine gender unless otherwise specifically stated 7 rowell also argued
 that the dominion elections act of 1920 had quoted the interpretation act when it declared that the word persons in
 section 41 of the british north america act must be interpreted to include females as a result of the 1920
 elections act women had become eligible for election to the house of commons in opposition to the petition the federal
 crown and the quebec counsel argued that at the time of confederation and the implementation of the bna act no
 one had intended or envisaged that women would hold public office 8 therefore the correct reading of section 24 of

 canada the appellants took their case to the highest court of appeal in the british empire which was the judicial
 committee of the privy council in england it was at this point that the canadian campaign was assisted by developments
 within the british parliament itself in british parliamentary circles margaret bonfield was gaining prominence she had previously headed the bonfield

 before the judicial committee of the privy council their lordships sankey darling merrivale tomlin and sanderson reserved judgment for three
 months when the privy council reconvened on 18 october 1929 they rendered a lengthy ruling in favour of the appellants
 stating that the word persons in section 24 does include women and that women are eligible to be summoned to
 and become members of the senate of canada the crux of the matter revolved around the struggle for recognition and
 equality of the female person under the law according to the press and the famous five as the five women
 were now dubbed the persons case was an important issue for many canadians because it challenged entrenched legal definitions and
 ultimately achieved recognition of women s identity as persons from a pragmatic perspective not many women would aspire to a
 senatorial position but the lasting significance of the case for those who cared about identity did not lie in senatorial
 appointments what had originally been a narrow legal issue had now been expanded upon by many to reflect the need
 for equality identity and dignity the initial opposition towards women was moulded into a campaign which reflected the female humiliation
 of being classified as a non person and that this discrimination had been exercised by the and that the exclusion
 of women from all public offices is a relic of days more barbarous than ours further in their historic decision

 canada the canadian government and to varying degrees every provincial government excluding alberta the supreme court ruling had dismissed women
 s identity and this had been deeply offensive the british privy council was keenly aware of the issues in canada
 and also of the presence of the hon margaret bonfield within their own midst the ruling of the judicial committee
 of the privy council reflected this awareness the decision was reported extensively in the canadian press in calgary both the
 albertaji and the calgary herald covered the proceedings in detail this was also the case for the edmonton journal the
 lethbridge herald the red deer advocate the regina morning leader the montreal gazette the toronto globe the vancouver sun and
 the western producer in addition there was coverage by popular canadian periodicals such as farm and ranch review and the
 chatelaine the print media covered two basic themes first the narrowly defined historical legal issues and the ramifications of women
 s access to the senate second for public consumption the press adopted a practical approach to this civil rights cause
 as the press and many of the public perceived the issue when it acknowledged women as persons and overturned the
 canadian supreme court decision these underlying sentiments were conveyed and emphasized by the press on 18 october 1929 the calgary

 able to digest mentally the fine points of the law involved in the argument that went on as to whether
 a woman is a person in relation to the senate of canada but it sic will freely concede that common
 sense is altogether on the side of the decision of the privy council that a women is a person the
 strange thing about it all is that it was necessary for the women of canada to go to the courts
 to establish that point nellie mcclung in an article written for the farm and ranch review expounded on the same
 point 27 addressing the recent privy council decision and perhaps the studied ignorance of numerous canadian females she wrote that
 many canadian women received a shock when reading their newspaper on 18 october 1929 as they read on the first
 page in bold black type that the lords of the privy council had declared them to be persons that was
 not the shock the shock came in the implication that they had not always been persons byrne hope sanders editor
 of the chatelaine magazine in 1929 also commented on the issues of female equality and freedom underlying the persons case
 sanders wrote that the magazine was intensely interested in the privy council ruling since it marked the removal of the

 by and he became more and more assured in his position his attitude changed from that of humble dependent to
 dominant partner he began to look upon the establishment as his rather than ours this first became manifest in his
 decision to extend his activities as watch dog from the prevention of improper or doubtful intrusion on our actual premises
 to the street or road as it then was that passed alongside not in front of the property on which
 there was considerable traffic he took upon himself to challenge the passage of all horse drawn vehicles especially those travelling
 at speed he would rush out with every appearance of ferocity barking vociferously and frightening the horses by jumping at
 their heads whether the apparent attempt to stop teams was a matter of principle as connected with his protective duties
 or merely a form of amusement i do not know from time to time we had a series of intensive
 arguments on the subject on my part i may say that my views were reinforced by a handy and efficient
 rawhide or short whip his protests could be heard across the river valley had there been a blue cross association
 in edmonton at that time i would probably have had to face a charge of cruelty to animals but the
 the difficulties of the situation were accentuated by the fact that as newspaper editor i was exposed to the material
 as well as verbal resentment of indignant subscribers who objected to their horses being attacked on the public street by
 a dog that whoever was his owner obviously used my premises as his base of operations i was also a
 member of the north west legislature for the edmonton district so that i was doubly vulnerable to adverse individual opinions
 based on his misconduct and yet i was helpless i could not send him home for i did not know
 who his owner was i could not give him away for no one would take him i did not dare
 to kill him for he was not mine i was tied up in a hard knot and no remedy in

 1932 alberta history isummer 1999 in those days a few dozen houses were time cultivation was limited and only the
 spread over the same area of both sides cultivated fields were fenced this left of the river practically every house
 had the greater part of the land open to a dog although houses were frequently public pasturage and cattle grazed

 nights he began to bark their detriment as to his pleasure within fifteen minutes it seemed that all the dogs
 in edmonton and on both sides as the only means of preventing these of the valley would be trying to
 bark pernicious practices we tied him up their heads off to start the concert before starting out on our drive
 that seemed quite easy to stop it was was all right for once although his entirely another matter after a
 time it howls of protest continued at least as would die down a little but some of the long as
 we were within hearing on the many dogs having been thoroughly occasion of our next drive he aroused would keep
 their respective disappeared as soon as preparations for owners awake until daylight while i hitching the horse began of course
 he had no doubt as to the responsibility of joined us when we were well on our way our dog
 for these sleep killing concerts with results to grazing cattle as usual it was not a matter easy of proof
 at any the situation had become impossible rate so far as that form of diversion was with no solution in
 sight but acute evils concerned he got clear away with it sometimes bring their own remedy that was the case
 in this instance included in our establishment of those days was a horse and buckboard this on the occasion of
 the last drive in means of transport enabled the family which he had part we had taken the in sections
 from time to time to view precaution of tying him up as we the beauties of the countryside at that

 above this is a view of jasper avenue in edmonton in 1890 about the time that oliver was having his
 adventures with our dog alberta history i summer 1999 our intention to go driving when the had been having fun
 with mr price s process of hitching the horse began he cows he price was mad clear through protested with
 all the vehemence that a and was obviously prepared for all voice equipment always in excellent contingencies repair rendered possible
 we rather felt as we drove off that at last we had bested it may strike the reader that as
 i had him whether his persistent howling permitted our dog to make his home distracted the neighbors so that rather
 with us it was up to me to protect him than listen longer they had turned him from the wrath
 of mr price i did not see loose or whether he managed to break it in that way he had
 abused our away by his own efforts we never knew at any rate as we were calmly driving hospitality and
 had proven absolutely along the fort saskatchewan trail near incorrigible in his many indiscretions the belmont schoolhouse just beyond whether
 playful or vicious countering the present limits of the city our dog mr price s attack i specifically denied hove
 in sight and soon caught up to us ownership and repudiated responsibility with every evidence of being highly leaving his
 fate absolutely at the pleased with himself and his discretion of mr price it was an achievement i need scarcely
 say that our outstanding instance of honesty being frame of mind was the direct opposite the best or indeed the
 only policy beyond the school the trail passed through the homestead of mr james when the forward movement of the
 price whose herd of milking cows were buckboard was checked for the grazing on his land and near the trail
 discussion with mr price our dog ceased his chase of the cattle and came this was too good a chance
 for our dog back to the vicinity of the buckboard to miss orders and threats to the evidently fearing that
 if he got too far contrary notwithstanding he gave his usual attention to the cows and beyond a away he
 might miss something he was doubt had a most enjoyable time but it right this was mr price s opportunity
 and the career of our dog closed then was very bad for the cows mr price was an englishman and
 therefore had a and there with a bang or more very full appreciation of the rights of properly with two
 bangs for in his then property both as to livestock and real frame of mind mr price did not propose
 estate his profession or calling in the to take any chances on our playful but old country had been that
 of indiscreet and headstrong companion brickmaker those who have been staging a come back privileged to have contacts with gentlemen
 of that calling on their native i am unable to say what mr price s heath will have a faint
 appreciation of estimate may have been on myself as the late mr price s verbal approach to one who would
 neither protect nor be the subject of responsibility of owners responsible for his own dog no doubt of vicious dogs
 which without cause or he thought the dog was really mine provocation attacked the cattle and but he may have
 charitably concluded especially milking cows of the owner of that no better could be expected from a the land on
 which they grazed he had a complete case man in politics as i then was to a very limited degree
 whatever mr price the law and the facts were both on his thought of me i shall always recall him
 side he also carried a very efficient if not in the guise of a protecting and looking double barrelled shotgun
 of avenging angel at least as one who necessity the argument was quite one cleared up for me an otherwise
 sided i am under the impression that impossible situation i have therefore this was not the first time that our
 dog always held his memory in high rega rd it was the pleasure of our dog to accompany us on
 these drives with the objective as it developed if there were cattle grazing within a moderate distance of the trail
 that he would chase them as fast and far as he saw fit alberta history i summer 1999 out of

 own way the world was a p changing those of us who lived in tli rural areas were trying hard
 to catch up with the rest of the world this was the twenties when a lot of wonderful things t

 ‘ ‘ a ‘ alberta history i summer 1999 ‘ a ‘ x association and who presented several plays a
 year a dance would follow until the wee hours of the morning with music provided by a local band there
 were baseball tournaments which were always well attended there were visits with friends and relatives and sing songs at a
 moment s notice all in all it was a nice period in our lives the twenties was also the time
 that farmers counting on bigger returns mortgaged heir land to buy bigger and better machinery they bought tractors to replace
 horse power and new cars to replace the buggies and democrats and why not prices on farm produce were good
 and the united farmers of alberta were in power what could possibly go wrong well it wasn t long before
 they would find out how wrong they were the change came about on that fateful day in october of 1929
 when the stock market crashed and prices on all commodities plummeted it left everybody reeling in shock it took a
 while for the farming community to let it all sink in many could not accept the gravity of it a
 local farmer who had harvested a good crop that fall found he did not have enough granary space to store
 his wheat hoping for a better price to come he decided to rent a boxcar from the railroad company and
 began his wait that was when the market crashed and the price of wheat began sinking to a record low
 in the end to his great dismay he found he owed the company more for the boxcar rental than what
 his wheat was worth and the difference had to come out of his own pocket neighbours found it hard to
 see a grown man cry when he talked about it but this farmer was not the only one to suffer
 financially others were losing their land and machinery when banks and mortgage companies began foreclosing hard times had set in
 and were not going away having always and cream to sell at the city market it was a three day
 trip and almost every time he would bring back something for our home naturally the surprise would be second hand
 but who cared once it was a dresser another time a beautiful framed mirror which had a crack at the
 bottom the flaw was camouflaged by an oil painting of a bunch of tulips we hung the mirror in the
 family room and were rightfully proud of it but an acquisition that brought endless pleasure for all of us was
 an rca victrola gramophone his master s voice with the big black horn it cost next to nothing because it
 needed repair with it came a boxful of records father fixed the machine in short order and from then on
 we had music to our heart s content we who had only the barest of necessities before were now beginning
 to feel well to do we were sailing on a wave of prosperity and expecting even better times to come
 working along with our parents and our teachers in school we were preparing for an even better life in the
 future as teenagers we had a lot to live for we had school and church picnics there were parties and
 weddings we had an amateur group of actors who were members of the reading hall we who had only the
 barest of necessities before were now beginning to feel well to do we were sailing on a wave of prosperity
 and expecting even better times to come alberta history i summer 1999 dealt in cash our parents were spared money
 so there went my dreams of a but they too felt the pinch they still career it took a while
 to get over my paid their bills and their taxes but we disappointment but when one is young heai d
 more often no you can t have it hope springs eternal there s no money for that bill woywitka and
 i met at a dance the years that followed only kept where he played the violin in a local getting
 worse farmers planted and dance orchestra it wasn t long before harvested but had little to show for it in
 we were being recognized as a couple the fall farm wives worked harder than talking about marriage being in love
 ever carrying out not only their own neither of us stopped to consider what duties but taking over the work
 of an life would be like we were into the third extra hand as well they looked after year of
 the gi eat depression with no their family they raised poulti y and put end in sight in a large
 garden they stooked and helped with haying bill s father had given him a quarter section of land hut we
 had no machinery meanwhile single men wandered or buildings on the place did we stop to around like lost sheep
 in search of think what lay ahead of course not we employment in 193 i my last year in got
 married in june of 1932 when i was school i saw many of these unemployed seventeen and bill was twenty
 two hitching rides on fiat cars and in empty box cars that lumbered past our school as was the custom
 of the time the first when the train stopped at the station wedding was always held at the bride s
 railroad company workers would herd home followed a week later by a them off with clubs but as soon as
 the wedding at the groom s place the train started moving these hapless men money presented at both weddings would
 scramble on board again totalled 420 48 of which we spent on a honeymoon at banff we were well there
 were times when a transient chaperoned on that trip by bill s parents would stop at our house begging for
 a and a half dozen of their friends who meal or a place to sleep on a cold night came
 at the same time in seai ch of my parents never had the heart to turn therapeutic help at the
 banff sulphur away a hungry man or refuse him a place pool to sleep overnight even if his bed was
 only a pile of hay on the kitchen iloor we all stayed in a rickety two roomed with a quilt
 to cover him shack which had a kitchen stove and a collection of miscellaneous dishes and while we had no
 money to spare there cutlery plus several extra mattresses to was always enough to eat we planted a sleep on
 at night being newlyweds we big garden and had plenty of potatoes were given the bedroom the whole idea carrots
 turnips and cabbages mother was to keep down expenses made sauerkraut by the barrel a hog was worth 4 00
 on the market but when while it wasn t the most romantic butchered kept us in meat for a long
 honeymoon i enjoyed the mountain time for nothing was wasted holiday never dreaming it would be another twenty years before
 we would i was now sixteen having completed revisit banif grade 11 1 was planning to go to normal school
 for a second class teaching upon our return home i prepared certificate hut my plans were soon myself for my
 new life there were now quashed for one i was told i was too eleven of us in bill s
 parents house young to be on my own in a big city and including an 84 year old paternal the
 second reason was there was no grandfather and an 82 year old maternal i ft above left preparimmg for winter

 not an easy transition for me i had helped with the work at home but this was different i was
 now a married woman with grown up responsibilities i quite understood why bill s parents hoped we would stay with
 the family there was enough work for everyone but their plans for us to remain with them was the last
 thing i wanted or expected while there was plenty of work there was little cash floating around fortunately bill was
 still with the local dance orchestra and brought home 1 25 for a saturday night s work when the band
 played for a wedding it meant 5 00 to 7 00 apiece depending on the tips the weddings started off
 in the afternoon and lasted till the following morning no one got rich on the pay but it was the
 only cash bill saw as for me the only cash i had was what the old grandfather gave me for
 cleaning his room the dimes and quarters added up at the end of the winter to 3 75 every cent
 of which i saved for the baby i knew was coming in the spring as for the wedding money we
 did not spend it expecting to build our house when the winter was over early in the spring of 1933
 with the help of a local carpenter the house took shape when the money ran out we were left with
 a shell 16 feet by 24 feet finished on the outside with shiplap a layer of tarpaper and siding without
 any insulation the house was hot in summer and ice cold in winter using the bits and pieces of lumber
 left over the carpenter made us a table a bench and a three shelf cupboard two wooden orange crates placed
 side by side completed a good part of our furnishings between what our two sets of parents had given us
 we now had six head of cattle consisting of four cows and two heifers two of the cows had calved
 in winter and the calves were now ready to i above during the hard times of the 30 s people
 had to rely on each other men like blacksmith tony keklak had to extend credit to local farmers and hoped
 they would make enough mnoney from their crops to pay their bills right this was the author s idea of
 a swimming pool for her children in the 30 s they are two year old sylvia and three year old
 allan alberta historylsummer 1999 be sold when we took them in to the city meat market we received 15 for
 the two ready butchered with the 10 bill s grandfather gave us from his meagre savings and the 12 bill
 had saved from his fiddling plus my savings we had a total close to 45 with my savings i bought
 twelve yards of flannel at ten cents a yard two baby shirts two flannel nighties a tin dishpan and a
 pair of scissors the remainder of our shopping included a mcclary kitchen range a bedstead and mattress pots pails and
 pans all bought in a second hand store our last stop was at the burns packing plant where we picked
 up free a large wooden box by attaching legs to the box we had a crib for the baby we
 moved into our home on may 11 th 1933 starting out on a shoestring took a lot of hope and
 courage and even more than enough of plain ignorance on what responsibilities to expect in the future six weeks later
 our baby son was born with a neighbour midwife in attendance under these circumstances we both had to grow up
 fast when i think of it hunger was often with us that first year i put in a garden in
 a stubble field but had a lean harvest in the fall bill put in his crop in the spring with
 assistance from his parents but the wait between the sowing and the reaping was a long one in the meantime
 with the only cash coming on an irregular basis was from playing at country dances we had to depend on
 the woods and meadows like our parents and grandparents did before us we picked berries and mushrooms and were thankful
 for the prairie chickens partridges and wild ducks that bill brought down with his 22 rifle for the other little
 extras we were thankful for the local storekeeper who gave us goods on credit we bought necessities like salt sugar
 yeast kerosene for the lamp flour and rolled oats plus staples like rope nails and twine in the fall after
 threshing the first two wagon loads of wheat went to pay the store bill which totalled less than 50 now
 i quite understood what my parents meant when they said they could not afford something or other but while there
 was no cash around there was no shortage of work fences had to be put up a makeshift shelter of
 rails and straw had to be built for the cattle and horses a pen for the pigs and a log
 house for the chickens romance flew out of the window fast and looking after the baby became a part time
 job when there was so much other work to be done before winter set in bill dug a shallow well
 yards away from the house which froze solid that winter it forced him to haul water for the stock from
 his father s well i melted snow for use in the house in the fall of 1934 1 gave birth
 to a baby daughter and wondered if that would be the norm for every ensuing year i was only twenty
 years old but often felt like a hundred a walking skeleton with the weight of the world on my shoulders
 we milked cows and sold cream for 2 50 to 3 00 for a five gallon can eggs were traded
 for goods at the store at two dozen l or i 5 cents hogs at 4 00 each and a
 600 lb baby beef brought 40 at the same time the price of wheat scarcely covered the cost of growing
 it i suppose counting every penny twice over before we parted with it helped to keep us afloat people we
 knew were losing their land to mortgage companies others were being evicted for nonpayment of taxes the depression was now
 into its fifth year and still going strong we decided if we were to keep on farming we would have
 to drill a well that summer we hired a horse operated drilling rig which kept breaking down but when the
 drillers finally reached a depth of 90 feet the flow of water came in strong and filled the well close
 to the top the drilling plus the cribbing cost most of the wheat crop that fall but it provided us
 with an excellent supply of water for many years to come the rock bottom economy was not the only thing
 plaguing us adding to our misery were years of drought and killing frosts one year in particular it seemed to
 rain nonstop it drowned out the crops and gave rise to never ending clouds of mosquitoes these blood thirsty varmints
 plagued man and beast to protect ourselves we wore netting over our hats and heavy clothing but they still crawled
 under and over into our eyes and noses and even down our throats whenever they got the opportunity horses and
 cattle suffered terribly too they came home bawling seeking relief in the smudge fires we kept going for them that
 year two of our work horses fell victims to swamp fever and died a milk cow had to be destroyed
 because of foot rot if anyone wonders why we didn t pull up stakes and leave then pray tell me
 where we could have gone next year in june a fierce hailstorm swept through the district it mashed the garden
 and the fields of grain right into the dirt eventually some of the grain recovered but the crop was poor
 that year and so was the garden at the same with my savings i bought twelve yards of flannel at
 ten cents a yard two baby shirts two flannel nighties a tin dishpan and a pair of scissors our last
 stop was at the burns packing plant where we picked up free a large wooden box by attaching legs to
 the box we had a crib for the baby alberta history i summer 1999 time my chicks and poults were
 one year followed another and the then came the summer of 1939 and a drowned by the storm which left
 a foot interior of the house still remained feeling in the air that something new was of hailstones and water
 in the yard unfinished one year in desperation i happening as market prices began bought some lime to whitewash the
 inching up but even as the door was during the rest of the 1930 s we who walls and the
 2 by 4 s i congratulated closing on the great depression another worked on the land were fully employed myself
 on how i brightened the place door was swinging open as the warbut had little to show for it we
 were then winter came and with it the annual clouds gathered on the horizon having running out of haywire to
 fix broken coating of frost on the walls as a result lived through a decade of poverty we the lime
 began to flake off leaving were now on the way to a further machinery even harnesses were falling behind a
 mess that lasted for a long time disaster which would last for another six apart from years of abuse i

 winnipeg to edmonton mail route the mail route between winnipeg and edmonton was established about august 1876 the contractor was
 james mckay who resided at silver heights near old fort garry the method of delivery during the winter months was
 by relays of dog trains there were busy men and hard worked dogs all along the route that stretched 1
 000 miles through what was then termed the great lone land organizing this route was not an easy matter and
 the delivery of mails was a still harder one sometimes the drivers would get pinched in a storm and find
 it difficult to make a bluff for a night camp but the mail drivers were trusted men whose ambition was
 to get in on time which they invariably did the winter time was best for getting the mail regularly as
 the delay with storms did not appear so great as that of swimming and crossing the rivers the mail outfit
 usually consisted of two sleighs four dogs each and two drivers pemmican was used for feed both for man and
 dogs each night the dogs would be given about a pound or a trifle over and nothing during the day
 a dog seemed to work best when not too well fed but at the end of a run they would
 then he fed night and morning when winnipeg drivers pulled out they got their relief at shoal lake about 170
 miles away the next run was to fort pelly and the swan river barracks from petty the new drivers took
 the touchwood hills trail and exchanged mails with the men from carlton at mckay s station at big quill lake
 another pair of drivers ran between carlton and battleford and the last and longest run was from battleford to edmonton
 these relay stations were about 170 miles apart at night when the camp was made wood had to be gathered

 what might have been is serious to contemplate a few days ago a couple of members of the ladies aid
 of a prominent city church and a young clergyman with whom they were driving were on the verge of apprehension
 for horse stealing they drove down to witness the sports at the calgary indian industrial school the horse was unhitched
 and allowed to wander away and when wanted for the return journey could not be found the young clergyman who
 is a recent arrival was not the least discouraged by this unseemly conduct on the part of the cayuse having
 no doubt read of the plentitude of horseflesh in the wild west he proceeded to gather in another nag without
 regard for the severe penalties for this class of amusement he attached the misappropriated animal to the vehicle and drove
 up to the school with the most serene assurance to receive the fair passengers they not being very well versed
 in all the shades of pintos brindles buckskins and walleyes did not notice the difference so climbed into the buckboard
 with the sky pilot and drove off but the heat was a short one a short stop was called to
 witness the antics of a certain prominent ecclesiastic of rotund appearance and usually dignified mien who came cavorting after them
 over the prairie like a windmill in a blizzard declaiming that s my horse that s my horse what do
 you think you re doing matters were soon adjusted the young religious demonstrator became completely faded before the great high
 priest and was let off with a caution and the ladies felt like common horse thieves in the hands of
 a vigilant committee finally the old sorrel horse was found eating turnip tops utterly oblivious of the dangers and trials
 of the ones he had so cruelly forsaken and when attached to the rig was given a veritable pilgrim s
