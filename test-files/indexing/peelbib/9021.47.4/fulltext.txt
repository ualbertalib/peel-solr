 taken about 1862 four countrymen to the fur trade in the of them moreover he made numerous years before his
 death northwestern interior of british north alterations of mcdonald s original text america and took extensive liberties in changing his

 transportation and logistics violence and the exhilaration and grossness 7 of fur trade society and they contain some of the
 most vibrant picturesque writing to be found in the fur trade literature by 1791 mcdonald s father had died and
 the youth then about eighteen years of age was under the stewardship of his great uncle general small and his
 elder brother angus a london business man they were acquainted with simon mctavish the dominant partner in the north west
 company and arranged for their ward to begin an apprenticeship in that concern on 19 april john mcdonald sailed from
 greenock scotland in the good ship canada bound for quebec 8 one month before his departure he received a letter
 from general small admonishing him to be modest mild and unassuming to your equals and even to your inferiors acquire
 mild polished and soft manners be assured that modest and unassuming behaviour will far better recommend you than confidence illegible
 and roughness be affable and courteous to all you converse with 9 young mcdonald did not immediately take that good
 advice to heart during the transatlantic crossing he argued with his cabin mate and challenged him to go on deck
 in the dark of night i had pocket pistols on the same voyage he offended another passenger an army officer
 several years his senior who customarily wore his sword when dressed for dinner i told him mcdonald says his sword
 was more dangerous to himself than it would be to an enemy hence began our quarrel about the first of
 june 1791 the ship docked at quebec and probably to the relief of everyone on board mcdonald soon left for
 montreal he seems to have been a very aggressive and abrasive young man and his memoirs particularly for the early
 years of his career are frequently punctuated ouest 4 masson s editing and publishing of the memoirs was an injustice
 to their author unfortunately it was and remains today the most readily accessible version of the autobiographical notes arthur s
 morton the pre eminent historian of the north west fur trade studied the memoirs and commented that they were written
 in the boastfulness of old age 5 although he recognized the poignancy of some of mcdonald s writing he observed
 we are often teased by his successive fightings with beast and man when so much of greater importance could have
 been said 6 morton s comments had an immense influence on subsequent scholarship and his dismissive opinions about mcdonald probably
 contributed to the relegation of the memoirs to the periphery of fur trade studies as a result john mcdonald of
 garth has not fared well at the hands of historians many of whom have regarded the man and his autobiographical
 notes as of little significance but in fact the memoirs have much to offer the patient reader they provide a
 unique insight into the history of the canadian west during its most turbulent period the lateeighteenth and early nineteenth centuries
 they reflect many aspects of the functioning of the north west above this painting by john innes shows a fur
 trade brigade en route to the west right this is a sample page from mcdonald s autobiography alberta history autumn
 1999 with his tales of arguments and physical violence about 15 june recalls mcdonald i left la chine under patronage
 of the late simon mctavish esq in a large birch canoe manned by fourteen choice voyageurs and our cook from
 amongst a crowd of friends and spectators who were there to witness our departure as a great event before the
 times of steamers their destination was grand portage the north west company s inland depot and rendevous on the north
 west shore of lake superior soon after their arrival he had a quarrel with a clerk a large english man
 of the name of harrison mcdonald remembers his antagonist as afterwa rds being under my command and a very good
 fellow but no trader he never could learn to speak french i believe he died in the country if i
 remember right 2 at grand portage john mcdonald was placed under the supervision of angus shaw a wintering partner whom
 he describes as an excellent trader and a man who managed his men and the indians well and a kind
 bourgois to me 3 shaw was in charge of a trading post at moose lake in the upper reaches of
 the churchill river drainage basin about three miles west of the present day town of bonnyville alberta mcdonald accompanied him
 and they got there just in time next day the lake a good large lake was frozen across he immediately
 began his training as a fur trader for there were a good many indians of the cree and assiniboine tribes
 waiting our arrival according to mcdonald he spent the winter of 179 1 92 in physical comfort and dietary boredom
 the accommodations were new chanties both comfortable with plenty of fire wood and good accessories the diet was boring poor
 quality fish and venison sometimes obtained from the indians no bread which i thought rather strange nor any vegetables toujours
 perdrix 4 and not much of that at times 5 in the autumn of 1792 shaw began construction of a
 new fort called fort george on the left bank of the north saskatchewan river in the boundary between the boreal
 forest and the aspen park belt the fort now a provincial historic site was situated about thirtyfive miles north of
 where the town of vermilion alberta is now located mcdonald was assigned to assist shaw and in the fall of
 1792 according to his recollections he travelled by horse and on foot from moose lake to fort george the 1790
 s was a decade of rapid westerly advance of the fur trade in the saskatchewan river drainage basin as the
 north west company hudson s bay company and independent traders vied for the last beaver pelt it bore little resemblance
 to the romanticized notion of the kindly trader bartering beads blankets and pots alcohol tobacco firearms and ammunition were the
 currency drunkenness debauchery violence and death were commonplace despite some of the ugly aspects of furtrade life it was not
 without its beauty and pleasures mcdonald poignantly describes some of its aesthetic and enjoyable qualities he remembers his arrival at
 fort george thus i was as by enchantment transported from rivers and lakes from portages and strong woods to an
 unknown region of the finest prairies the fort was upon the margin of a fine hummock of pine upon a
 rising hill or bank with the noble sascatchwan in front with banks in that place of strong woods for perhaps
 a mile in breadth and twenty in length along the river as it were a shelter for the different kinds
 of deers pa rticularly the moose deers 6 the following spring a brigade of canoes was readied to transport the
 year s return of furs to grand portage mcdonald captures the sense of ‘ 7 • z ‘ 5 ‘

 received word that a rival an old to me to see such a grand river 7 experienced trader david grant
 had established a post at the mouth of the on their return in late summer it was sturgeon river about
 three miles common for the partners and clerks to upstream from today s prince albert leave the canoe brigade where
 the boreal saskatchewan mcdonald was assigned forest merges into the aspen park belt to establish a post in opposition to
 the and take to horse for the final stage of interloper and he and grant passed the the journey this
 i thought the most winter in broils often 2 pleasant part of our lives mcdonald reminisces the riding of a
 swift horse in 1799 mcdonald became a partner in in the fine valley of the saskatchiwan the north west company
 2 and in that abounding in buffloe deers all year he probably participated in the game establishment of rocky mountain
 house near the headwaters of the north during his twenty three years in the fur saskatchewan river and according to
 trade mcdonald crossed the continent the custom of the country he married once and travelled from the north west nancy
 small she was about sixteen and to montreal several times so he was no the daughter of patrick small one
 of stranger to magnificent scenery but the original partners in the north west when he wrote his memoirs so many
 company as well as a distant relative of years later he remembered the fine john mcdonald and an indian valley
 of the saskatchiwan with women from isle à 0:a la crosse their first particular affection child william was born two year
 later and by 1816 she had borne him five in the autumn of 1793 mcdonald s children 22 he makes
 no mention of outspokenness landed him in trouble a nancy or his children in the group of indians had attempted
 to autobiographical notes pillage a neighbouring trading post pine island fort about fifty miles john mcdonald enjoyed telling a good
 upstream from the present city of north bear story his memoirs contain at least battleford saskatchewan mcdonald ten openly expressed
 the opinion that james finlay the wintering partner in charge his best story is contained in the of the pine
 island fort had acted in a memoirs which he dates as 1799 it is cowardly manner tho young he says
 not clear where he was located at that i could not restrain my disgust with time but it would have
 been rocky finlays conduct saying what with 60 mountain house or the first fort good men to have allowed such
 augustus near the present day town of insults angus shaw mcdonald s fort saskatchewan at that time two superior did
 not sha re that opinion species of bear ranged the north mr shaw felt a little angry with me saskatchewan
 river valley the grizzly he remembers bear ursus arctos horribilis and the above john mcdonald of garth is seen here
 as a young man it was painted about 1804 right bear adventures were common in the early west this 1853
 engraving shows john pa user fighting a grizzly bear u alberta history autumn 1999 black bear ursus americanus the former
 was eliminated from all but the upper reaches of the river the latter however is still frequently seen many persons
 who have encountered a bear in the wilderness can attest that it can be an exciting even frightening experience but
 bears represented more than fear and excitement to mcdonald they were a challenge to his manhood and a test of
 his leadership he was not content to let sleeping dogs lie he felt compelled to kill the animal whenever possible
 it was a point of honour and to do otherwise he thought would lessen him in the eyes of his
 men perhaps he was right he tells of a young canadian gentleman his name decoigne a very clever young man
 who left the fort to go hunting with a man of the name of daniel 23 they bagged an elk
 the kill was cached to protect it against scavengers and they returned to the fort the following day daniel went
 to retrieve the meat was greeted by a bear and severely wounded was no hopes of him no help for
 it he was a fine stout fellow half scotch and half canadian he was not expected to live one of
 the men le blanc a very dashing smart fellow and a good hunter a good shot vowed to avenge daniel
 s death he said that if no one went with him he would go alone i ll go mcdonald replied
 and we shall see which of us two will be afraid finding courage in the heat of the moment twelve
 men set out to do battle with the beast one dechamps led followed by le blanc mcdonald armed with his
 fusil and pistol was third the rest of the entourage followed in indian file with arms all ready 25 the
 bear was found at the carcass of the elk upon seeing it dechamps exclaimed mon dieu voila and in so
 exclaiming turned round to fly however le blanc fired his two balls took her fairly in the breast mcdonald shot
 her behind the neck then all the other men except one la liberty fired after she was down thinking she
 was not killed enough another bear then appeared charged the men and when it was but two paces from mcdonald
 la liberty dispatched it with a shot into her belly but i would not fly mcdonald says all the fifty
 lives were at stake my cha racter would have been about noon he came home in a dreadful state he
 was seen at a distance without his horse and coming on very slowly some of the men suspecting something wrong
 went to meet him and found him all torn to pieces his scalp in ringlets down his face and neck
 dreadfully mangled at least twenty wounds in his arms besides the head his story was that he was leading his
 horse on by the bridle amongst small brush that a bea r had suddenly sprang upon him that his horse
 had started from him that he had no time to mount then that the bear pummeled him and went off
 that he turned to fly but that she came again and pummeled him as we saw and left him again
 that she came the third time that he roared so loud that she left him the third time and saw
 him no more he then made his escape with his hood over his torn head in a short time he
 became delirious and there his story was that a bear had suddenly sprang upon him that his horse had started
 from him that he had no time to mount then that the bear pummelled him and went off that he
 turned to fly but that she came again and pummelled him as we saw and left him again alberta history
 autumn 1999 u ruined for ever during the melee someone accidentally discharged his weapon and the shot singed mcdonald s
 blanket coat daniel survived his wounds he recovered but he never could carry a load so well his front was
 tender ever after 26 an exciting day and the stuff of many a good yarn for years to come there
 is a leitmotif of violence throughout all of mcdonald s memoirs ruthless and senseless slaughter of animals attacks by indians
 on fur trade posts and brigades physical beatings and killings i recollect a man disobeying me and struck him down
 flat also another i displaced his jaw bone 27 thus begins the autobiographical notes for 1800 mcdonalds notes are replete
 with examples of his use of strong arm methods and he sometimes appears as a man of short temper and
 violent predilections however his method of dealing with recalcitrant subordinates was not exceptional the partners and clerks of the north
 west company often used physical force against voyageurs and indians as punishment or to enforce discipline mcdonald remembers the pursuit
 and killing of a horse thief and the tale is another note in the sad refrain of bloodshed and death
 that permeated the north west fur trade it occurred near fort island at the beginning of the nineteenth century the
 island is located in the north saskatchewan river about fourteen miles southwest of the town on elk point alberta a
 herd of about one hundred horses jointly owned by the north west and hudson s bay companies were pastured on
 the north bank of the river early in the spring the horse keeper one big cardinal so called crossed i

 where about one hundred horses were grazing amongst low hills hummocks of light wood a beautifull hilly country interspersed with
 small lakes abounding in all kinds of wild geese swans ducks c it was an early hour in a short
 time he appeared on the banks calling that upwards of twenty of the best horses were stolen 2 a posse
 was formed the chase began the culprit noted one eyed rascal was tracked to his lair at river dog rump
 so called 2 and took to his heels into the strong woods and when at a certain distance where he
 thought himself safe he turned round to have a shot at myself mcdonald when my pilot observing his intention leveled
 his gun at him and sent his ball through his heart no one seems to have mourned the death of
 the blind of an eye villain they were not sorry as he was a dangerous kind of a person amongst
 the natives mcdonald then promised the victim s widow and children he would clothe them if they came to the
 fort and everyone came forward to a man and shaked hands with me we got our horses and returned to
 the island 3 in 1802 angus shaw retired and mcdonald was now master of the largest department in the north
 3 a year later after accompanying the canoe brigade to grand portage for the annual rendevous he was granted a
 year s leave he continued eastward first to montreal and then via boston to london where he stayed with his
 brother angus during the winter of 1803 04 a full length portrait of him dating from that time shows a
 selfassured fine featured dapper young man the artist did not depict his right arm as crippled after his return in
 1804 he determined to take four canoes and about twenty five men and go up as fa r as i
 could and take my quarters on the bow south saskatchewan river to explore the country and trade with the blackfeet
 and mississourie indians on his ascent of the river he came to a remarkable place called bois d orignal or
 moose woods i never met with a more beautiful spot he exclaims 2 that site now known as moose wood
 flats is near the modern city of saskatoon saskatchewan he also describes the great herds of plains bison along the
 river it was the buffaloe rutting season also and coming down like an avalanche those behind pushing the others on
 down the banks we were obliged to keep large fires and tire guns to keep them off sometimes a few
 yards only from the tents and canoes 3 mcdonald and his men established new chesterfield house near the junction of
 the south saskatchewan and red deer rivers north of the present day city of medicine hat if fur trading on
 the north saskatchewan river was dangerous on the south saskatchewan it was deadly peter fidler a hudson s bay company
 trader and explorer was trading there in 1801 02 when there were two separate massacres of furtrade company employees in
 the first six men were killed on 3 march 1802 the scalps of two canadians and ten iroquois were carried
 in triumph by the fall indians past chesterfield house 34 and on mcdonald s return in the spring of 1805
 three of his men were killed near moose woods it is not certain where mcdonald was assigned the following year
 1805 06 he was probably at isle à 0:a la crosse on the churchill river during the following two years 1806
 07 and 1807 08 he was back on the noble sascatchwan he was then in his late thirties and in
 poor health i had been a martyr to rheumatism since i left england in 1804 and but little able to
 bear all this he writes however i had no option i must have done it i tried all remedys but
 at last was advised to make a visit to the doctors in montreal correspondence between mcdonald and his brother in
 law william mcgillivray indicated that it was unlikely he would be able to return to the north west he spent
 the winter of 1808 09 in montreal but i found the doctors doing me no good pills upon pills calomel
 upon calomel until i sent them all to the d l 35 but he was not finished with the fur
 trade after sending them all to the d l he returned to the north west to resume his duties as
 a wintering partner in 1809 10 he was in charge of the upper red river department which included the territory
 surrounding the qu appelle and upper assiniboine rivers i did not liken it much he says tho it suited the
 state of my health better nor did he approve of his predecessor s style of management big mcdonell a most
 powerful man but a man who did not command his men as he might an easy man of no above

 it was now late we had to guard the property all night next day before we could get all in
 one order the third day we left again left no one behind 7 in the late summer and autumn of
 1811 mcdonald commanded an expedition taking supplies to the western slope of the rocky mountains in support of david thompson
 s explorations in 1812 he was determined to retire from the country or at least to visit london again and
 stayed with his brother in that city until march 18 l 3 and still he did not retire the north
 west company was planning an expedition to the mouth of the columbia river to assume possession of fort astoria a
 trading post established by the american john jacob astor it was an attempt by the nor westers to open trading
 relations with the lucrative east asian market on 25 march 1813 mcdonald and donald mctavish another wintering partner embarked from
 portsmouth aboard the isaac todd to astoria to open a trade with china directly 3 a few days before departing
 mcdonald signed a contract with jane barnes a portsmouth barmaid to accompany them the agreement stipulates that she consents to
 do needle work that may be necessary on the passage and elsewhere when nothing happens to prevent such for this
 she was to be paid the generous salary of thirty pounds sterling yearly and every necessary articles of clothing suitable
 for the country 4 mcdonald neglects to mention miss barnes in his memoirs and the nature of their relationship is
 unknown but by spring of 1814 she had formed an alliance with donald mctavish the adventurous exertion 36 at this
 time the autobigraphical notes begin to show a somewhat gentler john mcdonald someone who now commanded his men by tact
 and persuasion rather than fists once again as in the spring of 1805 the canoe brigade was attacked by indians
 as they were leaving with the year s return of furs and provisions mcdonald recalls we made up all for
 our departure intending to leave six men in charge all summer in about an hour an alarm was given that
 the boats were attacked men all killed i called for a horse to be saddled and i mounted soon met
 our cooper with an arrow in his cheek some two or three others i rode full speed came to where
 the boats were landed some of them were scattered about some wounded we found a poor woman he wife of
 one man who had himself received an arrow in his belly this poor woman had been ravished by above interior

 autumn 1999 1 h sl erks lii the skles by hugh a dempsey it is strange but true that when
 people become conscious of the skies overhead they begin to see things that puzzle them this was true after world
 war two when flying saucers or unidentified flying objects were seen throughout the world the onset of this obsession parallelled
 scientific preoccupation with man entry into outer space the belief seemed to be that if we could explore other worlds
 then other worlds could explore us and as people looked to the skies they saw or they imagined they saw
 the unexplained the same thing happened in 1897 when world attention was drawn to salomon a andree and his attempt
 to reach the north pole by balloon he set out in mid july from spitzbergen on the north west coast
 of norway and simply disappeared he was an expert balloonist and had excellent equipment so people began to speculate that
 he had missed his mark and prevailing winds had carried him into unexplored regions if he had floated someplace why
 not western canada balloons were not new to the western prairies particula rly to the winnipeg area ce sandin had
 made a grand balloon ascension between fort garry an airship is seen floating over the calgary exhibition grounds during a
 demonstration by professor strobel in 1908 alberta history autumn 1999 and william drever s store in 1860 and by the
 1890 s hot air balloon demonstrations had become a familiar sight in the prairie city in 1892 t j cash
 and his assistant blanche matteson had made two ascensions at the winnipeg fair before a fire destroyed their balloon 2
 a year later a balloon ascension featured victoria bates rising to five hundred feet and parachuting to the ground 3
 and in 1896 professor menier gave demonstrations of balloon ascensions and pa rachute jumps at river pa rk in winnipeg
 4 however these were not balloon flights where aeronauts tried to travel across country they simply filled the balloon with
 hot air raised it straight up until a pa rachute jump could be made and let the balloon float down
 to earth these theatrical performances caused no great excitement but andree s disappearance was news it was telegraphed around the
 world and was featured in western canadian newspapers about two weeks after the balloonist s disappearance andrew henderson a farmer
 near whitemouth manitoba swore he saw a large balloon slowly drifting in a north easterly direction the balloon seemed to
 him to be twice the size of his house and had a large boat hanging from it 5 the story
 created considerable excitement so the farmer was interviewed for more information a reporter wrote the evening was rema rkably calm
 and clear every object showed a steely distinctiveness against the northern sky and not a cloud marred the fine blue
 expanse mr henderson was standing at the door of his barn and was taking a glance around the sky as
 any farmer will do when his ing eye detected a lrge oblong object sailing slowly suspended like mahomet s coffin
 between heaven and earth gradually he made out the car then he saw the huge sail swing slowly round and
 come into view astonishment held him spellbound again and again the ghost like sail swung and jibed full in view
 showing its enormous proportions all the while it was slowly drifting with great distinctiveness across the clear blue of the
 northern sky a week later the free press again raised the question of the mysterious airship when it published the
 following letter from r m scott of point douglas manitoba in case some of your numerous readers may have noticed
 something similar at some other point i would draw your attention to a peculiar matter noticed on the night of
 the 5 th about 11 p m just before retiring a something that at first looked like a falling star
 appeared directly north of alberta history autumn 1999 above one of the earliest newspaper references to extraterrestrial phenomena in the
 west occurred on august 28 1860 when the nor wester published in winnipeg reported a meteor like fireball passing three
 hundred feet over the settlement right early balloon flights such as this one at calgary in 1906 saw the craft
 to straight up then drift to earth early skyward sightings however were of objects travelling at high speeds far right

 who saw it said it had a powerful headlight and red and green lights at the rear the mysterious object
 was seen again at morse and when the news was flashed to telegraph operators along the railway line other sightings
 were reported just after 1 00 a m the operator at swift current observed the phenomenon stated a reporter the
 outline of the ship was seen quite distinctly by those abroad at these places at this early hour but it
 was too far away to be identified it is descr ibed as a cigar shaped machine carrying one white light
 in front two green lights one third of the way back and two tail lights 2 the object apparently followed
 the main line of the cpr and shortly before 5 a m it was seen by the telegraph operator at
 irvine on the alberta saskatchewan border this time it was heading south travelling about sixty miles an hour from there
 it disappeared again there was wild speculation as to the identity of the flying object one journalist suggested it was
 the balloon america ii that had set out from st louis and was last seen heading north however that balloon
 never came near saskatchewan ending its flight at st john s newfoundland 3 strangely two women at fernie b c
 reported seeing a similar phenomenon near their town an hour or so before the saskatchewan sightings according to the fernie
 free press an airship has been seen by miss creighton and miss wyatt from wilkes boarding house on wednesday night
 october 26 th 1 about 11 30 it appea red to be over it began innocently enough with a newspaper
 report that a mysterious flying machine or airship had been seen around stettler and didsbury late in 1909 0 no
 one could explain it until someone remembered that the brother of louis bleriot the famous french aviator had a ranch
 near the red deer river speculation arose that louis was in alberta and experimenting with a new aircraft however andré 0:andre
 bleriot assured the public that his brother had never been to alberta and so the mystery was unsolved the stories
 took a more dramatic turn in october of 1910 when a report was received of a mysterious aircraft travelling at
 great speed from saskatchewan to alberta it was first sighted shortly after midnight on october 27 th passing over moose

 types of airplanes was death this cartoon is from the calgary herald july 16 1910 far right this article in

 august 4 1914 western canadians again looked to the skies this time in fear and apprehension aeroplanes already were being
 used in european warfare and who could know what the huns may have invented on august 25 th edmontonians claimed
 that a large airship passed over their city in the silent watches of the night 22 a reporter stated whether
 it was a balloon or aeroplane or a dirigible balloon nobody seems to know definitely the gathering darkness making it
 impossible to distinguish the object which is said to have been at a great height some of the observers thought
 it was a toy balloon and state that a red light was suspended from the bottom others said that they
 could plainly see something revolving yet another declared that there were four men in it and that it was brilliantly
 lighted up scores of citizens claim to have seen the nocturnal visitor which they classed as an airship four days
 later calgarians saw their own mysterious object dubbed by the press as the flying dutchman of the air 24 according
 to the news telegram at 12 o clock some one thing at an enormous height shot straight to the north
 with such swiftness that in ten minutes or so it had vanished completely from sight 25 the newspaper office was
 flooded with calls from people who had seen the strange phenomenon according to a reporter rumors and stories regarding the
 mysterious visitor are rife of the hundreds who saw the small white speck away up in the clouds many cling
 to the belief that the heavenly sailor was nothing more nor less than an aircraft of some description the stating
 that no aeroplane had ever existed except in the confused mind of its inventor 20 so what did the people
 of moose jaw swift current and fernie really see no one knows even after the first real flights took place
 in edmonton and calgary in 1911 stories still appeared of aeroplanes or balloons being sighted where none existed in 1912
 the editor of the rocky mountain house echo asked did you see the air ship that passed over this district
 last thurs evening about midnight the great ship passed almost directly over the town travelling at a fast clip her
 lights could be seen flickering in the sky for over half an hour rh macdonald who was out to red
 deer last week camping about five miles out from that town reports that the great ship passed over there on
 that evening about eleven o clock 2 the editor believed that object was a new aircraft making a trial journey
 from winnipeg to victoria although by 1912 no canadian aeroplane was capable of making such a long flight over the
 rockies shortly after great britain and her dominions declared war on germany on above the first real heavier than air

 their share and then some of everything within reach and if they are going in for team work there will
