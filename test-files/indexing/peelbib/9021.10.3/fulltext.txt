 to spend his last years in campanionable solitude with his curios his books and his memories sometimes as the reverend

 history or in the annals of the com but the pedlars were not idle they pany the indians conceived the
 idea built new posts further up the north saskatchewan and for a time made of making the traders wholly dependant
 upon them for provisions things very difficult for the hudson s bay company in pursuance of his in with this

 hudson s bay company no mercy would be shown also suffered a threat needless to say which at manchester house

 but it such happenings made it to some ex was certainly the custom for most tradtent necessary for the rival

 the settlers from ontario were familiar crown council and mr magee s horses with cheese factory operations so the iad
 to be destroyed this was a serious erection of a factory was a natural oss to us as there was

 of 1892 i started to go i mentioned that our family lived on o the school three quarters of a

 his son hayward who was about twenty requently were diseased therefore we years of age had become interested in ivoided
 them wild life was a great freighting for the hudson s bay cornource of livelihood during the first pany it
 was only natural that a young rear the financial resources of the colony chap like myself after seeing the activ
 vere extremely limited we ground ity about edmonton and with a desire to see the country should become fascin old
 on the fourth of july i started witlated by this business in this connection hayward roswell to go to athahascc
 it should be appreciated that before the landing and before school opened ir building of the branch line railways the
 fall i had made three trips on the everything was moved over land into second trip i took my father
 at leas the northern settlements and hudson s i thought i did to show him the road bay company post
 by horses and oxen really i think he wanted to learn whai freighting was a big business a good danger
 i might be exposed to on so long two horse team could haul two tons a trip when we returned
 to edmonton twenty two miles a day a yoke of on that trip we hired a fellow by the oxen
 would haul about one third more name of lannie maxfield and father sent b ut would take two or three
 hours longer this boy and myself back on the third to travel the same distance the roads trip with the
 idea of making a few doland trails during the busy seasons would lars so we could buy something to eat
 be occupied by scores of teams going during the first winter my father beand coming along the main routes pri
 came interested and through the covate stopping places would be located operation of the roswell s we started usually about
 a day s travel apart it making trips to athabasca landing was not uncommon to see thirty or forty under
 my father s direction and superteams put up at a stopping place for the vision i gradually assumed greater renight
 the freighter usually carried feed sponsib ility we moved all kinds of grain for his teams and would pay for
 freight and heavy equipment the latter the overnight stabling where hay was consisting largely of machines engines usually supplied many
 of the stopping and boilers brought to edmonton by railplaces consisted of a fair sized shack way and then transported
 overland to equipped with a stove which provided athabasca for shipment up the river for welcome warmth during the winter
 af northern destinations during the klonter stabling our horses we would go into dike rush of 1898 there was considerable

 wagon for 65 00 a little hay and ate our lunch which not my father gave me a team of
 horses and infrequently was frozen some harness that is how i got started each freighter usually operated two on my
 own much of my freighting was two horse teams and two sleighs it between edmonton and athabasca a was considered
 a much better practice to distance of approximately one hundred distribute the loads over two sleighs miles requiring five days
 going and hauled by a team each than to overload three on the return when roads wereone sleigh hauled by
 four horses by good the former method the roads were pro during freighting days i made a num tected and
 maintained in better condi her of rather extended and exciting trip tion throughout the winter heavy that i well recall
 one involved a trimn freighting was usually done during the from the little grist mill on the stur winter when
 the ground was frozen and geon river at the time my father anc the ice on the rivers and lakes

 mill a sayday in 1892 when i was eight years mill was built and operated by th same overshot water
 wheel as the grist they acquired the grist mill and immill the grist mill operated for the mediately undertook to
 rebuild it they most part in the winter and the saw put in a bigger flume and larger stones mill

 were the big lake by the catholic mission sheridan and fennie lawrence who where the dam had been washed out
 by were cousins fennie lawrence visited high spring freshets on several occasions the mill and examined the stones while it
 should be recorded this mill did they had been used considerably they a thriving business in those days it were
 much bigger and better than anywas a far busier place than edmonton thing they had in the north so he
 puror fort saskatchewan during the win chased the stones as and where is ter farmers from as far away as

 long as five or milion on the peace river a distance of six days waiting their turn to have about
 five hundred and fifty miles their grist ground there were no tele fennie lawrence undertook to transphones in those days
 you could not predetermine how busy the mill was port the stones and accessories he had if the weather was
 fine the roads good no experience in operating or moving and the people in need of flour everyone heavy equipment
 however he got the stones loaded onto two sleighs at the would descend upon the mill with their mill and
 started on his way when he grist and simply await their turn to have it ground back on the homestead

 of the poles tracted to load the stones which took would be chained across the sleigh rack us two days
 and deliver them on the thus extending at right angles to the river bank at fort vermilion road one or
 two men would ride or bear the trail went through athabasca down on these poles to counter balance landing up
 the athabasca and slave the load thus avoid tipping when rivers along the shore of slave lake going down a
 steep grade and in order and on to the town of peace river then to keep the load under control
 the lead we followed the river to fort vermilion team on one sleigh would be brought going on the ice
 wherever possible to the rear of the sleigh that was being this trip took me twenty two days going moved
 the neck yoke carried by the and possibly fifteen days to return rear team was chained to the rear of
 good time was made because the trail the sleigh the harness was always was located on ice for the greater
 par equipped with strong breeching and tion of the distance and no serious storms martingales thus in going down the
 or blizzards occurred steep hill the rear team could hold back what happened to those stones i don t as
 much weight as the team in front know i believe they were erected on with one man driving each team
 a the farm of sheridan lawrence north heavy load could b e eased down a very west of the fort
 vermilion across the steep hill with little danger of mishap peace river lawrences were what we in fact a well
 trained rear team would called in those days free traders they hold back the load without a driver on bought
 furs etc in opposition to the other occasions we would brake the load hudson s bay co and they used
 flour going down hill by wrapping a chain in bartering with the indians i saw about the sleigh runner or
 by chaining sheridan lawrence quite frequently in a pole or block thereto it was tricks later years i believe they
 only ground like these that we had to resort to when about four or five hundred sacks of flour delivering
 heavy loads like the amera year the population could not utilize ican abel engine to brick and boyd at more

 from edmonton edmonton district he got the engine for the hudson s bay co it consisted out to our place
 but could take it no of tea flour sugar groceries etc these farther after consultation with my were heavy loads
 this trip from edfather we agreed to deliver it to peace monton to fort st john one way took river
 town when loading the wheels thirty five days and i was storm bound were removed the boiler loaded onto on
 slave lake for three days one sleigh the wheels freight etc the klondike rush of 1898 was a busy loaded
 onto another the engine was time for the freighters this was the delivered to brick and a partner by the
 event that put edmonton on the map name of boyd who was an engineer and people from all parts of
 canada the quite a machinist united states and even england with al now you can readily imagine that types of
 conveyances were on their way considerable care had to be exercised north we were operating a stoppinc in freighting a
 load of that type the place at the time and met a lot of these centre of gravity was high
 and there people they were really in a frenzy was a danger of upsetting on the road there was considerable
 heavy equip anyone who has been to peace river ment such as boilers and boat equipwould have some appreciation of
 the ment being brought in a number hoc precipitous hills and banks that sur the idea that they could build
 boats a round the town to move this load athabasca landing and take their equip of several tons down the
 steep slopes to ment down the river but they were no the river bottom required extreme care aware that to
 pass pelican rapids eight y and foresight miles north of athabasca landing al the klondike gold rush of 1898 meant
 incrsased activity for the author s freighting business this party is seen as it prepares to leave edmonton early in
 the year the trip to the yukon if completed would take them more than a yeas freight had to be
 unloaded and port we reached lac la biche about three aged and reloaded below the rapids o clock in the
 afternoon as we arrived the empty boats when water was high the mail was just coming in hauled enough could
 be piloted down the by twenty six dog teams having five rapids by a man named shott natural to seven
 dogs each and a total of 155 ly the larger the empty boat the more dogs this was a great
 sight the dogs danger there was in navigating the were unhitched and turned into a yard rapids on the down
 trip on the return surrounded with a high board fence trips the empty boats had to be towed up the
 rapids the florida water was unloaded by the mushers and local hands in a matter for three years i held
 a contract with of minutes this was to be a part of the hudson s bay co to haul mail
 from their christmas dinner lac la biche to edmonton the hudson s i shall never forget that trip after bay
 co held a dominion government taking delivery of the mail the hudson s contract to deliver all the mail from
 the mackenzie river district twice a year bay officer in charge of the post came to me that evening and
 said lawrence to certain fixed points one of the points i don t think you should stay in here of
 delivery was lac la biche 190 miles northeast of edmonton the winter de tonight he was really concerned about the
 fact that i had taken delivery livery had to b e in edmonton by new of the mail which contained
 many val year s day i would take a load of freight out and bring the mail back r uable
 parcels and that i was now the custodian of same the mail bags conalways had to give myself ample time
 tamed many parcels of silver fox skins in order to make delivery in edmonton on december 3 1 st each
 year i spent some parcels were worth fifteen hundred dollars or more such a load repre christmas on the road
 trailing through sented a lot of money and not until i the bush delivered it to edmonton did the hud
 on my first trip to lac la biche in the son s bay co s responsibility cease he fall during
 prohibition days i had 4 800 told me where we could go for the night pounds of florida water on
 one wagon it was a hudson s bay company hay stack about five miles out of lac la made of
 cariboo skins the fur wa biche we followed his advice and fine short and dense but light in weight camped
 by that stack of hay all night because of the amount of walking done it was cold but we had
 a good sleep when freighting in cold weather light we arose early in the morning had weight clothing was essential
 robes breakfast and were on our way what made of lynx paw skins are claimed tc happened that night in
 lac la biche i be the warmest kind of robe you could never knew i can imagine those spread a
 lynx paw rob e out on the snow mushers from the north and the local lie down on the one
 half and cove folk saw to it that it was a real occasion yourself with the other half and that
 is all the bed you would require on another trip to lac la biche the main part of our load
 was flour we the two hazards that constantly conhad planned a noon stopover at sin fronted freighters during the winter
 clair s who kept a stopping place at particularly when traversing ice on lakes the lower end of goodfish lake
 this and rivers were blizzards and the danwas the sinclair that homesteaded on ger of breaking through the ice i
 was land down on 110 th avenue now part a witness to one tragedy hayward of the city of edmonton
 when we roswell and i were freighting flour to arrived we learned that sinclair s daugh the north roswell had
 a big team of ter had died and preparations were geldings they were a trustworthy being made f or the
 funeral under the team and they would follow the lead circumstances we felt it was not proper load without a
 driver on this occasion that we should impose ourselves on as we went down onto the slave river them so
 we moved on we were getting we had to make a quick turn onto the hungry the weather was cold
 we ice hayward s team for some unknown pulled off the road fed our horses and reason did not follow
 the road and were the next step was to build a fire get thrust out onto the ice over a
 deep chana frying pan and begin cooking the nel in the river the team and load bacon and making tea
 in the mean broke through the ice the team drowned and the flour was a partial loss time we reached
 up and pulled down a bag of hudson s bay flour broke it if a break through takes place over
 open mixed in a little baking powder deep water and the teams cannot be with the flour poured some warm
 water detached from the load the load is alon the mixture stirred it up to the right most sure to
 force or drag the team under consistency and here was our bannock the water or the ice to avoid this
 when the bacon was fried the b annock possibility as much as possible the wise went into the frying pan
 and the bacon freighter would have a ring welded into grease if you have been starving the draw bolt located
 on the tongue of hungry on a cold wintery day and miles the sleigh a rope was attached to the
 from human habitation you know how rinc and fastened to the front of the good such a meal can be
 i don t recall rack or load in a case of danger the ever being as hungry as i was
 on that teamster could jerk the rope and pull occasion and when i relished a meal so out the draw
 bolt and release the team much from the load had roswell been on when we arrived within ten miles his
 load he might have saved his team of lac la biche we stopped overnight at another trick was to choke
 the horse another sinclair s he was a son in law by pinching the nostril or with a rope of
 rev steinhauer of the white fish when choked the horse would float or the water and could in this manner
 be mission assisted to safety i have been asked how we dressed to in 1911 i married miss sarha ferguson
 withstand cold weather when on long of namao in 1912 i quit freighting tha i winter trips we used a
 woolen material was the year the railroad arrived in which we called duff le something like athabasca and put an
 end to the busia hudson s bay blanket to wrap about ness we moved out to my father s farm
