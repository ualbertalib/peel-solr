 the 4 th meridian by robert a logan editor s note this article by mr logan won second prize in
 the society s recent pioneer writing competition to people flying over alberta much of the country appears to be part
 of a gigantic checker board because of the layout of roads and property boundary lines but how many persons flying
 above these roads in comfortable aircraft or travelling over the roads in swift automobiles ever pause to ponder upon the
 transportation problems of the pioneers involved in producing the gigantic checker board most of the vast grid work of survey
 lines was established by men known as dominion land surveyors before the province of alberta took over control of the
 public lands within its boundaries such land was known as dominion land and was administered by officials of the federal
 government at ottawa or their representatives in the field before land was considered open for right to show the letters
 d l s after homesteading it had to be surveyed his name he had to study special subby specially trained
 men under the jects such as spherical trigonometry direction of the surveyor general of astronomy land laws and the manual
 canada a quarter section of 160 of surveys and he was required to pass acres was considered to be sufficiently
 both written and practical examinations surveyed for homesteading when two before becoming a d l s corners had been surveyed
 and marked on the ground the smallest unit of the usual procedure was for a young land surveyed by dominion
 land sur man to pass a series of written examinaveyors was usually a block two miles ticns then to serve
 an apprenticeship north and south by one mile east and of three years as an articled pupil of west a
 commissioned dominion land surveyor then he had to pass an examina in making surveys of dominion land tion which lasted
 seven days six hours the magnetic compass was not used in per day the establishment of boundary lines as had
 been done in earlier surveys in knowing how to keep the lines parts of the eastern provinces of canada on
 course by careful observations on the instead the directions of all survey lines stars was only part of the qualifications
 were controlled by the stars and a of a d l s he had to know how to dominion land
 surveyor had to be a hire provide for transport and manage competent practical field astronomer to a party of from
 twelve to twenty one be a graduate civil engineer was not men for many months away from sufficient qualification alone
 to permit sources of supply these lines did not a man to be given a commission as a follow natural
 transportation routes but dominion land surveyor with the were run northward and westward mr logan is a pioneer dominion land
 surveyor and resident of lake charlotte nova scotia he is author ci the booklets the cree language as it appears
 to me and cree language notes straight across country regardless of country of alberta west of edson rivers lakes hills
 or valleys my connection with the survey of the beginning in manitoba basic con 19 th base line began in
 the old cecil trol lines running due north known as hotel in edmonton in the first week of numbered initial
 meridians were estab march 1912 i had spent the months lished at intervals of approximately of january and february as
 first as 150 miles measured westward along the sistant to hugh matheson d l s run international boundary the eastern
 fling a transit on correction surveys and boundary of the province of alberta is traverses between the athabasca and the
 4 th meridian the macleod rivers where the coldest weather we experienced while living in because of the curvature of
 the earth tents was only 60 below zero these meridians were not parallel but if continued northward would all meet
 when our work was completed the at the north pole also a line started party was disbanded and i went
 to edwestward at right angles to the meridian monton where i wired the surveyor and continued as a straight line
 for general in ottawa that i was available 150 miles or so to the next meridian for appointment to another
 survey party would strike far to the south of the lati while awaiting a reply i lived at the tude
 of its starting point cecil hotel which was then a great meeting ground for surveyors it was a block of
 1 c nd approximately six owned by major p r a belanger miles square was called a township d l
 s inspector of surveys the man it contained 36 blocks termed sec with whom i served as articled pupil tions
 each being one mile square in 1910 and 1911 before townships and sections were it had happened that just about
 the surveyed very accurate control lines time i arrived from the west guy h known as base lines were run
 from one blanchet d l s had arrived from the numbered meridian to the next one to north where he
 had been busy for a the west these lines roughly 150 miles year running base lines in the vicinity long
 were 24 miles apart of fort mcmurray he knew that he a base line was not a simple straight was
 to run the 19 th base line in the line it was a series of very straight summer of 1912
 and when his work lines each being six miles in length was completed his party started to move plus road
 allowances at the end of to athabasca landing for refit before each such section the course of the line starting
 out on the new job he had was deflected north a very definite travelled fast ahead of the others in
 amount theoretically all such deflec order to pick up supplies and men and tion points had the same latitude take
 them to the meeting point at atha the base lines were numbered north basca landing one of his assistants a
 ward from the international boundary n narraway was returning to ottawa thus the base line crossing calling so mr blanchet
 wired for a replacement lake north of athabasca was termed both telegrams to ottawa received quick the 19 th base
 line west of the 4 th replies i was instructed to report for meridian it was run in 1912 by
 guy duty as second assistant to mr blan h blanchet d l s chet i did so and was informed
 that my perhaps a story on how this line job would be to run the level to was run may
 give some idea of the determine elevations and to establish transportation facilities then in use and bench marks along the
 line some idea of a few of the day to day mr blanchet purchased supplies and problems in the life
 of a dominion land hired six or eight men then we started surveyor nearly fifty years ago out to meet
 the southbound survey party at that time i had not passed the at athabasca landing or the landfinal examination for
 dominion land ing as it was generally called at that surveyors but i had passed the pre time the railroad
 from edmonton to liminary examination and had served the landing was under construction but two summer seasons and one winter
 did not reach the town until some time season as an articled pupil in mani later our supplies and bed
 rolls etc toba saskatchewan and in the foothill were transported by four two horse teams and wagons as the road
 was in bad shape and the wagons heavily loaded we men walked the whole distance from edmonton to athabasca landing
 the journey took four days that was the road followed by many settlers headed for the peace river country and
 there were frequent stopping places where we could cook our own meals and spread cur bed rolls at night we
 arrived at the landing just before dark one evening and about two hours later blanchet s party from the north
 arrived the hotels were crowded when we arrived and we were lucky to find space for about a dozen men
 to spread their beds on the floor of a large warehouse but about thirty men occupied the space that night
 next day we put up our tents on a vacant lot we spent about a week getting reorganized equipment repaired
 and the crew sobered up then we started eastward for lac la biche using horses and bob sleds to transport
 our freight we had 21 pack ponies to move our gear after we could no longer use the sleds there
 were twenty one men in the party we had our own tents which we put up each night sometimes in
 pretty deep an indication of the country in which the survey took place can be seeis by this view taken
 by mr logan in 1912 this is the 19 th base line west of the 4 th meridian looking east
 we went around the eastern end of by the time we reached the end of lac la biche and from
 spencer s place the line everything was slush a foot or there we headed north making our own more deep
 it was no use trying to keep trail we passed through the chipe our feet dry we wore heavy socks
 wyan indian village at heart lake and buckskin moccasins to let the water where we hired several indians to guide
 out for weeks life on that survey us to our starting point of the survey party was misery day and
 night as we one of these indians was a very seldom spent more than two or three intelligent young man
 named philip nights in the same camp getting clothes francis he spoke only a few words of dried was quite
 a problem and as soon as the snow went the flies came english but in addition to his native language
 he spoke very fluent cree i the actual running of the line was knew a few cree sentences and he
 in the able hands of sidney fawcett taught me many more he remained d l s who ran the transit
 and weather my friend until his death only about permitting took daily observations on five years ago and we exchanged
 many the stars to make sure that the line was letters written in cree syllabic symbols not running north or
 south more than until death put an end to our corre an inch or two per mile of westward spondence
 distance in this he was of course we eventually picked up the end of assisted by the chief but the
 latter the 19 th base line about thirty miles was a very busy man directing the work west of the
 4 th meridian the line had of the party as a whole a base line been started some years earlier
 as a survey party consisted of a number of winter survey but the party became sub parties more or less
 independent snowed in and nearly starved but interlocking with each other they included the following crews campsite tance along the
 line and to place cornerand trail locators trail builders packer posts at half mile intervals the chaincrew line cutting crew
 chaining crew ing or measuring was done with a steel levelling crew mound builders and tape graduated in surveyors chains
 of camp crew 66 feet each one one hundredth part the locators scouted the country of a chain was called
 a link as a ahead to find routes for the trail making check on the accuracy of the measurecrew to
 follow they had to be expert ments all distances were again meanavigators by instinct rather than in sured with a
 steel tape graduated in struments as they were usually three feet if the two measurements did not miles or so
 ahead of the end of the agree they were re measured until they did line it was their job to
 locate campsites not too far north or south of where the the chaining crew measured horiline would strike yet not
 so close that zontal distances but the levelling crew we would have to lower tents to let the measured vertical
 distances and carried line go through as it actually did hap along a line of levels or elevations and pen
 on one occasion established markers of a permanent the pack trails had to avoid mus nature for future reference as
 with the kegs as much as possible because cross chaining all work was duplicated by ing muskegs usually involved making
 check levelling pack trail bridges sections of cordu the mound building crew used picks roy about 18 inches wide of
 tree trunks shovels and axes to erect corner monulaid length wise of the trail and ments every half mile along
 the line covered with moss and with an ankle where an iron post had been planted high railing to keep
 the ponies from by the chainers a mound five feet slipping off square and three feet high was built the
 packing crew had to care for from earthy material dug out of four the pack ponies see that they got
 pits forming ci regular design with the enough to eat and were not eaten up mound each pit was three
 feet square by flies and when not engaged in mov and 18 inches deep often in the hoting camp were
 continually moving sup test days of summer permanently frozen plies ahead in relays ground would be encountered under the the
 line cutting crew included the top layer of moss in muskegs transit man and picket man and a bunch another
 small crew scouted the of strong armed men with axes and country for twelve miles on each side of brushhooks
 like all hands except the camp crew they left camp at seven o clock in the morning and returned at
 all possible modes of transportation were six o clock in the evening six days a used by the survey crew
 during their season in the wilderness here the author at left is with week ed butler on a trip upstream
 with freight in it was the duty of the chaining crew the summer of 1912 at this point they are
 to make careful measurements of dis below athabczsca landing the line and tried to map prominent bear almost bumped noses
 neither apfeatures in it parently having any thought of anything except where he was putting down his last but by
 no means least was the feet the bear stood up and snorted camp crew that kept twenty one hungry and
 almost rolled over backward as he men well supplied with plenty of good jumped off the trail into the middle
 of substantial food two meals each day the stream in camp and each man packing his own sid was so
 surprised that he was lunch for his mid day meal to be eaten almost in camp before he remembered wherever
 he might be the big revolver hanging from his belt the chief as the head man of a after that
 he left the revolver in camp survey party was always called not the bear has been forgotten but sid s

 supplies and meridian from the end of the line n iil and strive to keep everybody in we moved by
 pack pony to mirror landgood humor and pulling together ing on the athabasca river where our earlier latitude observations had
 whole outfit except the horses was located fairly accurately the place picked up and transported to athabasca where our line
 would cross the atha landing on a large paddle wheel steambasca river about 60 miles below atha boat it burned
 wood which was basca landing supplies for our use picked up at places here and there along the bank of
 the river on the western side of the river had been transported there by one of the when we arrived
 at athabaseci several mississippi river type steam landing we found the town to be quite a boats then plying the
 river different place from what it had been when we left there in march the rail we crossed the athabasca
 river road had entered the town and a buildearly in the summer by swimming the ing boom was on horses
 and using rafts to transport our camp gear and ourselves surplus items the gear that we had left behind were
 cached to be picked up and taken where our line crossed the river had to athabasccr landing not been picked
 up by the steamboats and as we had to wait a few days for our line struck calling lake where
 the arrival of the pack ponies sid fawit was about six miles wide and we cett and i were given
 a sort of holiday had to continue the line across the lake trip to paddle a big 21 foot freight
 canoe by triangulation with the help of some down the river and bring the freight local indians and their canoes
 back between calling lake and the 5 th with one other man ed butler we meridian we ran through country
 that went the sixty miles down river in one had more bears to the square mile than long day this
 was before the days of any other place i have ever seen they outboard motors or union hours going did
 not bother us personally but every back up river however was a different morning we would find pickets knocked matter
 it took four days of strenuous over and instrument boxes and tripods labor in many places we had to mauled
 unless covered with two or three track using a long line attached to feet of heavy branches the canoe two
 men staggered along the shore tugging at the tracking line early in the season sid fawcett car while the other
 man steered the canoe ned a big 45 revolver hoping to shoot with a paddle a bear one evening coming
 to camp along the pack trail which happened to when we started running the basebe at the edge of a
 creek about forty feet line in the spring there was so much wide at a sharp turn sid and a
 big slush and frozen ground on the first 25 mile section that ottawa agreed to let young man of edmonton
 named reginald us go back later in the season to con henry struct the corner monuments with two men i
 was sent back from athabasca at that time neither of us in his wildest dreams could have guessed what landing
 to do this work fate had in store for us that a few the pack horses were being taken years
 later in time many thousands of miles from edmonton and nearly three to a large meadow south of fort mc
 murray to spend the winter and be ready miles up in the air together we would be the first men
 in history to fly an to start out on another survey in the armed aircraft bearing a north amenearly spring
 they carried us as far as can indian name in battle against an spencer s place at the east end
 of lac la biche we hired other horses to take enemy us to heart lake but from there we were

 tools we examination for dominion land surhad cached a supply of food in the veyor but a few days later
 i started n spring on the line about 20 miles from another trip to the heart lake and 19 th
 our starting point and we were expecting base line country to reach it earlier than we did we were delayed
 because we found so much fred seibert d l s was to run a frozen ground under the moss in
 most base line in the country between the of the muskegs where we had to dig the 19 th base
 line and fort mcmurray i am pits we ran short of food but luckily not sure which one it was
 but supplies it was the year of rabbits and we had to be taken in by sled from lac had
 a 22 rifle rather than waste time la biche the hudson bay company and effort in going ahead for grub
 would do the freighting provided someat the cache we decided to live off the body was sent to have a
 cache located country for one week we lived on and built on a certain river at a definite nothing but
 rabbit but when we reached latitude to be determined by astronomiwalking distance of the cache we made cal means it
 was recommended by mr up for it blanchet to make this latitude determination when we finished the job we had
 with one man i was to go to athato walk about sixty miles to the nearest basca landing by train
 thence by house this was the home of mr horses and sled to spencer s place at the spencer at
 lac la biche which was east end of lac la biche where i was to getting to be a sort
 of second home to hire dog teams and drivers to take us us after resting there a few days we
 north to a latitude i was to determine went around the lake to the settlement by means of a sextant
 and an artificial where we hired a team to take butler horizon at that point we were to build and
 me to athabasca landing clyde a log cabin cache and when we re white stayed at lao la biche and
 spent turned to lac la biche the h b c the following winter trapping near freighters were to follow our
 trail to where the base line crossed a couple of the cache with supplies small rivers one of which is
 now shown on the map as clyde river and the all this was done we had five dogother is shown
 as logan river a lake trains of five dogs each at the start about six or seven miles long was
 given to haul fish to feed the dogs etc at the name clyde lake the last part of the trip
 we used only three trains of dogs i arrived back in edmonton by train from athabasca landing in time to
 the snow was over three feet deep enroll in the science course class of everywhere and it took three men
 on 1916 at the new university of alberta snowshoes walking ahead of the dogs where one of my classmates was
 a to break the trail no one rode on the toboggans all took turns in breaking horse and wagon horse
 and sled horsetrail back on snowshoes toboggan hauled by dogs canoe raft large wood burning much of the time the
 temperature steamboat and by train was around 30 below at night we slept in the open without tents except in
 the thirty years following 1912 one or two nights when we stayed in there were amazing changes in translog cabins
 of indian trappers portation facilities the last time i saw the country of the 19 th base line and at
 one such ctzbin warmed and athabasca landing was in 1942 from lighted by a large fireplace i startled a high
 flying airplane on a non stop the occupants when i performed a few flight from fairbanks alaska to great magic
 tricks topped off with a trick falls montana in 1912 it took four using a small carbide lamp something days
 to travel 100 miles in 1942 it unknown to the indians i had put some took less than half an
 hour dry carbide in the lamp before i asked our elderly indian hostess if i might no doubt most of
 the men who helped have a few cold ashes from her fire run the 19 th base line west of
 the 4 th she said i could have a pailful if i meridian have passed on to a land wanted
 it i pretended to put some where muskegs are unknown where ashes in what looked to her like a small
 mosquitoes have no sting and bulltin can then i asked for a spoonful or dogs and black flies have no
 bite two of tea from the pot always near the fire i put the tea into the tank both guy
 blanchet and sid fawcett of the lamp and lit the resulting gas lived long to carry out many important the
 light was far brighter than any surveys and explorations in the north artificial light the indians had ever seen and
 i believe both are still alive the three days later two indians overtook names of some of us were left
 unsung us and told our men in cree that they while the names of others were left on been told
 about this wonderful medicine the map of alberta in addition to the man s light and they wished to find
 out river and the lake named after clyde about it one said if i could only learn white goodwin lake
 was named after the secret of making a light like that our chief packer frank goodwin the out of ashes
 and tea i could make a station on the railroad near where it fortune out of it crosses the 19
 th base line now carries the name of behan in honor of our on the way back we spent several
 famous cook bill behan as does a lake days at the house of mr spencer i have a few miles
 to the west little heart forgotten his first name but his son mar lake near heart lake has been reyin
 was in charge of our dog drivers named logan lake and moose lake has i always remember mrs spencer as
 one been renamed fawcett lake of the nicest women i ever met there were several grown up children the when
 the first dominion land surones i remember by name were marvin veyors began placing that peculiar patand george and their
 sister tannie tern on the prairie of what is now the george deschambeau was driver of one province of alberta
 there were vast dog train and so was james mckay herds of wild buffalo roaming the wide open country then
 came a time when i returned via horse and sled from there were more dominion land sur lac la biche
 to athabasca landing and veyors than wild buffalo roaming the then by train to edmonton land but just as the
 buffalo faded away so in his turn did the dominion land i arrived in edmonton just one year surveyor until
 now in alberta one is and one week from the time i had left just about as extinct as the
 other the that city on foot to walk the one hundred wild buffalo vanished leaving little miles or so to
 athabasca landing in evidence of his sojourn in the province that period of time one year and one but as
 for the dominion land surveyor week my means of transportation in the it will be a long time before the
 evidence ordinary life of a dominion land sur of his having been here will have faded veyor of those day
 had been by foot away uses of native plants by the blackfoot indians by alexander johnston we tend to think
 of the blackfoot indians in the days before white settlement as hunters hence meat eaters to the near exclusion of
 other types of food they were largely dependent on the buffalo for food as well as for shelter and many
 other everyday necessities but there is little doubt that many plants were used although the full story will never be
 known one reason for this is indicated by denny who has written it is a great pity that some of
 the means and medicines used by the indians in their different treatments of disease were not noted and use made
 of them the indians are however very hard to gain any information from being most secretive particularly with anything regarding
 their medicine about which they have much superstition 1 it is possible by knowing the uses is logical to suppose
 that many plants of plants and the characteristics of plants were utilized in curing sickness or in known to occur
 in the blackfoot country relieving the pangs of hunger cause to make at least an educated guess as and effect
 were undoubtedly noted by to the species concerned another dif the medicine men and others and the ficulty lies in
 the fact that many early knowledge passed from generation to writers used common plant names in generation their discussions of
 indian culture these common names differ from place to place it is with these limitations in mind and from time
 to time as an example that this article has been written moss 2 several writers have stated that the has
 been used as the authority for indians used ash from the mountains in biological nomenclature used herein the construction of
 bows and lances ash fraxinus spp does not occur in the area as ihe blackfoot were a nomadic we associate

 house 2 public hall 3 clerk s house 4 trade shop 5 meat shop 6 servants house 7 place where
 a small band of snare indians were exterminated with the exception of one woman the x s mark the chimneys
 the main building also appears in the horetsky photograph on page 16 suicided at cottonwood creek henry zky photograph is
 52 feet by 22 feet house about thirty three years before divided into three rooms viz the cook in 1895
 three or four people were house or kitchen the public hall and the buried there in the ‘ 80 s
 and ‘ 90 s but clerks quarters each with a chimney their resting places were not marked in another structure
 cornering the first was any way all the other graves were the second of the two we located shown very
 much older that was quite plain on moberhy s plan as 12 feet by 26 from examination jasper house was
 feet divided into the trade shop 12 feet not occupied after the ‘ 60 s except for by 16 feet
 with a chimney at the end short periods once or twice a year and and the meat shop storage 12
 feet by for the two years of swift s residence 10 feet in 1928 henry john moberhy the cornering this
 again to the southeast chief factor who rebuilt the jasper post was the last building next the river 12 in
 1857 8 sent me a sketch of the build feet by 14 feet which he marked serings as they stood
 in his time he was vants quarters in charge intermittently from 1854 to 1861 at the time the sketch was
 made in 1846 paul kane spoke of the post he was ninety four years old as consisting of three miserable
 huts when dr hector saw it in 1859 a couple this sketch shows three buildings of years after moberhy rebuilt
 it he the main building shown in the horet compared the buildings to swiss chalets moberly does not show the
 location i felt hoth to leave the site of jasper of what i call the okemow or master s house
 but there was other work to do house which stood an exclusive dis walking in the deep ruts of the
 old pack tance to the left the remains of this trail we got back to devona station and seemed very
 old totally covered by heaped on the back of our gasoline steed earth and vegetable growth and aban we got
 off the speeder about a quarter of doned many years ago moberly s draft a mile south of henry house
 station on apparently represents those structures the canadian national the name which he rebuilt in part perhaps henry house is
 legion but this one from the timbers of the okemow house had no historical significance except as dr hector indicates
 that they all hived a sort of courtesy memorial of the tradtogether in the main building as mober ing posts
 my object was to locate ly discloses in his sketch henry s winter house this was the house established on
 the west side of the in a letter which he wrote me in 1929 athabasca some distance south of the
 h j moberly says when i first went confluence of the snaring river the to jasper house in the summer
 of 1855 plentiful horse feed there made it a there was an old iroquois dominick better wintering place for the
 horses karayinter the last one alive of a band than the old fort east of and on the sent out
 from montreal by the north opposite side of the athabasca higher west company as hunters this man had up later
 apparently this or some place served in the british army in a number in the vicinity was known as the
 horse of battles with the americans after ranch or an annex of that ranch or peace was declared he engaged
 with the cain prnent de cardinal after jacques northwest company and came to jasper cardinal for a time its presiding
 genius in 1814 the hudson s bay post he and for whom jacques river is named means nw co and
 forgets the transfer to h b co was subsequent to 1814 amongst others david douglas the as far as he
 karayinter knew had botanist travelling east with edward been built in 1806 by william henry ermatinger in 1827 mentions jacques
 it is strange how in certain writings the cardinal as being sent up the pass with date 1806 persists for
 the building of horses to help ermatinger s party across henry house the portage to henry house where they were
 to take canoes not henry s viewing the post in 1868 from the winter house which we are about to
 opposite side of the river lord milton locate but the one at the parting of the and dr cheadle describe
 it as surround ways to yelhowhead and athabasca ed by a how palisade standing in a per pass fect garden
 of wild flowers mr mac the point at which we were aiming aulay who was in charge told them was
 a how plateau less than half a mile a story of a wolverine who had eaten long up to about
 fifteen years before the windows which were of parchment 1928 sunwapta said that faint traces these travellers mention finding a
 tree of a hog building were still to be seen inscribed with the names of some of there we walked
 up the grade of a spur the cariboo emigrants and a statement used during the construction of the railthat they
 had crossed the river at that way then up over the top of the plateau point three weeks before 16
 th june 1863 and down the other side we then separ i have not heard that the tree has ated
 and quartered the ground each way ever been re located without finding anything changing sides we quartered again over the
 pos in 1872 when rev george grant of sible area finally after several hours the sandford fleming expedition saw search
 i thought i saw an outline dis jasper house there were only two log tinguishable by the different colour of
 houses locked and shuttered by that the grass i signalled my confrere we time the place was opened only twice
 a both went over it and round and round year when the traders came up from it finally lifting the
 grass we found log edmonton to collect the furs from the dust along a line of about eighteen feet indians
 and supply them with ammuni the sun sank a little lower at a better tion and stores angle for our
 purpose enabling us to discern the other three sides of the building by the different colour of the grass there
 clearly discernible by the different colour of the grass as we stood in a certain position with regard to the
 sun apparently the building had been about 18 feet by 16 feet no remains of a chimney or cellar were
 found there were no stones anywhere near for the construction of a chimney which no doubt had been built of
 mud and wattles a fire had run over the place at one time scattering cinders about and helping to confuse
 the issue as to the position of a chimney i brought away some of the log dust and a few
 decayed splinters several inches long these are apparently tamarac favoured still for foundation logs the log dust showed that the
 building had been older than either the cemetery or the buildings at jasper house a further proof that it was
 the old ranch or henry s winter house we were without instruments of any kind except our watches i have
 been unable to get a plan of the spur but the position of the site is about 800 yards slightly
 west of southwest of the end of this abandoned spur and over half a mile west of the athabasca sketches
 in my notebook place it in my own mind so that i could easily re locate it it corn henry
 john moberly s name is closely linked with the history of jasper house serving as factor of the post intermittently
 from 1854 to 1861 he later wrote a book when fur was king describing his life in the fur trade
 the dangers and hardships of the expedition sunwapta had to return to his off icial duties so i continued my
 investigations alone manded quite a view the fact that it was the location of a mere ranch not a trading
 post accounts for its distance from the athabasca river springs were plentiful there about for stock watering purposes we returned
 to our steed which all this time had been lying on its back in the ditch we had been given
 a clear track until three p m but it was now eight o clock and darkening fast the railway ran
 around shoulders of the mountains overhanging the wild waters of the athabasca with at no point a view of more
 than half a mile of track we watched both the back and the forward track but at that a train
 came up suddenly behind us around a rocky cliff we leaped pulling the speeder after us a few seconds ahead
 of the train that being without sustenance for sixteen hours except for two chocolate bars and a few drinks of
 spring water represent later that month accompanied by swift i made some investigations on the site of the moberhy survey
 camp between the old horse ranch and jasper village on the same west side of the athabasca somewhat south of
 a point opposite the mouth of the maligne all the sites after the first few years succeeding the discovery of
 athabasca pass were on the west or heft side of the river where there is a wider intervale this camp
 was established in 1871 2 by walter moberly civil engineer and brother of h j moberly the fur trader walter
 moberly was engaged in surveying a trial line for the c p r by way of the yehlowhead pass the
 reports of the investigations made at that time this depot to be known as athabasca proved of value forty years
 later when depot situated on heft bank of athathe grand trunk pacific and canadian basca about four miles below the
 mouth northern now the canadian national of miette river and some 21 or 22 miles made use of the pass

 says it was made for a hudson s upon by cattle and humans for twenty bay company officer years and
 the outlines which should still be traceable were trampled and by the growth since its hopping and mutilated its probable
 age one would imagine it to have been trimmed in the middle of the natives sometimes spoke of these the

 referring to finally applied was the post at the miette s house that is his residence junction of the clearwater
 and sason the east side had used the small h katchewan whose ruined chimneys still for house stand a point
 to consider is that the desig milton and cheadle evidently called nation miette s house is certainly not the gray

 miette s house is very wide side for the last half day of the journey the cellars we found are

 widen into to be taken then again the names the bottoms upon which is built on the jasper house and
 henry house are west side of the athabasca the village printed in on the east side of the river of
 jasper and on the east side jasper seeming to indicate that the posts were lodge and the golf links there
 whatever the dispute about henry lord milton and dr cheadle after house jasper house was never even camping on the
 east side of the atha supposed to be anywhere but on the basca for some days in 1863 at the
