 decision by the united states court concerning hoffman s appeal might have been different if the arrests of little bear

 that little bear and lucky man had been exempted from the amnesty because of the frog lake killings 6 the

 tried to settle into the new life most of the families were western crees who had originally been with little
 pine or had been paid at hobbema or fort pitt only a few had been with poundmaker thunderchild or the
 other battleford bands when little bear arrived at hobbema he was immediately dissatisfied with the arrangements he believed his people
 were owed treaty money since 1884 and was disturbed that although they were allowed to settle on the bobtail reserve
 their status was unclear little bear sought the help of the rev john mcdougall and early in 1897 they went
 to ottawa to discuss the issue en route little bear told a reporter he thinks his people have been slighted
 by premier laurier in the hurry and fuss of weightier matters he wants a clear cut agreement made with from
 the time of his return until 1908 little bear tried any means available for supporting his people and securing them
 a permanent home either in canada or the united states in 1905 he wrote to the indian department in ottawa
 ask from the time of his return ing for permission to bring his followers temporarily to the onion lake reserve
 until 1908 little bear tried any and from there to select a new reserve for themselves he also insisted that
 they means available for supporting be paid their back annuities that they receive government support until they his people and
 securing them were settled and that any indians of mixed ancestry be permitted to take halfa permanent home either in
 breed scrip and withdraw from treaty if they wished to do so canada or in the united states the matter
 was discussed in ottawa and most of the requests denied including in 1905 he wrote to the indian back annuities
 and the rig ht to take scrip instead the government passed an or department in ottawa asking der in council
 on july 22 1905 which authorized the crees to return to canada for permission to bring his under the following
 conditions 1 the indians were to return to followers temporarily to the him as to treaty payments and govern the

 first regina while deane was there in the 1880 s was re placed as adjutant then he was idoubt that
 he was a controversial personality he understood the need for i military style discipline within the force but found it
 far easier to accept the idea i of authority when he was giving the i orders than when he was
 expected to i submit especially to those he considered i unfit for their superior position as a i commanding officer
 of a division how i ever he was largely his own boss and a ver y competent one at that
 if he was too i valuable to annihilate it was because of i his excellence in the field a few
 officers may have been as skilled as deane in the petformance of the multitudinous tasks of police command but no
 one was better of course deane was not merely a moun service 1883 1914 was published about tie he had
