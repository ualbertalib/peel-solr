 colourful as any in canada alberta is generally thought to be a prov parties to make a comeback no party
 in ince where politics are subject to occasion alberta having held office and having been al volcanic upheavals alternating with
 long once defeated has ever returned to power periods of stability this is certainly a correct description of the history
 of political the first era was that of liberal dominparties in the province there have been ation lasting from the
 achievement of provthree great eras of provincial politics mark incial status in 1905 until the liberals ed by three critical

 most spectacular feature wheat marketing apparatus and farmers of this history has been the thrice repeated had gotten out of
 the habit of voting liberal downfall of governing parties with a long because of the federal union government tenure in
 office and the failure of such in the war years in these hard times the thomas flanagan is associate professor

 relative permanence of alberta s liberals this time the new party was wil human and physical geography ham aberhart s

 the provincial administration was handed first under mr aberhart and then under over to the liberals in order to organize
 the first election so the part y got a head start ernest manning their control of the province was not
 seriously challenged until on provincial patronage but even without 1971 in that year peter lougheed s renas these advantages the
 liberals undoubtedly cent progressive conservatives won an up would have been strong in alberta in this set victory unexpected by
 most observers period as they were in the other prairie this time there seems to have been no provinces the
 liberals were known in the easily identifiable cause for the electoral west as the party of the farmer of free
 change other than the retirement of mr trade and of the great immigration boom manning in 1969 and the hard
 work of the the conservatives were more closely identified with urban manufacturing and financial conservatives interests in the 1906 census
 the combined on this showing alberta certainly seems population of calgary and edmonton was to merit its reputation for dramatic
 changes only 12 percent of the alberta total the however there is another side to provincial liberals were in their
 own milieu in such politics which needs to be considered al a rural province though parties come and go the

 when a gentleman of a very delapidated and down at the heel appearance shambled in and with an apologetic manner
 handed the bartender a black bottle and requested that it might be filled with the best seagram the man behind
 the high counter looked rather doubtfully at the shabby figure before him but did as desired placed the bottle on
 the counter and demanded the price he of the shabby genteel appearance however intimated with a most ingenious air that
 he had no money at present but would return with sufficient of the needful if he were allowed to take
 the liquor with him not by a jugful thundered he of the white apron what the sam hill do you
 take nie for get out of here and don t let nie see your face again timidly and with an
 air of most abject self abasement the suitor for credit stole towards the door but as if struck by an
 alert afterthought he said please give me back the bottle that at least is mine all right take it and
 get out quick returned the bartender emptying the bottle and handing it to the man who disappeared with great celerity
 at the door of the bar room he was joined by another gentleman of the same type and together they
 retired to the secluded precints of time city and broke the bottle disclosing a sponge from which they extracted a
