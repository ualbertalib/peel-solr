 along the grand trunk pacific and great northern r ailways for a distance of some 450 miles bot h east
 of edson and west into british columbia then in 1919 father louis was asked to take charge of the missions
 on the coal branch a branch line of the canadian national which ran south east of edson for some eighty
 miles to the foot of the rockies this line built in 1912 carried coal from the huge deposits which had
 been found at the turn of the century the country is rugged and life on the branch was not easy
 in fact a decent road connecting all the coal branch towns from edson to mountain park was not completed until
 1950 ver y little has been written about father louis although here are still a few old timers amund who
 knew him well and religious archives in edmonton contain some information but of greatest importance for an appreciation of this
 missionar y is what he himself wrote a well educated man he even taught greek in the seminar y he
 wrote constantly the provincial archives of alberta in edmonton contain a half dozen in 1588 whl bishoi vital grandin w
 ls fl volumes of his personal diar y huge ledgers all a tour of fance raising funds for his alberta
 ims the pages of which are completely filled with his sions his words had a powerful effect on a fifteen
 fine and precise writing it is especially this jouryear old student louis culerier so impressed was nal which provides a
 portrait of this extraordinary he in fact that he decided to devote his life to man and of the work
 he accomplished mission work in western canada shortly thereafter the priest is thrown on the high road of the he
 left his homeland and went to ottawa to pursue mission without money he wrote without a his religious studies which
 eventually led to his portable chapel without horses he has no lodgordination to the priesthood in 1897 these were ing
 no chur ch and no means of building church he preliminary steps in a life of hardship sacnfice or vestr

 large suitcase on his back while a catholic priest from religious indifference and on his chest was a large sack

 some lived in heart rendering isolation contained his portable altar and everything else he father louis described for instance hat
 needed to say mass and the sack held his personal belongings he once mentioned casually that his a month ago
 i walked 20 miles during my day to go baptize an infant when i arrived load weighed seventy five pounds

 nurse this catholic his work as pastor was not easy in an anonyfamily lives in isolation in the bush t
 hey have no neighbors mous story for children which father louis had entitiled the journal of tonton meric he father
 louis himself existed for years in difficult described the manner in which the priest was someconditions at edson he lived
 in a corner of the times greeted he said that the priest church in a letter in 1916 to bishop
 emile legal was at the coal mine at lovett he was visiting he said that since mareh i have slept
 ‘ in an the homes of the miners he had been told that a lcove but in november because of
 the cold there must be some catholics here he knocks it will be imprudent to continue such a practice at
 the door when he visited coalspur on the coal branch come in says a rough voice there were a half
 dozen men drinking beer he lived in a small shack attached to the church well what do you want says

 along the railway track from one mis any catholics here sion to the next at mountain park he lived for

 several years in a dank cave he dug under the for a priest chapel in contrast he said in a
 letter of 1913 the situation was clear retreat in the midst without rancour hat i have a vicar he came
 of wild laughter to edson once he never r eturned undoubtedly in a passage of his journal he meditated on
 the things are too primitive shortly after in edmon difficulties he encountered ton he wrote here i am at st
 joachim s pres my journey in april of 200 miles on foot was byteiy after six weeks of continuous jour
 to ronan peavine greencourt whitecourt neys i am devoured by bed bugs it s fatigue poor wads mishaps bad luck

 hey don t the man who suffered these hardships was tall help to settle t he turmoils which harass us
 and well built and strong he was also humble and the unlucky mishaps which hinder good oh hat quiet with
 no gift for social conversation one man hike of a mile and a half over deadfall it s who knew
 him said that it wasn t easy for father damnable louis to be so poor and to constantly witness one
 part of his pastoral work which he clearly poverty in his missions but the priest was always liked was teaching
 the catechism to the young a and this witness insists always in good woman from luscar who received her first
 comspirits he told also how father louis often left munion from father louis told how he had built coalspur on
 foot after sunday mass since there a sort of spring roller blind on which he had painted was no train
 on sunday to walk thirty miles to biblical scenes beginning with the creation he he next village would slowly unroll
 the blind explaining to the witnesses also remember that when father louis children the meaning of each scene then to
 conleft on one of his long hikes along the railroad elude the catechism lesson he would play his father louis
 culerier is seen here after returning from one of his frequent trips his trusty suitcase rests on the lower shelf
 at left favourite hymns on his beloved flute he gave an rum to a group of sick men at a
 sawmill it was account of his visit to one family his belief that rum was the only good remedy for
 there are five children i said mass this morning the flu three days later the men had returned to at
 6 00 this is an isolated family which lives work father louis said only that he had had a job
 alongside the track the father is a railroad fore to do and he had done it man we have hymns
 some catechism arithme there am examples by the hundreds in his jourtic drawing writing games because one must make the
 day bot h instmctive and pleasing nal of the long trips he took often by horse or dog and to
 this passage he added a fine little lesson team but usually on foot for instance in april i feel that
 we are preparing a rooster for our sup 1915 he was at wildwood waiting for a wagon per things are
 not always this good but when to take him the thirty miles to gmencourt but the the sauce is lacking
 for he pot there is the abun roads were impassable so he started to walk he dant sauce of the
 good heart travelled nineteen miles that day in the mud ten his diaries often described the miserable condi miles the
 next and forded a small river as well tions in which people lived but without ever focus a few months
 later he commented i awoke at ing on his own privations there is catechism to 1 00 a m train
 on time mass at 8 30 at a farm be taught everywhere he wrote i stop to see following a
 trip afoot and fasting of course of families which are isolated poor badly housed 16 kilometers pack on back in
 the snow this hike where the children need religious instruction i say took me five hours mass on a kitchen
 table on a sewing machine with one passage in his journal summarizes some no liturgical pomp i meet families which
 are very typical journeys good very christian and very poor in the here we are dec 13 1917 i have
 just arrived backwoods from a number of trips which trips put on your all those who knew father louis during
 his mittens to hear my story on tuesday dec 4 years of missionary work in western alberta about thirty five
 kilometers by sled wednesday emphasize the immense physical effort which he dec 5 pack on back and twenty kilometers in
 the evening thursday before noon ten brought to his ministry for example in 1918 dur kilometers on foot pack on
 back a nd then a short ing an influenza epidemic he left mountain park m ission with a family friday
 sixteen kilometer s during a very cold night and walked thirty three by sled and return to peers by noon
 miles along the railroad line to bring a bottle of father louis also travelled by train on both the grand
 trunk pacific and the coal branch line but louis trudging along the railway tracks with his often these trips were
 more an affliction than a help heavy pack strapped to his back his tired kind for example after a week
 long series of trips east ly face was always wreathed in smiles he never enqutred of a man to which
 church do you of edson by sled and on foot he returned to belong he never asked for alms he
 didn t have son at 4 30 saturday morning he continues to when he built his churches at cadomin i
 wait for the train from 9 30 a m to 5 00 p m luscar mountain park bnile pocohontas and
 arrival at lovett on the coal branch at mid jasper he citizens of those towns came forth and night mass
 sunday at 10 30 catechism helped without being solicited they would do monday i wait for the train all afternoon
 at anything for the old priest as they affection 5 00 p m we are told that the train has
 died ately called him in return he would do anything another will come from edson to tow it away for
 them 3 to be absolutely certain i return to the lovett the difficult life which father louis led also was
 station at 2 00 a m the train did not arrive till filled with adventures for this missionary 11 00
 p m tuesday immediate departure for edson by way of coalspur which we reach at however such adventures were merely
 obstacles 5 30 am wednesday finally on thurs to his daily work the priest described many in day we leave
 coalspur at noon and arrive his diaries while those who knew him could tell at edson at 4 30 what
 a ballad of late trains all of others one such adventure took place on the this is caused by the
 cold 50 to 60 c of frost athabasca river near the village of pocahontas father louis writings include a detailed
 list of thirty miles east of jasper at this point the the posts and missions which he visited from athabasca
 is quite broad father louis described carvel thirty three miles west of edmonton to ed his experience son and further
 west to jasper and south west on on december 20 21 1919 i was at pocahontas the coal branch to
 mountain park there are on the evening of the 21 st water ran on the ice familiar names duffield seba
 entwistle obed and at some places it was enxling the ice at about pocahontas as well as names which have
 today 3 00 p m on sunday december 21 while daydisappeared bright bank burtonsville poison light was still plentiful i
 went on to the trail left by travellers the train which was to take me to creek lovetville hargwen bedson
 and others he was able to visit many of these places by train and recorded beside each name the distance
 by rail from edmonton or edson the number of families at each place their nationality and how often he had
 visited them thus we see that at bickerdike ten miles west of edson there were two american families comprising five
 people that he visited three times and celebrated mass in their homes at mile 25 on the coal branch there
 was i a polish family of five which he visited once this list mentions hundreds of such visits thus it
 s not surprising that in a tardy letter to bishop legal he wrote that i am like the trains ‘
 late staying up at night waiting for the train sleeping en route passing or losing long hours of the day
 waiting for another train how does the good lord find ‘ anything to his glory in all this that s
 his ‘ secret r those who knew father louis treasure one image of him which shows the essence of the
 mis ‘ sionary one acquaintance described him in these words anyone who was in that vicinity between the father culerier
 sets out from mountain park with his years 1914 1931 will remember seeing father nephew marc edson no longer goes
 through pocahontas but money from his relatives to pay for his enterprises through bedson which is on the other side
 of the the number of voyages he undertook by all possiriver i picked up a ten foot po le with
 which ble means especially on foot and to try to calcuto probe the ice while advancing the tracks of hose
 who had passed by the evening before were late the influence of this unusual man on all those easy to
 pick out even where the water had who knew him become a deep stream i surveyed to left and right
 let the last word for now be that of a resident for a quarter of n hour a nd thought
 i would have of the coal branch j w horan a non catholic to return to pocahontas for two days
 to my great who published this tribute after the death of his old regret then i suddenly saw a hundred
 meters downstr eam a tree trunk lying across the cunent friend a polish man had joined me let s go
 see the beloved father louis culerier o m i has i said to him he got there before i did
 saw that preached his last sermon never again will we see it was a ford and reassued by thr ee
 tr ee tmnks him picking his way across the railroad ties of lying across the current he started to the
 coal branch never again will we send for cross without taking off his boots which him in our hour of
 need filled with water the water was ten cen it is doubtful if any other individual missiontimeters deep but he
 ice below was solid i saw ary was held in such high esteem as this modem him do it i
 thought of moses who had crossed day saint some day his name will rank with he red sea with dry
 feet i took off my boots hose of father lacombe father leduc and and socks and rolled up my pants
 and under bishop gnrndin i have known hundreds of priests wear i took a foot bath in water which in
 my time some were pious some were generseemed lukewarm then i walked on sand for ous and ot hers were
 lovable but father louis about a hundred meters to a tree tmnk i sat there was everything a human being
 could possibly be and wiped my feet with an old piece of newspaper it is small wonder then that he
 will be missed and which i had in my bag a handkerchief served as mourned by ever y chnstian from
 edmonton to a towel and i put on my socks and boots i had pnnce george b c dry feet
 the walk which followed kept my feet kindly old preacher the friend of warm i did not catch the slightest
 cold from this mankind father louis he saint of the in this matter a realistic straightforward branch account father louis
 described his winter crossing of a river covered with ice and water for most notes people such an adventure would
 be the source of rather boastful talk for father louis is was sim 1 for their reminiscences about father louis

 negligence in the land titles office by john w chalmers tourists approaching edmonton from the south might be startled to
 see on the outskirts of the city between the wide apart north and south lanes of the highway the derrick
 of an oil well but no tool pusher is shouting orders to a crew of roughnecks no machinery is noisily
 turning a drilling bit chewing its way through rock and shale hundreds of feet below ground level today this derrick
 once part of a working rig is what a memento a keepsake a symbol a publicity device all of the
 above indeed that skeletal tower now in its third location in the little gateway park that is basically a tourist
 information centre was the derrick for imperial leduc no 1 the discovery well that led to alberta s second and
 great oil boom since the province s oil generated prosperity has now lasted with a few down turn periods for
 more than four decades it is not surprising that the derrick has become a sort of secular icon symbolic of
 the gas and oil wealth that precipitated j alberta into the twentieth century on its second site a kilometer or
 so north of gateway park it leduc no one also served as a slgnpost carrying the dubious claim edmonton oil
 capital of canada settled by the supreme court of canada in 1954 icons tend to give rise to myths nor
 is this not by the privy council derrick or rather the discovery well it represents an edmonton journal story of
 november 2 different in this respect allan anderson reports 1965 reporting the death of anthony anton that according to walt
 dingle turta similarly confused two parcels of land that the well was drilled on mike tur ta s land and
 on which the discovery well was drilled and that the mineral rights were owned by the canadian where a later
 well was spudded in a mile west and pacific railway but their mineral nghts only entitled them to oil and
 there was no reference a little south of the discovery well to natural gas so there was a legal suit
 after when did the concept of land ownership become wards hat while the cpr was entitled to the oil a
 legal reality in what is now alberta surely not they wer en t entitled to the gas i believe this
 before the white man arrived the indians had no was one of the la t cases taken before the brit
 concept of private ownership of and exclusive tiish pnvy council the account is correct except that the well dr chalmers
 of edmonton a well known author wasn t on mike turta s fann while the cpr origi and educator is
 a past pr esident of the historical nally owned all mineral rights they lost all in society of alberta he

 these bodies were similar to of the quarter section to andrew sitko and the hose of the four first provinces

 gallagher who escaped from he edmonton barracks recently were recaptured by sergt gordon and a policeman at the lone pine
 on the edmonton trail last saturday the police and their prisoners stopped at barnett s on saturday night but the
 prisoners on sunday morning again effected their escape by a strategy of the most daring character after breakfast crackerbox only
 one of whose hands was pinioned ca lled the policeman barnett and miller the driver of a wagon in which
 the prisoners were being conveyed up to a table to show them a trick with a pack of cards they
 all stepped close up when crackerbox adroitly drew a revolver from one of the policeman s boots nd levelliiig it
 at the sergeant ordered hands up sergt gordon hesitated to obey the command and crackerbox fired twice the sergeant and
 the others then threw up their hands and the prisoners were masters of the situation crackerbox then cooly disarmed the
 party order ed barnett and miller to handcuff the policeman and when that was securely done he left gallagher in
 charge of the whole party and went out to saddle the police hor ses this done gallapher and crackerbox mounted

 found of the daring fugitives it will go hard with them if they are caught but the chances are in

 1886 1905 by henry c klassen the private banking business of the late nineteenth century was often the product of
 family enterprise in october 1886 two brothers ‘ nathaniel hamngton cowdry and john cowdry opened a private bank at fort
 macleod within a year the capital resources of the new concern were estimated at between 10 000 and 20 000
 after remaining at this level from 1887 to 1890 they increased gradually to between 50 000 and 75 000 by
 1900 and then topped 100 000 by 1905 the history of cowdry brothers is interesting because it shows how a
 small scale private banking house became an important force in early southwestern alberta finance although it was a modest affair
 by chartered banking standards the business was one of the largest ventures of its kind in the region the relatively
 slow growth of the chartered banks in the fort macleod area helps to explain why the cowdrys were able to
 sustain their own growth for nearly two decades their undertaking while owing its life to the new small town and
 agrarian society created by settlement john cowdry made a pioneering contribution to economic development bank at toronto in 1866 leaving
 it towards the the character and evolution of cowdry brothers end of that decade to join the toronto branch of

 local and regional surroundings in and then in senior positions until 1882 john was which it operated and the financial
 world to which born in 1857 at toronto and like his older brother it belonged nathaniel and john cowdry who
 before him attended upper canada college john created owned and ran the bank had considera began his business career as
 a clerk at the toronto ble banking experience and a claim to no ordi branch of the merchants bank of
 canada and by nary lineage their father thomas cowdry was a physician and surgeon who had his medical dr klassen
 is associate professor of hisiory university of calgary he is the author of numerous practice in toronto from at least
 the 1 860 s to the papers on southern alberta the most r ecent being early 1880 s nathaniel was

 in this office responsible bankers who derived their strength in both nathaniel and john cowdry had the qual large part
 from their superior conservative manageities of an astute businessman they were prudent ment certainly the partnership was well and enterprising
 bankers and men of thrift their received 4 upbringing and schooling besides encour aging over the years the improvements in

 of 1886 was enlarged in 1892 and pool capital and the interior was remodelled in 1897 five before the cowdrys
 opened for business at fort years later in 1902 the bank moved into its new macleod they spent four years
 farming on a brick building on main street with an office on homestead and on other land they acquired near
 the second floor which was leased to the lega l firm regina 2 the savings they accumulated first as harris

 pug nose a freckled face and a tangled mass of hair stood on the beautiful gr een gr ass plot
 in the mar of the immigr ant building a few days ago exhibiting a wanton brutality that was positively shocking
 he was barefooted and hatless but his trousers made up in a measur e for these deficiencies by having a
 wonderful breadth of beam this garment was held up with the assistance of frequent sailor like hitchings and a piece
 of cord that ran diagonally across his body the cord served a double purpose for it also kept in place
 a hickory jumper that was much too small for him it was high noon what little wind there was came
 from the south and was shut off by the high building so hat the vertical rays of the sun reached
 the ground without interference in front of this boy were a dozen little fellows who at his bidding began working
 like little slaves they evidently were all unmindful of the heat they ran violently to and fro sometimes describing a
 circle and occasionally going only a short distance when pug nose either because some feeling of pity moved him or
 through spite would order hem to come back it was difficult to discern the object of all this violent labor
 one minute a poor little fellow would exert himself to the utmost in throwing a sphere to another boy about
 thirty feet away but before this boy could catch it another boy would strike it savagely with a club and
 then dash madly away when this occurred a number of other boys with yells of frantic rage or terror would
 dash after this sphere when it was captured it would be thrown with deadly aim at the poor boy this
 boy if he caught it in order to protect himself would in n evident spirit of revenge punch the boy
 who had caused the trouble by knocking it away every time the hardworking little fellows ceased their violent exertions the
 pug nosed boy in the rear would start them to work again by some pre emptory order it was observed
 that his sphere was sometimes called a muff nd sometimes lettergo at one o clock a shrill whistle came up
 from he round house and as though this was he signal for their release he little fellows darted away and
 disappeared in the various stor es lining south railway street their pug nosed master thrust the sphere into his pocket
 and slouched away in search evidently of other victims medicine hat times july 6 1889 deacon white sportsman by patrick
