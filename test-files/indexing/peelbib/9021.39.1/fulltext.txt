 the fate of the sharphead stoneys brian titley in 1876 the canadian government negotiated treaties reserves of one square mile
 per family treaty no six with the indians occupying a vast of five gratuities annuities schools and the expanse of
 territory stretching hrough what is now material wherewithal to engage in agriculture in central alberta and saskatchewan among those addition
 ottawa promised supplies of medicine who signed an adher ence to the treaty was a band and appropriate assistance to
 prevent starvation of stoneys under their chief sharphead or che in return for these and other concessions the pos ta
 quan who initially settled at pigeon lake indians surrendered their claim to the lands that also included were four bands
 of plains cree they and their ancestors had hunted and foraged under their chiefs bobtail ermineskin samson on for centuries
 and agreed to settle on their and muddy bull who chose to settle nearby along reserves the battle river where

 of the chase proximity to the indians in question 2 thus for the tedium of agriculture and animal husbandry began
 the task of attaching these hunters to the was taken with reluctance by a people whose soil entir e cultural
 and r eligious outlook was intimately not much could be accomplished that first bound up with the hunting way of
 life it was not winter misery was the prevalent condition on the simply a question of exchanging one form of

 that she was in control few indians had decisions the virtual disappearance of the buffalo adequate apparel to combat the
 intense cold and during that period meant that the old pattern of the hardier spirits who ventured forth on the
 trail living was doomed while hunting would continue of prey found little to reward their efforts it was to be
 an important source of sustenance for those not just the absence of buffalo but of most forms indians most realized
 that they would also need of animal life that brought whispers of despair the skills of the white man to
 survive it was for fish too were scarce the indians ate most of this reason that they accepted the cattle
 and their dogs and many of their horses just to survive agricultural implements offered in the treaty there was some
 assistance from the government in 1879 when hese reserves were being selected but that body did not have the resources
 at hand ottawa s indian branch it became a department to prevent destitution the supply farms were not in the
 following year embarked on a program to yet productive units 3 avert mass starvation in the north west at the
 sharphead and his followers had chosen their initiative of commissioner edgar dewdney it was reserve for the fine fishing that
 pigeon lake decided to appoint seventeen farm instructors in offered but the surrounding countryside was the region their immediate task
 was to raise thickly wooded and unfit for farming and they enough food to supply the indians and in the
 long found the adjustment to settled life difficult term to introduce the hunters of the plains to the moreover they
 were some distance from instrucwonders of tillage and herding this they were tor lucas s supply farm and often had
 to fend for to accomplish from the redoubts of supply or themselves when agency inspector t p wadshome farms located
 adjacent to clusters of worth visited them in 1979 he found them poorly reserves indians would be employed on these
 clothed and ill equipped to cope with their new farms thereby acquiring practical experience in way of life agriculture the
 home farms would also provide during the winter of 1880 8 1 the band was the indians with seed enabling
 them to experiment starving and in desperation raided the roothouse with their new skills on the reserves the ultimate of
 the mckernan family at hay lakes helping goal of the policy was the transformation of the themselves to potatoes complaints

 and clothing were proving to be almost as good idea since the reserve had excellent agricultural potential unlike morley the
 band numbered 164 at this time 5 the stoneys at morley had some time been under the tutelage of the
 mcdougall family the leading methodist missionaries on the prairies sharphead s stoneys wer e also claimed by the methodists indeed
 missionary activity had begun among them during their sojourn at pigeon lake once settled at wolf creek they received a
 permanent preacher the rev john nelson who opened a school on the reserve in 1883 an inflexible and difficult man
 nelson would later have a brief and tempestuous career as the first principal of the ill fated red deer indian
 industrial school the indian department generally welcomed the presence of missionaries on reserves indeed it paid the salaries of school
 teachers who instructed the native youth mission schools after all were believed to have a civilizing effect on the young
 and this was in accordance with the state s goals crown and mitre hen were partners in this grand enterprise
 to promote christianity the english language individualism he work ethic and other tr appings of anglo canadian culture among the
 indian population in 1883 the department began to reconsider its original arrangement whereby its instructors were samuel b lucas was
 the indian agent who had respon located on supply farms next to reserves some sibility for the sharphead stoneys during
 their difficult years of these men were working their holdings for their own personal advantage giving sca nt consider ation
 elusive overfishing in local lakes at spawning to their instructional duties and even in the case season was destroying the
 hitherto abundant of reliable instructors such as lucas there were whitefish far too many indians spread over a wide area
 for in 1883 the department of indian affairs per adequate supervision it was decided therefore suaded the stoneys to relocate
 to new reserve at to subdivide agencies to hire more farm instruc wolf creek where it entered the battle river
 tors and to place them directly on reserves the here the land was more suited to farming and they hope
 was expressed that these would be married made their first attempts at breaking the soil men whose wives would reside
 with them the when inspector wadsworth visited them in august wives would prove useful in imparting domestic 1884 he found
 that they had fifteen acres in crop skills to their native counterparts 6 divided evenly between potatoes and barley they
 this administrative innovation worked to luhad started to build houses but had stopped when cas s advantage the wolf creek

 agency to move when death occurred so they all left the known as peace hills and he was elevated to
 the reserve and did not return until the treaty payments position of agent this change took place in in september
 a few stoneys from morley had december 1884 the agency headquarters was joined them at wolf creek and others wished
 to located on samson s reserve and the agricultural come along as well wadsworth thought this a activities of this
 band became lucas s dir ect responsibility farm instructors reporting to him of any in this agency were placed on
 the other reserves the old supply the sedentary existence required a fixed abode farm was purchased by the new agent

 during these years was the construction of log these changes had no sooner taken place than houses for themselves cutting
 and hauling logs the agency was almost engulfed by the north was hard labour but it could be accomplished with
 west rebellion in fact an omen of the trouble the axes and other simple tools that were availasome times appear

 bands of big bear and little pine tasks that usually required the supervisory assisarrived at peace hills and made preparations

 boards for roofs and floors these settling influence they wintered at buffalo lake commodities were not readily at hand and
 had to a nd maintained communcation between battleford be purchased with the profits of hunting fishing and peace hills towards
 the end of february or farming because such activities were rarely 1885 more messengers arrived from the battleford profitable few
 indians could build decent houses indians with the news that big bear would come the majority had to be content
 with rather primiand take over the reserves this stirred the restless tive cabins which they only used for part of
 the spirits whose resentment at the tedium of reserve year they continued to spend most of their time life had

 by the department family to the comparative safety of edmonton and with the materials needed to construct comfortable he was
 joined there by his farm instructors and dwellings in this way their loyalty to the state the reverend nelson was
 reinforced and a good example was set for lucas evidently expected the worst now that others 0 his restraining hand
 was lifted the indians would success at agriculture continued to elude sharpplunge into an orgy of destructive self indulgence head
 and his followers they added a few acres and the cherished progress of recent years would to the land under
 cultivation as the seasons passed be dissipated but it was not so the call to arms but often with discouraging
 results met a mixed reception sharphead s stoneys what could they do in such circumstances eschewed it completely and fled
 to the woods to there was always hunting an avocation they conavoid even the tincture of involvement the bear tinued
 to practise and was permitted by treaty hills chiefs muddy bull samson and ermineskin ever y autumn when agricultural operations

 hunting was a popular activity general tb strange arrived and left a small gar it was not always encouraged by
 the department rison in the vicinty 8 however since it tended to interfere with farm lucas had great difficulty persuading
 the work game became scarce during these years stoneys to return to wolf creek and put in a crop perhaps
 as a result of overhunting forcing the they refused to break new land and spent the indians to turn increasingly
 to fishing as a means summer and autumn building houses and putting of sustenance the bounty of the deep was

 reserve for the regular rations were always reduced when but refused to supplement their regular rations crops game or fish
 were at hand 2 and those they asked for fresh beef but were denied who refused to work were instantly
 cut off this moreover lucas forbade the use of indian docsystem was humiliating to the indians they tors claiming that
 they charged exorbitant rates remembered the flowery utterances of friendship and resorted to worthless superstitious practices and promises of assistance
 made in the previous the local methodist missionary john nelson decade by the treaty commissioners what they ironically supported the
 use of medicine men had received instead was a not so subtle manipu saying that their knowledge was useful and
 that lation of their lives to compound matters the they charged no more than regular medical spectre of hunger if
 not starvation still haunted practitioners them they often found the bacon unpalatable and while the debate raged he first of
 many deaths their requests for fresh beef were invariably occurred in spite of lucas s exortations to the denied and
 should desperation prompt them to contrary the stoneys left their reserve at the end slaughter one of their cattle without

 retained on a source of such exchange a poor return from the part time basis by the department to serve

 dead of cold and hunger are debilitating enemies and winter normal practice was to treat them on their open the
 door to disease and death these indians reserves moreover he claimed that he had had were already susceptible to the
 ravages of mala more trouble with sharphead s stoneys than with dies introduced by whites such as measles in any
 other band the reverend nelson was partly fiuenza and tuberculosis and their living condi to blame for this he alleged
 since the missionary tions in the decade following settlement further was unwilling to restrict the activities of indian weakened their
 ability to resist these ills sharp doctors and readily promoted the use of certain head s stoneys were the least
 resilient of all and patent medicines such as kennedy s medical succumbed to the cold embrace of death at an
 discovery which likely caused more harm than alarming rate good yet when wadsworth visited them in june 1886 lucas prevailed
 upon the band to return to wolf he claimed they had just returned from a success creek and there dr
 mclnnes attended to them ful hunt and he described them as sleek and fat administering doses of cough medicine and
 cod and well clot hed they had 37 acres under crop liver oil the agent still denied them permission to
 kill cattle and death continued to stalk them another doctor h c wilson visited the reserve in february 1887 distributing
 medicine he found that many indians were suffering from pneumonia as a result of exposure their housing food and clothing
 were grossly inadequate and their physical condition was weakened by the measles epidemic by the end of march 1887 lucas
 described their condition as miser able but claimed that it was difficult to help them since they often refused to
 take their medicine and exposed themselves needlessly to cold and wet as he described it they seemed to have given
 off all hope and declare their belief that they are doomed and ascribe their aftlictions to every other cause than
 the real one that is leaving the reserve last fall before they had recovered from all measles against my advice
 and wish 4 in october 1886 a total of 187 stoneys had been paid by september 1887 72 of them
 or more than a third of the band had died of these 47 were boys and girls under the age
 of fifteen years inspector wadsworth in reporting these horrifying figures expressed the belief that their illness had not been properly
 diagnosed nor proper remedies applied unless extraordinary measures were taken he predicted further deaths would occur after he visited the
 pupils in rev nelson s school he reported i have visited all parts of this country and all the indians
 in it during the past nine years but for pure destitution i never saw such a picture as these fourteen
 children presented two little fellows were more conspicuous than the others from the fact that they had not a stitch
 upon them btit their mgged shirts and the day was so inclement that i wore a fur coat myself with
 great comfort lucas cannot be held entirely responsible for the stoneys misfortune he was after all carr ying out the
 draconian policy of a distant and often indifferent bureaucracy which demanded accountability for every penny spent a decision to incr
 ease r ations kill an ox or call in a doctor was immediately questioned by the indian commissioner s office
 as a possible extr avagance indeed it is remarkable that in spite of the harsh measur es which policy often
 required him to take lucas appears to have maintained the goodwill sharphead s stoneys never fully recovered from eyes on
 the wolf creek lands and this appar ently the disastrous winter of 1886 87 sickness con also influenced the department

 robert rundle was not a teacher he was part of a small community of farmers and fishermen near falmouth bay
 cornwall his father was firmly established in the parish church of engla nd his mother was zealously methodist surrounded by
 her father and brother who were well known and popular preachers it probably says something of robert s charecter that
 he could not decide until he was 21 years old which route he would follow and had no sense of
 direction as to occupation for some years after that having decided to be a methodist he took advantage of a
 training school sponsored by the methodists with the intention of becoming a business clerk then he became interested in broader
 concerns there was a serious rift within the church that excited him lord john russell s reform bill had excited
 him earlier but in the business college he lost most of his radical blood and reckoned that he would be
 transformed into a tory before long that could well have resulted in a ver y ordinary life a small but
 regular pay packet family home and community and we can only be amazed at the sudden change of events he
 reports briefly on a change of motivation blessed god soul reform reached me and with that he moved from the
 business college to a school of theological study he had been there only a few months when word reached him
 of the invitation of the wesleyan missionar y society and hudson s bay company to volunteer for an appointment in
 the wilds of british north america so that friendly and wellmeaning young man that timid and indecisive young man that
 untrained and unprepared young man said i will go how can one account for such an unexpected and far reaching
 resolve to embark on such a venture and how can one account for the eight somewhat undistinguished years r esulting
 in his name held up to the world on mount rundle he knew that he would be cared for at
 the corn robert terrill rundle pany fort and that transportation and interpreters would be provided to some extent but in
 all other respects he was venturing into a scene he knew nothing about a climate he had never experienced a
 life style he could never have imagined communities of people living in a strange culture and languages entirely unknown to
 him what had he rev hutchinson presented this paper to the 1990 annual meeting of the historical society of alberta

 religious motivation and proved to be a life saver foi him the rev james often critical of the results of
 such labours but evans was a late addition to the proposed mis there are some striking features in rundle s
 sion he had years of experience with the ojib behaviour which provide the clues to his success ways in upper
 canada and was expected to pro as a teacher or perhaps more accurately as an vide the experience the young
 men lacked but exemplar a confusion in travel plans upset the whole first there was complete integrity within himscheme evans
 missed the company s spring self a certainty of his own identity and purpose brigade from montreal so the three
 young english even after eight years of living without support men went on without him expecting to meet him or
 reinforcement from his peers he never became en route rundle arrived at norway house early a company man but retained
 his independence in june and decided to wait there for evans not to the last knowing when to expect him
 second he had an unbelievable capacity for norway house was the one place in the tern going into the unknown
 with confidence for emtories prepared for a new missionary and it became barking on gruelling and high risk travel for
 going his introduction and training school chief factor unprotected amongst people regarded by others donald ross had wanted a resident
 missionary for as dangerous and for simply staying with his some years he knew the indians very well and purpose
 was on good terms with them so he became run and third he demonstr ated a willingness to die s
 sponsor and counsellor the indian commu learn from others and to entrust the leadership to nities were friendly and ready
 competent inter others even as he was preaching and teaching preters were taken for granted amongst them again we must
 ask what had he to teach or one may perceive in these principles rundle s to offer he had no
 curriculum or plan of action own sense of inadequacy he was not a master he had no inkling of the
 problems that would of anything he had no agenda to push his superburden later missionaries of having to prepare the
 intendent james evans visited only once in his indians for white settlement and takeover he was first year and thereafter
 rundle was entirely on simply there to meet the indian people in their own his own countr y and identify
 himself with their needs this chief factor john rowand wrote of rundle in venture would make no sense at all
 had it not been 1841 in my opinion the man is too young for for the urgent sense of soul
 reform as he called them i believe him to be a very good man but it he seems to have
 had a clear and straight those tribes expect to see something superior forward understanding that god had reached into governor
 george simpson wrote in same year his life for good and that he must share the gift mr rundle would
 do much more good by particularly with those most in need the british remaining at one or the other of
 the establishpublic had been aroused to the pitiable state of ments than in wandering around the country in the indian
 people in upper canada where they search of indians in their camps mr rundle had been displaced and dispossessed of
 their lands possesses more zeal than judgment he lacks by white settlers and in the hbc territory where expenence is
 not quite so grave and senous in his manner as would be desirable is too much the intensive hunting for
 fur had depnved the given to fnvolous chitchat and gossip with our indians of their food sources there were outbursts
 clerks and others and is rather indiscreet in the of criticismagainst the company and sympathy expression of his opinion on
 matters on which for the indians from his inexperience he must be perfectly in presumably it was this sense of
 need which competent to form an opinion caught he attention of rundle who had so recently been awakened and motivated
 by his experience james evans commented in 1841 that mr of soul reform when he landed in new york he
 rundle is an englishman and must become a commented on the indians these unhappy and hudson s bay man he
 is very zealous and doubtdeeply injured beings he had something to less sincere but perhaps lacks either judgment or rundle
 had his greatest success labouring among the woods cree and stoneys above is a view of a stoney camp painted
 b paul kane at rocky mountain house in 1848 prudence or both lt john lefroy head of the but then
 he was invited to visit the great black toronto conservatory recorded his impressions foot camp so he took his triumphal
 tour to them in his autobiography i found mr rundle a good with jimmie jock as his interpreter there he
 little man ver y young and inexperienced and of began having trouble with the interpreter who had no obvious fitness
 for his calling and ver y his own full quota of confidence and self imporignorant tance rundle would preach a
 sentence in english this unflattering litany hardly seems a basis for which jimmie jock would translate and then keep greatness
 it must be recognized however that right on preaching on his own rundle of course these statements all come from
 older men each had no idea what was being said and rebuked his of them a power figure in the
 white culture servant for his presumption finally when the rundle never did rank very highly with them but great assembly
 of blackfoot were readied for the claims of his greatness are based in the rundle s preaching jimmie jock refused
 to come responses of the native people moreover granting into the tent he would not be threatened or all of
 these inadequacies he had some remarkable cajoled into saying a woiil rundle was humiliated strengths and qualities that would be
 deemed in the presence of people who had thought of him admir able under anyone s judgment as some kind
 of god man it took some time to from the present perspective one can only con recover a working trust
 with jimmie jock but to dude that his shortcomings served him well since his credit he did so never again
 however did they protected him from pride and presumption he mount so high a hor se his one period of
 mastery and of being overlord having presented so unpromising a prospect in was ended abruptly by the intransigence of his
 rundle let me now report on the positive achieveinterpreter the famed jimmie jock bird the ments of this remarkable man
 three month stay at norway house had been so first was his insight in learning to go to the encouraging
 and successful that his confidence in indians his preaching mission soared he wrote in his on his first sunday preaching
 at norway house diar y that upon entering the saskatchewan district he was greatly inspired by the response of the
 the text impressed on his mind was rise shine many indians present then he wrote i for your light has
 come and his first great promised at the close to meet them at their own easter weekend at rocky mountain
 house with village at which they were delighted i expect the rousing response from crees and assinboines nearly every grown
 up person in the village was confirmed his sense of master y present their attention this evening exceeded that of
 the afternoon the fort was white man s tern jock did become the interpreter and remained a tor y in
 which the indian was a well behaved guest close acquaintance through all of rundle s years the village was indian
 territory in which the but rundle s la nguage pr oblem was resolved quite indians themselves were in charge and
 the white differently through cree syllabics preacher placed himself and his pr eaching under evans explained the syllabic system to
 rundle their judgment and leadership by letter but he had difficulty in understanding it this became his cardinal principle strongly
 in november 1841 evans spent three weeks at enough established to withstand the advice and fort edmonton teaching rundle the
 system and instructions of governor simpson and others working with chief trader j e harnott on a simpson criticized rundle
 for roaming around the series of translations harriott could translate country instead of staying in the forts the gover freely
 between cree and english while neither nor met with rundle and discussed the question evans nor rundle could understand cree
 but in a letter of september 1841 rundle approached when harnott provided the cree sounds they the governor again could
 expr ess those sounds in the syllabic forms i understood from you that i was at liberty to and the
 native people could read their own ianvisit the indians at their camps when they were guage from those forms when
 harriott translated located at any place and likely to remain for any the 23 rd psalm into cree evans and
 later runlength of time this permission however is not dle without understanding the cree sounds could granted in the memoranda
 i believe that method express them in the syllabic form and the native would prove most effective amongst the indians
 person for the first time could read the 23 rd psalm as their stay is generally so limited at the
 forts in his own tongue this principle became an issue again when the the effects were astonishing with harriott s
 governor sent out instructions to establish a school translations of hymns prayers and selected texts for indian boys to be
 located in fort edmonton rundle learned to write out by hand what he called rundle was not in a position
 to deny such a the sunday books an interested indian could take development but neither he nor the edmonton the
 book to his own camp and could read it out people wanted it he believed that such a school to
 everyone so the message rundle longed to should be located in some of the indian encamp teach was now entrusted
 to the encampment and ments the issue was never settled and the school they developed their own leaders the new
 techwas not established in the fort meanwhile rundle nology almost entirely replaced the need of intercontinued to visit extensively in
 he encampments preters but more importantly they developed the second was rundle s use of native syllabic christian community amongst
 themselves it was language enriched when rundle was able to visit but it he entered the country with only english
 on really became a self reliant native church because his tongue though he seemed to have some they had the
 means of education in their own familiarity with french the company had a hands within a few years the printing
 press at variety of interpreters available but the transla the rossville mission near norway house was tion of methodist sermons
 was rather out of their supplying additional printed material in syllabics line evans had earlier explained his distress and but
 rundle became the first teacher and provider need to the missionary society the interpreters of the good news available to
 native people in in the company he said were all canadians by a familiar form which he meant french and
 catholic and of third was rundle s ability to identify his mescourse wicked men and the pure waters of sage
 with the spiritual concerns already known to methodism would be muddied running through them such a channel rundle too was
 desperate he he had little or no knowledge of what we would decided he should go south to get help
 from the call native religion let alone approving of it but american methodists but abandoned the plan he by going
 to them he learned their responses recognized the language abilities of jimmie jock chief john snow in his book hese
 mountains and this set off a flurry of concerned correspon are our sacred places tells of the deeply retidence between
 rowand and simpson jimmie gious nature of the stoneys and their belief in the and the company increased to the
 point where no further expansion of mission activity was possible when evans died in 1846 the company relaxed its rules
 and allowd benjamin sinclair to join rundle in founding a new mission as it turned out rundle barely got it
 started before he had to return to england to recover from a broken arm the mission continued under native leadership
 for seven years before a new missionary arrived this native leader ship represented the results of rundle s influence when
 rundle was at norway house for thr ee months in 1840 benjamin sinclair had been one of the first natives
 to respond ben and margaret were married by rundle before he left for fort edmonton ben continued in the mission
 became a class leader and prepared for work as an assistant so his appointment to join rundle was a reunion
 with his first teacher and motivator sinclair later joined forces with henry steinhauer at lac la biche and then whitefish
 lake until both men died on the same weekend in 1884 rundle had successfully shared his motivation two other major
 native leaders were james and john sons of wetaskimakan rundle had married the two couples near saddle lake in 1842
 and they had followed him closely john became the leader of the christian encampment on the bow river until ‘
 he and his family were killed james with his family worked with ben at pigeon lake and was an influence
 for many years the pigeon lake settlement became well known as described by peter erasmus and evidenced by the special
 visits by dr james hector of the palliser expedition and by j b tyrrell it never became an agricultural centre
 but was the gathering centre for the christians of the stoney people from eden valley morley kootenay plains rocky mountain
 house and buck lake the enduring effects of rundle s ministry are seen directly in people rather than in places
 for pigeon lake was the only site he founded the converts under his influence were influential for a long time
 the seenum family of goodfish lake the little hunter camp of saddle lake chief maskepetoon of the gull lake area
 the samson band now at hobbema were all initiated and taught by rundle even the blackfoot who had been disappointed
 by his first visits continued to keep in touch members pulled a turnip from the gaiden he made in 1846
 rundle had said farewell to everyone his mark on a tally boani on a tree they also had for at
 least a year for a furlough in england but all the qualities needed for dependable guides at fort carlton he
 learned that his superintendent local knowledge and skills friendliness and underhad been recalled so he had to turn back to
 standing with the white man and the willingness edmonton again he then hurried to rocky moun to venture hence the
 palliser names of abraham tam house since he feared that a priest might have and nimrod the correspondence between dr
 moved in to claim the flock while he was away hector and rundle successor the rev thomas as the word
 spread that rundle was back many woolsey provide abundant evidence of their gat hered to shake hands again including upwards
 respect for the influence of rundle the name of 200 blackfoot they had other interests at the mount rundle appeared
 on palliser map and fort but the warmth of their welcome was very there seems no doubt that hector or
 palliser or gratifying both named the mountain in tribute the next year 1847 maskepetoon organized the mcdougalls both george and
 john refer and directed an amazing venture he took rundle often to the patriarchs of the church enlisted by on
 a guided tour through encampment after en rundle sometimes they were embarrassed at old campment south to the bow river
 and up the bow stephen who observed the sabbath more faithfully to lake minnewanka across the bow to the high
 than they did as stephen said that is what they wood river and south of the highwood for three were
 taught george mcdougall marvelled at the weeks travel probably including the peigans and vitality of the church of stoney christians
 who bloods gathered 300 strong at pigeon lake he wrote to the palliser expedition met the christian camps the mission
 authorities if rundle had not taught of stoneys ten years after rundle s departure and the syllabics they would have
 relapsed into were astonished at what they could see a wor paganism shipping community with all of their traditional perhaps
 he was a teacher after all skills and gardens as well when one of the band calgary s climate the
 mildness of our winters is a constant source of wonder to visitors they pass through winnipeg brandon regina and other
 points east and see the temperature down to 10 20 or 30 below zero and on reaching calgary find the
 air balmy the sun shining brightly and the ground free from snow it may surprise easterners to hear that during
 january the dust was quite troublesome at times but such is nevertheless the fact lately the trouble has been water
 several days and even nights steady thawing have caused numerous pools and streams and the city public works department has
 had men busy with pick and shovel this week letting the water off the streets the dominion government meterological returns
 for januar y for three important climatic points are given below and they speak fur themselves they show beyond doubt
 that as far as winter climate is concerned calgar y is all right the highest and lowest temperatures fur the
 month were calgary 51 above and 12 below medicine hat 44 above and 22 below edmonton 45 above and 26
 below the mean temperature and snowfall for january were calgary 20 above and no snow edmonton 12 above and 1
 0 inches of snow and medicine hat 20 above and 0 2 inches of snow any impression that calgary has
 an arid climate ought to be dispelled by the fact as shown by the government observations that while the average
 precipitation is somewhere about 12 inches the fall of moisture during 1902 was a fraction over 34 inches or more
 than twice the average of manitoba for the last three years the local complaint has been not too little but
 too much rain the amusing feature of it all is that you can t get an eastern man much less
 a winnipegger who hasn t been here to believe the facts about the climate if you tell them that people
 about in the middle of winter without overcoats that office windows and shop doors are kept wide open and that
 men work outside in their shirtsleeves in january they set you down for a cheerful liar until they come and
 see for themselves or read the government figures calgary herald february 26 1903 reminiscences ofa hospital sergeant edward a braithwaite
 in 1941 calgar y physician george r johnson convinced dr braithwaite to write his reminiscences about his experiences in the
 north west mounted police as braithwaite explains he never kept a diar y and at the age of eighty he
 had to rely on his memory this is the best i can do he said when he submitted his reminiscences
 to johnson so don t blame me if it is all rot edward ainslie braithwaite was born in alne yorkshire
 in 1862 and moved to the channel islands when he was seven after attending school in jersey somersetshire and devonshir
 e he was admitted to king s college hospital london where he studied medicine under joseph lister after his services
 with the mounted police he began a medical practise in edmonton in 1892 and was appointed coroner for the district
 in 1895 he later became chief coroner for alberta and medical inspector of alberta hospitals he died in edmonton in
 1949 dr braithwaite s reminiscences were given to the glenbow archives calgary with the johnson papers the account has been
 edited to remove extensive ramblings and extraneous material the full manuscript may be seen at glenbow hugh a dempsey editor

 courier each stating that there and nearly shot you i answered that i thought were two thousand people in prince

 wounded on the steamer we rested one day and then left for fort in the fighting at batoche i got

 just in time culty one of the constables had been wounded for the last half hour of the fighting upon
 request i superintended the placing of a ll wounded men on the steamer to go to the base hospital where
 saskatoon is now situated i then returned to prince albert while at batoche i saw thr ee men cr ossing
 the militar y encampment on being challenged two of them replied that the had taken riel s cook as a
 prisoner some years later in the course of my 1 jt ‘ duties as medical inspector of hospita ls i
 was at gleichen the superintendent told me that armstrong he man who claimed to have captured ‘ ‘ riel was
 there i said we ll have some fun i ‘ then armstrong was pointed out to me and i ‘
 said your name is armstrong ‘‘ yes sir he replied i they tell me you captured rail i yes sir
 i said you know that is a damned lie ‘ he was an old man and started to protest i
 added you know very well it was riel s cook ‘ you and peter houri captured i he jumped out
 of the chairand exclaimed by l ‘ god you were there i told him i was and at once we
 became pals an artist from the illustrated london times made this sketch of peter houri and cst armstrong bringing louis
 if they had said it really was rail when they were rita into camp as a prisoner in 1885 bnnging
 him in i have no doubt murder would have been done that is why they said it was his night
 we had left nineteen men in barracks and cook came back to find five hundred recruits there was to return
 to the story i do not exactly remem a lot of what i called unfair fighting going on ber what
 happened at carlton but the military among them so i took it upon myself to go into went here while
 i returned to prince albert from the largest barrack room there i was ordered back to regina three teams look
 here you fellows i said the next were sent out but at touchwood one of our horses man that comes
 up to the hospital for unfair went lame the two other drivers both married fighting goes to the guard room
 went on while sergeant jim davis and i being a few days later an old soldier named armbachelors stayed behind
 at qu appelle we got strong came up with his eyes nearly gouged out a hor se which was slightly
 lame and as we wanted i asked who did that to make regina the next night we drove on about
 i don t know sir twelve miles and camped i was awakened early who were you fighting with same answer
 in the morning by jim who shook me by the i turned to the hospital orderly take him to shoulder
 the guard room doe keep quiet get one of the horses and oh please don t he replied it was
 a man hurry called purvis we hitched up and started off and found we i at once went up to
 the sergeant major and wer e being followed by a lot of indians who were reported the case as his
 answer was not very camped off their reserve and were on the warpath polite i walked over to the adjutant
 s office just a little later one of our corporals and two men as i got there the sergeant major
 ran up to me sent them back to their r eserve for which action asking if i wanted to get
 him broke and begged some military regiment got the credit me to leave the matter to him and he would
 attend well finally we got back to regina late at to it to complete the story which i am very
 fond of three years later i came from lethbridge to provost sergeant said to me as we left him do
 regina to go to wood mountain on arrival a man not look around now but when you get a few
 cells crossed the square and came up to me and asked farther up turn around quickly and look at big
 what time i wanted to leave i replied that i had bear i did so and if i ever saw
 a malevolent no orders he said i m head teamster for b look it was there division and was told
 to get my orders from to talk to riel in his cell he was a nice man you with a
 good education so far as i could judge well i said let s have breakfast and then he believed the
 half breeds had not been treated pull right out right and he thought he was fighting in a just you
 don t remember me he said my name cause riel told me the only time he ever took is purvis
 a rifle in his hand was the day he heard the i did not remember him but he informed me
 mounted police had left prince albert as far as that i got him three months in gaol i immediately i
 know the rebellion was due to the half breeds thought well this is fine i have to travel 120 belief
 that they were fighting for their just rights miles with you with a four horse tea m we started the
 indians had got their treaty rights whilst the out the rule on a trip was that you had to help
 half breeds had been absolutely ignor ed no matter what your rank i tried to unharness the now as to
 the hanging of riel i believe the horse tried to help in greasing a wheel tried to feeling generally was
 that it was most unfortunate get a pail of water but i was not allowed to do but had to
 be done in the cause of justice he had a thing just before we pulled into wood moun been brought
 from montana i believe against his tam he said that fight i had was fair the way will but thought
 he was doing his duty to his i was brought up i m a lumberman from new fellow men i
 have no right to question the justice brunswick i ve nothing against you you said you of the act but
 i believe i am right in saying that were going to do it and you did the general opinion was
 that the death penalty was another little episode occurred in regina in too severe for a man who had not
 earned arms 1885 the montreal garrison artillery were there were others who escaped and who deserved camped across the barracks
 and some of our ser it far more incidentally i was present at the geants kept on asking their sergeants
 to come over execution of rid and have dinner with us without informing our about june 1885 i was ordered
 to maple creek mess three of our men who had just been to take the place of dr haultain who
 had gone promoted as sergeants came to me as senior of off on his honeymoon i was there for three
 the mess and complained that if this kept up they months and then returned to regina when i got could
 not pay their mess dues i then met with ready to go to lethbridge with what was called the offenders
 and told them that it was not fair the flying patrol k division we had to transto keep on asking
 these men in i had quite a fer at dunmore seven miles from medicine hat wr angle about it especially
 from one mn he was on to a narrow gauge railway where they had the rough riding corporal who had
 once called me benches rigged up in box cars down for dismounting we were never friends finally we arrived in
 lethbridge and went into finally i said i would send the orderly for the quarters under canvas in 1886 dr
 mewbum regimental sergeant major a married man with the arrived and natur ally not being qualified i had illustrious name
 of bob belcher anyhow at the to take second place he at once got a combined end of the month
 we only paid our regular dues miners and police hospital built it was about a how the extras were paid
 i do not know mile from the barracks and the galt hospital was i saw louis riel at batoche and
 again when he later built on the same site the last time i was was in the gaol at regina
 most of the time the at lethbridge i saw the remains of the old hospital senior surgeon dr jukes saw
 him he was exa it was used i believe as a wood shed how ar e mining him as to
 mental qualifications and the the mighty fallen other prisoners were left to me i remember once one morning at lethbridge
 as i went down for when going on my rounds i had just spoken to sick par ade the commissioner
 and senior sur big bear who was all smiles and bows the geon were there i was told i was
 being returned to regular duty i asked the senior surgeon why stor ekeeper said my god man look out or
 you but he replied that he did not know i then applied will get a knife in your ribs that
 is the worst for a trial but did not get it so i did regular duty indian we have on
 the reserve however i was for 22 months there about six weeks and nothing happened while at lethbridge i was
 sent on detachment then i contracted typhoid fever or as it was to chin coulee one day whilst there two
 men then called typho ma laria and was in the hospital were sent out to me from lethbridge and were
 for six weeks as soon as i was returned to duty there about two weeks on my return from a
 patrol i was sent on detachment to the leavings close i saw our camp was deserted only my two dogs
 to where granum now is thirty miles from in it and no horses we had quite a time to find
 macleod i was still weak from the fever and had the horses cached in a side coulee and then dis
 to dismount and get in the wagon a few days covered our two men had deserted of course i after
 i got there i had orders to go out and arrest had to go to headquarters to report it after
 i made an indian on the peigan reserve i had a constable my statement the officer commanding sent for with
 me on our way back we stopped for a meal me how could they find their way over the border
 at the indian office on the reserve after the meal etc i had to reply excuse me sir but you
 fine i came out and found that the indian prisoner s two men three months pay and then send them
 horse had disappeared i searched for it but could out on detachment anyhow i did not get blamed not find
 it i asked the white men there but they i asked permission to move our chin coulee knew nothing about
 it finally i told them to hitch camping ground as the water was so bad it was up their wagon
 and we would take out prisoners making the men and horses sick i got permission in that one of the
 men passed me and said quietly and returned to my camp on the way back i had look behind the
 end house in the indian village taken my observation from the moon and a train i did so and found
 the horse we started out on the railroad to get my bearings finally i followed for some distance by jeering
 indians thought i had missed the road so i unharnessed when about two miles from fort macleod the my horse
 tied him up sat in the buckboard and lights clearly visible the constable who had a rope went to sleep
 in the morning i found i was within on the indian horse said sergeant some a few yards of the
 trail down to the coulee so i indians are coming and they will want to stop and proceeded down and
 found a cheerful camp talk i undid the halter shank off my own horse while i was away one of
 the horses had pawed and as they approached i called out to the constaat a spring opened it up and
 we had ver y good ble look out i am going to hit your hor ses and water don t
 stop i hit both the horses and they went shortly after we had orders to bring in all on all
 horses were tired as this was the end of detachments we were closest to lcthbridge forty los miles the four
 indians surrounded me but miles and waited for the others to come in i i let my horse walk on
 through them you see started the men off and stayed behind to see that if you meet one indian alone
 never take your eyes nothing was left putting my horse into a canter off him but if there are others
 they themselves he started to buck which i did not like so i kept are afraid to do anything because
 they cannot trust him at a fast trot we got to the hill out of the their own comrades we
 delivered our prisoner coulee and the teams had to double up when we to the guard room at fort macleod
 got to the top of the hill one of the teamsters asked another time i had been on a trip
 i believe it if he might change off for a little i told him he was something to do with
 elections and when i could ride my horse until we got close to leth got into the barracks i had
 a slight touch of snow bridge he did so he weighed over two hundred blindness the sergeant major asked me
 if i pounds my charger never bucked again would go on guard as they were short of non i was
 then on detachment at whoop up one commissioned officers i agreed but could easily day when i went into the
 store there the owner have got out of it i took precaution and got some asked me to put out
 a drunken indian i did so drops for my eyes from the hospital and as i pushed him out of
 the door i gave him after i had posted my sentries at night i had a friendly kick on the
 part he sat down on the three men on guard and four on picket i lay down p ‘ i

 of the north ‘ st mounted police barracks in l ethhridge in 1890 on the guard bed with my sword
 across my knees anyone else riding my charger i went to high feet on the floor covered my eyes from
 the light river met the other patrol and the next day i and the relief was so great that i
 fell asleep this started back was no crime as long as i had posted my men i had been over
 the trail only once before it a touch on my knees woke me up it was the started to snow
 and soon there was no trail to be orderly officer on his rounds visiting the sentries seen but my faithful
 animal knew more than i did and stables to see that ever ything was in order and earned me home
 as i got to the detachment he put me under arrest but agreed not to report the door was suddenly
 thrown open and someone my arrest until the guard changed next morning shouted sergeant have you got the key for
 your i never spoke to a man but when they were handcuffs naturally i had i ll look after your
 examined they all stated that i had inspected them hor se my questioner said if you ll release this therefore
 there was no crime i had apparently poor devil it was the cook he had burnt the done my duty
 and there was nothing against me supper the night before and to punish him they i may as well confess
 now after 10 00 p m i do had put on the handcuffs then they had searched not remember having
 gone out of the guardroom ever ywhere for the key but it was in my pocket i owed my getting
 free to the generosity of my the handcuffs had been on very tight and might comrades that was the spirit
 of the old force have affected his circulation if i had been away each would help the other all night
 while on detachment at the leavings we had in 1887 i was transferred to fort saskatcheto keep in touch also
 with the regular weekly wan so i started from calgary with three other patrol that went from calgary to high
 river the men a short distance out was a house and the day we were scheduled to go all horses
 but mine men asked if they might stop there i didn know had had enough work and as i did
 not want anything about the place so i said yes i would a cart carrying water follows the winding trail
 from the river to fort saskatchewan in 1884 hold the team a most charming young lady came a term used
 when the mentality was affected out with a tray on which was a wine glass i upon receipt of the
 news we left fort saskatchewan thanked her but told her i did not drink anything by team for edmonton then
 over the old trail for after much delay my three comrades came out athabasca we left there in two hudson
 s bay ver y hilarious we started off and all of a sudden boats each one pulled by about nine
 half breeds the tea mster fell over backwards out of the wagon we went up the athabasca against the stream
 until the other men simply roared with laughter but we came to mirror landing then the same did not attempt
 to touch the lines i climbed over process was continued up the slave river going from the back seat and
 caught them up by this up some r apids the rope of the boat i was in broke time all
 four horses were at a gallop heading for and but for the skill of george kennedy a half calgar y
 i managed to keep them circling and breed pilot i do not know what would have happicked up the teamster
 who had the luck of all pened we finally arrived at the lake and started drunken people he was unhurt
 i put another man to sail up it a storm having come up we stopped in charge of the driving
 twenty miles out we at an indian village and had some food i could found the stable at the stopping
 house had been not help remembering how clean the place was burnt and as we had orders to stable the
 horses even the porcelain dishes handed to us to eat from ever y night we went on to the next
 one near the were wiped as they were given to us the chief s present didsbury by this time the
 men were all wife was really a beautiful woman and he proudly hung over and feeling sorry for themselves my
 kept his eye on her all the time finally the storm brother in calgar y who had opened a branch
 of came to an end and we went on to grouard the bank of montreal there in 1886 had given
 while there we visited the two missions anglime a bottle of scotch whiskey before we left i can and roman
 catholic picking up our two opened it and gave them all a good drink pro prisoners at grouard we left
 and landed them mising i would keep it for them until the morning safely back at the fort the two
 were sentenced but somehow the bottle disappeared in the night to five years each in stony mountain in returning and
 i never saw it again them to edmonton en route to gaol the young without any further incident we eventually
 fellow s hat blew off somehow he jumped out arrived at fort saskatchewan there i learned of to get it
 and made his escape the old man went a murder that had taken place at grouard on for his five
 years it took us 29 ½ days to make lesser slave lake a father and son had killed the round
 trip the mother she was what they called a wetigo this year 1887 was queen victoria s jubilee all our
 men went to edmonton from the fort and to wood mountain and then to fort macleod we had a big
 parade in the morning of the celebra later i was re instated in my role of hospital tion i was
 the commanding officer s orderly sergeant and sent back to lethbridge when i got carr ying orders from superintendent griesbach
 to there i went through the records and discovered inspector snyder all went well until the men that all liquor
 called hospital comforts were started firing then my horse ran away and when under my charge and at the end
 of the month every i finally got him back the superintendent called drop had to be accounted for as we
 were under out to me look out that horse will kill canvas the liquor was kept in the basement of
 somebody the house of the officer commanding among the we gave three cheers for the queen and amid papers i
 found a receipt from one officer to another the noise my mount tried to get away again but for a
 quart of whiskey while on patrol duty of did not then the outfit marched to the camp course this was
 directly contrary to all orders i when i got back the veterinary sergeant said suffered for it but i knew
 i could do nothing about how do you like your mount doe the brute i said i never want to
 ride him again no he said i would not advise you to he is an outlaw he killed a man
 in calgar y in the spring of 1887 i was ordered by telegraph to go to wood mountain to become
 the medical man for b division after the summer was over i returned to lethbridge and wrote to king s
 college hospital london for my attendance roll of lectures i sent these to winnipeg and was informed that i would
 be accepted for my medical examinations i applied for leave explaining the situation and went to winnipeg whilst there taking
 my exams i considered that although i had kept up my medical work in a way i was nevertheless getting
 stale and another half term might make me more efficient colonel herchmer the commissioner was in winnipeg and i went
 to see him at first he absolutely refused to grant me further leave after my explanations he said will you
 give me your word of honour that you will re engage and promise to serve out your full time i
 did so explaining that it would be to my advantage and also to the advantage of the force to have
 a fully qualified medical man as a hospital sergeant at the examination i was not afraid of surgery but of
 medicine i came out well in the latter and nearly failed in surgery showing how easily our ambitions however calculated
 on come out anyhow i managed to pass and although the officers had always treated me as above my rank
 from this time on i was an officer in all but rank and name when i got back to the
 territories i went to medicine hat for a month then i believe back in the 1890 s braithwaite established a
 private medical practise in edmonton above is a view of jasper avenue looking east in 1891 whom i believe i
 still have it was to tell him i would not operate on anyone at this time there were four doctors
 at edmon unless i could see the patient for at least three days ton dr h c wilson was on
 the railroad most afterwards and i had to get back i discovered of the time dr h l mclnnis taking
 a post then what an idiot i had been not to stand by my graduate at vienna dr tofield had
 just left and original opinion which proved to be right gone to calgar y and myself in addition to these
 with some people dear old r g brett had the four was a french doctor who was sick in bed
 reputation of being a hard drinker the only time so i was the only man available i ever saw him
 the worse for liquor was when we a few months later i was told a young doctor had a medical
 association meeting at banff had arrived at the jasper house hotel i went down everyone who arrived had to have
 a drink with and found dr j d harrison i invited him up to him and even then i would
 not have called him my room and a friendship was started that lasted off his feet and that was the
 only time until he died before long we were together at all incidentally i had the first patient and peroperations
 we never became partners but always formed the first operation in the general hospital remained friends in edmonton i had
 to take my office chair down one of my first operations was an ovariotomy as an operating table i had
 the first operation in on a patient who had frequent attacks of epilepsy the edmonton city hospital afterwards merged i
 had the two senior doctors assisting me i doubt into the royal alexandra hospital my wife as if they had
 any experience in surger y when i head of the women s auxilliaiy was given the brought the ovar y
 up they both declared positively honour of opening the doors of the royal alexthat it was not the ovary naturally
 being my first andra i also performed the first operation here big operation i thought two heads were better than
 dr edgar allan had been promised this honour one and i might be wrong so i sewed up again but
 he generously turned the responsibility over i then wrote to old doctor brett he told me to to me as
 i was the senior practitioner i didn t send the patient down to banff which i did after know this
 until two weeks afterwards but i can which he told me to come down for the operation assure you i
 thanked him for being so decent when i arrived he asked me to perform it i when the misericordia hospital
 started they had refused finally the only way i could get out of a house nearly opposite the roman catholic
 cathedral to the best of my knowledge i attended knowledge i gave him all my work outside the the first
 confinement case there so i had some city as i had not the time to attend to it a little
 good luck in old edmonton later on he and all other coroners were dismissed in 1896 i was made a
 coroner for the govern when i went down to the attorney general s ment seventeen years later another man was
 department i was told they were going back to appointed and he informed everyone that he was the one man
 coroner business in 1926 i was now the senior coroner anyhow without his made provincial chief coroner some impressions of
 the canadian west the growth of the west in the past decade has been phenomenal and yet this is only
 a beginning of what may be expected splendid towns and villages will in a few years stand where today there
 is only the prairie primeval the railway that great civilizer has a very important part to play in bringing the
 centres of population nearer the land of the setting sun a traveller from eastern canada is impressed with the vastness
 of these western provinces and the fact that in a few years teeming millions will have made comfortable homes where
 today there is only prairie lands those who have resided in the canadian west for a few years are enthusiastic
 they see the vision of the future happy homes and far flung farming lands and prosperity and enter prise picking

 of satisfaction just about describes the report of the crops issued by the cpr it combines reports from every section
 of the prairie country clear through to the rockies and in its essence tells that all the wheat has been
 sown while the percentage of oats barley and flax which remains to be put is small ideal growing weather with
 light rains and plenty of warmth has been general over the entire northwest and in some places the growth has
 been exceptional for the early part of june in many sections the grain is reported to be up eight inches
 and in others from four to seven inches in the lacombe district where the scribe encountered a snow storm a
 few days ago the wheat is up from four to six inches and is looking excellent it is said that
 all over the west the acreage has increased canada for years has been called the granary of the empire and
 an italian economist has scored out the word empire and substituted mankind this writer adds the day is not far
 distant when canada cultivated with eager industry by the r obust arms of the immigrants who are crowding in will
 become the granary of the world as egypt was of the roman empire he estimates that in time the dominion
 will be able to put upon the market an amount of grain equal to half the world s total pr
