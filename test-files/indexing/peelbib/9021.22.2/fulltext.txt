 use of the banff springs when necessary his own way of life was swimming pool certain occupations were distinctive enough
 so as not to enable a closed to them even if they possessed the member of the larger community to

 it is apparent that the formation of the changed towards ethnic mninorities the ethnic community within the larger coifl perpetuation

 good candidate for the post after a short time in his new situation john mcdougall mastered another indian language known
 as swampy cree amid began a career of teaching preaching and trailblazing that was to last more than fifty years

 horses had to haul from the south east point of soumiding lake over the trackless prairie was very severe to
 here on them and in case of an accident or if froni the south east this hill presents one of
 them gave out we could not possibly the contour of an immense aquiline nose advance with its load but 1
 do not think it is from this resemi mbhence it takes its name as the natives here around soundim ig

 the devil s nose south east point a fair sized creek enters the lake in its valley is excellent soil
 and although he does not say soogilvie likely accompanied the mounted police patrol out sonic very good meadows there are
 also from battleford they were expecting trousome good and extensive meadows at the ble at the treaty payments as big
 bear was south west point of the lake there and had expressed dissatisfaction with the terms of the treaty as
 it happened a from sounding lake to the nose i number of shots were fired at the payments proceeded in
 a straight line and found the and big bear refused to sign the treaty but country to be the roughest

 and i left the nose on monday the 19 th wet weather i had to remain at the nose august
 and went about due south to red until the morning of monday the 19 th deer river the first 20
 miles was over august undulating prairie with many ponds of good i employed part of this time in exploring fresh
 water and an occasional meadow of the country north and west of it i found fair hay the soil is

 but as the time was very short and the river about 4 miles i occupied myself the weather very unsettled
 there may be a in getting observations for latitude and large error in this the height of sounding longitude the
