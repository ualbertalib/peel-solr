 6 the patrician 2008 message from the regimental major major e a liebert cd the theme of this year s 
 patrician is continuing the fight which emphasizes the regiment s unwavering commitment to canada s mission in afghanistan afghanistan dominated 
 the regiment s agenda in 2008 princess patricia s canadian light infantry returned to afghanistan in force when over 1 
 000 ppcli soldiers deployed to kandahar and kabul patricias serving in the battle group the operational mentoring and liaison team 
 and the special forces fought side by side with afghan soldiers and policemen as they worked to improve security and 
 develop afghan skills and professionalism ppcli soldiers working with the kandahar provincial reconstruction team protected diplomats development advisors police and 
 corrections personnel as they worked to improve afghans quality of life patricias also served in a range of headquarters across 
 afghanistan using their personal commitment and problem solving skills to promote teamwork and coordination all of the patricia battalions including 
 the loyal edmonton regiment contributed to this effort our attention tends to concentrate on the battalions but it is important 
 to note that patricias across canada including the ppcli association the regiment s families and supporters worked together to sustain 
 the mission although the regiment focused on afghanistan patricias also served on missions in europe the middle east and africa 
 the regiment lost 18 soldiers on active duty in afghanistan in 2008 many others were injured these casualties brought the 
 regimental family together and we worked very hard to honour our commitment to care for our wounded soldiers and the 
 families of the fallen patricias across canada mourned our losses and cared for the survivors these efforts are making a 
 difference the regiment s veterans care cell continues to monitor our wounded and the families of the fallen and the 
 ppcli association s volunteer patricia programme continues to reach out to patricias who need assistance particularly outside our major garrisons 
 bureaucracy remains a major obstacle to progress but our soldiers are benefiting from the growing number of programmes and services 
 although much remains to be done we are learning from our experiences and some of our more seriously wounded soldiers 
 have made incredible progress on the long road to recovery the regiment s bravery determination teamwork commitment to excellence and 
 personal sacrifices were recognized on a number of occasions throughout the year several patricias were awarded valour awards many more 
 received mentions in dispatches meritorious service decorations commanders commendations and achievement awards for their contributions to the canadian forces six 
 members of the ppcli association received commendations from the minister of veterans affairs in addition to the individual awards the 
 ppcli association received the canadian forces medallion for distinguished service for its exceptional dedication and outstanding leadership demonstrated through its 
 support to veterans canadian soldiers and their families ppcli officers and ncos continued their important work in schools and training 
 areas across canada much of this effort concentrated on preparing a new generation of soldiers for regimental service nine basic 
 infantry courses graduated from the land forces western area training centre in wainwright many of these soldiers are now working 
 hard to master the skills they will need to succeed in the difficult conditions in afghanistan three infantry officer serials 
 graduated from the infantry school in gagetown over the course of the year madame clarkson visited our soldiers in afghanistan 
 in august and met with many of our junior officers at exercise ric a dam doo in edmonton in november 
 where they gathered to learn about the regiment s history customs and traditions and the expectations of our soldiers and 
 senior leaders madame clarkson also visited the third battalion and the loyal edmonton regiment and thoroughly enjoyed another opportunity to 
 meet with soldiers and their families i will conclude my comments by thanking the regimental headquarters staff and everyone who 
 took the time to contribute articles and photographs for this year s patrician i also want to thank the ppcli 
 association and our corporate sponsors this publication would not be possible without your continued support mayor nolan crouse and the

 16 the patrician 2008 the regimental museum and archives 2008 was a year of change and transition at the ppcli 
 museum and archives captain dumas the museum and heritage officer was tasked to support the task force 1 08 operational 
 mentoring and liaison team in january 2008 lieutenant steve zivkow joined regimental headquarters in late january to continue captain dumas 
 s work on several museum projects and worked with the museum staff until early july lieutenant colin mackenzie joined regimental 
 headquarters in july and worked on communication projects and event coordination for the remainder of the year captain dumas returned 
 from afghanistan in september and assumed new duties as the regimental adjutant in november warrant officer ron gallant the assistant 
 curator and sergeant bruce graham the regimental archivist manned the museum and archives throughout the year providing some continuity and 
 working hard to improve the facility advance several museum projects and support events such as the hall of honour rededication 
 ceremony and conference of defence ministers in banff the staff worked very hard to improve the museum and archives support 
 regimental events and unit displays and prepare for the regiment s 100 th anniversary in 2014 the audiovisual systems throughout 
 the gallery were replaced and upgraded with new more efficient systems another major project improved access throughout the gallery making 
 it easier for visitors with mobility problems to move through the trench and medals displays major improvements were made to 
 the entrance display and a colour case was introduced to showcase the third battalion colours that were retired in croatia 
 in march 1993 this display will be rotated over time to display the other colours held by the museum another 
 major project focused on the ppcli hall of honour sadly the names of 18 brave ppcli soldiers were added to 
 the granite tablets in november so they would be commemorated on remembrance day the lighting in the hall of honour 
 was upgraded the book of remembrance was updated and a new bench was purchased to allow visitors to reflect on 
 the sacrifices made by the 1 857 patricias who have given their lives for our country on overseas operations other 
 projects included improvements to the world war i displays the world war ii weapons display and the afghanistan display several 
 exceptional medals groups were added to the museum collection including ken barwise s medals which include the military medal he 
 won at the battle of kapyong these medals will be placed on display at the second battalion in accordance with 
 his wishes lieutenant hugh mckenzie and major harry mullin s victoria crosses were sent to the canadian war museum for 
 inspection and conservation and were returned at the end of the year sergeant robert spall s victoria cross was loaned 
 to the royal canadian artillery museum in shilo where it will be displayed until 2011 work on the medals display 
 continues and major improvements to the regiment s victoria cross display will be unveiled in 2009 work also carried on 
 behind the scenes the museum and achives offices were moved in april to the archivists work area in the new 
 wing of the expanded museum complex this allowed the old office areas to be completely renovated storage improvements continued as 
 new cabinets were purchased to help protect the regiment s uniform and clothing collection sergeant graham received new computers and 
 a scanner to support his ongoing efforts to digitize the regiment s archival materials and photographs eventually this will make 
 the regiment s history and traditions much more accessible because much of this information will be available on the internet 
 the archives received several important donations including letters and poems written by soldiers serving in afghanistan one of the letters 
 was written by corporal james arnal and sent to a grade 5 class in his hometown shortly before he was 
 killed while these materials were greatly appreciated there is a requirement for a much more deliberate archiving effort to create 
 a more complete record of the regiment s service to canada patricias are asked to consider donating artefacts and archival 
 materials to support academic research and museum displays the museum and archives are looking for material from afghanistan the balkans 
 united nations missions the cold war and korea the museum and archives also need material on domestic operations and training

 with a growing number of injured soldiers and families of the fallen with ongoing operations in afghanistan as well as 
 regular exercises and unforeseen accidents our master casualty care matrix has grown from approx 115 cases to approximately 170 we 
 endeavour to speak with each soldier twice a year to address any new problems or issues where a soldier needs 
 advice or assistance navigating the ever growing medical care system the ppcli regimental veterans care cell rvc consists of ncos 
 working carefully to ensure our wounded and families are looked after wo shultz dg and mcpl robson mp stay current 
 with all listing injured soldiers and families of the fallen as well as a detailed knowledge of who to contact 
 with each specific situation also joining the rhq team is maj mark campbell transitioning from his former position with the 
 omlt on tf 1 8 0:1 0:8 he will be auditing and improving on the existing directives concerning care of 
 the injured an nco from 3 ppcli will e assigned with regularly updating and reporting to rhq with any new 
 developments from that battalion cfb shilo will e represented by an nco trained by sgt whelan as he is deploying 
 on tour and don t forget that all reservists and support rades attached to the ppcli when injured fall under 
 the rvc cell umbrella left to right pte rob webster wo dave shultz and mcpl monty robson the rvc cell 
 works closely with all assisting officers aos case managers cms as well as the newly organized and developed joint personnel 
 support unit jpsu from numerous lessons learned we have recognised that a number of soldiers will leave their platoon after 
 being injured and after weeks and months of recovery lose contact and the bond they had with that team the 
 war continues army training continues and platoons change personnel from the privates all the way up to platoon commanders and 
 warrant officers unfortunately when this happens people are forgotten as the focus must remain on war fighting skills enter the 
 ppcli rvc cell as soon as a soldier is injured the rvc cell begins to track all pertinent information meet 
 with the soldier when possible and explain the plethora of resources available from our medical organizations veterans affairs canada vac 
 service income security insurance plan sisip director casualty support management dcsm and the mental health system the return to work 
 program rtw has been more successful than it was in the past due to the soldiers feeling like they are 
 still part of the team from the time they are injured to the immediately required medical attention operation small pack 
 and somebody to maintain a soldier to soldier link after they ve left their comrades the rvc cell ensures that 
 feelings of abandonment or being forgotten are eliminated we do not discriminate between rank trade or component and will make 
 all efforts to keep the chain of command apprised of new developments and needs of all injured soldiers please take 
 the time to visit the jpsu website for more detailed explanation of that unit as well as contact information the

 the patrician 2008 55 french grey battalion in 2008 the infantry school saw a growing number of students conduct training 
 at all levels the cf wide push to replenish its ranks has placed a significant weight on the staff at 
 cfb gagetown members of all three battalions of the princess patricia s canadian light infantry work at the school and 
 are currently involved in the task of growing and modernizing the training system at an alarming rate since task force 
 1 06 returned from afghanistan in august 2006 the army s intent has been to employ as many combat veterans 
 in training centers as possible this theme has been apparent at the infantry school where the vast majority of instructors 
 have experienced war first hand this increase in experience has had a dramatic effect on training and has resulted in 
 the development of more technologically advanced applicable training opportunities for candidates the philosophy held by the leadership at the school 
 is to adapt current training in order to maintain the key canadian doctrine required to wage war but also modify 
 course content to make the training relevant to the current theatre of operations in an ongoing effort to stay ahead 
 of the technology curve the infantry school is working closely with the army learning support center alsc to modernize instructional 
 methods for all courses the new methods emphasize distance learning packages which enable candidates to conduct online training ftpm their 
 home units once candidates arrive in gagetown for formal training they are exposed to a variety of new computer animations 
 and training simulations that improve the learning curve and maximize training resources lie infantry school is actively involved in the 
 procurement of new weapons and the subsequent development oj training programs for battle groups deploying to afghanistan the most notable 
 project currently underway is the company area suppression weapon casw which is an spjtomatic grenade launcher a weapon that is

 nova scotia the guest speaker was lieutenant colonel wilson who represents the ppcli as the co of the french grey 
 battalion also representing the regular force was captain lee mossop currently serving as the operations officer at the infantry school 
 the meeting served to provide an overview of the regiment s current status for serving and retired members of the

 ended their time with the regiment through retirement promotions include major terry wilson s promotion to lieutenant colonel he who

 57 the patrician 2008 lfwatc the year of 2008 was yet another busy one for the land force western area 
 training centre in wainwright as the conduct of soldier qualification basic infantry qualification and combat service support related courses continued 
 at their steady pace and the requirements for qualified junior leaders with the primary leader qualification expanded with the increase 
 in the size of the infantry sections being planned for deployment into afghanistan the personnel challenges posed by the ongoing 
 deployment to afghanistan were felt as the outflow of soldiers through postings retirement and operational tasks created shortages in the 
 permanent staff that could not be addressed until the conclusion of the task force 1 08 deployment when their designated 
 replacements could be posted in while this challenge was successfully addressed through significant double hatting and extra hours some of 
 the adventure training activities that had marked previous years were of necessity curtailed however the extra curricular sports and activities 
 engaged in by many of the ppcli staff continued perhaps none more noteworthy than the display of boxing skills by

 in the cf although the royal canadian regiment rcr was heavily involved in the unit s initial formation there is 
 considerable ppcli representation at csor and the ppcli cap badge on a tan beret is an increasingly common sight around

 fall into two streams the first focuses on what commanding officer lcol greg smith refers to as high quality sof 
 skills developing excellence in fighting and manoeuvring in urban arctic jungle mountain desert and littoral environments this first stream drives 
 a large portion of the individual and collective training and includes a focus on mastering small arms and support weapons 
 developing superior complex terrain skills physical fitness icqb skills and developing multi platform capability the second stream focuses on support 
 to cansofcom compared to edmonton or even brandon petawawa may seem isolated but the ottawa valley is brimming with outdoor 
 recreation opportunities and ottawa is conveniently close enough for weekend excursions patricias at csor have found the working environment as

 the patrician 2008 63 a personal memoir of korea my military career before and during the battle of kapyong a 
 personal memoir by michael czuboka part i joining the special force for korea i was born in brandon manitoba to 
 ukrainian immigrant parents in 1931 my father a canadian national cn section labourer like thousands of other ukrainians was unjustly 
 interned by canadian authorities during ww i simply because he was classified as a citizen of the austrian hungarian empire 
 an enemy of britain and canada during the first world war the ukrainians ironically had come to canada to gain 
 freedom from an oppressive and foreign regime i believe that my father wanted his three sons to be good canadians 
 but that he was probably never able to overcome his belief that he was an unwanted foreigner in canada if 
 he had lived long enough he would certainly have been proud of the fact that all three of his sons 
 walter bill and mike would eventually become commissioned officers in the canadian forces it is certainly true that i as 
 a young man needed to prove that i was a good canadian and that this was one of the reasons 
 i joined the canadian army in 1950 in the summer of 1950 i was an 18 year old construction labourer 
 living in rivers manitoba acn railway town and working on renovation projects at the nearby canadian joint air training centre 
 cjatc i graduated with a grade 12 senior matriculation standing but jobs were scarce and i considered myself fortunate to 
 have employment of any kind i wanted to further my studies with a university degree in either arts or science 
 but neither my parents nor i had any money for that purpose i grew up in rivers and i was 
 impressed by the young soldiers sailors and airmen who served at cjatc and especially those who wore wings while attending 
 high school in rivers i became an air cadet gained military experience by attending summer camps at air force bases 
 and was promoted to sergeant the highest cadet rank in 320 rivers squadron my older brother walter as a flying 
 officer with the royal canadian air force had completed 52 air missions over the atlantic ocean and europe during wwii 
 and i admired him greatly i was too young to serve in the war and i felt that i had 
 been left out of a great and exciting historical event a military career greatly appealed to me and the korean 
 war would eventually give me a chance for the kind of an adventure that i had missed during ww ii

 personal memoir of korea the patrician 2008 64 the korean war broke out in june 1950 and later in that 
 summer the canadian government announced that it would recruit a special force for the purpose of serving in the war 
 what was especially appealing to many recruits about this force was its limited 18 month period of service in those 
 days those who enlisted in the canadian forces were usually required to enlist for at least three years moreover it 
 was practically impossible to get out earlier than three years it was almost like being in the french foreign legion 
 you signed your life and freedom away the canadian army in those days was lacking in sensitivity and human relations 
 skills soldiers did not have any rights as we know them today you were required to obey all orders without 
 questions of any kind it was a joke but also a reality when lieutenants or sergeants or even corporals said 
 i need three volunteers to go on a dangerous patrol and i have decided that the volunteers will be you 
 you and you in early august 1950 shortly after the special force enlistments began at recruiting depots across canada i 
 decided to travel from rivers to fort osborne in winnipeg a distance of about 125 miles in order to join 
 up but how would i get there my funds were limited fortunately i knew a cn railway fireman and he 
 smuggled me into a caboose at the end of a freight train going to winnipeg i arrived full of enthusiasm 
 but was initially rejected because of my age how old are you the recruiting officer asked sceptically you look like 
 you are about 15 i know that i look younger but i am 18 years old i truthfully replied that 
 s too young to be in the special force he said you have to be at least 19 go home 
 and come again when you are 19 i did go back to rivers but i returned to fort osborne about 
 two weeks later and hesitatingly and with considerable trepidation told another recruiting officer that i was 19 years old he 
 did not look at me too closely and did not seem to care i was a warm body and the 
 army was not too particular i was never asked for a birth certificate or documentation of any kind either then 
 or ever i aged by one year instantaneously and was immediately enrolled at my request into the princess patricia s 
 canadian light infantry i wanted adventure and the infantry was the place to get it on august 22 1950 at 
 about the time i was scheduled to travel by train to the ppcli in calgary canada s railway workers went 
 on strike the problem was solved by the royal canadian air force i along with other recruits from winnipeg s 
 osborne barracks were loaded onto c 47 dakota aircraft and flown to calgary we arrived a lot of us sick 
 and vomiting because of a bumpy ride on a hot august day and were immediately housed at currie barracks unfortunately 
 the army was not ready to receive us and we languished for many days in our civilian clothing finally in 
 about mid september we were equipped with ww ii vintage uniforms webbing kit bags boots mess tins and 303 lee 
 enfield rifles shortly afterwards we were shipped to wainwright alberta to undergo basic training our training was under the command 
 of lieutenant colonel big jim stone the co of 2 ppcli and brigadier john rockingham commander of the 25th infantry 
 brigade both officers had had served with distinction in ww 11 in fact most of our senior non commissioned and 
 commissioned officers were veterans of the war that had ended only five years earlier part ii training for the korean 
 war and sailing to korea camp wainwright was located on the sandy site of the former 25 square mile buffalo 
 national park in central alberta it served as an artillery armoured and infantry training area during wwii and briefly as 
 a german prisoner of war camp at the end of the war its facilities were expanded considerably at the beginning 
 of the korean war but in november 1950 it was decided that the entire 25th canadian brigade would be moved 
 to fort lewis washington because of the better facilities at that location it was apparently cheaper to rent from the 
 united states than to spend a lot of money on wainwright we did not complain the idea of living and 
 training near seattle a large american city was very appealing to the men of all ranks seattle we reasoned probably 
 contained a lot of beautiful women who were anxious to consort with handsome and heroic canadian soldiers in late november 
 1950 several trains began transporting soldiers from my regiment the ppcli and 
 personal memofr of korea 65 the patrician 2008 other units from wainwright to fort lewis we were loaded onto old 
 wooden colonial railway coaches these ancient and fragile vehicles had originally been used to haul immigrants like my parents to 
 the canadian prairies tragedy stuck on november 21 1950 when two trains including a troop train collided at canoe river 
 in british columbia killing 21 people including 17 soldiers from the royal canadian horse artillery investigators later decided that these 
 deaths were caused primarily by the weaknesses of the wooden coaches in which we were travelling it was alleged by 
 some that the government and military authorities were negligent because of their decision to transport soldiers in these ancient and 
 dangerous conveyances the investigators noted that none of the civilians who were riding in modern and strong steel coaches died 
 in this collision and concluded that the soldiers had died as a result of government cost cutting shortly after our 
 arrival at fort lewis the canadian government decided that only the 2nd battalion princess patricia s canadian light infantry would 
 be sent to korea on an immediate basis the communist forces of north korea had been pushed back to the 
 yalu river on the border with china and general douglas mac arthur the united nations commander had declared that the 
 war would be over by christmas it appeared that 2 ppcli was being sent as a token occupation force and 
 that the rest of the brigade would probably not follow when i arrived at fort lewis on november 21 1950 
 i was a rifleman in the ppcli one day a number of us were called to a special parade and 
 we were told that we were being re assigned most were sent to rifle companies but when my name was 
 called out i was told that i was now a member of 2 ppcli s 81 mm mortar platoon mortar 
 platoon i asked myself what is a mortar platoon and what will i be doing i vaguely remembered seeing mortars 
 in ww ii movie newsreels but i knew next to nothing about them i would not see any 81 mm 
 mortars until after we arrived in korea i wondered why and how i was assigned to the mortar platoon and 
 i concluded that it was simply an arbitrary decision and not for any particular reason that s how the army 
 worked in those days on november 25th after only four days at fort lewis we were shipped to port angeles 
 and loaded onto the private j p martinez a rusting liberty ship from ww 11 these vessels had been welded 
 together for temporary use and did not appear to be very seaworthy the facilities were crude and the food was 
 almost inedible i still shudder over the memory of seeing large black cooks sweating into the soup and food that 
 they prepared in the galleys for our consumption we had coloured meal cards and ate at badly coordinated times to 
 announcements on loudspeakers such as yellow cards will chow now will chow now the weather was some of the worst 
 in memory and even the ship s crew were seasick i spent the first week in my bunk flat on 
 my back and next to my rifle the bunks were six deep 
 a personal memoir of korea 66 the patrician 2008 2 ppcli sails to korea on pvt joe p martinez and 
 jammed together in the hold the odour of unwashed bodies and feet was almost unbearable moreover we learned about half 
 way across the stormy and badlynamed 0:badly 0:named pacific that the chinese had entered korea in large numbers and that 
 the united nations forces were in retreat we were going to a full scale war and not occupation duties as 
 previously announced after about 23 days including briel stopovers in hawaii and japan we arrived al in south korea we 
 disembarked to the sounds of a welcoming u s military band we were in the land of the morning calm 
 the nickname sometimes given to korea it was december 18th and we had arrived just in time to prepare for 
 christmas part iii korea from december 1950 to april 1951 pusan was a collection of huts and ramshackle buildings that 
 housed tens of thousands of refugees a pungent odour of charcoal fish and human excrement filled our nostrils fortunately we 
 did not stay long big jim stone advised general walker his american superior that we were not ready to fight 
 and needed about six weeks of training general walker reluctantly agreed but not until after stone produced formal instructions that 
 he had received from ottawa we were moved to an orchard area near miryang about 50 kms north of pusan 
 and our training there lasted until mid february we also spent some time in the neighbouring hills hunting guerrillas it 
 was at miryang that i first learned how to use an 81 mm mortar i was assigned to a number 
 two position my responsibility was to feed bombs or shells into my mortar feeding bombs into the barrel of a 
 mortar required good coordination because a double feed into a barrel would cause an explosion and wipe out the whole 
 mortar crew as happened on more than one occasion our platoon had six half tracks with a three man mortar 
 crew each each half track had one 50 calibre and one 30 calibre machine gun mounted we carried several hundreds 
 bombs most of which were of the high explosive variety and a few that were made of phosphorus and used 
 for creating smoke range was determined by an elevation finding sight on the side of the mortar small packages of 
 explosives called charges were added or removed at the end of each bomb for the purpose of increasing or decreasing 
 distances of delivery in later years i learned that mortars are considered by military experts to be extremely effective infantry 
 weapons what i remember most about miryang is the clean relatively odourless air the cosy sleeping bags folding cots and 
 tents where we slept and the hot food it was in an orchard area and human excrement was not spread 
 on the fields and rice paddies as in most parts of korea after leaving miryang and for the rest of 
 my tour in korea i slept in a slit trench or simply on the ground and ate canned american c 
 rations most of the time more than once during the cold korean winter i woke up only to find myself 
 covered in snow the first year in korea was one of rapid movement we moved frequently from february to april 
 it was not until the fall of 1951 that both sides began to prepare relatively permanent defensive trenches and 
 the patrician 2008 67 a personal memoir of korea bunkers that were reminiscent of those that were used in ww 
 i during most of the period between mid february and mid april the chinese gradually retreated northwards seoul was retaken 
 in mid march and the un forces including our battalion began to push across the 38th parallel and into north 
 korea during these first few weeks of combat 2 ppcli had 14 killed and 42 wounded casualties were light compared 
 to those suffered by canadians in ww i and ww 11 but we were certainly in a real war and 
 not a police action my own problems were relatively minor on one occasion when i was feeding bombs into our 
 mortar on a rapid fire basis a delayed action took place one of the bombs did not emerge from the 
 barrel as was anticipated i instinctively lifted my head next to the barrel in keeping with normal procedure and i 
 was greeted with a loud explosion as the faulty projectile exited blood immediately came out of both ears as a 
 result i suffered a permanent hearing disability in early march when it was still very cold i was stricken by 
 a serious case of dysentery i lost total control of my bowel movements i became very sick and was loaded 
 onto an indian jeep ambulance and was transported along with two seriously wounded chinese soldiers to an american mash hospital 
 i still remember the groans and occasional screams of my chinese companions during our bumpy ride i remained at the 
 mash hospital for about one week i was visited only once in the hospital by an obviously inebriated canadian sergeant 
 who thought that i had been wounded in action when the sergeant found out that i had dysentery and not 
 a wound he quickly terminated his visit as previously mentioned the army in the 1950 s was not known for 
 its sensitivity proud to support princess patricia s canadian light infantry 
 a personal memoir of korea 68 the patrician 2008 i was also infected with malaria in korea but it did 
 not surface until the summer of 1952 when i was taking a course at camp borden in ontario flash forward 
 about a year it took the doctors at camp borden hospital several days to diagnose my illness my temperature rose 
 rapidly to about 106 degrees and i became delirious two young and attractive female lieutenant nurses rubbed my mostly naked 
 body with alcohol to bring my soaring temperature down i was a shy corporal at the time but i was 
 having hallucinations and i mischievously asked you are really enjoying this aren t you fortunately they chose to ignore my 
 remark corporals in those days were expected to always speak to lieutenants in respectful terms flash back to korea in 
 the middle of february 1951 our battalion was loaded onto trucks and halftracks 0:half 0:tracks at miryang in preparation for 
 our move to the front at that time about 200 kms to the north i remember the cloudy skies snow 
 covered valleys and mountains icy and winding roads and the bitter sub zero cold it took us about two days 
 to get from miryang to the front very cold arctic winds from nearby siberia often descend down the korean peninsula 
 and they certainly came frequently in the winter of 1950 51 as we arrived on our half tracks at the 
 korean village of kudun near the front line we were suddenly confronted with a scene of horror i had never 
 seen a dead body until that day but now something like 68 black and mostly naked american bodies were scattered 
 all around us they had been bayoneted and shot by the chinese and their weapons and clothing had been removed 
 they were frozen solid and looked like black marble statues some were magnificent physical specimens and i remember feeling overwhelmed 
 with pity over their horrible fate we were later told that this had been a black infantry company some had 
 their ring fingers cut off and their winter clothing sleeping bags boots and weapons had been removed the chinese coveted 
 american clothing and weapons and took them whenever they could apparently these black american soldiers led by white officers had 
 posted a single sentry on the previous evening and had not dug slit trenches although only about 68 bodies were 
 counted on that day it was subsequently reported that more than 200 had been killed in later years i read 
 a report by the chinese communist forces ccf 116 th division which claimed that two companies of the u s 
 23rd infantry regiment had been annihilated at dawn on february 14 1951 american infantry companies do hold about 100 soldiers 
 so if two companies were wiped out 200 dead seems like a reasonable estimate the chinese had a habit of 
 removing dead bodies and especially their own i was shocked by this bloody spectacle and ate very little for the 
 next several days i knew that we were in a war but i was not prepared for such a sudden 
 and violent introduction i noticed that my three companions on our half track were also taking it badly all had 
 turned very pale and silent our commanding officer lieutenant colonel jim stone on the other hand considered this to an 
 important lesson for all of us we would in future never be allowed to use sleeping bags in the front 
 line and needless to say it became apparent that a strong contingent of sentries was always needed and especially at 
 dawn the time when the chinese preferred to attack part iv the battle of kapyong the chinese spring offensive of 
 april 1951 turned out to be the greatest battle of the korean war the introduction to hub gray s excellent 
 book beyond the danger close states that a part of this offensive began immediately north of kapyong when 10 000 
 men of the south korean 6th division panicked and fled running south leaving a 16 km gap in the front 
 line two chinese divisions with 20 000 men blitzed southward 40 km in 36 hours to kapyong where the badly 
 outnumbered 1 700 men of 2 ppcli and 3 rar were ordered to hold the line according to gray 2 
 ppcli was considerably under strength at this time with only about 700 soldiers in the front line rather than a 
 full battalion component of 940 in the meantime a few miles further west the british gloucester battalion heroically held its 
 ground and was virtually wiped out most of the gloucesters were either killed or captured and only about 56 out 
 of about 900 survived the battle our fate could easily have been the same of course we we did know 
 any of these details at that time we were simply told that the chinese were attacking in large numbers and 
 that we would have to stop them 
 the patrician 2008 69 in late april we were in a reserve position in the kapyong area our activities included 
 cleaning weapons undergoing kit inspections and replenishing our supplies of ammunition and other supplies we appreciated getting periods of uninterrupted 
 and peaceful sleep japanese asahi beer was available and eagerly consumed for the first time in several weeks we enjoyed 
 hot meals american c rations which we used in front line positions consisted of predictable and boring cans of meat 
 vegetables and fruit late april also brought spring to korea the weather was warm and pleasant and i have often 
 wondered if it was at this time that a malaria infected mosquito bit me unfortunately our respite was quickly and 
 rudely interrupted our commanding officer big jim stone was suddenly ordered to take 2 ppcli to positions on hill 677 
 north of the village of kapyong at the same time the 3rd battalion of the royal australian regiment was instructed 
 to occupy hill 504 a lower feature located immediately across from hill 677 the valley below was a critical part 
 of main route to the south korean capital of seoul and the chinese understood that they needed to control hills 
 677 and 504 to allow a safe passage southward lieutenant colonel stone demonstrated his competence and experience as a veteran 
 of ww ii by taking his company commanders on a reconnaissance of hill 677 captain lloyd hill our 81 mm 
 mortar platoon commander also accompanied this group we were later told that stone and his officers studied the approaches that 
 the chinese would likely use during their attack companies and platoons were to be deployed as much as possible in 
 mutually supporting positions the advantage of hill 677 was that it contained many very steep approaches which meant that the 
 attackers would often have to monkey run upwards to get at us in those days the mountains of korea had 
 very few trees and visibility was unrestricted during visits to kapyong in 2003 and 2008 i was amazed at how 
 hill 677 and other korean mountains were now covered with thick forests in april 1951 the mountains were mostly bare 
 and the chinese were especially vulnerable to grenades that were rolled down towards them on the steep and visible slopes 
 to a large extent however the defence of hill 677 would depend upon artillery and 81 mm mortar fire at 
 first it looked as though we would not be able to get our half tracks and 81 mm mortars to 
 the top of hill 677 lieutenant lome hurst the pioneer platoon commander said that our half tracks could not make 
 it up because of the very narrow track stone did not agree according to hub gray stone growled at hurst 
 and said hurst get the half tracks up that bloody hill no one ever questioned stone s orders and hurst 
 quickly complied in retrospect it can be concluded that the survival of the entire battalion eventually depended to a large 
 extent upon the 81 mm mortar platoon our supporting new zealand and american artillery batteries were also very important but 
 they were not as readily available as our mortars if the mortar platoon had not reached the top of hill 
 677 it would probably a personal memoir of korea pit o d i c t s limited suppliers of quality

 personal memoir of korea the patrician 2008 70 have been ineffective if fact if we had been left in the 
 valley below we would have been very vulnerable and likely would have been eliminated by the chinese very quickly the 
 chinese were swarming all over the valley below as it turned out our 50 calibre machine guns deployed in a 
 key position on hill 677 and commanded by lieutenant hub gray second in command of the mortar platoon would soon 
 afterwards save the entire battalion from total destruction i vividly recall our ascent with our heavily loaded half tracks onto 
 hill 677 it was getting dark and difficult to see anything the route consisted of a single narrow trail and 
 wound dangerously back and forth on its way to the summit a slide into one of the deep ravines that 
 bordered the trail would have been disastrous in some places the trail was blocked with large stone outcrops and these 
 had to be blown away with explosives then when we were almost at the top one of our half tracks 
 broke down stone threatened to push it into a nearby deep ravine fortunately a mechanic bob hoffman arrived and revived 
 the vehicle which had apparently stopped because of a dead battery soon after arriving near the top of hill 677 
 we unloaded our mortars and set them up in small rice paddies the ground was very hard and it was 
 impossible to dig down more than a few inches however the rice paddies with their stone walls did offer some 
 protection my number one robbie roberts and i unloaded all of our mortar bombs in a pile close to our 
 mortar i believe that we had about 2 000 mortar rounds on board the whole platoon probably hauled about 12 
 000 mortar bombs to the top of hill 677 i recall that our half track was so full that we 
 were forced to sit haphazardly on top of our heavy and volatile load a single enemy shell or rocket could 
 easily have instantly detonated the whole load and blown all of us to kingdom come the other five mortars were 
 set up similarly on rice paddies that were close to ours i dismounted the 30 calibre machine gun from our 
 half track as i usually did in order to provide additional protection left to right robbie roberts 81 mm mortar 
 and mike czuboka korea february 1951 we were assigned defensive fire tasks this allowed us to zero in on the 
 places where the chinese were likely to attack these targets were called fox 1 fox 2 fox 3 and so 
 on when the chinese later attacked one or more of our rifle companies we were given commands such as rapid 
 fire on fox 1 during that first night hundreds of shadowy figures poured past us in a southerly direction we 
 were told 
 4 personal memoir of korea the patrician 2008 71 that these pathetic and usually weaponless men were remnants of the 
 republic of korea 6th division but we were not sure they could have been chinese and north koreans and it 
 is entirely possible that some of them were indeed our enemies infiltration was a common communist tactic these unwelcome intruders 
 sometimes came to within 50 meters of our position and they made us extremely nervous then we sat and waited 
 the chinese decided to attack the australians on hill 504 first and from our position high on hill 677 we 
 had a grandstand view of the battle large numbers of chinese soldiers were seen massing in the valley below several 
 american tanks were engaged in the battle and one was knocked out the americans performed heroically even though they were 
 engulfed in large numbers of swarming chinese we later learned that three of the american tank commanders were killed and 
 that the australians had 33 men killed and 58 wounded before they were overrun and forced to withdraw from hill 
 504 we were now alone and the chinese turned their attention in our direction the first chinese attacks were against 
 baker company the company s three platoons with about 30 men each were located approximately 200 meters to the northeast 
 of our position because baker overlooked the valley it is likely that the chinese considered it to have the most 
 important strategic position able charlie and dog companies were situated in higher isolated positions to the north and west of 
 baker company and further away from the river valley although we were close to baker company and could hear all 
 of the violent battle noises we did not at that time know about all of the hand to hand fighting 
 that was taking place baker was being subjected to typical chinese communist force tactics including bugles and human waves we 
 fired hundreds of mortar rounds in support of the company but we were not able to directly observe the results 
 of our action but we were very effective for instance lieutenant charles petrie of baker company later recalled that on 
 one occasion as dusk approached 6 platoon reported that the enemy was forming up in a re entrant and preparing 
 for an attack our battalion 81 mm mortars opened fire on this force and decimated it somewhat later 6 platoon 
 fixed bayonets and forced the chinese to retreat mortars are an extremely effective infantry weapon but bayonets can also be 
 very persuasive under the right circumstances the next two days and nights are a blur in my memory we frequently 
 fired large volleys of mortar bombs in support of the rifle companies and in particular baker and dog after trying 
 and failing to dislodge baker company the chinese attacked dog company in large numbers lieutenant mike levy the commander of 
 dog company s 12 platoon initiated a mortar and artillery bombardment of i r n ii i h h i

 a personal memoir of korea 72 the patrician 2008 his own position in order to stem the chinese assaults we 
 were told that we were surrounded and to expect an assault on our position at any time the attack that 
 we were expecting came in the evening of april 24th we did not immediately notice their presence but about 500 
 chinese began to climb from the valley floor towards our location they were advancing quietly in our direction and they 
 were not signalling their approach with bugles and loud shouts as was their usual habit lieutenant hub gray quickly took 
 command of the eight 50 calibre machine guns that were mounted on our half tracks whether by a stroke of 
 genius or as a result of sheer luck these vehicles were located in a very favourable position for the purpose 
 of confronting the advancing enemy the machine guns were mounted on circular swivels and could be turned rapidly to any 
 direction gray handled this critical situation efficiently and calmly he waited until the leading formation of chinese was only about 
 40 meters short of our position before giving the command to fire the eight 50 calibre machine guns opened up 
 and began cutting a bloody swath in the communist ranks i have often wondered by hub gray was never given 
 any kind of recognition for his very significant and important action at the very least in my opinion gray should 
 have been mentioned in dispatches unfortunately military awards are not always given in a fair and objective manner i was 
 totally unaware of the approaching enemy until the moment that gray opened fire we were as usual doing defensive fire 
 tasks for the rifle companies as soon as we became aware of the chinese in our vicinity we turned our 
 mortars around about 180 degrees raised them up to an almost perpendicular angle and began launching bombs on a rapid 
 fire basis our mortar bombs travelled only about 100 to 200 metres and began landing in the midst of the 
 chinese it was a devastating slaughter jim wall a private in the pioneer platoon described the scene as follows in 
 beyond the danger close approaching our position in the dull light on night they looked like a bunch of ants 
 groping their way up the hill it is frightening watching them slowly ascend and to realize that they are coming 
 to kill us when gray orders the machine guns to fire there are masses of the fallen dead and wounded 
 those left standing grab what they can of their casualties and are running and tumbling down the hill heading for 
 the river on the following day one of our men went to the killing field counted more than 100 dead 
 chinese and then stopped counting it is highly likely that many other bodies had been dragged away in keeping with 
 chinese practice the battle of kapyong ended very unexpectedly on april 25th and 26th by that time our mortar platoon 
 was almost completely out of mortar bombs the rifle companies were also down to a few rounds of ammunition our 
 food and water was almost gone we were in a desperate situation but for some reason the communists did not 
 continue with their attacks however the trails and roads leading to and from hill 677 still appeared to be occupied 
 by the enemy and lieutenant colonel stone radioed for help on the morning of april 25th several flying boxcars of 
 the united states air force suddenly roared over our position parachutes of various colours opened up and drifted into our 
 position i eagerly helped to open up the canisters and discovered that we had been supplied with mortar bombs rifle 
 and machine gun ammunition c rations and water a minor miracle had taken place robbie roberts and i piled our 
 fresh supply of bombs next to our mortar we were ready for action once more but everything remained strangely silent 
 we were not called upon to fire again on the 26th of april we were ordered to re load our 
 half tracks in preparation for a move from hill 677 our descent down hill 677 was full of tension we 
 did not know if the chinese were still present but nothing happened and we eventually reached the main road in 
 the river valley a regimental combat team of the u s army had arrived to take our place as we 
 drove southward a powerful feeling of relief surged through my mind and body in spite of very difficult circumstances we 
 had somehow survived but what were the reasons for our survival i did not give this question much thought in 
 april 1951 but in later years i concluded that the chinese had stopped their attacks at kapyong because of their 
 very heavy losses in particular i believe that the machine guns firing in unison under hub gray s command 
 a personal memoir of korea the patrician 2008 73 saved all of us at kapyong their thunderous firepower decimated the 
 advancing communist force of about 500 the chinese having already suffered very heavy losses must have felt that they had 
 suddenly encountered a powerful and well armed enemy according to hub gray 2 ppcli had 35 wounded and 12 killed 
 at kapyong which is more than the official total of 23 wounded and 10 killed apparently some casualties on hill 
 677 took place before the actual battle began and were therefore not officially counted in any event the 35 or 
 45 casualties suffered by the patricias during the chinese april offensive was a lot less than the approximately 850 by 
 the gloucesters or 91 by the australians the united nations forces in total had about 7 000 casualties the patricia 
 delegation in front of the kapyong battle monument kapyong korea i believe that our limited losses happened for the following 
 reasons the patricias were located on a high mountain with steep slopes that were difficult to climb by the attackers 
 and the battalion also had massive artillery and mortar support that decimated the chinese when they charged hub gray has 
 calculated and observed that in addition to the battalion s 81 mm mortars support was provided by 81 artillery pieces 
 of the new zealanders and americans that extensive firepower was brought to bear on very small areas in front of 
 and on top of our companies and it killed thousands of chinese sundance spas a division of pools spas of

 a personal memoir of korea 74 the patrician 2008 an additional factor was that the communists had advanced very quickly 
 over a long distance and that they were unable to bring up supplies and heavy weapons quickly enough moreover the 
 air was controlled by the american air force which attacked the communists at every opportunity lieutenant colonel john bishop in 
 his very interesting book the king s bishop provides an excellent observation in regard to the significance of the battle 
 of kapyong bishop served as a corporal with 2 ppcli s able company at kapyong he was later commissioned and 
 retired after 35 years of service in the canadian army he points out in his book that if the patricias 
 had not held at kapyong the way would have been open for the chinese to drive the un forces back 
 to seoul and ultimately all the way to pusan and into the sea he notes that when kapyong a relatively 
 small battle is put into context the stemming of the chinese spring offensive entailed a massive loss of lives and 
 material comparable in scale to many of the engagements of wwi the un had about 7 000 casualties during april 
 1951 but the chinese total of about 70 000 was much more although the battle of kapyong took place more 
 than a half a century ago i still vividly remember my involvement as a 19 year old private occasionally i 
 dream that i am returning to korea and that the communists have invaded once again this dream never changes i 
 am excited but not afraid because i know that i am going to survive and return home it is not 
 an unpleasant dream of greater significance is the fact that i still feel a strong attachment to my regiment it 
 is still even after many years something like a family to me once a patricia always a patricia is certainly

 serving diligently to support those on the front lines it has been said that in recent times our regiment has 
 been famous for avoiding service in ottawa 2008 saw a dramatic change in that dynamic with many long time ndhq 
 veterans being heard to exclaim where the hell did all these patricias come from as newly arrived patricias began adjusting 
 to ottawa culture shock caused in large part by the sight of lcol bob ford stalking around wearing a suit 
 and tie they were able to find some respite in the strong regimental links that exist throughout the national capital 
 region ncr in spite of diverse employment across the ncr with patricias serving in varied capacities from sofcom through to 
 the ceremonial guard and of course the association the family made time to get together and share special occasions most 
 poignantly ottawa area patricias supported our deployed troops and their families at repatriation ceremonies and funerals taking pride in the

 has a busy job to handover and there is a lot of preparation to do before deploying over here there 
 is still a lot of activity in the area even though the israeli defence force has pulled back from the

 on juno beach on 6 june 1944 leading a platoon of soldiers from c company of the first battalion the 
 canadian scottish regiment despite being wounded in his shoulder he led his men to their objective six miles inland and 
 earned himself his first military cross he returned to the regiment and was appointed acting captain before finding himself in 
 command of c company in the advance from normandy to the dutch border the battalion s attack across the leopold 
 canal was fiercely opposed and at 0300 hours on 7 october the germans launched a determined counterattack c company headquarters 
 found itself surrounded in a house from which they resisted enemy attacks for two and a half hours before being 
 forced to surrender before any opportunity arose to be freed the men from the canadian scottish were moved north to 
 the german divisional headquarters in oostburg for interrogation while being moved again by foot to a prisoner of war camp 
 in germany they were halted while waiting for a ferry a young dutch girl made her way to the crowd 
 with a basket of fruit captain schjelderup seized the opportunity to pass her a slip of paper with his name 
 and rank she was a member of the dutch underground and his information made its way to brigadier f n 
 cabeldu dso informing him that he was still alive following three days containment in a canal barge his wound sustained 
 during the attacks on leopold canal worsened the prisoners were moved to a train that ended up stalled in the 
 city of utrecht with 
 regimental monuments memorials 82 the patrician 2008 no food or blankets the prisoners conditions worsened yet again sergeant armando gri 
 had slid a penknife down his trousers and the men used this tool to carve an escape hatch in the 
 two inch thick walls using a pencil to cover the fresh carvings late on october 23 the train began to 
 move and the men kicked through their hatch in total ten men escaped from the car and split into small 
 groups before moving on captain schjelderup along with captain brownbridge and private trainor encountered three german obstacles before brownbridge was 
 eventually re captured captain schjelderup and private trainor found refuge at a farm selling black market milk the owners were 
 sympathetic and housed them while they contacted the dutch resistance the canadians were taken to isolated ruins where they were 
 interrogated to confirm the validity of their identification captain schjelderup ended up being housed with the leader of the resistance 
 hermannus raker due to his ailing medical state although in good hands he was diagnosed with pneumonia and a trained 
 nurse was finally brought in under the noses of the gestapo at one point the family was forced to discuss 
 how to dispose of his body however schjelderup s will to live prevailed on 23 december five other canadians including 
 sergeant gri were brought to the raker s residence to prepare to move to allied lines small groups of escapers 
 were moved to amerongen which was to act as a staging area on 2 january they moved to an abandoned 
 brickyard where 19 escapers were to meet a british patrol failing the arrival of the patrol at the designated time 
 the group decided to move on their own following the unfortunate encounter with a german patrol and then a german 
 machinegun 0:machine 0:gun position the group of escapers was soon separated captain schjelderup along with sergeant gri and a british 
 paratrooper private j hardy crept away from the german positions by moving along a frozen canal unfortunately the ice was 
 too thin and the three found themselves breaking through the ice with their fists in an effort reach a small 
 island where they huddled together through the cold night in an abandoned potato shed when dawn finally came they found 
 the germans occupying an occasional post only ten yards away after another cold night they moved late in the day 
 on 4 january after moving through the canal yet again they were faced with 600 yards of flooded land they 
 maneuvered their way across the semi frozen land and took shelter in an abandoned house where they were able to 
 make a fire and thaw the ice from their bodies and clothes once warm they planned their next move for 
 5 january with captain schjelderup leading sergeant gri followed by private hardy the three crept from the house and cautiously 
 moved along until they located another house that they deemed acceptable to attempt to enter they cautiously entered a house 
 where they were able to scrounge food to curb their days old hunger pains as they limped on private hardy 
 walked backwards respecting his spacing to guard the rear of the strange procession he often tripped over what he was 
 later told were trip flare wires and mines that had been frozen useless two pairs of eyes watched the trio 
 from a slit as they made there way down the road captain schjelderup and sergeant gri were allowed to pass 
 the outpost but private hardy was challenged sharply the trench belonged to members of the british 41st recce squadron and 
 the three escapees were escorted to battalion headquarters for questioning finally they received medical attention on the outskirts of nijmegen 
 it was for his courageous efforts during the escape that captain schjelderup was awarded the bar to the military cross

 patricia s canadian light infantry ppcli canada s quick response to world war one was due in part to the 
 wealthy and distinguished montreal businessman and captain of the royal highlanders of canada hamilton gault as a veteran of the 
 south african war gault remained personally involved with the canadian political responsibility to britain as part of the empire as 
 the climate of war overshadowed the international community in early august 1914 hamilton gault ventured by train to ottawa with 
 a proposal he would personally raise and equip a mounted unit of canadians for the imperial authorities the proposal was 
 set in front of colonel sam hughes the canadian minister of militia and defence colonel hughes was attracted to the 
 offer but thought that an infantry unit as opposed to cavalry would be more useful to britain lcol farquhar approached 
 the duke of connaught for permission to name the regiment after his daughter her royal highness princess patricia of connaught 
 princess patricia had already become a much admired figure in canada because of her appreciation of the country s vasl 
 wilderness and people the request was made to the princess who was delighted on august 6th 1914 the canadian government 
 provisionally accepted hamilton gault s offer authority for the regiment was granted on 10 august 1914 through a charter hi 
 embodied in a report of the committee of the privy council of canada to raise and equip an infantry battalion 
 as detailed in the charter hamiltor gault would contribute 100 000 to finance and equip the battalion with the remainder

 of money decided to sell the mountain and in 1913 the mountain passed into the hands of a british officer 
 brigadier andrew hamilton gault the mills and the sugar bushes had disappeared and the mountain village hummed along less loudly 
 this suited brigadier gault who loved and respected the mountain in its original state in 1947 brigadier hamilton gault decided 
 to build on the shore of lac hertel initially a modest cottage but eventually a veritable mansion he encouraged people 
 to fish in his lake to walk on the former sugar bush roads to go horseback riding and even to 
 go downhill skiing in 1950 following the trends of the time he permitted the creation of a downhill ski club 
 only hunting and cutting wood were forbidden bridadier gault did not even allow his caretaker to trap the raccoons that 
 were eating from his garbage pails in 1957 he started to build his folly a large stone house on the 
 shore of the lake once it was finished he lived there a mere three weeks before he died on 28 
 november 1958 the house named the gault hourse still exists today and is used as a reception hall in keeping 
 with brigadier gault s wishes mcgill university prepared a master plan to set a clear course for the management of

 memorial chapel at rma sandhurst has a very special place in the hearts of all those officers who serve or 
 have served in the british army the chapel you see today is actually the third to be built at sandhurst

 positioned at right angles to the present building the former altar and sanctuary can still be seen in the chapel 
 of remembrance side chapel whilst the original entrance was beneath the present organ in 1919 plans for the present chapel 
 were agreed and work began the new enlarged building was reconsecrated by the archbishop of canterbury in may 1921 although

 a war footing becoming an officer cadet training unit octu it was in january 1947 thai the former royal military 
 college and the royal military academy woolwich which had closed in 1939 were amalgamated as the royal military academy sandhurst

 the gift of a corps or regiment of a relative or of one of thousands of individuals the memorials range 
 from before 1914 covering wars and campaigns in south africa sudan burma afghanistan and india to the first and second 
 world wars and many subsequent campaigns in which the british army has been involved since 1945 since 1947 the motto 
 of serve to lead has been taught to and adopted by generations of officer cadets the memorials in this chapel 
 are evidence of how their forebears as well as more recent cadets have given their lives in service to their 
 country their regiments and their soldiers

 these men and at the same time that there should be books of remembrance for the nile expedition and the 
 south african war as well as for those who paid the ultimate sacrifice during the first and second world wars 
 thus the honour roll of those who died overseas since confederation is now complete

 a good turnout of members and guests our branch members are spread over a large area in s w ontario 
 from sarnia borden to peterbourgh with the majority in the niagara peninsula area this makes it a bit difficult to 
 hold regular meeting more often throughout the year but we still have a fair size membership recruiting is difficult as 
 our nearest regular forces bases are london borden and toronto this year we also voted in a new guard during 
 our agm which consist of george ledwon president mark fisher isl1 sl vice hub lalonde 2 nd vice elaine gillespie

 of him but he still manages to support our branch as much as possible sw ontario ladies ed macdonald has 
 been involved with the remembrance day school presentation for quite some time now as a result of his good efforts 
 the students of pine grove elementary school displayed a keen interest in our vets and as a result started with 
 the help of their teacher a fund raising program their very first task was to raise enough money to send 
 ed and his wife june back to korea on a trip so ed could revisit the sites he served at 
 the school decided to keep this fundraiser program going each year and the monies raised would be donated to one 
 of the veterans groups in the area designed to assist any veteran within that group with their needs under direction 
 from ed our branch was the recipient this year and received a cheque from the school for funds a little 
 over 600 00 the school fundraiser is a sports tournament challenging other local school to the event s w ontario 
 branch would like to thank ed macdonald and pine grove school for their generous offer we where also very fortunate 
 to have our submission for the student bursary approved and where able to send miss patricia johnson daughter of william

 the serving members as well as retired members association 
 the patrician 2008 128 the members unanimously agreed that while veterans were generally given due recognition during the year of 
 the veteran it now seems that we have since been once again ignored there was general agreement that the public 
 must continue to be reminded of the importance of the sacrifice and contribution that veterans make for the country and 
 other countries there was a similar discussion with similar feelings about the issue of the infamous pension clawback the branch 
 president brian furlong briefed the members on the ongoing initiatives relative to the vpp program the importance of the program 
 and its details in real work was explained by past president bill minnis who has been the sole branch program 
 representative since its inception the president called for volunteers to undergo the training as sponsored by the national executive of 
 the association in the spirit of true comradeship george forbes doug gallant murray melanson george springer and dave snowball volunteered

 nd annual frezenberg dinner which was held at the trade convention centre penticton bc another great success and again enjoyed 
 by all members and guests 113 members and guests sat down for dinner count once again lowered due to medical 
 appointments and timings we were pleased to have with us the colonel of the regiment larry gollner and his wife 
 christine the cor addressed the members and brought up to date on the regiment and our troops in afghanistan in 
 april of 2008 i received a letter from veteran affairs advising me that i had been chosen to represent princess 
 patricia s canadian light infantry as part of the official government of canada delegation which would travel to korea to 
 mark the 55 th anniversary of the korean war armistice for that i thank the regiment for selecting me the 
 good part of this is that veteran affairs authorized my linda to go with me we would depart 8 july 
 2008 and return 15 july 2008 we flew out aboard our rcaf airbus what a beautiful plane where they fed 
 us at least every two hours coming and going linda was amazed that she was served by an rcaf cwo 
 i assured her that infantry cwo s did not serve meals at least not in my time during our visit 
 we took part in the following ceremony at rok republic of korea national cemetery rok national war memorial and museum 
 
 ppcli warrant officers senior ncos club 130 the patrician 2008 rok observation post sang seung where i had a good 
 look of hill 355 little gibraltar and hill 227 the area where some heavy fighting took place in the canadian 
 area hill 227 most important to me as that was where during a d company raid on that feature night 
 of 10 11 december 1951 i ran into a bad tempered chinaman this is not a war story we were 
 just out on an evening walk in the end i got the better part of it which resulted in a 
 free walking stick from veteran affairs some years later i am happy to say that i did not run into 
 him on this trip ceremony of remembrance of canadian at canadian korean war memorial garden naechon ceremony of korean war 
 memorial to armed forces of the british commonwealth gapyeong visit punmunjeon depart to busan pusan sunrise ceremony ceremony at united 
 nations memorial cemetery in korea where five of my platoon rest i am pleased to say that we were looked 
 after like royalty by veteran affairs canada staff the air force staff and without question the south korean people who 
 without doubt have more than best feelings for canadians the hotels were 5 star with all their services including meals 
 and the reception by our ambassador lipman and our dva minister greg thompson a beautiful country today in comparison to 
 the mud pile and rat ranch i recall some 58 years ago my one suggestion would be to drop some 
 of the not required ie free loading politicians and others in the same bracket in order add more korea war 
 veterans my count was approximately 12 actual korea war veterans out of the hundreds they flew to korea for the 
 55 th anniversary too late now by the time the next dva pilgrimage comes up there will be no more 
 korea war veterans medically fit to go this applies to all dva pilgrimages
