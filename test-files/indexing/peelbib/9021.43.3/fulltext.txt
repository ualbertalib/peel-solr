 same poio clubs england alberta history summer 1995 little interest has generally been according to some historians polo was exhibited
 by historians in the realm of a traditional english sport and a wealthy polo has been played in alberta sports
 as a social phenomenon in the one at that yet surprisingly polo was history of canada especially the history not

 aspect of social fairly obscure but nowhere is polo noted history many local histories published as an old english sport

 where polo on sport as an aspect of organizational originated according to most estimates life in the city or town

 but most accounts suggest 1876 these little attention is paid to the adoption of officers imported the game to england
 a theoretical framework for the purposes where it became popular among cavalry of analyzing who played what sports and officers
 it is no coincidence that the why the book sport in early calgary game became popular with men who focuses
 its attention on athletics but like had an interest in horses 4 the urban histories it makes no serious attempt
 to analyze the social at the time of settlement in alberta po 1 o significance of sport rather it is
 a was not considered to be an old catalogue of what sports were popular established sport while many people and
 where they were played in calgary undoubtedly played the game with much when the author discusses polo he says passion
 in the first twenty or so years that with the influx of gentlemen that it was in england it probably
 did ranchers and the open prairie it was not have enough time to establish itself only natural for polo to
 be established in firmly as part of the cultural heritage of 1 southern alberta the gentry classes thus there is
 no reason to assume that just because a statements such as this one are predominant number of english people 71

 that polo is a universal the 20 th century polo would be played constituent of elite social status howard moreover
 there is no reason to believe palmer s works on alberta also indicate that in areas where ranching that wealthy
 englishmen and pastimes predominated that polo was an such as polo are necessarily linked exclusive sport that appealed only to
 the palmer notes that the transplanted wealthy ranchers l g thomas victorian lifestyle included questioned the exclusiveness of polo established

 has been played in alberta since some activities of the various social the middle of the l 880 s and
 while it ranks overlapped yet others such as continues to be played today in many polo and horse racing were
 largely the places such as calgary and grande amusements of the prosperous prairie it has done so with varying citizens
 degrees of appeal over the years during alberta history summer 1995 the l 890 s the popularity of the sport
 began to grow in small ranching communities to the south of calgary as well as in calgary the peak of
 polo s popularity in alberta occurred during the first decade and a half of the 20 th century when the
 sport became common in ranching communities throughout the southern part of the province matches were suspended during the years of
 the ‘ first world war but with the cessation of the fighting people were not long ‘ returning to their
 favourite sport it was played by both men and women during ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ the l 920 s
