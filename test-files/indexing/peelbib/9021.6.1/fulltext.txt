 james g macgregor at any time in any country the building of the canadian pacific railway would have been a
 great achievement its completion across the continent in 1885 by a small and relatively poor nation like the canada of
 that time was a near miracle its conception its financing and its construction could have been carried through only by
 men of the greatest courage fortitude and ruggedness the builders of the canadian pacific railway had these qualities so for
 that matter have the nation builders of today whether they be financiers engineers or cat skinners but today we have
 so far achieved our mastery over nature that our great engineering feats require much less physical hardship the section of
 the canadian pacific railway which was the most difficult to build was that through the unexplored mountains of alberta and
 british columbia before any track was laid years had to be spent in exploring and surveying the then unknown wilderness
 of the mountains this survey had to be conducted on foot or by using canoes packhorses and dogteams it took
 over ten years if today we wished to thrust a railway through equally forbidding and equally unknown mountain masses the
 survey work could be done in one year most of it from arm chairs aeroplanes would photograph and map the
 passes helicopters would deliver parties cf instrument men to the canyons and bulldozers would smash a road through the forests
 so that cat trains could bring in men and supplies the following extracts from the journal of one party which
 in 1875 made a reconnaissance survey over the continental divide serve to remind us of the ruggedness of the type
 of men who built the canadian pacific railway at that time the best route for the railroad was thought to
 be from winnipeg through battleford fort edmonton and the yellowhead pass to the coast all of which lay along what
 is essentially the same route now taken by the main line of the canadian national railway the choice of this
 route had advanced so far by 1876 that a telegraph line for the use of the construction crews had been
 built as far west as leduc this line was extended to fort edmonton and served that point for several years
 after is was abandoned because the railway was re routed through calgary and banff these extracts are from the narrative
 of e w jarvis who set out from fort george prince george british columbia to investigate a pass from the
 headwaters of the fraser river to those of the smoky river unfortunately the requirements of space have made it necessary
 to quote portions only of this fascinating report which in turn forms part of the report of the canadian pacific
 railway 1877 jarvis narrative follows mr macgrcgor is the popular past president of the society and author of land of
 twelve foot davis behold the shining mountains and blankets and beads the party consisted of three white or five inches
 of snow on the new and men three indians and three trains smooth ice and we made pretty long of
 dogs and the order of march marches but the snow began to get was as follows two men in front
 to deeper when we turned up the north break track or beat down the snow with branch of the fraser
 at the head of their snowshoes to make a road over which it was hoped that a pass through which
 the dogs could travel then the the mountains would be found three trains with a man driving each the north
 branch was the mcgregor river the lightest being placed first and which enters the fraser some eight miles west lastly
 hannington or myself alternately of hansard station the party paused at this bringing up the rear and making what point
 to readjust loads and as planned is called ‘ track survey of the route previously to send some men back
 to fort travelled the bearings were taken with george a pocket compass and the distance an early start was ordered
 and an measured by pacing forty paces to the early start was made for we all saw chain being found
 a good average on clearly that no time must be wasted if level ground or ice and this was con
 we were to get over an unknown and tinued the whole of the distance to lake apparently an unlimited distance
 on a st anne fifty miles above fort edmon known and very limited supply of proton the intense cold continued
 until visions all my work of road making the third week in january and camping was useless the heavy snow
 having sunk out under these circumstances had its the ice and covered it with slush comdrawbacks many were the frozen
 noses pletely obliterating the old track we and ears during the day s march but had to put four men
 ahead to make the then the exercise helped to keep us road the other four driving the six trains warm

 slow just before noon one day alec scarcely did more than burn the side went to the bank where a
 small rill turned towards it the other being made was dripping over a rock for a drink thus more susceptible

 up the south fork of of the river each taking a different the river the mouth of which we passed

 forks where three sides by high bare rocky peaks we camped on the 12 th february here between which the
 long clear blue line we rested a day and as the number of of the glaciers was painfully apparent the
 party might now be reduced there a return to camp was all that could be being a smaller amount of
 supplies to done evidently no pass this way and carry two of the indians and two of a long discussion
 over many pipes did the hired trains were sent back to fort not much help matters as hanington george both
 dogs and men felt the said ‘ we seem to have got to the back good of a day s

 any more exploration in jarvis travelled up the mcgregor until that direction we were certainly in the he reached the
 point where it is joined by heart of the mountains and would no its single large tributary the herrick he
 doubt have admired the magnificent decided to ascend this stream but as seen in the previous passage the party had
 to turn back got abreast of the dogs when it sheered to the mcgregor and then decided to ascend off
 to one side of a small sapling they it this river too turned out to be difficult running or rather
 rolling on the other and dangerous but jarvis followed it until the sapling bent and the impetus carhe reached the
 mouth of the tributary which ned the whole train out on it about 20 has since been named after hun

 counterbalancing the sled and at the foot of the mountain now called haning swaying up and down in most ludicrous

 of our them free and the river was reached camp at the ‘ forks when we came to a without
 further mishap more mighty canyon than any yet en the water had overflowed the ice in countered which necessitated a
 detour many places above the canyon and this of about three miles overland to avoid impeded our progress very much
 as the it in attempting at first to get through bottom of the sleds had to be scraped the canyon
 and thus avoid a portage every half mile to get rid of the slush through the woods we went over
 some sticking to them which would soon have very doubtful places at one of which turned to ice the sight
 of one small the rocks were overhanging to such a bit of clear glare ice was hailed with degree that
 hanington had to take off a shout even the dogs seemed to enter his snowshoes he going first and creep
 into our feelings and set off at a scamper along a ledge on hands and knees for to cross it
 but it was like a mirage in fifty yards while just beyond this a the desert only meant to deceive
 for fall not very lucidly described by an no sooner did the weight of the sled come indian as being
 ‘ high all the same one on it than in it went dogs and allstick put a stop to any
 chance of get the ice proving to be no more than a ting through the canyon returning quarter of an
 inch thick and probably along the ledge part of the snow slid only frozen the night before the water away
 but hanington successfully imi however was only a couple of feet deep tated a limpet clinging to the rock until
 so they were easily fished out again a pole was held out to support him the entrance to the pass
 is very past this somewhat dangerous spot in grand being guarded on either side by grasping the pole however he
 let go high pyramidical peaks towering two to one of his snowshoes which whirled three thousand feet above the valley
 and away down stream and was given up covered with perpetual snow to the for lost when a sudden turn
 of the eddy most prominent of these points we gave brought it to the surface near enough the name ‘
 mount ida and it was here to be fished out with the pole at the we saw one of the
 most magnificent of south end of the portage the descent to the many fine glaciers along the route the river
 was very steep and with only it could not have been less than a mile one driver to each train
 their downward long and five hundred feet thick at the course could not be confined to ordinary face while it
 was of such a transparent speed the usual method of ‘ putting blue that we could almost imagine seeon the
 brakes by turning the sled on ing the rocks underneath and through its side and sitting on the curved bow

 as of distant thunder was it i was hurled to one side and the whole heard and a mighty avalanche
 seen trai n we n t pell mell to the river for rolling down the mountain side just tunately without
 doing any more harm above us the masses of ice and rock than the breaking of a few traces but
 chasing one another and leaping from hanington devised a cunning plan and point to point as if playing some weird

 it gently sing the probability of its reaching us for a short distance when however which however was strenuously negahe
 let go to change the rope from one tive down came one huge boulder as tree to another it became
 unmanageable though making directly for us but being and the whole concern started on its turned aside by the trees
 as it crashed downward career promising a repetition through them plunged into the river a of my descent but scarcely
 had the sled chain in front of the dogs who appeared puzzled to account for its sudden arrival descend near
 that point with the dogs it was of limestone and about ten feet but they had eventually to come down
 in diameter we did not camp near that a place very nearly as steep where one spot of the sleds
 broke away from the driver finally the party crossed the pass to the and coming in violent contact with a
 log headwaters of the kakwa which is one of in its downward care e r made a sandwich of the
 unfortunate dog nearest the the major tributaries of the smoky river the sled and broke the ‘ nose or turned
 up smoky eventually flows within a few miles bow into a dozen pieces besides damagof the city of grande prairie
 and finally enters the peace at peace river the party s ing the harness this was our first troubles were
 still far from being over serious calamity but the dog excepted everything was set straight in a couple at the
 little stream issuing from of hours the poor animal was past all the east end of the lakes we took
 our care when the sled struck a trivial mcifirst drink of water flowing to the arctic dent like the death
 of a dog and es ocean and supposing we were at the pecially such mongrel curs as some of head
 of smoky river we christened the ours were would not affect one seriously peak which guards this end of the
 pass in a civilized community but it cast quite ‘ smoky peak the stream soon became a gloom over our
 little party and even large enough to travel on and with such the dogs looked at one another as who
 an evident down grade as to call forth should say it may be my turn next allusions to facilis descensu
 s averni and by inverse ratio the lower we got the but next day the old state of more our
 spirits rose the most curiously things returned and the snow soon noticeable fact was the rapid increase in reached its
 average depth of two and the size of the river which at the end a half feet making the walking
 terribly of the first day s travel on it was already heavy this told on the dogs who were a
 couple of chains wide and this with getting tired out with their incessant out the visible addition of any branches
 hard work and we had frequently to which would help to swell the volume of leave the sleds standing and
 the whole its waters early the second morning six go ahead to break track then three we met with a
 check hanington and i return to bring on the trains and still were ahead when on turning a sharp find
 the snow so soft even after the bend in the river an immense abyss passage of nine pairs of snowshoes
 that yawned before us and we stood on the the poor animals would wallow through very edge of a fall
 which proved to be it up to their bodies it soon became two hundred and ten feet high and over
 evident this sort of thing could not last which had the morning been at all much longer it was beginning
 to tell misty we would probably have walked on the men as well as the dogs and there was no
 sound of falling water to another cause for uneasiness suggested give warning of the dangerous proximity itself ‘ what if
 this be not smoky river and it afterwards appeared when look at all but some other branch of peace ing
 up from below that the whole party river which will take us away goodhad been standing on what was merely
 ness knows where if we follow it for a projecting cake of ice and snow not we knew by our
 latitude obtained by more than a couple of feet thick observation and our approximate longitude calculated by dead reckoning from
 the left bank appeared most favor the track survey we were making that able to make a portage on and
 we had our course to strike the athabasca river to go back a short distance to climb the and the
 country we wished to explore hill on that side i took the first oppor between it and the saskatchewan river
 tunity of descending again to the valley would be about south east while we of the river sitting as usual
 on the heels were now travelling at right angles to of my snowshoes but taking some rather this course or
 north east i could not ugly and unforeseen jumps over sundry however abandon the hope of the river little bluffs
 near the bottom and finally shortly turning to the east or even more landing minus mitts and cap full length
 in the desired direction so we held on in the open water fortunately only about a few days longer but
 scarcely a day a foot deep the others continued the passed when the dismal howl of the portage farther as
 it was impossible to dogs did not announce to our unwilling ears that another of their number had packs and
 divided among the dogs who dropped exhausted in his tracks and it would surely be able to get along with
 soon became very evident that we must these small loads not more than fifteen put our best foot foremost in
 order to get pounds apiece the following day we through with safety to ourselves started early and by this must
 be under at camp this night we saw a number stood a couple of hours before sunrise of old indian
 lodges and marks of a our usual time for departure from camp horse trail having been cut through the being
 as soon as we could see to put one woods this encouraged us to think we foot before the other
 which necessitated were on smoky river as alec knew the rising at four o clock every morning jasper valley indians
 had a trail by throughout the whole winter which they go in summer to it but in after travelling down
 the kakwa a tribuwinter we cannot find sure proof that tary of the smoky for some distance jarvis it is
 a trail of pack animals a long decided to strike out across the foothill and earnest consultation in which three
 country in the hope of reaching the athabasca different propositions were made first river before everyone in the party starved
 to assume we are on smoky river and the country was very broken to follow it to peace river and
 fort and consisted principally of long high dunvegan second to go east to fort ridges crossing our course at right
 assiniboine on the athabasca and angles and covered with small pine of third to go south west to jasper house
 second growth the frequent ‘ ups and ended in the adoption of the latter and downs were hard on the
 poor dogs who the following day finding the river were very weak and fell exhausted turned still more to the
 north orders daily in order to spare them any more were given to camp early and a suit suffering the
 stragglers received a able place chosen to build a cache in coup de grace from one of our revolvers which
 to leave everything that could and the others ‘ closing up continued possibly be spared going ahead a the march
 only howling a requiem over couple of miles to look for a good place their dead companions round the camp
 to leave the river we came across a at night from the top of one of the very old and
 indistinct snowshoe track highest ridges a perfect ‘ hog s back coming down on the river and after half we
 caught sight of a deep valley at our a mile leaving it again but without the feet and the rockies
 fifty miles away least vestige of a track in the woods to the south this must be the atha this
 part of the country is evidently not basca and we hastened down eager to much visited in winter the scarcity
 of reach a known point but only to be game would account for this for we disappointed for it turned
 out to be a have seen absolutely nothing since leav vast muskeg nearly treeless and from ing the mountains we

 other way soon which will be a next day the 5 th march we re sort of guide to us
 near camp tonight mained in camp to take a much needed i found signs of a trail a few trees
 rest and to make various repairs i having been blazed but it did not appear determined if possible to take
 one train to run in the right direction for us to jasper house and alec s was selected another high
 ridge loomed up in for that purpose the other two sleds and front and surmounting it after much their harness
 together with superfluous hard climbing traces of the trail were clothing and instruments were placed again found with old indian
 camps and in a small log hut six feet by four and the head waters of a river running to
 three feet high built for the purpose the south east surely we were now and the names and date marked
 on sur approaching the athabasca we plucked rounding trees knowing the extreme up heart and made a good day s
 march difficulty of getting a loaded train but the blazes at first easy to follow through the woods each one
 was to carry became indistinct and finally lost before his blankets and share of the provisions night and when orders
 were given to while the salmon were made into little camp hanington and i started off in different directions to
 look for them leav he was left to his fate not without many ing alec and the indians to make
 the regrets by this time we expected to have camp on my return i found the indians been near the
 mountains seen some days in a mournful state of despair declaring ago and possibly may have been but they were
 lost and would never see their a thick mist shrouded everything for a homes again and weeping bitterly it couple
 of days and we groped along took a great deal of persuasion to set almost in darkness but one bright
 mornthem on their legs again and had there ing the rising sun dispelled the mist been any possibility of their
 running and from an elevated and burnt side away there is but little doubt that their hill on which we
 were travelling alec fears were so worked upon that they caught sight of a to him well known would soon
 have availed themselves of feature in the landscape the ‘ roche a it but they knew their only chance of
 miette whose peculiar and distinct procoming through in safety lay in remain file was plainly visible about twentying with the
 party and they submitted five miles south of us this mountain to our arguments though we found it is opposite
 jasper house at the eastern somewhat difficult to use persuasive end of the yellow head pass and the eloquence where
 we were not quite sure sight of it was an immense relief to the of the soundess of our own
 reasoning minds of the leaders of the party since the river as usual began to turn off it was from
 the hudson s bay company s to the north east so we decided to leave post there that we expected
 shelter and it and follow the old south east course supplies the latter having now reached which has so far
 led us into no great very small proportions difficulties the dogs decreased rapidly the packs were thrown off in the

 the cariboo dogs called the feeling of security after the ‘ buster probably a contraction of fili anxieties of the
 past month was too buster could not be coaxed away from pleasant to be rudely disturbed and the camp fire
 this morning but no one even the stolid countenances of the had the heart to put an end to him
 so indians lighted up at the thought of a after wandering through the wilderness north of the athabasca river the
 jarvis party was relieved to see the prominent roche miette on the southern horizon this mountain is immediately south of
 the present pocahontas station at the entrance to jasper national park the above photo is from the mcdermid studio collection

 deer s meat and as there another look at the ‘ roche by moonlight was no immediate prospect of starvation
 to assure himself that he was not mis a halt was ordered for the day i and taken the bare
 possibility of such a one of the indians rode up to jasper thing alarmed us and the evening did house

 athabasca nothing at the store but a little powder in this hole at our feet we might as and shot

 by g edmund kelly now having reached the age of three score and ten i believe it right and proper
 that i should leave some record of your forefathers and the part my father in particular took in the early
 development of this province it is true his part was modest but for that matter so was the part played
 by most of these pioneers but it was the combined efforts of these men and women who paved the way
 for the success of the present generation many of the settlers who came to edmonton and vicinity in the early
 1880 s were from glengarry county in ontario and were of scotch and irish extraction some of the names were
 duggan mccrae cust donovan kennedy macdonald mcnab macarthur cameron kelly and others there is a school district north and west
 of edmonton called glengarry a name given to this district by some of these early settlers from glengarry county it
 is impossible for me to give you highland jacobite clan which at the the history of all these people as
 a time of the american revolution reyoungster most of them were well known mained loyal and left johnstown in new
 to me and their descendants no doubt york state and came to canada are still living around here however there
 were ten children in william through the rapid growth of this province kelly s family five boys and five girls
 their identity has been lost and for this my father john edmund kelly was the reason i must restrict this
 article to the eldest of the boys after the death of history of my immediate family their their father in
 a lumbering accident history probably differs little from the eight of these children with their mother history of these other
 pioneer families came to edmonton this was not the in those days there was no benevo first trip west for
 my father nor for one lent government to assist immigrants of his brothers luke kelly support them until they were
 settled or father was a steam engineer by proif they found life too hard or primitive fession and in 1877

 as it has street where they resided for the rest today old man monroe s adventure this story was told
 to john iv hannay by hugh monroe and was published in the ben ton river press montana dec 28 1881
 monroe was born in montreal in 1784 and went to fort edmonton in about 1802 three years later he married
 a peigan woman forsook civilization and lived with that tribe until his death in 1892 at 108 years of age
 near bear s head i was behind the moving band of piegans with an iroquois indian and a young lad
 who was fond of me i had been informed that the mosquito clan were suspicious of the iroquois they had
 often asked me about him where he came from what he wanted and all such questions i tried to quiet
 their suspicions by saying that he was an old friend of mine but it was to no good and i
 had fallen behind the tribe this day in order to warn the iroquois that he had better get away from
 the party these mosquitoes were soldiers they had eagle claws on their wrists and a bow with three arrows all
 painted red they kept order on the march not allowing any straggling in doing this they would attack anybody woman
 or child with these claws often making ugly wounds if resisted they would kill the persons who opposed them they
 were very fierce and were called mosquitoes because they attacked anything big or little whilst behind the column i suddenly
 saw a cloud of dust and thought that the mosquitoes were pursuing somone in the main body but seeing that
 the dust advanced in our direction and was soon past the end of the train of lodge poles i became
 aware that they were after us presently bad chief who was chief of a band of these mosquitoes and who
 had killed a relative of my father in law rising head rode up to me at full speed and tried
 to strike me with the claws on his wrists so i hit his horse across the head with my whip
 and it ran away with him i then whipped up my pony and overtook the pack train just as i
 reached it bad chief at the head of fifteen or sixteen of his soldiers made a rush at me i
 tried to seek a place of safety among the pack animals but they were so huddled together that i could
 not in a second bad chief who had outridden his men was by my side trying to get at me
 with his coup stick i had no time to lose in making my escape so i made a back handed
 stroke at his horse with my whip but i missed the beast and struck my enemy across the face as
 quick as lightning he placed an arrow in his bow and aimed straight at my heart but he pulled the
 string with such violence that it broke in his hand his soldiers were now swarming around me and frantic with
 fear i dashed again amongst the pack animals knocking some down and jumping over the lodge poles until i found
 my way to the other side of the column i stopped here to examine the priming of my gun which
 to my dismay i found had fallen out whilst i was doing this a mosquito whom i had not before
 seen attacked me and whipped my horse across the face with such force that the beast reared and fell over
 backward throwing me to the ground i was no sooner down than i was covered with a swarm of mosquitoes
 some of whom were trying to shield me from those who were hacking at me with their claws whilst bad
 chief was struggling to get near enough to kill me fortunately a head chief called the man who had plenty
 of horses heard the disturbance and coming to my assistance he drew his knife threw himself upon my assailants and
 saved my life our town was gangling and our province new by eula carscallen lapp the day i started life
 in red deer it was still in the north west territories a few weeks later the province of alberta was
 born some of my father s waggish friends suggested he name his new daughter autonomy an exciting word on everyone
 s tongue at the time fortunately my father was reading a dime novel and decided on the heroine s name
 for the new baby it was a slight improvement over autonomy my parents had been building a i d have
 answered indignantly why bungalow on mann street and i tact in the hospital of course where else lessly arrived the
 night of the day they would babies be born in any civilized moved in my father pulled on his town
 clothes in the small hours and ran down to dr parson s house by the plank side when i started
 to the big stone central walk across the swamp he roused the school i paid no attention to its newness
 doctor and helped him hitch his team yet one could write the history of school then they hurried my mother
 to the new ing in our community to that time in one hospital on the south west hill sentence our
 school completed in 1907 my father must have felt relief that replaced the two room school built in the little
 thirteen bed hospital was ready 1894 which had replaced the one room when his wife needed it he well knew
 school built in 1886 when the log school how much planning and effort had gone had opened there had been
 seven pupils into the project in the last three years but it had been the sixth governmenthe was secretary treasurer
 of the board controlled school in alberta and was lord strathcona had given one thousand known as the red deer
 central prodollars to the hamlet of red deer in 1902 testant public school district no 104 of the north west
 territories in memory of four local boys who fell in the boer war what better memorial the new stone school
 which i attended than a hospital the first in the two had cost 36 000 in 1912 there were hundred
 mile stretch between calgary 420 pupils and steps already were being and edmonton all the young men in taken to
 open a second school in the town had reached down into their town scantily filled pockets and had raised the
 balance necessary to build a small as we played hopscotch or immies hospital we children never thought how recently the
 hospital must have been a matter the buffalo had overrun our play of satisfaction to the doctor too as he
 grounds yet some time in the 8 0 s hurried his indian ponies up the long david mcdougall one of
 the pioneer hill that summer night in 1905 with missionary family wrote of a trip his friend stan and his
 young wife from through the fled deer district and said forest ontario about to have her first when i reached
 what is now central school grounds the buffalo herd was so baby dense that i was obliged to get down
 no one ever told me i was one of from by buckboard several times to lift the first babies born
 in the red deer the calves from my pathway even memorial hospital no plaque either allowing for some poetic licence
 this and if anyone ever asked me when i story suggests how recently our school was six or thereabouts where
 my little grounds had been claimed for the funcbrother and sister were born i m sure tjons of civilization mrs
 lapp is now a resident of meal ord ontario central school in red deer was built iii 1907 and officially
 opened on october 10 th by premier a c rutherford hon w h cushing and hon c w cross this
 building is still in use as an elementary school when as a small girl i was sent friendly store keeper
 who one day downtown to buy a spool of thread or would become a kind of institution and a hair
 ribbon i never pondered that the often be called the father of red deer man who served me ray gaetz
 by he was of course a son of rev leonard name had kept store not long before gaetz his eldest
 son in a log trading post with only indians the handsome brick methodist church for customers in fact i don
 t recall any as far as i was concerned just beone ever telling me about that trading longed on sunday
 mornings when i post i don t blame my parents they was old enough i walked to church with were
 too busy with present struggles my father who always gave me a feelmaking a home and sharing in a com
 ing that walking to church was a special munity with growing pains to bother and happy ritual the rhythmic jaunty
 relating the brief history of the district swing of his cane his dapper appearance to their children still i wish
 someone and good humour were all part of a had told me some of the stories about sense of well
 being which he radiated ray gaetz and the trading post take as we swung along in the alberta sunthat one
 about the new year s day when shine or the nippy frost perhaps it was he was eighteen and had
 to use his wits a young man s exhilaration at the chalto get rid of twenty five grinning squaws lenge
 of life in a new country anywho flocked into the post together and way sundays seemed like celebrations hung around
 looking sheepish young to one child and when my brother and ray just out from the east had to learn
 sister were old enough the whole family about kissing day when the white all shined and starched and father so
 trader was expected to kiss every squaw help me wearing striped pants and a who called on the first day
 of the year cutaway coat in the very early years ray hit on the idea when he began to swung
 along smiling at neighbours feel really desperate of feeding the also on their way to service in the indian women
 hardtack and treacle in anglican presbyterian baptist or methostead of kisses and with the door open dist church he triumphantly
 handed each a departing gift of a bag of candy the methodist sanctuary was dedicated in 1909 and named the
 leonard but i never heard that story and gaetz memorial methodist church the others until i read annie gaetz book
 gaetz family presented the pipe organ and old copies of the red deer advocate in memory of their mother last
 year recently all i knew as a youngster was i was saddened to read that this fine that the children
 liked this gentle building so full of memories for early families had burned to the ground it us that our
 father won prizes for his is now being replaced by a modern white wyandotte roosters but we cerchurch which the
 next generation of tainly were impressed with alma the bed deer youngsters will no doubt take fat lady on the
 midway to this day for granted too any woman with arms like bulging the leonard gaetz church was not sausages
 reminds me of my fascinated the first methodist one there had been revulsion on first seeing alma at the an
 earlier one erected by bees when red deer fair my sister and i had all the men whatever their religious
 a once in a lifetime experience when the affiliation had helped but the majority ferris wheel broke down and we
 were of early settlers had been methodists the only passengers we were quite when they built their first church the
 happily marooned for forty minutes at population was 125 still i have no the twelve o clock position on the
 giant recollection of anyone telling me that wheel of course we knew that in any walter code s grist mill
 was once the civilized town like ours the fair came methodist church round every year of course we children knew
 where naturally we girls never considered rev leonard gaetz had lived and his ourselves lucky to have good piano lesfamily
 still lived dr gaetz died just sons but we did have from madame before the new church was finished le
 saunier or miss ceba michener the family residence was a big frame known as aunt ceby to many of use
 house by the river but i only discovered we played at recitals in the parish hall recently that his house
 built in 1890 of the anglican church clad in our sunand still a fine residence on the high day best
 embroidered white dresses way from calgary to edmonton had with blue or pink sashes or later pastel been the first

 wood fled hundred dollars to send adolescent boys deer s nature writer we had picnics to england phil and don
 had found in another park called you guessed it a man sleeping near the entrance to gaetz park and my
 parents worked on the fair grounds a man who had shot church and civic committees with many and seriously wounded

 was delivered tion was a reward for their alertness by a gaetz from cans on a wagon and in apprehending
 this thug poured through a funnel into the jugs the new empress theatre was opened carried out by waiting housewives
 before i was eight earlier there had since the horticultural society was been what was pretentiously called the the first
 organization in red deer it opera house where pauline johnson had seems only natural that we should have appeared in
 person in 1905 other ciihad early fairs of course after the first tractions had included the mikado one in 1911
 we children accepted these and something called the blackest coon nonchalantly too it didn t register with from georgia but
 by 1913 we children were going to the pictures about once one of these caravan trips to the lake a
 week to see mary miles minter and it shows three cars stopped in the ruts mary pickford or pearl white
 the hat on the muddy road one car belonging ter always left dangling precariously to our nearest neighbor seems to
 be over a cliff at the end of the saturday stuck fast two men one my fatherserial have their coats
 off and their sleeves the next year 1914 our proud little rolled up working to extricate the mired town had
 the third public library in al car while the owner stands calmly by berta that it materialized was due to
 watching trim as usual in his business the combined efforts of the district in suit maybe since he was a
 lawyer spector of schools the young men s club he was giving orderly advice to his of the methodist church
 the board of sweating neighbors i don t know but trade and the horticultural society of course he had a
 good deal of friendly in my early teens my friends and i made teasing when this snapshot was passed regular
 pilgrimages to the little library around in the town hall for books by such in the end the lawyer s
 family sufwriters as jeffrey farnol and gene strat fered more than any of us from the ton porter partly to
 that little library treachery of those early roads for in with its pretty young librarian named 1922 his eldest son
 in his early teens ina greene i owe nearly forty years lost his life in a freak car accident he
 of happy trips to the library but in was my brother s best friend and his those days i never
 thought of being death shocked us all greatly the boys grateful for it nor was i aware that my had
 been on their way with a school father was on the first library board baseball team to the little town
 of penhold to play against their school team each summer from the time i was two the roads were bad
 and on a sudden we went to sylvan lake fifteen miles lurch of the car this lad fell forward west
 i had no idea that until 1903 the baseball bat which he was holdthis lovely spot had been called snake
 ing between his knees punctured his lake just as well i might never have abdomen he died soon afterwards learned
 to swim poor roads were among the worst the road to the lake was so hazards in our part as
 in all new hazardous that no family ever considered western settlements and this family setting out alone we went in
 a con always for me will represent those who voy the better to pull each other out suffered most from
 their treachery of the mud as soon as the snow was at sylvan lake my father built one gone in
 the spring we children began of the first cottages it was two miles an urgent agitation to go to the
 lake from the present prosperous town at mother would say as soon as that mud what was called lower camp
 the cotpuddle is dried up every spring on tage was not much more than a shack the road at the
 west side of our house to which rooms were added later but there was a whopper mud puddle the we
 children had a wonderful time there theory was that when it was dry there at first the cottage was perched
 up on was at least a chance that the road to large vertical logs and once in a big the
 lake would be passable once the wind storm it blew crooked on the lot neighborhood kids decided to lend us
 but not off the logs after that disaster and nature a hand we worked like my mother named it squewgee
 slaves a whole morning with pint sized which at least was more original than pails and kitchen spoons but i
 can t some cottage names recall whether we got to the lake any when we were old enough we children
 sooner for our efforts or were just walked the four miles to the village and scolded for being smeared with
 mud back each day for mail groceries and when we started driving in cars to the inevitable banana split from
 the local sylvan rather than going behind a team soda fountain but we never once talked of ponies it was
 routine for my father about how recently we whites had taken to throw a spade in the back seat and
 the lake from the indians not even put the chains on the tires when an indian family who had lived
 in an àld 0:ald family album we have an there for years drove by in a buggy amusing candid camera shot
 taken on and cast stolid glances in our direction a british bride to be comes to calgary by mrs ernest
 g may and tow us into port no wireless in those days about 1 30 a m saturday i heard
 a noise on deck and was told by the steward that there was another ship close by that had answered
 our signals my companion in the next berth and i later corners no doubt will often wonder what were the
 first impressions of a tenderfoot on entering this new country when it was new in every sense of the word
 therefore i will endeavour in a small way to give a few of my own my home had always been
 in berkshire england but the family moved to ramsgate later for the benefit of my father s health it was
 from the station of this seaside resort that i started on my life s great journey may 16 th 1888
 my father accompanying me as far as liverpool where we stayed that night the 17 th was a perfect summer
 may day and about mid day we were taken in a tender aboard the s s sardinian of the allan
 line where my father placed me under the captain s care who in turn transferred me to the chief officer
 alec stewart for the voyage my father s idea was to come to canada in about a year s time
 to visit us after we had got settled down but he died not long after i left england there were
 four other young girls salon passengers and about one hundred others besides a newly married couple with their nephew harry
 scott with whom i eventually travelled as far as winnipeg everything was very comfortable on the ship the first part
 of the voyage was very rough unusually so and we were enjoying what was about the first fine afternoon on
 deck may 24 th when all at once there was a tremendous shaking all over the ship accompanied by a
 grating noise this caused con mrs may nee eliza mary puke was like many pioneer british women whose future husbands
 came to canada to establish a home before send ing for them this photo was taken in 1885 in reading
 england quickly dressed and went on deck we were in time to see a boat lowered and our captain taken
 over to hold a confab with the captain of the other vessel which turned out to be the elbe of
 the north german lloyd line a mail boat with four masts and two funnels and lighted by electricity she looked
 fine at night the little boat manned by the sailors carrying a big lighted torch also looked very picturesque our
 capsternation among the passengers as some thought we had run upon ice however we were informed that the propeller had
 snapped right off there was nothing to do but drift about where we were until another ship should sight us
 this interesting reminiscence was written by mrs may nee eliza mary paice three months before her death in 1929 it
 is reproduced here with the kind permission of her son r c may of bragg creek and the glen bow
 foundation calgary tam returned without being able to come way but we reached quebec about six to terms and we
 retired once more to o clock this being mr woodley s our berths during the day we read and second
 trip west taking out a bride this played games until about 4 p m the time he knew the ropes
 so he his wife same day when another steamer the and nephew a mr scott and myself norseman of the
 warren line came to all went to henchey s hotel opposite us and she eventually towed us into the english
 cathedral on saturday as halifax harbour after our having been the luggage had not come we just looked adrift for
 two days around and put in time we had church service on the boat quebec was a very quaint old
 city on sunday morning and sacred music with a few fine buildings some of stone in the evening on monday
 the weather but most of them of wood the streets was lovely and the sea calm making were very dirty
 but the whole place up for the terrible weather we had had was most interesting on sunday we we saw
 several whales sharks and an went to the service at the cathedral in iceberg or two wednesday we landed the
 morning and for a nice walk to the in halifax about 5 am it was a dirty citadel in the
 afternoon a soldier looking place buildings mostly of wood showed us the place where general my luggage was in the
 ship s hold so wolfe was killed and also took us round i had to stay near i had breakfast
 and the parliament buildings the soldiers then the chief officer mr stewart in kept a bear and a buffalo at
 the citadel whose care i had been placed kindly as pets of the army after service at helped me to
 find it we saw it through the cathedral in the evening we walked the customs and then i got my
 railway along the esplanade which reminded me ticket and luggage checked somewhat of brighton only this promen it was at
 once impressed with the good ade was situated very high up and from system prevailing in this country where it
 one could obtain a splendid view of a brass tag with a number on is fastened the harbour point levis

 me bine growing on the rocks of course this off on the train there were about ten is a garden
 flower in england we left salon passengers and we all went into quebec about 3 p m but even then
 my a pullman sleeping car at night the luggage had not reached the station seats were turned over and arranged
 into in time all my goods and chattels berths as on board ship and were quite treasures and otherwise to
 say nothing comfortable in the morning i felt some of a large wedding cake at last we thing pulling at
 the bed clothes and were in the train and on our way to the heard a voice saying it was
 time to get great west i noticed some of our travelup for breakfast it was 5 am the voice ling
 companions of the boat were on was that of the sleeping car porter i board but not many dressed and
 in half an hour we got out i really think that the railway journey at moncton station or depot as
 i found was the most trying part of the whole it was called here i had breakfast trip although the
 first half as far as which was made up of some very tough winnipeg was more interesting than the beef
 steak bread and butter and i then latter half being varied and picturesque returned to the car with huge hills
 covered with spruce i was very glad to make friends with trees beautiful woods and lakes then a mr and
 mrs woodley as they were came vast prairies broken at very rare going through to winnipeg the scenery intervals by
 a group of wooden houses from halifax was very diversified being connected by a long platform these rough and hilly
 with trees and water were stations at each of them there was falls occasionally there would be a usually a
 small gathering of people group of wooden houses with one hotel sometimes a few indians congregated prominent in their midst
 forming a vil there to see the event of the day the lage the engine broke down on the daily
 train passing through and to sell their goods buffalo horns beadwork etc i have not mentioned that one could walk
 inside the whole length of the train i noticed that there was very little land cultivated and very few homes
 erected on these vast prairies but time no doubt would remedy that i should mention that wednesday of that week
 was to have been my wedding day but owing to the delay caused by the accident on board ship the
 ceremony had to be postponed we had now come to friday evening june 8 th and i was told that
 we would reach calgary which was my destination before long darkness fell over the land and it must have been
 well into the middle of the night before the train slowed down and i heard that welcome name shouted out
 in a few seconds more i heard the still more welcome sound of the voice of my future husband ernest
 g may who had come out two years before in 1886 to prepare a home for us ernest took me
 to the royal hotel the usual rendezvous of the brides of those days and after seeing that i was comfortable
 repaired to his home for the night my fiance s brother edward was already out here also his cousin w
 h boorne and next morning after meeting them and some very kind friends mr and mrs e molony ernest showed
 me round the town it was about what i had expected there was one main street called stephen avenue which
 consisted of small wooden stores which extended east and west from the royal hotel scattered round from this street were
 private dwellings all built of wood that impressed me more than anything as i wondered in a country like this
 where so much heat is required in the winter how it was that most of these houses were not consumed
 by fire however i learned from experience then i was struck by the absence of trees and it seemed to
 me there were very few birds the n w m police barracks which were at the east end of the
 town seemed the one sign that there was a government here our interest was kept up in the personnel of
 the police by seeing them attend church parade the first sunday of every month on sunday we attended service in
 the little wooden english church presided over by the rev a w f cooper a very nice clergyman who married
 us the next day the organist of those days a mr dyer was a gentleman who should not be forgotten
 for he was at his post regularly every sunday fair weather or foul and nobody but himself knew what he
 endured driving in from fifteen miles west in the bitterest of weather mr and mrs molony kindly entertained us to
 dinner and supper another friend ernest introduced me to was jack innes who was the first man to operate the
 little switchboard no larger than a small table when the telephone was first brought to calgary he was quite an
 artist and in partnership with george fraser used to design and make cuts or illustrations for the paper for commercial
 purposes in later years he was known as one of canada foremost painters especially of western subjects which he was
 so well qualified to depict he was a son of canon innes of london ontario on monday june 11 th
 1888 my lug gage arrived and we unpacked my wed the marriage of eliza paice and ernest may took place
 in this little anglican church in calgary it was located on the north east corner of 7 th ave and
 1 st st east at the site of the present church of the redeemer this photo was taken by boorne

 we were wed mr friends mr and mrs harry widdi molony gave me away mrs molony combe who lived up
 the elbow river was my bridesmaid and hanson boorne and we decided that we would like to best man edward

 land about ten miles innes were present we had supper at west of calgary on the north side of mr
 molony s and a week later had our the elbow river it was a lovely spot real wedding repast when
 the cake lots of trees with a creek running through and other things had been unpacked it and a splendid
 view of the rockies later on in the evening we went for a it was one of the nicest little
 ranges in long walk west by the bow river which the country a part of the lower land was in
 those days lined on the south was a favorite camping ground of the side by large cottonwood trees and then
 indians the cutbank just above there home to ernest s shack which con running into a v shape where they
 used sisted of two rooms and a tiny kitchen to run the buffalo over to kill them a built on
 section 16 near where what large heap of their skulls and bones rewas later known as the bowrnarsh mained there
 for many years after in bridge october 1889 my husband and his my husband was in business with his youngest
 brother edward went to the cousin w h boorne when i first came ranch and camped while they built a

 ernest took a week s holiday which the place in england where my husband we spent unpacking my numerous trunks
 was born and boxes and making the little shack we were much bothered with range look homelike and comfortable we
 spent cattle round the house as there were no our honeymoon about three months later fences in those days sometimes

 also that of the indians of the west i shall in future confine myself to the district and in later
 years the provinceof alberta in which it might be truthfully said the opening of the whole west took place the
 province of alberta created as such in 1905 covers an immense and diversified area being from north to south 750
 miles while the width varies from four hundred to four hundred and fifty miles its total area is 255 585
 square miles it is within a few hundred square miles as large as the combined areas of montana north dakota
 and minnesota and is over twice the area of great britain and ireland together this vast and fertile country has
 been from time immemorial the pasture of wild game of many varieties and inhabited by thousands of indians of different
 tribes back to the time when the french and english companies in the early wars of the seventeenth century contended
 with each other for the furs gathered by the north american indians traders had been among them strong stone forts
 were built by them along the shores of the hudson bay not so much for protec sir cecil denny tion
