 country between about 1900 and 1930 alberta s popu the government of alberta was faced with the lation increased from
 about 70 000 to morn than formidable task of transfonning the ethnically and 700 000 with a large percentage of
 the linguistically diverse immigrant population into immigrants arriving from countries where a language other than english was spoken dr manfred
 is a professor in the department of germanic languages university of alberta consequently they knew little or no english and
 edmonton he has recently completed a book length with their culture they brought along their old manuscript entitled german in
 alberta maintenance ways of thinking and behaving and sometimes and teaching above is a classroom of immigrant children at bruderheim
 in 1915 their old prejudices as well they were familiar loyal and true canadians there was a general and to
 stimulate his desire for it we must consensus among politicians and the population ask our newer settlers and our alien
 born at large that the newcomers must abandon their settlers to allow us interpreters messengers in their communities we cannot
 reach them by our linguistic and cultural heritage in favour of the conversation our newspapers and many of our language
 and the social values of their new institutions we endeavor to reach them by our homeland permitting the immigrants to
 retain schools and to offer their children the entree to their identity openly was politically unacceptable a modern world where
 doors are only half open instead their canadianization was to be achieved for parents who have never had the chance
 of making terms with its spirit and speech 6 by teaching them the english language so that they could participate
 in the affairs of the country and by 1929 when engla nd s book was published by teaching them to
 think and behave like the experiment had succeeded admirably at canadians least from the government s point of view among
 in reviewing the policy of canadianization in the immigrants from austro hungaty for the west since the beginning of the
 century instance 46 per cent of the females and 26 per robert england in 1929 likened the process to a
 cent of the males had been unable to speak english tremendous experiment in social engineering in 1916 by 1931 a
 mere fraction of one percent there is no experiment in the british empire like of the same population group spoke
 only their it nor is there one that will test so severely and mother tongue according to census data even
 perhaps even endanger our british ideals and among the foreign born albertans of austrothose things we love our standanl of

 into a melting pot rat her and 10 percent of the men could not speak different from that which we
 have perhaps too english superficially envisaged can canada mould her how had this remarkable feat of linguistic new found sons
 to a size commensurate with the assimilation been accomplished in addition to the country s scale and opportunities if not
 the effects of intercultural contact between the land of t heir fat hers will it become for them the land
 of their sons 2 immigrant and the dominant anglophone society to robert england language was the main anglicization resulted from
 the schools role in pr oblem the main barrier between canadians and implementing government policy the reconis of new immigrants
 and he believed that it the alberta department of education support the accentuated racial and cultural differences and view that
 the elementary school in alberta caused conflicts similar to those in europe where especially in the rural areas where the
 majority the languages separated the peoples of the immigrants had settled played a major role in the linguistic and sociocultural
 assimilation of first and foremost there is the necessity of securing a common language which will make immigrants to alberta
 in the first third of the cenunderstanding possible between the various races tury it should be noted that this policy
 was not the question is not one of the merits of unique to alberta other pr ovinces faced similar bilingualism
 but lies rather in the urgency of problems and employed similar solutions securing for each child and adequate knowledge the
 government s policy was characterized by of the language which the majority of the people on the north american continent
 speak 3 two main hrusts immigrant children rather than adults were to be the target of the canadianiza the teaching
 of english is an essential part of the programme of nation building 4 tion process after all aldults cannot be
 he felt that canada could ask that the children expected to become other than superficial canabe introduced to canada and
 that as far as possible dians but children still in the formative period they be put in possession of our
 language and under teachers of the right calibre in non englishtraditions only by such means can they become speaking communities
 readily acquire the one with us 5 the children would play the role language and am quick to adopt canadian
 ways of mediators between the old world and the new and custom 7 secondly the english language was to be
 used as the sole language of instruction we cannot forte the immigrant to be a canadian but it is our
 business to underst and him to reach and use of the students own language in school out for points of
 contact to offer something better would be discouraged as much as possible the more than thirty children from the polish
 community attended this school at polonia alberta in 1923 department of education did not permit any form little thought had
 been given by the governof bilingualism in school or any form of ment to the effects of its policy on
 the children multiculturalism who were virtually compelled to give up their this is an english speaking province said parents language
 in favour of english the mr boyle tthe minister of education and following statement may exagger ate the total every
 alberta boy and girl should receive a sound emotional and psychological impact of angliciza english education in the public schools
 of the tion but no doubt them is a great deal of truth to it province 8 to be sure
 he problems which confronted the children who have attended an english only province at that time were enormous it was
 not school can never really communicate with their unusual for a school inspector to report that one parents who have
 been raised in a germanspeaking environment the parents cannot relate half of the rural districts in this inspectorate are to
 t he anglophone culture propagated by the in foreign settlements the nationalities of which school and the children do not
 underst and are french german norwegian swedish and german culture the spirit ual and intellectual rift galician 9 small wonder
 that teaching in a one becomes even more apparent when full denationroom rural elementary school around the turn of alization
 in school has been accomplished and the children have become assimilated to the the century was sometimes compared to having
 foreign language and culture to such an extent been dropped in a foreign land and schools wer e that they
 feel at home only in it then the frequently regarded as human mixing bowls children with their hearts and minds
 live in a yet the schools had been chosen quite deliberately cultural space which is alien to their as the
 instrument for the assimilation of the denationalized parents immigr ant as early as 1903 a school inspector inspector thibodeau s
 terse statement in 1918 for northern alberta wrote in a report to his sums up very well the attitude displayed
 by the supervisor officials of the department of education viz hat the quickest and surest method of assimilating english was
 to be the only language taught and t he foreign element s in our population is through used for instruction
 in any school in his inspecour schools here is seen the ready adoption of torate and that consequently there was
 no dress language manners and customs the best teacher s better for not using the language bilingual problem in his
 part of the province of the locality should be secured for these as late as 1929 the most signaficant factor
 foreign schools acting as a barrier to further educational progress in the view of school inspectors was the fact teachers
 were urged to devote double the that a language other than english had been and proportion of rime to english
 and to be very careful that the pupil left school with a working frequently was still spoken in many families
 knowledge of our language even if he never inspector robinson from lamont noted the fact mastered the intricacies of vulgar
 factions or that in his district 52 percent of the homes were square root there was no attempt on the
 part entirely ukrainian 23 percent were partly of any boani to have any part of the schoolday ukrainian and 24
 percent were english and devoted to the teaching of any foreign language german from the turn of the century on
 this nor was there any district which employed a teacher capable of teaching the language of the state of affairs
 had been perceived to have serious settler where this language was other than consequences english 7 a very considerable number
 of parents do not but if the pupils could not speak english when speak english to their children and they
 conse they entered school should not the teacher have quently start to school with a very serious been able to
 speak their language the departhandicap much of their time during the first years of school must be spent in english
 exercises ment s attitude is reflected in the reports submitted and progress is very slow this condition is by several
 inspectors to the minister of education rendered more serious on account of the fact that with so many languages and
 nationalities in the many of these non english districts have very country it would be impossible to provide each persistent
 desires to employ only teachers who district with a teacher of its own kind i find also speak their own
 language even though they are that it is by no means necessary for the teacher not legally qualified to know
 and use the language of the foreign furthermore department officials often observed speaking children indeed it is oftentimes a that
 some immigrant groups deliberately tried to hindrance 8 it is very encouraging to observe the success keep the english language
 out of the school attained in teaching reading to the foreign on the one hand people complain that they children
 by teachers who knew only the english cannot affoitl a yearly school but on the other language it has been
 my experience that not they support by voluntary contribution for some only in reading but in all departments of the
 months each winter a parochial or foreign school work the greatest advancement is made school i have no objection to
 children knowing under teachers who use english only and who two or more languages but the above practice encourage the
 use of english on the playground together with the home influence and customs as well as in the school during
 the school generally mean these children know so little sessions english that their sympathy with and knowledge while it may
 be an advantage to a teacher to of our institutions and aims as part of a great know the foreign
 language i believe it should nation are practically nil never be used in the presence of the children the need
 for good teaching of english in school the progress of the class will necessarily be slow at first but the
 teacher will accomplish more in was repeatedly emphasized because english often the end by using the english language was not
 spoken in the home from vermillion it exclusively was reported for instance that generally the officials in the department of
 education were conditions in the french schools are fairly good by no means alone in their decision to employ although
 there is a growing tendency in some dis monolingual teachers wherever possible educatricts to neglect the english language with tionalists
 from canada and the united states three exceptions conditions in the ruthenian agreed on this point schools were unsatisfactory and
 little progress was in those localities that insist upon the teacher made in english school boards around being able to
 speak the mother tongue of the onoway insisted that bilingual teachers in french beginners in english it takes as a
 rule twice as canadian schools be competent to give thorough long for the pupils to acquir e a working instruction
 in english with a certain amount of knowledge of english as it requires in numberless good schools conducted by teacher
 s ignorant pride inspector parker from foremost reported of the vernacular from the standpoint of trustees from his district or
 parents therefore in the selection of teachers during the year a determined effort was made good scholarship fluent and idiomatic
 english to strengthen the teaching of english in schools thorough normal training a natural gift for where the settlers were
 of foreign extraction teaching and abundant sympathy enthusiasm and adaptability are infinitely more important than by translation where this latter
 method alone is familiarity with the pupils mother tongue employed the results are unsatisfactory at the same time to the
 teacher who has suffi the approach employed was derived from the cient wisdom and self control never to use the
 direct method of second language teaching vernacular in the schoolroom except as the lesser of two evils a knowledge of
 the mother tongue which avoids the mother tongue altogether and is has been shown to be of value real even
 if very based on establishing associations between consecondary crete objects and the foreign language words it is abundantly clear that
 the keynote of the cor it seems to have been very effective because local rect teaching of english to beginners
 is the histories contain innumerable references to the practically exclusive use of that language in the classr oom and that
 where this is not bringing effect that the children attended school and soon the desired results the fault must be
 sought in learned english more than one teacher had to the teacher s personal and professional qualifi face the fact
 that her children on the first day of cations it is noteworthy that the authorities class knew not one word
 of english but have found it necessary to authorize for general use and guidance of their teachers in non it

 had trouble with the h sound of the english language in school rested on the and a ll of us
 went around poking out our tongues well intentioned conviction of officials of the in this sound department of education that
 this approach was to be sure practical problems such as the the most effective way for immigrant children to resistance
 on the part of some parents to public acquire the english language because these and especially full year schools the
 lack of children learn their second language english as willingness to offer the teacher decent salaries the a child learns
 his mother tongue and not so much terrible living conditions during the winter months the multicultural origins of these students

 community and taking responsibility for as their lack of training and experience created the community in which the immigrants lived
 many difficulties for the community and the the desire to become a true canadian was not department of education officials
 were aware uniformly spread among all immigrants while of the fact that many teachers of english were there were great
 numbers of par ents who wanted insufficiently prepared for the difficult task of their children to gain all the benefits
 that canadian teaching english to foreigners and for this reason citizenship could bring there were others who teachers institutes were
 held for them in 1918 for were indifferent to this noble ideal even worse the first time and in 1920
 a summer school was in the department of education eyes ther e organized at the university of alberta 25 were
 some who made a positive effort to follow yet by the end of world war one school old traditions to
 the subdivision of canadian inspectors all over the province were able to report ideals hat good progress was being made
 in the teaching while one can sympathize with the desire of of english it was noted that although english foreign
 born parents to secure for their children french scandinavian russian and german were a knowledge of their mother tongue yet
 steps spoken in the home the population as a whole ought to be taken to insist that such a desire
 shall not result in depnving any child of his nght to realizing common interests and responsibilities a full share in
 the educational benefits offered showed a keen desire to make english the by our province particularly the benefit of an
 common language 26 the annual report of the inspiration to become a loyal canadian 32 department of education for 1922

 were not only willing education contain many references to instances but anxious to have the school open for the full

 the methods required in some citizens of the growing generation 28 ruthenran distncts m no difficulties of this kind were
 encountered in german speaking good citizenship meant adoption of the districts values of the new country in particular the resistance
 to canadianization came not only acquisition of the principles of democracy from some immigrant quarters but also from through the
