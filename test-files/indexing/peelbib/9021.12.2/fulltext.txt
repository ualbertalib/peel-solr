 a year lo rj lorne in a 1 beri a by rev james macgregor introduction in 1881 the marquis of
 lorne son in law of queen victoria became the first governor general to visit the western canadian prairies leaving quebec
 on j uly 18 th he embarked on an arduous three month tour that took him through much of canada
 s western frontier travelling by railway steamboat canoe and carriage h e saw at first hand the new lands which
 were soon to be opened for settlement miles beyond the end of the steel he also witnessed a few exciting
 pages from the old west indian sham battles a buffalo hunt hudson s bay co forts and mounted police posts
 were seen before the influx of settlers changed the character of the west when lord lorne decided to make the
 trip he sent a telegram to an old friend in edinburgh rev dr james macgregor inviting him to come along
 rev macgregor was pastor of st cuthbert s established church and had one of the largest congregations in scotland he
 informed the kirk session of the invitation and estimated he would be back in eight weeks after a scant fifteen
 days in which to make his plans he boarded the s s sardinian at liverpool on june 16 th and
 met lord lorne in quebec when rev macgregor returned to scotland five months later he was to face a barrage
 of criticism for his long absence and for failing to receive permission from the presbytery to leave his post he
 was criticised also by the presbyterian church of canada for travelling on sunday allegedly using loose language and for condoning
 lord lorne s failure to attend church in winnipeg during his trip rev macgregor provided the edinburgh courant and the
 edinburgh scotsmnan with detailed accounts of his journey the english press was represented on the tour by sydney hall artist
 for the london graphic mr austin of the london times and c h roche of the london telegraph the only
 canadian reporter on the expedition was mr williams of th e toronto globe who as an uninvited guest had to
 make his own travel arrangements and was sometimes a day or more behind the impact of this array of journalists
 was soon evident during the next few weeks the world was given extensive first hand information on the west the
 newsmen were enthusiastic about the rich soil the ranching possibilities of southern alberta the vacant lands which could accommodate many
 hard pressed farmers from europe and the remarkable climate during the fall season it is difficult to determine the effect
 of these articles but they likely influenced many immigrants to come to canada rev macgregor s articles in particular excited
 the scottish population and caused many men to look to canada as a land of opportunity as the scois nan
 observed on nov 1 1881 the publicity opened up to our distressed farmers a land of promise where they could
 take refuge from high rents bad harvests sunless skies and destructive tempests in a land of vast area rich soil
 sunny clime and serene air one member of the expedition lt col francis de winton was so impressed with what
 he saw that he later established a ranch in the alberta foothills and the town of de winton was named
 in his honor the official party travelled from quebec to georgian bay by rail and there transferred to a steamboat
 which took them to thunder bay at that point they reached a portion of the newly constructed canadian pacific railway
 and tra veiled over its uneven tracks for 55 miles from there the party went by canoes to kenora where
 another portion of the c p r carried them to winnipeg after a number of official functions in the winnipeg
 area lord lorne took the c p r to the end of the steel 44 miles past portage la prairie
 at this point the overland expedition began forty seven north west mounted police under col w m herchmer waited with
 96 horses 21 tents and 27 vehicles this included five light three seated carriages which had been specially made for
 the trip a large quantity of presents for the indians accounted in part for the number of vehicles the personnel
 of the expedition varied over the weeks that followed but included lord lorne rev macgregor col de winton military secretary
 captains percival chater and bagot aides de camp dr cohn sewell medical attendant mr campbell private secretary monsieur bocquet a
 french chef and members of the press when they set out from the end of the steel there were 77
 persons in the expedition the party went across the prairies to fort ellice qu appelle and fort canton there they
 boarded the s s northcote which took them to prince albert and then took the s s lily to battleford

 the two saskatchewans countering them there have been men almost at th e same moment we saw that resident in

 found rived at our destination after a long and the embryo city of the rocky mountains weary trip of five
 weeks and a day it is very small but its future is pro we encountered numerous obstacles mising as well
 as the future of the sursome dangers and a great many delays rounding country its natural wealth is the scenery
 and country were as mag great and consists of very fertile land nificant as the trip was long and weary
 abundance of forest for lumber and fuel however we are at edmonton in fair and large stores of coal some
 of which health and spirits and while we have we saw on the banks of the river and been resting
 and recruiting our beings gold this land only waits for the we have been gathering information people who must come
 to develop it about our new country the land looks but the journey to edmonton is so difbeautiful and the
 soil is as fertile as ficult and long that few find their way any in the world and the mosquitoes
 here are as diligent in their attendance upon letter from joseph hogarth aug 8 the white man as their brother

 in a drizzling rain which seemed somewhat to be in harmony with the occasion and when the call came all
 on board for the tzznicz an it brought tears to the eyes of many who were saying good bye to
 relatives and friends the trip across the atlantic took us ten days arriving in montreal we spent a couple of
 days there before boarding the c p r train for the west the train journey to edmonton revealed many kinds
 of grand scenery both cultivated and wild at moose jaw a number of indians were on the platform gayly dressed
 in blankets and feathers and war paint they looked a little ferocious i thought and i said to my husband
 ‘ 1 wonder if the indians in lesser slave lake are anything like these creatures he assured me they were
 not after five days and nights on the train we arrived at strathcona depot which was the end of steel
 in th ose days our train journey from calgary to edmonton was often so very slow that a few men
 got out and walked by the side of the train for a mile or so from strathcona we took the
 bus to edmonton and a pretty rocky road it was we stayed at the alberta hotel for a week and
 the landlady mrs jackson was kindness itself to us we were intensely interested in all we saw in edmonton we
 had quite a bit of business to do and provisions to buy for the next six months we also purchased
 a gun and shooting outfit a couple of iron bedsteads and a few chairs in those days the large four
 seated tended to cross the bridge at the verdemocrat stage left edmonton twice milion river that night and stay at
 a week so we travelled to athabasca farm a few miles further this was quite impossible as the bridge was
 broken and landing by buck board with th e mail it was too dark to attempt to ford the man
 we could only take with us our stream close to the vermilion river grub box roll of bedding and one
 valise was an unoccupied native shack which we hadn t left edmonton two hours had an old stove but no
 windows and before we began to realize what mud only mother earth for a carpet we had holes were like
 a rainstorm the day plenty of rugs and blankets so soon before had covered up the regular beaten the openings
 were fixed up while i proroad with a depth of 15 to 18 inches pared supper we had enormous apof
 water in many places and before we petites on that trip mr holmes then got to the middle of a
 mud hole our put down an old door on th e floor and horses would begin to founder in the
 on top of it piled some spruce boughs water after a number of these exper rugs and blankets making it
 quite comiences our progress was delayed at one fortable for a night s repose i had only mud hole which
 was so deep that the been asleep a short time when i felt driver got down and lifted our box

 as soon as it was daybreak we had word of ch eer to all the missionaries breakfast rolled up our
 bedding and made one feel what a privilege it was intended to cross the river however to give of our
 best for god s work one there was such a strong current with of her favorite hymns was work for
 the three or four feet of water the driver night is coming and she set us all didn t appear
 to relish the experience that worthy example because he wasn t sure of his horses mr holmes suggested he should
 take our on sept 1 st we started on the last grub box and bedding over first and stage of
 our journey in a york boat then return for us this he consented owned by messrs bredin and cornwall to
 do after much persuasion the horses who had a large fur trading post at made the trip wonderfully and when
 lesser slave lake the boat was about we were crossing th e driver said to me forty feet long and
 built for freight only now just sit still put your feet on the we made ourselves as comfortable as seat
 and hang on tight or else you will possible near the stern there was no be swept off into the
 current protection from the weather the boat the mud banks on both sides of the was drawn by indians or
 h alf breeds river were awfully steep and we had who towed the boat with a long heavy a glorious
 slide from the top of the bank rope there were twelve men to a boat until we struck the old
 ford the water and they took their turns in relays of was so deep that the floor of the buck
 four changing every forty minutes this board was well washed but the horses seemed a slow mode of travelling in
 with difficulty climbed up the steep which to cover 200 miles to lesser slave muddy bank on the other side
 lake we expected to do the journey in eight to ten days but owing to heavy the trip from edmonton
 to athabasca freight on board bad weather and low landing took three and a half days on water we were
 eighteen days the last day the weather was beautiful at athabasca landing we met other we enjoyed the trip h
 oweyer the missionaries who were going to wabasca trackers as the men were called gave and chipewyan bishop and mrs
 young me much amusement frequently the at athabasca lived in a comfortable log thickly wooded banks had no towing shack
 and we stayed a week there wait path and the men would scramble along ing for more freight to arrive
 from ed the side of the high river banks almost monton falling into the river or there would he a
 great tributary to cross and they would there were very few houses at the plunge into the water with a
 laugh and landing in 1902 the bishop was up a sh out they were merry fellows and the mackenzie river
 visiting the different tugged the boat along up to their armpits mission stations but mrs young didn t in water
 for a short time or they would always go on these long treacherous have to scramble over a huge tree
 which trips she was a charming lady never had fallen across their tracks shall i forget our morning and evening
 prayer and readings and the singing at 6 30 p m we camped for the night of the doxology each
 morning after in our tent pitched under some fine old breakfast two lady missionaries were spruce the gangway from the
 boat also in the house waiting for their boat to the shore was four large oars laid although they were
 going to wabasca together across this the indians carand fort chipewyan which was in the ned our grub and bedding
 and more opposite direction to lesser slave lake than once i was carried across and up they told us about
 their experience with the steep hill to where our tent was the indians we slept very comfortably and mrs young
 overhauled our outfit of awoke at 5 am to find it still raining provisions and clothing for our journey already
 the indians had made a fire in up the river she had had much expeni front of our tent one
 of the trackers once in this work for her home was a told us in english that he had seen
 sort of junction for those engaged in bears at large all night but there was north west missions her life
 had been nothing to fear as they seldom come a very practical one and her parting near campfires 19 it
 rained most of the day and we were we were soon scudding before the wind glad to turn in to
 our tent again the at about eight miles an hour indians found a native drum on the trail and beat
 it incessently that night sing very soon the wind became too ing their native ya ya ch ya mr bredin
 strong and we pulled ashore for shelter said no white man could give the same here we camped for three
 days before intonation as the indians to the weird the terrible wind ceased delicious wild ya ya fruit was plentiful
 saskatoons and raspberries and thimbleberries and we the scenery was much the same for caught fish as our bread was
 all eaten most of the long trip and became a bit i had my first experience in making banmonotonous from
 various signs the nock by a campfire indians said there were bears feeding in the distance after dinner next day
 on the third night the wind went when the crew was resting a huge bear down and at midnight we
 had to strike came down to th e river to drink and tent and go aboard for the last seventy
 then disappeared an indian was at miles of our trip but presently the rain once dispatched to surprise mr bear
 poured down in torrents and the open he took his gun powder horn and shot boat had to be tied
 up at the mouth of and made off into the thick bush at a a creek later on we made
 another brisk pace when a shot was heard start and a tent sheet was put over our two of the
 trackers ran off and later came heads we were very glad to reach in sight dragging the carcass of a
 huge lesser slave lake settlement eventually bear out of the bush then they ran and arrived there soaking wet mr
 back and brought two half grown cubs bredin lent us his bachelor shack and they spoke to mr bredin in
 cree and put a huge fire in the stove so we soon told him that the mother of the cubs
 changed into dry clothes and enjoyed was caught in a trap and was so torn a hearty meal and thin
 that they shot her and brought th e cubs the anglican mission was across the lake and arrangements were made
 for there was great rejoicing and feast us to cross in a peterborough canoe ing among the indians for the
 hudson s when we were half way across the lake bay company gave thirty five or forty a big wind
 suddenly sprang up and we dollars in trade for a full grown bear in felt our last hour had come
 for the water season they skinned the bears and was so choppy making us feel we might that evening had
 a feast next morning upset any minute one of the characterthey begged for medicine from mr bredin istics of lesser
 slave lake is its sudden for they had eaten too much half cooked squalls which arise without any warnbear and
 very little bannock ing at last we reached the promised land as i had called lesser slave lake a few
 days later we had rather a that night we sang the doxology for nasty experience as we reached some our
 travelling mercies had been many rapids where an island divided the we had left england aug 2 nd arriving river
 the boat began to grind along at lesser slave lake on sept 18 th the bottom and finally struck aground
 next morning we noticed the union the trackers tugged at the rope but jack was flying and on enquining found
 could not move the boat so they jumped that it was raised when the york boat into the water and
 putting their was in harbor in those days mail only shoulders under the boat managed to came in once in
 six weeks you may move her sideways we were nearly judge that it was a time of great rejoicupset but
 luckily drifted into deeper ing and everybody dropped their work water i can t say we exactly enjoyed and ran
 down to the shore as soon as the the rapids for more than once the boat york boat arrived to
