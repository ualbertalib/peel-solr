 coal mining camps of western canada while often neglected by historians in favour of the more colourful and lively gold
 rush towns have played an important role in the economic and social development of the west remote from other settled
 areas the collieries exploited the single staple product which fueled the colonizing railways of canada isolated from large crowded cities
 the miners relied upon their own ingenuity to establish progressive communities while the resources for economic exploitation came from the
 large cities outside the these areas the means for community building came from the miners themselves one of these insular
 communities branch area lie just south of the main which managed to overcome its isola edmonton yellowhead route the g
