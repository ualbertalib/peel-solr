 manage the estate relationship between nicholas sheran and mary year after year joseph mcfarland wanted to see brown justice dl
 scott certainly saw the case it settled and the assets disposed of to the rightful in those terms when he
 wrote ‘‘ the only quesheir or heirs his position was outlined by tion to be determined is whether deceased charles

 discharge although no one disputed the fact that they were obtained the natural sons of nicholas sheran and mary i
 am informed and believe that there are no debts brown or liabilities due or owing by the said nicholas sheran
 deceased or by his estate to any person whomsoever the upshot was that on oct 28 1899 justice excepting a
 certain promissory note given by the ad scott awarded the nicholas sheran estate to ministratrix to whom letters of adminisiraiion
 were ellen sheran originally granted and a period of nearly fifteen years has now elapsed since the death of the
 said nicholas scott s decision which struck me as unjust sheran unfair and racially motivated was hailed by the thus
 began a court case involving the nicholas macleod gazette as an important judgment in sheran estate at the time the
 estate seemed to relation to white indian marriages in the consist of the sheran mine the house some cat territories

 this ‘‘ note settlers are requested to sign this report when visited by patrolman who is instructed to ask if
 there are any complaints and to call at every ranche on his line of patrol in theory this is all
 very well and sounds lovely but is is impracticable a number of ranchers hereabout cannot speak a word of english
 and those who cannot would be so flabbergasted at the sight of a north west mounted policeman with these papers
 in his hand riding into the yard that he would be unable to speak at all much less go through
 the red tapery of signing his name to the report if the rancher has any complaint worthy of lodgment he
 ll lodge it himself quick enough only too quick as a general thing taking into consideration the jealousies and enmities
 which but too often are to be seen in country districts amongst neighbors this idea of a policeman riding around
 practically inviting them to air grievances and lodge complaints making it easy is unwise to say the least the complaints
 would run like this ‘‘ well i tell you mister dot sawn of a gawn ole slonjugglooski i borrow him
 a wagon to go to town he got drawn and break whipple tree he no pay oh he son of
 a etc what is mr policeman to do in a case of that kind they will all be of that
 nature if the grievances are at all serious the complainants will not daily waiting for the policeman to come around
