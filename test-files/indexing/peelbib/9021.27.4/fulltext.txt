 no responsibility for statements of fact or opinion made by authors reflections of an alberta communist the hungry thirties by
 ben swankey history is usuallythought of asachron ology of events occurring at a particular time but it is also or
 at least it can also â€˜ i be an account of the thoughts feelings and convictions that motivated people that
 moved them to take the actions that made history i would like to describe some of the thoughts and feelings
 as well as the experiences that caused me a young prairie boy just out of a small town high school
 to join the communist movement in the early years of the hungry thirties and to take an active part in
 many of the major labour and farmer struggles of that period f my introduction to the class struggle the term
 we used to describe the conflicts t l between workers and farmers on the one hand and the employers government
 and state ie police courts etc on the other took place not on the prairies but in vancouver for me
 it was both sudden and dramatic when i graduated from grade 12 in herbert sask in 1931 i automatically entered
 the ranks of the unemployed with no the author lef t rear is seen behind his sister joyce job opportunities
 available in my home in 1932 the year of edmonton s hunger march town like many other young men i
 decid look good so we decided to abandon our edtolookforgreenerfieldsthatoffered if world trip we separated and each went not jobs
 then at least some excitement his own way that is when i became inand adventure so another young unem volved
 in interests and activities that ployed man peter janzen and i conceived changed the whole course of my life the
 idea of going around the world the first leg of our journey took us to during the 1930 s ben
 swankey was secret v w h d i l aryoftheyoungcommunistleagueinalberta in the spring of 1940 along with 100 other hitchhiked

 he served until his discharge meal times than meals in 1946 from 1946 until 1957 he was alberta it took
 us about three weeks to get to leader of the labour progressive party since vancouver the prospect for continuing our
 trip of being able to work our way journalist author and lecturer across the pacific on a freighter didn t
 on aug 1 1931 after being in van i began to read left wing literature the couverforonlyaboutaweek mybrother mimeographed paper
 put out by the who was on unemployment relief and i unemployed in vancouver the worker decided to attend a
 demonstration on published by the communist party head cambie street grounds workers unity quarters in toronto pamphlets put out the

 i also began to atgrounds they were denied a parade per tend more public meetings called by the mit unemployed
 and other left wing groups i on finishing his speech herndl put the found them intensely interesting question to the
 meeting do you want to and i continued to follow events across parade amightyroarof yes wasthe canada many of which
 moved me response banners and a red flag were deeply the workers unity league carried raised and the people began
 to move off through a nation wide petition campaign the grounds gathering 100 000 signatures in support of non contributory
 unemployment in the police both mounted and on foot were ready for us waiting on side streets surance a guaranteed
 work week and a minimum wage of 25 a week every they charged the crowd unmercifully where unemployed organizations under
 beating anyone and everyone within communist leadership demanded the reach of their long clubs men women and children all became
 victims there government undertake make work prowas no discrimination the demonstrators grams and carried on militant battles for relief fought
 back with anything they could lay their hands on stones sticks gravel i soon became convinced that the comanything i
 remember that the picket munists had the answers i sought fence around a service station on pender to fully understand
 the attraction of street disappeared within minutes as communist ideas and action programs people including me tore off pickets and
 one must understand the state of mind went after the police the battle spilled many of us were in during
 the hungry over into victory square as the police thirties the economic crisis with a quarpursued us clubbing right and
 left of terofthepopulationoutofworkandwith course the unarmed crowd was no a majority of prairie farmers destitute match for hundreds of armed
 police was a traumatic experience for all who went through it it left emotional scars i saw blood on the
 pavement that day and political lessons that remained with and many broken heads in fact i briefly many of us
 for the rest of our lives saw max herndl clubbed into unconsciousness lying near the curb with we couldn t
 understand why food was blood flowing from a wound in his head being destroyed while people were going beside him
 was the peaked cap he had hungry why oranges were being dumped into the ocean in california why coffee worn
 stuffed with paper to cushion the was being burned in brazil why gasoline blows of the police clubs which he
 ap was being poured over apples in the parently expected okanagan why should there be hunger that brutal police attack
 on the meeting in the midst of plenty how could there be shook all my beliefs all the values i
 had too much food when so many people accumulated in school and the commun were going without why should people
 ity my sense of justice was outraged my be evicted because they couldn t pay belief in freedom of speech
 and assem rent or lose their homes because they bly myacceptanceoftheroleofpoliceas couldn t pay taxes our economic and the guardians
 of society all these were political system seemed to have gone shaken to their foundations i couldn t crazy understand
 what had happened i was an we asked ourselves why were the police gry and i sought answers attacking and
 beating up people who par the unemployed men in vancouver are seen here proceeding to a picnic in stanley park
 it was in one of the demonstrations by this group that caused the author to become interested in communism aded
 and demonstrated just because in 1930 he had promised a winnipeg they wanted jobs and relief how was it audience
 if the conservative party is thatthecourtswerealwaysonthesideof elected to power not a man woman or the employers in labour disputes that
 it child in canada will ever go hungry and was always strikers who were arrested that unemployment would be solved
 by and sent to jail never employers even christmas it was now 1931 unemploywhen they openly broke the law why
 did ment was getting worse and many people the daily papers business leaders and were hungry most of the politicians
 attack socialism so when the workers unity league petifiercely claiming it was anti god and tion with 100 000 signatures
 was presentwould destroy all our moral values why ed to prime minister bennett by a 35 weretheysoalarmedaboutthegrowthof member delegation in
 april 1931 headsocialism and why were they attacking ed by wul secretary tom mcewan benthe soviet union with such hatred
 if nett s reply was both emphatic and inthings there were as bad as they claimed suiting no government with
 which i am why were they so afraid of them associated he declared will ever con we also wanted to
 know why the sider this we will not put a premium on communist party was outlawed when idleness we knew
 from our own experience that it there were many types of socialists was helping the unemployed and the that we
 listened to at meetings and farmers and leading strikes to protect the whose publications we read they were living standards
 of those still fortunate good at criticizing the political system enough to have work but they were short on action
 on what to the liberal and conservative parties do about it they included leaders of the and governments didn t
 have answers canadian labour party the independent that made sense to many of us their labour party and similar groups
 their promises proved worthless i don t recall solution was usually vote for me but how strong my political views
 were at age our main concern was where do we eat 17 butl remember that when iwas head today and
 where do we get a job tomoring west for vancouver i considered my row self a conservative and in arguments
 the communists on the other hand defended our new prime minister r b seemed to us to have the answers
 they bennett when campaigning for election had an explanation for the troubles plaguing our society they had a program of
 subsistence bankruptcy follows upon that offered what sounded to us a realistic bankruptcy execution upon execution the stagnation lasts for
 years productive forces solution most important of all they had a and products are wasted and destroyed program of action
 based on unity of wholesale until the accumulated mass of labour and farmers to compel government commodities finally filter off
 more or less to take immediate remedial action furth depreciated in value until production and exchange gradually begin to move
 again ermore we saw that it was the communists who led most struggles for jobs for i liked what engels
 said about the userelief against wage cuts for the organi lessness of the capitalist class often zation of the unorganized
 often and in repeated by socialist orators who declarfact usually at great personal sacrifice ed that the owners of industry
 were about their rewards more often than not as necessary to production as fleas to a were arrests beatings and
 jail terms dog he continued they offered convincing proof that they all the social functions of the capitalist are carried
 on actions not for personal bene now performed by salaried employees the capitalist has no further social function than fit
 but to help people in need that of pocketing the dividends tearing off communisis took the initiative in or coupons

 and old age pen engel s contention that society is divided sions at 60 rather than age 70 which pre
 into two main contending economic vailed at that time classes labour and capital and the class war between these two
 over the distribu tous communistsdidn tjusttalk they tion of the values produced by labour is did things they set up
 organizations and inevitable as long as capitalism lasts engaged in all sorts of actions to help similarily my experience seemed
 to me people gain their demands to verify their contention that the state at the same time we wanted answers
 the laws governing institutions courts to such fundamental questions as why police armed forces etc were simply must we have
 economic crises the ans the instrument that the ruling class used wers of the economists and politicians to maintain its
 dominant position didn t make sense in the communist manifesto they marx and engels on the other hand ex stated
 the proposition in these words plained that it was due to the unplanned the executive of the modern state is
 but nature of capitalist production the an a committee for managing the common archy resulting from competitive produc affairs of
 the whole bourgeoisie tion which every ten years or so produced to this day i can remember how fascia surplus
 resulting in an economic depres nated i was by engels concept that the sionthatlasteduntilthesurpluswasused history of human society is governed
 by up in one way or another evolutionary laws that can be discovered in his book socialism utopian and and
 understood he explained why prim scientific engels described economic itive communal society had given way to crises in a way
 i could understand slavery slavery to feudalism and feuda commerce is at a standstill the markets are lism to capitalism
 and why socialism was glutted products accumulate as multitudinous as they are unsaleable hard cash disap inevitable the basic cause
 of these pears credit vanishes factories are closed changes he said was the development of the mass of workers are
 in want of the means the productive forces of society which after communist ieader tim buck was released from kingston
 penitentiary in 1935 he was given a hero s welcome in the alberta mining town of nordegg periodically led to
 the development of communist offices and the homes of new economic classes and the struggle their leaders were ransacked even
 doors between these classes for supremacy torn off their hinges and all books papers the state the laws the religion
 and personal and otherwise on the premises culture of any epoch he said invariably were carted off as it turned
 out later reflected the views and interests of the none of the materials seized was ever ruling class of the
 period used as evidence against the accused for the first time history became inter nor were they ever returned esting
 for me it ceased to be a mean raiding homes and offices of left wing ingless accumulation of dates events
 organizations and seizing libraries and and wars and took on meaning because papers was a common practice in the cause
 and effect were now explained thirties by the rcmp the provincial and engels in his socialism utopian and local police
 forces the legality or illegal scientific explained the concept in these ity of these actions didn t bother the words
 police since they were acting with the the final causes of al socia changes and agreement of the governments concernpolitical
 revolutions are to be sought not in ed they knew quite well they had the man s brains notin man
 sbetterinsightinto support of the media and that there eternal truths and justice but in changes in wasn t a court
 or judge in the land who the modes of production and exchange they are to be sought not in the
 philosophy but in would challenge their actions the economics of each particular epoch the growing perception that existing social instit
 the arrested communist leaders were utions are unreasonable and unjust that rea charged under section 98 of the criminal son
 has become unreason and right wrong code with being members of an unlawful is only proof that in the modes
 of production and exchange changes have silently taken party this was the first time in canadian place withwhichthe social order
 adaptedto history that any political party had been earlier economic conditions is no longer in so charged section 98 was
 the legislation keeping that had been rushed through the com on aug 11 1931 while i was still in mons

 over 40 wounded the rcmp full of food we do not believe that thou followed up the shooting by conducting
 a sands of farmers and their families should door to door search for union activists it starve because they cannot

 to that these things cannot be changed break a strike and smash a union and he threw back in the
 faces of the as itturned out the strikewas not brokprosecution their charges that commun en nor was the union smashed

 took me some time amount including half a boxcar of food to accept the concept of evolution but from sympathetic
 farmers which was when i did after a good deal of study and shipped to the strikers thought i concluded
 that there was a that strike captured my imagination scientific explanation forthe origin ofthe the miners were members of the

 that labour school later became sions between nationalities and aided by prominent in the labour farm and the Ã§hurch 0:church succeed
 in breaking the strike cooperative movements as organizers and setting up a company union and leaders a number were elected
 to ail the other mining camps stayed firm public office and finally on labour day in early sept the next
 big event in which i particiembe 1932 the coal operators capitu pated was the alberta hunger march lated the miners
 won their strike and held in edmonton on dec 20 1932 it turned back an earlier wage cut in fact
 the brought together some 12 000 people crow s nest pass coal miners were one of 2 000 of them
 farmers in a common de which to hold meetings in this we had the full cooperation of the ukrainian labour
 temple on 96 th street operated by the ukrainian labour farmer temple association we also had at our disposal the
 facilities of the youth centre next door an abandoned church that had been taken over by the young communist league
 and other youth groups the main demands raised by the hunger march committee in consultation with local organizations were non
 contributory unemployment insurance there was at this time no unemployr ent insurance of any kind the closing of the 20
 cents a day relief camps called slave camps by their inmates cash relief instead of bags of groceries or scrip
 relief for farmers and an end to evictions and foreclosures in both city and country an even more difficult problem
 was getting farmers into edmonton the rcmp acting on the orders of the brownlee government not only issued warnings to
 farmers not to come to the city for the march they stopped cars and trucks turning back any they suspected
 of going to edmonton for that purpose the result wasthatfarmers hadtoslip intothecityat night by side r oads not patrolled by
 the police the fact that some 2 000 made it into the city despite the obstruction of the police was
 proof of their determination the ukrainian labor farmer association tempie in edmonton was a rallying piace for those organizing the
 hunger march mand for relief jobs and security on the farm it was undoubtedly one of the political highlights of
 alberta during the depression years its size is better appreciated if one bears in mind that edmonton at the time
 had a population of 80 000 almost a quarter of the adult population of the city attended this demonstration the
 hunger march was initiated at a provincial workers and farmers conference held in edmonton in october of that year the
 communist party although banned the year before continued to function underground and was to air their grievances and take their
 demands direct to the government there was the added problems that labour mayor dan knott and his labour majority on
 city council in cooperation with premier brownlee had refused to grant a permit for a parade from the market square
 to the provincial legislature had the parade permit been granted the parade would undoubtedly have been peaceful and without incident
 it appeared however that the provincial government the city fathers and the police were determined not to allow any parade
 and to teach the reds a lesson on monday morning dec 19 the day active in helping to organize the
 march i was secretary of the young communist league in northern alberta at the time we had about 1 000
 members in the area my job was to help organize the youth contingent of the hunger march the organization of
 the march was no small job meetings had to be held with various organizations throughout the province on the sending
 of local contingents food and lodging had to be arranged for the many hundreds of farmers unemployed workers and others
 coming in from points outside the city we had to find halls in before the demonstration a squad of 20
 rcmp and 50 city police raided the ukrainian labour temple and the youth centre next door while the early arrivals
 for the march were having their noon meal the police claimed they were searching for firearms but we understood quite
 well that it was an act aimed at trying to curious crowds cluster around the mounted poiice force close to
 edmonton s market square where the hunger marchers were gathered a few minutes after this photo was taken the police
 and demonstrators were locked in conflict intimidate us and to prejudice the public last speaker and the meeting began to
 against us no firearms were found of move more banners were raised that course nor any clubs but they did
 find peoplehadconcealedontheirpersons to that the halls were well stocked with food join the already colorful array of banners enough to
 feed 3 500 people forfive days and placards that dotted the huge gather one man waino luchtala was arrest ing

 horseback and hills mundare and many other points in the city police on foot attacked everyone the province within reach
 bystanders and marchers when the demonstration convened on alike people were knocked down and the market square on the afternoon
 of many pushed over and trampled on by dec 20 the huge crowd overflowed into the horses of the rcmp
 the streets and sidewalks surrounding the number of police involved ran into the square the hundreds some 150 rcmp reinforcements
 alone had been brought in from a irvine and a half a dozen other regina weweretoldthatpolicemachine speakers addressed the meeting
 and a guns were stationed on the roof of the committee was dispatched to see pre post office just across
 from the square mier brownlee in a last minute attempt to secure permission to parade it reported when the police
 attacked there was back within the hour that permission was momentary panic as people ran for cover still refused the
 speakers then stressed then anger set in and marchers picked up that the people had the right to use the
 anything they could lay their hands on to streets to appeal to their elected gov fight back a number of
 christmas trees ernment and urged that the march be on sale for the holidays were quickly kept orderly grabbed and
 used as clubs or weapons of defence several dozen people climbed they are waiting warned one of the theroofofoneofthemarketsquarebuildspeakers and
 they will use agents to try ings and showered the police with gravel and start trouble but don t be

 the rocky mountains behind us followed those antelope loom large on the horizon the automobile how many persons have ever
 stopped to consider the amount of money that is wrapped up in automobiles in western canada take automobile owners and
 dealers themselves and ten chances to one they have never given this thought a moment s reflection if one man
 could collect the money that has been paid out for choo choo cars in the west it is safe to
 estimate that he would almost approach the millionaire mark at all events he would not be required to live on
 ham sandwiches and toothpicks a conservative estimate of the number of cars in winnipeg is placed at 175 while something
 like 125 are believed to be scattered throughout the other points of the west the price of machines run all
 the way from 1 000 to 5 000 at an average cost of 2 500 each the money invested in
 machines in western canada would therefore aggregate about 750 000 of this amount 437 500 would be tied up in
 winnipeg with 312 500 in the country points the demand for autos has never been brisker than at present and
 all the local dealers report that their greatest trouble has been to supply the wants of the westerners the taste
 of the westerners is a substantial one while runabouts are numerous still the heavier cars are more sought after with
 the knowledge that they are not only more lasting but at the same time of more value automobile clubs in
