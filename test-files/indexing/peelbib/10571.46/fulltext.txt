 7 historical article ppcli first regimental parade 12 august 1914 landsdowne park ottawa ontario editor s note the following article 
 initially appeared in the 7 november 0:novem 0:ber 1982 issue of the islander times colonist publication the article 0:arti 0:cle 
 is reprinted with the kind permission of the author mr ken stofer 0:stof 0:er bill riley has lived in victoria 
 for 22 years but sad to say i have only had the pleasure of knowing this 87 year old gentleman 
 for the last eight months we met quite by chance when he phoned to say he had read a story 
 in the islander in which i had quoted one of his poems since that day i have visited bill and 
 his attractive wife blanche nearly every 0:ev 0:ery week at their home near elk lake leaving bill is like putting 
 down a good book while with him if one just listens the chapters of his life will quench a thirst 
 for yesteryear i learned he is one of three survivors of the original princess patricia s 0:pat 0:ricia 0:s canadian 
 light infantry which departed quebec city september 0:septem 0:ber 1914 on the royal george bound for england and the mud 
 and gore of the first world war by christmas they had left england for le havre by horse transport 0:trans 
 0:port and moved on to blaringhem bill can t remember how many miles it was from blaringhem to dickebouch whether 
 he went part way by transport or walked all the way nor can he recall the exact date i don 
 t know he says we marched a long way because my feet and ankles were blistered and skinned it was 
 so bad i collapsed by the wayside there were many others in bill s unit who were unable to stand 
 the ill fitting heavy boots that seemed to be made of wood there was a rule that no one was 
 to be helped and the heavy packs the men were carrying were not to be put on the horse drawn 
 limbers however for some reason bill was given permission he tried to throw his pack on to one but didn 
 t have enough strength and it fell to the muddy road the wagons following rode over it my kit including 
 my princess mary s 1914 christmas cigarette box that i still possess and use for postage stamps was damaged i 
 have never attempted to have the little brass box straightened out to me it is a treasure i love it 
 dickebouch was a deserted village except for a few families of old men and women young ladies and children who 
 had born the brunt of german occupation back and forth during the first battle of mons at that time the 
 invaders were driven back by the british old contemptibles 0:con 0:temptibles the princess pat s brigaded with the king s 
 royal rifles shropshire light infantry and the rifle brigade and took over to hold whatever gains the contemptibles had made 
 and what gains they were with the enemy still holding the high ground leaving the low muddy ditches for bill 
 and the pats they were billeted in the village until dusk on january 4 1915 and then headed for the 
 front line to relieve a french regiment after marching a mile or so they were ordered to form a single 
 file it was a pitch black night with heavy sleet falling they were wet through and very tired orders were 
 to touch the man in front or get lost during the mons battle wire entanglements had been left shell holes 
 and ditches full of water impeded their progress through the mud the man in front would pass word back wire 
 underfoot jump ditch the man behind him would also pass the word back but each time there was a danger 
 of losing sight of the man in front bill did just that missed the jump fell backwards into mud and 
 water rifle and all and lost contact they had previously been told that in such a case to stay put 
 and pass word back that contact had been lost to the nco at the rear of the line the nco 
 was walter draycott now 100 years old and living in north vancouver 
 8 evidently aware a move of some sort was taking place out there the germans kept up a steady rat 
 a tatt tatt of machine gun and rifle fire blindly shooting into the dark of the night bill remembers it 
 was a slow tortuous advance with heads down as far as possible while bullets 0:bul 0:lets whistled overhead finally we 
 arrived at our destination horror of horrors our eyes were more or less becoming accustomed to the dark and there 
 in front of us standing in mud and water scarceley able to move were human beings covered with slime cold 
 and soaked to the hide after a steady 48 hour vigil most of them were unable to crawl out without 
 assistance so this was our assignment to relieve them for the next 48 hours after which we too had to 
 be dragged out by some other poor joes bathroom facilities were not hard to find right at our feet as 
 a matter of fact if one stepped two feet aside he would be trespassing on the other guy who had 
 his pants down we had to remain there never straying but standing or leaning on the side of the ditch 
 where our fingers would sink into the mud i ll venture to say that i believe very few of our 
 rifles were in working order being all gummed up with mud and quite useless if the germans had known this 
 and acted we would have been sitting ducks in nearby dickebouch the few residents were happy to have the troops 
 present the girls rolled and sold them cigarettes and were very hospitable little as it was it brought a great 
 deal of sunshine into lives where no other sunshine existed this was just the beginning of a long war that 
 many thought would be over in a few months early in may 1916 bill had the opportunity to transfer to 
 the 18th battery of canadian field artillery to be with his brother charles it was a pleasant change for him 
 it was a smaller unit that was not forever 0:for 0:ever on the move as was the infantry they had 
 18 pounder guns and his position on the gun was number three to lay and fire the feeling of having 
 a specified job that required a bit of thought along with six close gun crew companions to chat with appealed 
 to him living conditions such as cooking and bedding down were much improved at passchendale the horse lines were at 
 the demolished ypres asylum bill s battery of six guns increased from four was on the zonibeck 0:zo 0:nibeck road 
 about a mile away there was nothing but mud and tremendous 0:tre 0:mendous water filled shell holes in all directions 
 bill had been at vimy in april the somme in september but this was the limit he said his brother 
 charles was four years older and his eldest brother fred was a captain in the canadian engineers quartered in a 
 dugout the other side of ypres on november 4 1917 chuck arrived back from england after being commissioned as a 
 lieutenant he came directly to see me at the horse lines and we decided to hike over to see brother 
 fred we were standing outside fred s dugout when fritzy s bombers were heard chuck remarked we had better split 
 up lest we all three get it in the neck the shock could also cause the death of our dear 
 mother if that happened chuck and i returned to the horse lines which turned out to be the bomber s 
 target the rest of that night we spent attending to our dead and wounded comrades and shooting wounded horses four 
 days after chuck s return to the front on november 9 1917 he was killed not a half mile from 
 me when his battery was heavily shelled he was a fine man well over six feet he always wrote to 
 mother regularly and was about to be ordained for the church of england 0:en 0:gland when he enlisted i saw 
 him buried in flanders bloody fields sewn in an army blanket i visited his grave at vlamentinge cemetary in belgium 
 in 1968 god bless his soul at the end of november 1917 bill became ill with pneumonia and was invalided 
 to england on january 19 1918 he had experienced 37 months to quote bill of mud blood and guts bill 
 riley was one of 425 000 canadians who served overseas in the first world war of this total 60 000 
 gave their lives and many thousands more were wounded bill likes to write poetry and has written a fitting close 
 to this segment 0:seg 0:ment of his most interesting life it is 68 years now since the princess pats were 
 born landing in flanders muddy fields to be worn and torn where groves of towering poplars shattered by bursting shell 
 stood like bloody ghosts on that skyline of hell they numbered some 1200 when they started off to war and 
 then began to dwindle as fritzy took his score the gaps were filled as time went on re enforcements would 
 arrive 0:ar 0:rive today in 1982 just three of them survive 820 bill riley victoria b c 677 william miller

 to regimental affairs it is the general office of the regiment regimental headquarters is responsible for being the secretariat of 
 the regiment maintenance accounting and operating the regimental funds and accounts operating the regimental kit shop operating the regimental museum

 regimental kit shop a new era began on 1 january 1983 the beginning of the new fiscal 0:fis 0:cal year 
 inaugurated a modified regimental merchandising concept which in effect clarified the pricing credit policy and reinforced the mechandise accountability the 
 variety and number of items held has been greatly increased over the past year so that we can now provide 
 almost every item required by units or individuals any support 0:sup 0:port given to the kit shop will benefit the 
 regiment as a whole much work needs yet to be done but it is hoped that our new procedures will 
 not only stimulate sales but provide every member of the regiment 0:regi 0:ment with items at reasonable and uniform prices 
 the new credit policy is that all individual mail orders must be prepaid 0:pre 0:paid unit kit shops making payments 
 within 30 days of purchase receive 0:re 0:ceive a 10 discount therefore some of the profit stays with the unit 
 these procedures will help us to increase our cash flow and allow 0:al 0:low us to provide all patricia s 
 with better service with better service in mind we are also planning to produce a catalogue of all kit shop 
 items looking ahead the 75th anniversary of the regiment is approaching 0:ap 0:proaching rapidly we are considering several souvenir items 
 which will be attractive and will hopefully become special anniversary souvenirs 0:sou 0:venirs a new retail price list is published 
 at the centre fold the regimental museum many of you who have had the opportunity to visit the regimental museum 
 over the last six months have commented kindly on the changes which have been made in the museum foreign visitors 
 especially 0:es 0:pecially were immediately impressed by the quality and variety of our displays this is very gratifying indeed we 
 are constantly striving to improve our displays through visual enhancement or historical correction 0:cor 0:rection to ensure that each display 
 represents a significant era or event in our regiment s history over the last twelve months we received many artifacts 
 of personal 0:person 0:al and or regimental significance our medal collection has been greatly improved by recent acquisition of several 
 sets from wwi patricia s 0:pat 0:ricia 0:s we expect additional donations acquisitions of significance to the regiment in the 
 coming months the museum is ongoing and not merely a displayed storage area therefore additions to the collection are always 
 most welcome any photograph especially of personnel and identified by name would be most helpful photographs without captions while welcomed 
 0:wel 0:comed lose much of their value over the years because people places and events have not been recorded we 
 are more than willing to copy originals and have them returned if so desired the regimental museum warmly welcomes donations 
 of artifacts and memorabilia many items are personal and represent a very significant 0:sig 0:nificant contribution of service to the 
 regiment by the donor other donations are made by families and friends of the regiment however 0:howev 0:er the museum 
 cannot promise to display each and every idea the renovation and necessary expansion presently in the discussion stage will provide 
 more display area which will provide for the inclusion 0:inclu 0:sion of our great small arms collection in an appropriate 
 setting we hope to receive some additional grants from various sources to commence 0:com 0:mence this programme we especially thank

 14 first battalion lieutenant wj stefanuk traditionally the first battalion works and plays hard 1982 was no exception courses were 
 conducted to teach the soldiers the more technical aspects of their profession the battalion participated in field exercices in norway 
 alaska and of course ry 83 in wainwright 0:wain 0:wright during the exercises all members worked hard and the effectiveness 
 0:ef 0:fectiveness of the unit and its sub units steadily improved all members of the battalion participated in either inter 
 company or inter unit sports although competition was stiff a good time was had by all 1983 was a very 
 full year for the first battalion 1984 will be a busy one as well as the battalion prepares for a

 annual exercise conducted by the norwegian army in the north of norway deployment via cf7o7 took place without problems to 
 bardufoss airfield at the beginning of september wo cqms stott quickly learned the rudiments of norwegian as he directed a 
 platoon size working party from our host battalion in the art of erecting a tented camp complete with electric lighting 
 the troops were dispatched on a variety of tasks designed to orient them to soldiering the norwegian way particularly memorable 
 was the afternoon devoted to learning about the brigade pack horse company most thought this would be mildly amusing until 
 they discovered 0:dis 0:covered that they would have to learn how to load their rucksacks onto an unco operative animal 
 a morning was spent firing norwegian 0:norwe 0:gian small arms and vice versa temperamental mountain stoves were mastered and the 
 light patrol tent was tried out when it was discovered that a dismounted norwegian company in the advance to contact

 difficult deployment in which two of the three 2 2 ton trucks broke down things improved and we were able 
 to start on schedule the canoe trippers were off to a good start on the river a strong current enabled 
 good progress with or without paddling frequent rapids on the second and third day caused some problems as only four 
 out of fifteen canoes made it through the two days without 0:with 0:out dumping private lindsay demonstrated the viability of 
 the canoe in the submarine role by guiding his swamped canoe down the rapids over a kilometer x the swift 
 current brought the voyageurs into the town of whitecourt 0:white 0:court a day earlier than anticipated a night in town 
 naturally led to a completely different form of adventure training the second group was able to make the same trip

 other adventures included several ascents of local peaks and rapelling through the icy waterfalls of ogre canyon led by lt

 0:tivities lt m traynor fresh from the slopes of wales and italy developed 0:devel 0:oped a challenging training package which 
 provided the soldiers with the right amount of pucker factor to stimulate their interest during he caving portion the soldiers 
 quickly adapted to the rigours of spelunking 0:spe 0:lunking and found themselves in the depths of the caves exploring stalactites 
 and stalagmites the experience provided them with many tales to recount to their friends and relatives the mountain walk portion 
 of the training commanded by sgt murphy provided a suitable period to relax and enjoy the natural beauty of the 
 kananasksis valley although the fish proved elusive on many occasions the soldiers did manage a fresh supplement to the normal 
 rations naturally outside the provincial park boundaries the success of the caving expedition has led to consideration of additional trips 
 to the crowsnest pass for future adventure training and as part of a spelunking club within the battalion for all

 57 2 airborne commando captain ps mcdonough in a year that has been marked by a series of fast paced 
 business like 0:busi 0:ness 0:like exercises it becomes an understatement to begin our patrician 0:pat 0:rician article with the opening 
 line we were busy with respect for the truth and a little bit of pride all ranks of 2 airborne 
 commando can look back on their efforts with a feeling of satisfaction and accomplishment 0:ac 0:complishment we were busy every 
 year that passes sees the threads that bind our units together 0:togeth 0:er stretched further and further by the demand 
 to maintain our professionalism 0:pro 0:fessionalism and preparedness in case of conflict 2 commando is no different in that respect 
 than any other member of the regimental family the taskings pile up without relief unit strengths are depleted to fulfill 
 our duties yet the lifeblood of our unit continues to run strongly and the job gets done with the same 
 injection of airborne spirit that has been famous for over forty years in the reflective frame of mind necessary to 
 summarize the activities of the unit it becomes 0:be 0:comes clear that the success of 2 commando lies not in 
 a different uniform or special equipment but in the spirit of the soldiers that s our real lifeblood this year 
 as in the past 2 commando has participated in an ambitious 0:am 0:bitious training programme the humourous situations and episodes 
 came at the most vital times when people get tired and hungry fate exerts its power to help lighten the 
 load 2 commando said farewell to captain simon barry from the parachute 0:par 0:achute regiment who has served with us 
 for two years on exchange simon held the posts of operations officer and deputy commanding officer during his stay in 
 canada and each member of the commando 0:comman 0:do will have a special memory of him for better or worse 
 in the patrician 82 we left you at our change of command between 0:be 0:tween lcol wj bewick and maj 
 cp dillon after an all too brief period of annual leave the commando began to conduct a series of airborne 
 0:air 0:borne indoctrination courses for the airborne regiment and other units in the airborne battle group since that time we 
 have run five alc s and put through about 600 candidates for those of you who have not had the 
 experience one such course began with 150 candidates 0:candi 0:dates all chomping at the bit and finished with 96 soldiers 
 who met the airborne standard 2 commando runs all the alc s in the airborne 0:air 0:borne regiment and we 
 like to think we do it pretty well we don t get many complaints anyway i don t care what 
 you say the co can parachute in like the rest of us now let him out just make sure the 
 pointed end goes in first just like christmas you spend all that time wrapping and then it s destroyed tell 
 us what you know or the fish gets it last winter the commando deployed with the rest of the regiment 
 0:regi 0:ment to the depths of the petawawa training area to undergo the questionable pleasure of a winter battle school 
 some comic relief was supplied by a platoon of the british parachute regiment who dropped in for some exchange training 
 they may be wizards at soccer 0:soc 0:cer and they have written the book on cricket and polo but strap 
 six feet of lumber on their feet give them a shove and you re right back in the saddle again 
 actually the group from the old country and we colonialists came out pretty even all things considered and exchanges 0:ex 
 0:changes are planned for the future when the spring melt started 2 commando jumped into the famed 0:fam 0:ed and 
 feared shoot to live programme with both feet three weeks of intensive rangework during which everyone confirmed their ability to 
 pull it s really a squeeze the trigger and hit the center of the visible mass may roared in with 
 a vengence and 2 commando made a journey to the homeland wainwright there safe within the arms of the army 
 of the west we managed to discover the fine points of ry 83 we got four jumps in while the 
 1 cbg order of battle and although we would like to say we all they were all enjoyable there were 
 some parts we were not too keen on tree landings are something that everyone 0:ev 0:eryone likes to talk about 
 but it s hard to find volunteers to demonstrate 0:demon 0:strate feet and knees together guys a composite platoon headed 
 across the pond to the uk for three weeks of what can only be termed pure swan they all qualified 
 for their british para wings by completing four parachute descents from the barrage balloon while we all know it must 
 have been fun it doesn t take three weeks to do four jumps what did they do with the other 
 19 days back in canada a civilian free fall course and scuba programme were occupying the minds and bodies of 
 those not fortunate enough to be overseas we also pulled our share of duty as the airborne regiment s iru 
 and took part in the patricia royal run 2 commando was honoured to run the last leg from wawa to 
 london 0:lon 0:don the 680 miles went by like lightning and we had a lot of fun getting there 
 58 who said no headbands in the field 10 years in the airborne seen it all would you buy a

 74 princess patricia s canadian light infantry regimental band the 1982 83 performance year was hectic demanding and very rewarding 
 as the regimental band was able to complete all requested 0:request 0:ed tasks some of the most challenging assignments were 
 largescale 0:large 0:scale military and civilian ceremonial events those occasions that high light and showcase a military band to best 
 advantage the prime example was our full participation in both troopings of the colour third battalion victoria in june 1983 
 and first battalion 0:battal 0:ion calgary in early july 1983 we were very pleased to have our colonel in chief 
 the countess mountbatten of burma in attendance 0:atten 0:dance at both troopings the actual performances were further enhanced 0:en 0:hanced 
 by the participation of the drums and bugles of the third battalion 0:bat 0:talion the royal green jackets our allied 
 regiment in all two of the most spectacular troopings in recent memory the band participated in the close out ceremonies 
 for the canadian 0:canadi 0:an contingent of norad at malmstrom afb great falls montana in may 1983 we were impressed 
 by the tremendous affection shown to the canadian contingent by the civilians of that montana city this affection was displayed 
 by the appearance of 1600 people at the farewell concert in their honour at the great falls civic centre other 
 major ceremonial events which gave the band much exposure 0:expo 0:sure due to television coverage included the opening and closing 
 of the western canada games july august 83 the closing of the world scout jamboree july 83 the calgary stampede 
 parade july 83 and the world junior curling championships in medicine hat in march 83 one of the responsibilities of 
 a military band is its role as a public relations organization for the canadian forces in this capacity the band 
 had a highly successful year public and school concert tours were performed in the crowsnest kamloops kelowna williston north dakota 
 moose jaw cold lake medicine hat edmonton and calgary areas during the 1982 83 season the band feels that under 
 the guiding philosophy of the director of music captain ron swaneveld 0:swane 0:veld we have achieved a concert format and 
 programme unsurpassed 0:unsur 0:passed in general audience appeal in music entertainment is the name of the game the number of 
 standing ovations the band received 0:re 0:ceived would seem to indicate that energy drive and joyful musicmaking 0:music 0:making can 
 be accomplished without an attendant loss of military image the band s ability to perform a concert of military music 
 was ably demonstrated at the jubilee auditorium on 24 february 1983 in combination with the king s own calgary regiment 
 band and the pipers and dancers of the calgary highlanders an evening of martial 0:mar 0:tial splendour was presented that 
 appealed to all in attendance another 0:an 0:other two highlights were our evening performances at the kinsmen international band festival 
 in moose jaw and at the band days festival 0:fes 0:tival in williston north dakota a personal satisfaction for the 
 band was our production of the cfcn 60 minute television special fanfare we spent an arduous week taping the audio 
 portion at thunder roads studio calgary earlier in the year and then did the video segment over a week in 
 and around the banff springs hotel our acting debut proved educational 0:edu 0:cational often humourous and sometimes slightly terrifying the 
 special was aired on father s day 19 june 83 to very favourable public reaction to our knowledge this was 
 the first full length canadian 0:ca 0:nadian forces band special

 after visiting the troops in the field it was into camp for an all ranks luncheon this afforded the first 
 opportunity for members of the fourth battalion to mix with other patricias attending courses at the ppcli battle school in 
 wainwright the luncheon was a great success 0:suc 0:cess lady patricia specifically requested that the head table be a mixture 
 of all ranks from both the fourth battalion and the battle school in addition special care was taken to ensure 
 that the general seating was also mixed both by rank and by the two groups unfortunately the visit was over 
 too quickly after a short but very well received address by lady patricia it was time to return to the 
 airstrip 0:air 0:strip for the return flight to calgary and other duties the regimental band reborn for a number of 
 years now the regimental band has been a very small group for the last four years it has been so 
 small that it has had to parade jointly with the air reserve squadron in order to sound reasonable now that 
 has all changed step one was recruiting our own band master this was accomplished 0:accom 0:plished in june with the 
 enrolment of 2lt colin bonneau a fine musician 0:musi 0:cian in his own right mr bonneau spends his civilian time 
 teaching high school bands giving private lessons and playing the organ for his local church of course the army doesn 
 t do anything for the obvious reason a secondary plan in securing a band master that teaches high school was 
 gaining the inside track in attracting young new musicians this part of the plan has worked beyond everyones wildest dreams 
 within a month of mr bonneau s arrival he had recruited twenty grade twelve musicians from edmonton schools we had 
 so many people all at the same age and experience level that we were able to apply for and receive 
 permission to conduct a special seven week summer youth employment programme as a result we now have twenty new musicians 
 with their recruit and basic training complete the entire band accompanied the unit to milcon 83 in dundurn during august 
 this turned out to be a new experience for both the band and the staff at brigade headquarters during a 
 concert being given in the field for the retiring area commander the headquarters was attacked by a small enemy force 
 without hesitation the band downed instruments picked up their personal weapons drove off the enemy and returned to complete their 
 concert with this type of spirit the future looks good for the new band flowers for every occasion jhfil roselawn

 77 the royal green jackets ist battalion commanding officer lieutenant colonel cclo owen mvo obe the 1 st battalion has 
 now completed seventeen months of its two year tour in northern ireland life in this troubled province is rarely without 
 its chances and changes but we are used to this and were not surprised when this tour proved no exception 
 to the general rule for our first sixteen months until march 23 we operated in belfast 0:bel 0:fast deploying one 
 company in turn to our base in the northern part of the city from there we worked in close cooperation 
 with the royal ulster constabulary ruc but with particular responsibility for four republican areas notorious for sedition and terrorism in 
 march we exchanged belfast a grimy and unattractive place for the outwardly more pleasant rural country of fermanagh the south 
 westernmost country of the province whose boundary adjoins eire to the south and west in belfast our mission was to 
 support the ruc in the maintenance of law and order in the past few years the police have more and 
 more firmly taken over the lead in the battle against terrorism in northern ireland and the military have had to 
 become used to being in the passenger seat however we quickly adapted to this relationship fundamental as it is to 
 our joint success or failure and judging from the many public unsolicited testimonials we received from the ruc in belfast 
 and the fact that in our fourteen months in the city there was no significant terrorist activity in our patch 
 we would appear to have got it about right it had been a strange year in many ways especially for 
 old northern ireland hands it had been a frustrating and often incomprehensible 0:incom 0:prehensible year at the same time it 
 had been fun often exciting sometimes dangerous occasionally tragic and nearly always very rewarding we had had considerable operational success 
 having been involved in the arrest of several wanted terrorists and finding in our searches an impressive quality of terrorist 
 weapons ammunition and explosives christmas 1982 was marked by the usual round of parties and seasonal activities peculiar to a 
 battalion out of england and much enjoyed as these regimental christmases so often are the new year began quiet although 
 the list of atrocities in belfast and throughout the province continued to lengthen daily we continued our normal operations with 
 some small successes in terms of weapons 0:weap 0:ons and ammunition finds in march however the plan that our deployed 
 company should move to go under command 4th battalion the ulster defence regiment 0:regi 0:ment 4udr in rural fermanagh was 
 confirmed in some ways we were glad a change of operational area was likely to keep our riflemen 0:ri 0:flemen 
 on their toes provide them with a new environment of an entirely 0:en 0:tirely different character and get them off 
 the belfast streets which frankly had begun to pall the period leading up to a unit handover in belfast is 
 always the most dangerous for the ira like to try to kill soldiers by way of a parting present just 
 before a move there was no exception to the rule in this handover for on our very last night a 
 gunman fired on a patrol in the ardoyne a staunchly republican area the patrol commanded 0:com 0:manded by a lance 
 corporal returned the fire in a most spirited fashion but despite intense and immediate reaction we were unable to account 
 for this gunman in the middle of a comprehensive search operation following this incident we handed over our area of 
 tactical responsibility to ist battalion the royal highland fusiliers who are themselves no strangers to the street skirmish the new 
 countrified way of life for the deployed company has not much affected the main body of the battalion in aldergrove 
 although the longer lines of communication to the company in fermanagh and our new brigade 8 infantry brigade headquarters in 
 londonderry 0:london 0:derry present obvious administrative difficulties highlighted perhaps 0:per 0:haps when the battalion was stood to trained and ready 
 to go to fight fires in belfast where the fire services had threatened to strike in fermanagh the deployed company 
 is commander for operations 0:opera 0:tions by 4udr and is responsible for a large area the company headquarters and one 
 platoon operate from st angelo a somewhat dreary base beside lough erne and a few miles north of enniskillen the 
 country town a second platoon mans permanent vehicle check points on the legal road crossing points from the south and 
 a third is based in the republican market town of belleek right on the border 0:bor 0:der the routine in 
 fermanagh comprises vehicle checks long rural patrols and ambushes where terrorist activity is likely fermanagh is not without recent terrorist 
 activity three days before we took over the border post at mullen bridge was attacked by ira mortar fire fortunately 
 0:for 0:tunately without friendly forces casualties but unfortunately without loss to the enemy we can look back on a year 
 and a half s hard but often satisfying work with a sense of real achievement we can look forward to 
 a very different way of life and a new mission when we move to tidworth in southern england in november 
 there we joint 1 infantry brigade which has a baor reinforcement role training for european warfare 0:war 0:fare will be 
 different demanding and fun the spur to our training will be the knowledge that we need to get it right 
 for the falkland islands 0:is 0:lands for which we have been warned for november 1984 it seems unlikely that the 
 year to come will be dull in any way and the battalion 0:bat 0:talion which is in the very best 
 of heart looks forward to it with a sense of real anticipation car stereo vg specialists 
 78 2nd battalion commanding officer lieutenant colonel jpo beddard mbe once again a year seems to have flown past leaving 
 us all wondering 0:wonder 0:ing what on earth happened to it the events of last july seem to have taken 
 place only yesterday and yet trying to place everything in sequence the impression is of a gap of years not 
 months july 82 saw the battalion recovering its mechanised skills after our spell in west belfast we were to learn 
 later in the year that our successes in that four month period had been recognised by the award of an 
 mm six mids and 8 gos s commendations which was a small consolation after the tragic ending of our tour 
 when we lost three riflemen in an ira ambush only a day and a half before they were to return 
 home in the dust of soltau training area as we prepared 0:pre 0:pared for a trip to the british army 
 training unit suffield batus in canada the streets of west belfast seemed very far away batus is an annoying place 
 on your first visit the small base camp that is activated annually to receive seven battlegroups from baor for three 
 weeks of intensive mechanised training perches on the edge of a vast training area a small british staff administer and 
 supervise training for the battlegroups who after settling in and taking 0:tak 0:ing over vehicles drive wide eyed onto the 
 prairie to manoeuvre and exercise with live ammunition the scale of the range area allows freedom of manoeuvre virtually at 
 will and the ability to practice live firing battlegroup attacks in which all arms are able to play their part 
 is one of the great benefits of travelling so far to train most welcome change more of the barracks is 
 now being modernised 0:modern 0:ised but it will not be finally up to scale in our time here for interest 
 of the reader our orbat is now a headquarter company three mechanised 0:mech 0:anised rifle companies and a support company 
 of a mortar and milan 0:mi 0:lan platoon some 650 ranks in total 1983 has so far seen us busy 
 with low level training getting our personal skills back up to standard after a year in which the need to 
 concentrate on platoon and company level manoeuvres did not allow us to practise them sufficiently we have trained in soltau 
 in the snow in denmark and france we have our annual field firing and mechanised training to come and we 
 are already looking to 1984 and our programme for that year it promises again to be busy with another trip 
 to canada and a major 1 br corps exercise we cannot end without mentioning our change of commanding officer lt 
 col mike robertson has left us and returned to england handing over to lt col jon beddard to steer us 
 through the next two years we look forward to seeing as many of our affiliated regiments as we can on 
 our way the 2 rgj battlegroup comprised two mechanized companies mortar and milan sections of our own with our battalion 
 headquarters and echelon to command and support us our cavalry came from the life guards and our engineers gunners aviation 
 section transport and medics from a variety of sources in baor it was not until we arrived in batus that 
 we all met up and it is a measure of the effectiveness 0:effec 0:tiveness of the training and the potential 
 of the area that at the end of three weeks we were an operational and battle ready force everyone 0:every 
 0:one thoroughly enjoyed their time on the prairie with its abundance of wildlife and the vagaries of climate that left 
 you hopeful in your shirt sleeves but certainly ensuring your parka was never far away after a period of four 
 days leave in canada during which the battlegroup 0:bat 0:tlegroup scattered itself between san francisco and vancouver enjoying 0:en 0:joying 
 the different life styles of north america we returned to minden our task was to ready ourselves for a major 
 exercise in which we were to test our ability to absorb and then counter attack against a major armoured offensive 
 after life firing in canada it all seemed a little tame but nevertheless a lot of lessons were learnt it 
 was a tired and dirty battalion that drove back to barracks at the end to set about cleaning up before 
 taking biock leave the three weeks block leave went all too fast and on return it was almost christmas we 
 completed our annual personal weapons test at sennelager and then entered the season of parties and carols during 0:dur 0:ing 
 which the wives club entertained us all with a superb show the singing dancing and acting talents of a host 
 of previously unknown stars were revealed to all and much appreciated so we entered the new year and began by 
 reorganising ourselves and adjusting the accommodation plot within our barracks two companies took over a modernised barrack block that houses 
 the riflemen in flats some twelve men including jnco s live in these flats which have their own bathroom washing

 79 3rd battalion commanding officer lieutenant colonel cbq wallace obe the battalion is now firmly established in trenchard barracks in 
 celle and at the time of writing has just completed its first year in germany it has to be said 
 inevitably that the year has been extremely 0:ex 0:tremely busy the military commitments have been such that both our sporting 
 achievements and our more reputable socialising have suffered however no matter all will doubtless be put to rights in the 
 next twelve months our arrival in germany has also enabled us to see considerably more of the 2nd battalion both 
 their officers and sergeants mess have come up from minden to spend weekends with us in celle another 0:an 0:other 
 visitor was our colonel commandant field marshal sir edwin bramall who came to see us last summer he came at 
 a rather more pleasant time of year than the secretary of state for defence michael 0:mi 0:chael heseltine who braved 
 the snow and cold of sennelager in february to watch and i am told participate in the battalion s field 
 firing the winter months saw a series of cadres being run while of those not involved many were able to 
 get away adventure training with the ski hut in steibis being particularly in demand our adventure training 0:train 0:ing expert 
 csgt ross ashe cregan had been on an army expedition to the annapurna area of nepal earlier in the year 
 along with rfn beaton of r company he spent much of the winter planning the battalion s 0:bat 0:talion 0:s 
 expedition to the jotuheim area of norway which is due to take place this september the battalion s training in 
 1983 has been largely aimed at our visit to canada in june and july of this year on exercise medicine 
 man training began early with field firing in february platoon training culminating 0:cul 0:minating in the tarleton trophy competition won 
 by sgt bob west s surveillance platoon in march and the annual weapon classification of the entire battalion in april 
 the pre medicine man battle group exercises were conducted on soltau in late may and as i write this in 
 mid june so the first flight leaves for canada a company are already 0:al 0:ready out in canada participating in 
 the previous exercise to our own as part of the infantry support for the royal hussars the battalion has had 
 some success in competition both military and sporting during the year the bugle platoon in their role as the sf 
 machine gun platoon won the baor concentration and came 3rd in the army while the ski team won the divisional 
 competition and came sth in the army meet captain crospin beattie won the divisional 0:di 0:visional tennis competition our other 
 sporting achievements have been relatively modest but accomplished as they were with an almost 0:al 0:most total lack of training 
 auger well for next year when we hopefully 0:hopeful 0:ly will have a little more time sgt vince halpin s 
 boxing team csgt jim rock s cross country team captain roy stanger s rugby team captain christopher faulkner s athletic 
 team and captain richard carrow s cross country ski team have all made a good start in the highly competitive 
 world of baor sport the battalion has seen a series of changes within the hierarchy over the last year lt 
 colonel christopher wallace took over from lt colonel roger ker in april while a few months before wol rod le 
 couilliard took over as rsm from wol mick gleeson the last year has been both busy and interesting for the 
 battalion an enormous amount has been learnt and achieved and we are now rather more at home in our mechanised 
 role we all hope that the next twelve months will see a rather more settled period and thus allow 0:al 
 0:low us to appreciate more the delights of germany 4th battalion commanding officer lieutenant colonel cjp miers july started off 
 with c company providing a guard of honour at the guildhall for the prime minister of singapore lee kwan yu 
 when he was given the freedom of the city of london captain tony asquith and lieutenant dick hudson and twenty 
 six members of c company took part july always tends to be a busy month and as well as normal 
 company 0:com 0:pany training c g and hq companies ran a joint escape and evasion 0:eva 0:sion exercise at thetford 
 this is rapidly becoming an annual event and this year the success of the exercise was largely due to the 
 work and preparation put into it by major andrew wells and lieutenant roger foister of c company august was a 
 comparatively quiet month for the companies which included spi block leave and company commander baor recce however at battalion headquarters 
 life was at fever pitch preparing for camp mull was an unusual camp in that it was totally unsupported by 
 any army camp or ministry of defence administrative facilities this put a considerable burden on our quartermaster john beerman who 
 together 0:to 0:gether with the advance party worked a series of logistic miracles seemingly out of nowhere fully equipped tented 
 company camps sprang up complete with electric light heaters and nearly all modern conveniences much of the success of camp 
 was due to john s efforts 0:ef 0:forts without canvas there can be no picture and certainly on mull no 
 camp we were a trifle unlucky with the weather which tended to clear up only when senior officers visited us 
 despite the weather a great deal of useful training was carried out over excellent infantry terrain companies were based in 
 company camps at strategic points on the estate however they were close enough together so that they could all be 
 reached on foot from battalion 0:bat 0:talion headquarters and companies were able to link up for joint exercises during the 
 first week this of course reduced the need to use transport d company under neil johnson was the most far 
 away and were located on the next door farm getting to them involved 0:in 0:volved a walk and a short 
 voyage in the colonel s own inflatable boat we were fortunate to get two wessex helicopters for a day to 
 help us with our training they flew over from northern ireland and our thanks go to 1 rgj who helped 
 to liaise with the raf graham mckinley a former training major even came over with the helicopters 0:helicopt 0:ers and 
 spent the day with us with the falklands uppermost in everyone s mind it was perhaps not surprising that the 
 battalion exercise involved some fairly extensive 0:exten 0:sive cross country approach marches through peat bogs and that the enemy was 
 hispantina rather than the usual fantasian heavies the final objective was an ancient celtic castle by the sea below glengorm 
 november saw c company once again taking part in the lord mayor of london s show and all companies involved 
 in the remembrance 0:remem 0:brance sunday services we also had our annual dinner in the goldsmith s 0:gold 0:smith 0:s 
 hall on which occasion we were most honoured to have field marshal sir edwin bramall to address us in december 
 the co training major and company commanders attended the 1 div study period in verden a most interesting and worthwhile 
 experience since his arrival in 4 rgj colonel christopher 0:christo 0:pher has made a number of important changes the anti 
 tank platoon 0:pla 0:toon is now concentrated entirely at oxford and the mortar platoon likewise at wenlock street davies street 
 has been given a much needed facelift the entrance hall staircase and club have been repainted 0:re 0:painted and generally 
 smartened up many of the pictures have been rehung and spot lighted and more pictures have been imported from other 
 drill halls notably kaiser william ii from fulham 1983 continues to be as busy as 1982 in january and february 
 the companies concentrated on their shooting and training their teams 0:tea 0:ms for the 1983 courage trophy which was held

 80 the light division depot commanding officer lieutenant colonel pg chamberlain the last year at the depot has been one 
 of change we changed our title our role and our orbat as from 1 january 1983 we ceased to be 
 called the rifle depot and became the light division depot winchester with the light infantry depot becoming the light division 
 0:divi 0:sion depot shrewsbury both depots now train a mixture of green jackets and light infantrymen winchester training the division 
 s adult recruits while shrewsbury looks after the junior soldiers and houses the junior band and bugles the change of 
 title is not contract 0:con 0:tract to some opinion a dark and sinister plot to amalgamate the two regiments but 
 is instead a rationalisation of training once the new barracks is complete at flowerdown outside winchester the juniors will move 
 down and the two depots will form one training all green jacket and light infantry recruits the creation of the 
 divisional depot has gone remarkably smoothly 0:smooth 0:ly with only the occasional flutter as we forget to call light infantrymen 
 0:infantry 0:men privates instead of riflemen and there has been much discussion 0:dis 0:cussion over flags and plaque designs the 
 aim is for the permanent staff to be half light infantry and half green jackets and we are well on 
 the way with the commanding officer 0:of 0:ficer and regimental sergeant major lieutenant colonel chamberlin 0:chamber 0:lin rgj and wol 
 taylor li training company too has an equal split with green jacket company commander major smythe rgj light infantry training 
 officer captain bacon li and equal members of platoon staff from each regiment we now have four training teams that 
 form up with platoons on a six week cycle and we will soon have a fifth team that will help 
 in training the ta running brecon phase one courses and so on after 1982 which was a lean year for 
 recruits 1983 is certainly a year of plenty and platoons are forming up with as many as seventy recruits giving 
 corporals the chance to command sections almost as big as normal platoons we have been delighted to see a number 
 of distinguished guests take our passing out parades including major general sibbald lieutenant general sir roland guy the mayor of 
 winchester and rear admiral hunt the most recent parade was taken by lieutenant colonel 0:lieuten 0:ant 0:colonel peter petra who 
 retired after 37 years in the regiment as he marched back to the saluting dais after the inspection he was 
 somewhat surprised to see a further rank of old contemptibles lined up consisting of most of his past commanding officers 
 colonel 0:colo 0:nel peter s inspection was followed by an impressive lunch and send off in the quartermaster s department 
 trailer behind the band playing auld lang syne we look forward to the move to flowerdown sometime in 1986 but 
 it will be sad to leave peninsula barracks which has been the regimental 0:regi 0:mental home since 1858 the new 
 barracks sound impressive and will be custom built for training so should provide a good new home for the light
