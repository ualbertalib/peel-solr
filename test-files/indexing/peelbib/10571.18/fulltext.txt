 have already been made and with a year s experience behind them the team is now pointing for that final 
 game in 1957 in the dominion day track and field meet at dortmund we placed second to the rcr in 
 a meet which saw all but two of last year s 1 cdn inf bde records broken our team set 
 new records in the 400 m and 1600 m relay while pte lunde c company set a new broad jump 
 record with a leap of 19 5v2 outstanding 0:out 0:standing athletes on the track team were pte leighton c company

 team completely dominated 0:domi 0:nated the track events while a company athletes led by 2 lt watson and pte ulm 
 showed up very well in the field events the softball trophy was won by hq company with a team composed 
 mainly of the signal platoon they had to overcome the stubborn resistance 0:re 0:sistance of a company to take the 
 honours c company with their two stars zoboski and muszynski 0:mus 0:zynski and capt h moncrief won the volleyball competition 
 eliminating 0:eliminat 0:ing a company in the final match a company s tug of war team coached by 2 lt 
 g meloche and captained by l cpl hathaway pulled all comers around the sports field to win the tug of 
 war cup the soccer team got off to a shaky start losing their opening game 3 1 to the rcr 
 but under the steadying 0:steady 0:ing hand of sgt vallance sp company 0:com 0:pany they improved greatly and lost only 
 one more game this to 1 fd sqn rce by a score of 5 3 at sennelager the team ended 
 the season with a record of 10 wins and 2 losses which placed us third in the 13 team bde 
 league behind the rcr and rce who tied for first place the team s outstanding player was centre forward pte

 soccer final provided very keen competition when a company and d company 0:com 0:pany met the first final game played 
 in a downpour after three 10 minute overtime periods was drawn 2 2 and forced another final to be played 
 after a two week lapse the two companies went at it again and a company came from behind to defeat 
 d company 3 1 and win the soccer cup our softball team though adeptly handled by 2 lt a sim 
 c company 0:com 0:pany and sgt camponi b company 0:com 0:pany has just completed a dismal season unable to practice 
 regularly 0:regu 0:larly because of almost continuous westphalian dew and forced to play on diamonds that resembled sloughs the team 
 only won one game and lost 5 to finish in the cellar of the major units league there were some 
 bright spots however 0:how 0:ever in the fine catching of sgt thurn d company and the steady pitching of pte 
 bird b company and pte leclair a company at the present time there are two events to run off the 
 brigade tennis tournament and the brigade cross country run in both the battalion has strong teams and we have not 
 given up hope of winning the brigade grand aggregate trophy if we don t win it then wait till next 
 year activities in the officers mess since our last look at mess activities 0:activi 0:ties in february many interesting and 
 memorable events have taken place the week end of the colonel in chief s birthday was its usual tremendous 0:tre 
 0:mendous success with a mess dinner 0:din 0:ner on the 16th a broom i 100 game 
 the patrician 16 on the morning of the 17th officers and sergeants party afterwards and a formal ball in the 
 evening all the regimental officers from the brigade attended the mess dinner and official guests from baor units were invited 
 to the ball decorations 0:decora 0:tions though simple were in keeping 0:keep 0:ing with the theme and excellent music was 
 provided by the rc sigs band little need be said about the broom i 100 game a comment by one 
 of the local inhabitants sitting in the stands it looks like a roman arena summed it up nicely the melee 
 ended in a tie as did the party afterwards april was relatively quiet in comparison 0:com 0:parison but a very 
 enjoyable dinner dance 0:din 0:ner 0:dance was held our big month of course was may and in every way it 
 was a great success the trooping was held over the 14th 15th and 16th beginning with the traditional mess dinner 
 the mess dinner was an impressive 0:impres 0:sive occasion and our new silver candelabra cutlery and table mats certainly complimented 
 a fine dinner 0:din 0:ner the trooping ball was beyond all expectations picture the huge tent filling the parking area 
 coloured lights thousands of streamers and other fascinating decorations a generous portion of the signals band and of course the 
 beautiful gowns of the ladies with their escorts in formal military dress from different nations and different services all this 
 combined with a fifty foot long buffet fit for kings made the evening a truly magnificent 0:magni 0:ficent occasion not 
 to be forgotten scon after the trooping we were off to sennelager for a couple of weeks and until the 
 end of june the mess took a breather while many officers were on leave on 29 jun a dominion day 
 dance was held bolstered by the menden quintet a few of the younger fellows provided a bit of tomfoolery and

 the patrician 28 the rifle brigade regimental marches the riile brigade tm ninety five this is the regimental quick step 
 of the rifle brigade it was arranged 0:ar 0:ranged for march tempo from an old song by the music master 
 of the first battalion in 1842 the original words were i m ninety five i m ninety five and to 
 keep single i ll contrive it s pins and needles needles and pins for when a man marries his trouble 
 begins it proved very popular with all ranks and was adopted as the official 0:of 0:ficial regimental march in 1852 
 prior to this date the huntsmen s chorus from the opera der freishutz 0:frei 0:shutz was the quick step the 
 tune of ninety five was a great favorite of her majesty queen victoria so much so that other regiments began 
 to encroach commenting on this in 1868 the ccmmander in chief hrh the duke of cambridge said i have always 
 desired the discontinuance of such a practice and i hope the gallant rifles will not have cause to complain 0:com 
 0:plain again in this respect whenever 0:when 0:ever it is represented to me that other corps adopt the march i 
 will stop it at once over the hills and far away the bugle horn regimental quick step in use in 
 the rifle brigade since about 1805 the tune is an air from the beggar s opera the march is invariably 
 played by the buglers immediately before the band strikes up i m ninetyfive 0:ninety 0:five the duke oi connaught this 
 is a slow march composed by hrh princess beatrice and presented 0:pre 0:sented by her to the rifle brigade to 
 celebrate the appointment of hrh the duke of connaught as colonel in chief in 1880 
 the patrician 29 this appears most unusual as the slow march does not form part of the rifle brigade ceremonial 
 the regiment has however marched past in slow time the last recorded occasion being in ireland in 1881 moneymusk the 
 regimental double march used when doubling past in close column of companies it s composer is unknown but the melody 
 is a well known highland air among the men selected to form the corps of riflemen in 1801 were no

 infantry in retrospect the training year was a good one with the emphasis 0:em 0:phasis at summer camp on individual 
 0:indi 0:vidual training the regiment was able to qualify a number of nco s and men in specialist weapons strength 
 remained at approximately 0:approxi 0:mately the same level as the previous year a fact that is causing 0:caus 0:ing some 
 concern from a militia standpoint both nationally and locally it seems that canada with a magnificent military record in two 
 world wars is plagued with a militia recruiting problem that at times seems unsurmountable the regiment is in some respects 
 no different from many other militia units we say in some respects justifiably because the strength in out of town 
 sub units is satisfactory 0:satisfac 0:tory in the city c company and headquarters company continued 0:con 0:tinued to function satisfactorily 
 c company was again given the training role for 23 militia group recruits three complete recruit courses were ably conducted 
 by major keith wakefield assisted by lieutenants bernie stanton george nesbit jim harrison jack fleming and officer cadet geoff sainty 
 these officers carried out their duties with an enthusiam that was hard to beat assistant instructors were csm williams sergeants

 administration efficiently lt col r a bradburn ed took a very active part in the regiment s activities during the 
 year he carried 0:car 0:ried out inspections of all out oftown 0:out 0:of 0:town sub units a feat that involves 
 a fair amount of travelling by everything but dog team his enthusiasm 0:en 0:thusiasm helped a great deal colonel bradburn 
 believes the recruiting 0:re 0:cruiting problem can be licked if everyone works at it the band has new dress uniforms 
 0:uni 0:forms worn for the first time at the edmonton exhibition parade many favourable comments have been received from friends 
 and strangers instrument work fully matches sartorial 0:sar 0:torial elegance and the band has been busy playing for various unit 
 functions and militia group parades the band played to an audience of over 1 000 persons at griesbach during the 
 summer and held several concerts in various city parks the regiment is grateful for the advice given in connection with 
 the uniforms by major munro and captain gardner of ppcli depot there must be something that captain gardner doesn t 
 know about military uniforms but heaven knows what it is the modelling and dress reviews that preceded the manufacture of 
 the uniforms would have done credit to dior in all his glory summer camp at wainwright a phrase that somehow 
 seems to hold terror for the uniniated was very successful training was conducted on an individual basis recruits took advanced 
 infantry training and whilst they probably sweated a lot they also learned a lot officers not employed regimentally went out 
 on tewt s a nerve wrecking experience that is inclined to show how little one really knows all in all 
 everyone kept busy and came away feeling that camp had been really worthwhile now that the winter is before us 
 we have an opportunity of passing on the knowledge gained to the 1956 crop of recruits and of adding to 
 it for the inevitable promotion exams that will come with the spring socially the summer was successful 0:success 0:ful the 
 ye day ball in may provided 0:pro 0:vided a very pleasant evening for all who attended this function seems to 
 grow from strength to strength and we were again happy to see several friends from the depot with their ladies 
 several saturday 0:satur 0:day evenings at camp harris were enlivened by regimental parties the regimental picnic was held at camp 
 harris following thegoc s inspection in june a function that always meets with popular approval 0:ap 0:proval the sergeants mess 
 held several gatherings at camp harris the furnishings in the sergeants mess at camp harris would put any self respecting 
 country club to shame the work done by the faithful few in the last three years is at last beginning 
 to pay off as we go forward into another year none of us know what is in store for us 
 we all know that it will not be an easy one if we can keep our enthusiasm in the face 
 of adversity we can cope with anything we can justly be proud of the regimental traditions and from those traditions 
 we can draw strength in times of stress
