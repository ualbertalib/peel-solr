 by helen boyd edited by t a crowley helen boyd the author of these reminis or three tents together there
 was a lot of cences was born in edmonton in 1905 her furniture in that tent and bright rugs on
 the floors father j r boyle was a prominent liberal where we played with the little boys who lived politician
 who entered the legislature in 1905 there when i was old enough to appreciate such and became minister of education
 in 1912 things i realized we had been playing on oriental attorney general six years later and justice of rugs
 and antique mahogony furniture that the the supreme court ofalberta in 1924 her moth thorns had brought from scotland er
 dora shaw came from high river and mar the boyles bought several properties and buildned boyle in 1902 mrs boyle
 was active in ings during this period of spectacular growth but edmonton social circles and in women s groups they
 held on too long andfailed to realize any profits before the boom went bust with the coming of the war
 such as the wctu and local council ofwomen j r boyle was really more interested in his thriving in these
 memoirs mrs boyd provides a legal practice than real estate speculation glimpse of growing up in an influential edmon one
 of the last pieces of property father let go ton political family early in the 20 th centur y was
 a three storey apartment block perhaps he despite the prosperity the boy es attained they held on to this brick
 building for sentimental remained close to their rural roots boom and reasons as he had named it the lambton bust
 war and disease made an impact on this block after the ontario county where he was couple and their three
 children helen fred and born at first he found it hard to believe that the jean as well as on
 less fortunate families rents were not enough to pay the taxes as he mrs boyd lived in edmonton until 1930
 and thought the agent was mismanaging it mother worked as a reporter for the edmonton journal took it over and
 managed it for a year but she and the edmonton bulletin she later workedfor too found that rents had fallen
 so low that the the regina daily star following her marriage income on the block was insufficient to pay the
 to hugh boyd she moved to winnipeg and then taxes and so it went to ottawa where she died in
 980 mother did manage to save two lots she had bought on speculation one had a little house on it
 that she rented to a good tenant for enough to in edmonton all the hotels nd boarding pay the taxes
 the other was a vacant lot on the houses were full as there were no houses to outskirts of the
 city on namayo avenue as rent most newcomers had to spend their first father didn t want to lose that
 lot he kept paying winter in a tent our house on ninth street was the taxes on it part of
 the lot had been cleared the only one in that block the rest was all bush and mother had a
 man plant potatoes there beexcept where three families had put up tents on cause she was never quite satisfied with
 the their lots white canvas was erected over a potatoes she bought at the mrket the ga rdener wooden floor
 with lumber siding up three feet hilled the rows during the summer and then one the tent was heated by
 a wood or coal stove and saturday in september we children had the fun where the stove pipe came through
 he top there of helping to dig them this was a festive occawas an extra patch of canvas for insulation
 even with this precaution there were often fires in the tents i ta crowley is a member of the history
 depart i ment university of guelph his comments are in ithe family next door to us had a very large
 italics square tent with partitions or possibly it was two i sion when we had a picnic and a bonfire
 on the fiance when he decided to enlist he was in the vacant lot once i dug a huge potato
 with a lot of first group of canadians sent to train in england little ones attached i took a picture
 of it with my the training camp was on salisbury plains a box brownie and sent it to my uncle
 hugh who low area in southern england that didn t drain was always saying that things were bigger in properly
 when it rained it rained a lot the first calgary one day after mother figured out how year of the
 war and many of the canadian solmuch the potatoes were costing a bushel she diers were soon ill helen brand
 currie s huspersuaded father to stop paying taxes so the lot band was one of the many who died of
 pneumo went to the city and father started growing nia on salisbury plains to the growing hatred potatoes at the
 garden he had at the lake against germany was added the resentment a the first school i went to was
 a private one gainst britain for sending canadians to salisbury only two blocks from home and operated by an plains
 englishwoman miss geach i was just begin jack pateman was almost like an older brother fling to love miss geach
 s school when mother to fred and me because he spent summers with told me i would have to leave
 it and start at the us at the lake running the motor launch and large mckay avenue school four blocks
 away bringing in water wood and ice when he was when i objected mother explained that she and only seventeen
 he managed to enlist after he father wanted me to go to mckay avenue be was wounded he had a
 leave at his mother s cause it was a public school she said that home in edmonton and we were
 fascinated by premier sifton had asked father to go into his his stories that brought the war close after his
 cabinet as minister of education in charge of leave he went back overseas to serve on a public schools i
 knew who premier sifton was hospital ship but on one of its trans atlantic a nice man who lived in
 the next block and wore crossings it was sunk by the germans for weeks a long black persian lamb coat
 in winter but i we kept hoping that jack would be found as a resented having to change to another
 school survivor but he wasn t from then on conversation at home was often although we couldn t picture the
 war we about alberta schools and mother having been a were sensitive to stories of german atrocities teacher always had
 plenty to say i remember especially stories of german soldiers killing belgoing occasionally with mother to the legisla gian children
 when we repeated these stories at ture and seeing that the other members thought home father would remark that in
 war both sides the department of education and the minister commit atrocities i suppose i picked up these were important
 stories at our little knitting group once a week when we studied the bugle boy or other the girls in
 our class stayed after four p m to knit martial poems in our readers at school we really socks and
 pack parcels for overseas i wasn t didn understa nd them because we didn t know good at knitting so
 i was glad when it was my about war our elders never talked about war as turn to read aloud
 bab a sub deb i don t they have done since 1914 the outbreak of war know why we chose
 that particular mary roberts was something beyond our understanding but rhinehart book because bab was a wealthy our parents dismay
 stamped the day in our american girl and we didn t like americans memories on august 4 1914 we were
 out at the because they were making a lot of money out of lake where it had been raining for
 several days the war while remaining neutral our little the brown clay roads were impassable and knitting group talked a
 lot about german spies father was happily marooned there with us everyone with a german accent was suspect when the
 wor st of the storm was over someone father said that all the germans he knew had came across the
 lake in a boat from the village of become loyal canadians and anyway the british wabamun with a telephone message
 that war had the best spy system in the world we found had been declared that hard to believe the
 first of our family friends to go to war a small munitions factory was started in edwere young english irish
 and scottish reservists monton and every thought was of the war yet who hurried east to get the first boat
 that would the british still looked on canada as a colony takethemtobritiantoserveinthearmyornavy this was brought home to us at a
 concert at as soon as recruiting depots were set up young convocation hall at the university where the canadians enlisted
 one of mother s young cou chief entertainer was harry lauder the comesins who often came to our house married
 her dian from glasgow it was the first time that the j r boyle family were prominent members of edmonton
 shortly after the turn of the century above are mr and mrs boyle and their children fred and helen the
 latter being the author of the reminiscences mother and father had taken us out at night to a dered to
 read this directive from their pulpits grown up affair and we loved harry lauder s shortly before election day songs
 with his wiggle waggle wiggle of the when the directive was read one sunday in kilt unfortunately he didn t
 stop with the mr munns church in calgary he stood up in songs he had lost his only son in
 the wa r and he his pew and challenged the right of both the concluded by giving a lecture urging
 the cob minister and the head of the methodist church to nials to be more loyal to the mother country
 the instruct the congregation on political matters chairman of the concert was dr mcqueen the mr munns knew his church
 history the cohpioneer minister of first presbyterian church who had also lost a son at the front in the gregation
 was stunned it was as if mr munns had challenged the lord god almightly himself audience wer e ma ny
 other scots and canadians who had suffered casualties within their frequent contagions and highmortalitv rates were constant reminders of the
 fragilite of life in canada lies well into the 20 th century mrs boyd s grandfather in the bitter federal
 election of 19 7 j r boyle had died ear v in life and left afamily often children stood with
 edmonton cabinet minister frank oliver in ontario an aunt and uncle had also died young svho supported the laurier liberals
 in their oppo while her older twill sisters had not survived long sition to conscription after birth the influenza epidemic
 that hit edmonton in 9 8 was one of the worst scourges to afflict the around our house there was
 always a sense of ci 0 hundreds died within a few months including excitement at election time even by elections
 two of mrs boyd s relatives who were physicans antibotics had not yet been discovered and people provided father with
 new amusing stories to re relied on folk remedies some of which were effective late to mother at the dinner
 table fred and i within li nits the cure described below has also used absorbed a lot of political lore
 but it wasn t b the turks during world war one much use to us at school because none of
 our school mates was interested in politics during everyone had home remedies they gathered the wartime election of 19171 hadn
 t noticed that herbs such as bergamot and sage they grew things had changed until one day one of the
 girls hops for poultices as well as yeast for bread in our class was talking in an excited manner making
 they didn t know anything about disand denounced me as a pea soup at other infection then my aunt clara
 wrote to me times i had been called carrots which i had but my mother had a cure for everything
 childto accept because of my red hair and freckles but ren were always having felons and ring around i sensed
 that pea soup was even more dero infection on their knuckles mother did down a gatory and had something to
 do with the elec lot of perserves and sometimes a jar would go tion at home father explained what a
 pea mouldy she would take this mould and wrap it soup was he said it was a slang expression for
 around the sore and it really would cure it the french canadians of quebec they were smallpox was a word
 that brought fea r terror opposed to conscription and now the tories and pity to the old timers it had
 wiped out bands were using the phrase for all the liberals who of indians and the early settlers had reasons
 to were against compulsory service and who were fear it i remember two or three prominent oldstaying with sir wilfrid
 laurier father was one timers who were pockmarked and once on a of these streetcar i remember seeing a young
 woman the west had attracted men of physical cour whose cruelly scarred face still haunts me she age and father
 had many stories about brave old must have been overlooked when vaccinations timers however after 1917 mr munns came to
 were done because vaccinations were early be for him the bravest man i ve ever known made compulsory upon entering
 school father the story of mr munns bravery went back to was particularly adamant about vaccination and the election of
 1917 the roman catholic when he heard of outbreaks of smallpox in the church campaigned openly for the liberals but
 foreign settlements he was indignant that immiat first the protestant churches remained neutral grants had been able to get into
 the country following their tradition of the separation of without being vaccinated church and state that was particularly strong in
 when it came time for my young sister to be the west then shortly before the election the vaccinated there
 was a fad at the school to have head of the methodist church in toronto sent out girls vaccinated on
 their thighs to avoid having a directive to methodists to vote for the union the scar on the arm i
 put on a campaign for this government local methodist ministers were or pointing out how perfectly dreadful it was to
 with the outbreak of world war one many canadians and british settlers in the west volunteered for service above the
 corps of frontiersmen parades in edmonton in 1914 note the men not yet been issued with uniforms have the effect
 of a beautiful ball gown spoiled during the epidemic mother kept us children by an ugly scar father thought the
 situation was strictly isolated at home but after things were exactly the opposite when i go to a ball don
 t getting back to normal and the schools had startlook at a women s dress or even her ankles i
 ed fred caught it mother in her anxiety to just look to see that she has a good healthy protect
 me sent me off fo r two weeks to live vaccination on her arm with a friend near victoria high
 school she was then came the spanish influenza we hadn t a dear close friend who made me feel at
 home heard of flu before people just got colds al but i was terribly homesick though it was known that
 colds were contagious father had a stable built behind the house on there hadn t been an epidemic whole families
 ninth street he bought a jersey cow and hired a were struck down sometimes there wouldn t be man to
 come twice a day to milk and look after it anyone in the family well enough to attend to the
 when my twin sisters died the doctor had furnace or stoves doctors worked around the thought it was because of
 contamination in the clock visiting their patients at home soon the daiy milk seven years later when we moved to
 hospitals were filled and emergency hospitals the new house on seventh street father had the were set up the one
 i remember was in pembina stable and the cow moved there so there was safe hall at the university volunteer
 nurses worked milk for me and my brother when the city there and in private homes neighbors went in to
 health department finally prohibited cows being keep the fires going kept in town the little jersey was sold everyone wore
 white cheesecloth masks or at mother was almost fanatical about health least everyone was supposed to but father concerned about
 pure milk nourishing food and wouldn t soon there were so many doctors sick keeping diseases from us it was
 sometimes a that general orders were issued in the newpaper nuisance but we understood that it was due to telling
 people to take to bed if they contracted the death of the twins with the sale of the flu patients
 were also advised to take whiskey or jersey mother had to buy milk from the dairy rum but i doubt
 if that was printed in the paper she studied the dairy situation in edmonton and from staying in bed for
 so long without getting joined the crusade just started by the local up to eat many people developed pneumonia council
 of women to have cows tested for t b then a fatal disease eventually one of the dairies agreed to
 keep one of the herds t b free the milk from these cows yes suh but we calls our church
 cobohed was handled separately and delivered in bottles emma maintained that had a special cardboard cap over the top so
 on the form coloured was entered even if the bottle delivered by a man with t b beside religion the
 milk inside would not be contaminated al another coloured girl replied to an adverthough this milk sold at a higher
 price mother tisement for domestic help after i had seen her i and her friends in the local council were
 able to said to my father that she didn t look like a negro buy it but they were not
 satisfied because most even though she had kinky hair father laughed people still had to buy milk which carried t
 b and said she was one of the athabasca negroes germs eventually the compulsory testing of who had come from
 oklahoma those who had cows for 1 b and general pasteurization made made it to oklahoma in the slave days
 were free milk safe for everyone and they had mixed with indians this accounted emma who became our cook had
 been born for her fine indian features a narrow nose thin a slave she had a lot and a small
 house on it on lips and straight kinky hair when she became the south side of the city where she
 lived from our maid she demurred at wearing a cap because time to time she had originally come to canada
 it would not sit straight on her hair her name with a small group of coloured people who was los
 angeles jones guests were always sursettled at junkins west of edmonton prised to hear her called angeles mrs henri emma
 was a mulatto but much prouder of her etta muirl edwards pronounced it as though it black ancestry than her
 white she never missed were an evening prayer my mother thought it a an opportunity to point out the good
 qualities of pretty name but it did seem odd to me negro race her life in the united states had
 my parents had four or five dinners for membeen very unhappy but her better fortunes since bers of the legislature
 each session there wer e coming to alberta made her very pro british usually ten guests though not all couples
 since and she wrote a lot of poetry in praise of her many of the members wives did not come
 to adopted country edmonton for the session still mother always during world war one the dominion govern managed mixed parties
 as father loathed stag n ent sent out a questionnaire which everyone affairs wives visiting the city for a few
 weeks had to answer for an official registration emma cabinet members and their spouses and friends asked father for help
 in completing the form made the difference when it came to nationality emma promptly dinners were held right after the
 house rose at answered british subject father doubted six and ver y often some of the guests would this walk
 up the hill to our house with my father the but emma you were born in the united house always
 seemed to have a special gay at states mosphere on these occasions probably because yes suh all four fireplaces were
 burning at the same time they weren t necessary for heat but mother and your parents were american thought they
 added something and they did as yes suh you came in the front hall you were welcomed by and have
 you been naturalized the fire you could see burning in the den the no suh men left their coats in
 the vestibule many of then you must be an american citizen them wore fur coats beaver or raccoon or they
 were furbined with muskrat instead the women no no mr roberts she said proudly took their fur wraps upstairs in
 my parents i se a british subject room the fire was burning too and you could see so british subject
 was put on the registration the reflection all around as they had two large form wardrobes with long mirror doors
 all the when it came to religion emma was just as woodwork in the room and the wardrobes were determined
 mahogany and at night it seemed a beautiful my religion is cobohed she explained shade but the government is asking
 which church down again in the drawing room another fire baptist or methodist a name like that fat her place
 burned brightly and lightened up the room replied which was papered in dark brown with dark red curtains it was
 a long room with one side bro table was set with the good dishes white with ken by a bay
 window which was fashionable at gold rim because my mother added to the set the time at each side of
 the fireplace were two when she went down east they were not all prints one of a royal stuart baby
 and the other of limoges china although they all looked alike a madonna as well there was a large copy
 of during the war i used to be afraid that some of the picture dante meeting beatrice and an the
 guests would look on the underside of the other of george v and his family a dozen of the dishes
 and find the ones marked hutschen latter pictures had been sent to father as minister reuther hapsburg austria drawing the
 of education for distribution in the schools of conclusion that we were german spies alberta as even then there were
 several hun after all the guests had arrived my mother dred schools in the province father gave them to would
 let me ring the bell in the living room that cabinet ministers and kept one for himself my registered in
 the kitchen shortly after the cook mother had been brought up in ranching country received the signal the maid arrived
 at the living where everyone had a picture of queen victoria room door to announce that dinner was ready and
 she had this one of george v framed the first course was always cream of tomato in the dining room
 another fire burned but it soup this soup was made from canned tomatoes was a nuisance as the person sitting
 next to it which were one of the bright spots of winter usually got too hot at the time she
 started meals in the early west although we didn t having these dinner parties my mother couldn t know we
 were getting needed vitamin c we buy a tablecloth in edmonton long enough and could taste the fresh tang canned
 tomatoes gave had to have a cousin buy one in england it ca me in the days before refrigerator cars
 brought fresh with huge napkins which the men usually stuck produce from the south making this soup rein their vests
 on the centre of the table there was quired skill tomatoes were added to milk with a a hand embroidered
 doily under the flowers my bit of soda in each but if the order were refather would never have candles
 on the table as versed nothing could be done with the curdled an alderman he had campaigned to get a
 power mess that resulted plant built to generate electricity from coal and after the soup came the moment which my
 he thought it silly to go back to candles the father looked forward to from the beginning of after attending
 private school the author was transferred to mckay avenue school when her father became minister of education the shooting season
 the ducks partridges or when they did my father always told the story of prairie chickens were brought in on
 a large plat bill cust an irishman who settled in st albert ter although he was a crack shot my
 father did late in his life cust had married a frenchnot like stag shooting parties but he kept up canadian
 widow and according to custom her shooting to provide for those winter parties friends and relatives would drop in sunday
 after cleaning the game was always a problem some noon he couldn t understand much of her contimes we would
 have a cook who wouldn t do it versation but when she was showing pictures of and then my mother
 would have to get someone her late husband she would use the phrase from the employment bureau who would every
 comme je le regrette quite often from the once in a while my mother would hear of a new adjoining
 room bill cust would shout old method of doing it but no matter what the women you don t regret
 the passing of that method it was always an unpleasant job frenchman any more than does bill cust during the
 six weeks of the session we some often there was music if my mother knew times kept a second maid
 but if we didn t that some of her guests could play she would ask mother would get a chinese
 boy or mrs them women who hadn had a piano to play gauvrau to help no one could fix celery
 like a during the years they had been on the farm would chinese boy mother always said and it was
 true laughingly apologize for their stiff fingers but that the celery was always crisp and tender we their delight at
 being on a piano stool again were not happy when a chinese came because would more than make up for
 it we were not allowed in the kitchen we didn t after we moved into the new house on sevneed
 these firm instructions because we were enth street in 1912 mother decided we needed a afraid of the chinese we
 thought they would cottage at a lake father didn t believe in sumprobably slit our throats with a carving knife
 mer cottages but when some waterfront on lake because we read the papers about the tong wars wabamun forty miles
 west of edmonton was in chinatown when we did have one of the opened for sale she bought a lot
 and had a chinese in the house father would remark that four room cottage built on it with her own
 monhe had some good chinese clients and that they ey the long weekends of that first summer at the were
 honest and so on our fears were not al lake were father s first holidays since he beca me bayed
 a cabinet minister he loved everything about it we loved when mrs gauvrau came she clearing the bush boating swimming
 long talked as quickly as she worked and was ed walks and sitting with mother in front of the monton
 s chief gossip this was precisely the cottage watching the sunsets the greatest charm reason that my mother seldom had
 her and it of the cottage for father was its location it was was always disappointing when mother would five
 miles from the nearest telephone cut off mrs gauvrau just when she was telling at the end of the summer
 father bought mothsomething interesting about someone we knew er s cottage and extra land at the back so no one
 another reason we liked mrs gauvrau was that could build there the following spring he sometimes she could persuade my
 mother to let brought out a builder and carpenters who raised her make a creamy chrobotte or a shiver y
 the original cottage and built below and around it spanish cream instead of the deep apple pie on three sides
 the result was a split level a which my father thought was the only dessert fit generation before architects planned
 them fathto finish duck dinner er had a few more feet dug out from beneath the conversation at dinner was
 usually about pol verandah in order to park the car there up to that itics after dinner coffee and tea
 were served to time garages were only converted stables located the ladies in the drawing room and the gentlemen behind
 the house strangers would stop and in the den after a while the men returned to the comment imagine a
 garage in a house it was drawing room depending whom the guests were considered somewhat indecent as father the conversation
 would be interrupted by stories finished the inside of the new cottage himself if the guests were old timers the
 stories were with b c lumber i assumed as a child that about the early days the gold rush to
 the yukon ever yone s father could do carpentry like that the formation of the province in 1905 the boom
 at first travel to the lake was by train only on of 1912 and the war of 1914 18 sometimes
 the weekends did a camper s special stop at the guests asked to see my mother s well known railway
 crossings on our side of the lake the collection of photographs of early alberta and transcontinental going through late at
 night summers for the author were spent at lake wabamun seen here about 1914 didn t stop at east waba
 mun but if father came to remember to take a good supply of needles out friday evening he would phone
 ahead to the metal ones for popular records and wooden ones railway office and arrange to have the train let
 sharpened each time for the classical ones him off once he forgot to make these arrange father had some brush
 cleared off and planted ments and he knew he couldn ask the engineer a garden in april as soon as
 the roads wer e to make an unscheduled stop with the help of passable and the ground workable he would
 go the conductor he got the engineer to slow down out and begin the garden by the time we arrived
 the train enough so that he could jump off at on july 1 the salad vegetables were ready this point
 the railway had been built through a although he was always giving away vegetaswamp and father landed on the edge
 of it after bles there were usually some potatoes and root the lights of the train had passed he couldn
 t see vegetables to be brought home for winter it a thing and was afraid to take a step clouds
 bothered father that he couldn t grow corn bemoved overhead and with the help of the moon cause the frost
 came in august he kept trying light he was able to make it to the cottage safely earlier ripening varieties
 one year he thought he mother made him promise never to jump off had been successful but when he went
 out to the again lake to harvest it he found the corn had been in a few years a dirt
 road was built in from the trampled by the neighbour s cow highway and people began driving their cars when
 father was away from home he usually the distance from edmonton was only 45 miles but it took us over
 two hours father said he telegraphed mother one summer he was in ottawa and we were at the lake when
 a telegraph could tell what month it was because the dogs along the way got progressively thinner during arrived i
 was thrilled because it was the first the summer from chasing the cars we were time i had seen my
 name in a telegraph and ask helen to thin out the carrots always crowded in the car on our first
 trip although we had a rack on the running board and we went across the lake a mile and a
 half in a metal trunk at the back of the car we had the motor launchi to the village of
 wabamun to bought the trunk on a trip into the united states get our mail groceries meat and whitefish pike
 and it was quite a curiosity until they became we could catch ny time after we had finished general and
 were eventually built into the back of our shopping father always took us to the ice the car no matter
 how crowded we were we cream parlour in anderson s drug store i chose made room for the gramophone which
 took up a a pineapple soda and loved to watch dr anderwhole seat it was a large oak box which
 rested son the druggist working the spiggots on the on its own cabinet in town and looked like the soda
 fountain dr anderson was not the only console models then popular as we cranked it country doctor who had to
 run a drug store on the and changed the needle for every record we had side to support his family
 the little white church in the village was ang there previously miss gemmill or mme syllican as were most of
 the villagers mrs vestre and other dressmakers had made the anderson was a catholic and her nearest church dresses for
 special occasions such as the openwas the one on the indian reserve close to us ing of the legislature they
 were good at their where father beaudy came to say mass when trade and edmonton women wore their creahe arrived
 mrs anderson came across the lake tions with pride sometimes mother and others by boat and mother walked with her
 to the little sent to england for broadcloth or materials but indian church beside the church was a small they
 had their outfits made by these dressmakers cemetery with wooden crosses although some who could copy any picture you brought
 them so of the graves were covered by tiny houses which well that their customers knew they were just as
 we assumed were part of the indian religion at well dressed as their sisters in the east the other side
 of the reserve there was a method occasionally mother would buy a dress when ist church where a preacher occasionally
 held she was in new york or toronto but somehow services but we could never walk that far we she
 never felt quite as well turned out as when often rode or walked in the reserve itself and miss gemmill
 dressed her it was not yet consometimes went to see the treaty money being sidered good taste to buy a
 ready made dress if given out right after the treaty payment the you didn t have time to have miss
 gemmill indians made a pilgr image to a church at lac ste make something for you and you purchased a
 anne which was a larger catholic centre ready made you didn t talk about it and let the indians often

 furor over conditions of child care in alberta was precipitated through a number of provocative alarming and highly sensationalized exposes
 instigated by canada s leading proponent of child welfare charlotte whitton this woman had enjoyed preeminence for over 20 years
 as spokesperson for the influential canadian welfare council cwc until her retirement from the national organization in 1941 during her
 directorship of the cwc she had conducted surveys of edmonton and calgary social agencies in 1929 and 1931 while between
 1940 and 1941 she and the council had engaged in a lively debate over alberta s reception nd distribution of
 british refugee children during that controversy whitton had charged that alberta s treatment of the r efugees was so cavalier
 and arbitrary that the province ought not to receive any but nominated british children she had kept in close contact
 with alberta child welfare for 20 years and was familiar with any problems that were said to exist in the
 province whitton originally hoped that she could conduct a survey of child welfare conditions in alberta under the auspices of
 the provincial government in order to facilitate the co operation that was requisite to examine government records and to operate
 under the government s imprimateur for the project interviews as early as 1945 with premier ernest manning and the minister
 of welfare dr w w cross had come to nought and neither did they agree to assist her project 2

 autumn 1981 dealt with edward whymper s first visit to the rockies in 1901 whymper obviously planned to return to
 canada in 1902 but in the spring of that year he received a letter from the cpr stating that the
 company did not want him to continue his work that season as a result it was not until july 1903
 that whymper arrived in montreal to begin the second phase of his survey of the rockies a walking tour in
 excess of 500 miles along the right of way from kananaskis falls to yale one of the cpr s officials
 however was of the opinion that the company would derive few benefits from this and suggested instead that whymper tour
 the lake louise region the valley of ten peaks and around field and yoho in addition whymper was to map
 new trails extend existing ones and propose roads over which motor vehicles could travel he was also to explore the
 crowsnest pass and select suitable locations for the construction of a hotel or chalet for his part whymper argued that
 the season was too far advanced to adopt this suggestion and he proposed to complete the original walking tour and
 devote the rest of the season to matters that would take up little time the yoho and crowsnest pass proposals

 on cpr trains and in its hotels was too expensive for him and most tourists he suggested that the railroad

 account of monies advanced many encounters with the forces that were deter to him or completing his duties whymper mined

 then proceeded to blairmore where ing for the pass he informed compa ny officials he was impressed by the view
 of crowsnest that he had covered more than 500 miles between mountain which he described as attractive for kananaskis falls
 and yale and that in good wea an alpinist he also noted that mountains in the ther an average of
 25 miles per day had been region were sepa rate blocks rather than maintained he had crossed the main range

 town since leaving macleod 28 parts of the upper thames yet there was not a by september 29 whymper had
 returned to single settler between banff and laggan dis revelstoke and his preliminary survey of the pass counting places along
 the line that had promi was complete on his last night in revelstoke he nent features or were frequently visited
 whym left instructions to be called at 6 45 am in order per indicated seven areas which were especial to
 have sufficient time to board his train much to ly noticeable among them were albert can his dismay his instructions
 were not carried out yon griffin lake eagle river and little shus and he awakened an hour later as a
 result of the wap lake 23 noise in the hotel he had to board the train on september 23 whymper
 left field on his without breakfast and this did not help his disway to the crowsnest pass he stopped over
 in position 29 calgary and stayed at his usual haunt the alber this incident was but a precursor of more
 omita hotel he observed that the girl waiters nous experiences that plagued his return to monwere as rude and inattentive
 as before the men treal in moose jaw the train departed without however in the hotel were civil a notice
 post him consequently he had the agent wire the ed in whymper s room aroused his curiosity it nigger porter
 on the train to have his effects stated that no one was allowed to have friends of dropped off at
 the next station and returned to the opposite sex in their rooms parlor being moose jaw by the next train
 his belongings provided for that purpose a devious mind however did not arrive on the next train and a could
 not refrain from asking what purpose 24 frustrated whymper went to bed at 8 00 a m the mount stephen
 was examined by whymper during his 1904 trip en route to yoho valley fact that he was charged one dollar
 for a second rate breakfast did not improve matters 3 he described the hotel in the moose jaw station as
 a poor place and dear he complained that there were no candles in his room and furthermore that he had
 been informed that he could not have one he was given only one towel and a very small one at
 that there was a bath room but no water in it bass and dow ales were on the wine list
 but upon ordering he was told that none was available the price of whiskey was so exhorbitant that whymper decided
 to do without his customar y comfort 3 in the midst of these tribulations whymper received a note from the
 porter informing him that his belongings were in winnipeg and that he had left instructions that whymper s ba rometers
 were to be stored in an upright position whymper was so gratified that he left a 2 00 tip for
 the man 32 upon arriving in winnipeg on a train that was three and one half hours late whymper was
 re united with his possessions among the curiosities that he noted on the platform was a corpse placed in an
 ordinary packing case which was not marked keep this side up but was inscribed with the word head 33 in
 montreal whymper contacted the superintendent of sleeping and dining cars seeking a reimbursement for losses suffered in field when a
 suit of clothes had been destroyed by fire a mercurical barometer had been smashed and a personal book had been
 sold in addition whymper also requested the 95 cents owing him from the 22 00 he had left to pay
 he duty on his champagne 34 on october 10 whymper was ready to leave canada for england his passage on
 the montrose had been arranged by the cpr once on board however he discover ed that its cargo consisted of
 hay and cattle he claimed that since the cattle were so noisy and only a thin plank separated him from
 them he thought it best to sacrifice his passage equally frustrating was the fact that the 2 75 paid to
 the cab and porter were completely thrown away whymper finally took the train to new york and booked second class
 passage on the deutschland the following year in 1904 whymper again returned to canada arriving in montreal on june 26
 after a slow passage of 12 days 3 ½ hours he had some difficulty in clearing customs because officers wanted
 to impose a high duty on his ice axes whymper finally contacted the director of customs who cleared his equipment
 on the other hand he exper ienced no problems with his three cases of bouvier champagne 36 in the hotel
 at the windsor station he discovered that one had to eat at specified hours or do without food furthermore whymper
 complained that he had so many meetings with vips that he did not have time to eat and so on
 two successive days i had only two meals a day 37 after securing the necessary passes and orders for himself
 and his party whymper departed for field on july 1 a lesser man than the hero of the matterhorn would
 have been reduced to tears by the unfortunate sequence of events that began shortly after the train left montreal to
 begin with he conductor on the dining car was unable to open the liquor cabinet and the passengers suffered accordingly
 upon arriving in winnipeg a thirsty whymper was informed that no beer could be served because it was after 8
 30 p m in moose jaw he went to the hotel in the station to quench a gargantuan thirst only
 to be told that no beer could be sold because it was sunday 38 in field whymper hired tom wilson
 as his outfitter the high esteem with which he regarded wilson is evidenced by the fact that the manager of
 the hotel in field was instructed not guides christian hasler and friedrich michel to treat wilson like regular members of
 the party arrived and wilson was ready with his outfit 43 on the 1 50 per day basis but on
 the same basis whymper then proceeded to crowsnest lake as whymper that is at 2 50 per diem and he
 became fascinated by the middle la ke and whymper returned to the yoho valley which its island which he visited
 by means of a boat in he had explored in 1901 after examining the his opinion that island offered the
 best site for a mouth of the valley he inspected the tunnel chalet hotel that he had yet seen 44
 from the east under mount stephen and then proceeded to end of the lake whymper looked at crowsnest emerald lake
 and yoho pass where the junction mountain which was still a virgin pea 1 he noted trails were commenced 4
 by july 18 whym that the mountain had a second craggy peak in the per s men had blazed the
 trail from emerald rear and that the col between it and the main sum lake to field leaving a crew
 behind to continue mit appeared to be accessible to the west of the work on the trails whymper prepared to
 crowsnest mountain there was a large unnamed resume his survey of the crowsnest pass as peak with a long summit
 ridge mount tecumseh usual the conduct of some members of the party and whymper suggested that it be named the
 were causing great concern to whymper this longfellow because it reminded him of time it was wilson who became completely
 forest primeval bea rded with moss 45 incapable from drink and shut himself up in his in the meantime wilson
 and the two guides room in field 4 were camped on the west side of crowsnest a few days later
 whymper arrived in the pass mountain according to whymper they were to and inspected the cave near blairmore which was
 cut a trail around the mountain in order to exahe source of the old man river he suggested mine its
 features more closely they were to that a bath house could be built nearby and that it report back to
 whymper and then ascend the would not harm the natural beauty of the cave he peak on july 30 however
 whymper received a also recommended that a few steps should be cut telegram from wilson stating that the ascent had
 in the rock to make it possible for visitors to been made two days previously and that a flag had

 been cutting trails not altogether clear this news greatly disturbed station upon presentation of his pass he was whymper contrary
 to legend it does not appear put up in an inner room where he spent the night that whymper was
 incapacitated as a result of sleeping on the floor immediately under a teleover indulgence nor that he was interested in
 the graph machine which made a horrid noise all honour of making the first ascent in his diary he through
 the night in the dining room he noted noted that wilson s action caused him to revise that the woman
 in charge was as rude as before his schedule as i had no time to lose as could fortunately the
 train left punctually at 7 00 be expected in such circumstances whymper a m 5 between calgary and morley the
 everclaimed that wilson did not understand that he curious whymper counted telegraph poles and had done wrong for their part
 the two guides found that there were 35 in every mile from this wanted to leave and whymper instructed wilson
 he calculated that the train s speed was 27 miles to allow them to do so however hasler and per
 hour 5 michel then asked to remain and whymper whymper arrived in field on august 10 and agreed whymper concluded
 his description of accompanied by wilson and an individual these events with the pregnant phrase this was named robb went
 to the yoho valley to check a very troublesome day on the progress of trail construction whymper the trouble however
 was far from finished did not see any blazes or traces of the trail near when the guides left with
 wilson to cut the trail the junction of the yoho and little yoho rivers around crowsnest mountain they had asked
 for a and this reinforced his conviction that it was bottle of brandy but whymper had refused to pro useless
 to send men out to work without supervivide one on settling his account at the hotel sion he also complained
 that while he photohowever whymper discovered that wilson had graphed the junction wilson and robb began ta ken a bottle
 with him and had charged it to his eating employer whymper attributed their behavior on whymper rectified the problems associated
 that ver y troublesome day to the brandy the with the clearing of the trail and prepared to following day

 eat and drink and did not offer him montreal the agent in field would not give him anything they then
 set up their tent and went to the ticket and said that the agent in banff would sleep leaving the
 others to do the camp chores do so as whymper was boarding the sleeper after the exploration of crowsnest mountain
 in calgary the porter professed to know nothing the services of hasler and michel were no longer about him and
 he was forced to go to the local required and whymper sent them back to field sleeper and later to
 change to the montreal one he instructed the manager of the summit hotel to consequently he had very little sleep

 whymper met with officials of the cpr and gave them what he had written on the alpine club camp an
 account was subsequently published in the montreal gazette this concluded the final visit to canada by the hero of the
 matterhorn on september 16 1910 edward whymper passed away while visiting chamonix it was appropriate that whymper who was referred
 to as the homer of british mountaineering and alpinist of the heroic age was carried to his grave by a
 party of alpine guides in his will whymper remembered the alpine club of canada of which he was an honourary
 member by leaving it a legacy of 50 whymper s death did little to resolve any of the controversies surrounding
 his character and actions insofar as his visits to canada are concerned it is virtually impossible to evaluate the significance
 of his work for the cpr his employment as a consultant and publicist was a component of the company s
 policy of promoting the rockies by building luxury hotels modest chalets employing swiss guides building trails etc unfortunately the reports
 that whymper prepared cannot be found in the cpr s archives nor does this institution possess any documentation concerning his
 employment furthermore of the photographs taken by whymper only two depicting the passage of the royal cortege in field in
 1901 remain in the company s photographic collection elizabeth parker of the alpine club recalled reading a typewritten statistical report
 which whymper prepared for the cpr and was amazed that it lacked the literary style and charm of his other
 books according to parker these statistics lacked vital feeling for the mountain landscape obviously canadian alpinists were not only anticipating
 outstanding first ascents by whymper but also a guide book to the rockies that would rival those he wrote for
 the alps 9 on the other hand the articles which whymper wrote for periodicals such as scribner s and newspapers
 such as the times london were well written accounts of the beauties and features of the rockies while whymper used
 entries from his diary to compile these published accounts it is worthwhile to note that they make no mention of
 the difficulties with guides outfitters letters received from british alpinists talked about the beauties of the rockies and the inspiration
 to be found in mountaineering he concluded his address on a somewhat prophetic note this ladie amid gemitleme is the
 first and it ui i be the last occasion on which shall have the honour to speak to von i
 came out from europe express v for this meeting and tomorrow i start back but if uiiiable to he with
 you in bods i shall so long as i live be you it spirit amid wish so success mid prosperitv
 afterwards wheeler asked him to act as auctioneer for articles which members had no further use whymper consented and included
 articles which he had intended to give away 86 whymper left the club camp on august 8 and his return
 journey was characterized by a confrontation with that ubiquitous character the nigger porter in moose jaw the temperature was 80
 f but the porter kept all the windows closed in the car while the train stopped in moose jaw whymper
 opened the window in the smoking ca r but the nigger porter shut it almost immediately that sa me day

 calgary to edmonton on the morning of the 14 th december three passengers started for edmonton in waggons under the
 guidance of the experienced whip frank boisvat of donald mcleod s stage line we started at ii a m weather
 mild and the cayuses were with difficulty held in we reached scarlett s hotel that evening and although it boasts
 no spring beds we slept comfortably in our blankets on the ground floor early in the morning the sleepless fra
 nk arose and howled nearly three hours before the sun lazily arose we had to drive 60 miles that day
 and one of the horses obtained from the hudson s bay company was useless in vain frank talked to him
 expressively in cree french and english he understood none of these tongues and the whip merely kept him from getting
 cold but frank s skill overcame all difficulties and we arrived at red deer crossing in the evening and found
 mine host collins ready to provide for all our wants here we took to sleighs and fresh horses an ex
 policeman and another man with their own rigs joined us on our journey the next evening we reached battle river
 and pitched our camp frank was sleepless the ex policeman worse for he would let no one else sleep he
 succeeded in waking one of the passengers an oblate father at 11 p m mistaking it for morning frank arose
 and shortly after midnight commenced to prepare breakfast and after threatening and coaxing for the next three hours succeeded in
 getting us on the road the next evening passed without anything worthy of remark except a religious argument between the
 brother and the ex policeman none of us know how long this lasted but from the downcast countenance of the
 ex policeman it was easy to see he had been worsted in the encounter while riding in his sleigh he
 was heard to think aloud what a fool i was to argue with the brother about religion as i forgot
 all about it when i was in the force we arrived at edmonton next day having accomplished the trip of
 200 miles in four days and a half your space forbids me to tell of our return trip suffice to
 say led by the gallant donald mcleod in person enlivened by his scottish love songs and amused by his mild
 conversations with the wayward cayuse we landed in calgar y in four days f rom the time we started making
 the best record of the winter season and ending one of the pleasantest winter trips of the many we have
