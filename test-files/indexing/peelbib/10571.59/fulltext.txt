 2 the patrician 1996 colonel in chief princess patricia s canadian light infantry the countess mountbatten of burma cbe cd 
 jp dl message from the colonel in chief the year 1996 was important regimentally for the celebration of the 45th 
 anniversary of the battle of kapyong during the korean war in which second battalion distinguished itself so heroically and whose 
 members wear the blue ribbon of the citation awarded to them by the u s a for their valour i 
 was very pleased to be able to travel to winnipeg at the end of june especially to take part in 
 the celebrations of a wide and varied nature in which the korean community played an important part the trooping was 
 of the impressive high standard achieved by much hard work in its preparation the presence in the marchpast of 45 
 korean veterans as well as over 100 others gave a very special meaning to the occasion the only sadness was 
 that their highlyregarded 0:highly 0:regarded commanding officer at the time of kapyong colonel jim stone was not well enough to 
 attend it is particularly good to know that second battalion were posted for peacekeeping duties in bosnia at the end 
 of the year in view of their disappointment last year at being stood down for that assignment after much hard 
 training and preparation i shall look forward to visiting them there next year i was not able to visit my 
 first and third battalions this year as their activities at that time did not make it possible but i always 
 hear with great interest what they are doing and know how much hard work is involved in putting into practice 
 plans for new conformations and moves to new headquarters this is always difficult and current changes seem unending but are 
 always faced with the cheerful determination so characteristic of our regiment i am sure the results will be excellent despite 
 the pangs these changes cause 
 the patrician 1996 3 colonel of the regiment princess patricia s canadian light infantry major general c w hewson cmm 
 cd message from the colonel of the regiment in another year of surprise and change all patricias met the challenge 
 marvellously in 1996 third battalion moved from chilliwack to edmonton and reformed as a light infantry battalion first battalion has 
 maintained a heavy training schedule while preparing to close out currie barracks and relocate to edmonton garrison the battle school 
 has maintained all training commitments while preparing for its amalgamation into the western area training centre spared relocation from winnipeg 
 second battalion concentrated on training and also hosted the fine celebration of the 45th anniversary of the battle of kapyong 
 it can be hoped that the budget reductions base closures and unit relocations have now stabilized so that our future 
 can be planned with more confidence the year also held its operational challenge second battalion was tasked to serve in 
 the nato stabilization force and after months of intensive training deployed to bosnia in january 1997 a coy third battalion 
 has also deployed as part of the 2ppcli battle group the first battalion trained for un operations in haiti but 
 did not deploy elements of that battalion deployed to central africa with the disaster assistance response team others stood by 
 in trenton and calgary while the mission was reconsidered and then cancelled the battalion is now training to form the 
 nucleus of the battle group which will deploy to bosnia in july the vast majority of canadians will be relieved 
 when the somalia inquiry finally concludes its hearings and announces its findings two other studies commissioned by the minister of 
 defence into the forces organization and justice system have also been placed on short tracks by mid 1997 we will 
 have a much better idea of how this will all play out but there are already benefits the somalia inquiryhas 
 0:inquiry 0:has demonstrated that we in the forces are measured by a higher standard than most canadians so it should 
 be our awesome responsibility as the final guarantors of the security of this nation demands no less but our higher 
 standard of discipline also requires a more robust and expedient justice system for military personnel in essence we in the 
 military must be prepared to surrender some of our constitutional rights and freedoms to ensure the operational effectiveness of the 
 forces to do this we need to be confident that deeply rooted military ethics will replace the constitutional protection we 
 surrender the reemphasis on military ethics that will result from these inquiries is welcomed and in the judgement of most 
 overdue increasingly there is a realization that the combining of the canadian forces headquarters with the department of national defence 
 bureaucracy in 1972 has done much more to undermine effective leadership than did the unification of the three services some 
 reseparation 0:re 0:separation of military and civilian lines of responsibility seems inevitable and is equally welcomed in the final analysis 
 we must face up to the fact that some ugly incidents did happen in somalia and should not have our 
 own regimental family is not without blame like all good families we will reflect draw our lessons and be better 
 for the experience we will also reflect on the tremendous work done in somalia by the canadian airborne regiment under 
 extremely difficult circumstances and the exemplary service of the vast majority of its members i congratulate all patricias who have 
 finally been awarded the somalia medal and urge them to wear it with justifiable pride

 in exercise patricia storm a company level mechanized offensive exercise those two weeks were brimming with platoon and company attacks 
 conducting offensive operations with tanks the culmi

 the patrician 1996 31 d company delta company was very active this past year with an entire change in command 
 staff of the company time spent in garrison was short as we spent most of our time in the field 
 on various battalion and company exercises the dynamic duo of maj vida and csm hart created varied and challenging training 
 incredibly the company canteen was available throughout all phases of war by day or night regardless of season weather or 
 terrain the success of delta company was due in no small part to the enthusiasm and vigour of 10 11 
 and 12 platoons cfb wainwright was where the majority of the training exercises were held but some training adventures was 
 held at sibbald flats and the crowsnest pass to finish the very successful 1996 training year the company focused primarily 
 on patrolling and live fire defensive operations ranges to most the defence means digging and after patricia badger delta company 
 was very proficient in digging three feet of overhead cover was the company standard and we achieved it within 24

 combat support company the 1996 training year was a fast paced and exciting one for combat support company in fact 
 a number of operations or preparations for operations provided ample opportunity for all members of the company to show off 
 their flexibility and their innate ability to adapt to rapidly changing situations the company busied itself during major exercises by 
 providing the unit with its eyes and ears it supplied the organic indirect fire support it delivered an anti armour 
 punch it fulfilled minor mobility and counter mobility tasks it established comms and it collated intelligence when not participating on 
 major exercises there was also some time to have a little fun at the platoon level as well in august 
 both pioneers and signals platoon conducted adventure training in banff and waterton park respectively anti armour platoon wreaked havoc on 
 the brits as the enemy force for exercise medicine man at the british army training unit suffield recce platoon spent

 has had a hand in putting in gravelled kitchen areas into no less than four separate locations with a fifth 
 already prepared for future operations our most notable accomplishment was a two month deployment to peregrine 7 where we supported 
 exercise patricia badger followed by exercise vigilant palladium where we played host to troops from the 2nd and 3rd battalions 
 as well as reserves from western area and finally the unit pcf cycle life in garrison has consisted mainly of 
 supporting the numerous exercises and operations that have been undertaken by both the battalion and the brigade as the 2nd

 practice the various nations in different aspects of peacekeeping operations these included mine awareness vehicle convoys mass casualty relief civil 
 disturbances humanitarian relief and cordon and search operations the exercise finished with a three day ftx which provided the opportunity 
 for the soldiers to demonstrate what they had learned at the soldier level there was a sense of military comradeship 
 and interest in others techniques and equipment that allowed them to overcome what seemed to be an impenetrable language barrier

 a deployment to bosnia forcing the battalion to work overtime to fit both ibts training and the annual pcf cycles

 was frantically working out a plan for the training required for op palladium the follow on canadian military deployment after 
 the ifor mandate expired with little guidance and no confirmation of the task we set about preparing a plan for 
 the necessary work up training required for wainwright starting with a small group sent to wainwright for the avgp bison 
 turret courses the unit eventually deployed all but a small rear party for exercise prairie thunder 11 which ran from 
 17 october through to 24 november the first phase of the exercise saw the individual companies carry out further ibts 
 training and offensive operations while d company worked diligently in setting up and running the live fire ranges from pairs 
 up to combat team as well as conducting the live fire defensive range it is harrying on the nerves to 
 run a section of engineers through a live fire section range but safety first was strictly adhered to with october 
 coming to a close the weather turned cold and bitter as we moved into phase 2 of the exercise little 
 did we know that we could all write off our winter indoc training as well as conduct operations other than 
 war ootw the battalion ftx had the men chomping at the bit and though the brigade exercise was less intensive

 nothing confirmed would we be left at the altar again not this time the word finally came down that we 
 were indeed going the year ended quietly with the normal block leave and for the majority embarkation leave as well 
 looking back the year 1996 for the second battalion was a very memorable year filled with diversity it was a 
 year where the training was fast paced as a whole bitterly cold during the winter solstice and frustrating during the 
 pre bosnia work ups however it was the comraderie displayed by all patricia veterans and serving patricias during the 45th 
 that kept all focused and rejuvenated towards the unknown mission ahead no one who witnessed the old guards march past

 known as insert dmm roll here 3ppcli forward insert trumpet fanfare here from its meager beginnings as a ten person 
 implementation cell it quickly grew absorbing the ppcli parachute company upon their return from fort polk louisiana later that same

 made in buildings d 2 and d 3 formerly of cabc capt glen cable guy zilkalns deftly grasped the finer 
 points of the ce world and had the buildings innards ripped out and redesigned all this was done under the 
 watchful eye and ruptured stomach of capt chris hernia boy ankersen who much to his chagrin missed his chance to 
 take the basic parachute course with capt shane night jump schreiber eventually and surely with tears in his eyes lcol 
 turner handed over the battalion to lcol moher on 26 june 1996 with a strength of 243 all ranks as 
 the dust settled the smell of burning rubber and the sound of mad laughter filled the air the third battalion 
 had stood up it was getting to look like a contestant in a hokey pokey dance marathon standing up sitting 
 down and shaking all about so many times in the last few years the biggest influx of personnel arrived 12 
 august 1996 as a result of dozens of postings from across canada with even a couple royals seeing the errors 
 of their ways and joining in the fun all this paved the way for the start of the training year 
 in september the battalion is well on its way to full strength at 533 however operation palladium has meant 120 
 personnel of a company have left to serve in bosnia with 2 ppcli the week of 6 9 august saw

 we joined battle on the ice the annual officer ys srnco hockey game was the usual blow out the officers 
 squeaked past the wily if a little old ncos to edge them 6 2 gee that was close it all 
 evened out though the ncos got us banned from the griesbach officers mess after a tame session of piggy back

 the regimental paintings good thing we didn t go with the dco s original suggestion how much is a stuffed 
 coyote anyway a company began deploying for bosnia for operation palladium 2 january 1997 except for those whose passports got 
 lost oh well shortly thereafter we learned that another 120 personnel from b company this time were to prepare to 
 serve with the ldsh rc in july this is of course so tentative that no one believes it not until

 ppcli battle school on the weekend of 23 june lcol austdal will hand over his command to lcol mac lean 
 who as co of camp wainwright will assume command of the newly formed western area training centre watc just the 
 same it has not made preparing this article particularly difficult as i will explain although only called the ppcli battle 
 school since 1 may 1984 the school traces its roots back to the ppcli regimental depot which was raised in 
 calgary on 1 june 1953 from there it went through a series of name changes and locations before landing in 
 wainwright under its present name in 1956 it was moved from calgary to edmonton and was stationed next to the 
 prince of wales armouries in 1957 it moved into its permanent quarters at griesbach in 1968 it was disbanded and 
 in 1974 it was resurrected as the ist canadian mechanized brigade operational training detachment a name it kept until 30 
 april 1984 you ll have to ask the likes of locals captain emery french or majors bob duncan and karl 
 gotthardt how patricia s were trained between 1968 and 1974 change is not something that i believe has ever caught 
 this establishment off guard the introduction of mtsc a few years ago can attest to that as you will see 
 by its distinctly black hatted influence still it will be difficult to see the words ppcli battle school replaced by 
 the more generic western area training centre capt michael blackburn becomes a patricia maj bill pigden and lcol austdal join 
 in the celebration 
 75 the patrician 1996 fust between we patricia s though i think you ll see that subtle efforts have been 
 made to ensure that the centre remains predominately a patricia s domain so next year the patrician can expect to 
 be filled with very similar happenings from the wainwright area what follows then are the not too nostalgic meanderings of 
 the companies past year in retrospect regimentally speaking i would suggest one of the greater events of the year was 
 the rebadging of captain michael blackburn from the vandoos most would agree that he was welcomed with due ceremony sadder 
 events were the untimely passings of mcpl craig cochrane and one of our strathcona s sgt darryl young in memory

 is one soldier s impression of life in recruit company korea platoon recruits proud to become patricia s we came 
 to wainwright as recruits fresh out of basic who thought we knew what it meant to be soldiers but we 
 were in for a big surprise within the first few days we found out that the task set before us 
 would not be easy the first couple of weeks were pure hell and we all thought the world was ending 
 for us our instructors seemed to be inhuman like rabid dogs out to get everything in sight they pushed us 
 to our limits and then beyond sometimes to see whether we would break or not the amazing thing is that 
 no matter how much we marked time or pumped off pushups we never gave up the seemingly torturous punishments read 
 confirmation training only strengthened us as a whole as the weeks progressed we started to understand why our instructors kept 
 saying that you can t get through this course on your own our first field exercise proved this to us 
 it takes a team of three men to pull a toboggan and if you re not all working together all 
 you accomplish is tiring each other out it took us a while to figure this out but once we did 
 it seemed as though we were professionals we learned a lot of lessons on our first exercise and we never 
 forgot them 
 77 the patrician 1996 week five rolled along and we were all a little happier because it was the start 
 of our ranges however our happiness was brief because the weather played against us and it became intensely cold to 
 our instructors surprise we never gave up the will to overcome the cold and accomplish our job i think we 
 surprised the whole camp when our entire course passed the performance objective and topped it off by having everyone qualify 
 as a marksman in the weeks that followed we did a variety of ranges like the c 9 lmg go 
 gpmg 60mm mortar 66mm sraaw l and the 84mm sraaw h i believe that there is no other feeling in 
 the world like that of firing the carl g it s like being hit with a five hundred pound pillow 
 but you don t feel it because your adrenaline is pumping so fast you feel indestructible the c 6 gpmg 
 was another awesome weapon to fire simply because it s an automatic machine gun all in all every weapon system 
 we used was fun it s odd but they seemed to bring out the kid in all of us even 
 our instructors sgt charles ruest ql3 9602 korea supervises 84mm carl g training 
 the patrician 1996 78 c 6 gpmg ready and waiting pies bradley and st germain qlj 9601 kapyong on rappell 
 once all of the ranges were completed we began to prepare ourselves for the next big step the field phase 
 it took a 10l of hard work and concentration on our part but in the end it all paid off 
 our first field training exercise was our patrol exercise long marches combined with long hours of observation was all we 
 seemed to do at first but once all the patrolling was done and the information was gathered the master plan 
 looked obvious the exercise ended with us doing a successful river crossing which was a really high speed and perfectly 
 executed deliberate attack on an enemy position 
 the patrician 1996 79 defensive week came next four days of digging trenches laying mine fields and setting up wire 
 obstacles defensive week taught us a lot about drive and motivation not giving up when you haven t slept for 
 two days and spending ill waking hours digging your trench at times we wanted nothing more than to lay down 
 and sleep but gas grenades and knowing that the job had to be donekept 0:done 0:kept us going some of 
 us experienced exactly what no sleep can do to outminds 0:out 0:minds one soldier who wants to remain anonymous still 
 claims he saw a convoy of eighteen wheelers drive by the exercise ended with a live firedefensive 0:fire 0:defensive battle 
 which we all really enjoyed week fifteen and the final exercise finally arrived all the skills we had learned in 
 the previous weeks now had to be applied in order to survive by this time we had become so proficient 
 at working together that everything our instructors tossed at us was easily matched and overcome the ultimate test of this 
 came when we were taken prisoners of war it came as a total surprise to us because we were not 
 expecting anything of the type at first we were a littledisorganized 0:little 0:disorganized because we didn t know what to 
 expect but after a while pulled back together and overcame the challenge our last test was a live fire platoon 
 attack i am proud to say that it went off without a hitch finally week sixteen arrived and that meant 
 graduation the goal that seemed unreachable was finally in sight we came here as recruits and are now leavine as 
 part of the princess patricia s canadian light infantry we look back after an extended period in holding pi pte 
 les walsh leaves the battle school as the top candidate 
 the patrician 1996 80 at the time spent in wainwright and smile because we overcame it all and never once 
 laid down and died i am confident that we now know what being a soldier is all about working as 
 a team with no one person being better than another cherishing the little things like a hot shower comfortable bed 
 and warm surroundings we are all better people now for what we have accomplished and no one will ever be

 course leadership company 1996 was a year of mixed blessings it was a year of remarkable achievements such as the 
 conduct of an advanced winter warfare course and the organization of a very successful lfwa sniper competition it was also 
 a year of frustration most notably staff shortfalls and the high percentage of attrition on leadership courses throughout the year 
 leadership company staff maintained 0:main 0:tained a professional approach to business and a sense of humour as they confronted numerous

 second in command to captain erik liebert in may leadership company remained dependent on augmentation from units across lfwa to 
 support training all of the regular force ppcli battalions and the loyal edmonton regiment 4ppcli contributed staff 
 the patrician 1996 81 the leadership company training year began with a bang as an losv belonging to the advanced 
 winter warfare course sailed across the battle school transport building and collided with an mlvw while this would not normally 
 be considered as a sign of progress it marked the first advanced winter warfare course to be conducted in the 
 past five years warrant officer paul mansbridge overcame his curse and successfully completed three courses in a row the advanced 
 winter warfare course successfully deployed to taloyoak spence bay nwt with the help of warrant officer dave johnston and sergeants

 the edmonton city police continued their support of the regiment by participating in the final exercise of the basic sniper 
 course their dog teams easily tracked our snipers and quickly earned their respect battle school master snipers had no trouble 
 keeping themselves busy and out of the line of fire a battle school sniper team participated in a competition sponsored 
 by the 10th us special forces group airborne and placed 12th beating two teams from the us navy seals everyone 
 who worked with leadership company will agree that 1996 was an interesting year mtsc question what and where is the 
 only armour squadron permanently under command of a ppcli unit answer the mtsc at the ppcli battle school the militia 
 training support company mtsc of the princess patricia s canadian light infantry battle school is in many respects a unique 
 sub unit firstly and most importantly mtsc retains the distinction of being the only armoured squadron permanently found on the 
 orbat of a ppcli unit secondly mtsc s mix of multi badged training personnel lends the squadron an all arms 
 quality that is normally found only in much larger organizations of a more temporary nature outside of large scale field 
 training exercises or operations it is rare for example that armour infantry engineer and service support personnel work as closely 
 together as is the case at mtsc mtsc is one of the training companies of the ppcli battle school but 
 as the name implies its primary mission is to provide training support for units and personnel of the army reserve 
 within land forces western area as such during the summer months mtsc runs individual armour courses for militia candidates ql 
 2 3 avgp driver recce crewman cougar gunner and basic classification training for officers and oversees collective training for 33 
 militia armour infantry engineer and combat service support units spread across western canada during the summer of 1996 mtsc conducted 
 a total of six national and area armour courses and graduated over 120 successful candidates who eventually returned to their 
 units with the benefit of everything from gunnery to reconnaissance training under their black hats in addition over the september 
 to may period of 1996 mtsc training teams visit and evaluate militia units undergoing training anywhere from thunder bay ontario 
 to victoria british columbia travelling literally tens of thousands of kilometres and observing well over 80 field exercises in the 
 process over the 1997 98 training year with the stand up of the western area training centre at camp wainwright

 was a coy ippcli and they did a great job keeping up the pressure while we hurried to complete our 
 positions when it was all over the eddie platoon had gained some valuable training and had won the praises of 
 both the oc and the co neither of whom were from the loyal eddies in 1993 and 1995 the unit 
 sent a platoon size unit to wainwright to act as enemy force for the 2nd and ist bn the scots

 a few other units played enemy force for the ist bn the welsh guards 1 lorning in on the eddies

 and 29 commando regiment royal dutch marines the welsh guards started on the lefensive as the enemy force patrolled aggressively 
 against them the exercise nded with a bang literally as a large fantasian sty le company attack pushed i he 
 guards back across the battle river forcing them to blow the bridge working with foreign units is always sought after 
 and the loyal edmonton regiment got both excellent training and valuable experience as well as having a lot of fun

 the regular force to take a job with the department of justice in the early 1980s before moving to edmonton 
 a few years ago he also served two terms as the mayor of airdrie though somewhat saddened to see lcol 
 bewick move on we are all looking forward to lcol mclean s tenure the change at the top continued as 
 in september the dco major norm greene retired after more than forty years in the regular and reserve armies coming 
 in to take over as the new dco was major sam moore having just retired from the regular force he

 to regimental issues we gather together once a month and socialize usually we are fortunate to have at least some

 ft of the lz measurements for a team to be awarded maximum points for this event both speed and accuracy 
 were important needless to say in the history of this competition no team has been able to achieve maximum points 
 for accuracy the final event was a cross country run of 6 2 miles 10 km while carrying a 40 
 pound 0:40 0:pound 18 2 kg rucksack preparation of the canadian cct was the responsibility of cabc the cct had

 two members of the singapore team came to assist sgt towell in his gallant effort to help the american across 
 the finish line very quickly it became obvious to sgt towell that this man was not going to finish and 
 required immediate medical attention he proceeded to direct the medical staff and the individual was then put into an ambulance

 improve on some solid soldiering skills and allowed us the opportunity to gain valuable experience from the specific events the 
 competition 0:compe 0:tition provided us with the knowledge of other unit operating procedures and established good international relations which could

 borden one never knows exactly what it s called with the formation of cfrets canadian forces recruiting education training systems 
 it can all get a little confusing especially to an infanteer 1996 has brought about a few changes to borden 
 with the move of the senior leaders course to st jean quebec and now with the exception of the nbc 
 school there is little opportunity for other members of the regiment to come to borden for training so for the 
 vast majority of us patricias we must rely on each other those who arrive here yearly to instruct the various 
 phases of logistic officer courses or the scores of past patricias we see on a normal basis who have changed 
 careers and are now wearing a new hat badge 1996 also saw a senior member of our small community take

 1996 has proved to a frantically busy year we had returned from cyprus with something of a sense of relief 
 and concentrated on moving into our new barracks in bulford the first task on the agenda was to find the 
 vehicles that went with the barracks these had been sent to bosnia more than a year ago and replacing them 
 with other vehicles from around the uk exercised 0:exer 0:cised the quartermaster s department for some time a successful jnco 
 cadre was run in and around salisbury plain and the recce platoon re roled onto tracks the support as platoons 
 trained up a number of riflemen to act as battle casualty replacements and these cadres culminated in some excellent live 
 firing at otterburn the rifle companies were also active and deployed to devon to conduct their own internal training it 
 was at this stage that our manning plot for the operational tour to bosnia became clearer and we learned that 
 a cavalry squadron in the infantry role would be augmenting us with easter over it was the patrician 1996 
 112 the patrician 1996 time to hone our shooting skills whilst c company sponsored the divisional saam b company were 
 dispatched to milton keynes to find us more recruits this they achieved by shanghaiing every youth they found leaving from 
 the local branch of marks and spencers and swelled our number by some 72 without doubt the highlight of the 
 training year was our first meeting with the tactical engagement simulation system the exercise that supports this system known as 
 tesex pits force against force and replicates as far as possible actual battle while the training was invaluable and intense 
 the exercise 0:exer 0:cise did produce its share of lighthearted moments c company captured a tank from the enemy force 
 whilst its commander was enjoying his morning constitutional in the bushes and b company captured imber village in a world 
 record time of one hour and thirty eight minutes the only down side to the whole thing is that any 
 other training will seem tame in comparison in june we held our annual inter platoon competition the bramall trophy 0:tro 
 0:phy won by recce platoon the companies then moved to dartmoor for some much needed field firing and this led 
 us into the run up for our operational training for bosnia we came under the tender hand of the un 
 training and advisory team who led us through a variety of stands that dealt with all of the eventualities that 
 bosnia could throw at us it augured well for what we actually 0:actu 0:ally met in theatre the battalion was 
 deployed in three areas split between the vrbas and lasva valleys battalion hq b squadron cavalry and b company 0:com 
 0:pany were based in gorni vakuf and c company were over the hill in vitez our first major event was 
 the running of the cantonal elections which although 0:al 0:though they were predicted for trouble went off without a hitch 
 due primarily 0:pri 0:marily to a reduction in their scope following the elections the unit reverted to routine patrolling and 
 security duties bosnia is a beautiful country whose individual people are charming unfortunately in groups and under the control 0:con 
 0:trol of their political masters hidden agendas and deviousness are seen as virtues sadly on our early departure no one 
 truly believed that the hostilities are over returning to home the battalion managed to play some of the sport that 
 we had promised ourselves the winter shield sports competition was won by b company and the normal festive round was 
 enjoyed just before christmas time irgj is looking forward to 1997 and its attachment to the joint rapid deployment force

 121 the patrician 1996 victoria branch princess patricia s canadian light infantry association victoria association members have enjoyed a productive 
 year with several 0:sev 0:eral well attended events and the regimental band compact disc project brought to fruition to top 
 off the year we even had a white christmas yes the stuff we all moved here to avoid came down 
 big time the mother of all victoria snowfalls may not have been much by rainbow junction standards but in a 
 town that grinds to a halt with two inches of snow three feet brought chaos among the victims were chic 
 goodman s roof and doug jennings hydro power our 82nd regimental birthday was celebrated march 17 in the bay street 
 armouries where we hold our regular monthly meetings general and mrs hewson were able to attend and dick macintosh proposed

 bell gave a stirring account of the battle from the regimental history summer saw us at the victoria horseshoe club 
 for our annual picnic with the korean veterans association jack deßruijne kindly donated a trophy for what else the horseshoe 
 competition which was won by john crawford and marg macintosh since the italian game of bocce was also available members 
 gave it a try and frank chevrier partnered with morgan desjarlais narrowly beat don worsfold and kathy sevenski 10 to 
 9 we have to thank the entertainment committee headed by olive miller mrs happy harry for all these successful events 
 on september the 26th association and serving members got together at spinnakers pub to mug out len kopan from the 
 work point barber shop len was in residence just a week short of 28 years he has now moved to 
 south surrey in semi retirement but insists on claiming it s white rock although he s two blocks from the 
 white rock border word is that it was not a good career move since surrey has a population of 30 
 thousand sikhs who never get their hair cut business is said to be slow walter is still cutting hair at 
 work point but having worked with len for so long he too has lost the ability to cut hair and 
 talk at the same time john m toiler

 124 the patrician 1996 calgary branch princess patricia s canadian light infantry association 1996 was indeed a year of ups 
 and downs although the calgary branch maintained its strength and purpose the imminent closure of cfb calgary occupied our minds 
 and conversations and what is the impact on the branch we shall lose our meeting place the wo s and 
 sgt mess admittedly the same place kept many junior ranks from joining the branch yet the mess was a good 
 place to meet the rsm and all members of the first battalion wo s and sgt s mess did their 
 best to make us welcome and we are forever thankful for their hospitality the future of the regimental museum occupied 
 our minds as well after all it was the calgary branch that contributed much to the museum and still does 
 many of our members volunteer as docents and thus add to the quality of public programming as well members continue 
 to support the association s 0:associa 0:tion 0:s sponsored casino we accept with satisfaction that the museum will stay in 
 calgary and we shall find a new meeting place before long our social calendar was as exciting as ever the 
 regimental day was enjoyed by all and subsequently we commemorated by installing a stained glass window in the foyer of 
 the museum over one hundred members attended 0:at 0:tended the coverage many members were able to venture to wainwright and 
 take part in the founding of a new branch the accommodations reminded us all of days gone by the occasion 
 however permitted us to renew many friendships and indeed make many new friends certainly the wainwright members proved to be 
 generous hosts in june we held our annual barbecue and dance our entertainment committee under the care of george arthurson 
 did a superb job we expected nothing less the co ippcli and his charming 0:charm 0:ing wife were able to 
 join us over 140 members and guests came out the agm was attended by our president and vice president much 
 to their chagrin council met earlier than expected and both had to leave their steak dinner unfinished while many issues 
 were discussed few were resolved to the satisfaction of the calgary branch it members in general have little to say 
 regarding the business and operation of the corporate affairs of the regiment which is really regrettable surely we need greater 
 involvement and certainly deserve better after a typical calgary summer the branch resumed the monthly meetings 0:meet 0:ings in september 
 in october we held our traditional octoberfest at the kensington 0:ken 0:sington branch of the r c l with over 
 110 members and guests attending it is understood that many lederhosen were worn but some of them fitted leaner 
 the patrician 1996 125 bodies at earlier times remembrance day saw many of our members attend regional activities with our 
 vice president and party joining patricias in strathmore alberta the social year ended with branch members attending first battalion s 
 men s christmas dinner our most venerable member george smith was at his usual best by inspiring the young lads 
 with a poem that touched all the first battalion presented george with a certificate of appreciation 0:appre 0:ciation one can 
 still hear the applause echoing off the wall of af 16 we are indeed proud to have george as a 
 member of our branch a message of cheer and good news have a good 1997 rudy raidt we lost 6

 the patrician 1996 126 wainwright branch princess patricia s canadian light infantry association during lady patricia s visit to wainwright 
 in 1994 she challenged then battle school rsm bert scott to start up a local branch of the ppcli association 
 bert who was about to be retired from regular service for being too old and too grouchy took up the 
 challenge with help from ed bakker and wally komadina he began calling retired patricias in wainwright and area it took 
 a while but we are pleased to announce that the first meeting of the wainwright branch was held in wo 
 sgts mess on 7 nov 95 bert scott was elected president ed bakker vice president and wally komadina secretary treasurer 
 on 29 jan 96 the national president doug bedford informed us that the brmation of the wainwright branch was approved 
 by the ppcli association from the start we received outstanding support from lieutenant colonel austdal commanding officer ppcli battle school 
 and his officers and ncos several of them joined as serving members of the branch members of wainwright branch are 
 included in all social activities of the battle school such as mess dinners men s christmas dinner and graduation parades 
 our branch held several functions throughout the year the highlight was the april visit from members of edmonton and calgary 
 branches they apparently enjoyed the weekend in good old wainwright activities included a tour of the battle school camp area 
 and town of wainwright for some a quick stop in the park hotel was a must to renew old acquaintances 
 for those who ask why would anyone retire in wainwright i will let you know what some of our members 
 are doing ed bakker is the owner president and the only full time employee of bakker s oilfield services bill 
 gray controls all oil company operations in the camp training area bill lemieux still puts on hockey skates and pretends 
 to be bobby orr it s a mystery what don ritheller does and it is best to keep it that 
 way len bogle is protecting camp wainwright when not busy walking his dogs tom boyd manages the junior ranks club 
 and is very involved with the legion roger scully is a gentleman farmer drug and alcohol counsellor range control sgt 
 and part time padre he s got to be the richest man in the area arnie lightbody retired again however

 to know what he wants to do john smith continues to be the only part time soldier doing full time 
 with the battle school bill miller is the recent arrival to

 128 the patrician 1996 manitoba nw ontario branch princess patricia s canadian light infantry association for our branch the 45th 
 kapyong anniversary was the highlight of 1996 over 200 members of the old guard including close to 50 kapyong vets 
 came from as far away as victoria halifax florida and texas to take part for a few this was the 
 first contact with the regiment since the korean war and they were not disappointed the three day event celebrated by 
 the second battalion on the last weekend in june was a terrific success and those who were here will long 
 remember it as the kapyong reunion the weekend began friday afternoon with the association s annual general meeting unfortunately this 
 coincided with the opening of the better ole putting many members in the painful position of having to decide which 
 was the more important many of them were still in the better ole wrestling with this problem when the agm 
 ended the 1996 hyundai accent hatchback donated by sargent hyundai of winnipeg and raffled by the manitoba and north western 
 ontario branch of the association was won by jean swark of winnipeg jean s brother bill who served with ppcli 
 early in world war ii before transferring to the special service force is buried in a cemetery near cassino although 
 our car raffle did not raise as much money as we had hoped we were all pleased the car was 
 won by a member of the patricia family and we did clear 6 787 after expenses we donated 455 of 
 the proceeds to the winnipeg children s hospital research foundation and turned the remaining 6 332 over to second battalion 
 to help offset the costs of the kapyong 45th anniversary much of our time since the kapyong weekend has been 
 taken up with golf with three tournaments hosted by the association the second battalion s junior ranks club and the 
 warrant officers and sergeants mess now we are getting ready for our winter sports shivering shovelling snow and pushing cars 
 we will not be parading with second battalion on november 11th as they will be in wainwright training for their 
 possible deployment in bosnia but we will be having our annual remembrance service at all saints church on november 10th 
 we officially closed the year with our annual meeting in november where we elected jerry franc president for 97 we 
 have recruited 13 new members this year but this increase has been partially offset by the deaths of jimmy tew 
 rick hillyard mary vaughan bob rochon and joe stanley we will miss them all but the loss of mary vaughan 
 was particularly significant in that as the widow of jimmy vaughan our last original she was our only living link 
 with the first world war we also seem to have lost three 1995 members who have not paid their dues 
 this year this leaves us with 112 members in good standing six more than last year always a patricia d
