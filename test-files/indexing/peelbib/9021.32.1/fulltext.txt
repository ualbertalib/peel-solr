 not conclusive or hathawiton the real tête 0:tete jaune was almost case for pierre hatsinaton s being tête 0:tete jaune certainly an
 iroquois named pierre bostonais he however further research indicates that this must have had at least a tinge of blond
 hair to could not have been the case have acquired this sobriquet and undoubtedly with respect to pierre hathawiton whether
 was a mixed blood thus accounting for this this was hatsinaton or not enough informa unusual hair colour for a
 north american indian tion has been discovered to be certain that he there are many scattered references to tête 0:tete jaune
 could not have been tête 0:tete jaune pierre in hudson s bay company records originating hathawiton is almost certainly pierre atawita
 or near the rockies in the upper athabasca peace and fraser river areas pierre thaawita who served with the hudson

 to 1821 and for at least two confirm his identity as pierre bostonais the of those three years was stationed
 at fort st earliest of these is his 1816 account provided in mary 8 though sometimes called atawita a a
 north west company ledger of servants acspelling not too far from robertson s hathawiton counts from 1811 to 1821 12

 1821 10 as will be shown later there is listing is pierre bostonnais dit tête 0:tete jaune evidence of tête 0:tete jaune

 both dated 1816 there is no indication that at therefore not have been tête 0:tete jaune the time he was employed
 by the north west whether hatsinaton is hathawiton or company bostonais name next appears in a thaawitha is unclear in
 the hudson s bay com hudson s bay company fort chipewyan account pany records of the time apart from robertson
 s book of 1821 22 specifically a book of iroquois letter there is not a single mention of anyone and
 freemen accounts 3 in the index the entry with the surname of hatsinaton if it is a variant reads bostainais
 pierre dit tetejaune and the spelling of hathawiton the name pierre hat heading of his actual account is pierre bostonais
 sinaton may have come to replace the name tête 0:tete dit tete jaune his account indicates a debit jaune not by
 intent but by error in the later for sundries purchased in 1821 at fort st copy of robertson s letter

 out west by the north west correspondence at fort st mary in l 8 l 9 20 ui company and
 to a lesser extent the hudson s likely made two copies of this letter one for bay company in the

 williams with st regis reserve near present day cornwall the pierre hatsinaton replacing the tete jaune north west company hired
 iroquois to act as reference is in the governor s records in the voyageurs and as hunter s and tr
 apper s in the hudson s bay company archives since no newly opened up areas of the west the first
 other record of any hatsinaton exists and since recorded date of an iroquois in the west is 1794 pierre hathawiton
 did accompany the giasson with the period of greatest influx being 1800 04 expedition it is likely that with all
 the copying as many as 300 iroquois may have been brought of robertson s original draft by others that hat

 giasson 30 giasson also informed robertson that pierre to return to canada and by the failure of duncan the guide

 return via the peace river engaged without delay i shall not limit you to and rocky mountain portage for robertson
 terms we absolutely need their services and you recorded in his journal that giasson would wait will therefore make the
 best bargain you can at the rocky mountain portage even though he also stated that william brown would lead giasson

 the largest crude producing field in the method for oil and gas at its battery 34 located british empire in
 the centre of the oilfield since previous largescale depletion of gas caps had decr eased the from 1936 to 1941
 nearly 200 wells were pressure within the reservoir to such a degree that drilled in the turner valley field only
 six of it was impossible to recover oil and gas water which turned out to be dry holes turner valley
 injection was tried as a method of maintaining eventually had over 300 oil and gas wells all in pressure being
 quite successful the secondary production and in 1942 it hit a milestone with recover y method is now used extensively
 oil production exceeding the 10 million barrel throughout oil fields today mark production remained at a high level during the
 war averaging 24 thousand barrels daily perhaps the most remarkable fact in the history significantly aiding the war effort of
 the turner valley oilfield is that it was local oilmen who were responsible for initiating the the turner valley plant
