 5 editor s page the annual journal is a chronicle of the ever advancing history of the regiment on the 
 following pages you will read of the exploits of it s various elements their achievements set backs hilarious moments and 
 some not so humorous events during 1972 ft is in this latter vein that we reflect on the passing of 
 mrs a hamilton gault the widow of our founder reflect we must for she left her impression on the regiment 
 and on those thousands of us who had the privuege of coming in personal contact with her her death on 
 the 29th of september 1972 wrote 30 to a page of the regiment s history sir edwin leather addressing a 
 filled to capacity st mary magdeline church taunton somerset on the occasion of a memorial service for mrs gault said 
 in a life and character so incredibly diverse as dorothy s the ripples of our memories must run in a 
 thousand different directions and so they do my personal memories encompass the privilege of tasting her boundless hospitality prior to 
 escorting her to canada in november 1971 her questions and her delving into the detaus of our trip would make 
 one believe she was travelling to canada for the first time rather than just once more among the great many 
 times that she had crossed the atlantic in referring to the memories of mrs gault sir edwin leather said everyone 
 of us would teu a different story and we would all be right we should all be bursting with sentences 
 beginning yes of course but do you remember how she said this or how she did that it is impossible 
 is it not to think of dorothy or of hammi e separately he asked and later in the regiment as 
 in our hearts they shall assuredly know eternal life those of us who knew her intimately will mourn her briefly 
 each in his own way and each in turn will then keep her memory alive forever our thoughts are also 
 with our colonel in chlef in her hour of breavement at the passing of her husband admiral the honourable sir 
 alexander ramsay gcvo kcb dso his death on the bth of october 1972 brought to an end a marriage of 
 historical signiflgance which spanned 53 years princess patricia married the admiral in 1919 and in so doing and at her 
 own request relinquished all royal titles to become lady patricia ramsay funeral services were held in st george s chapel 
 windsor castle with burial taking place in the royal burial grounds at frogmore in a year that had its moments 
 of sadness for the regiment the battalions continued to perform in a most excellent manner and have again proven that 
 they are second to none stories of their exploits are scattered throughout the pages of this journal as far as 
 regimental headquarters is concerned it has been an excellent year the patrician 1971 was accepted with its normal amount of 
 enthusiasm even though the costs had soared and necessitated a rise in the selling price the regimental newsletter has continued 
 to flourish beyond our wildest hopes this ed tor continues to find it a source of enjoyment and satisfaction the 
 periodic requests for assistance with the postage fund have been satisfactory 0:satis 0:factory and the fund has frequently fluctuated on 
 the credit and on the debit side but over the year has always met our needs lieutenant colonel retired ej 
 williams has written a book princess patricia s canadian light infantry one of the famous regiments series it covers the 
 history of the regiment from it s formation in 1914 up to and including first battalion s tour of duty 
 in 1971 in cyprus as a history it is written so that it can be easily read and understood by 
 the newly joined officer or recruit and thoroughly enjoyed by the older patricia copies are available from regimental headquarters

 it will be gratifying to the many ladles of the ppcli jubilee wives club to be aware that their stirling 
 efforts of 1963 and 64 are still embodied in the gate the regiment is indebted to the canadian airborne regiment 
 for the return of the gate to it s rightful place

 are reminded that the focal point for a nationwide reunion will be calgary and it is hoped that all patricias

 11 management leadership morale by lieutenant colonel r f bruce mbe cd it will come as no surprise to readers 
 of the patrician that coincident with unification and the federal government s emphasis on modern business management 0:manage 0:ment processes 
 that management techniques are highly emphasized in today s canadian armed forces the aim of this paper is to suggest 
 how we of the infantry 0:in 0:fantry can and must adapt ourselves to the resulting changing environment don t be 
 misled we of the infantry pioneered the systems now widely appropriated 0:ap 0:propriated by industry by good staff work as 
 we called it once we recognized the need for unit and headquarters standard operating procedures for battle procedure and a 
 temporary 1943 44 overenthuslasm for battle drill but having been exposed to a fair degree of management and the joys 
 and frustrations of commanding and leading troops i believe that we of the infantry must carefully review where we are 
 and where we must adapt both ourselves and the variety of management techniques to find the right answer that must 
 be to maintain our professionalism and resulting unit morale at a high level service unification has compounded our dilemma in 
 brief and with some oversimplification it can be said that naval and air forces man equipment land forces equip men 
 a fighting ship is literally a weapons system firm discipline 0:dis 0:cipline and effective training are essential but in action 
 the captain fights the ship and everyone else aboard goes with him the fighting aircraft is flown by the captain 
 shepherded by ground control again a weapons system the exacting demands of maintenance pre planning etc are all done at 
 a base where good management discipline and effectiveness are required but rarely in proximity to the enemy individual men properly 
 organized and led are the basic fundamental of the combat arms and particularly the infantry in battle the physical distance 
 between groups or individual pride group loyalty esprit de corps and confidence in his leaders if he is to perform 
 the assigned mission many theoretical experts and some very experienced naval and air generals fail to grasp this fundamental difference 
 the danger to combat arms lies in the inability of management experts to comprehend that while leadership is part of 
 management both are only part of military command in the land element professional experienced infantrymen can assess infantry units for 
 training and administrative proficiency but lt the acid test of the so called threshold of danger of combat where our 
 predetermined management objectives are proven by the performance of individuals in platoons 0:pla 0:toons companies and battalions because this is 
 our whole ralson d etre no management expert or system can rationally ignore our fundamental requirements 0:re 0:quirements to maintain 
 dedication individual and group motivation under proper leadership to meet the requirements of combat apart from the royal canadian mounted 
 police agent who has infiltrated murder incoporated no other civilian counterpart even generally equates to the competent professional infantryman in 
 the june 1963 military review 1 a team of behavioural scientists outlined military leadership as a function of the relationship 
 of two dimensions one is people the other is misstonjthe military leader s job is to accomplish missions through the 
 effects of people fl outlined at figure 1 is a graphic portrayal scaling the two dimensions thgp five examples shown 
 indicate how the underlying assumptions a leader m kek about people and missions affect this handling of specific situations ccaa

 12 ikb military leadership grid figure 1 9 1 leadership lower right corner of grid characterizes strong tough leadership 0:leader 
 0:ship with the leader convinced that people s wants and desires must be subordinated 0:sub 0:ordinated to organization goals this 
 leader uses the reward and punishment system to motivate his people this style is effective in combat situations or short 
 range goals conversely its closed authoritarian concept results in individ 0:indi 0:vid aals using their creativity for the good of 
 the individual and often against the organization goal the attitude of dedication is lacking it induces little cooperation 0:co 0:operation 
 or mutually productive effort 1 9 leadership epitomizes concern with people morale and esprit de corps the concept is one 
 of giving warmth acceptance and loyalty expecting devoted loyalty in return weak soft leadership distinguishes the 1 9 leader the 
 assumption that well cared for subordinates will perform has never been proved in practice and little committment or dedication to 
 the true organizational goals will result without the leader s example the result is often a fat happy easy going 
 organization which cannot meet any real test of operational efficiency 
 13 the 1 1 leader has minimal concern for people or for the mission this is obviously not leadership yet 
 the military like other large bureaucratic organizations 0:or 0:ganizations has many people with 1 1 orientations this man appears most 
 commonly as a result of promotion passover or other personal defeat rather than starting this way he is adept at 
 buck passing following regulations slavishly and marking time his command becomes defeatist and eventually it takes a 9 1 to 
 wield the hatchet to induce change 5 5 leadership is middle of the road the approach is not to command 
 or direct but to motivate and communicate to get the mission accomplished it involves persuasion requesting selling and because he 
 is pulled in two directions he becomes involved in balancing compromising and manipulation it has been estimated that over 70 
 of us army leaders are in this category and predictably such leadership produces an average unit such a leader demands 
 and gets not excellence but a steady pace not dedication but reasonable progress the 9 9 leader views his responsibility 
 as that of achieving organizational performance through participation and involvement of people and their ideas this leader thinks of teams 
 and team unity recognizing that personal gratification 0:grati 0:fication and sense of contribution result from success in accomplishing the organizational 
 0:or 0:ganizational mission 9 9 leaders encourage new ideas and alternative solutions where conflicting views exist they are brought into 
 the open and weighed up against the mission requirement and human concerns simultaneously not only in combat but in garrison 
 the leader builds his team on interdependence the foundation with his subordinates are mutual respect common goals trust and understanding 
 0:under 0:standing in 1957 field marshall whliam slim wrote an article leadership in management 0:manage 0:ment in the australian army 
 journal 2 in 1966 he gave a lecture at the staff college camberley on leadership which i was privileged to 
 attend field marshall slim commanded every echelon from infantry section to an army group in burma and was later chief 
 of the imperial general staff he gained a place in history as an outstanding soldier and his views warrant some 
 consideration to extrapolate from slim s 1957 article he comments that the problems of any great organization are the same 
 organization transportation equipment resources and above all and through all human relations there is a difference between leadership and management 
 just as there is a difference between general motors and an army the leader and the men who follow him 
 represent one of the oldest and most effective of human relationships the manager and those he manages are a later 
 product with neither so romantic nor inspiring a history leadership is of the spirit compounded of personality and vision its 
 practice is an art management is of the mind more a matter of accurate calculation statistics methods and routine its 
 practice is a science managers are necessary leaders are essential the personality of a successful leader is a blend of 
 courage will power knowledge judgement flexibility of mind with integrity the infantry leader must recognize the management environment of today 
 and the benefits of modern techalqies while realizing that none are an end in themselves 0:them 0:selves in so doing 
 he should use the good proven management techniques but clearly understand that our profession demands more than any existing management 
 0:manage 0:ment system can currently achieve leadership must not only continue to be practiced but be improved and follow through 
 into the unique infantry world melding the proven principles and practices of great military leaders with the higher level management 
 policies of the forces we should study to improve our individual techniques rem mbering that it is our man to 
 man relationship and group unity that produces the esprit de corps upon which our proud traditions were built and must 
 continue to be maintained besides being prepared to fight to retain our badges and the regimental system we must ensure 
 that our vital ingredient the individual soldier is led not merely managed unchangingly and truly he s holding up the 
 whole damn line

 15 first battalion the year 1972 could probably best be described as a year of change and reorganization 0:re 0:organization 
 for the first battalion prior to christmas 71 all had returned from their post cyprus leave and the cyprus main 
 body and the rear party began to get re acquainted the newly formed d coy under major w h minnis 
 was welcomed into the battalion operationally 1972 began with a battalion exercise in the rugged ghost river area north west 
 of cochrane it was a valuable shakedown exercise and provided all with a good assessment of their organization and an 
 excellent basis for the remainder of the year s work in february c coy was off to chilcotln for an 
 introduction to military skiing and a crack at the 3rd battalion lt colonel hewson chief umpire for ex rapier thurst 
 11 and a number of other umpire staff personnel from the battalion joined c coy there just before the major 
 exercise it has been noted that charles coy attained a high degree of expertise in fantasian winter sports they will 
 impart their secrets to the restof the battalion during the second annual f n o g fantasian national olympic games 
 some time in the new year february and march were mainly devoted to unit courses b coy were off to 
 coral harbour and a good introduction to the canadian arctic the battalion s members were all together on the 17th 
 of march for an excellent birthday celebration 0:cele 0:bration highlighted by the mud bowl as the snow melted away preparations 
 began for the trooping held in the 26th of may the patricia family was well represented with members from across 
 the nation responding in good numbers as all will testify it was an excellent trooping the companies had a short 
 breathing space before going to school battle school a coy were the first victims followed by c b and d 
 coys many valuable lessons were learned at all levels and the team spirit was very evident the summer fled by 
 with most people getting some leave and at least one major task be it assisting during the militia concentration or 
 instructing on the varied student summer employment programmes administered by cfb calgary this year s summer concentration in wainwright took 
 place in rather adverse weather conditions of snow and heavy winds the hardy troops of a coy fresh from the 
 wars in fort asslniboine joined the battalion in mid september and all suffered through the unseasonable conditions after waincon another 
 round of unit courses was organized to ensure a pay level 4 speciality for all who required one the battalion 
 was also tasked with training the base defence force the various base support staff personnel appeared to enjoy the break 
 offered by some operational training as this article is being written most of the battalion is on leave enjoying the 
 holiday season with their families before the rigers of ex queen s ransom begin in late january 1973 promises to 
 be another eventful and interesting year preparations are now being made for the canadian forces ski championships to be held

 16 hq company patrician report as the first quarter of 1972 slipped quickly past members of hq company had barely 
 enough time to turn in their trooping whites when the advance party of the ppcli battle school roared off to 
 that part of the province where almost everyone agrees the proverbial stake is driven in the ground wainwright on arrival 
 the company took up new formations becoming range construction sections enemy force groups umpire groups and self supporting administrative groups 
 all this plus a headquarters group assembled at a grid reference along circle route probably better known as hunts holiday 
 haven after three weeks of sweat and toil the last of the rifle companies disappeared into the fog and we 
 began the retreat to calgary some of us still wondering if the cqm3 did in fact go to the barn 
 dance at buckhorn ranch committements for instructors for various jobs and locations all across canada were high on the priority 
 list throughout the summer months just in case one of us may have missed out on visiting wainwright during june 
 the battalion returned 0:re 0:turned in force for the annual militia concentration in july where we supervised a few beweudered 
 militiamen while this was going on mwo white la was ably urging the rifle team onto higher and more proficient 
 goals a new definitely more attractive recruit began to appear on the scene during the summer referring of course to 
 the female students who signed on for the student summer program suddenly young corporals in this company began arriving early 
 for work and they say some even tried to buy their positions as instructors just in case walncon 72 proved 
 to be different and no doubt will be a source of conversation for years to come old man winter arrived 
 shortly after our bivouac was established 0:es 0:tablished and arrived is definitely an understatement during the two day storm that 
 just wouldn t let up the observer couldn t help but notice the endurance and good humour of the canadian 
 soldier young and old just when all concerned were really getting used to the cool conditions word was received that 
 wainwright camp had several vacant buhdlngs that definitely needed scrubbing out so we reluctantly moved into the hot stuffy confines 
 of an h hut and commuted to the training areas from there no doubt volumes could be written about incidents 
 that occur during a concentration 0:con 0:centration of this size some to be rememberedand talked about for years others are 
 best forgotten mortar platoon probably gained a first by providing overhead illumination during an officers mess dinner this turned out 
 to be a practical demonstration of why emergency shell scrapes are always handy to have close by the company transport 
 sergeant continued throughout the concentration to give driving demonstrations that are not normally found in the book and climaxed the 
 whole show by doing a fantastic link up with holdfast this in the dark and without lights that portion of 
 the night move was slightly delayed whue the csm and the cqms were extracted from the glove compartment the sea 
 element s loss was our gain or so it seemed at walncon 72 as all ranks smacked their lips over 
 not one but two rum issues let s hope that this habit forming practice stays around for a long long 
 time on return to calgary the weapons platoons immediately set about passing on their knowledge to a new group of 
 patricias whom we are sure will take their turn at riding into battle for a change headquarters has always had 
 some beautiful people if we may use a term bantered around quite a bit these days and just to confirm 
 that statement beautiful 0:beau 0:tiful miss headquarters company who answers to the name of sergeant remin sergeant that s his 
 nickname went on to win the miss french grey cup award no statistics were disclosed at the time of judging 
 and we found later that this was not because the data was restricted but was because the tape measure wasn 
 t long enough at the time of this writing the christmas season is upon us and all ranks in this 
 company are being granted some well deserved leave congratulations on a job well done during the past year and good 
 luck to all in the future 
 17 a company 1 ppcli 72 seemed to be an extremely busy year we were either going on exercise or 
 just arriving home from one starting in january with alo day exercise in the ghost river area and terminating with 
 a fall concentration in good old wainwright most of us agree that walncon 72 was another winter exercise what a 
 way to start and finish a training year our most enjoyable period although not a soul wanted to admit it 
 at the time was when we were tasked as enemy against the killers from the sky canadian airborne regiment on 
 ex ready now ii in the fort assinibolne area we acted as a guerilla force commanded by col kompf of 
 the athabasca brigade and gave col pitts and his boys a real run around every officer and man in the 
 company at one time or another managed to get captured excluding those from 1 platoon with our exalted leader being 
 the only one to escape in his bare feet yet many names crossed the company roll during the year 58

 us from deutschland lts dobson and kreuger arrived in time to accompany us on ex ready now il the big 
 red machine had a successful year in sports with the most noteworthy being the decisive victory in broom i loo 
 on the 17th of march we suffered an unpopular defeat at the hands of b coy bombers in the french 
 grey cup final when a last second touchdown snatched victory from us promotions weren t too plentiful at all if

 british exchange officer captain peter chamberlin we borrowed a company 21c and 30 soldiers from the remaining 0:re 0:maining companies 
 within the battalion packed our rucksacks and headed north our first week involved basic winter indoctrination at churchiu a tour 
 of that thriving metropolis the eskimo museum and the hudson bay company then on to coral harbour and a gruelling 
 but interesting trek through the arctic wasteland 0:waste 0:land all in all it was a long but enjoyable two weeks 
 with a few laughs and much knowledge gained about survival in the north next on the list was a month 
 s drlu and with the trooping behind us we headed for wainwright and battle school this period proved to be 
 both enjoyable and very beneficial to the junior ncos who were tasked with leading patrols through obstacle courses at night 
 and giving fire control orders on live firing exercises on our return to calgary we were given the job of 
 setting up and running ssep from 10 jul 05 aug although this was a new experience to most our administration 
 0:admini 0:stration was very capably handled by capt harry elliott and sgt bud hubert capt don hill and wo john 
 vallance handled the training thus leaving the oc major lew mackenzle and the csm mwo jack murray free to play 
 soccer against the students once ssep was over the company got off on a well earned three weeks leave and 
 most returned a little heavier and itching to get into waincon 72 waincon 72 from 10 sep 06 oct 72 
 was really quite unique we remember that one dark cold night everyone had to be aroused to remove the snow 
 from the tents so they wouldn t collapse on the combat group company test exercise appropriately named panther claw our 
 company although slightly damp after assisting the umpires through the swamp completed the final assault on badger hill and were 
 highly praised for their efforts on the final exercise the coy felt a little forgotten due to the minimum contact 
 with the enemy but when last seen the csm was running from trench to trench with the rum issue under 
 his arm next it was back to calgary to the running of unit courses and of course and underdog team 
 from b coy won the french grey cup beating a coy 17 12 on the final play of the game

 battalion winter exercise rotating river in the ghost river area and one in february for the combat group exercise rapier 
 thurst ii at chllcoltln much was learned of the devious methods adopted by fantasia and gritlnks are still exchanged between 
 loyal comrades and veterans of these campaigns the most important results were that we adopted the name of c or 
 ski company and have also established the annual fnog fantasian national olympic games a mixture of likely and unlikely winter 
 sports events imbued and imbibed with our traditional national sense of fantasian humour we then reverted to friendly forces and 
 took part in all battalion activities through the spring and summer including unit courses trooping battle school and mllcon in 
 between we managed to win the inter company athletics run the combat group combat leaders course and also a field 
 operations training course for all ranks of all arms and services after a welcome block leave break in july we 
 set up the battalion adventure training programme in the kananaskls lakes area and put most of the company plus some 
 a and h 3 company personnel through a tough but enjoyable two week course it was the first opportunity for 
 many to get to know some of canadi s most beautiful and remote areas at walncon 72 we had to 
 brush up on our footborne operations as well as fulfilling our mechanized role quite apart from carrying out both in 
 snow conditions 0:con 0:ditions without winter gear however the challenge and activity helped pass the time even faster than usual 
 on return to calgary sgt trapper couronne set up yet another of his apc driver courses and we are even

 33 support company notes support company in our battalion handles the administrative support of all that the battalion does in 
 the field and in garrison we work while others play was our motto for this year one we tried out 
 early in the new year on the unit organized winter exercise at ghost river in february it was a good 
 shake out for a new team supplying as we were both first and second line support in our lighter moments 
 some of us had fun on csm johnson s snowmobile until it broke down padre ron sutton said one day 
 i wish i had a vehicle to go forward with with a smile the csm replied i d lend you 
 my skldoo but it s kaput an hour later we got a message from bhq requesting a drive belt for 
 an n s cruiser outside their area ten miles away strange the cfr number was exactly the same as the 
 csm s vehicle then there was the on loan doc who wouldn t leave the uas tent that s the 
 trouble with herman nelson heaters and winter exercises comparatively milcon was easier and a warm up for the fall the 
 company was temporaruy commanded by a muitla armoured corps lieutenant colonel and that was the trip we finally got our 
 own doc capt bui myers now if we can only squeeze a little work time in among all those courses 
 basketball football games and skiing during the summer cpl demkiw of the maintenance platoon and mcpl basse of the mp 
 section found themselves out instructing students along with their infantry fellows and did very well at it as did all 
 members who participated in the various ssep programmes for this year s waincon the team was a bit disrupted as 
 capt chris smith went to ottawa and capt bob burns came in to replace him as 21c qm went on 
 course to get converted we got a new rq mwo reinholdt and a new etqms mwo steele the csm became 
 the rsm and cq udell took over that job wo wuson came into maintenance pi etc etc the oc was 
 almost the only old boy there and he is now also dco he never learned how the cp operated anyway 
 but generally we muddled through and even had some minor excitements like the shipping in of 2400 lbs of explosives 
 ordered by someone forward who didn t expect it to arrive and suddenly there it was or the 3 ppcli 
 by pass operation that landed on our door step unbeknownst to 3 ppcli thankfully there we were a3o vehicle snake 
 trying to sneak out the back door surreptitiously cq audie murphy da vies stul maintains we should have stood and 
 fought during this exercise the corps of drums was there in part guarding a echelon and in part guarding the 
 bhq complex with its special palace guard contingent looking very much like the rat patrol the year finished up with 
 a round of unit individual courses several infantry 0:in 0:fantry corporals in the company took the pay level 6a course 
 and to a man did well which is difficult when one remembers itis based on infantry section leading and they 
 have little opportunity to practise this the commanders inspection was the occasion for a real dusting down of c 4 
 the commander could hardly see for the glare he also found nothing worthy of note in the change lockers this 
 period also saw the marriage of albert our civuian maintenance friend who showed he had not forgotten his former service 
 when he went on orders parade to receive a small gift frcjn the company and who in return presented the 
 company with a new mascot a beautiful grey huskie puppy that we have named princess princess was taken to be 
 introduced to the co and showed the proper support company resoect by dampening his carpet just a little w y 
 as our year end s we are standing our annual technical inspection and preparing for yet another winter exercise with 
 gladness in our hearts

 41 second battalion granting of the freedom of the city of winnipeg and trooping the colour the major event of 
 the year for 2 ppcli was the battalion s tour of duty with the un forces in cyprus however the 
 chronicle would not be complete without a few words relating the important events which took place prior to the battalion 
 s departure for cyprus in october during the first few months of 1972 the battalion remained in winnipeg it s 
 first uninterrupted period in winnipeg since it s arrival in 1970 the period was used to catch up on long 
 delayed administrative problems and unit specialist courses this relatively quiet period culminated in one week of festive activities in mid 
 june immediately prior to the battalion s departure for the 1 combat group and militia region concentration in walnwright alberta 
 on june 15th the return of the princess patricia s canadian light infantry to winnipeg after an absence of 26 
 years was celebrated by a parade at assinibolne park and the granting of the freedom of the city of winnipeg 
 to the regiment councillor william norrie representing mayor stephen juba inspected the battalion and took the salute he presented the 
 co lcol a j g d de chastelain with a scroll formally permitting formed bodies of the regiment to march 
 through the city with bayonets fixed drums beating and colours flying after the presentation the troops returned to selkirk lines 
 where a better ole was laid on for all ranks at the junior ranks club everyone attended and the party 
 can best be described as an ehtusiastic one and excellent start for the week s festivities that night the officers 
 mess and sr ncos mess both had mess dinners after the afternoon s celebrations these functions presented no problems and 
 developed into roaring successes fortunately there was a day s reprieve before the next major function trooping the colour the 
 trooping also took place at asslniboine park the large grassy fields surrounded by trees served as an excellent background for 
 the six well disciplined guards the atmosphere was further enhanced by the massed band consisting of both 1 ppcli and 
 2 ppcli corps of drams and the training command band several thousand citizens of winnipeg watched the parade from grandstands 
 erected for the occasion by the battalion pioneers his honour the lieutenant governor of manitoba wuliam john mckeag took the 
 salute on the marchpast the only problem of the day was the strong manitoba wind which blew the headdress of 
 soldiers and spectators alike helter skelter after the parade the troops returned to selkirk lines where all three messes were 
 busy with dress balls at 8 pm just prior to the opening of the mess functions the battalion corps of 
 drums and the 2701 winnipeg ppcli cadet corps drum beat retreat the weather was perfect for this event and the 
 music and precision of the marching was excellent salon hours kay s beauty salon currie plaza 9 am to 6

 know one another much better than we would have been able to at home we have gained some idea of

 0:cor 0:porals beat the privates at hockey by a good margin and the sergeants just squeezed by the officers 5 
 to 4 in the dying moments of a deadly close gam that nearly ended in a tie the day of 
 the anniversary held many promises for a great many events were scheduled chariots were built by all companies and the 
 president of the victoria branch of the ppcli association colonelo r brown was on hand to judge these the the 
 chariots were raced the pushballs pushed the 3 4 ton trucks jammed and the bicycle race run the prizes were

 79 operation slick licker by lt v w kennedy at 1500 hours on 9 march 1972 capt a s johnston 
 oc a company was tasked to provide 60 men to assist hmcs gatineau in the clean up of approximately 0:approxi 
 0:mately three miles of shoreline in nanoose harbour just north of nanalmo on vancouver island the shoreline had been contaminated 
 by an accidental spill of approximately 1 000 gallons of light fuel oil from hmcs gatineau a company deployed the 
 following day with the company r group departing work point barracks at 0515 hours followed 15 minutes later by the 
 main body instead of taking only 60 personnel equipped with coveralls rubber boots and shovels as requested captain johnston decided 
 to take the company complete 73 personnel available and additional vehicles and stores which were found to be badly needed 
 to complete our task a company was completely on the ground at ranch point on nanoose harbour s north shore 
 at 0745 hours and had deployed to its assigned beaches by 0900 hours the contamination was confined to the west 
 end of the harbour which contained commercial oyster beds and herring spawning grounds commander t s murphy captain of hmcs 
 gatineau who was in charge of the clean up had divided the contaminated area into four beaches oyster beach penny 
 beach river beach and goal post beach a company occupied river and goal post beaches with one and two platoons 
 on the latter and three platoon on river beach these two areas consisted primarily of tidal flats and sandy beaches 
 the oil slick was attacked by distributing peat moss on the slick at high tide and then recovering the oil 
 soaked moss as the tide receded this meant that some of the company spent upwards of eight hours up to 
 their knees and sometimes up to their waists in water even though we were in the herring spawning grounds there 
 were plenty of oysters available and quite a few indulged themselves either by eating them raw which did not appeal 
 to pte rowe who developed a queasy stomach from watching mcpl cornfield or heating them beside one of the beach 
 fires the normal meals though were better cooked and were brought from the gatineau in hay boxes the first meal 
 brought ashore was a bit skimpy on the meat side of things which prompted the wo moose macdonald to go 
 aboard the ship and have a little chat with the cooks he returned three hours later with a small snack 
 consisting of pork chops mashed potatoes and corn the company never wanted for food again the generosity of the gatineau 
 did not stop at the excellent food but included the issue rum tot at the noon meal and beer at 
 the evening meal a company stopped working at 1800 hours and because we had been ordered to continue work on 
 the following day retired to nanalmo camp to spend the night the only serious incident occurred when captain ranger ron 
 bragdon had to pu his skills to use and crawl through a window to unlock the door to the officers 
 mess refreshed by a good night s sleep and wearing clean coveralls a company rejoined the fray at 0800 hours 
 on 11 march and finally won the battle at 1730 hours soaked again the company returned to work point barracks

 84 prairie warfare waincon 72 a company said their farewells to victoria on 5 september and sallied forth to waincon 
 72 with hopes for good weather and top performance as regards the former little needs to be said primarily because 
 fall in wainwright 0:wain 0:wright was typical a touch of all seasons in a four week period however our expectations 
 in regard to training were more than fulfilled rapid progress 0:pro 0:gress was made in section platoon and company tactics 
 and all ranks were able to review old knowledge as well as acquire new skills the climax of the dismounted 
 training was the test exercise panther cl vw in which a company turned in an a one performance as befitting 
 our unbiased grading system additional problems with navigation and control soon appeared when mounted training began but these setbacks were 
 only temporary and commanders 0:com 0:manders and men alike overcame their difficulties and adjusted to their mechanized 0:mech 0:anized role

 85 alpha s annual winter wanderings lt v w kennedy major p a paul hunter heard lt was going to 
 snow again and decided it was time to take a french language course and so began the winter training of 
 a company someone on high let there be a captain a s johnston by name as the newborn company commander 
 whereupon a company went upon the mountain known as lazar in january 1972 and pitched pole on its icy peak 
 thence came the rains regardless the heathen were flooded from the mountain and familiarization with winter training on vancouver island 
 was complete we were ready for chilcotln and ex rapier thrust 11 a company departed for chilcotln with hopes high 
 we pitched camp in the middle of a series of lakes and began tinkering with out toys the apcs two 
 weeks later all the toys broken when we got them were fixed and running mwo wre bruce even had one 
 converted into a field shower for use thereas by company headqjarters as the mechanized force a company had all the 
 cream of the tasks pick up d company here and take them there take these packs up that mountain pick 
 up c company s gear at the hilltop fishing from apcs is fun too we tried it and found that 
 an apc is an excellent ice auger seriously though a company had an interesting time during this year s winter 
 training period despite the fact that winter often seemed more like spring new commanders adjusted to new men and vice 
 a versa although we took our arctic tents into some hideously wet places we preached and learned the fundamentals and

 86 bravo s battles by lt j 8 brooks for bravo company under the command of captain bill ligget at 
 chilcotln in february 1972 the winter warfare training would be combined with training and practice in helicopter operations specifically insertions 
 and extractions the major training problem turned out to be the acquisition of helicopters therefore we often were forced to 
 resort to helicopters of the wheeled variety with chains this meant that b company spent many a long evening by 
 a warm fire awaiting transportation to unite them with their arctic homes the 10 man tent the pace of the 
 exercise after the flight to williams lake and hellborae insertion into a echelon went as planned giving the company the 
 time and opportunity to acclimatize themselves to living and working under winter conditions 0:con 0:ditions however we were to get 
 little co operation from mother nature as regards real winter weather for training the february warm spell not only plagued 
 us and our winter kit wet mukluks being as common place as rp4s but would also create a problem for 
 our company s newest officer who shall remain nameless but nevertheless infamous two of his apcs would break the ice 
 during the company platoon training period this was not a total disaster though as it allowed us the opportunity to 
 practice ice demonlitions and recovery the week of platoon and company training proved to be just what was needed to 
 shape the company into a team and prepare it to perform for the battalion commander to b company the battalion 
 and combat group exercises would come to mean a reserve role in an extended advance to contact with a great 
 deal of advancing and very little contact however bravo company accacted their role as well as the deep impressions a 
 rucksack makes on one s body deeply appreciated was the 3 4 ton vehicle with those cheerful little letters on 
 the side welfare 1 chtlcotln s answer to the welcome wagon as with all good exercises this one ended almost 
 as quickly as lt had begun we had established b company as a needed part of our battalion on exercise

 87 charlie company sub unit training after returning from rapier thrust ii the company went off for a few days 
 well deserved rest and then started on sub unit training these activities 0:acti 0:vities included user trails on the new 
 assault boats a defence exercise on macaulay 0:mac 0:aulay point a guerrilla warfare exercise on galiano island mountaineering training and 
 probably the most interesting was the escape and evasion exercise road runner i the following is an example of what 
 the exericse was like from the evader s point of view one who was captured pte g b erick3om i 
 had managed to make my way to a point just south of duncan before i was captured by an enemy 
 patrol they threw me into the back of a 3 4 ton truck and drove me to a pow camp 
 north of the town once inside the camp my clothes were taken a bag put over my head and my 
 hands tied from here i was taken to work point guardroom and then to the assault pioneer building the old 
 goal where i was held for the next 12 hours the beds were hard and the rooms and winddws were 
 both small making it very hot the guards were very considerate if you called them names or banged on the 
 door they would throw in a cooling pail of water to break our spirit they kept us awake at night 
 by covering our heads with bags and throwing water in our faces combined with this we were interrogated and given 
 propaganda sheets and war crimes confessions to fui out after 12 hoars i decided to leave this happy home and 
 broke out because of the fact that i did manage to escape from the prison i was given my freedom

 72 ptes l j mutter and p d king and myself de bussed from a 3 4 ton truck somewhere 
 in sooke shortly after the vehicle was out of sight we proceeded to a nearby house to enquire as to 
 the best route to get out of the sooke area we were advised to proceed to leechtown 0:leech 0:town a 
 supposedly nice little town a few miles down the railway tracks some 20 miles later a few blisters and quite 
 a few wordis we can to a sign saying leechtown 1 mile we then made plans to purchase some food 
 especially cheese and bread one mile later we entered the remnants of a ghost town having as its single resource 
 a water tap we left this fair metropolis and hungrily dragged down the tracks for a few miles until we 
 heard an aircraft looking up we saw an argus which put us instantly into the woods after his second pass 
 we carried on to the victoria reservoir by this time we were quite disillusioned by our maps which had proven 
 to be of no use leaving the reservoir we came to a farm house the first since sooke the farmer 
 told us the old go to leechtown story this gave us the impression that the civilian population was plotting against 
 us at this point we used our own initiative to guide us to a road sign which indicated we were 
 only a few miles from shawnigan lake realizing that our meager food supply was not going to make lt we 
 stopped at a boy s school where we were given directions to a store the time was now 2000 hrs 
 and the stores were closed but we were given some food by one of the citizens after gulping down this 
 handout we deliberated as to a course of action it was dark damp and chilly and we wandered into a 
 cabin resort to see if we could find some shelter while we were dejectedly sitting there a young wo nan 
 came over and started talking to pte mutter about the exercise we suspected the old leechtown trick but not so 
 we were invited in and although she dida t have much she fed us and gave us a place to 
 spend the night the next morning she woke us with a reveille call fed us breakfast and left for school 
 an hour early to drive us through duncan we passed by the rcmp station at a speed slightly above the 
 lawful limit and were dropped off at a local store here we met a civilian who drove us to the 
 foot of mount prevost and gave us directions to what he thought was a ranger station for the remainder of 
 the day we humped it up the long hard road to the summit of mount prevost finally reaching the top 
 we found the ranger station or rather the remains of it surrounded by snow and fog we decided to proceed 
 cross country and a few hours later arrived back at the bottom the day had been wasted and our stomachs 
 were once again complaining this was when we made our big mistake 0:mis 0:take and headed for the store after 
 buying our food we started out and immediately encountered the enemy the store owner had obviously informed on us we 
 split up and tried to escape but luck had deserted us king was captured as he hid behind a hedge 
 and although mutter clipped by the first policeman the second grabbed him i escaped by charging over three fences which 
 were an obstacle to the police and disappeared in the countryside my tired frame was given extra energy by the 
 sound of barking dogs to the rear thinking of the last food and king and mutter i moved on towards 
 the objective alternately moving and hiding in an attempt to avoid enemy pockets and patrols for a short period i 
 teamed up with another member of the company but we split for the final approach to the junior warden s 
 camp and safety 
 89 waincon 72 shoot out at the ok corral lt r d boettger waincon 72 started with range qualifications for 
 the air party in which a number of c company personnel including at least one platoon commander found they needed 
 more practice once the road party had arrived the battalion moved into the field and began sub unit training in 
 this period section and platoon battle drills were reviewed concentrating primarily on attacks and advance to contact night navigation was 
 practised and all went well except for one syndicate whose compass had a bubble in it also during this period 
 wo wally scharf instructed the officers and senior ncos on target grid procedure 0:pro 0:cedure the rest of the company 
 was instructed on the 60mm mortar and later during the live fire advance to contact the platoon mortarmen fired practice 
 rounds at the balloon and figure ii targets after reviewing the basics the emphasis was shifted to company attacks and 
 advance to contact inter company warfare was reviewed as c coy patrolled against a was attacked by d and put 
 in a night attack on b coy this attack which came after a six hour trek across the wastes found 
 them fast asleep in a well dug ln position reminiscent 0:remini 0:scent of ww i trenches one fact that was 
 firmly imprinted on the minds of all charlie company was that there is no fall season in wainwvight we discovered 
 this alarming condition one morning when upon awakening we found old man winter outside our tent doors unforunately as few 
 of us had packed any winter kit we were not overly prepared for this unwelcome visitor from the north following 
 the company test exercise panther claw and the patrol exercise sabre we started on the battalion and combat group exercises 
 the combat group exercise quick silver began with a relatively dry fording of the battle river followed by a 1000 
 meter march while up to our chests in an ice water swamp later that day we found ourselves in the 
 middle of the badlands prepared for a fight to the death this feeling was a direct result of the enemy 
 situation there was a mechanized company on our right and a dismounted company to our left fortunately a company came 
 to the rescue and the enemy withdrew that night we marched across the badlands to a new defensive position in 
 the southeast arriving in the area in the early morning here we spent the rest of the night freezing and 
 unable to sleep except for the platoon commander 8 platoon who annoyed the company immensely by immediately falling asleep and 
 snoring peacefully until first light as dawn broke we dug in and prepared to defend our position only to be 
 called out to deal with a heliborne assault to our rear we quickly mounted up and dove to the location 
 where we were to meet our guide unfortunately the only guide was the enemy in this case c company of 
 1 ppcli we quickly circled wagons and attacked the attack effectively dealt with the enemy landing but as a senior 
 officer commented it bore a striking resemblance to the shoot out at the ox corral at this point the ceasefire 
 was called and c company prepared to return home home freezer meats quality plus low prices gene s freezer supply

 90 charlies chronicles snowshoe exploits by lt t w loveridge charlie company began the new year with winter training a 
 few miles wast of nanalmo during our vacation in this winter wonderland the company was instructed in tent group routines 
 winter field defences patrolling snowshoeing and cross country skiing unfortunately a sudden change in the weather rendered 0:ren 0:dered the 
 winter gear useless and wet this description could also be applied to the winter soldiers the battalion exercise which followed 
 this exasperating experience indicated that the training had been extremely valuable for the company moved from rocky point to nanalmo 
 in a blinding snowstorm without any vehicle casualties this success was followed by a bridge demolition guard on one of 
 the few routes into the wilds of interior vancouver island all of these earlier exercises were merely skirmishes when compared 
 to rapier thrust 11 this exercise began with much emphasis on the techniques of night navigation and infiltration as practised 
 by the finns at suosualm during the russo flnnish war night after night the werewolves of c company would deposit 
 their tents and stalk the elusive demons of recce platoon as they set up their albis and pps4 a difficult 
 task when you consider that the platoons never knew on which side mwo vardy and the boys from the cp 
 were lcol roy realizing how seriously weakened the enemy were obvious as a result of the great efforts of all 
 ranks ofc company decided to advance naturally 0:na 0:turally due to its great accomplishments in the past the company advanced 
 on the right flank and advanced and advanced for seventeen kilometers the enemy realized that we were the most dangerous 
 foe and continually made futile efforts to halt us aided by es9a our mobile engineer detachment and his machine gun 
 we kept pushing them back until later the next day at this time c company succeeded in holding them long 
 enough for a company to administer the coup de grace with a noteworthy right flanking attack phase three the combat 
 group exercise found us advancing once more very shortly after relieving a tired d company c company became embroiled in 
 a couple of exhaustive fireflghts the second of which resulted in an impressive 0:im 0:pressive mechanized end run around the 
 right flank by a company this operation ensured victory at the nikanee causeway but the war was not over yet 
 the remainder of this first day was spent in a grinding uphill march ending with a confusing night attack by 
 c and d companies which succeeded in capturing the fantasian radar site the next few hours were spent trying to 
 keep warm while waiting for the rations and tents to be shuttled up by apc day two entailed 0:en 0:tailed 
 another advance and this time c company made the circular end run setting up a blocking position which successfully snapped 
 up the enemy who were retreating in front of a company s advance that night a patrol from seven platoon 
 located the enemy defensive positions and captured some prisoners this information enabled our forces to devestate the fantasian troops by 
 means of a battalion attack in which d and c companies assaulted from the left flank at this point all

 soldiers was formed in the summer of 1971 therefore the winter warfare training held up island in addition to being 
 a preparation for rapier thrust ii was the first chance to exercise the company in the field the aim of 
 the excursion was achieved despite the fickle weather of vancouver island which caused numerous 0:nu 0:merous bent tent poles wet 
 parkas and colds the warm january suns resulted in a remarkable metamorphosis powder snow became packed snow which became wet 
 snow which became slush which ended up as mud d company had had enough of winter phase two took place 
 in the chilcotln training area near williams lake b c where the initial period was devoted to company and platoon 
 training this phase went without incident and began to shape the company into a cohesive unit the battalion exercise which 
 followed started and ended without d company firing a shot however the combat group exercise proved to be just the 
 opposite the company held up under the strenuous pace of the advance and on the final battalion attack managed to 
 capture the enemy flag speaking of the combat group exercise one incident will long be remembered by most of the 
 company this was of course the night of the missing foo after returning from ex rapier thrust ii dashing delta 
 was chosen to participate on ex new viking to carry out this task the company was augmented by lt vince 
 kennedy s platoon from a company as well as personnel from the other companies in the battalion a thorough review 
 of winter training on the grass and a rugged pt program put the troops in good condition for the forthcoming 
 two weeks the company departed victoria with 50 f weather and flew to churchill at 10 f a very thorough 
 review of winter operations was completed followed by a three day navigation and movement exercise then north to coral harbour 
 for the final week of navigation and northern living the platoons led by lts brian griffis pat pater son and 
 vince kennedy and company hq struck out on separate routes joining up each night after a long day s trek

 had an interesting 0:in 0:teresting task as the tent grouplcommander for company hq which consisted of one major three captains 
 one mwo john crawford on corporal and one private the highlight of the exercise was the unofficial naming of a 
 lake on the northern limits of the training area lake patricia was discovered on 8 may 72 and was suitably 
 marked with a sign constructed by pte leduc after a lengthy discussion as to the exact grid reference of the 
 spoi a brief ceremony was held by padre swoboda accompanied by a one gun salute fired by the exercise directing

 96 flying duces lt j b brooks our introd action to wainwvight was an indication of things to come that 
 last weekend in victoria had been warm 85 and sunny but the first morning in wainwright was cool 46 and 
 drizzling it was understandable why so many volunteered to accompany the aircraft back to victoria as ballast the first week 
 was spent brushing up on the finer points of marksmanship as the annual classification progressed it became obvious that some 
 in particular the officers were more dangerous to themselves than to the targets the rumour was that there was no 
 forced march competition so we marched out to the ranges each day to make up for it by the week 
 s end not only did we have bruised shoulders and shattered eardrums but sore feet as well sunday known as 
 the day of rest was spent setting up the bivouac area they weren t exactly heated quarters but then this 
 was a summer exercise after all each morning you were forced to remind yourself of that fact the one morning 
 we awoke to find snow on the ground was perhaps the most difficult convincing job of the exercise the company 
 spent two weeks refreshing section and platoon battle drills it took that long for the platoon commanders to finally master 
 their hand and whistle signals the whistle signals proved particularly useful on the field firing range where regardless of the 
 signal it was always a left flanking we were deadly though we have a balloon count to certify to that 
 field firing a very war like d company fire support group during a field firing exercise 
 97 all too soon the training was over and the exercises began the company exercise in the snow and cold 
 was a breeze charlie company proved useful in demonstrating a night attack for our benefit the finer points on how 
 to mount night attacks were noted on we roared through the combat group commander s inspection the shot of rum 
 was well received that day sunday was actually a day of rest that week at least for some monday we 
 were on the battalion exercise rolling reef sharpening our skills for the final push thursday we had the company test 
 exercise panther claw perhaps better known as kitten s nail for its beastliness friday and saturday we set aside for 
 the patrol exercise sabre so finally all was in readiness for the last exercise quick silver sabre brief wo don 
 ethell briefs d company platoon prior to exercise sabre exercise quick silver gave the company its first look at helicopters 
 as helicopter compiny we had done most of our training in those famous flying deuces so dear to the heart 
 of the infantryman our first heliborne assault after the initial confusion proved so successful we were requested to do it 
 again for demonstration purposes after pursuing the illusive enemy force for two days a cease fire was called due to 
 lack of interest after quick de briefings and hurried packing the road party headed back down the yellowhead route for 
 victoria the trip proved quite long particularly the drive from edmonton to chllliwack non stop after a quick shower and 
 breakfast in chilliwack it was on to victoria on arrival in victoria if you could get on the ferry it 
 was hello dear here is my laundry for many of us the air party arrived within hours and waincon 72

 99 officers mess the year 1972 was another year full of activities for the regiments most western officers mess it 
 mads a couple of forays into eastern canada alberta and remained functional if occasionally austere even on these trips major 
 barry winfield continued to chair the mess committee for awhile but cheerfully turned over to captain a s johnston on 
 1 apr 1972 the stalwarts sgt fraser cpls deyotte krazanowski pepper and champion and ptes sanborn and kennedy carried on 
 nonetheless sgt fraser decided to become mr fraser civilian in october and the breach was filled by petty officer murray 
 who quickly and affectionately 0:af 0:fectionately became known as sarge the year s activities started with the levee when we 
 hosted all local regular and reserve force units and visited them in turn levees are a great invention they show 
 you how much the body can take when it really tries january was otherwise quiet but we were fortunate to 
 have the honour of saying goodbye to maj mcklnlay on his retirement from the forces the year went quickly with 
 a busy social calendar that was rudely interrupted 0:inter 0:rupted by numerous exercises and concentrations rather than fortify the mess 
 and defend lt to the last lieutenant we made it mobile and took it with us even though on rapier 
 thrust ii in the chilcotin lt consisted of a 3 4 ton truck sgt fraser and a case of beer 
 the 17th of march celebrations were held in the finest of regimental traditions on friday the officers and senior ncos 
 litterally fought to a draw in booml 100 0:boom 0:l 0:100 no deaths or serious injuries resulted which was really 
 quite amazing considering the enthusiasm shown by both teams and all retired to the officers mess with fat hps or 
 lips on or both for a quiet drink the mess hosted both the sergeants mess and the association and the 
 evening was a noisey success the regimental ball on saturday was well attended and as usual fun was had by 
 all spring became summer we believe it occurred late one vpers in march and we moved outside on 7 may 
 we held a pleasant garden tea with the association 0:asso 0:ciation following our church parade to commemorate the battle of 
 frezenberg many visitors popped in to say hello during april and may including bgen hamilton we were glad to see 
 them all and entertained them in our pleasant surroundings the mess moved to wainwright for milcon 72 night attacks fighting 
 patrols and skirmishes occurred all up and down the line as the messes of the three patricia battalions practiced offensive 
 operations a rumour was heard that the commander will never again put three battalion s of patricia s on the 
 same road all within a few miles of each other the militia officers joined us and acquaintances 0:acquain 0:tances were 
 made or renewed the concentration was a success and the mess moved back to sunny victoria in early july battalion 
 officers were coming and going all summer as the various commitments 0:commit 0:ments demanded but we quickly regrouped at the 
 end of august before our next trip across the rockies waincon 72 found us back in our old bivouac area 
 changed only by the fresh calling cards left by our predecessors the cattle we discovered a climatic condition rarely found 
 in victoria winter temperatures 0:temp 0:eratures fell beer sales fell off so a sound military decision was made to move 
 into main camp this event took place after the commander bgen brown joined us for lunch we co located with 
 the sergeants mess and watched team canada whump the russians without worrying whose turn it was to have the herman 
 nelson we were back in victoria by thanksgiving and quickly put our tattered social calendar back in shape we entertained 
 ltgen turcot during his farewell visit maj gen talbot queen s own buffs the esqulmaltmunlclpal cornell and generally had a 
 splendid time the canadian land forces command and staff college foreign students and their wives joined us for a buffet 
 dinner during the college s annual visit two beautiful moose roasts compliments of captains ken nette and barry worth were

 that good music good food and good company added up to an excellent function early in september the mess sat 
 down to dine and mug out rsm bill carlton posted to vancouver and to say farewell to wos ethell and 
 bob halpin on the occasion of their acceptance for commissioning although many mess members were absent on duty at the 
 time those present did a superb job of bidding farewell to three fine members following this were bingos social nights 
 candlelight dinners games nights and then the new year s ball and it was a gala formal affair that did 
 credit to the planning and work of the entire entertainment committee on the sports scene the mess fared reasonably well 
 at the annual brooma loo 0:broom 0:a 0:loo game in march we allowed the officers to tie the score and 
 win then collaborated with the enemy team and their supporters in the officers mess after the game there was a

 season draws to a close the junior ranks club team is tied for first place if the trophy isn t 
 part of the club s silverware when the final bell rings at least our presence in the league will have 
 been noted in view of this fine performance all team members and especially coach mcpl jack white deserve a hearty 
 well done during the summer months all ranks were havily committed to various tasks this included the staff of the 
 junior ranks club and the bar manager cpl todd barnes who met the demands of the summer employment very well 
 milcon found the club set up in the bright and picturesque surroundings of the wainwright training area this was soon 
 followed by ssep and a large mess in the albert head camp these two messes proved very successful but there 
 is no rest for the weary as the fall combat group concentration in wainwright proved once again the junior ranks 
 club was operating in the field well not quite in the field this time there were no ropes or pegs 
 the club was established 0:es 0:tablished in a real building no 174 in main camp the month of august saw

 the new year s celebration and wheels again went into motion the party went off well even though the financial 
 side wasn t as good as it should have been but all in all 1973 came in very happily january 
 was noteworthy due to the arrival of friends and comrades in arms from the northwestern tip of north america alaska 
 to be precise these troops from company b l 60th infantry 172 light arctic infantry brigade were welcomed 0:wel 0:comed 
 in true patricia fashion both at the mess and later friendships were rapidly cemented and when ex queen s ransom

 back to sunny victoria where on the sixth of july we started playing for the arrivals and departures of the

 august and according to mr lane head of the victoria visitor s bureau we were instrumental my terrible pun not

 the month of agust included an afternoon at hmc dockyard playing for the navy regatta the final seep parades both 
 in victoria and vancouver and on the thirtieth a change over parade and mess dinner that heralded a tenure worthy 
 of some note while in vancouver for the seep parade we were invited to play a short concert at the 
 armed forces pavilion of the p n e on the sixteenth of september the armed forces were granted the freedom 
 of the municipality of esquimau the corps of drums took part in this ceremony along with ths naden band and

 has been said to those who have departed major road moves were among the largest operations supported by this company 
 during the past year the moves started last january with a battalion move to the nanalmo lakes district under hazardous 
 road conditions and ending with the battalion taking part in waincon 72 during sep oct without a doubt the drivers 
 of this unit put on more miles than any other field unit in western canada and in so doing compiled 
 a most enviable safety record herewith a most deserved pat on the back to our drivers in order to ensure 
 that all our wheels were able to get to their destinations the maintenance platoon found it necessary to work many 
 long days and nights this oft forgotten group of miracle workers used everything including bubblegum 0:bubble 0:gum and baling wire 
 to keep our middle aged vehicles operational the maintainers also earna bouquet for construction of the flying kitchens in co 
 operation with the pioneer trades section they built two of these mobile mess halls and everyone in the unit has 
 reaped the benefits they saw use on all our major exercises during the year from chilcotln to wainwright as imitation 
 is said to be the most sincere form of flattery those responsible for the flying kitchens will be pleased to 
 know that the other units of the combat group are now producing similar models let us not forget those members 
 of the company who operated the kitchens flying and otherwise our small band of cooks excelled themselves in chilcotin on 
 the regimental birthday at milcon and waincon during the christmas festivities and day after day in all the unit messes 
 under all conditions the quality of the meals they produced has earned them many compliments lakeview bakery large variety of

 112 mortar mountings wo r c moore a new year and a new challenge to the battalion mortar platoon a 
 challenge in that the platoon had commitments that were interesting and for those who liked to travel would allow return 
 visits to such well known tourist areas as chilcotin shilo and fort lewis washington without boring the reader on the 
 actual training aspects of chilcotin we ll indulge briefly in some of the field firing exercises which we all found 
 most enlightening mainly because live shoots tend to be closer to the actual thing a close knit relationship with our 
 battalion artillery support j battery 3 rcha shilo man was quickly developed this co operation benefitted all and the teamwork 
 carried over into the wainwright exercises where we again had the privilege of working with this fine battery fort lewis 
 was an excellent training area for the mortars here the platoon practised all the phases of war as they pertain 
 to the employment and occupation of mortar positions our mortarmen acting in a diplomatic role as ambassadors for canada left 
 lam sure lasting memories in the social circles of the fort lewis and immediate washington area wainwright was upon us 
 again general preparations including the loading of stores equipment and mortars were completed and we were ready to depart for 
 vacationland western canada the move to the training area wainwright was a three phase operation this year first to depart 
 was the air party followed the next day by the road party and lastly the remainder of us who participated 
 in the freedom of esqulmalt ceremony arriving in wainwright by air a week later mortar mounts what do you mean 
 there is already one bomb in there 
 113 the mortar platoon began training in earnest after the combat group sports day with the arrival of the last 
 of the platoon from victoria one of our most formidable endeavours was to ready the platoon and its new mortarmen 
 for the combat group fire planning course this was a two day effort in which selected officers of the combat 
 group planned and called down fire for their companies under the critical and always watchful eye of major scott j 
 battery commander the mortars came through with flying colours one factor in our success was the new british ammunition which 
 was a training stanchion unparalleled a well done to all of the big ms who participated despite this pat on 
 the back there was no rest for some selected ncos who had volunteered to be on the umpire and control 
 staffs for the various test exercises b company commander major english had the foresight to know where all the latrine 
 tacticians were located a downright sneaky underhanded 0:under 0:handed unpredlcatble bunch of characters he persuaded hq company commander 0:com 0:mander 
 major kent foster to release this hoarct mortar platoon against his company as enemy force in a prelude to the 
 company test exercise we must agree that it was a mexican stand off if only because they wouldn t allow 
 us to bite noses scratch and kick seriously lam sure it was excellent training for b company and a first 
 rate refresher for mortars it seems for all who enjoy field work that time marches on only too quickly the 
 final exercise quick silver was soon over and we found ourselves preparing once again for that long trek home the 
 move back was uneventful as all well planned and co ordinated moves are and upon arrival in victoria all ranks 
 were off to loved ones and a thanksgiving weekend after an enjoyable holiday there was the colossal taks of sorting 
 out stores equipment and training aids for our last major task of the 1972 training programme the battalion pl 4 
 mortar courses due to the planning and preparation and the excellent selection of instructors this course was one of the 
 best yet run within the battalion learning through guidance instruction and example was our motto this year we had been

 checked and readied for a platoon exercise which took place on upper vancouver island in the green mountain area here 
 the platoon was tasked with reconnolterlng various areas for the proposed battalion exercise which was to take place later in 
 the month of january along with conducting a reconnaissance of the area the platoon also had the opportunity to check 
 out the winter equipment for serviceability 0:ser 0:viceability as well as practising the required skiing and snowshoelng techniques encountering and 
 correcting winter communications problems as well as once more being exposed to the hazards and hardships of winter road moves 
 prior to departing for ex rapier thrust ii in chilcotin british columbia the battalion went on a three day exercise 
 into the green mountain area due to the snow conditions several platoon vehicles required minor repairs prior to departing for 
 the british columbia interior but with the unit rceme working long hard hours the platoon was able to depart victoria 
 with its full complement of vehicles due to a request from the canadian forces officer candidate school at cfb chilliwack 
 for the battalion to provide a support weapons display capt jerry jensen along with representatives from each of the support 
 weapons platoons departed victoria a day prior to the main road party in order to set up the display this 
 display party joined the main force of the road party the following night and early the next morning all of 
 the battalion road party departed for williams lake and the chucotin training area during the company and battalion training phases 
 the platoon was primarily employed as two specific teams with the patrol section under capt jay lapeyre s 0:la 0:peyre 
 0:s direction being used as the enemy force against the rifle companies and the recce platoon surveiuance sections under the 
 supervision of sgt harry lloy being used as friendly observation teams during the battalion exercise these roles were reversed and 
 contrary to some beliefs the two opposing elements were not collaborating in fact this opposing role started some keen and 
 enthusiastic competition with both sides trying to capture their platoon counterparts during the 1 combat group exercise both the patrol 
 and surveiuance elements were actively employed by the commanding officer much to the discomfort of the enemy force commander at 
 the completion of the exercise the majority of the platoon moved back to victoria with the road party as experienced 
 drivers were in great demand considering that the fraser canyon would have to be negotiated by these drivers during the 
 mid february period on arrival in victoria the platoon cleaned and stored the equipment used during the exercise prior to 
 taking some time off as designated by the commanding 0:com 0:manding officer upon returning to work plans were made for 
 the march april may and june employment of the platoon these plans materialized and the recce platoon mountaineering staff conducted 
 a mountain familiarization 0:familiari 0:zation programme for approximately twenty two grade seven and eight students from the john stubbs memorial 
 school in belmont park during the month of march during this time and with the arrival of capt r p

 sufficient rope bridging and mountaineering equipment to conduct two basic mountaineer courses for b and c companies respectively these courses 
 were divided into two phases with the first phase being conducted at the sooke pot holes on southern vancouver island 
 where two one week courses were run on rope bridging after the first weekend in may the complete platoon along 
 with b comoany moved to a tented camp location in strathcona park about 200 miles north of victoria to conduct 
 the second phase of the patrolling and mountaineering school on the completion of the two week training cycle a skeleton 
 staff was left in the buttle lake camp area and the remainder of the platoon and company personnel moved back 
 to victoria for re supply of equipment and rest prior to moving back to buttle lake with c company the 
 following week unfortunately only one week was spent training in buttle lake this time as battalion commitments 0:commit 0:ments required 
 both c company and platoon personnel back in victoria for armed forces day on 10 jun 72 accordingly the camp 
 complex at buttle lake was pulled down on 4 jun 72 and everyone moved back to work point barracks in 
 victoria to prepare for the armed forces day activities even though the training cycle was reduced by one week a

 sign 71 c was briefed to ferry delta company across the battle river at various locations after two successful crossings 
 we were approaching the area of the third and last when the excitment really started unkown to us the river 
 had suddently become shallow and we ran aground on a rock sand bar crew overboard 0:over 0:board to dislodge boat 
 was the order and after we had scrambled back aboard this was followed by where the hell is that push 
 pole unfortunately the rce s omitted paddles in our equipment but as pioneers improvisation is our motto and so our 
 tamping poles were put to good use as push poles we were off again but the man who was propelling 
 with the tamping pole let go and away it floated now i hate to lose equipment even if it is 
 just a wooden tamping pole so thinking it was still shallow water i bravely jumped overboard into a 60 foot 
 hole well it felt that deep would you believe 10 feet being a non swimmer i thanked god for my 
 life jacket and surfaced just in time to grab the arms held out to me as the boat continued on 
 downstream this welcome assistance was given by cpl fleck and pte snea two very alert men who pulled me back 
 into the boat well this is one of the experiences of a soldier who took a swim at 2 a

 on the next crossing never to be found again but guess what we found washed ashore 3 000 meters downstream

 120 3ppcli with the militia major j a english although regular force assistance to the militia has long been a 
 feature of the canadian forces it is currently receiving greater attention than ever before particularly at unit level nowhere is 
 this trend more apparent than in 1 combat group where regular force units have been officially affiliated with designated militia 
 units of prairie and pacific muitla areas in the case of the 3rd battalion 0:bat 0:talion princess patricia s canadian 
 light infantry this affiliation is with the royal westminster regiment at new westminster the seaforth highlanders of canada at vancouver 
 the rockey mountain rangers at kamjoops and the canadian scottish regiment princess mary s at victoria this year 3rd patricia 
 s were requested to provide their respective affiliated units with the latest information on infantry weapons equipment and field operating 
 0:oper 0:ating procedures the response of the battalion commander lcol p a roy was to dispatch a muitla briefing team 
 of nineteen vehicles and fifty six all ranks to visit the affiliated muitla units the briefing program which covered a 
 fuu working day commenced with a static display of all equipment weapons surveulance devices and radios held by an infantry 
 battalion during the display crash action druls were demonstrated 0:demon 0:strated by trained anti tank and mortar crews on the 
 106 mm recouless rifle and 81mm mortar respectively militia personnel were also exposed to battalion 0:bat 0:talion and rifle company 
 command post complexes which formed an important part of the display the static display was followed by a cloth model 
 presentation 0:presen 0:tation emphasizing battle procedure and outlining the field standing operating procedures of 3 ppcli after the cloth model 
 presentation muitla unit personnel 0:per 0:sonnel attending were divided into three groups according to rank officers to receive a detaued 
 briefing on command post procedures at battalion level senior ncos to receive a lecture on the duties of senior ncos 
 in the field and corporals and privates to view films and watch a demonstration of infantry section battle druls during 
 the afternoon the officers and certain senior ncos participated in a command post exercise cpx according to all reports this 
 was the best received 0:re 0:ceived single event of the briefing program while the cpx was in progress the remaining 
 senior ncos corporals and privates carried out crash action druls on the 106 mm recouless rifle and the bimm mortar 
 they were also given the opportunity to operate battalion surveulance equipment and to practice calling down mortar fire simulated by 
 the pneumatic attachment to the 81mm mortar perhaps the most impressive event of the program was the mountaineering demonstration which 
 served as a finale under the direction of captains ron bragdon and ross mulward team members demonstrated from the top 
 of armouries or drill halls the various methods of rappelling down a vertical surface ending with the australian rappel the 
 success of the briefing was in part evidenced by the healthy turnout of militia personnel in kamjoops the rocky mountain 
 rangers fielded approximately 0:approxi 0:mately forty five personnel from as far away as revelstoke the westminster regiment arrived about sixty 
 five strong and the seaforth highlanders paraded forty five not counting corporals and privates in victoria the canadian scottish passed 
 the word to other local units and cadet corps and the briefing at bay street armoury in downtown victoria was 
 thus attended by around one hundred militia and cadet personnel the true significance of the briefing however was best described 
 by colonel d j anderson commander vancouver militia district who stated that it is only through this kind of sharing 
 of knowledge that the militia will be able to keep up with the many changes that happen to our corps

 125 the pig war lt r d bosttger the canadian american border may now be the longest undefended border in 
 the world but lt was not alwasy that way during the nineteenth century the bugles of war sounded many times 
 along our southern frontier some of these alarms led to actual combat such as the war of 1812 or the 
 fenian raids of the late 1860 s and early 1870 s but in many military involvement was restricted to showing 
 the flag the pig war falls into the latter category since it was not really a war but rather a 
 dispute the san juan islands boundary dispute which is a more descriptive title for the affair resulted from the faulty 
 geographic knowledge of the drafters of the oregon treaty in that agreement the canadian american boundary was set as the 
 line from the point where the 49th parallel touched the sea through the middle of the channel separating vancouver island 
 from the mainland unfortunately this channel was occupied by numerous islands valuable to both sides as they strategically controlled 0:con 
 0:trolled the inland passage the hudson s bay company had established a post on the largest of these islands san 
 juan in 1845 and had been joined by several shepherds the first incident in the conflict occurred in 1855 when 
 a united states sheriff seized thirty four breeding rams in lieu of the taxes that the hudson s bay company 
 refused to pay when the dust settled from this opening move both sides agreed to avoid further clashes until the 
 boundary was settled apparently everyone on the island was not briefed on this agreement because in 1859 an american squatter 
 shot a pig belonging to the hudson s bay company tnis so aroused the british that a magistrate was sent 
 to san juan on the corvette 0:cor 0:vette satellite meanwhile sixty american soldiers landed on the disputed real estate the 
 british reaction to this affront took the form of his majesty s ship tribune which had orders to prevent any 
 future landings before a real flare up could occur a joint occupation was arranged which was destined to last until 
 the emperor of germany kaiser wllhelm i arbitrated the decision in favour of the americans in 1872 to celebrate the 
 centennary of the end of the pig war various dignitaries and descendants of participants as well as military contingents from 
 canada and the united states of america attended a ceremony at english camp san juan islands on 21 oct 72 
 this camp now a national park was the site of the royal marine garrison during the occupation the united states 
 contingent led the troops into the camp area and when all were in position the combined force presented arm as 
 the national anthems of great britian canada germany and the united states were played following this a united states navy 
 drill team performed followed by the corps of drums of the third battalion princess patricia s canadian light infantry who 
 presented their stick drill routine upon ths conclusion of this portion of the ceremony various dignitaries commented on the centennary 
 and the historical background of the event the speakers were followed by the gun crew of hmcs ma laha t 
 naval reserve sqaadron from victoria who fired a salute as the british flag was lowered at this point the corps 
 of drums took post at the head of the combined 0:com 0:bined contingents and led the march past to end

 dutch held a large tattoo while in holland many of the band members visited the cemetaries in this area our 
 concert band was very busy this past year with school concerts and many out of town engagements one of the 
 more prominent concerts during the year was held in the jubilee auditorium calgary in conjunction with the band of 2

 capt bob tetz gave up the idea of walking around wainwright with 2 commando so joined 2 ppcli and now

 has decided to offer his expertise to the regimental emplaning officer and his shop some other old or ex patricias

 qor of c took over the reins of 1 airborne se vice company csm reminds him so much of hq 
 company a great number of promotions have taken place over the year particularly in the cpl mcpl and sergeant ranks 
 in most cases they are too numerous to list however some of those promoted to the senior nco rank were 
 sergeants danylenko peskitt prouse and schuler the 17th of march found many of the patricias celebrating their day on the 
 beaches of jamaica in addition exercise nimrod caper iv saw a band of eager patricias exploring the wilds of rural 
 jamaica not all of the exercise was fun and games as cpl gariepy found out the hard way on a 
 jump into alligator 0:alli 0:gator farm 2 cdo hq while in jamaica no alligators in sight but hard hard ground 
 as did mwo gerry rogers when he broke out in an itch closely resembling 0:re 0:sembling leprosy but all in 
 all sea breezes sunny skies and a choice selection 0:sele 0:ction of bananas coconuts limes and rum amply repaid all 
 the hard work also another phase of the exercise nearly resulted in reclassification of capt bob tetz and wo ed 
 witt as submariners for their exploits on a bamboo raft on the rio grande river 2 commando was still unpacking 
 from jamaica when f coy departed for wainwright to construct the regimental battle school the school was a great success 
 with the company defensive position much refurbished under the supervision 0:super 0:vision of aspiring patricia capt gus bonnycastle presently rcr 
 ex black watch ably assisted by then mcpl joe danylenko in addition another major 
 145 construction project was completed that cherished project of major bob stewart the park farm village fighting complex during the 
 battle school lt received enough work and rounds to justify all the labour that went into it over the summer 
 2 commando remained active with adventure training mountain school and an exercise in alaska during the summer many faces changed 
 major dick cowling took over the commando while somewhere in the shuffle captain brent mcdonald took over hq company captain 
 mike mckewn became operations officer and captain ralph mcdiarmid set himself up as intelligence officer unit emplaning officer public relations 
 officer and a number of lesser positions at the same time captain a j sandy mac donald from the combat 
 arms school took over d company with wo ed witt as his csm exercise ready now ll was the first 
 exercise with the new team for two weeks the commando fought to destroy a band of terrorists drawn from 1 
 ppcli ably commanded by captain bob kompff subversion was well withing the scope of the exercise and at one point 
 cpl glenn piper wis planted in the pw cage to pick up any loose talk as will be noted by 
 those in attendance finding terrorists to put in the bag can be a very frustrating experience after one day s 
 particularly good pickings including the enemy s hq things became a little tougher for example captain emery french while checking 
 his area of responsibuity unpleasant swamp in search of an elusive enemy the walk back from fort asslnlboine is not 
 a fond memory in most minds but a number of promotions eased the pain one such was the promotion of 
 cpl j b boots macdonald to mcpl his many admirers will be reassured to know that corporal boots as he 
 is known in jamaica did not appear unduly impressed 0:im 0:pressed the blisters were stiu throbbing when exercise pegasus strike 
 ll commenced 0:com 0:menced this was a patrol type exercise attempted by each platoon in succession 0:suc 0:cession when the 
 dust settled 7 platoon commanded by captain rag duncan was adjudged the winner november saw a program of winter refresher 
 training including a visit to wainwright the weatherman was uncooperative and the result was some almost 0:al 0:most tropical winter 
 indoctrination early december brought exercise nomadic hunter and two weeks of training in churchul due to high winds the commando 
 was unable to jump in and had to settle for airlanding what followed was a short winter exercise and a 
 week of unit and sub unit training captain brent mcdonald built a first class range on the shores of hudson 
 bay which everyone used continuation cfac i c lg r s brand of radio 
 146 parachuting was practiced and on one such jump pte kelrt pont parted with his mukluk somewhere in mid air 
 to our knowledge the mukluk has not been seen since so if you happen to be in churchill and run 
 across a lonely looking mukluk just during january the regiment was visited by an old patricia mgen stan waters colonel 
 of the regiment and mgen mllroy respectively following upon the heels of these visits was exercise queens ransom run by 
 1 combat group 2 commando was again the good guys while 1 commando played the enemy force major dick cowling 
 still insists that it wasn t him telling his companies to slow down and let the mech units on his 
 flanks catch up he says they re fast but they re not that fast the return to garrison was looked 
 forward too however after a few weeks of rest with only pay level 4 training and other unit courses 2 
 commando is again taking off to cold lake to finish off their winter training in april its off to wainwright 
 for annual classification and internal security training this summer will see presentation and trooping the colours for the commandos an 
 exercise in tofino 8 c mountain school and preparation for a desert warfare exercise in southern california the presentation of 
 colours and trooping ceremonies to 1 and 2 commandos will take place on 9 june 1973 all ex members of 
 the regiment are heartily invited to attend during the same time frame lt is expected that the 1 canadian parachute 
 battalion and the first special service force will hold their reunion in edmonton so for all you other patricias that

 canadian mechanized commando wish to extend their best wishes and greetings to our regimental comrades in arms both in canada 
 and on duty abroad we are enjoying 0:en 0:joying soldiering in europe but nevertheless we look forward to returning to 
 patricia regimental duty to renew old acquaintances not all patricias may be aware of 3 mech cdo s brief but 
 colourful history location and role founded on 28 june 1970 in sennelager federal republic of germany we were the product 
 of a meld of 2 rcr who were at that time stationed at fort york and 2 ppcli from fort 
 mcleod this unlikely union was understandably received with apprehension but this has disappeared because of the professional attitude displayed by 
 all ranks considered by some to be fatherless we assure you that that idea is a myth rather we believe 
 we are the best in europe specifically because many of our ranks are from the best in canada during the 
 fall of 1970 4 canadian mechanized brigade group was renamed 4 canadian mechanized battle group 3 mech cdo as part 
 of the battle group retired from westphalia in northern germany and moved to a new garrison location in southern germany 
 s black forest region at baden soelllngen situated 0:situ 0:ated less than a mile from the banks of the river 
 rhine our close proximity to france and relative nearness to switzerland about 2 hours away by autobahn indeed places us 
 in good stead for weekend outings and travel further because we are the only unit of 4 cmbg located at 
 baden soelllngen we enjoy relative privacy and spacious accommodation unlike most of the remainder of the battle group situated at 
 lahr nevertheless our location does have one main disadvantage we are a baden lodger unit outnumbered by the bulk of 
 1 canadian air group 1 cag for those unaccustomed to the screaming howl of a cf 104 engine during take 
 off noise intensity levels sometimes reach the pain threshold and invariably interrupt 0:inter 0:rupt conversation parades inspections and command post

 natrually appropriate thoughts and physical gestures are conveyed to our light blue comrades during these periods although reduced in size 
 and re located our battle group is still considered to be a formidable force not to be taken lightly man

 153 the royal green jackets our last notes recorded two major events which had been predominant in regimental life through 
 1971 these were the reduction of 3 rgj to company strength and the crisis in northern ireland the first of 
 these two major events has now been most happily reversed but the second is still with us in fact the 
 reduction of 3 rgj had only just been completed when it was announced that the battalion was to be re 
 formed as soon as possible the new battalion came into existence officially on the 15th of january 1972 and started 
 a tour in northern ireland last august at the time of writing all three rgj battalions are operating in northern 
 ireland 2 rgj are carrying out a normal tour at limavady if any tour of northern ireland can be described 
 as normal and 1 and 3 rgj deployed on emergency tours from their normal stations in celle baor and shoeburyness 
 respectively 2 rgj are due to be relieved in march and are expected to move to catterick it would be 
 inappropriate in these notes not to include a mention of r company this representative company formed from the re organization 
 of 3 rgj was in existence for much less than a year before being re absorbed into the new 3 
 rgj during this very short period they earned for themselves a very high reputation during operations in northern ireland and 
 their title r company is now perpetuated as one of the rifle companies in 3 rgj the rifle depot is 
 full to bursting point with recruits and the reformation of 3 rgj has produced an insatiable demand for men the 
 4th volunteer battalion continues to increase in strength and this year carries out it s annual camp in baor during 
 the current operations in northern ireland royal green jackets have earned the following awards cbe 2 dso 1 mbe 2 
 mc 4 dcm lj mm 1 mention in despatches 10 as a result of operations in northern ireland to date 
 one officer has died of wounds and six riflemen have been killed many others have been wounded it may be 
 appropriate to record here that four officers and four riflemen from the royal green jackets carried out an expedition to 
 nepal lasting from november 1971 to january 1972 the object of the expedition was two fold first to trek for 
 ten days in the hills of eastern nepal and second to collect as many bugs and butterflies for the british 
 museum as possible in three weeks subsequently 0:subse 0:quently the plan was to trek westwards to katmandu a walk of 
 about 350 miles taking three and a half weeks the party was drawn from all three battalions

 155 2481 red lake cadet corps the 25th of april 1971 was a day that will be long remembered by 
 the red lake cadet corps on that sunday evening a ceremonial parade was held to mark the official recognition of 
 this corps as being affiliated with princess patricia s canadian light infantry it was the culmination of a fairly lengthy 
 period of negotiation and preceeded by some strenuous drill preparation the outcome of which was an excellent performance by the 
 cadets of this fledgling member of the patricias it was through the energy of mr leo gauthler himself a former 
 patricia and at that time commanding officer of the corps that we were able to achieve this milestone in the 
 corps history the corps was originally fornfed in 1953 with mr e carolyn as it s chief instructor a title 
 which was later to become commanding officer he served until 1960 mr a j kacan assumed command in 1960 and 
 in 1969 handed the corps over to capt leo gauthler the present commanding officer capt d m whitehead took over 
 command on the ist of january 1971 and is still serving in that capacity branch 102 royal canadian legion are 
 the sponsors of the corps and have been more than co operative in assisting in all activities during the past 
 year the corps has taken part in a series of varied activities which included the distribution of poppies for rememberance 
 day and taking part in related ceremonies snowmobile exercises with safety training being the aim hunter safety course an exercise 
 at cfb shuo with our sister corps from 2 ppcli citizenship tour to thunder bay safe driving and civil law

 161 to the unknown soldier by a sydney bruneau q c in memory of private daniel mclean no 22936 who 
 died of wounds at dranoutre on january 10th 1916 the first time i saw daniel mclean we were in the 
 trenches at armentieres just after the first of the re lnforcements from canadian universities had reached the ppcli dan was 
 a scotsman certainly over forty strongly built with yellowish hair and mild blue eyes who out of the line was 
 always among the first to appear in the orderly room for being drunk and disorderly and spent most of his 
 time in the clink but once in the trenches and free from temptation he was a model soldier and a 
 great favourite with everyone particularly the college boys in whom he took a kindly and almost fatherly interest at the 
 time we felt that discipline could be relaxed with advantage in the front line here at least we should not 
 be plagued with too many inspections of our rifles and persons dan was on sentry dity when the orderly officer 
 of the day reached his post well dan he said pleasantly as the sentry saluted have you seen anything to 
 day yis sor was the laconic answer the lieutenant s interest was roused and what was that i saw a 
 german staff officer come out of the trenches and walk along the parapet and look at us through his fieldglasses 
 0:field 0:glasses and did you take a shot at him no sor good heavens why not five minutes before rifle 
 inspection sor those of us who were standing around were simply gasping with delight at the skill with which the 
 old reprobate could handle the officer and deliver his lesson without giving the slightest offence needless to say the inspection 
 of that day was of the most perfuactory character i glimpsed a little more of dan in the next few 
 weeks his riotous drunkenness in the course o c which he tumbled into a fire that charred and blackened his 
 uniform and on another occasion accepted a chllenge to swim through a horsepond 0:horse 0:pond which did not improve the 
 colour of the khaki dan resolutely refused to ask for a new uniform he had done so once but the 
 quarter master sergeant turned him down in a niggardly moment and he had vowed that he would never ask for 
 one again they would have to bring it to him and in fact they at last had to beg him 
 to call and be refitted for the credit of the regiment it was amusing too to see his studied evasion 
 of the brigade chaplain who had delected something worth saving in the old soldier whenever he saw him it was 
 so help me dur r rty jesus here s the chaplain and he would search the skies for airplaines utterly 
 oblivious to the good natu red old parson who was trying to capture his attention and possibly his sou at 
 the end of september 1915 wj were taking over part of the french line on the somme and on the 
 way up to the trenches were billeted for a couple of days at cappy where dan paid our section a 
 social call at the end of the day after a few drinks it was one of his special pleasures to 
 assume the duties of an orderly officer and to make sure that the boys were all comfortable it possibly be 
 that he had once done so in reality this time he ms de a speech if i gave expression to 
 my ideas he said i would revolutionise the world of course we laughed at him but i could not help 
 thinking of shelley when he went on to say that this had been his passion when he was a youth 
 like us if he ever got back to canada he would be happy now if ha could open a pub 
 and call it the lone stripe as he would do if he ever reached the present summit of his ambition 
 to be a lance corporal some day he intended to preach u s a grand sermoi for as he inform 
 el us he had been brought up among theoretical presbyterians prehistoric men at such moments he had a fondness for 
 twisting his tongue around pdlysyllables of which he had a rich vocabulary which he could use with astonishing aptness 
 162 in our next trench spell we found that he had another weakness he could not face rats if we 
 were left without a candle in our dug out we could hear them scurrying and tumbling all around us my 
 balaclava cap was chewed right through dan insisted on sleeping outdoors in the trench on the fire step when we 
 joined the canadians we were billeted for twenty four days in a barn at fletre while headquarters decided how we 
 could be fitted in and here i happened to sleep beside dan and acquaintance ripened into something like friendship as 
 we indulged in many an interesting conversation before turning over to sleep i made the discovery that dan was one 
 of the best educated men in the regiment in the real sense of the word he read his papers carefully 
 his political and military comments were well thought out and delivered with modesty but with an authority that showed that 
 he must at one time have been a keen student of history and would have made a splendid lecturer he 
 understood 0:under 0:stood the background of the countries engaged in the war he had no illusions about the seriousness of 
 the struggle and its after effects he did not see how success could be achieved by such attacks as had 
 just taken place the preceding bombardment gave ample warning for the enemy to rush their reserves to the point attacked 
 he thought that a thrust at some commanding point might do it and force a retirement along the whole line 
 but only if at the same time the enemy were kept busy on every front on a larger scale than 
 had been tried yet if the war continued on its present lines it might be a matter of years before 
 one side or the other gave out i was reading the other day these ideas of his expressed in my 
 letters sent home early in 1916 and was surprised to find how closely he had anticipated the final solution of 
 1918 he could tell a story too with a literary touch and i wish i had learnt steography to enable 
 me to take down verbatim his account of the famous bth of may as he had seen it what follows 
 can only give a faint suggestion 0:sugges 0:tion of the vividness of his narrative powers it began with a lovely 
 sunrise and the glory of a may morning after the trying diys they had been through it was so good 
 just to be alive that dan forgot to wake ud his relief and remained on guard alone after stand to 
 to enjoy the peace of the morning till sam jones who drank so hard that he scarcely knew the taste 
 of food tumbled out for breakfast between them they cooked a tin of maconochie meat with vegetables and sam swore 
 he had never tasted anything so good it was then that three planes came over from the german lines and 
 circling over the trench dropped smoke bombs pretty little white puffs in the cloudless sky directly overhead dan sensed that 
 something was about to happen and woke up the others the planes returned as they had come and they were 
 scarcely out of sight when as dan put lt blng bang bingo this was the worst yet a sergeant came 
 running up to get two men to man and repair a ruined traverse and dan volunteered 0:volun 0:teered with the 
 hard drinking sam who was shaking his head and could find nothing to say but this isn t war they 
 found a section of the parapet crumbled away and the sergeant left them with a few others telling them to 
 make themselves comfortable they passed the time filling sandoags and trying to repair the damage the planes came over again 
 and dropped their puffs over the very traverse in which they were standing and then a shell burst in front 
 of them and another behind and a moment later dan was shaken by a concussion sam twisted about in a 
 circle and pitched to the grouid holding his side jesus christ i ve got lt was au he had tlnu 
 to say and he was dead at once the last shell had fallen between them taking one and leaving the 
 other and so lt went on for hours till the trench was obliterated the corporal who was lying on the 
 ground wounded was struck again and his leg carried away i m done now dan he said never say that 
 corporal dan answered but he knew that the man had no more than minutes to live one of the youngsters 
 a good lad was lying in the corner in agony dying slowly and rambling about his mother the word was 
 passed along to retire but the sergeant would not accept the order without knowing who had given it we won 
 t retire he said 
 163 and then unfortunately for he never referred to the battle again dan s story was interrupted by lights out 
 and he brought lt to an abrupt close omitting all that intervened and the end of lt all he said 
 was when i found myself with an officer from some other regiment in a communication trench with one boot lost 
 no pack no hat nothing but me rifle there was a bad break in the communication trench where the german 
 snipers had trained their guns but dan knew better than to walk over he dived forward headfirst to land into 
 the trench on the other side his rifle was clogged with mud but he was safely out of it it 
 was as much of the battle as one man had been able to see and no more but given with 
 a power of painting a picture in a word that brought vividly to his hearers all the bewilderment and utter 
 helplessness of the day it was worthy to have stood beside stendhal s description of waterloo in the charterhouse of 
 parma if only his words could have been preserved but generally dan could not be induced to talk of himself 
 he seemed to have placed a guard over his tongue it was only from his fatherly interest in the younger 
 soldiers and an occasional remark that i wondered if he had not somewhere 0:some 0:where a son to be proud 
 of perhaps an officer in the army there was just the merest hint of that and that he had not 
 always led the life of a vagrant i never solved his mystery nor did anyone else as far as i 
 know who was he where did he come from did anyone care for him he was nothing but the unkowu 
 soldier it was in the same billet that i overheard another priceless conversation the details of which have passed out 
 of my memory he and some other choice spirits were exchanging gleeful reminiscences of a vagabond existence in which they 
 dwelt on some of the more cheerful aspects of life in canadian jaus all the way from charlottetown to victoria 
 but there was nothing mean or sordid about dan certainly nothing criminal it was just his misfortune to be always 
 getting picked up as drunk and disorderly in his sober moments no one could have been more gentlemanly it was 
 a pleasure to see him address a girl in an estaminet with a deference that would have befitted a grand 
 lady and one could well believe the reports that when he was wounded he had been a prime favourite with 
 the nurses in hospital for in a world without alcohol his whole life would have been given up to little 
 acts of kindness what a time some of these old soldiers gave their nurses dand had been wounded early in 
 march and had recovered in a hospital in france the patients were allowed a couple of hours out when they 
 were convalescent dan and his friends there had discovered a back entrance by which they could steal back into the 
 hospital a couple of hours late in more or less moderate stages of intoxication dan was accustomed to save the 
 sister a climb on a chair by lifting his hand to turn on the lights but one night he had 
 come in worse for wear he felt around in the air but could find nothing when he took a chair 
 the sister said she coa d do that herself she only asked him because he was so tall i ll 
 have to get up on a chair tonight sister he said and just then down came dan with the chair 
 and the light the sister screamed and caught a whiff of his breath oh jock her name for all scotsmen 
 you ve been out for a walk dan felt very much ashamed of his fall from grace at the time 
 but memories of the nurses still made him smile what had brought dan into the war i never knew he 
 had come to the battalion in its first draft of reinforcements according to his own story the 12th battalion to 
 which he had belonged and which was converted into a reserve unit had received 0:re 0:ceived a call for reinforcemeits 
 and the colonel had siezed the opportunity to empty the clink and get rid at one stroke of all his 
 undesirables a really smart piece of work i never sought to lecture din on his habits but attacked him indirectly 
 by making him an intellectual companion for there was no smau fund of worldly wisdom to be gained in talking 
 over the problems of life with him he had samuel johnson s way of being able to speak with authority 
 on almost any subject he cared to discuss i found also that in these moments of quiet reflection he 
 164 seemed to abandon the broad scotch that he generally used and slip into a more cultural accent something after 
 the manner of lady chatterley s gamekeeper one night dan took a fancy to remain absolutely sober he walked down 
 to the village as he put it to see himself as others saw him he came back astounded 0:as 0:tounded 
 with the foolishness of men under the influence of liquor he had never realized before just what they were like 
 with a twinkle in his eye he expressed the opinion that the drink question called at once for he paused 
 a moment a royal commission but it was an experiment that he was not tempted to repeat i hope it 
 helped him to have these chats with a younger man who treated him seriously and not simply as a source 
 of amusement he must have been grateful for knowing that i wrote a good many letters he gave me all 
 his precious green envelopes for uncensored letters and would not hear of receiving anything in payment i saw him assume 
 authority to end what might have grown into a dangerous mutiny it was after lights out when a disturbance started 
 in the loft of our barn and the billet policeman placed the offender uader arrest when the latter re sisted 
 removal he called on sergeant major pritchard and between them they tried to get the man out peacefully but he 
 was kicking screaming and swearing and quickly roused the fighting spirit of his friends who leaped forward to effect a 
 rescue one wild little irishman lithe as a panther had taken three or four bounds over the sleeping forms and 
 jumpsd into the passageway where the struggle was going on dimly lit by the policeman s candle and paddy was 
 giving the sergeant major 0:ser 0:geant 0:major a piece of his mind in the traditional language of the british soldier 
 his eyes glistened in the dark like those of a mountain cat about to spring dan and a few others 
 followed and the sergeant major soon found himself surrounded by a howling swearing threatening circle of men just spoiling for 
 a fight i stood by curious to see how he would deal with the crisis and anxious for the men 
 involved who were friends of mine by this time whom i didn t like to see running into real trouble 
 it was dan who restored peace can t you arrest the man he asked contemptuously 0:con 0:temptuously here i ll 
 look after him and he ordered the disturber to bed the sergeant major thought it prudent to retire accompanied by 
 an outburst of damn you s and other grosser equivalents some though he had faued but he had handled a 
 ticklish situation in the best army manner preferring to ignore the flouting of his authority rather than provoke a serious 
 outbreak that might result in major penalties for all concerned next morning there were no charges of mutiny or insubordination 
 but a few arrests were made on the mild charge of disorderly conduct which resulted in seven days confinement to 
 billets and the incident was soon forgotten and not repeated shortly before christmas we moved up to the little villages 
 of la clytte and mllle kruysen and half of our company was lodged in ajaarn from which we sallied out 
 at night to work on the maintenance of thecaeadiani trenches about st eloi dan who was enjoying one of his 
 periodical spells of liberty again took his place to sleep beside me and i felt not a little pleased by 
 this silent tribute to his enjoyment of our conversations but they were soon to come to an end it was 
 the afternoon before christmas i had just received an air pillow of tartan design and was blowing it up dan 
 gazing at me in mock astonishment and asking are ye taking lessons on the bagpipes now some of the boys 
 were wondering if there would be time after the digging to walk back to la clytte for the midnight mass 
 the interest in things religious called forth the scoffs of one of the most assertive of the old soldiers of 
 the first draft a clydeside 0:clydes 0:ide workman who had no hesitation about declaring himself an atheist and going onto 
 a sweeping arraignment of churches priests and ministers it was all humbug to him both as a minister s son 
 and in support of christmas i felt obliged to take a moderating hand now mac i said you mustn t 
 be like the big boy who s found out all about it and starts telling the little kids there isn 
 t any santa claus 
 165 mind you i agree with a lot of what you say but on christmas eve even a man who 
 thinks for himself as we both do gets quite a thrill when he starts reading the old story and there 
 were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night i m not 
 denying it s a very pretty story said mac cautiously but for all that it s only a story it 
 s a story we ll all be thin king of tonight when we re out abiding in the field like 
 those old shepherds i answered and you ll be thinking about it too because you love a beautiful piece of 
 work i haven t watched you making regimental crests without seeing that mar was mollified by the compliment but youdon 
 tbelieve it s a true story he asked there s certainly a good deal of poetry and imagination about it 
 i said and it s perhaps 0:per 0:haps none the worse for that frankly mac i don t think jesus 
 would have wanted anyone to believe everything they said about him but if you get your new testament someday and 
 remenber that he was a carpenter and a workman like yourself you ll be surprised to find out how much 
 you agree with what he said you know they killed him because they thought he was a sort of revolutionist 
 and was upsetting the common people i don t know as he ever struck me that way before said mac 
 with a gleam of interest but i don t hold with the idea of his divinity well i wouldn t 
 worry too much about that myself after all he had a better idea when he taught the divinity of man 
 and saw us all as brothers and i think you d hold by that dan who had been an interested 
 listener interjected a man s a man for a that it was his one brief comment yes i said robert 
 burns was only saying the same thing in his own way you college fellows are too clever for the likes 
 of me said mac if we went on much longer you d be talking me into believing in god and 
 hell and all the rest of lt now mac i replied laughing you don t really believe that you know 
 you re just as clever as anyone of us and i woulda t have you believe in hell we catch 
 quite enough of lt here what i feel is none of us knows very much and we can t be 
 too sure of what s true and what isn t the world is just full of wonderful things that we 
 can t begin to understand and until we do i d sooner not kill all the fairy tales that help 
 to make life a little nicer for some of us i was surprised a few moments later when paddy shook 
 me warmly by the hand he who was in the clink as often as dan who drank so had that 
 he was very nearly in the d t s and at such times would see blood on his hands and 
 give a very fair imitation of lady macbeth but in a more violent manner i m glad you spoke up 
 he said with a note almost of fierceness that fellow with his nonsense pahl ye just got to have a 
 religion or ye re no man at all he was about the last man one would have expected to be 
 a supporter of religion when we came back for the evening tired enough to stay in the barn dan was 
 in one of his most gentle and reflective moods but by the morning the devil had got into both paddy 
 and din i had never seen them in such a mood of antisocial 0:anti 0:social revolt when the men were 
 called out for a distribution of the christmas presents that had reached the regiment for them the pair of them 
 stayed behind sulking and cursing the people who had sent them they were going to lose no time in getting 
 good and drunk and started off together in the most unamiable mood it was a unique christmas the noisiest i 
 ever spent i would say that at least one third of the men were drunk to the point of being 
 maudlin or stupid or shouting and it was raining off and on the whole day of course we overate the 
 daily mail s plum pudding was said to have been loaded with extra purgative ingredients 0:ingre 0:dients and it may 
 well have been true for it tore such a violent way through the consumers that it must have been designed 
 to counteract a whole month of chrlstms s parcels at the end of the day paddy and dan returned to 
 the drunken din their wild bellowings could be heard above the noise until they took themselves off for another trip 
 to the village several of the men were already sick and the straw 
 166 was foul with their spewing i was feeling far from well myself when peace came at last with lights 
 out and i sank into a troubled sleep at midnight i was suddenly awakened by the homecoming of the last 
 revellers dan lurched helplessly over me i got one of his boots in the eye and the other in the 
 stomach as the old fellow fell beside me in the straw and went to sleep without a word but for 
 me there was no more rest that night the shock had started the pudding on its irresistible course and i 
 spent the remainder of the night outside in the throes of combined indigestion and diarrhoea till lt seemed that death 
 would be a happy release from this utter misery but towards morning some thoughts of the season made me reflect 
 on the agony of the cross so patiently endured and what was my suffering in comparison to that i staggered 
 back to the barn to meet the dawn in lighter mood and to my relief fouid that i was mess 
 orderly for the day so that i would not have to face the long tramp through the muddy fields of 
 course dan and paddy had a terrific hangover and were still in a savage emper refusing to go out on 
 parade perhaps by this time they were scarcely responsible but at last there was nothing for it but to put 
 them under arrest when they appeared in the orderly room dan was given four weeks in the clinic and paddy 
 three and after all the disturbance they had ms de no one had any regrets for their temporary disappearance our 
 first turn of trench duty with the canadian corps began on the 9th of january we had marched a dozen 
 miles or so to dranoutre where we were in brigade reserve for the next three days generally after the weariness 
 of a tramp in full marching order the troops were allowed to rest for the evening but this time a 
 hundred men were required by the engineers for digging party and the duty fell to the lot of our company 
 there was much grumbling for we had been up since half past four the sorest man on parade was old 
 dan who did not see why he should be drawn from the clink to go digging and he refused point 
 blank to march at all till better counsel prevailed and he reluctantly took his place with the others we got 
 lost but finally contacted an engineer guide who took us to the scene of operations a field on a slope 
 a short distance behind our front line where the stray bullets wept or whistled or pinged sharply around us rousing 
 echoes in the woods beyond here we set to work in leisurely manner driving in posts and stakes we had 
 carried from a dump and bringing barbed wire from a nearby pile to construct an entanglement who was to be 
 entangled in this forlorn spot the soldiers wondered no one thought hat the british armies might some day give ground 
 if they did it would be in their way the surmise was that the engineers had to get rid of 
 the stuff somewhere occasionally we stopped to note a close call as the area seemed to be swept by rifle 
 fire no doubt attracted by the unavoidable noise it wis shortly after ten when dan mclean got a bullet in 
 the abdomen one of the men dressed the wound and the stretcher bearers tried to make him comfortable but the 
 bullet had lodged instead of going right through and he was undergoing torture everyone 0:every 0:one stopped work now in 
 silent sympathy for poor dan was one of the best loved men in the regiment for all his wild ways 
 the engineer guide was nowhere to be found no one could retrace with any confidence the uncertain way through the 
 fields or had the faintest idea of the location of the nearest dressing station and meanwhile a loved life was 
 ebbing away percy molson who was in charge of the party the most considerate anc gentle of officers was distracted 
 almost to agony by the situation it wis his first visit to the line it took a full hour to 
 find the road from which we had walked in a quarter of the time the gentlest of bearers could not 
 have carried the wounded man smoothly over the rough and broken ground and he was shivering with cold as he 
 lay motionless on the stretcher he knew he was dying said good bye to the boys who had gathered around 
 him and prayed to be left alone on the grouid with a drink of brandy but there was nothing available 
 when the dressing station 
 167 was finally reached it was evident that medical assistance could have done nothing for him the bullet had hit 
 too many vital organs he lingered on till five when his troubled life was over at last daniel mclean had 
 endured the shelling at ypres and done his full duty in the trenches in those early may days when the 
 regiment had faced annihilation only to perish on a fatigue party that had done no useful work and that should 
 never have been ordered i attended the brief funeral service and saw my old friend laid away in a blanket 
 the bottle bearing his name laid at his feet for all his noise and drunkeness he regiment would be poorer 
 for the loss of his bruliant wit and his steadfast sense of duty in the line when he was safe 
 from the temptations of life but one could not linger over such incidents death was commonplace in those days the 
 best of men would be mowed down and the war must go on as if nothing had happened whenever i 
 hear of monuments raised to the memory of the unkown soldier my thoughts go back to daniel mclean as one 
 best fitted to serve in that symbolic 0:sym 0:bolic role both by his capacity and his humanity as well as 
 by the glamour and mystery that clung to him wliile his real self remains forever unkown buying selling hn posted

 to say that while they are not yet in a position to submit a final report the special committee set 
 up at our last meeting to look more deeply into the bastedo situation has been making progress with the aid 
 of the assistant judge advocate general who is quietly and tactfully gathering pertinent information and studying the legal aspects of 
 the problem the trustees of the hamilton gault memorial fund have agreed to continue support of the three affiliated cadet 
 corps as weu as to provide modest assistance 0:assis 0:tance to any of the top cadets who may be selected

 178 edmonton branch this branch has managed to maintain a reasonable strength for 1972 and it is the intention of 
 the executive to increase this membership this may possibly have been achieved by the time this journal is distributed the 
 main problem facing the branch and undoubtedly shared by others is the need for more active participation in the business 
 matters of the branch by more members it goes without elaboration that finances are always an ever growing problem these 
 problems have been the main items on the agendas 0:a 0:gendas of recent executive meetings with no immediate solution arrived 
 at the main activity for 1972 was a dinner dance on the 17th of march to mark the birthday of 
 our colonel in chief we were joined on this occasion by many of the patricia officers and their wives who 
 serve in the vicinity of edmonton out of town guests included capt and mrs dit roe wainwright mr and mrs

 lieutenant governor of alberta dr j w mcewan led the wreath laying ceremony at the cenotaph jim o neill recently 
 retired from the regiment laid the wreath on behalf of the association the main event for 1973 will be the 
 26th annual general meeting and reunion 0:re 0:union of the association to be held hare in edmonton on the weekend 
 of the 15th and 16th of september the preparation and the hosting of this weekend is being shared jointly with 
 tne loyal edmonton regiment 4 ppcli and their regimental association the fortyniners the details of this weekend will have already 
 been made known to all concerned for anyone else who would care to attend it is suggested that they contact 
 the regimental adjutant as soon as possible because the executive of 1972 were the proponents of this reunion and related 
 meetings being held in the oil city it was decided that for continuity purposes they remain in office for a 
 further tour of one year consequently the executive is the same as that which was reported in last year s 
 journal there have been a number of patricia visitors during the past year notably jim and melba coutts enroute to 
 retirement jim is in fine form and has not lost his touch with the pipes also alex and dinah sim

 highlight of the year was the ceremony of trooping the colour performed by the second battalion during the same weekend

 harry cotton secretary treasurer kerry dunphy serving personnel liaison lieutenant colonel c b snider montreal branch montreal keeps marching on 
 but in common with other branches we don t have the numerical strength or elan of former years marooned in 
 the effete east we have always drawn our principal support from world war l veterans god bless them we would 
 have perished without them the interested participation 0:partici 0:pation of world war ii and korean veterans has been harder to 
 enlist because of their business and family comirfi tments and the montreal area does not seem to attract retired members 
 of a regular regiment stationed in the west therefore our organized gatherings during the past year were reduced to one 
 a very enjoyable cocktail party at the mcgill faculty club on march 29th thirty comrades and their ladles were there 
 it was good to see familiar faces again we only wish it had been possible to welcome newcomers to the 
 area such as major paul hunter and captain r j cohen who have recently been posted to cfb st hubert 
 but they were otherwise engaged it will be a pleasure to see them soon among oat of towners were reg 
 jones and his wife formerly of st john n 8 and now of cornwall ontario and archie mackinnon from dedham 
 mass and three friends including hector macneil formerly of cape breton and the 85th bn and now resident in mass 
 it was very good of them to make the long trip and we appreciated having them with their delightful ladies 
 as always we send warmest greetings to all old comrades and ask them to get in touch with us if 
 they arrive in canada s metropolis toronto take note thankfully we have no deaths to report this year honorary president

 meeting and annual luncheon as usual at the victory club in london on the bth of may 1972 it was 
 a smaller gathering than usual many members were unable to attend owing to age and other disability joe neller art 
 milne and p f young were some of the regulars who were unable to attend we were however able to 
 welcome two visitors mr mrs marshall from ottawa also during the past year some of our members have had the 
 pleasure of meeting others who were here on visits from canada in may we lost one of our older members 
 p f young m original of the edmonton regiment who died in hospital after a short illness at the end 
 of september we were shocked to learn that the widow of the founder of the regiment mrs a hamilton gault 
 had passed away this wonderful lady who took such an active interest in so many things in addition to the 
 regiment will long be remembered by all who have had the privilege of knowing her no words of ours are 
 adequate to pay tribute to this most kind and gracious lady in october we were again saddened to learn of 
 the death of admiral the honourable sir alexander ramsay beloved husband of lady patricia our colonel in chief the admiral 
 retired after a long and distinguished career in the navy took a keen interest in the work of the royal 
 british legion near his home at windlesham many legion members were present at the memorial service at the church of
