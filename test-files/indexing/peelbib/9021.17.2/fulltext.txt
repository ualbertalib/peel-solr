 the rockies were primitive with little trace of human habitation no rut scored the sod no furrow scarred the long
 roll of the prairie they were as thousands of years of geological and climatic processes had made them man had
 hardly touched them for man himself was primitive in that he had adapted himself to nature and not nature to
 himself the grasses flowed the prairie fires ran in the wind the buffaloes grazed in scattered formations the buffalo hunt

 the possibility of new beginnings ture that is the bloom of civilization an election story a good story is told
 of chief justice sifton of alberta who was once a famous stump speaker this story explains why he was accounted
 such a marvelous orator his memory was a miracle on one occasion he and dr brett were having a campaign
 in the banff district the two candidates were friends as well as competitors and were holding joint mee ings it
 had been so arranged between them that on one evening dr brett would speak first and mr sifton would reply
 then on the following evening the order of things would be reversed and mr sifton would speak first and dr
 brett reply and so it was that on one occasion when it was mr sifton s turn to take the
 platform first he finished his discourse before the doctor had arrived an emergency call having delayed the representative of the
 medical profession in order to keep the meeting going mr sifton arose and assured the assembled audience that he had
 heard dr brett s address on several occasions and that if they would allow him he would tell them exactly
 what the doctor would say if he were here the audience yelled assent so mr sifton proceeded to give dr
 brett s speech word for word as he had heard it on several occasions he told all the doctor s
 stories and told them well when he was nearly through dr brett arrived in great haste and mr sifton at
 once sat down the doctor ascended the platform and began to deliver his address the smiles that spread over the
 faces of the audience who had gathered that night at the little town of anthracite may be easily imagined but
 it was some time before dr brett could discover what had gone wrong with his audience banif crag canyon j

 we acquired a miniature on ivory of henry mackenzie brother of roderick and cousin of sir alexander mackenzie believed to
 be the only ‘ picture of him extant this was in possession of one of his descendants whom we located
 in guelph ontario henry mackenzie was best known as the public relations man for the north west company and during
 the troubles the north west company had with lord selkirk he wrote many articles in the montreal gazette and other
 papers telling the north west co story we acquired in 1965 a nor wester journal covering the winter s operations
 for 1818 1819 of a post on lake winnipeg this came to light in california and emphasizes the value of
 keeping this miniature on ivory is the only known cross reference notes on fur trade fami picture of henry mackenzie
 a nor wester and lies who were extensively inter related cousin of the famous explorer sir alexander through marriage in
 this case i was mackenzie talking to a book dealer who mentioned a collection of fur trade documents early nineteenth
 century and late eightwhich he bought in 1938 the man who teenth century letters included were sold these documents had
 walked into several by john macdonald of garth his shop in montreal made a deal for who founded rocky mountain
 house the documents and was supposed to my next move will be to see descendants come back for the balance
 of his money of his son judge roland macdonald he was also to take the dealer to his who are
 supposed to have more papers home to show him several trunks full of which have never been made available the
 same sort of material the man to historians never came back the dealer told me while on a trip to
 the west i acquired this story and gave me the man s name simon fraser s silver snuff mull in
 calwhich was lamothe i have a sister in gary it will go to the north west law whose name was
 lamothe and by company museum in williamstown talking to her family and various other glengarry county which is under the
 relatives i eventually got to a trust auspices of the glengarry historical company that handled the estate of the society
 this is a prime relic of the man who had sold documents to the nor westers and was in possession
 of dealer in 1938 the journal got to cciii a woman who was a macdonell and fornia as a gift
 from lamothe but the whose great great grandfather brought bulk of this collection had been given simon fraser s mother
 and family to to another person in california at the glengarry from the mowhawk valley at time of mr lamothe
 s death in 1959 the time of the american revolution unfortunately the woman who received many years later he gave
 this relic to this material destroyed it about two the mcdonell family months before i got in touch with her
 currently we are working on leads over the past three years we have regarding the missing fraser journals been acquiring
 the papers of the vicar they were sent from victoria in 1906 to general of a catholic diocese who had
 relatives near hamilton where they discarefully preserved several thousand appeared within the last year we have 14 had several leads
 that may possibly his brother john this happened through result in the finding of these valuable meeting a woman while
 looking at his journals old house which is at point fortune in my last file regarding nor westers ontario on
 the ottawa river she put the locating of documents and tracking me in touch with a descendant in otdown their
 descendants has to do with tawa and through her i found out about john lepretre macdoneil john was another relation
 in virginia there i given this name the priest as ap got over two hundred letters going back parently he
 made the voyageurs say to 1773 all written by john lepretre their prayers every morning whether macdonell they wanted to
 or not the name also helped distinguish him from all the there are more nwco documents other macdonells in the
 north west that can be recovered new leads are company we got onto the track of constantly being followed up
 and the some papers of his brother miles who material recovered is available in the was lord selkirk s agent
 and earlier ontario archives canada s first nwco was in the royal canadian volunteers museum also has opened to the
 public one of canada s first militia regiments at williamstown 15 miles east of corn we acquired an 1801 diary
 of his and wall ontario where it tells much of later learned of some other papers of the story of
 early western history what in thunder perhaps the most severe electrical storm in calgary s history passed over the town
 on monday afternoon striking buildings frightening women and childrenaye and men too ringing telephones and taking a mad frolic generally
 but luckily without doing much damage it appeared as if two storms one down the valley of the bow and
 the other down the elbow valley proceeded against calgary at about the same time each one growling and threatening while
 the chains of lightning threw out angry forks at each other as if bent on blood some telephone poles were
 broken down and it is said mr brigg s chimney was struck and his stove smashed at dr rouleau s
 house the electric wire was cut off and the paper on the wall browned and the room filled with smoke
 a domestic received a shock and was partially paralyzed for a time but without injury the fire escape on the
 west side of the alberta caught the firey element and mr garrett mail clerk who was near an adjacent window
 felt the shock quite plainly while an electric lamp in the barbershop in the basement was burst but perhaps there
 was more consternation at the fire hail than any place in town the current struck the flag staff and shattered
 it and passed down the tower into the front of the building thence along a covered stringer to the horse
 stalls where it again came to light jumped the hallway into the office dropped about five feet and cut a
 nice clean bullet hole through the partition into the driver s bedroom where further trace of the eccentric wanderer could
 not be found the whole building was filled with smoke and the horses seemed almost paralyzed with fear while some
 of the men throught they were sent for but not to go to the ordinary calgary flare up these heavy
 claps seemed to come just as the two storms apparently met near the confluence of the streams and the great
 wonder is that there was no loss of life as well as a greater damage to property calgary herald august

 of the greatest determinants which has shaped the history of canada has been its geography most textbooks in their opening
 chapters lay some stress on the five major geographical areas of canada and since most of these texts are written
 by eastern historians british columbia is inevitably last on the list and is usually described somewhat vaguely as a sea
 of mountains if one examined the index to these texts looking for references to people and events which loom large
 in british columbia one may ii n d the briefest mention of captain george vancouver james douglas the boundary dispute
 of 1846 or the gold rush of 1858 if they are mentioned they are usually given the briefest treatment as
 something which occurred far away at the other end of the continent and certainly beyond the range of interest of
 those happy easterners who seem to think that the wilderness starts where yonge street ends now in case you get
 the idea that i oregon coast in 1603 but for almost 150 am a typical british columbian taking a years

 so inaccessible to pacific as a spanish lake a rather european explorers as british columbia large one even for her
