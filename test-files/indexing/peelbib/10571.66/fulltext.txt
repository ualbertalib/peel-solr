 2 the patrician 2003 vp colonel in chief princess patricia s canadian light infantry message from the colonel in chief 
 the countess mountbatten of burma cbe cd jp dl it is with great pleasure that i once again write some 
 remarks for the patrician since its inception this publication has provided a tremendous means of showcasing the many activities that 
 our patricias are involved in in reviewing the year s events i was once again amazed at how much was 
 accomplished this year by the officers and soldiers of my regiment there were of course the two tours in bosnia 
 by the first and second battalions i had the good fortune along with my son timothy and general de chastelain 
 of visiting the first battalion in march just prior to its redeployment home despite the weather which challenged the logistical 
 aspects of our trip it was a splendid visit and i was tremendously proud of the work being performed by 
 my patricias in this war torn area the highlight of this past year was for me of course my visit 
 to edmonton in june and to be able to preside at the very important regimental occasion of the change of 
 appointment ceremony of the colonels of the regiment it was very sad indeed to bid farewell to general de chastelain 
 who had managed some how at the same time to regularly 0:regu 0:larly and frequently cross the atlantic for his 
 duties overseeing the de commissioning of arms in ireland i was also very pleased to welcome another old friend major 
 general stewart as our new colonel of our regiment both officers are men of great distinction and the regiment is 
 very well served by them both i also had the pleasure of bestowing honorary patricia status on the lieutenant governor 
 of alberta lois hole and on colonel francis weircinski commander task force rakassan op apollo 101 st airborne us army 
 for their outstanding support to the regiment our regimental family is enriched by their addition as in past years 2003 
 was a year of high and low points i was saddened by the news of the death of bgen stuart 
 graham who was a very proud soldier who led a full life and served his regiment very well especially as 
 the colonel of the regiment from october 1987 to october 1990 i was also saddened to hear of the death 
 of cpl jamie vermeulen a dedicated enthusiastic 2nd battalion soldier who enjoyed life and served his regiment loyally since 1986 
 i was heartened by the formal recognition of the accomplishments of many regimental personages through the awarding of various medals 
 and awards while extremely proud of the awards earned by soldiers in operations i was especially pleased by the awarding 
 of the meritorious service medal civil to rod middleton for his unwavering 0:unwaver 0:ing and dedicated support of the regimental 
 museum and the regiment s heritage the presentation of the commander in chiefs unit commendation to the third battalion capped 
 off an extraordinary year of recognition for the soldiers and the regiment whether on operations in bosnia fighting fires in 
 british columbia or working tirelessly in the association or at the museum my patricias continue to do great things i 
 am proud of you all 
 vp colonel of the regiment princess patricia s canadian light infantry message from the colonel of the regiment major general 
 ret d r i stewart cmm cd since my appointment as colonel of the regiment in june 2003 i have 
 been extremely impressed by the accomplishments 0:accom 0:plishments of the regiment while this has always been the case my appointment 
 has provided an opportunity to see the current serving soldiers and officers up close and personal i have stood on 
 parade with them watched as they were awarded 0:award 0:ed individually and en masse patrolled on operations with them and 
 soldiered with them in the field i can say categorically that i have liked what i ve seen today s 
 soldiers are as tough robust proud and skilled in the field as any that i have seen in my forty 
 years of soldiering in a word they are professional my first six months as colonel of the regiment have been 
 remarkable i had the pleasure of attending the change of command parades of the first battalion and the loyal edmonton 
 regiment during the summer as well the badging ceremony in gagetown for our new subbies i visited the second battalion 
 in bosnia where i found the area of operations secure and in good hands and followed this with a visit 
 to the western area training centre where i had the opportunity to see our new soldiers under going training and 
 to present them with their patricia badges in december i watched proudly as the third battalion was duly recognized for 
 its outstanding tour of duty in afghanistan throughout the year many deserving individual and units have received awards and are 
 an example of the high calibre of our soldiers well done to all recipients lam extremely proud to have been 
 appointed the colonel of the regiment the appointment allows me to continue to serve the regimental family and to continue 
 to serve with soldiers i look forward to my tour of duty and to serving with soldiers for the next 
 two and half years i am sure i will continue to be impressed all the best for good soldiering 3

 4 the patrician 2003 rhq vp editor s comments message from the regimental major major e a giraldeau cd i 
 enjoy editing the production of the patrician i enjoy it because i get to read and sometimes correct the articles 
 that are submitted from across the regiment i am always amazed at the wide range of activities that members of 
 the regiment are involved in the regular force battalions always seem to be very busy the tempo of operations 0:oper 
 0:ations and training is nothing short of hectic the troops seem to be constantly engaged in either challenging and exciting 
 training exercises or on operations be they domestic ops like fire fighting or international ops in bosnia and elsewhere the 
 troops are busy and there is not much down time between activities but i m sure they would rather be 
 busy than bored the loyal eddie soldiers are relatively speaking busy as well i continue to be impressed by the 
 dedication of the citizen soldiers who balance civilian careers and schooling with their military service i also enjoy reading about 
 the exploits of our regimentally affiliated cadet corps these young men and women future patricias clearly enjoy themselves within the 
 military environment their enthusiasm and eagerness is inspiring and presents a good reminder of why many of us joined the 
 army in the first place finally i enjoy reading about and seeing the pictures of the various gatherings of our 
 retired members the bonds of friendship and regimental spirit that have endured over years of service and beyond is heartening 
 it is good to see living exam pies of the saying once a patricia always a patricia 
 the patrician 2003 5 rhq vp there is something special about the ties that link all members of the regiment 
 from the army cadets to the reserve and regular force soldiers through to the old guard patricias from across the 
 spectrum of the regiment contribute in their own way to strengthening the fabric of the regiment it is hoped that 
 the patrician can be a reflection of the many aspects of this fine regimental family congratulations princess patricia s canadian 
 light infantry on your anniversary in june 2004 you stand by to protect our home front from the nature of

 given time but we at least had a quorum on a few occasions in 2003 regimental events in the area 
 this year included a well attended informal gathering in august observances with the regimental association at lansdowne park on november 
 11th and a final gathering to meet the cos and rsms later in novembe the get together with the cos 
 and rsms was the probably best attended and longest lasting local event of the year another event worth noting was 
 the long overdue dedication 0:dedi 0:cation of a national korean war memorial on 27 september hundreds of korean veterans attended 
 a reunion weekend in ottawa which culminated in the dedication o 1 a national memorial to the fallen of that 
 conflict an enthusiastic old guard of patricia fell in behind the camp flag as part of a march past of

 86 the patrician 2003 vp cfrc vancouver the patricia s have again left their mark on cfrc although most of

 kind of year in recruiting patricias continue to hold some key positions in vancouver the new co maj ralf urzinger

 patricias were not overly impacted by the move in the words of sgt muehlbereger at least this ain t dundurn 
 the annual rotp campaign was launched along with various school visits and numerous career fairs the bread and butter cycle 
 of recruiting had just begun the official grand opening of the new and improved cfrc vancovuer punctuated this sea son

 maj waddell and welcomed our new co maj ralf urzinger it was the first change of command that didn t 
 require a march past or hours of rehearsals this was a difficult adjustment for sgt mullick who was still assimilating 
 through the culture shock having just been posted into the centre in april of 2002 even though the posting is 
 perceived as a jammy go any one who has spent time in recruiting knows that this is not always the 
 case recruiting has it s own unique set of challenges one such challenge was taken up by sgt mullick who 
 was tasked to make in roads into the lower mainland s large south asian community he is happy to eport 
 that the mission has been successful to date and he now finds himself pictured an various outreach displays magazines and 
 other local media the new challenge for ecruiting s poster boy secure an agent on a beautiful sunny west coast

 0:cen 0:trepiece of middle east conflicts this tract of land has served as a land bridge to africa a barrier 
 to conquest and a place of sanctuary from the wars of europe the peninsula itself has changed ownership numerous times 
 over the years most recently in april 1982 following the end of the 4th arab israeli war the peninsula was 
 returned to egypt with the multinational force and observers mfo established to oversee the treaty of peace between egypt and 
 israel currently the possibility of war between egypt and israel is remote nevertheless the focus of the mission has remained 
 constant now for over twenty years to observe and report what the mfo observes and reports on is incursions into 
 designated buffer zones between the countries by egyptian or israeli forces while this rarely occurs due to hostile intent directed 
 at each other it has been israel s internal 0:inter 0:nal strife with the palestinians that has had the greatest 
 impact this is because whenever 0:when 0:ever the israelis conduct raids into the gaza strip for internal security operations they 
 are actually in violation of the treaty if they operate within three kilometres of the egypt israeli border in light 
 of the palestinian intefada that started in 2000 this has been a frequent occurrence pushing the operational tempo within the 
 mfo to an alltime 0:all 0:time high currently 29 personnel comprise the canadian contingent of the mfo unique to the

 thursday and sport shooting on saturdays the manitoba north west ontario association branch takes sponsorship of the 2701 cadet corps 
 the first exercise of the year was enjoyed very much by all even though it was conducted on the base 
 due to extremely bad weather the training that cadets participated 0:partici 0:pated in was setting up a ten man tent 
 snow shoeing knots and lashings and packing a sled even thought the temperatures were cold and we slept in the 
 drill hall the morale was up and the cadets had fun throughout the training year the competitive rifle team attended 
 multiple rifle competitions and placed fairly well the rifle team trained every saturday afternoon and put in many hours of 
 hard work inside and outside of cadet time this year the rifle team continues to practice and hopes to place 
 better than last year along with a rifle team the cadet corps had a biathlon team last year which ran 
 and shot on saturday mornings and went to skiing practices on sundays

 patricia association has been extremely supportive to our corps and we look forward to many successful years in may we 
 headed off to richer manitoba on what we thought was going to be our final exercise of the year we 
 believe that the richer exercise was the best of them all it was enjoyed by all especially the seniors who 
 had a ball of their own the training 0:train 0:ing was different which was welcomed by all at one point 
 in the exercise the section commanders had to go across a creek on a rope bridge built by their cadets 
 to say mantario trail september 2003 the least in most attempts it ended with the section commander getting a little 
 wet the other activities consisted of patrolling as well as shelter construction in the evening we had a bonfire followed 
 by some good old camp stories during the last week of may the cadets had their annual inspection where the 
 cadets had the chance to show off all of the skills that they had learned over the training 0:train 0:ing 
 year to family and friends the day began early in the morning where the cadets had the chance to prepare 
 for the parade to come in the evening after friends and family arrived the parade began with the march on 
 followed by an inspection by major patrick oc rear party 2vp afterwards the cadets displayed their annual projects to family 
 and friends these projects outlined the training year finally medals and awards were presented to those cadets who stood out 
 from the rest as the day concluded all the cadets were relieved that all of their hard work that they 
 had done over the year paid off on the first weekend in june eight members of the cadet corps competed 
 in an eco challenge in shilo manitoba they found this both physically and mentally exhausting one of our two teams 
 placed second out of eighteen later in the month of june our cadet corps joined up with the tommy prince

 the last year was indeed a hectic year with some wonderful accomplishments across the association we see branches addressing their 
 local issues head on others are still struggling to find their place as their demographic situation changes it was also 
 a year of unprecedented losses no one can dispute the inevitability of such things but the past year has seen 
 the passing of so many stalwart and well beloved members we will miss their support that some have given the 
 association for over 40 years they will be remembered with deep affection by us all one element of successfully sustaining 
 an organization whether it is a branch of the association or the association itself is being aware that change is 
 occurring it takes place continually and we must be prepared to deal with it sometimes a change is small and 
 gradual with little impact on us or our branches at other times change can be major with far reaching effects 
 we have to understand the changes that are occurring to enable us and our association to successfully meet the challenges 
 of change our focus remains with our membership notwithstanding our current membership 0:member 0:ship level of 862 the number could 
 be much higher far too few of retiring patricias see the necessity of joining the association regrettably also far too 
 many serving patricias fail to see the significance of joining the association some don t even know we exist we 
 in the association always believed that our regimental family is composed of retired and serving patricias yes there are by 
 practice differences in our governance 0:gover 0:nance but we still are patricias the association is not an old boys club 
 far from it the association has provided in the past and will continue to do so an invaluable service to 
 the regiment as a whole an association provides people with an opportunity to be involved directly in something they like 
 your association provides a forum for discussion 0:discus 0:sion on regimental matters there is no doubt that the public image 
 of the regiment has been improved as a result of association activity therefore the challenge is yours serving or just 
 retired to join us and thus strengthen our regimental family

 our next agm in cornwallis n s 17 19 september 2004 ottawa branch 2003 was a rather quiet year for 
 the ottawa branch with only two meetings taking 0:tak 0:ing place the annual general meeting was held on the bth 
 of may at which the current 0:cur 0:rent executive was returned by acclamation the annual remembrance day service again was 
 held at lansdowne park with over 125 retired serving family and friends attending this year we had the added benefit 
 of having a choral group in attendance thanks to the efforts of bill love the aged in harmony led us 
 in singing and at the end of the service entertained the members with a medley of world war one songs 
 on 28 september 2003 the korean war memorial was unveiled and dedicated in confederation park in ottawa don reiben and 
 pat dillon of the ottawa branch provided 0:pro 0:vided yeoman service to the committee to ensure that it went off 
 without a hitch over 1000 korean war veterans attended with the patricia contingent being the largest well done

 sunshine coast to dell and kent foster and yvette and lou barbeau go our best wishes and good golfing 
 110 the patrician 2003 south west ontario branch the year 2003 was a good year for our branch as we 
 were privileged to host the association annual general meeting in st catharines it was a great success we were no 
 doubt aided in part by the geographical location but the main reason for its success was because so many people 
 from other branches and members at large must have contacted others and decided to attend there were folks here from 
 the atlantic to the pacific and all places in between resulting in the largest attendance at an agm for many 
 years besides having people in attendance from so many locations two other highlights stand out in this writer s mind 
 firstly the presence of so many serving patricias from the senior patricia b gen nordick though to cpl furlong from 
 3 ppcli who stole the show after the formal meeting with his presentation and secondly 0:sec 0:ondly the presence of 
 helen sutherland this was quite significant to our branch as it was her late husband suds sutherland who as colonel 
 of the regiment had presented the charter to our branch some 16 years prior in waterdown prior to the agm 
 we had held a regimental day brunch in march at which 40 people enjoyed some comraderie we gained a few 
 new younger members last year and it is hoped they will bring in more to keep the branch strong last 
 fall a number of our korean vets members journeyed to ottawa for the unveiling ceremony of the korean war monument 
 this coming summer the south west ontario branch will be the good lord willing have a contingent at the 90th 
 anniversary celebrations agm in edmonton where they look forward to relaxing and enjoying western hospitality manitoba north west ontario branch

 bob cumming gerry hawkins nick oshanski and stu weeks were all re elected our march 16 ladies day in the 
 second battalion wos sgts mess was disappointing in one respect only five ladies attended and none of our widows were 
 able to make it however the guys enjoyed themselves most of second battalion s troops were in bosnia on kapyong 
 day so the rear party and man nw ont branch held a brief ceremony at the kapyong monument in front

 111 the patrician 2003 our casino and barbecue on may 31 was a blast although not intended as a fund 
 raiser we did make a few bucks on it most players who had any casino money left after the games 
 fortune teller and horse races spent it on the silent auction so we didn t have much of a line 
 up of players cashing in when it was all over the husband and wife team of paul and gillian ryan

 gerry franc earned the alf rooke trophy for association members low gross and kevin schur was awarded the l a 
 len quinlan trophy for association members low net our annual dinner on october 18 attracted the largest group we have 
 had in recent years perhaps it was because members were aware that this was to be our last in the 
 2 ppcli wos sgts mess we were especially pleased to see from the world war two era fred and jean 
 snell syd mckay and gladys kuzyk following an excellent dinner major steve carr and csm tim powers from second battalion

 our members our 27th annual anniversary dinner was held in penticton bc on the 29th of may 2003 and as 
 all past dinners it can only be described as magnificent followed by great entertainment by linda jones company despite last
