 notes since last we went to press there has taken place a great and memorable event in the history of 
 the regiment on the 14th of april at minto street armouries winnipeg his excellency the right honorable the earl of 
 bessborough governor general of canada presented new colours to the regiment this is not an ordinary occurrence in the life 
 of a regiment indeed it does not usually occur in the same unit once in a century the colour that 
 our men followed in france and flanders the only colour taken into action by any british unit in the great 
 war the colour that has been ours since the war both are now furled and put away and in their 
 place fly the new colours presented to us by his excellency the governor general on april 14th it is regrettable 
 that more members of esquimalt station could not go to winnipeg for the presentation and consecration of the new colours 
 but all ranks are very glad that major w g colquhoun m c officer commanding the station was able to 
 be present and take part in the ceremony the events of that day are described in detail elsewhere in this 
 issue spring has arrived at esquimalt and with it have come the daffodils the tulips the roses and spring training 
 at the moment all thoughts are directed on the preliminaries to the coming summer this month a training camp for 
 n p a m units will be held at vernon 8 c and many of our personnel are already deep 
 in plans and preparations s e the shootists are also active and have begun what they confidently expect will be 
 a bumper season on the ranges sports training is well under way it is the season of preparation 0:prepar 0:ation 
 and we hope tho summer will fulfill all its inspiring promises this issue of the patrician marks the end of 
 volume 1 if you have any suggestions that might improve our publication please forward them as soon as possible to 
 the editors wo hope to come out with a volume 2 that will be bigger and better than ever let

 m c and in turn presented to 2 lieut h e cotton immediately following this ceremony his excellency briefly addressed 
 the regiment in point of time yours is a young regiment his excellency said but your old colours bear eloquent 
 testimony to the quality of the service it has given to king and country on the new colours which i 
 have handed you today these same scars are perpetuated in the emblazoned list of your battle honours in them is 
 consecrated and renewed the spirit which fired the regiment on its first formation in them also is enshrined for all 
 time the memory of your gallant dead who marched and fought behind the old colour but did not return with 
 them to canada that spirit that memory will i trust remain with you always though as all of us must 
 hope your new colours may never be subjected to the terrible blast of war though fresh names may not be 
 added to the glamour roll of their battle honours yet when the time comes for them to bo replaced you 
 and those who come after you will see to it i know that the tradition of tho regiment will still 
 stand as high then as it does today and so i hand them to you in the full confidence that 
 the regiment will hold them in safe keeping and will never forget the message that they embody the guards reformed 
 lino a general salute was given tho colours and they were marched to their place in the line the guards 
 then marched past his excellency with the colours eollowing this the battalion advanced in review order and a royal salute 
 was given this signalled the end of the ceremony the colours wore marched off parade the officers fell out the 
 guards were marched away and the groat event was over or nearly so the east end of the armouries was 
 transformed into a regimental mess and there the guests of the regiment were entertained after the presentation simultaneously the sergeants 
 mess entertained at the west end of the armouries that evening a dinner was held at tho eort garry hotel 
 following which tho officers and their guests attended a dance in the hotel it was very gratifying to sec major

 advantages of regular exercise incidentally our professor of physical culture never seems to run out of new gomes for us 
 to play in our easier moments the signallers have been busy for the last month filling the air with their 
 eddy umpty and muttering in their sleep about such utterly abstruse things as condensers volts usually confused with amperes duplex 
 mirrors oblique strokes and on may bth and 9th they will take their annual classification and so far they all 
 seem to look cheerful and confident as is usual the star turn at this season of the year is snail

 twice a week also the miniature range and 30 yards range have been busy and the results seem to be 
 well up to standard we are hoping soon to go out to real s where we pot at the bull

 now reposes peacefully in valises ready for transportation to other seats or centres of learning and the m b s

 119 band notes 3 c 3f the regimental band continues to be very aotive with numerous engagements at public functions 
 the season s educational programmes given to winnipeg schools are finished until next y inter recently the band had the 
 honour of pla3 ing to sir arthur balfe head of the balfe steel works sheffield england sir arthur in a 
 letter to captain t w james director of music expressed his pleasure at hearing this well known canadian band and 
 considered the work they were doing of empire importance in so far as educating musically the young people of canada 
 was concerned an interesting incident occurred on the occasion of the presentation of the colours when captain c e colville 
 a d c to his excellency the governor general recognised bandsman t smith as one who had served under him 
 in malta and india incidentally he was bandsman smith s company commander for several years in the gordon highlanders lady

 the marker five bucks for that shot now that s what i call sense there were none could place this

 121 on trooping the colour by cpl l c morrison note the writer is indebted to q m s i 
 k e mcculloch for much kind assistance in the preparation of this article incredible as it may appear no one 
 has yet satisfactorily discovered the origin of the ceremony of trooping the colour regarding the existence of flags we gather 
 that these emblems were used by the early children of israel if we turn to the second chapter of numbers 
 second verse we read every man of the children of israel shall pitch by his own standard with the ensign 
 of their father s house far off about the tabernacle shall they pitch so here at least we have every 
 evidence of the use of special emblems to indicate the various armies joshua was considered an exceptionally brilliant general and 
 may have created the precedent of using flags regarding the trooping ceremony this has been used at guard mounting parades 
 in the british army for the last century we cannot trace its origin but it is known to have been 
 in existence in some form in the early eighteenth or even seventeenth 0:seven 0:teenth century the colours of a regiment 
 are two in number one the king s colour which is the symbol of the crown to which the soldier 
 has sworn allegiance and which is only trooped in the case of a guard mounted for his majesty the king 
 her majesty the queen members of the royal family or his majesty s chief representative in british possessions or mandated 
 territories and the other the regimental colour representing the spirit and traditions of the regiment which form the basis of 
 esprit dc corps the guards are first formed up without their officers in order to prove they can be trusted 
 later the officers take post and tho band pays its respects by marching across tho parade ground first in slow 
 time then in quick time from medieval times comes one of the most interesting parts of the ceremony the taking 
 over of the colour when tho standard was the rallying point of the army it was entrusted to a specially 
 selected officer with much display by the men atarms 0:men 0:at 0:arms the right of the line was considered the 
 post of honour by the roman legionaries who wore their shields on their left arms 
 122 their right being exposed naturally only the bravest and best were selected for this position in the british army 
 the grenadier company of guards was normally placed in this position and in trooping the colour formed the escort under 
 the lieutenant of the guard who takes over the responsibility which youth is supposed to assume the escort moves across 
 tho parade and halts facing the colour the regimental sergeant major as the representative of the warrant officers non commissioned 
 officers and men takes the colour from the sergeant in charge and hands it ovor to the officer who is 
 to carry the colour it is then received with full honours the command present arms is given and the band 
 plays a salute this is the only time the regimental sergeant major salutes with his sword when the escort presents 
 arms the sergeants on tho outer flanks turn outwards nd bring their rifles to the port in ancient days sergeants 
 were armed with a halberd or short pike with a cutting blade the fort is the first movement of pike 
 drill for coming down from the shoulder for attack or defence in this ceremony the escort are presenting arms in 
 salute the significance of this being an offering of the weapon to a friend or stranger as an indication of 
 trust consequently while the escort is technically defenceless the sergeants are protecting them from attack tho escort with the colour 
 now moves back to its original position in slow time as it files through the ranks the command present arms 
 is given and every soldier has the opportunity of seeing his colour and of paying it honour the guard with 
 the colour then march past in slow and quick time and thus ends one of the most impressive ceremonies in 
 the army it is a custom that still survives to uphold the traditions of the past among those who arc 
 still serving and whoso duty it is to preserve them another item of interest that is brought to mind by 
 this ceremony is the rank or appointment so often spoken of in the army but few of the present day 
 personnel understand its origin i e colour sergeant these n c os were appointed to take charge of the colours 
 and in some regiments their duty consisted in every week going to the place where the colours were kept and 
 taking them out and airing them to prevent moths also to remove creases in the silk which were caused by 
 their being rolled and cased

 126 by professor andante tutti smorzando n g f 0 8 v d c on april 6th and 7th at 
 the royal victoria theatre the victoria operatic society presented gilbert and sullivan s yeomen of the guard while not equal 
 to their last effort the mikado it was a well finished performance and it is to be regretted that the 
 audiences were not larger possibly the worst fault in the production was a habit i noticeable in nearly all of 
 the cast of singing into the footlights 0:foot 0:lights rather than at the audience while this detracted from the show 
 it was not sufficiently pronounced to seriously impair what was undoubtedly a smooth nicely finished performance among the cast the 
 following were outstanding for their excellent work harry j davis as jack point dorothy parsons as elsie maynard and dr 
 harry johns as sergeant meryll the opera was produced by reginald hincks with christopher wade as i musical director the 
 smooth running of the performance and the i absence of prompting did them much credit i must apologise to my 
 victoria readers for misleading them in the last issue of the music calendar i was informed that i the yeomen 
 of the guard was to be produced on march 2nd and i 3rd but it did not make an appearance 
 until april 6th i shall i be more careful next time on friday april 27th the newly formed eurydice juvenile 
 i art club gave as its maiden production gilbert and sullivan s i h m s pinafore at the empire 
 theatre it was a truly splendid performance the feature of which i was the obvious enjoyment of the children themselves 
 one needed i no reminder to put aside the tradition of the adult production lof the savoy for comparison was 
 neither intended nor needed i judged purely on its merits as a juvenile performance it was i unique a thing 
 apart distinguished by admirable singing and i acting excellent costuming adequate stage setting and i generally good all round production 
 the casting was particularly good the principals showing remarkable talent outstanding beautiful was the work of margaret lennox as josephine 
 also outstanding were w g frampton as ralph bobby mcvie as dick deadeye james mcvie as 
 127 the captain and howard vey as the first lord of the admiralty altogether a very pleasant evening indeed we 
 shall look forward to further doing of the eurydice club this is the season of the year when man s 
 particularly youth s poetic urge manifests itself and i have been besieged with requests to set spring poems to music 
 being one of those people barnum said one as born every minute who are always willing to oblige i promised 
 to look over the material submitted t s i am now of the opinion that what the spring poet needs 
 is not a musician but a hangman there is now a large sign outside my office and the editorial rooms 
 to the effect that spring poems are not required and to make sure that we are not molested further we 
 have three large ferocious or so they sound dogs continually around be warned spring and other poets keep away from 
 my letter box no g minor moose jaw a plagal cadence is not the death rattle of a small pox 
 victim fond of music esquimalt writes to ask how long b coy has had a band and whether he can 
 join he is learning to play the sarrusaphone i am sorry to disappoint you fond of music that wasn t 
 a band you heard it was l cpl hargreaves and pte sha rehearsing for the last smoking concert and i 
 think b coy will agree with me when i say that we certainly have no vacancies for sarrusaphonists 0:sarrusa 0:phonists 
 it is bad enough with saxophonists and clarinetists without any more ists no apologies necessary band scribe winnipeg just carry 
 on the good work but let me have some news next time as everybody will be in camps for the

 128 reunion dinner vancouver 17th march 1954 no 51013 h e creed i m sure col tenßroeke and myself had 
 rather a surprise over our visit to the p p c l i old comrades dinner in vancouver we discussed 
 the thing practically all the way over on the deck of the princess charlotte on a perfect sunshiny spring afternoon 
 to see some of those old familiar faces was a treat we shall not forget for many a day with 
 those pay day smiles we used to see back around ypres truly some had a little less thatch on the 
 old bean with a good sprinkling of grey amongst it also some were a bit heavier in the beam than 
 they were 15 or 16 years ago but years will even effect the old soldier though he merely fades away 
 but to see old harry vjing jimmy mckay keely archy gray palmer slim norris at his best that night frank 
 thiting and harry finlow was a treat to me and i could see col mike ten broeke s eyes smiling 
 with delight when looking over that gathering 0:gather 0:ing of over 50 old pats lyall fraser did the chairman s 
 job in first class style i believe he found the the rum issue himself it was the time to elect 
 officers and i never saw a business meeting handled in so short a time all previous officers being re elected 
 en masse and speeches cut to the minimum but with the continuous mumble of good fellowship it was fairly impossible 
 to get along with any sort of entertainment programme we all wanted to go over some of those old days 
 again and believe me some of the boys have some very vivid memories of what was done both in and 
 out of the trenches especially out of the trenches on pay days i cannot pass up this report the o 
 c asked me to make a report and orders is orders without a kindly thought for those four ladies who 
 slaved the whole day in getting ready the catering and the banquet tables the beef was first class real honest 
 to god cold sirloin the same as i stole once from old 
 129 joy the butcher around poperinghe they did their job freely and well and god bless em a feature of 
 the dinner is worth mentioning we all stood in turn and gave out our name number and regiment one fellow 
 forgot his regimental number rather funny i thought a number of guests were invited from other units among them the 
 old 49th 42nd c es gunners r n etc next year is our 21st birthday and i strongly advise all 
 old timers of the regiment to try their utmost to come to our annual gathering in whatever form it may 
 take place i would also suggest you arrive the day before as sgt smith from kamloops col tenßroeke and my 
 self from victoria did you sort of get used to the beer and are in better form for tho finale 
 wo wore rather disappointed in not seeing any representative from tho regular forces they would have had a wonderful welcome 
 and a h of a good time so in admonishing i say don t let it occur again it is 
 our great pleasure to congratulate major ex sgt g h mullin v c m m on his recent appointment as 
 sergeantat arms 0:sergeant 0:at 0:arms to the saskatchewan legislature major mullin s record with the regiment in france was an

 130 passchendaele 30th october 1917 when the patricia s returned to the ypres salient in october of 1917 one of 
 the greatest battles of the war had been raging it here for noarljr three months from his position on the 
 meotchoele ridge the enemy had a commanding view of the entire british line land it was realized by the british 
 high command that the capture lof this position was vitally necessary the attack was set for october 30th the object 
 of this advance was to gain ground and control of the two spurs which guard the approach to passchendaele ifrom 
 the west and to secure a position overlooking the village the attack was to be made by the third canadian 
 division the patricia s were allotted the sector immediately south of jthe main road including the road itself they were 
 to take the defended positions of duck lodge meetcheele and graf farm in fcheir stride and force meetcheele ridge on 
 their left and graf wood on their right the p ps had the shortest advance of all 2000 yards at 
 most but they were attacking the key position in theory the leading companies were to go through to the final 
 objective while the supporting companies following close fat their heels were to consolidate and garrison an intermediate line after the 
 capture of duck lodge where the most obstinate resistance was expected on the way to the spur during the late 
 evening of october 29th the companies filed forward from abraham heights and into battle positions even thus early three officers 
 lieutenants c f lalor j mckay nd g h beeston were wounded and men in every company were killed however 
 all dispositions were successfully made by feleven p m and an advanced report centre was established at bellevue pill box 
 from which to direct the attack the morning of october 30th broke wet and stormy at 5 50 m the 
 british barrage came down and three minutes later the 
 131 attacking corapanies began to move forward through a veritable sea of mud dealing first with the course of events 
 on the right the low lying ground over which the attack began was completely commanded from the passchendaele height of 
 land and it was in the first advance that the p ps suffered their worst losses every foot of ground 
 had to be gained by the laborious method of pinning down the enemy in front while small parties worked round 
 the flanks and took each individual german post in the rear bombs both british and german were used by the 
 attackers to clear the ground there was little bayoneting on either side but it v as a great day for 
 snipers and most of the patricia s losses came from this source german accuracy ultimately had to yield to the 
 enterprise of the canadian marksmen who pushed ahead threw themselves down close to pill boxes and machine gun posts and 
 covered the advance of the companies by 7 00 a m the right companies had reached the line of duck 
 lodge and were re organizing their all too slender remnants for the further advance the advance by the patricia s 
 left up the main road v as leading to the most dramatic and fateful incident of the day on the 
 3rd division s front the capture of the pill box on the meetcheele spur nos 3 and 1 companies had 
 to drive straight up against the fortified positions of the meetcheele ridge which spat machine gun fire unceasingly upon them 
 these two companies lost all their officers but two in the first advance and it was particularly on the gallantry 
 and leadership of the n c os that the issue depended indeed the casualties were so great that it seemed 
 as though the line must waver or break utterly at this critical moment appeared lieut hugh mackenzie of the brigade 
 machine gunners himself an old no 3 company man and lieut j m christie d c m and sgt g 
 h mullin m m of the regimental snipers while christie made a rush forward on the left found a good 
 position and covered the advance with his deadly marksmanship mackenzie dashed from shell hole to shell hole rallying the survivors 
 for a last effort and leading them on tov ards the pill box mackenzie vras killed at the head of 
 the men he had inspired with his magnificent courage but while he and his party drew the fire mullin was 
 crawling forward up the slope and he actually performed the incredible teat of taking the pill box single handed he 
 rushed a snipers bost in front and destroyed the garrison with bombs and crawling bnto the top of the pill 
 box shot the two machine gunners with his revolver sergeant mullin then rushed to another entrance and compelled the garrison 
 of ten to surrender his gallantry and fearlessness were witnessed by many and although rapid fire pas directed upon him 
 and his clothes were riddled with bullets he never faltered in his purpose and he not only helped to save 
 the situation but also indirectly saved many lives 
 132 so it was that lieutenant mackenzie and sergeant mullin won the first victoria crosses awarded to the patricia s 
 in the war the crest was won while these two companies reached the spur the other two reached a point 
 just short of the road where they were held up by strong machine gun fire from the direction of graf 
 farm the whole battalion dug in parallel to the crossroads 0:cross 0:roads and a little behind it they were reduced 
 to a mere skeleton of the force that had attacked at dawn even on the right the attacking line had 
 dwindled to seventeen rifles after the capture of duck lodge and no 4 company was brought up to support it 
 besides the swamp though the final objectives had to be abandoned the main position had fallen the final dispositions of 
 tho p ps may be given in the wprds of a report of lieut puley despatched at 3 00 p 
 m there are about 100 men out in front of the pill bos these are in charge of three corporals 
 and a lance corporal they are supported on the right by a party sent up by the r c r 
 position for fire is a good one they have 2 lewis guns another party 75 rifles command the ridge and 
 the valley below on the left and join up with the 49th we have 4 lewis guns and a limited 
 supply of ammunition a party of germans approached our trench at about 1 00 p m the artillery replied to 
 our 5 0 3 and had several direct hits dispersing the enemy at present they are moving around under cover 
 of a white flag picking up wounded at 9 30 p m another company from the r c r was 
 sent forward from dad trench to dig and garrison a line in close support of the p ps this reinforcement 
 was accompanied by the officers of the regiment who had been summoned from reserve major sullivan instructed to take over 
 command of the whole firing line and one subaltern each for the right and left sectors the night of october 
 30 31 passed quietly s o s signals went up on the fourth division front on our right at 4 
 15 p m but the artillery opened fire at once and the enemy did not attack the relief of the 
 patricia s which began at 7 00 p m and lasted until midnight was directed throughout by lamp signals by 
 the early hours of november ist the shattered regiment was clear and on its way out general dyer came to 
 pommern castle to thank the p ps personally for their services in his report to general lipsett he paid the 
 regiment one of the most generous tributes they have 
 133 ever received the princess patricia s earned for themselves on that 30th of october deathless glory fierce in attack 
 wise in disposition the work of the whole battalion on that day was of a calibre that would be hard 
 to excel their casualties were very heavy but all ranks lived up to the high traditions of the regiment language 
 like this from the general officer on the spot would only be weakened by other comment but the price of 
 victory was very high twenty out of the twenty five officers engaged were on the casualty list of the n 
 c os and men one hundred and fifty were either killed outright reported missing believed dead or died of their 
 wounds and one hundred and ninety three were wounded a total casualty list of three hundred and sixty three out

 and have played and beaten every senior team in victoria incidentally winning the senior b championship and the times cup 
 they also reached the final of the cowiohan trophy and tied with marpole of the vancouver league for the championship

 winnipeg a regimental boxing tournament was held on april 17th v hich included competitions for open and novice weights these 
 being arranged for the purpose of deciding champions for 1934 35 
 139 on account of the number of entries being small it was decided to run the open competition only training 
 had been in progress since early in march but the number that turned out was very disappointing the precept a 
 man who wishes to box well must train well had appanently been overlooked by a number of contestants the number 
 of entries being below the usual standard it is hoped that more of the personnel will participate in the noble 
 art next year the boxing except in one or two cases was inclined to be too wild and principles were 
 thrown aside for the purpose of getting in a lucky blow it is hoped that more novice competitions will be 
 held in future especially preceding the open competitions this no doubt would unearth some good material which is now lying 
 low in the regiment following is a short summary of the tournament the first bout was a three round contest 
 between pte mensforth a and pte clarke c the decision eventually going to clarke bout no 2 was another three 
 round contest between pte hudson h and pte day j which was won by the latter in good style the 
 winner entered the garrison competition bout no 3 was the final for the light weight championship between pte toner j 
 and pte stoddard l this bout was the tit bit of the evening both contestants went hard and fast from 
 the sound of the gong toner s experience was a great advantage but this did not deter stoddard who fought 
 back with great determination and landed hard blows on toner s target on the final sound of the gong both 
 boys were fighting hard stoddard tiring toner got the decision which he easily won on points stoddard put up a 
 hard and plucky fight and got the best loser s cup the winner entered the garrison competition then came the 
 final of the welterweight competition between pte smith a and pte hughes tj both boys were fit and strong and 
 heavy punches were exchanged in this fight we saw two very distinct styles one rugged and swinging the other steady 
 with straight punches the latter style having no difficulty 0:diffi 0:culty in tinning out hughes got the decision and went 
 on to the garrison competition in the final of the middleweight competition lieut h f cotton met pte taylor t 
 this was taylor s first time in the ring and he fought well against an opponent who has had a 
 lot of ring experience mr cotton got the decision on points without much effort and so entered the garrison competition 
 the final of the light heavyweight competition was between

 the decision after knocking out lobb in the final of the heavyweight corapetition l cpl wilkes c net l cpl 
 woolfson n frora the sound of the gong heavy punching was the order of the day and it was quite 
 clear that this could not go on indefinitely the referee to prevent unnecessary punishment stopped the bout and awarded the 
 decision to wilkes who enters the garrison competition a very interesting and amusing blindfold boxing skit was put on during 
 the evening between the histon brothers and pte disley on the completion of the boxing col niven presented the prizes

 142 the municip lit h s taken it upon itself ith the help of several civic organizations and the naval 
 and military garrisons to arrange a gala sports day on may 24th the program is certainly 0:certain 0:ly a full 
 one so full in fact that the time and space factor will necessitate passing up the usual jumping and eight 
 events to make way for something more spectacular however this should not prove to be a deterrent to the sport 
 loving populace of the district especially in view of the many other unique attractions before we forget all concerned should 
 remember that all you need is a girl friend a bicycle and a little ingenuity to secure two handsome first 
 prizes those for the best dressed girl and the most comical boy on wheels then if you feel like blowing 
 in the prize money ju t take the girl friend along to one of the many hot dog stands or 
 perhaps she prefers pop and do the honours you can then slip over to the playing field and enjoy a 
 good game of football or if your prize has not gone to your head the young lady might hold your 
 pop bottle while you roll up your pants and dust off the mile or any of the shorter runs and 
 sprints on the bill by this time you will have at least two more prizes and probably will have invested 
 in several ice cream cones it would bo a good moment to pause between licks to examine the facial contortions 
 of the navy and army huskies glowering at each other from opposite ends of a stout piece of rope or 
 if this palls much enjoyment can always be derived from watching the r c a s c bash in the 
 backs of their skulls with the butts of their lances for those who are wator minded the gorge is prepared 
 to offer an array of redskins and palefaces skipping canoes over the surface of the briny and of course you 
 can always go to the dogs to spend the remainder of your prize money in wondering which of the whippets 
 can stretch the farthest at the highest rate of speed between the starting post and the finishing tape it is 
 worthy of note that the committee has taken special cognizance of the more unfortunate members of the community in offering 
 special prizes snd free admission to persons on relief and the last but not least item on the program will 
 be the blowing off of some 0500 worth of perfectly good fireworks the colonel s wife sent the following note

 keep so calm with all the noise and how do they hear the commands when the band is playing i 
 should think they would make a mistake i i should think the officers might give a wrong command in all

 yarn was told by one of the indoor rifle team at winnipeg on his return from annual furlough this year 
 whilst on furlough i travelled around quite a bit u ne day i happened to find myself in a small 
 railroad town up west when i discovered i would have a considerable wait there i strolled over to the hotel 
 opposite the depot here i found the usual bunch of natives sitting around the stove and settling the affairs of 
 the world i joined the circle and after a short time one of the natives began to tell of the 
 good hunting to be found in those parts as well as some of the wonderful shots he had made one 
 after another they told of their prowess with the gun finally one of them turned to me and said do 
 you shoot mister yes i served in the p p c l i for a few years and did a 
 considerable amount of shooting what was the best shot you ever made i was asked why i never kept track 
 of them the men in my regiment were all good shots we used to practice every chance we had but 
 they were insistent recal any particular one nov you mention it i do recall one shot i said i remember 
 having one of the men set up a page of newspaper 0:news 0:paper edgewise at 50 yards i shot the 
 type off both sides without 0:with 0:out breaking the paperl one by one the natives quietly filed out of the 
 hotel and left me alone to wait for my train s c 5 
 146 private rollings scores corporal l c morrison captain harris tho company commander was holding forth on the virtues of 
 a first class educational certificate for soldiers remember men he said that one of the essential qualifications that goes toward 
 making a good soldier is a high standard of education it is not sufficient that he understands the mechanism of 
 his rifle or has the ability to lay do m a good clean kit for inspection a twinkle came to 
 his eyes he must also possess more than a rudimentary knowledge of history geography mathematics map reading and english he 
 should be able to converse intelligently upon topics of current interest he should know how to speak and write correctly 
 how to avoid grammatical pit falls he broke off to stare at some dust on the floor which had attracted 
 his attention endeavoured to sweep it aside with the point of his stick pte rollings amused watched him interior economy 
 he murmured facetiously those who heard him laughed hollings was an old soldier and a popular one at that a 
 warrior of the old school hollings had no time for this educytion stuff as he called it and anathematised all 
 those who endeavoured to instil it into him a spyde s a spyde was his philosophy thy say interior economy 
 when yer means fatigues i ain t got no truck wiv this ere alf crawhn talk presently the company commander 
 a slight trace of annoyance on his face he feared dust as a surgeon fears bacteria looked up the ranks 
 stiffened there is little more i can add men hc resumed you all know as well as i do the 
 importance of education and the difference it makes to your pay he paused then does anyone 0:any 0:one wish to 
 ask any questions there was a profound silence come along don t bo frightened he added encouragingly then came the 
 bombshell pte hollings took a short smart pace forward stood 0:for 0:ward 0:stood rigidly to attention a low murmur rolled 
 along the ranks sergeant evans the oldest soldier in the regiment and hollings avowed enemy frowned darkly the r s 
 ms moustache moved up and down liko a signaller waving his arms about

 think hollings he began a little schooling would do you a world of good your grammar could certainly do with 
 a little brushing up you have a bad habit of dropping your aspirates which must jar on the ears of 
 your comrades he paused the recruits grinned hollings face clouded but it ain t no use sir i m too

 parlance on the peg he was charged by sergeant evans with failing to obey an order given by his superior 
 officer capt harris was surprised hollings was a good soldier and bore an exemplary character he looked up at the 
 nonchalent accused what have you to say he demanded hollings met his gaze with an equanimity that did him credit 
 i deny the charge sir he spoke slowly confidently the company commander was perplexed are you suggesting sergeant evans is 
 lying not exactly that sir but he is mistaken he has no evidence sir capt harris made a mental note 
 of the carefully sounded aspirates he turned to the sergeant whose dark face bore the expression of an early christian 
 martyr did you give the order that the company were to come on parade without side arms yes sirl thats
