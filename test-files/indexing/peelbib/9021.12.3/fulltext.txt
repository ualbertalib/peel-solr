 the 6 th of june 1886 several other fellows and i arrived in calgary to help build the eau claire
 mills and pitched our tents on the bank of the bow the machinery had all been shipped from eau claire
 wisconsin in several carloads and us the american cars could not come through we had to unload all the machinery
 and reload it at winnipeg this took one week everything had to be brought with us as at that time
 you couldn t buy even a six inch spike in calgary on our travels through the town we at fourth
 street east the fare being fifty noticed there weren t any pretty women cents each way which was reasonable to
 look at and one fellow fred furrow enough but sometimes when it was in said if there aren t any
 women here midstream it forgot which way it was this must be hell another chap travelling there were very few
 settlers charles hammer who didn t care for north of the bow in the fall when the women said th
 is was the place for him water was low we used to ford the river and he would stay they
 asked me what from near the present seventh street i thought about it and i told them it west to
 about one hundred feet east of didn t concern me much this fred far the hillhurst bridge row said if
 there weren t any girls to kiss he was going right back to eau i was usually the first one
 up in the claire i advised him to stay and told morning and one morning when i went him that
 kissing the girls was a bad down to the river to get water i saw a habit anyway it was
 like eating soup nice yellow keg floating there not with a fork you never got enough knowing whether it had
 anything in it i went out and got it the contents were but there is always a way around tasted
 and proved to be whiskey whisif you look for it and in this case it was key was not allowed
 in those days and easy we had the native daughters of when smugglers saw that they were that day there
 were plenty of them going to be caught they threw their and many lived in elbow park too they loads
 into the river and then rescued painted themselves just as the women them again as they floated downstream of today
 do but they did not wear silk this was one of these kegs one man dresses and silk stockings as
 the young in camp offered me fifty dollars for the ladies of the present time they always keg intending to
 sell it in town kept themselves rolled up in a blanket these blankets had black stripes on there were several
 in camp includthem some having just one and others ing the boss that were opposed to liquor two three or
 four the more stripes of any kind a conference was held as these girls had on their blankets the to
 what should be done with it the prohigher they were in society so if a hibitionists decided it should be
 poured fellow could make friends with a girl down a gopher hole i felt that it would with four stripes
 on her blanket he knew not have done any harm to let me have he had the cream of the
 land the fifty dollars and responsible human at th at time t h e r e weren t any beings
 have the whiskey instead of bridges across the river except the rail drowning dumb gophers with it the road bridges
 there was a ferry boat whiskey was dumped and the laugh was this paper ices written scieral years ago by
 mr strom and wos obtained from calgary power liiniterl 1 on me in my opinion their reasoning along he whirled
 the indian around was not very well balanced and i told and kicked him in the back them so the
 indian started down the ice yell that first fall we spent driving piles ing very loudly with conrad following building
 platforms and erecting ma after him kicking all the time the chinery in the mill which had been built woman
 with her load also started to run during the summer our first logs were and yell i followed up with
 the team brought in from banif by railroad and load of logs and enjoyed it all very much when the
 water was low in the fall we deepened the channel dredging the about five hundred feet down the gravel over
 to the middle of the river river another gang of men were working from the south side in order to
 be able to th ey were the prohibitionists when float the logs down to the mill after they heard the
 racket they came running the river was frozen solid we started to us and telling conrad to stop chasing to
 drive piles for the booms to hold the the indians logs when the indian and his wife got the bow
 river was tricky then as a fair distance away they turned around it is now sometimes there was hardly and
 gave us a good talking to but what enough water for our boilers and then they said we did not
 know these prothere would be big floods that would hibitionists were the same men that gave drive us off the
 river there wasn t any my whiskey to the goph ers and conrad calgary power limited up the river and
 i did not have much faith in their at that time that could be blamed for judgment they said the
 indians said the actions of the river or anyone else they were going back ‘ to camp to get the
 interfering with the r i v e r but the rest of the indians and would come trouble was there
 all the same back to scalp us all the truth is we all felt a little uneasy except conrad we
 had heard lots of stories of the it didn t worry him he said if they indians and what to
 expect of them but weren t any better than that indian he the scalpers did not come there was a
 could trim th em all the indians conbig indian camp along the river near tinued to come for wood but
 they kept shaganappi and they used to come over a safe distance from where conrad was where we were working
 and pick up wood there was one great six foot the boom was finished that winter indian who would walk
 around and and we were ready for the drive in the point out the wood for his wife to pick
 spring of 1887 up and carry she carried two babies the first eau claire company drive on her back in
 her shawl and carried started in the spring of 1887 and as it the wood in front she was so
 loaded was their first drive on the bow river down that she could just wobble along it was a hard
 one there were windfalls and obstructions on the river every conrad a big strong man in the where it was
 a very sad affair as six gang tied up a bundle of wood and hung of the drivers were drowned
 at kananit on the indian s shoulder to make him askis falls the crew were crossing understand that he should
 carry it and the river in a big boat above th e falls not pile it all on the woman
 the indian as they had done many times before took the wood off his own shoulder and but this particular
 morning the current hung it also on the woman then was a great deal stronger than they conrad took the
 indian over to where had figured on as there had been a we were loading logs on a sleigh while
 considerable amount of rain the night i was lifting one end of the log conrad before before they reached the
 other tried to make the indian lift the other side they lost control of the boat and end on to
 the sleigh but it was impos were swept fast towards the falls sible to make him do it he tried
 but he would not lift then conrad told the there were nine men in the boat and indian he wasn
 t any good and to get when they saw that they couldn t make clajrr bowr umber co the eau
 claire mill was a landmark along the bow river at calgary the tall smokestack at right was one of the
 tallest structures in the town during the l 88 fys it they steered the boat right for the territories at
 that time the eau claire falls the boat jumped the first falls and company put in their share and they
 took in some water it jumped the built the bridge and it was called the second falls and took in
 more water bow marsh bridge when it went over the third falls it went under and six men were thrown
 it went out in a flood several years out and killed against the rocks before later after which the louise
 bridge was they had had any chance to save them built the government was in edmonton selves the three men
 who didn t strike then and w h cush ing was minister the rocks came out without being hurt of
 public works the second bridge at all the bodies of five of the victims was named after mr cushing s
 eldest were found later during the summer daughter louise and that stood till the in log jams but the sixth
 was never present hillhurst bridge was built which recovered the hillhurst people wanted named after their subdivision it took all
 summer to get the drive into calgary that year it was so cold in the fall of 1888 the eau
 claire cornthat there was thin ice on the still water pany drove the piles for the first bridge every morning
 in the early fall and th ere across the elbow on ninth avenue east wasn t much sawing done where
 the present bridge stands a construction company then built the bridge that winter 1887 88 the eau claire in those
 days calgary was a very dull company built the first traffic bridge place as there were no places to go
 over the bow river it was built on then finally the salvation army came piles just about where the hillhurst
 to town they started their meetings in bridge is now there was a land agent boynton hall on eight avenue
 east in town by the name of marsh he per there were three fine girls that came suaded the town
 to contribute towards to open up the meetings a captain a the cost of the bridge and also the lieutenant
 and a cadet their meetings north west assembly at regina which were well attended by men all the time was
 the government for the north west when the drivers got in in the fall th ere would be about thirty
 of us alto coal was very expensive and it was gether who would go down in a body hard for
 them to carry on in the spring accompanied by mr brown an older of 1889 representatives of the light cornman
 who was our self appointed guard pany made arrangements with the eau ian claire company to furnish them with driving
 power for their dynamoes the the officers of the army were great lumber company had lots of sawdust beggars and
 were nearly always suc and cheap fuel and were planning to cessful in getting what they wanted install their own
 planing mill so they including household goods and so on could plane their own lumber which one particular time the
 captain was previously had been done by the cushasking for a mirror she said she did ing lumber company the
 necessary not want a small one but a good sized machinery was ordered which consisted one of two return tubular
 boilers 50 h p mr brown suggested that we the each and a 100 h p corliss engine thirty of
 us should buy the mirror and which was to run the planers in the he would present it we all
 ch ipped in daytime and the light dynamoes at night and bought a large one that required the machinery arrived
 and was untwo men to carry it to the hall the loaded on first avenue wh ere the first meeting
 had already started when we eau claire light plant was to be built reached there so we hid the mirror
 under the steps at the close of the when the manager of the edison meeting the captain asked if anyone
 company saw the machinery down had brought th e mirror that she had there he wanted to know if it
 wasn t asked for previously henry brown to be installed up town mr prince went up to the platform and
 started to explained that that would be impossible make a presentation speech and asked as the lumber would have to
 be hauled some of the boys to go out and get the up there planed and then hauled back while
 it was only a small job for the mirror electric company to move th eir dynamoes in the meantime some
 of us had down to where the planing mill was to taken the mirror around to the back be built
 the edison company then re there was quite a good deal of corn fused to use the eau claire company
 motion when the mirror was missing and power old mr brown chewed his tobacco harder than ever which was one
 of the evils the eau claire company now had that the army was preaching against twice as much machinery as
 was re however the presentation was finally quired to run the planing mill and made by one of us who
 had taken the decided to run a light plant of their own mirror and hidden it the speaker when and
 applied for a charter from the town making the presentation said he ad the owners of the present light company
 mitted to being a sinner and not a hypo opposed that and were then willing to crite like some of
 the others bring ‘ their dynamoes down to first avenue but mr prince had his own in 1889 the eau
 claire company plans in mind the few people that started their first light plant but it was were using lights
 principally stores and not the first light system in calgary as hotels were paying a big price and there was
 a small company called the were anxious to see another company edison system operating in the alley in operation back
 of the bank of montreal they had two high speed uncondensing engines d w marsh was the mayor of the
 belted direct on to two dynamoes and town at the time and he called a meettwo boilers these boilers had
 not been ing in the fire hail on sixth avenue east looked after properly and were blistered i k kerr
 p a prince and mr moon and burned in the bottom so the water president of the north west lumber
 cornwas running into the fire there wasn t pany of eau claire wisc were invited any boiler inspection at that
 time if to be present james lougheed the there h ad been they would not have lawyer he was not
 a senator then adbeen allowed to run dressed the meeting and said these 4 gentlemen had money to invest and
 the they were ready to back mr prince with question was were they going to invest what money he required
 and for refertheir money in calgary or go elsewhere ence mentioned certain banks in mm he thought it was a
 good thing for cal neapolis and eau claire gary a man at the back of the room a vote was
 th en taken with those got up and said that it was easily seen in favor of the new company
 going to that mr lougheed was being paid for the east side of the building and those talking that night
 mr lougheed waved opposed to the west the greater part his hand to the speaker and said you of the
 audience crowded over to the are a liar sir the man at the back east side leaving about a dozen
 people of the room then replied that he would mostly shareholders in the first company see mr lougheed the next
 day on the west side the mayor declared several of the stockholders of the first that the eau claire company
 should company were present at the meeting be allowed to start a light plant and raised a number of objections
 one but the road was not yet open for was th at the new company was going the eau claire
 company the first cornto install a plant carrying 1000 volt pany was having financial trouble and alternating current and it
 would be the bank of montreal at eighth avenue dangerous the old system was direct and first street west had
 taken it over current and low voltage dr lafferty the manager of the bank was the directalthough interested in the
 old company ing manager of the light company and said the safety point was not worth he strongly opposed the
 starting of a considering as the eau claire company new company and demanded that the knew better than to put
 up something eau claire company should first prove that would injure anyone that its system was not dangerous before another
 stockholder of the edison being allowed to go ahead company said it is well enough to the eau claire company
 said they let them start but where is their money knew noth ing about electricity nor did they h ave
 a few wheels down on the anyone else in calgary at that time river bank that are not worth much
 and the stockholders of the dynamo cornif we allow them to put up poles on the pany in eau claire
 and the stockholders streets they may go broke and then we would have the poles on our hands this interior
 view of the eau claire light i k kerr and mr moon who was known plant was taken in the
 1890 s the control as a millionaire at that time both said panel at right is preserved in the glenbow
 foundation museum in calgary the employees of the eau claire company are seen in this photo taken in the early
 1890 s of the lumber company were principally handled properly is perfectly safe he the same men and the eau
 claire corn then spoke at some length describing pany said they would send for walter his system and the people
 decided that k freeman the inventor of the system his system would be the proper one to to come here
 and explain it they wrote install him and he agreed to come he said he would discuss his system with
 anyone all these negotiations had taken conin canada that the citizens wished to siderable time and it was now fall
 the appoint shareholds of the old company insisted that a date should be set when the new a meeting was
 called to be held in company lights must be in operation the old town hall an old frame building if
 the lights were not running by that where the city hall now stands mr date their contract would be void
 freeman arrived on the date set the council chamber was packed but the as they knew that poles couldn t
 be town of calgary did not have anyone cut and hauled to the railroad in the to oppose him the
 manager of the short time allowed they thought they bank of montreal asked mr freeman had already won their case
 but the eau to defend h is system mr freeman claire company were also figuring asked what the charges were
 against they sent to vancouver for three carhis system he said he would have to loads of cedar square timbers
 6 x 12 and hear the charges before he could defend 30 feet long the next week the timbers it
 arrived and as they had their own sawmills they ripped the poles diagonally then the manager of the bank of
 and made two poles out of one and for montreal said i can stand in a tub the corners they
 had bigger timbers of water up to my knees and take one that is how all th e first eau
 claire poles wire in each hand with my system but were square ceaar ones you cannot do that with yours
 mr freeman replied i will admit mr mr freeman sent his brother here braithwaite can get into a tub of
 water to install the system they strung wires to his knees and take a wire in each and wired the
 houses and had the lights hand but he will only do it once with on three days before the scheduled
 time your system if you put your hand into when the poles were up the old company a circular saw
 when it is in operation complained that they were too narrow you will get cut our system when at the
 top the new company main 6 tamed that they would be all right when both companies operated for some they
 got the wires on them the old time and then finally the first company company said that they put poles
 up had to shut down we had only the to hold the wires and not wires to hold one machine
 and were carrying about the poles the right lcad when the old company went broke applications kept coming the first
 night we started we h ad all in to get on our system we were althe hotels along ninth avenue
 our ready running to capacity so when the load was 200 16 candle power lamps old company finally gave up
 notices as our lights were bright we finally got went out from the eau claire company all the hotels except
 the alberta when that the price of lights would be raised the bar rooms were full at night our lights
 would go out and the crowds there was a great kick about that would move over to the alberta hotel
 from the people quite a number could mr freeman soon knew there was some not afford to pay th e
 new rate and had thing wrong and finally th ey caught two the lights cut out those who had to
 of the old company s linemen climbing have lights had to pay the price while the poles and pulling the
 transformer the people were complaining the comfuses they were arrested heavily fined pany said when we are able to make
 and ordered to leave town then things as much money carrying 500 lights as went along fine 1000 we would
 be very foolish not to take advantage of it we were carrying 1000 volts on the primary lines and 50
 volts on the second in the early days there were no ary no insulation was used except unions or government
 regulations in rewhat was on the wire entry blocks gard to labor long h ours and low were cut of
 wood and wooden rosettes wages was one of the eau claire comand wooden cleats were used the rates pany s
 ways to success and when the were so much per lamp the meter did old company went out of existence
 they not come into use till the system was had the advantage of being the only changed to 2000 volts
 ones in business they raised the price of lights considerably but did not raise as time went on we got
 more and the wages of their employees more business our lights were good and th e old company s were
 weak in as time went on they found that power the old company carried on for they did not have
 enough power to carry some time finally sending to eau claire their load so decided to start to build for
 a dynamo the same as ours after a water power plant th ere were certain installing their new dynamo they
 were rights that they had to get from ottawa able to take over the bad customers but some of the
 calgary citizens were that eau claire cut off previously our opposed to that and the late dr lafferty lights would
 not work on their system and two other men were appointed as a delegation to go to ottawa to oppose
 but we had more trouble with our the granting of the charter when the poles mr prince was called to
 a coun delegation arrived in ottawa they were cil meeting to hear complaints about the told that mr lougheed had
 made all unsightly poles and was asked if he the arrangements a month previous would paint those on ninth eighth
 and in 1893 the water power plant was seventh avenues mr prince said oh started and we got two wheels
 running certainly i will paint them and in that fall it was only in operation a quired if that was
 all that was required short time the dam running over to of him one of the counciflors said yes the
 hillhurst fire hail was not built at that is all mr prince had agreed to that time and when winter
 came we were paint the poles mr prince picked up short of water in the spring when the his hat
 and walked out as he was river opened up the two wheels were leaving he said i never said when
 started again and ran successfully mind you i will paint the poles when i am ready he never got ready
 and in the fall of 1893 when the water they were never painted was low we built the hillhurst dam
 the 7 bow river then showed its tricks al times the lights were pretty dim the though there was no
 one up the river customers complained but no rebates interfering with it at that time we had were made the
 only thing that could all our scaffolding built across the river be done if the service was not satisto carry
 our pile driver and engine and factory was to have the lights cut off were just starting to drive our
 solid work the weather had been fine but it h ad i remember coming into the eau been colder up
 west than it had been claire office one day when r b bennett in calgary there had been a big
 ice was there he turned to me and said jam up the river somewhere that had your lights were pretty
 poor last night held the water back as i remember it theodore i could hardly find my bed it was
 on thanksgiving day at about the manager spoke up and said thethree o clock in the afternoon and we adore
 couldn t help it we had an ice were working on the river when a wall jam somewhere on the
 river last night of water and ice five feet high came and we were short of water mr bensweeping down
 on us nett said short of water that s funny the lights looked as though they had too we all
 ran for shore as fast as we much water in them were able to the ice jam took all the
 false work except the span where the on a n a t h e r occasion dr mackid pile driver
 and engine were standing drove down to the water power plant the flood handled the big 34 foot square with
 his horse and buggy there were timbers as though they were matches no cars in those days and complained as
 nothing more could be done that day about the lights as they were so dim the boss said we could
 go and have our i told him th at we were doing all that thanksgiving dinner we could there and
 that he had better make his complaint to the manager dr th e next morning a crew of men and
 mackid took the manager up to his house teams went down each side of the river to look at the
 lights and was told that and rescued the timbers it took a week they were all right but that he
 did not before we could get started again and have enough of them then the river flooded once more it
 the bow river caused me a lot of interferred several times before we got trouble after my arrival in calgary
 as the dam across near as i can remember it was in the we ran through that winter success spring
 of 1894 that we had our biggest fully with our water power with only flood the whole sunnyside and the
 two wheels it did not require a great flat on the south side of the river were deal of water
 to run them but the load under water all that could be seen kept increasing and more power was of
 prince s island were the tree tops needed so more wheels were added until the bow marsh bridge went out
 in this we had seven the wheels and ma flood chinery worked fine but the water pro there were some
 families living position was a different thing when the along the river between second and water came to calgary we
 managed to third streets east the men were away help it along when it jammed up west working and the
 women came down to we couldn t do anything but wait till the eau claire office and asked mr it
 came through which sometimes took prince what they should do mr prince a week we were then running with told
 them to stay right in their homes bdth steam and water the steam plant and he would put a man
 on to watch always worked perfectly but when the the river and their homes orders were river ran dry some
 of the lights would given for two teams to be hitched up in go out as the steam plant could
 not the barn and a half a dozen men who carry them all were sleeping in the bunkhouse were to
 be ready if they were needed to move the business lights were kept going the families but the residence lights
 were left off till the water came up again the voltage as our water wheels were standing was supposed to
 be fifty volts but some in dead water i was sent to watch the floating logs held in the eau
 claire boom at calgary were a familiar sight in the early days the above photo was taken in about 1911
 houses with instructions to go for help years old with a cow in the water he if the water reached
 the threshold be had been taking the cow to the channel tween two and three o clock th at morning
 for a drink and the cow had slipped in the water began to play on the door off the ice
 the boy thought that she steps within half an inch of going into was going to drown th ere was
 only the houses then part of the bank about five feet of water in the channel washed away and the
 water started to but for just one person to get that cow drop the houses were now about forty back
 on the ice looked like quite a job feet from the edge of the river if you didn t know
 how there was one house on th e north i told the boy to be quiet and we side of
 the bow it was about 900 feet would soon get the cow out i went to northeast of the present
 hillhurst bridge the tool house and got a rope and put and was occupied by mrs mchugh and it around
 the cow s neck and choked the her family several mounted policemen wind out of her the cow puffed up
 were sent to watch that house and move and floated like a rubber ball i threw the family out early
 in the morning when some stop logs into the sluice way and the water was almost into the house then
 i pulled the cow on to th e ice mrs mchugh protested against being without any trouble we got the
 rope moved until th e water actually started off and she got her wind back quickly coming into the house
 but the police and walked off home without being any officer insisted as he said when the the worse for
 it in the afternoon the critical time came they might not be boy and his father and mother came able
 to move them down to the mill to thank me for my help they said th e cow meant a
 good two or three years afterwards the deal to them and wanted to know where bow river flooded again to
 be followed i had learned that trick i told them quite a number of years later by the that i
 had seen it done on the lakes in flood that took out the old centre street norway when horses occasionally
 broke bridge through the ice one winter when going up the river the customers generally came to the from the
 power house i heard some one office to pay their bills th ere were hollering as loud as he could
 as i some bad accounts and their bills were got closer i could see a boy about twelve given to
 a collector that worked on com mission if he failed to get the money in the spring of 1904 we
 changed then we were given the bill with instruc the old system of 1000 volts to 2200 volts tions to
 get the money or cut off the the company installed two babcock and lights wilcox water tube boilers they were
 the first water tube boilers that came into there was a house called the chap the west they also put
 in a robb corman boarding house south of the track liss engine with a generator of 360 k w the
 proprietor of that place was a pretty then we were in a position to carry on bad customer to get
 money out of and whether the water power was running we were sent to get the money or cut or
 not her off she claimed that she had paid for all the fixtures and ran down the at ‘ this
 time meters were installed company in general we agreed with in all houses where the flat rate had everything she
 said not crossing her at been in use before i remember the first all she complained that the lights were
 meter inspector that came to calgary not in the righ t place we lengthened i do not remember his name
 but he was her cords and put her lights where she middle aged man with black whiskers wanted them cleaned
 the lamps and he was passing th rough the town and spent about an hour altogether agreeing just stopped off
 to inspect the eau claire with everything she said meters as the company had no spare meters the meters had
 to be removed the first company was still running from the houses and brought down to at this time and
 their wires were just outside on the same pole as ours our the plant and then installed in the lights
 were on th e transformer system houses again on the same day which meant a lot of work and so
 would not work on their lines we knew that but she did not we a place was fixed up in
 the repair figured we would get the money the shop adjoining the engine room th ey next day as we
 were leaving we told wired up one side of the wall and put her we would have to cut the
 lights off in a lot of switches when the meter or we would lose our jobs and offered had been
 hooked on and the switches to notify the other company to connect thrown in the whole wall took fire the
 her up so that she would not be without short circuit made an awful noise i ran light that nigh
 t then she said you from the engine room to see what the are the nicest boys i have ever
 met trouble was th e meter inspector had and paid us the money taken his instruments and was running that
 is the way it worked a good towards town our old friend louis and many times by jollying the customers
 his helper were putting out the fire along we did not have a great deal of this happened about eleven
 o clock trouble getting the money in the morning and we thought the one time i did not get the
 money inspector would be back in the afternoon though i was sent to a woman who kept to finish his
 job but he never came back a coffee shop on eighth avenue near we didn t know anything about inspect
 centre street the bill was for 27 00 ing meters and i don t think this man and i had
 strict orders to get th e whole did either th e meters had all been amount or cut her off
 the line when brought in new from the factory so i i gave her the bill she took 20 00
 out do not think there was anything wrong of her stocking and said she would give with them louis said
 that was a good me that if i would receipt the bill in full way to get rid of a
 troublesome beggar and leave the lights on i told her that it was impossible for me to do that but
 we had been running twenty five that i would enquire at the office if th ey arc lights for the
 town under a five year would accept that amount she put the contract this contract was now up and money
 away again and said oh no the town wanted fifty lights instead of b oth you and your company can
 go to the twenty five the eau claire corn hell that night she left town and that pany would not
 agree to supply these money was lost to the company alto without another five year contract as it gether meant
 the installation of more ma 10 chinery the town would only give a the transformers and sockets on the old
 one year contract so the town was forced service all had to be changed as the to put in their
 own plant which they voltage on the lamps had been 50 volts did in 1905 when they installed two and
 with the new system it was inwater tube boilers and a robb engine creased to 110 volts we had to
 do it on ninth avenue west where the present gradually running with both systems sub station is the town added
 to and for a whale operated there until about 1911 or 1912 when they moved to victoria park it has
 been said to me by different parties and on several occasions that ii when the town of calgary started they
 had been here in the early days to operate a light plant the price of light they would have had
 a million dollars went down and the taxes went up it now getting a million is a big job did

 given by the n w m p at bow river on the night of dec 30 th i was surprised
 to find th at an entertainment so grand could be got up in such an out of the way place
 arriving at the barracks we were amazed to find such large pleasant rooms beautifully lighted up the dancing hail was
 a spacious room neatly fitted up with festooris of evergreens relieved by the union jack at one end and the
 crown of our sovereign at the other the whole being lighted up with three large chandeliers th e floor managers
 did all in their power to make the entertainment a pleasure to the guests in which they succeeded admirably the
 programme which consisted of songs recitations and dancing was lengthy but not at all tedious after enjoying the dance for
 some time supper was announced when all repaired to the dining hall where was found a sumptious repast the tables
 groaning beneath their loads of delicacies supper being over the dancing hall was again resorted to when the rest of
 the night was pleasantly passed and all took their leave feeling that it was the greatest of the kind ever
 witnessed in the great north west letter from j s m manitoba free press march 20 1876 11 along the

 while edmonton town and settlement have been in existence almost from time immemorial until 1883 the stretch of country between
 edmonton and calgary was as vacant of settlement as the sea in 1883 settlement at red deer was begun and
 like that at edmonton grew slowly from that time until 1891 but even in 1891 it amounted to very little
 and the traveller between calgary and edmonton saw only th e stage stations and stopping places for freighters in all
 that 200 miles of fertile and beautiful country in july of 1890 the calgary and contingent of the future population
 of edmonton railway was commenced at the surrounding country will be drawn calgary and completed to red deer the from
 nebraska same fall in august of 1891 it was besides the nebraska men a number completed to edmonton and at

 to see it before have been the future progress and prosmaking up their minds to go in and perity of
 olds is assured by the way possess it it was not until the spring the point on the old trail
 which corresof 1892 that the rush of people actually ponds with olds on th e railway line was began known
 by the much more appropriate the fifty miles of plain lying im and pleasing name of lone pine mediately north
 of calgary is still just twenty miles north of olds is innisas it was before the railway was built fail
 station and town claimed by its showing that it is not the railroad but residents to be the brightest smartest
 the kind of country that is the attraction and most growing town along the whole on nearing olds the third
 station north line at this point the railway crosses of calgary at the point where the park the old trail
 just north of content s stopcountry joins the plain the first signs ping place the first settlers in ‘ this
 of new settlement are seen little log vicinity named the locality poplar grove and frame houses dot the prairie in
 all from the beautiful groves of poplar which directions on the slopes or smooth grassy crown the low hills all
 around leaving knolls and in the shelter or cosy looking wide stretches of smooth sloping grassy clumps of poplar and
 willow th is is prairie between wood and water are the youngest of the settlements along more abundant than at
 olds while there the line and consequently the town is is still plenty of open land for grazing as yet
 chiefly in imagination however or farming and the rocky mountains there is the station an immigrant shed one of the
 grandest sights in the world a store and an hotel and the enterpris still in full view form the background

 child houses in the town of innisfail were ren who are to be there next summer erected in the spring
 of 1891 and at the a c o 1 o n y from nebraska cf which close of 1892 the

 is every assurance that a large and indeed everything that goes to 12 a historic moment occurred on the calgary

 of course but been added to very greatly in the past a small part of the land is yet brought

 keep cattle and make butter and during ihat in the matter of stock carried and the past summer a large
 quantity of buildings occupied would be a credit butter was shipped from innisfail to cal to a place three times

 is a red deer at this point is about 500 feet small saw mill owned by leo gaetz wide with
 swift current stony bottom which has converted a great deal of the and perfectly clear mountain water the surrounding spruce
 bluffs into lumber flat upon which the station and town are red deer is an important distributing situated is perfectly
 level and clear of point and having the abundant water everything but the very smallest brush supply of the river
 has advantages for the soil is lightly sandy so th at the dis which none of the towns present or
 precomfort of heavy mud in wet weather is spective between that place and calavoided gary can possibly have there is
 an the town of red deer like that of immense coal deposit fourteen miles innisfail was only begun in the
 spring down the river which will no doubt be of 1892 the railroad having arrived late utilized shortly and will
 add to the in the previous fall the original town importance of the place if it could be so called
 was about three nine miles north of red deer the miles further up the river where the railway crosses the
 blind man s river a old trail crossed there the stores of fine stream coming from the wet tim messrs
 gaetz th e real pioneer of the bered country to the west and flowing place and burch were situated also
 into the red deer only two or three miles the mounted police station and three or further east blackfalds siding
 is just four other houses but the establishment north of the blind man s river valley of the railway crossing
 and station on on the upland the grade out of the valley the next flat below entirely killed the to
 the north being too heavy to permit town at the old crossing and caused the of the siding being placed
 actually on removal of whatever business had been the river although there is no station 13 at this siding the
 train stops to deliver 200 miles east of the railway crossing mail and generally has some passenger and the country
 through which it flows or freight business to do at the same for that whole distance is probably the point
 owing to the number of settlers finest area of agricultural land that the who have gone into that neighborhood north
 west contains the station is on but owing to the rolling nature of the gently rising ground on the west
 bank country very few houses can be seen of the river and could not be improved off to the east
 six or eight miles can upon as a townsite but unfortunately be seen a range of wooded hills lying for
 its prospects it is cut off to the southnorth and south through which the red west west and north by
 a large block river breaks in its course eastward of indian reserves which occupy the causing an immense canyon or
 very best agricultural land in the vicinity deep narrow valley with precipitous from the station the river runs northbanks in
 this canyon is found one of erly for seven or eight miles the railway the most remarkable seams of coal
 following its west bank and about three known to exist in the north west there miles north of the point
 at which the is a face of over 40 feet of clear coal river bends off to the northeast is
 a exposed for a distance of three or four siding at the indian settlement of bears miles along the side
 of the valley above hill where there is a roman catholic the water edge and no one yet knows mission
 four or five miles southeast how far the face extends below the sur of this siding is the battle river
 agency face of the water and a methodist mission at this point the first station north of red deer is
 a beautiful plain begins wh ich extends lacombe about a mile east of barnett s from bears hill to the
 big stone creek stopping place on the old calgary trail about fourteen miles from south to north the country here
 is somewhat more by about the same distance from east broken than at any other point on the to west
 beginning at the battle river line and while it offers some farming on the east which still flows northerly locations
 that for situation and quality to a point about ten miles due east of of soil cannot be surpassed this
 section wetaskiwin station and running westof country is best suited for stock raising ward to the solid timber on the
 west there is abundance of hay plenty of this section of country is very slightly water and plenty of rolling
 land with undulating prairie of rich soil and rank the very best of pasture on it to the growth of
 grass there are streams and east lies the same range of timbered lakes all around but none of any account
 hills mentioned as laying east of blind on it however well water can be had man and to the west
 is the almost solid in abundance all over the plain at about forest of poplar and spruce which ex ten
 to twenty five feet there is very tends to the base of the rocky mountains little willow or scrub and
 the land is there is a post office at th is station and easily broken for crop it is no
 wonder a small store but there seems to be that this choice section of country has no reason why a
 good town should not attracted a very large number of settlers spring up here as no doubt it will next
 during the season probably more than summer any other point south of edmonton twenty miles n o r t h
 of lacombe the town of wetaskiwin now conthrough the same kind of country suit taming three or four fine general
 stores able chiefly for stock raising is ponoka a larger hotel than any other place bestation on the battle river
 this river tween calgary and edmonton with a unlike the streams further south has a population nearly as large as
 innisfail scarcely perceptable valley the stream had no existence in th e beginning of rises in pigeon and battle lakes
 about august last this place has made a 50 miles to th e northwest in the timbered most rapid growth
 and there is every regions and takes a northerly bend a indication that it will show still more couple of
 miles southwest of the station rapid growth next season the country it is between one and two hundred feet around
 wetaskiwin seems to be most wide at low water and becomes very favored by people from the states of large
 in high water this river falls idaho and washington who have gone into the saskatchewan at battleford over and are
 going there in large numbers 14 a riel rebellion diary edited by iris allan the following are excerpts from the

 at present about twenty lodges of half breeds encamped in the vicinity of the fort who i believe intend settling

 the present there are also a large number of piegan indians about and we expect a large arrival of coutenays
 kootenays in a day or two i fancy there will be about three or four thousand of the latter these
 two tribes have been at variance for a long time and i believe it is their intention of taking the
 police as a medium to make peace with one another and thus put an end to th eir ancient enmity
 i hope they will succeed in their good endeavours we have rain nearly every day now and had a very
 severe storm on the 13 th instance which brought vividly back to the recollection of us all that fearful storm
 which we encountered at dufferin last summer and which resulted in our great horse stampede there is not much doing
 in the whiskey line now so we have chiefly only to perform our routine of drill guard etc the country
 is looking finely at present the scenery with the rugged rocky mountains in close proximity is picturesque and grand to
 an extraordinary extent our men are contented and happy now and show a good contract to what they were last
 winter and no one took a greater interest in the welfare of his men than col macleod our assistant commander
