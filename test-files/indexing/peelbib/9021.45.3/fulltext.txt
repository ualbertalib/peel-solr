 association the weak point of knew there already existed the historical allowing confusion between a society of alberta and the
 southern historical society and an old timers alberta pioneers old timers society is that very few indeed of association the

 the history of 1919 member edward higinbotham the west calgary is peculiarly recommended that associate societies liable to a substitution
 of roving or groups should be formed throughout reminiscences for plain historical alberta ‘ however no steps were taken accuracy
 and it has resulted in a want to admit chapters or affiliated groups of proper proportion when dealing and despite

 that a calgary group would organization separate from the old opt for an independent society rather timers group few would

 the rivalry between edmonton and calgary and the division between an historical society and an old timers association were not
 the only fissures by 1926 the romance with the canadian historical association headquartered in ottawa was definitely over a theme
 which was to become more familiar as the years progressed emerged in a letter wallace wrote to the editor of
 the canadian historical review my general conclusion is that if the east will not line itself up as a teammate
 with the west then the west will take the lead and will drag the east in a way it may
 not like therefore i say the review in its field should commence right now and encourage western writers it does
 not seem to me to have done much in that line the eastern writers seem slow to realize the existence
 of western canada in the field of historical writing we know rather more than we are given credit for there
 has been too much in the past of eastern writers writing on western subjects as a kind of side issue
 when they are not otherwise occupied it takes a western resident to write on work although membership at one time
 exceeded sixty a small group of committed individuals who were friends colleagues and business associates were ultimately responsible for the
 society s major achievements these were busy professionals who might simply have grown weary of the effort required to sustain
 an active historical society changes in their personal lives could also have been a factor in 1924 harry pollard began
 extensive travels abroad with his appointment as press photographer for associated screen news and the canadian pacific railway macleod established
 a new partnership macleod edmanson in 1925 by 1926 wallace was working in ontario and davidson had sold the albertan
 and went travelling abroad pearce was nearly eighty years old when he became president that year and by 1930 had
 died coutts and burroughs sold their legal publishing firm to carswell publishing of toronto in 1927 and that same year
 h p o savary died there was never an expectation that the society would attract a large audience or sustain
 widespread support in the menta only at tidewater on the shorea at the bay or at ‘ the ntouihs of

 there was little likelihood of a stampede the executive council reported in 1924 that it is not to be expected
 that a society such as this will have a very general appeal but we believe that the interest which has
 been shown is proof that there is a place for the society in the community 24 by i 927 it
 appears that there was not the lasting legacy of the society was its role in consolidating the talents and energies
 of an exceptional group of individuals who were devoted to the country each of them helped to define in their
 personal and professional lives long after the society ceased to meet davidson coutts macleod pearce and other members continued the

 1997 costing about 20 a month and no transportation to pay for theme were no roads for many years we
 all managed fairly well one day in 1928 a number of us were persuaded by ray jones the station master
 that we should learn to ski he was the owner of five or six pairs of skis and a few
 pairs of bamboo poles as novices we practised on a steep hill behind the mountain park cemetery if we went
 right through the cemetery dodging a few tombstones here and there we had a much longer run there was a
 wooden fence around the graveyard but luckily it was in line with our run and there was an open gate

 many other places teachers had an assured salary of 90 to 100 per month which was a little less than
 most of the miners and coal company staff made with light and water and rent alberta history summer 1997 about
 five feet wide as long as we sturdy leather ski boots with a groove in steered ourselves correctly we would
 the heel to hold the harness joyfully hurtle through the gate at a terrifying speed if our skis swerved our
 far from fashionable ski clothes which was not unusual we would try to were usually sweaters jackets and stop suddenly
 and fall down before we overalls now known as jeans to keep hit the fence or a tombstone during that
 out the snow we pulled men s socks up first year it was a miracle that none of us to
 our knees we looked much like broke any bones but we certainly had a cross country skiers of today black
 and blue winter we used our single pair of skis for all there weren t enough poles for all of
 us types of skiing we had to cross country but ray our instructor soon solved that ski to get to
 the foot of the mountain problem he would get in the middle then strain every muscle to reach the with
 a girl on each side holding a pole desired height and finally to swoop or a girl would get in
 the middle with straight down at a breathtaking pace skiers on either side holding poles then from the top of
 that steep hill dodging a in the early i 930 s an effort was made to stump here and there
 we would whiz build a road to connect the three towns down a la troika we usually managed of mountain
 park cadomin and luscar to slow down just before reaching the although the roads were barely narrow gate but occasionally
 one of the passable especially in winter we spent girls would go screeching through some hilarious weekends skijoring doing her
 best to avoid a collision with which means skiing behind a horse one of the tombstones instead of being pulled
 behind a horse we were towed along by one of the few among those intrepid young skiers were cars on
 the coal branch at that time ben farnham dugald arbuckle nora this car was an impressive new pontiac and peter
 melling peggy semple alice driven inexpertly and dangerously by its and vie riendeau maud beardsley proud owner vie riendeau we
 were dorothy foster les gibeault fanny dragged up hill and down dale by this cuthbertson kathy arbuckle and many slow
 moving car more our favourite jaunt was five miles as we improved we climbed higher and down the track as
 far as the canyon on higher up the mountain and tackled the mcleod river we risked our lives more and
 more difficult and dangerous constantly because on the downhill runs climbing part way up a mountain parts of the road
 our skis acted on skis required a great deal of erratically and we would often be going determination and considerable
 physical faster than the car but oh it was strength with a lot of slip sliding exciting and being young
 we knew we puffing and groaning we often spent a led charmed lives long time getting up to the desired
 height the really thrilling part was of another favourite outing was to plan a course zooming straight down in ski
 picnic we would set off on a minutes often missing trees by a hair s brilliant sunny morning and ski
 through breath pine and spruce trees on a forestry trail toward the cardinal divide in the valley by this time
 we had our own equipment the going was easy but as we neared the bought by mail order from eaton
 s divide we had to gradually start catalogue the skis were seven or eight climbing we had to inch our
 way up feet long and about four inches wide slipping sliding falling and gasping our first harnesses were more like
 gasping because at a height of nearly leather straps but later we graduated to 7 000 feet coupled with the

 while remaining on skis because of the deep snow we would take off our back packs and enjoy sandwiches and
 a hot drink once i foolishly stepped out of my skis and immediately sank to my armpits my friends still
 on skis found that pulling me out was no easy task getting me back on my own skis was quite
 a problem too for many people those were tough depression years but for us even though isolated in a small
 mining town they really were the good old days looking back now i wonder how we could have cheerfully put
 up with all the inconveniences city friends considered us extremely disadvantaged they had hot and cold running water bathrooms central
 heating and many had cars but we living in the isolated 6 000 feet high town of mountain park had
 none of these we had to put up with coal and wood stoves outdoor toilets and no pavements it s
 true we couldn t turn on the taps but the water delivered twice a week was clean and sparkling from
 the headwaters of the mcleod river and on the positive side we had the advantages of youth good health and

 the threat that foreign control of the oil industry might pose 6 until 1953 the u s government worked directly

 eisenhower that crude oil imports were voluntary programs were defended on partners especially because they threatening national security national security
 grounds the reversal in contradicted the american policy of u s policy toward canadian oil in the encouraging freer multilateral
 trade the eisenhower established a special second program cannot be explained on reciprocal trade agreements extension committee chaired by the
 secretary of these grounds it would be impossible to act passed by congress in june 1955 commerce to investigate in
 its july identify factors that in two years had offered a convenient if unconvincing report the committee claimed to have
 changed the status of canadian oil justification for protectionist policies considered but rejected several potential supplies from essential to american

 threat to act the byrd millikin amendment national security concerns one option its national security the national gave the president
 broad discretionary would actually have increased imports to security argument was a less convincing powers to override the terms of
 conserve domestic oil supplies but the justification for the second program than multilateral trade agreements that the committee recommended a
 more formal it had been for the first but it remained act was implementing yet voluntary system of restrictions 8
 an important facade alberta history summer 1997 neither however can the changes in policy toward canadian oil be explained by
 the corporatist interpretation canadian oil was a very minor threat to the u s oil industry in 1957 just as
 it had been in 1955 imports from canada had increased during the first voluntary program but they still accounted for
 only a small portion of u s imports additionally canadian oil while produced more cheaply than u s oil was
 much more expensive than was venezuelan or middle east oil finally the canadian oil industry was regulated much as the
 u s industry was clearly canadian oil was not the main focus of u s import controls rather the apparent
 reversal in u s policy towards canadian oil was tied to international relations concerns the first voluntary program which excluded
 lack of an exemption particularly construction oftrans mountain pipe line canada and venezuela could be considering the bilateral agreements through
 the yellowhead pass in 1952 defended on national security grounds between the countries but perhaps it but had failed to
 protect the domestic believed that when canadians realized industry from the tide of venezuelan that the u s policy had
 little impact on to 51 of capacity in 1957 overall imports furthermore the exemptions them they would come to accept

 the northern slope of what is now pump return journey during the school year calgary and reached by a gravel
 hill it was a wonderful place to keep behind the school stood a stable whei e horses and dogs even
 better being so some of the more fortunate farm kids highway far from town the land was relatively hitched their
 horses ross never owned a cheap horse when they built there about six other the buchanans were poor the only
 homes hid in the groves of poplar as item resembling anything of affluence neighbours most i believe had modern was
 a model t fom d which i never saw amenities such as electricity gas or oil on the road their
 home consisted of heating and telephones it is the one three rooms a kitchen and two home which had none
 of these bedrooms the kitchen also doubled as conveniences which i remember best the living and furnace room as itcontained

 hill below the tree line and commanded and heating the house beside the sink a sweeping view of the sarcee

 luxury any larger than 20 x 20 feet in total size as she no longer had to go outside to
 alberta history summer 1997 pump her water the unpainted walls were clapboard thin in the winter moving from the warm
 kitchen to ross s bedroom was like falling into a snowbank ablutions were done by pouring hot water from the
 kettle into an enamel basin the call of nature was satisfied by tramping nearly a hundred feet or so to
 a drafty privy i can remember this primitive structure particularly well as one christmas night around 1940 1 was invited
 to share the b uchanans christmas dinner unfortunately for me this was the same time as some pernicious bugs decided
 my innards were a choice place to reside the result was a severe case of diarrhea no less than six
 miserable trips were made to that frigid privy through a shrieking blizzard with the thermometer sinking to minus 40 degrees
 stinging ice crystals slashed my face the wind screamed over the crest of the hill as i struggled half blinded
 through the blackness of that awful night things were not much better within the privy itself cracks and knotholes tunnelled
 streams of ice laden winds on any unfortunate occupant the roughhewn seat was covered with powdered snow the only thing
 to recommend the biting cold was the fact that any buttocks instantly became numb and devoid of feeling the only
 furnishing if it can be referred to as that was a ripped eaton s catalogue sometimes when a little crisis
 arises such as a telephone out of order or a power outage it does me good to let my mind
 drift back to the buchanans lot no electricity no gas no transportation nor bath nor shower their survival in fact
 dependent at times such as that christmas night long ago upon the fast burning poplar in that old stove of
 theirs ross i remember was a crack shot he owned a cheap single shot 22 rifle which he used exclusively
 to supplement his family s income lying on a hummock he watched for a gopher to poke its head above
 ground inevitably with one shot the unfortunate creature even by tile 1950 s as this map shows would be killed

 the historical society of alberta came when i realized many of the familiar sights in my life had been historic
 my first few years had been spent in coutts not far from where the whoop up trail crossed the international
 border my youth on a mixed farm in the taber district named after the ‘ cy ranch and my adult
 life in a coaldale home within feet of the north west coal navigation company s railroad right of way the
 prairie about me reeked of history somebody had to gather the stories to tell to my new baby daughter so
 i joined the lethbridge historical society it woke me up to the practise of looking at history globally with an
 eye to one s own locality it also allowed me contacts and friendship with historically minded folks the most interesting
 and honest people i have ever met it also assisted me in the preservation of history through alberta history history
