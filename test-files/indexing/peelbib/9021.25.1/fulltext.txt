 november 30 1886 an historic site the old bulletin building is being torn down and removed this building was long
 a prominent land mark in edmonton but had outlived its usefulness and become an eyesore it was the first business
 building erected in edmonton outside the h b post and was completed in december of 1878 it was used by
 the present proprietor as a store until 1884 the first issue of the bulletin was printed in it in october
 1880 from april 1884 to october 1894 it was the home of the bulletin which finally outgrew it and was
 compelled to seek more roomy and comfortable quarters the present office is erected on the original site of the old
 building which was removed a year ago to make room for it no tears are being shed over its disappearance
 nor is there any intention of preserving it as a monument or in rememberance of the past it served its
 purpose well in its day and now that its day is over the sooner it disappears to make way for
 the necessities of the present and future the better and the more to the credit of all concerned in it
 those who have considered it an eyesore for the past year or two will be surprised to learn that it
 was considered rather a smart building and somewhat in advance of the times when it was erected being the first
 building in the country to sport l 0 xl 2 glass in its windows the regular size of glass in
 the country previously being 7 ½ by 8 ½ the lumber in it was from the first season s custom

 1895 24 tom draper oil sands pioneer by d j comfort early attempts to extract bitumen from the oil sands
 around fort mcmurray have gained some prominence through their perseverance and determination one of these was max ball s extraction
 project the abasand oils pilot plant situated in the horse river valley three miles from fort mcmurray a second was
 the ill fated programme of bob fitzsimmons at his international ‘ ‘ bitumen company plant some 60 miles downstream from
 fort mcmurray there was a third attempt this one made by tom draper a man who clearly had enough perseverence
 to take shovel in hand and build himself an extraction plant before turning to another process the mining and shipping
 of the raw sands historically draper s work has been sharply segregated from extraction processes in that his became a
 mining and paving operation but like fitzsimmons and ball he started out with the dream of building an extraction plant
 his operations marked a turning point in the history of the development of the athabasca oil sands the period when
 it seemed about the only use there might be for the sands was in paving programs for western canada after
 his small extraction plant was wiped out by tom draper with his gerry fire and likely after discovering his extraction
 process was not commercially feasible two of his sons thomas and james re draper following the work of sid ells
 organized the company into the draper elected to throw his energies into the use manufacturing company of port huron of
 the sands for paving max ball and fitz michigan simmons on the other hand continued the the first member of
 the draper family search for a commercially feasible extrac to homestead in alberta was walter h tion process draper a
 brother of tom a civil engineer petrolia ontario was the family base he graduated from the university of alwhere tom

 but painfully he did to canada in 1919 and in 1922 he filed eventually arrive at a similar conclusion a
 homestead patent in edmonton with sam in january of 1921 less than six months kushner a pioneer merchant of mcmurray
 after he had visited mcmurray he wrote as witness the homestead became walter the federal government that he had develop
 draper s permanent residence in 1921 ed a plan for the extraction of oil not only walter s sister jane

 in 1954 samples of oil sand sent to him by the she had obtained the petroleum rights on university of
 alberta torn draper wanted the same section of land held by walter a lease and a chance to operate a
 plant in in a petroleum lease mcmurray it was only natural that the drapers of at the time the alberta
 government was alberta should keep their brothers in ont actively encouraging its own pioneer atario informed of the tar sand
 deposits and tempts to extract the oil from the bituminthe drilling activity around mcmurray tom ous sands hoping to find
 a process by draper was invited out to the homestead which they could be commercially treated and in the summer
 of 1920 he visited his a major portion of the petroleum leases brother and sister in alberta this was his

 was not without his father s inventive spirit of both the alberta government and the from that point on tom
 began to channel university of alberta experiments as a his energies towards the commercial poten result tom draper was informed
 of the tial of one of canada s greatest curiosities current restrictions to tar sand rights in in november of
 that year he started the northern alberta and that his application first of a continuing series of letters to the
 was set aside federal government requesting information draper was not easily turned down he on the oil sand deposits around
 mcmurray contacted some friends in the house of he was inundated with an overwhelming commons had them over to view
 his cxamount of literature in reply sidney ells traction plant operations and through them had been sent to the mcmurray
 district in passed the word along that he had met with 1913 to investigate the tar sand exposures success 1
 he had a process for extracting in his subsequent reports ells chief con the oil from the sands and from
 200 pounds elusion was that the oil sand potential lay of tar sand he had produced over two in paving
 programs for western canada gallons of oil draper stated he would be with this information the bituminous sand pleased to
 provide a demonstration in otschemes took on a new tack and veered tawa should he be considered for obtaining sharply
 towards paving enterprises the a lease the university of alberta immedioutright sale of land including the mineral ately extended an
 invitation to draper to deposits in the bituminous sand regions come to edmonton and use its laboratories had been withdrawn
 but leases could still and engineering facilities in the developbe had on a yearly rental basis of 50 cents ment
 of his oil extraction process this per acre by 1920 the entire area was offer was refused placed under reserve
 and a lessee had to with persistence draper was eventually prove that he had a process for extracting granted a
 lease from brother walter and oil from the sand ells in the meantime his wife lenore tom obtained a transfer
 26 the use of tar sands for paving purposes was the subject for several experiments this particular section was laid
 in edmonton of their rights obtained through their home ran into constant trouble and as if there stead sister jane
 also transferred her petro were not enough problems he took an inleum lease rights in addition draper was stant dislike
 to sid ells who draper comallowed to lease some land from the school plained had an officious and arrogant mandivision
 and was granted surface rights to ncr another problem occurred when his some land patented to the alberta and first
 plant burned down in the summer of great waterways railway on the 16 th of 1924 after having been in
 operation experi october 1922 tar sand lease no 20 was mentally for only a very short time the issued in
 his favor it comprised 1 603 extraction plant was rebuilt in the fall and acres of dominion lands and a
 further lease winter and by the summer of 1925 active of 320 acres of school lands the lessee operations on
 the site said draper were was required to construct within 18 months in progress he described the plant as conan
 extraction or treatment plant at a mini sisting of retorts boiler engine pump and mum cost of s 30 000
 which would operate other standard machinery it was perhaps continuously for at least six months of within this period of
 time that draper was every year thinking about mining and shipping the in that same year draper formed the raw
 sands in any event a relatively large mcmurray asphaltum and oil ltd which quantity of sand was mined and shipped
 was incorporated and backed by american on the alberta and great waterways railcapital from the beginning draper seemed way according

 were supposed to have he d dump the tar sands in and he fired been processed for oil was the
 same amount it with tar sands too that had been sold by draper to dr k a it was clear
 to the authorities that some clark of the research council of alberta thing had to be done with toni draper
 they had certainly been processed but not obviously his lease was subject to cancelby draper lation by the terms of
 the existing regula during this time draper turned to active tions the lessee had to operate a treatment ly mining
