 as tough and strict money in 1912 to refurbish the old isolation hos the san at frank needed a director
 who would pital across the street from the calgary general stand for no nonsense the building itself was the city
 provided utilities the small hospital simply the old cpr hotel converted at the held 12 beds indoors and two on
 the porch while expense of the dscr and open in the fall of 1917 baker had his problems running this
 track that would allow him or her to deal sueinstitution firstly there was government red cessfully with the remissions and
 recurrences of tape reams of it he was in constant contact chronic disease baker firmly agreed with this with his
 superior in calgary regarding every function when questioned as to the advisability thing from cooks to scrub brushes secondly of
 re admitting a man who had already had san there were the limitations of frank itself the care some years
 before baker replied that stores were broken into and many items of cloth except for a rest there was not
 much to be gained ing were stolen the robbers escaping into the by re admission mountain country surrounding the town
 well as regards sanatorium treatment my opinion trained staff were hard to keep perhaps most is that provided a man
 knows how to take care of irritating the town was so small that when baker himself there is no advantage
 in sending him to an married in ea rly 1920 his bride had to move into institution whose function primarily
 is one of his quarters in the sanatorium no other rooms instruction being available thirdly there were problems of disciplinary
 problems then arose simply discipline these partly stemmed from the fact because a sanatorium was a place of discipline that
 all the inmates were young ex soldiers hopefully of self discipline inmates were some of whom had pensions as large
 as 60 a people feeling not too ill who were supposed to month with little to spend this on but
 alcohol be learning how to improve their physical condi but part of baker s problem was based in the tion
 and keep it improved had the ex soldiers at fact that the frank san was after all a sanator frank
 been feeling worse as sick as those ium not a hospital baker himself had been an housed in the civilian
 tb hospitals in calgary it inmate at the prototype of all north american would have been much easier to keep
 them in sanatona dr e l trudeau s establishment line as it was they had more tha n enough at

 adequate rest bored activities were arranged for their diverplenty of fresh air and as much exercise as one s sion
 vocational training pen pals croquet and constitution could bear while care for the very miniature golf even a visit from
 the california sick was available the facility was basically movie girls co 3 this basic problem of meant to set
 the moderately ill tubercular on a entertaining long term patients was to follow baker to the new san being built
 at robertson or with dust bed spreads are the same such a condi keith just outside calgary pleading a well
 don of affairs is novelfor a certain length of time but at the present time it is not only injurious
 to the men s justified disgust with government red tape the health but it has a most injurious effect on
 their frame superintendent made a half hearted attempt to of mind personally i do not blame anyonefor asking find work
 in medicine hat but when the time for a transfer from this place at the present time ca me for
 the opening of the new institution not since these dust storms are almost unbearable i would ask therefore that steps
 be taken to get some only baker but many of the frank medical and solution of this bare ground problem
 domestic staff and 52 soldiers mostly from grass and trees were necessary not just to hold frank but some from
 wetaskiwin moved in 4 the soil outdoor activity was a basic tenet of the the central alberta sanatorium hereinafter sanatoruim
 philosophy attractive grounds were referred to as cas was the only san in canada required to keep up morale a
 full time gardener newly built to provide facilities for the on going was hired and eventually the cas could boast
 care of tubercular veterans of world war one in 1750 trees spruce douglas fir larch oak all other provinces the
 dscr simply paid for birch maple and flowering shrubs 2 many of extensions to existing civilian sanatoria it is these
 still stand today some of the many flower probable that alberta received this boon partly gardens are also maintained because
 the minister of the department was sen but the most serious inadequacies baker had to ator james a lougheed of
 calgary however it deal with were ones planned into the project from is also probable that southern alberta s need
 for the sta rt what the province and the dscr had such an institution was taken into account in built
 was a sanatorium only cases expected to 1919 representatives of the provincial and benefit from the relaxed san regime were
 to be federal governments signed an agreement to admitted advanced cases were to be cared for in spend 200 000
 each on the project the sa n the various hospitals receiving provincial grants provided 100 beds for soldiers and 75
 for the impossibility of such a division soon became civilians and was to be administered by the apparent not only
 were the hospitals unhappy federal government for five years at which time just as the calgary general had been 20
 yea rs administration was to be transferred to the before to have extremely infectious tuberculars provincial health department which in
 turn in their institutions but there simply was not would guarantee care of veterans at cost 5 enough room within
 a year of the san s opening the location chosen was a piece of land along baker had to abandon
 his own stubborn adherthe bow river directly opposite bowness park ence to the sanatorium method of treatment and the sanatorium
 consisted of four pavilions di beg for more infirmary beds such accommodavided into wards of eight beds each one infirm

 around this shortage ed to be the most up to date and best equipped in might be to heat the
 pavilions one of the more canada 6 however the physical plant was not heroic medical methods of treating pulmonary without
 its problems for one thing the front tb was to have patients sleep in full fresh air doors of all
 the buildings faced the river and they even in the dead of winter therefore built as it were soon abandoned
 for the more accessible was according to au courant institutional back doors 7 for another the institution was arguments the
 cas was purposely deprived of situated on treeless grassless grounds 8 any means by which to heat its pavilions the
 despite the fact that an attempt was made at the buildings meant to house those who were there time of
 construction to seed grass the grounds mainly to build up their stamina this adulation were still barren after the cas
 opened this for the benefits of icy air would shortly go out of plus calgary s heavy winds led to
 unpleasa nt style but calgary s arctic temperatures caused conditions during one storm baker could not baker to seek its
 premature abandonment at the restrain himself from writing a piqued letter to cas pavilion patients wore bed socks sleeping his
 superior in the dscr once a week he com caps and dressing gowns to bed they used one or plained
 the dust was so thick one could not see two stone hot water bottles each they piled on six one
 building from another the pavilions and the or seven blankets topped off by their sheep skin infirmary were filled with
 dust and the floors coats they closed all the windows thereby exwere black with it eluding the fresh air that
 really helped in their the patients both in the infirmary and in the recover y and worst of all as
 soon as the nurse pavilions waken with their faces absolutely covered had finished her final rounds they dragged their bed

 did so order to keep or attract medical staff however a poorly under these conditions that he was forced separate
 children s pavilion was late in coming to move them into the overtaxed infirmary 2 demands fora surgical unit went
 long unheeded the cas got heat for its pavilions but this was nurses and domestic staff lived in unhealthily not
 enough to take the pressure off the infirmary crowded conditions till after world war two in 1922 one pavilion was
 revamped to provide and space for patients never grew past the 32 infirmar y beds by 1925 only one pavilion
 maximum of 210 beds reached in 1929 25 the was left for strictly mbula nt cases and still more cas
 began to report a waiting list in 1926 by infirmary beds were needed 22 by the end of the 1933
 the average wait for a bed was 41 days decade baker was forced to admit that it was the longest
 wait was 92 days nine applica nts apparent that in this province the sanatorium is died before a bed was
 available there was a but a hospital 23 here were simply too pressing need for more accommodation alberta many albertans
 very sick with tb to allow the shared with british columbia the dubious hononly sizable tuberculosis institution in the our
 of being the only provinces in which the tb province to concentrate on a mbulant care rate had climbed over
 the previous nine years matters were not to improve shortly in 1934 80 authorities considered the minimum acconimoper cent of
 cas patient days were spent in the dation required for any population to be one tb infirmaries 24 bed for
 every annual tb death to achieve this alberta needed 180 more beds 26 the unaccom considered deportation of long time
 residents modated sick were not only unfortunate but rather than pay for extended san care on june 1 dangerous 1936
 the pmblem was solved when alberta in view of the length of time patients requiring sana became the second province

 of infection to other members of the family and to the community this is the most serious provincial expense for
 all residents suffering public health problemfacing us today 27 from tuberculosis of the lungs given the lack of space and
 the fear of infec limited though it was to pulmonary patients tion it is obvious that the cas had little
 choice the new act mea nt even more demnd for tb but to concentrate on the most infectious form of

 therefore been taking some tb patients before passage of while all phases of tb were admitted preference he act and
 general would have even more beds was given to those with pulmonary tb and set aside within two years the
 result was that among these preference to the most infectious alberta soon had space for 342 patients rather the province

 perhaps it was the same person chance of gaining entry to the cas or the edmon who also came down
 the dumb waiter to raid the ton hospitals the argument against coverage of ice box this too was given additional
 fastsuch people was that they were not grossly infec ening tious and therefore not a threat to the community it
 is possible also that the raider or raiders however baker pointed out the injustice of this were moved to action

 a comprehensive campaign to conquer this disease on the way to recovery they were not recovered requires that attention be
 given wherever the disease fully many months of sanatorium living lay appears to trace down as quickly as possible the
 ahead for even the most resourceful the period spreaders of disease and for this reason as long as of slow
 mending could be infinitely tedious for the non pulmonary cases do not come within the one thing the cas was
 isolated from the city of scope of the work of this division so long are we out of touch with
 a type of tuberculosis that accountedfor calgary such isolation was true of most 24 of the tuberculosis deaths last year
 sanatoria populations feared spread of infection if tuberculars were within anything for the tubercular lucky enough to gain a berth
 approaching breathing distance however the at the cas the treatment was in accordance with cas was particularly isolated while not
 far the best methods available at the time during really from calgary and very close to the end of the
 first decade the basic aim was to build the the streetca r line at the gates of bowness prk it
 body up so that it could fight the disease this was cut off by the bow river one of the
 first things baker asked for was a footbridge across some attempted to numb the passage of time the river lacking
 such a bridge the only ways through the consumption of smuggled alcohol but to get to town were to walk
 along the railroad this activity discouraged not only because grade to catch the 13 30 train at the nearby drinking

 problems in provisioning upper the san paper started in 1936 and meant to and in keeping staff during pe riods
 of high em provide information and amusement for patients p loyment it caused inconvenience for visitors in calgar y and

 in later years was that ta king correspondence courses 62 for those inter people leaving the san had not only
 been depleted ested in working with their hands there was by tuberculosis but had been debilitated by one of occupational
 therapy some patients had always the new surgical techniques used to save lives done handicrafts women in particular spending the
 medical staff at the cas had always used long hours on prize winning needlework but it the most modern forms
 of treatment available was not until 1943 that the alberta tuberculosis upon admittance the new patient was subjected association took

 the tubercular so that the disease could be cas baker had early started a policy of using the thrown off
 particular attention was paid to services of ambulant patients in short shifts in dental condition poor teeth meant poor nutrition
 positions requiring little physical labour as early which meant poor health at first patients were as 1924 he employed three
 patients part time to sent in to calgary for subsidized dental care but replace one full time telephone operator this
 by the mid l 920 s a dentist ca me monthly to practice continued one patient who started on perform
 all medical procedures free except for the switchboard in 1951 switched to the labora bridgework and the fitting of dentures
 which activities at the central alberta sanitorium near calgary included events such as this hallowe en party in 1930 both
 patients and staff participated in the entertainment were performed at a nominal charge 68 great education concentrated on good diet
 plenty of care was taken to halt spread of tuberculosis to rest and care in handling infected materials the staff
 to visitors a nd to other patients however at the same time medical technology nurses had an unusually high tuberculosis
 rate was working towards a day when aggressive compared to doctors who frequently came into attack would surpass passive resistance
 in the tb work as a result of successfully combatting fight against tb the disease on a personal level both
 baker and leslie mullen a later medical superintendent at by 1940 the director of tuberculosis control in the cas had
 had tb nurses who caught the alberta declared that the days of the rest dietetic disease saw their careers ended
 by it the cas regime were past 73 he must have had little idea had its quota of these women

 therapy rest was the watchword of more healthy accommodation for them and set tb treatment in order to rest an
 infected lung it up strict rules for the avoidance of infection was necessar y to collapse it one of the
 earliest similar rules applied to other staff particularly methods of doing this was to inject the pleural those involved in
 food handling all were exa cavity with nitrogen gas this method had been mined before their appointments were made per

 throughout the province where released months and leaves were longer than in most patients could go for a refill while
 pneumothorhospitals so that employees could get completely ax was a temporary measure there were two away from contagion 7 the
 patients were also other ways to collapse a useless lung thoracoexpected to do all they could to prevent spread of

 the town and its graphs were sold to anyone wishing to send them to friends and relatives as evtdence that
 they now surrounding area was enjoying a boom the great resided in a city with modern amenities prairie land boom
 hundreds of people were arriving he country was filling up and these were heady years the great land boom edmonton

 history of the west but he him at this time sold prints to schools and individuals he also in spite
 of these setbacks brown continued prepared slide sets for classroom use the slides the fight to recover his property it

 its history from 1905 to 1914 as such been unfairly treated by not only his creditors but brown was part
 of the later phase of the pioneer society in general this presumably led to his era and in recording speed
 was of the essence developing a socialist outlook and a desire to see with brown whose rule was to aim
 and shoot at what he considered a just society the same time he collected photographs and brown was over sensitive
 about being given artifacts of the period many photographs in the credit for his photographs when these were used collection
 were not taken by him or his preby others and was always incensed at what he decessors but by others

 june 4 and they served a tr y won t sta rt growing there if aberhart makes his the solution
 proposed by william aberhart in ‘ book keeping revolution to give to the his version of the social credit theories
 of major poor aberhart would have to take from the c h douglas looked deceptively easy the rich problem he
 said was the people didn t get back in the mining communities in the drumheller area gave considerable support to
 the communist candidate in 1935 but the social crediters won a sweeping victory above is the mine and community at
 rosedale the form of salaries profits or other income farmers and small business people on the term enough money to
 buy back the goods that were just pr ice didn t coincide with that of its produced the solution was
 to issue credit in the originator major c h douglas but so what form of basic dividends to the amount
 of 25 a just price represented what the people wa nted month to make up this difference aberhart said that
 a just price would not only it was not necessar y aberhart said to take be placed on all goods
 and services but that regufrom the rich to give to the poor it wasn t neces lations would be imposed
 to prevent excessive sary to socialize the economy profits would not price spreads between the cost and selling price of
 be interfered with it wasn t necessary for people goods to prevent as the blue manual of social to engage
 in strikes demonstrations and hunger credit explained wildcat exploitation of the marches as advocated by he communists all consumer through
 the medium of enormously exthey had to do was to ma rk their ballots for social cessive price spreads in
 price for the purpose of credit on election day and all the social credit paying high dividends on pyramids of
 watered government had to do was to print more money stock that too sounded good to the average in the
 form of basic dividends and we would be consumer who readily accepted that the wealth of on the way to
 prosperity once more the country was being manipulated as the blue the promise to give everybody 25 a month manual
 also charged by one or more men was combined with another promise that of a known as the ‘ fifty
 big shots of canada just price this sounded good to farmers who of course we communists and others asked were
 being squeezed by the banks and implement where the money would come from to pay basic companies and who too
 often sold at prices below dividends aberhart declared that they would be the cost of production it also sounded good
 to backed by the natural resources of the province small business men who were having a difficult which were the
 cultural heritage of all the time staying afloat at a time of depressed prices people furthermore they would be backed
 by and low demand the interpretation placed by and come out of an unearned increment fund this in turn was
 defined as the increase in the 1935 it looked positively dangerous to the price of goods which is not earned
 by the owner or guardians of big business producer but which comes about for example by in the self critical
 discussions which followincreased demand ed the elections the communist party recogniz this sounded okay to people too ed that in
 calling the social credit movement aberhart never precisely defined how social semi fascist its policies had been not only credit
 would be implemented his explanations sectarian but incorrect were usually in the most general terms when for us it was
 a case of not being able to see the pressed to the wall by people well versed in forest for
 the trees we recognized of course economics he always replied that the implemen that social credit was supported by a
 large mass tation of social credit could be left to the of people seeking what appeared to them an easy
 experts who would be hired by a social way out of the devastating economic crisis that credit government aberhart didn
 t so much had engulfed us all but in our thinking this took capture the minds of the people as
 he did their second place to another feature we saw in the feelings and longings social credit movement its anti
 semitism this what also worked in aberhart s favor was that was the 1 930 s hitler was in power
 in germany he attacked those recognized by the people as persecuting the jewish people a nd anti semitheir enemies and
 was in turn attacked by them tism was a central feature of the fascist move it is doubtful if any
 political party in canada ment certainly not in alberta outside of the commun anti semitism was in our view an
 inherent part ist party was ever attacked as fiercely and of the douglas theories of social credit far from viciously
 as social credit was by the establish being a secret this was one of its most widely ment of the
 day comparing aberhart to hitler publicized planks douglas and his followers and mussolini was one of the milder forms of
 blamed not only the bankers and financial interattack on social credit and on aberhart person ests for the world s
 ills they claimed that jewish ally bankers controlled international finance and that but the attacks by big business by the
 press the economic depression was a esult of if not and radio they owned and the politicians who caused by
 a plot of jewish bankers represented them did not hurt social credit i can recall the anit semetic tinge to
 the study these were the forces that many albertans per outlines that were circulated in social credit ceived as responsible
 for the economic depres study groups whether they were aberhart supsion it appeared as if they were engaged in a
 porters or orthodox douglas groups and there conspiracy against social credit and if they were differences between them i cannot
 say feared and hated it that much it couldn t be all what we communists failed to clearly recogthat bad
 nize in the 1935 campaign was that anti semitism there is little doubt that the establishment did was not the
 most significant feature of aberhart s fear and hate social credit social credit movement even if anti semitism was covertly
 or openly espoused by some of its they feared that if attempts were made to followers i do not recall
 any attacks on jews implement its funny money theories which bankers or others by aberhart or other top leadwere obviously
 unsound the economy and the ers of his social credit movement whole financial system would be disrupted a similarity that
 we saw between social credit they bitterly resented the attacks by social and fascist movements superficial though it may credit
 on them as the ones responsible for the have been was that both attacked the bankers and economic distress that
 faced the people financial interests and both attacked the socialist finally they were concerned over the direc and communist movements
 tion that social credit might ta ke strange to what we failed to see was that hitler while say some
 even feared it would end up as a corn demagogically attacking jewish bankers munist movement their fears were groundless in
 fact being financed by big german industrial of course because as a middle class movement and financial interests and whereas
 hitler cenbased on a fallacious economic theory with tred his attack on the socialist and communist nowhere to go the
 establishment did not have movements whose combined vote was almost too much trouble in absorbing and directing double that of
 hitler s nazis aberhart while social credit in the years that followed but in not infrequently attacking socialism and corn

 add that it wasn t the alberta is the means by which the bour communists alone who attacked the social

 this was i and our attacks were mild compared to the believe n incorrect assessment attacks by the business owned
 media such as the on the other hand he did emphasize that the calgary herald masses and large numbers of
 progressive anti following the 1935 elections the communist fascist people support this movement because party began intensive inner discussions on
 the they see in it a movement against the banks and nature of social credit the significance of its for
 the raising of purchasing capacity and living election the reasons for it a nd what our attitude standards of the
 masses should be to social credit the national lead in a self critical vein he declared that at the ership
 of our party saw much more clearly the beginning we did not correctly estimate the mass need for a new
 assessment than did our alberta hold of the movement and its anti capitalist leadership in alberta we were still inclined
 to appeal to the masses we limited ouselves to a brand as fascist ever y action of the aberhart scientific
 exposure of the fallacies of the government which we considered reactionary economic theories of aberhart and douglas and the debate
 over a new assessment got under denounced social credit adherants as fascists way at the meeting of the central committee

 to them in the fight for their most im and that some top people in bot h the liberal and

 called the semi hitler while disagreeing in some cases with his fascist plans of aberhart anti semetic atrocities tim buck
 national leader of the party to us the defeat of fascism in the world and in speaking on the subject
 at the meeting ex canada was a paramount issue pressed similar views we can say he said since in the
 view of marxists every political the average farmer and average worker in party represents an economic class in our society
 alberta who voted for social credit did not vote or sections of classes one of the first questions for fascism
 he may have voted for the repre we tackled was what class or classes did social sentative of an incipient
 fascist movement but credit represent he did not believe that the average ordinary we concluded that at this point in
 its developperson in alberta who voted for social credit ment it epresented and was under the leadership voted for a
 change for a new social order of the middle classes of the population small a leader of the party in
 alberta however business people farmers and professional speaking at this meeting persisted in the theme people it was a grass
 roots people protest of social credit being fascist the aberhart movement directed against the banks and mortmovement he charged is
 pregnant with the gage companies big business interests and possibilities of developing into a real fascist particula rly eastern financial
 interests usually movement a movement which we believe has referred to in the west as st james street all the
 possibilities of developing into a real montreal and bay street toronto politically fascist movement in canada it was a revolt
 against the parties that represented this view was sharply rejected by stewart the financial interests the old line parties as
 smith and others in closing the discussion on well as the reform parties the ufa which had he issue smith
 said gone over to the camp of the financial interests the district bureau in alberta can make no and had
 become thoroughly discredited after 14 greater mistake than continue to talk about the social years in office credit party as
 a fascist party it is nor a fascist the communist party tried to find an answer to party inside the
 social credit movement there are fascist elements and reactionary fascist groupings an important question why did people of alberta that
 will attempt to utilize it to direct the mass opt for social credit rather than gravitate towards following of social
 credit into the channels of the ccf as did the people of neighbouring profascism but inside the social credit party
 also and vinces even in the leadership of that party there are a great we concluded there were three main
 reasons many honest reformers who want to carry through reforms who are against fascism who are against many leading socialists
 in alberta men like reaction and who are genuinely convinced that their bill irvine who was associated with labour and
 support to social credit is along the lines and in the leaders of the ufa gave credence and support to
 direction of ‘ socialism our task is to isolate the fascist elements inside the social credit movement monetary reform ideas
 the ufa went so far as to and win over the honest reformers and the masses of bring major douglas
 to alberta in the spring of the people following the aberhart movement on the 1934 to testify before the legislature
 while this basis of developing the widest mass struggle to make was a political move by the ufa government to
 the rich pay in alberta to relieve the masses of the discredit social credit and to show that the ufa
 burdens of the crisis around a broad alberta program for the economic betterment of the great masses was also interested
 in monetary reform it of the people in alberta backfired these hearings including aberhart s these discussions continued in alberta
 for testimony only served to a rouse more interest in many months finally we were able to arrive at a
 social credit as a possible solution to the new and more realistic assessment of the social economic depression credit movement
 a second reason for the social credit victory this great concern that communists had in the was that the ufa
 had become completely dis thirties with fascism and the danger of it arising credited after 14 yea rs in office
 it had been in canada may seem strange to people today it unable to come up with any po licies
 that showed should be remembered that in the thirties many promise of improving the lives of the people and fascist
 movements were active in canada that at it had acted ha rshly against unemployed workers a groundswell of public support
 in 1935 forced the united farmers of alberta completely out of office in favour of social credit above is a
 social credit rally in calgary during the election campaign and hungr y farmers when they organized protest aberhart just as
 it was by the fundamentalists in marches and demonstrations the southern united states the ufa was one of the founding
 groups of aberhart appealed to the people to have faith the ccf in 1932 and 1933 in fact it was
 the base in his politics just as he appealed to them to have of the ccf in alberta discredited as
 the ufa faith in his religion his opponents were labelled had become it was only logical that this would as
 satanic while he modestly claimed that he rub off on the ccf to many people the ufa and social credit
 were only the instruments of was the ccf in office and they wanted no more the lord of it the
 ufa helped to sully the meaning of the aberhart and his fundamentalists were also word socialism in alberta and the
 ccf never conservative in their political outlook it is no recovered from it political accident that in later years so
 many the third reason for social credit s wide social crediters found their way into the consupport was the fact
 that it grew out of a religious servative party movement a nd only became political after it had in the
 scores of bible classes which aberhart established a popular base aberhart his had organized throughout the province directed prophetic bible
 institute and his bible classes by the prophetic bible institute he had a ready were based on religion of a
 fundamentalist and made machine that could and was quickly transevangelist type they accepted the literal en formed into a election
 machine terpretation of the bible that the earth was made in the several years following its election in in seven
 days that ma n was born in sin that the 1935 a showdown developed between the aldevil lurked everywhere seeking
 to lead people berta government and ottawa with one piece of into sin and that sinners would burn in hell
 alberta legislation after another being everlastingly they fiercely rejected all efforts challenged by ottawa and declared invalid of the church
 to adapt its views to the findings of business interests established the people s science the theory of evolution was
 rejected by league to oust aberhart at the same time discontent and impatience developed within the including its mla s
 which included for social credit movement including a large group example communist support for the election of of its mla
 s over the failure to implement orvis kennedy in an edmonton by election in social credit promises and effectively meet
 march 1938 where the victory parade followpeople s needs ing the election included leslie morris western it was in this
 period that close relationships director of the communist party in its front were established between the communist party ranks and
 sections of the social credit movement but that is another story night flight 1931 by bill hay i had the
 pleasure of being the first southbound passenger on the new calgary lethbridge air mail link and can truthfully state that
 it was one of the most pleasant journeys i have yet made under the skillful guidance of pilot hollick kenyon
 the powerful boeing biplane landed in the gla re of the lethbridge airport floodlight in about 57 minutes after the
 take off from calgary airdrome being the lone passenger i was ushered into the front seat of the cabin which
 will accommodate four passengers in comfort my baggage was stowed away in a forward compartment along with the sacks of
 mail the pilot clad in fur lined garments mounted the two steps into the outside cockpit of the idling plane
 the motor was then revved up to an ea r splitting roar which was plainly audible inside the cabin and
 the machine began to move taxi ing to the far end of the calgar y field the boeing was turned
 round and with gathering speed rose off the ground out of the rays of the floodlight over the spectators heads
 a sharp right bank and with the city myriad of twinkling lights fading behind us we were on our way
 one of the first things to attract the attention after leaving calgary is the glare of the gas flares at
 turner valley the night was clear and visibility was good for many miles the ruddy glow of the flames lit
 up the countryside and the reflection played against the wings of the plane towns and farmhouses all along the route
 could be picked out by the lights and flashing off in the distance could be seen the revolving beacons of
 the emergency landing fields in the semi darkness the ground could be seen but it was difficult to determine at
 just what altitude the plane was travelling unless one has travelled the route several times and has a map it
 is impossible to tell which town one is passing over the emergency landing fields are laid out in two directions
 in order that any planes forced to land can do so with the wind in the proper direction the ground
 lights of the field give the pilot the assurance of a good landing and the landing lights on the underside
 of the wings could be switched on to take the place of the floodlights installed at the stopping points the
 air was calm sunday night and the plane speeded along without the least bump or jar the cabin of the
 boeing is most comfortable the leather upholstered seats and the hot air register giving one the impression of sailing along
 in a huge motor boat there is a metal knob on the floor of the plane near the register which
 when opened permits cool air to enter and there is no chance of the cabin becoming too stuffy when nearing
 lethbridge the air appa rently had a few holes in it for the plane bumped around now and then but
 nothing to upset even the most nervous of passengers the flashing beacon of the city port could be seen plainly
 before the lights of lethbridge itself were visible crossing the river the roaring motor was idled down and the landing
 lights flashed as a signal to the ground crew awaiting the plane s a rrival immediately the surrounding countryside was
 illuminated from the city floodlight ever y depression and trail being shown up clearly circling the field and gradually losing
 altitude the pilot brought the huge plane around in a gradual left bank and dropped down to earth without jar
 or bounce in full view of the floodlight the pla ne was taxied to the hangar where passenger and mail
 were delivered all in the remarkably short time of 57 minutes the fly by night experience was interesting and enjoyable
 and as the days go more and more travellers will come to look upon the plane as the only means
 of safe and speedy travel lethbridge herald jan 19 1931 notes and correspondence announcements gave me the particulars concerning this
