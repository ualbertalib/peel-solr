 the patrician 2004 2 vp colonel in chief princess patricia s canadian light infantry message from the colonel in chief 
 the countess mountbatten of burma cbe cd jp dl i am very pleased once again to provide some opening comments 
 for the patrician i am always amazed at the remarkable amount of activity that occurs across the entire spectrum of 
 the regiment and the year 2004 was no exception in fact as the year marked the regiment s 90th anniversary 
 of service it was indeed a year of great activity and excitement i am truly very sorry for not being 
 able to visit my patricias for the 90th anniversary celebrations in winnipeg and edmonton unfortunately my husband s health precluded 
 me from travelling he and i were certainly with all of our patricias in spirit as you celebrated this special 
 day by all accounts the celebrations were remarkable enjoyable and memorable the soldiers of the regiment have a lot to 
 be proud of as the regiment s history is one of selfless service dedication to the nation and professionalism today 
 s patricias have a glorious heritage to live up to and it is clear that today s soldiers are as 
 dedicated skilled and willing to serve as their predecessors i am very proud of all of you the year also 
 marked my 30th year as the regiment s colonel in chief i am so very pleased with my close association 
 with the regiment and its officers and soldiers past and present while lam associated with many fine organizations and causes 
 i hold my relationship with my patricias very dear to my heart it is a special relationship that i greatly 
 cherish i know that this has been a very busy year and that patricias have been engaged on all fronts 
 as well as celebrating the 90th anniversary the second battalion closed down kapyong barracks in winnipeg and moved the unit 
 to shilo i have very fond memories of kapyong barracks in winnipeg as i am certain most soldiers who have 
 served there do the barracks had a real army feel to them and it was always a great pleasure to 
 visit the battalion i am certain that the new kapyong barracks in shilo will develop its own feel and will 
 become a fine home for the battalion i look forward to visiting the battalion on my next trip to canada 
 the year also saw patricias on yet another operational tour this time in afghanistan i am certain that the soldiers 
 deployed performed in the regiment s customary professional manner to all my patricias and their families i want to extend 
 my warmest wishes and regards i look forward to the year ahead and know that all patricias everywhere past and 
 present continue to serve the regiment in grand style 
 3 the patrician 2004 vp colonel of the regiment princess patricia s canadian light infantry message from the colonel of 
 the regiment major general ret d r i stewart cmm cd fellow patricias 2004 was yet another extraordinary year for 
 the regiment we as a regiment were able to come together and celebrate our 90th anniversary in two locations first 
 at kapyong barracks in winnipeg with the second battalion and then in edmonton at our new home station with the 
 first and third battalions it was a time to reflect on our history of accomplishments and to visit with and 
 remember old comrades unfortunately our colonel in chief lady patricia was unable to be with us in person but i 
 can guarantee that she and lord john were with us in spirit my thanks to the association the battalions regimental 
 headquarters and all patricia s who attended for making the 90th anniversary a success the year also saw another significant 
 event after 34 years calling it home the second battalion closed out kapyong barracks and opened the new kapyong barracks 
 in shilo the battalion eagerly embraced this change and the challenges that it presented and conducted the move and transition 
 in true second battalion fashion as your colonel of the regiment i was fortunate this year to visit all three 
 battalions in the field and in garrison as well i visited our new patricias as they underwent training at lfwa 
 training centre the professionalism skill and esprit de corps was evident in all soldiers that i met during these visits 
 in my view the caliber of our soldiers and all levels of leadership remains very high despite the many unique 
 challenges that face soldiering in canada at this time in our history now i would like to turn your thoughts 
 to the future by the time you receive this edition of the patrician we will be just 4 short years 
 away from our 95th anniversary and only 9 years from celebrating our 100 th anniversary planning committees have already commenced 
 preparations for both events in particular serious work has commenced for the very significant 100 th anniversary celebrations this will 
 be for most of us the most important anniversary in our regimental life and will require the enthusiastic involvement of 
 all members of the regimental family if we are to carry it off in the best tradition and style of 
 our regiment it will consist of local national and international events detailed planning for the anniversary is underway and is 
 headed up by bgen ret d vince kennedy initial planning indicates a very ambitious and exciting program you will hear 
 a great deal more about this in the next few years as a regiment we can expect to face many 
 changes and challenges in the years ahead we must meet these with a positive attitude and throughout hold true to 
 our ethos our sense of style and uphold the best traditions of the regiment all the best for continued success 
 and good soldiering to all members of the regimental family 
 the patrician 2004 4 rhq editor s comments message from the regimental major major e a giraldeau cd another year 
 in regimental headquarters has come and gone on the outside looking in one might think that i must be mad 
 to have stayed here for so long that i am now the longest serving rm in regimental history four years 
 and counting as of time of printing however from the inside looking out i must say that this is one 
 of the best regimental tours one could have those of us fortunate enough to serve the regiment from within rhq 
 have a unique perspective of regimental life and what it means to belong to a regimental family like in any 
 family environment we see the good and the bad and i can honestly say that it is mostly good in 
 fact it is getting better day by day week by week as more and more serving and retired soldiers see 
 the benefit of belonging to and supporting the regimental family this renewed support can be seen in many ways the 
 voluntary donations made by serving soldiers to support the charitable activities of the regiment have significantly increased over the past 
 year with this increased support the regiment is able to give back to the soldiers in the way of benevolent 
 assistance to those of the family in need the benevolent fund has given out over 28 000 dollars in assistance 
 grants and loans in the past four years as well the voluntary donations have also allowed the regiment to maintain 
 and enrich the collection of the regimental museum thus helping to preserve the rich heritage of the regiment the renewed 
 support is evident in the manner in which we say goodbye to our members past and present who pass away 
 requests for funeral parties from family members are on the rise an indication that the connection to the regiment of 
 our predecessors is still strong likewise those serving soldiers who participate in the funeral parties often on a voluntary basis 
 have come back from the tasking with a rekindled appreciation of having done the right thing in saying goodbye to 
 our veterans in a deserving respectful and dignified way the association is seeing signs of the renewed support more of 
 the younger soldiers are actively seeking out membership upon release in order to maintain contact with the regiment the recently 
 initiated volunteer patricia programme vpp launched by the association to assist retired members in adjusting to retirement and the changes 
 this brings to their lives is being well received it is a strong reminder to all that we care for 
 our own and that the regiment continues to care even after our service in uniform is over there is truth 
 in the saying once a patricia always a patricia the regiment is only as strong as its collective membership it 
 must always be remembered that the regiment is a collection of people we are the regiment and all that is 
 good about the regiment comes from those who serve and have served within her ranks while like any family there 
 may be aspects that are not liked by some family members every member of the family can strengthen or weaken 
 the fabric of the family through their own actions and attitude from the inside looking out i can see so 
 much that is good about the regiment and i encourage every patricia past and present to do what they can 
 to strengthen that good always remember to do what is right 
 the patrician 2004 5 rhq volunteer patricia program patricias helping patricias being a member of the regiment is like being 
 a member of an extended family once you join you are a member for life that s where our motto 
 once a patricia always a patricia comes from as in all families we each give it strength and when we 
 need it we can draw from the support of the family at large the ppcli association established the volunteer patricia 
 program in 2004 to help all members of the regimental family adjust to retirement and the changes this brings the 
 association s goal is to help you help yourself through the programs provided by veterans affairs canada by dnd and 
 the canadian forces by the legion and by other caregivers whether you are a soldier about to retire at the 
 end of your service are being retired because you can no longer serve or if you are already retired the 
 regimental association is always there to help you if you would like more information on the program visit www ppcli 
 com and follow the vpp prompts you will find all the contacts you need there or ask any branch of 
 the ppcli regimental association or rhq for information on the support the association can offer you and your family princess

 as beat of drum or bugle call at 10 00 p m recalling soldiers to quarters the term originated in 
 the 17th century holland from the dutch words tap toe meaning turn off the spigot this was the hour at 
 which innkeepers had to stop serving soldiers and send them on their way back to billets to announce tap toe 
 a sergeant and a guard of soldiers with drummers would march through the tavern district rounding up the troops and 
 sending them to quarters any innkeeper who failed to cooperate would find his establishment placed off limits to soldiers resulting 
 in a severe loss of trade any soldiers found outside after tap toe were jailed this practice gradually evolved taking 
 on the modern meaning of a military public display featuring bands drill and demonstration

 tenure the battalion deployed on several key exercises including ex patricia raider ex southern patricia to the united states and 
 the work up training for op athena roto 2 it was on these exercises that the battalion rebuilt itself as 
 new soldiers and new command teams gelled into an efficient fighting team lcol vida s time as co was highlighted 
 by op peregrine in august of 2003 when 1 ppcli distinguished itself in fighting the bc forest fires lcol vida 
 s sooty face and filthy coveralls were a testament to his personal drive and lead from the front leadership style 
 i lcol hope assumed command just as the battalion was deploying on ex prairie ram where the focus shifted gears 
 back to mechanized operations a coy red devils rule 2004 2004 was another busy year for the red devils the 
 influx of biq qualified troops in the spring meant a lot of training ex patricia raider and ex southern patricia 
 helped the new troops to feel more comfortable with their peers and learn other aspects of their profession the patrolling 
 phase during southern patricia was especially difficult as a big thunderstorm rendered movement difficult and taught some new soldiers that 
 they needed plastic bags in their rucksack upon returning from minnesota we learned that a coy would reinforce b coy 
 with a mech platoon for their deployment to afghanistan a coy supported the training of op athena troops by running 
 a level 5 live fire exercise the a coy pi in op athena arrived in afghanistan in august they accomplished 
 numerous different tasks including guarding the gate and acting as the qrf at camp julien patrolling in the streets of

 canada s drdc experimental series the battalion entered its training phase on the friday afternoon before spring break and was 
 declared operationally ready in the non combatant evacuation operation neo role only one month later not surprisingly the battalion spent 
 most of the spring in wainwright developing its collective warfighting skills which culminated in a live fire company group range 
 concurrent to its neo training the battalion provided 41 personnel for operation athena rotation 2 including a 28 man reconnaissance 
 platoon embedded training team ett elements and individual augmentees immediately prior to summer block leave the battalion conducted a change

 was full of courses training and exercises all which kept the company ready to go almost anywhere and do almost 
 anything it also saw changes in the company chain of command capt frederickson took over from capt mcloughlin as 2ic 
 
 the patrician 2004 36 3 vp and mwo murphy took over from mwo brunelle as csm the year began with 
 ibts training in edmonton and a beautiful springtime visit to wainwright which means be prepared for every type of weather 
 imaginable to conduct section and platoon live fire attacks followed by company level dry training on return to edmonton the 
 company went right into an aggressive round of training to fulfill its neo task in may the company practiced offensive 
 operations at all levels using miles gear that culminated in a company attack on a prepared defensive position in wainwright 
 the end of may saw the company training for crowd control operations and the use of non lethal force since 
 a company also provided their own enemy force the video for this event looked a little like beat your buddy 
 with a stick day in the end the crowd control training was extremely worthwhile and as a result a company 
 demonstrated their newfound techniques to the rest of the battalion june started with a company returning to a now somewhat 
 warmer wainwright to conduct two exercises the first was a detachment level patrolling exercise led by unsuspecting cpls and snr 
 ptes against british troops training in wainwright and the second was a company level live fire range this was followed 
 by ex patricia rescue 11 where a company demonstrated their skill and professionalism by supporting the training of c company 
 who where preparing to take over the neo function for the battalion for a company the summer of 2004 was 
 summarized with two words urban operations training started in july with the company focusing on developing individual through to platoon 
 level skills the month ended with ex quick strike which 
 the patrician 2004 37 3 vp incorporated both a jump and an attack on an urban site at the garrison 
 following block leave the company began using simunition to re enforce their drills and training which culminated in the deployment 
 to fort lewis for ex complex warrior for many this was the highlight of the year the company s soldiers 
 had a blast doing cqb in the kill houses and went on to both regensburg and lechi town urban warfare 
 sites to practise section to company sized attacks both by day and by night the highlight of this activity was 
 each platoon s turn in their own little black hawk down scenario complete with oscar winning performances by wo denkowycz 
 and recce platoon the realism size and complexity of lechi town made it an outstanding tool in developing the skills 
 and abilities of everyone from riflemen to the oc a company returned to canada and immediately began preparations to support 
 the ex prairie ram in wainwright and once again enjoyed its beautiful weather in november the company was involved in 
 ex joint response where lt buttons got his cax jump wings followed by the company s return to wainwright this 
 time to decent weather to conduct ex spartan shield the year ended with the silly season where troops participated in 
 menton days in fort lewis annual briefings and the usual holiday routine of festivities hockey games and the men s

 the patrician 2004 38 3 vp b company 2004 saw b company significantly improve its combat capability especially in urban 
 warfare the first half of the year was occupied with two pcf course cycles to bring our new recruits up 
 to speed and an urban warfare training exercise in ft lewis during the summer maj lutes took over as the 
 new oc from the departing maj dawe as fall rolled around the company again deployed to ft lewis for round 
 two of ex complex warrior after a two day bus ride with a night in kamloops that was more memorable 
 for some than others we arrived in ft lewis the exercise involved training from individual to company level and we 
 sought to improve on the skills already learned during the first deployment this time however much of the leadership within 
 the company had changed including the oc and several platoon commanders although there was a steep learning curve for the 
 new personnel by the end of the training the phrase do it could be heard over the company net followed 
 shortly afterwards by building secure after ft lewis b company participated in ex quantum leap in wainwright the system acceptance 
 trials sat for the new wes equipment this exercise allowed the company to practice platoon and company level operations with 
 added realism not available using conventional dry training methods during the trial personnel from cmtc were constantly seeking feedback on 
 the equipment wo surridge among others took up this task and eloquently described to the cmtc staff how to make 
 the system more realistic and more soldier friendly the final part of the year saw the company leave behind the 
 high tech world of urban combat and laser tag and return to more traditional training trench digging wire obstacles and 
 hmg sighting ex spartan shield a five day battalion exercise involved the company occupying a defensive position in wainwright during 
 this exercise mother nature cooperated with us dropping to well below 0 c and ensuing that sentries and the rest 
 of us remained awake lt thomas the acting company 2ic took it upon himself to ensure that the heater in 
 the company litis remained functional throughout this challenging exercise as b company heads into another year we are well prepared

 events and provided instructors for schools across the country needless to say it was a hectic challenging and rewarding year 
 for the entire company the first major exercise of 2004 was ft benning experiment series 7 fbes 7 an exercise 
 where c company deployed to ft benning georgia to support drdc with a view to trialing and evaluating new light 
 infantry kit the training combined mout and patrolling operations up to platoon level using various planning communication command and control 
 navigation and target acquisition equipment the exercise also tested the ability of the chain of command and the soldiers to 
 employ the 13 man 8 man and 4 man section structures within a platoon context fbes 7 was an outstanding 
 opportunity to utilize the us army s facilities get a sneak prevue of what equipment is coming to the infantry 
 and to practise section and platoon operations the next major exercises for c company were conducted in rapid successiop ex 
 patricia response and ex patricia rescue were both conducted to prepare the c company group to assume the neo task 
 ex patricia response was conducted at lfwatc wainwright and was designed to validate the offensive capability of the platoons and 
 the company group through live fire training ex patricia rescue was held in st albert and was a tactical neo 
 specific operation where c company deployed into an unstable region and extracted over 250 canadian entitled personnel while dealing with 
 local officials angry protesters and hostile rebels the exercise challenged the company s flexibility and set the conditions for successful 
 employment within a neo or three block war scenario the next major event for c company was the transfer of 
 the company parachute capability from a to c company the co s intent was to demonstrate the ability to regenerate 
 a parachute capable sub unit the rationale being with conflicting operational and training requirements it has become necessary for more 
 than one company to be parachute capable in order to guarantee that a full company is ready for insertion at 
 any time in any location on short notice hence the parachute capability was shifted to c company with a view 
 to expanding the parachute expertise within 3 ppcli and increasing the number of experienced jumpers available at any one time 
 c company accepted the challenge and has perpetuated the high standards set by a company 
 40 the patrician 2004 3 vp with the handover of the company parachute capability c company deployed on ex pegasus 
 a parachute delivered combined arms company group exercise this exercise was conducted at lfwatc wainwright using cc 130 platforms the 
 purpose of the exercise was to validate the company parachute capability within a collective training context confirming its employability as 
 an airborne force the initial phase of the exercise was a seize and hold operation follow on operations were subsequently 
 initiated including section sized patrols and parachute delivered re supply via cc 130 ex pegasus concluded with an engines remain 
 on ero extraction via cc 130 from an austere airstrip it was an excellent introduction to airborne operations for the 
 company and only increased the soldiers appetite for more challenges of this kind c company then participated in ex complex 
 warrior and ex spartan shield battalion initiatives that tested the soldiers on two very different skills ex complex warrior saw 
 c company deploy to ft lewis washington as a component of a battalion mout exercise featuring live fire room clearing 
 drills and entry drills culminating with company sized attacks in complex urban terrain next ex spartan shield took c company 
 to lfwatc wainwright yet again assessing their skills in the defence fighting through the november cold in wainwright the soldiers 
 of c company practiced developing defensive positions securing a bridge demolition guard establishing a defensive routine and finally withdrawing while 
 under contact the final exercise of the year was menton days a joint canadian american parachute activity in ft lewis 
 washington designed to commemorate the disbandment of the first special service force fssf this was an outstanding opportunity for the 
 soldiers to parachute train and socialize with the men currently serving in the first special forces group 1 sfg combat 
 support company as always combat support company conducted much of our training with the rifle companies from running platoon attack 
 ranges for a and b company to planning organizing and running the pre deployment training for exercise complex warrior combat

 exercise consisted of company group live fire training in wainwright this exercise provided not only an excellent training opportunity for 
 the rifle companies but also for signal platoon soldiers from the platoon participated in various roles during this exercise ranging 
 from command post operators right up to the commanding officer s signaler exercise patricia response was definitely a highlight of 
 the year after conducting a basic comms course in august elements of signal platoon moved south to ft lewis to 
 establish a rear link with the battalion in support of exercise complex warrior in november the battalion deployed to wainwright

 the end 2004 was a busy year for signal platoon both in the field and in garrison recce platoon started 
 2004 with a basic recce patrolman course serial which included a guided tour of western canada the course spent time 
 training in edmonton hinton kamloops chilliwack and comox in what was an excellent opportunity for the candidates to practice their 
 newly acquired skills springtime found some of our members in dundurn either as candidates or as instructors on the basic 
 sniper course following summer block leave the platoon now reconstituted following the departure of the op athena personnel organized and 
 staffed a patrol pathfinder pre course for candidates from across the bde in september and october the platoon concentrated on 
 supporting the rifle companies while working on our own cqb skills during exercise complex warrior in ft lewis wa our 
 snipers also attended both canadian army and u s army annual sniper concentrations in gagetown and ft benning ga respectively 
 in november we participated in the wes trials in wainwright in support of b company this was immediately followed by 
 ex spartan shield which gave the newer members of the platoon their first taste of recce operations in support of 
 the battalion throughout the training year the platoon also participated in parachute training taking every available opportunity to practice our 
 static line and freefall skills over the past year direct fire support platoon has gone through a period of much 
 change the platoon started the year with a focus on anti armour weapons running a basic tow gunner course and 
 several eryx gunner courses we ended the year preparing a ql 4 machine gun course after the winter pcf cycle 
 the platoon participated in and supported the battalion neo readiness exercises the platoon provided detachments to take part in the 
 training and key personnel to support the exercise validation for most of the fall members of the platoon were deployed 
 to ft lewis

 context dfs machine gun detachments worked for all three of the rifle companies dfs also supported the exercise by providing 
 several ncos to act as the training and safety cadre in november the platoon deployed a detachment with b company 
 in support of the systems acceptance trials in wainwright for cmtc in mid november for the first time since returning 
 from afghanistan dfs platoon deployed complete on exercise during exercise spartan shield a battalion defensive exercise held in wainwright the

 handing over the tow task to the ppcli manned tow company in the ldsh rc as a result this will 
 be the last patrician entry for the 3 ppcli dfs platoon as we will soon change our name to weapons 
 platoon op athena reconnaissance platoon was attached under operational command to the ldsh rc recce squadron for op athena roto 
 2 they were tasked to provide the oc recce squadron with a light reconnaissance capability recce pi was re configured 
 from its traditional composition to a 28 patrolman platoon that looked more similar to a rifle platoon the platoon had 
 six 4 patrolman detachments and a small headquarters element this proved to be frustrating at the beginning of the tour 
 the platoon had to get familiar not only with learning how they would work within an armoured reconnaissance squadron but 
 they had to learn how we would operate with a reduced c 2 element with the loss of the second 
 officer and no embedded support storesman signaller medics etc needless to say the first month in theatre was a steep 
 learning curve for all but the differences in capabilites between infantry and armoured elements were quickly overcome the platoon s 
 mission was to assist in establishing and maintaining a secure and stable environment within the kabul aoo they accomplished this 
 by ensuring that we executed all assigned tasks by maintaining the oc s philosophy of fairness utility of effort protection 
 of resolve and above all respect for the afghan people the platoon capitalized on the capabilities of other tfk kmnb 
 assets to maximize the unique surveillance reconnaissance capability inherent to our rotation more importantly the platoon remained prepared to force 
 project throughout the kabul aoo for extended time periods over six months it seemed that working 18 hours plus days 
 was the norm in camp the platoon 
 the patrician 2004 43 3 vp completed a total of 23 platoon section level operations and nine squadron level operations 
 they traveled throughout the kabul province and operated in areas that coalition forces from the us lead op enduring freedom 
 had not patrolled in over eight months needless to say the platoon operated in close proximity to known taliban and 
 al qaeda forces after a long tour the platoon is now in the process of commencing the relief inplace 0:relief 
 0:in 0:place with the incoming recce platoon relief in place is a more appropriate term to use than handover because 
 the platoon is conducting operations right up until the transfer of command authority the platoon did not stopping patrolling but 
 rather increased it during this vulnerable period in a couple of weeks the platoon will be commencing its redeployment leave 
 leave that was well earned their dedication professionalism and compassion towards the afghani locals have made the regiment proud administration 
 company admin company spent the year providing faithful and enthusiastic support to rifle company training activities a small cadre deployed 
 with b company in february to fort lewis wa once there the toms spent a considerable amount of time at 
 the post orderly room rumour has it she was 54 blond about sixty years 01d the spring was consumed with 
 support to neo related warfighting training in wainwright as usual admin company pulled out all of the stops to make 
 sure hundreds of soldiers were fed ammunition delivered vehicles recovered and ranges supported over the summer the company welcomed the 
 arrival of its new oc maj mckillop who took over from maj hackett the main effort of the company quickly 
 turned towards the ums as it became imperative to send captain airborne commando forestier the unit mo on just about 
 every course in nato the company also started preparing for a three month deployment to fort lewis for the second 
 part of ex complex warrior this exercise demanded most of the company s resources including a skeleton orderly room and 
 a robust supply and transportation element over the fall the qmsi discovered a few things about pant sizes sgt coupal 
 kept accidentally wandering into the men s showers and the qm became the battalion s krispy kreme officer over the 
 course of the exercise the company s soldiers and tradesmen distinguished themselves through their hard work and determination before redeploying 
 they were rewarded with a short r r period in seattle where several members of log platoon who shall remain 
 nameless paid a memorable courtesy call on hmcs calgary although back in canada admin company did not have much time 
 to rest the company deployed with the battalion into wainwright for ex spartan shield in this case the echelons were 
 exercised aggressively while supporting battalion defensive operations as the members of admin company depart on christmas leave they are already

 the francophone lifestyle and culture patricias at cflrs have continued to make their mark as tough and fair instructors and 
 have occasionally offered up a smile well the rumour is that sgt stang actually smiled in late summer though no 
 hard evidence is available it seems however cflrs is targeting patricias with their chewing tobacco policy who could have ever

 the patrician 2004 55 vp purple haze for those who have not made it out to the left coast cfrc 
 vancouver is comprised of three dets vancouver kelowna and victoria there is a satellite detachment in surrey and another one 
 will soon be opening up in richmond two of the most diverse suburbs of vancouver the staffs are as varied 
 as the population it recruits there are regular force and reserves from all elements different trades and civilian staff as 
 well this keeps the co major ralf urzinger quite busy with all the hr work involved in such a diverse 
 staffed work place sometimes he can be heard lamenting that writing pre deployment exercise instruction was not that difficult after 
 all and he misses them immensely his continued rant to us is that the best job in the world is 
 in the battalion in a leadership position and not sitting in a shiny office tower apparently he had a good 
 time in winnipeg whenever he gets grumpy he works it out with jogging and so far he has done two 
 marathons in victoria and vancouver in all fairness to the co working in the purple environment can be a bit 
 of a culture shock which many of the staff from a combat arms background have experienced yet more and more 
 commanders find themselves in situations where they must work in these environments whether overseas or at home good luck sir 
 one more year of ojt it was yet another memorable year at cfrc vancouver this was not only reflected in 
 the various policy changes and new recruiting initiatives but specifically for the patricias it meant saying good bye to two 
 of their comrades the first to depart his lofty position as detachment commander was capt tyrone green capt green came 
 to the recruiting center in early 2002 as a military career counsellor then moving his way up the food chain 
 to the position as the detachment commander for vancouver he will be missed mostly by some of the staff that 
 enjoyed capt green trotting around the centre in sweaty maroon pt gear he was overheard counselling one of his officer 
 peers not army that the clothing he was wearing was not an outfit but regimental pt gear worn by soldiers 
 any questions the biggest impact capt green s departure made was the reduction of revenues to various exotic dancer clubs 
 in the lower mainland we are not certain but it has been rumoured that many have gone into receivership since 
 he left well i guess he will be spending his hard earned canadian dollar overseas as a member of untso 
 op jade has anyone seen the captain know where he is i know where he is we also said good 
 bye to sgt werner muehlberger who was posted to ontario this brought a sigh of relief to most of us 
 who dreaded the day that the co would initiate unit pt and have werner lead one of the runs many 
 of the local gyms are now 
 56 the patrician 2004 vp freed up for membership now that the fitness guru has left the building on a 
 serious note muehly s sense of professionalism and his example will be sorely missed during his three years with us 
 sgt muehlberger was responsible for setting up displays at the various career and outdoor adventure shows in addition to this 
 he was the rappel master for two open house events held in vancouver if there was something out of the 
 ordinary required we went to the subject matter experts werner werner competed in many of the endurance races in the 
 area and when you live in the fitness capital of canada that can be quite daunting werner represented the recruiting 
 group and the cf very well we cannot talk about where he went to but rumour has it that he 
 had to change his pyjamas to black ones so the only patricia sr nco left standing after this year s 
 postings is me sgt huf mullick my primary task other than reminiscing about battalion war stories with the co is 
 to manage the surrey satellite detachment similar to commanding a section house the only thing missing is the section there 
 is no requirement to do vcps op s and cordon and searches those tasks are usually left to the surrey 
 rcmp and believe me they are busy in that neighbourhood i am kept very busy with the south asian portfolio 
 as a member of the diversity team and coordinate all outreach functions associated with that portfolio teaching young recruits the 
 essentials of military life has been replaced with school presentations and talk shows this might sound appealing to some but

 best in 05 lets continue to lead the army with the same pride and flare that the ppcli has become 
 known for french grey battalion greetings to our patricia brothers in arms across the country and around the globe the 
 year 2004 was just as busy as any other year for the infantry school so much so that the center 
 of excellence could have been re dubbed the center of change modifications in course content introduction of new courses such 
 as the urban ops course and the modularization of common army phase were just some of the initiatives that kept 
 members of the french grey battalion busy this past year 
 58 the patrician 2004 vp the french grey battalion is helmed by lfaatc comd lcol creighton and lfaa tc rsm 
 cwo bartlett the glue that holds us all together out here is the super adjutant captain rutland there are never 
 any tasks too hard or menial for captain rutland to pass off to any of the other junior patricia captains 
 out here a point of warning for anyone considering a posting to the infantry school maj patrick oc a coy 
 is the officer commanding of the french grey battalion assisted by his right hand man mwo penney csm a coy 
 we do believe the oc and csm are hard at work but it has become hard to tell since a 
 coy has moved offices out of bldg j 7 to across the street in k6 we still receive emails once 
 in awhile from maj patrick but we still have to confirm on occasion to make sure the wizard is still 
 in the land of oz it was not all work and no play of course for the patricias at ctc 
 gagetown mess life was as vibrant as always whenever patricias are together and even more so as fellow regimental members 
 were at ctc to complete their career or advanced courses as well as filling in as augmentee staff it was 
 not uncommon in 2004 to see an overwhelming number of patricias wandering the halls of j 7 a legacy left 
 by outgoing chief instructor major haverstock his departing gift to the infantry school was to greatly increase the number of 
 patricias at ctc subtly shifting the balance between the three regiments here in gagetown the greatest contributor to the cause 
 was the second battalion posting just under 15 personnel to the school in 2004 we do not know if it 
 was major haverstock s pitch of the laid back east coast living or the alternative of going to shilo that 
 brought everyone here but it seems as if everyone is happy with their choice to date who made this coffee 
 as mentioned courses here are continuously undergoing change and conversion new to the infantry school and the cf was the 
 introduction of the urban ops course captain macleod and wo towell were knee deep in ensuring this course which they 
 built from the ground up was good to go for their start date after a few days they came to 
 the same conclusion for the course more money more ammo more time we think capt 
 the patrician 2004 59 vp macleod was just pining for more swan visits to the u s but he means 
 well army transformation and the way we train our leaders resulted in changes in almost every leadership course it was 
 out with the old and in with the new as course smes and oics were brushing up on working in 
 complex terrain urban operations and night operations asymmetric training became the norm and staff and students ensured they were fully 
 briefed up for those regular visits from ctc hq including the trusty aide de camp the ppcli s own captain 
 hacault changes in philosophy and assessment were also a topic of conversation who could forget cap instructors mcpl yakabowich and 
 mcpl croucher discuss the benefits of mentoring over sink or swim method of assessment if there were ever two guys 
 who knew how to push each other s buttons it was these two and it made up for good entertainment 
 and a good break in the ds tent at 0200 hrs during patrol week summer training was especially busy this 
 year and school patricias played a major part in the training of hundreds of students the last phase iv infantry 
 course was run this summer replaced by dpi 2 in the future and graduating candidates were extremely happy to be 
 finally badged into the regiment by the colonel of the regiment mgen ret d stewart we are fairly sure the 
 last dawe brother has finally been trained by the school but we will wait and see captains williams gill and 
 clark trained the majority of the graduating patricias while captain rutland fresh from his stint in valcartier was busy handling 
 the franco platoon wo grant must have spent the majority of his summer doing pt behind did you say you 
 were ticklish the lav s because right after ph iv he began the advanced recce course not as an instructor 
 as a candidate his completion of the course shows that even when approaching 40 you can still show the young 
 pups how it s done of course it helps when you are constantly the candidate platoon 2ic in the field 
 and you make all the young officers hump your kit we will leave you with a few random thoughts from 
 the school over the past year for those of you wondering how wo thornton is doing out here we would 
 like to know the same thing there have been a few wo thornton sightings through the year but none were 
 confirmed if you do see him in your travels please let 2ic a company know the swan of the year 
 award definitely goes to wo holwell who has spent approximately four days on the grounds at the school the rest 
 being on td in possibly all seven continents we hope the school gets a positive return on all this newfound 
 knowledge wo holwell 
 60 the patrician 2004 vp after all you have used a quarter of the school s budget on your travel 
 claims alone the that s gotta hurt award was a tie this year between lav driver cpl gofton and mwo

 ll blame this one on the crew commander cpl gofton don t worry who could forget the scary sight of 
 cpl gofton covered in oil stripped down to his underwear in the lawfield corridor don t worry there aren t 
 any pictures chris mwo cromwell suffered a devastating acl tear in a friendly game of volleyball before christmas to gain 
 the tie with cpl gofton he was trying to save some face for hq coy s overall dismal performance at 
 the infantry school s year end sports competition but it wasn t meant to be get well soon well that

 was held from 20 to 23 july 2004 this march is the world s largest walking event and is also 
 one of the world s largest sporting events football tournament and better fitness through after school sports and games laid 
 the foundation for the nijmegen international four days marches every year the walk starts on the third tuesday in july 
 in the span of six weeks over 47 000 people registered for the event one of the registrants was our 
 immediate past president of the association and retired regimental sergeant major mr jac de bruijne for those interested in participating 
 in the event jac has provided the following tips to prepare oneself i recommend that you listen carefully to your 
 body choose a distance that you feel comfortable with to start with this is my recommended training schedule starting in 
 mid march start with daily walks of 10 km april daily walks of 12 km and with two weekly walks 
 of 24 km each morning and evening may daily walks of 15 km and with two weekly walks of 24 
 km each morning and evening june daily walks of 15 km and two weekly walks of 30 km and july 
 daily walks of 15 km and three weekly walks of 35 km one week prior to the event to recover 
 from jet lag attempt to arrive in holland one full week before the marches to acclimate your body careful attention 
 must be paid to the most important ingredient to the success of this adventure your feet remember walking should be 
 fun but if you neglect your feet walking can be hell soaking your feet after completing your daily walks in 
 a solution of sea salt or epson salts and warm water will toughen the skin of your feet biweekly application 
 of olive oil to your feet will prevent cracking and make the skin more pliable not softer good quality cotton 
 socks will ensure moisture is dissipated quickly through your shoes and evaporated turn your socks inside out as the outside 
 is smoother and the seams will then face outward preventing blisters do not wear woolen socks they slide they are 
 poor absorbers of moisture and they contain 10 15 nylon that will cause your feet to burn use a good 
 quality foot powder this will ensure a pair of socks will last for 40 km and always have a spare 
 pair of socks on you just in case lastly you need good fitting walking shoes or boots they should not 
 constrict the blood flow to your feet when the laces are tightened leather is the best choice but other materials 
 will do editors note jac made the following observations to me first that he must have over trained as he 
 found the marches this year not as challenging as before secondly he observed other fellows from the regiment general romses 
 who may have not trained enough the hardest part of the four day event for jac was fighting with the 
 crowd at the end of each day to find his bicycle to get to his lodging for the night and 
 lastly upon nearing the finish line he retrieved his regimental blazer tie and beret and crossed the finish line turned 
 out so that everyone would know that the patricia s were there rsm ret d jac de bruijne is a 
 korean war veteran was the president of the association from 1999 until 2003 and in 2003 proudly earned his dutch

 the patrician 2004 67 vp patricia named honorary citizen ispica sicily has anyone seen the major i know where he 
 is he s down in the deep dug out how do you know i saw him i saw him down 
 in the deep dug out ispica a typical sicilian town perched on a steep cliff overlooking the country to the 
 southeast as far as the beaches was a natural defensive position manned by a determined enemy it could have offered 
 a stout defence but it had been occupied by italian troops after a heavy shelling from hms delhi on july 
 11th and a heavy aerial bombardment the town had surrendered without a fight during the 60th anniversary pilgrimage of veterans 
 the municipal administration of ispica sicily because of the affection that colonel frost continues to reveal on every occasion and 
 which connects him to the city of ispica decided to number him among its most illustrious citizens conferring on him 
 an honorary citizenship of ispica as a permanent reminder of that brief but significant period that saw him as a 
 young administrator of their city charles sydney frost born in 1922 attended the royal military college of canada after graduation 
 in 1942 he was assigned to the princess patricia s canadian light 
 68 the patrician 2004 vp infantry and served in the army in europe in 1945 he was promoted to acting 
 second in command of his battalion he was wounded twice in action he is the author of two books once 
 a patricia 1988 and always a patricia 2004 dedicated to his experiences in the second world war in particular his 
 landing on sicily and becoming the first democratic mayor of ispica free of fascism he entered ispica with his platoon 
 as he recalls in chapter vii of his book once a patricia frost ran the town for a brief period 
 july 16 to august 1943 without any external help including his own headquarters the fourth reinforcement battalion stationed in pachino 
 he took over the former fascist headquarters casa del fascio located in the present day antonio brancati square while the 
 population 13 000 plus reassured was returning home from the caves the canadian re opened the mill kept it functioning 
 day and night and distributed food from its headquarters on the 25th of july at the news of the fall 
 of mussolini the young canadian officer at the request of a fellow citizen expressed a reflection as follows may the 
 lights come on again all over the world and all people live in freedom justice and equality the call finally 
 came on august 3rd i lost no time in handing over my duties as town major to captain guthrie i 
 was relieved to be on my way at last and excited about the prospect of action but i left my 
 first real command with a tinge of sadness as town major of ispica i had received a unique education that 
 was not printed in any army manual and that very few young officers would ever experience none of my prior 
 training had prepared me for such a test in only a few weeks i had seen the people of ispica 
 shake off the terrible yoke of fascism and make a fresh start on the road to democracy they had worked 
 hard to rebuild their town and their sicilian way of life they had found new confidence and hope for the 
 future at the casa del fascio i held my last parade to say goodbye to the people i had come 
 to understand and respect the mayor the police chief the baron of modica dr lentini father pietro the priest signer 
 salvatore signorina franzo signer fratele and his daughter as i turned to leave signorina fratele pressed into my hand a 
 good luck charm with tears in her eyes she said noi amoriamo voi per favour ritornate presto i jumped into 
 my vehicle and drove away i did in fact return to my beloved ispica 13 years later but that is 
 another story as amgot s allied military government of occupied territories report states frost had succeeded in restoring the civic 
 administration of ispica and had fostered an orderly and peaceful co existence and harmony between the population and the allied 
 forces 
 the patrician 2004 69 vp charles sydney frost had given clear proof of his generous love towards the city not 
 only by returning as a pilgrim so many times from 1990 1997 but also by helping to finance the monuments 
 erected where the allied forces landed at porto ulisse which remind us of the sacrifice of the canadian and italian 
 soldiers and the civilians for whom frost has shown great respect the societa ispicese di storia patria believed that it 
 is more than just to award honorary citizenship to this canadian gentleman who has fond memories of ispica for having 
 been the first protagonist of the rebirth of the city in democracy and in freedom and for having demonstrated from 
 the war up to the present time a profound and sincere attachment of ispica and its population acting more as 
 a brother and friend than as an enemy or invader editor s note regrettably mr frost was unable to attend 
 the ceremony the presentation of the award was witnessed by our regimental representative for the pilgrimage mr doug armstrong senator 
 gerard phalen accepted the award on behalf of colonel frost the regiment mourns the loss of a fallen hero jonas 
 starblanket fought with the patricia s throughout the italian campaign during ww ii and in korea at the battle of 
 kapyong at home he was a well respected clan elder and very active member of the community the second battalion 
 ppcli had just started settling into their christmas leave when the call came to stand up a full military funeral 
 party the community of atahkakoop one hour outside of prince albert saskatchewan were most impressed with the arrival of the 
 patricias it was then that the community realized that there was more to mr starblanket s family in attendance were 
 five aboriginal veterans two of which were patricias lest we forget

 the patrician 2004 71 vp jack cathie at war after joining the princess patricia s canadian light infantry ppcli in 
 1936 at work point barracks simply because the navy was no longer recruiting private jack cathie found himself sent to 
 england at the outbreak of world war ii as part of the advance party for the ppcli for the next 
 four years jack would serve overseas starting as a physical training instructor for the ppcli then moving on to train 
 officers with a canadian officer training unit cotu in 1941 he found himself promoted and made the regimental sergeant major 
 rsm of the headquarters for the ist canadian armoured brigade 1 cab after a year as the unit s disciplinarian 
 his position changed again and he found himself to be an officer cadet entering sandhurst as a member of the 
 calgary tank regiment 14th canadian army tank regiment the purpose of this piece is to recount jack s experiences as 
 a junior officer in training and combat during world war 11 following a passing out parade from sandhurst in april 
 1943 the newly minted lieutenant cathie returned to the brigade headquarters of 1 cab the training had been anything but 
 tough for a former drill and physical training instructor and jack was recognized as the top cadet in his class 
 earning the privilege of commanding the graduation parade his attendance at a british school was the result of his having 
 taught at a canadian officer training unit one could simply not be a student where he had once been an 
 instructor the training was quite basic with little emphasis on tactics as jack later remembered i think we got to 
 fire one shot out of an old churchill tank and a couple of short lectures by disabled fellows coming home 
 from north africa with training completed and a commission in hand cathie joined the hq in which he had once 
 been rsm back with 1 cab lieutenant cathie found himself to be a supernumerary officer and with little in the 
 way of formal tasks by june he was on a ship bound for north africa and subsequently sicily where he 
 landed south of pachino with the ist canadian division sicily was for a junior officer in brigade headquarters relatively quiet 
 as jack described it his duties consisted of mostly reconnaissance and any time they wanted an officer to do something 
 like to take over a guard or to do anything that a young officer could do they gave it to 
 me most the time i was just hanging around trying to keep out of trouble so we went up along 
 the cattaniafn coast during his time in sicily jack faced only members of the italian army in his opinion the 
 italians were just dropping their arms in front of us they were only too glad to be out of it 
 and wanted to go home 
 72 the patrician 2004 vp as with any operation not all time was spent fighting the enemy sicily and the 
 town of riposto still hold a fond memory i had a guitar l don t know where it came from 
 but it was my guitar lt had obviously been in my kit and somebody had found it and got it 
 to me so i sat on the beach and played and in the dark behind the bonfire i could sense 
 there were a bunch of italians so i start singing oh so lo mio well they were just thrilled to 
 pieces cause i didn t know the words really and they were filling it in for me with the words 
 you know and cheering because i was singing an italian song and they were very friendly and uh they brought 
 some wine for my fellow soldiers with the situation in sicily well under control the canadians prepared to cross the 
 straits of messina and advance up the south eastern coast after landing unopposed south of the town of reggio in 
 early september 1943 the canadians found that the germans were withdrawing up the italian mainland extremely quickly filling the duties 
 of a reconnaissance officer in a new scout car cathie was told to get along the coast road as far 
 as i could get and radio back if i saw anything that i thought was worthy of a stonk i 
 guess i was one day behind them all the time cathie found that the germans were moving rapidly mining and 
 destroying the routes behind them indeed jack found that they would blow about one bridge out of five the days 
 were spent patrolling and moving checking the myriad routes to the towns and villages along the path of the canadian 
 advance northward the germans did not put up much of a fight during the fall with no major battles being 
 fought by 1 cab for cathie the threats came in the form of occasional appearances by the luftwaffe and both 
 anti tank and anti personnel mines which were seldom thought about by mid september 1943 lieutenant cathie found himself in 
 cassano where he was confronted by something none of his training had prepared him for the mass surrender of a 
 brigade of italian infantry to a lone canadian officer so i went up into cassano cause i wanted to make 
 sure it was clear of hostiles and i asked for the podesta the mayor he told me that the germans 
 had long since left and here a brigade of italian infantry surrendered to me they were all lined up along 
 side the road with their small guns you know anti tank guns all lined up i took the guy s 
 dagger he had a little dagger and a pistol i disarmed him you see laughs and i had that little 
 beretta pistol when i came home from the war he was going to give me his sword i said i 
 didn t want his sword they were only too happy to see me and i said well you walk down 
 that way they were delighted that a canadian had taken them prisoner continuing his advance first in a sherman tank 
 and then upon a motorcycle without the benefit of brakes cathie cut quite the appearance forsaking the issue canadian uniform 
 he motored along wearing khaki shorts and a khaki shirt exactly the same as the german paratroopers wear and a 
 pair of black jack boots with my pips turned over this nearly caused his demise in the town of foggia 
 when a british paratrooper challenged him in the manner one would expect from a soldier in combat while lieutenant cathie 
 was standing in the town square jack quickly replied dryly querying well you silly bugger so you re going to 
 start knocking off canadian officers now with tension eased the two then discussed where the known german positions were throughout 
 the fall the germans continued to give ground under pressure the main threat that canadian armour faced was the german 
 88mm anti tank anti aircraft 0:anti 0:tank 0:anti 0:air 0:craft gun firing a high velocity armour piercing round with an 
 extremely flat trajectory it was certainly respected in cathie s words the anti tank guns were deadly their 
 the patrician 2004 73 vp tanks were good t 00 they the 88mm rounds could go through our metal except 
 for the gun mantle the shell would still be in one piece going in through the tank by late october 
 1 cab found itself in reserve where it would essentially stay for the bulk of the winter the cost to 
 the calgary tanks of the advance up sicily and italy to this point had been 15 killed and 16 wounded 
 between january and april 1944 the canadians were largely occupied with the business of holding their salient on the eastern 
 coast of italy near the town of ortona with the spring the commanders set their sites on the liberation of 
 rome and the breaching of the two defensive lines that blocked the allies from their goal the oustav and hitler 
 lines it was here that now captain cathie s war came to an end west of monte casino near the 
 liri river captain cathie was standing outside of his tank when he was caught in a mortar barrage and severely 
 wounded in the leg he had his wounds dressed and was subsequently evacuated out of the fight to return to 
 canada he had been in combat almost continuously for just over ten months dr cathie s experiences are not what 
 one would typically imagine thinking of a canadian officer during the second world war never having fought in a major 
 set piece battle he spent much of his time operating independently in his own words i was very lucky i 
 m just as glad you know it could have been curtains now nearing ninety years of age he remains active 
 in the regiment that provided his first taste of military life back in 1936 dapper charming and possessing a keen 
 wit it is easy to imagine him as a young man in khaki advancing north in an italian autumn editor

 the patrician 2004 78 association message from the president my message last year ended with the challenge to patricias about 
 to retire to join the association and thus strengthen the regimental family our focus has remained with our membership and 
 will remain so in the coming year we have had another full and varied year besides the annual general meetings 
 of council and that of members our branches across the country were equally active addressing their local issues head on 
 as seen from their respective reports a major accomplishment for the association this past year and one that prepares us 
 to become a new type of association has been the establishment of the volunteer patricia program while an ambitious program 
 it will challenge the association s resources and indeed the membership to meet the needs of veterans and their families 
 i appeal to all patricias about to leave the regiment or about to retire find out if this program can 
 be of assistance to you if so our representatives are available and will help you by now most branches have 
 appointed a member to be the vpp contact point for any one seeking assistance or guidance to provide clarity and 
 consistency a brochure has been produced and distributed to all members of the association and to units of the regiment 
 regimental headquarters is the central agency that will coordinate the initial contacts for serving members of the regiment who are 
 not yet familiar with the association i e your regimental association it is important that you know what we are 
 about your association is a not for profit organization with two registered charities i e the hamilton gault memorial fund 
 and the ppcli association regimental fund regimental fund that provide for the charitable activities of the regiment as a whole 
 the association was founded in 1947 and incorporated as a corporation without share capital in 1953 as such the association 
 provides the corporate umbrella for all regimental activities the titular head of the association is the colonel in chief fulfilling 
 the role as the patron the colonel of the regiment is the honorary chairman of council the governing body of 
 the association the membership of the association consists of retired or former members of the regiment we also have serving 
 patricias as members and currently our membership stands at 832 regular members 1 honorary life member 5 honorary members 12 
 life time members and 14 associate members the association is governed by an elected volunteer board council represented by the 
 branch presidents and the officers the officers are the president vice president vice presidents east and west and secretary treasurer 
 this position is normally filled by the regimental adjutant 
 the patrician 2004 79 association on a personal note as the end of my first term as your president approaches 
 i must say that it has been an honour and privilege to serve the membership not only the last two 
 years but also since 1982 i have had the opportunity to serve as secretary treasurer chairman of both finance and 
 bylaw committees and as vice president for two terms it has been a fulfilling and learning experience and i have 
 enjoyed the challenges immensely i want to thank council members past and present and the members of the secretariat for 
 their support it has been a joy to work for you i also wish to thank the membership for trusting 
 me to lead our organization for the last two years i am proud to be a member of an organization 
 that is willing to embrace change and grow with it i believe that council has become quite comfortable with its 
 fiduciary duty and as a policy governance board for the whole regiment should the membership so decide i look forward 
 to serving another term as president and look forward to working with the members of council who are energized creative 
 and committed to excellence and more importantly are committed to our association since we are not yet at the point 
 where the association is healthy and financially self sustaining the association must continue to make every effort to achieve that 
 goal our annual donation campaign will continue with many members supporting us the association will continue to direct 80 percent 
 of casino revenues to the regimental museum and archives the association s contribution and support over the years added substantially 
 to the excellence and state of the museum and archives to ensure that we are moving in the right direction 
 council and the finance committee are developing a new governance structure that will affect both association charitable organizations i e 
 the hamilton gault memorial fund and the ppcli association regimental fund we must be prepared to meet new legislative rules 
 that will face the not for profit sector in the future ultimately we are working toward a new and renewed 
 association that can be more focused and more responsive more efficient and more accountable throughout 2004 council with the assistance 
 of regimental headquarters were committed to becoming energized and creative change is challenging and there is no doubt that the 
 association is poised for major changes it also means that we must stop doing activities that consume resources but no 
 longer contribute to moving us in this new direction change is sometimes difficult for people to accept but it is 
 essential if our association is to remain relevant and meaningful in changing times vancouver branch the branch held the annual 
 general meeting in january with the current executive into the second year of their present term on sunday march 14

 successful as well as entertaining event regimental headquarters the ist battalion and the gs transport platoon of the base were 
 very instrumental in their assistance and cooperation in making the event the success it was the edmonton branch presented plaques 
 in appreciation for their efforts overall things went very well with the exception of a couple of minor hiccups that 
 were rectified quickly due to planning measures numbers and date time lines etc a few walk ups were disappointed in

 that it happened but people knew this event was going to happen for about a year we received accolades galore

 after paying all of the bills and making a donation to the museum the branch would like to volunteer to 
 host the 95th anniversary along with the agm with the blessings of all unless another branch is willing to take 
 it on the surplus funds would be seed money for the 95th anniversary we plan to present our proposal to 
 council in due course the edmonton branch was glad to pitch in and assist the endeavour of providing christmas gifts 
 and comforts to our serving patricias in theatres of operations overseas we hope they enjoyed what was sent and that 
 it helped lighten up their christmas away from home and families and to let the troops know that they are 
 not forgotten by those of us at home on the other side of the coin our branch lost two members 
 during the year long time member and wwii veteran don gower and korean veteran jack shields passed away they will 
 both be missed by our membership as 2005 is well on the horizon we look forward to another great year

 of you in wainwright and calgary later on this year manitoba and northwest ontario branch year 2004 was a landmark 
 in history of the manitoba and northwest ontario branch after a quarter of a century of close association with second 
 battalion using their facilities at winnipeg s kapyong barracks and conducting so many of our activities in conjunction with theirs 
 we have had to wean ourselves and learn to manage on our own in unfamiliar surroundings we began the year 
 with our annual meeting in the charleswood legion on february 11th originally scheduled for january 28th it had been postponed 
 because of v a bitter minus 38 degree wind chill branch president len king and vice president cliff fox were 
 re elected and the secretary treasurer s office was split with fred breurkens taking over as branch secretary and d 
 arcy best retaining the treasurer s duties our last official branch function in the kapyong barracks wos and sgts mess 
 was the annual ladies day on march 21st it was not as well attended as we would have liked but 
 those who were there enjoyed themselves on march 30th branch member bob cumming accompanied second battalion s co and rsm 
 to the land force western area training centre detachment in shilo manitoba and was given the honour of presenting ppcli 
 hat badges to the graduates of basic infantryman qualification course serial 0402 and on june 16th stu weeks was called 
 upon to do the same for serial 0404 second battalion golfers dominated the branch s annual golf tournament on may 
 21st with corporal pat mullin scoring the tournament s low gross and warrant officer kevin lewis low net paul ryan 
 and jerry franc were low gross and low net respectively among the association members thirty two association members 2ppcli personnel 
 and friends played in the tournament a few tears were shed on june 20th when second battalion said farewell to 
 the 
 the patrician 2004 88 association citizens of winnipeg and the city they have called home for 34 years the sunday 
 ceremonies at kapyong barracks began with a farewell tattoo opening with the old guard marching on to the beat of 
 the second battalion corps of drums then during a performance by the pipes and drums of the queen s own 
 cameron highlanders the sky opened up and a torrential downpour sent the spectators scrambling for cover to their credit the 
 camerons carried on without missing a beat when the rain abated the spectators returned to the sound of the 2701 
 ppcli cadet corps drum line and watched an unarmed combat demo by young soldiers fresh off basic training the tattoo 
 concluded with performances by the 1 canadian air division band and the flag party of the ppcli association s manitoba 
 and northwest ontario branch the tattoo was followed by second battalion s change of command ceremony where lieutenant colonel mike 
 day handed the battalion over to lieutenant colonel stu sharpe then led by their new commanding officer the battalion marched 
 off the kapyong barracks parade square for the last time we had been concerned that moving from our old home 
 in the second battalion wos sgts mess might hurt attendance at our annual dinner but on october 23rd 46 members 
 and friends including some we hadn t seen for a while sat down at the charleswood legion for an excellent 
 meal prepared and served by their ladies auxiliary all comments were favourable and we are looking forward to an even 
 better turnout next year bob cumming stu weeks and d arcy best got up before the birds on november 11th

 14th was very poor with only eight patricia family members present there were no wwii vets only one korean war 
 vet and for the first time in recent years there was no representation from our serving component as we did 
 not have second battalion s colours with us this year don collins and archie moore paraded the national and branch

 line accompanied by no less than five pipers treated us to an excellent performance after dinner we joined the warrant

 92 the patrician 2004 cadets 2701 ppcli army cadet corps kapyong barracks this past training year has been an exceptional 
 one for the cadets of 2701 ppcli army cadet corps along with having the normal training schedule and dnd activities 
 we participated in activities such as sports shooting and time in the field during the training year of 2004 we 
 successfully completed two corps exercises one of the exercises took place in shilo manitoba and the other took place in 
 richer manitoba on the exercises the cadets were introduced to the basics of fieldcraft field movement orienteering and brushed up 
 on their knots we ran the last exercise of the year in a fashion in which the four sections completed 
 the weekend exercise as a competition where they were scored on every stand their bivouac site and their teamwork among 
 other things everyone who participated on the exercises came back knowing more and saying that they had a great time 
 in the field as well as all the wonderful training we under took this year we received the commander certificate 
 along with the thompson trophy for the best army cadet corps in manitoba and northwestern ontario we believe that receiving 
 this trophy really boosted the esprit de corps this year our corps once again had a competetive shooting team as 
 well as a nicely turned out band and magnificent drumline our rifle team this year was composed of cwo anil 
 sukhan mwo jenn mccall sgt blake davidson sgt andrew greeley and cdt cody vernie the rifle team made it this

 competition in st john s newfoundland sgt blake davidson we also as in previous years made it possible for all

 year with the running team recreational shooting various sports and practise time for the corps drumline this year our drumline 
 had many members ranging in rank from cwo to first year cadets being a member of the drumline takes a

 cwo matthew dumas mwo jenn mccall wo cody perreria sgt james waldie sgt joel gange mcpl mandy burton and cdt 
 cody vernie the drumline performed for such events as the mess dinners of the second battalon ppcli the 303 rockwood 
 legion and various other events the drumline s final performance of the year was at the change of command parade 
 for the second battalon princess patricia s canadian light infantry this we believe started the summer off in a good 
 way during the summer we were very fortunate to send several cadets on advanced training and exciting events we were 
 only able to do this as we had a seven out of seven pass rate this year on nsce national 
 star certification examination along with having a complete pass rate we had the top three places including the general howard 
 award for top score on nsce with results like these some of our senior cadets were able to go on

 98 the patrician 2004 vp ppcli wo s snr nco s club the year 2004 has been a busy one 
 for our club members with most involved in planning their summer travel agendas the main one in mind being the 
 regiment s 90th anniversary some decision making was required in dealing with the two venues edmonton and winnipeg the question 
 being could they attend both fortunately many of our members were able to attend and enjoy both celebrations unfortunately i 
 had to cancel out on our winnipeg trip due to a last minute medical appointment not having any desire to 
 return to the back of the medical bus our membership attendance for the 90th edmonton celebrations was approximately 120 with 
 110 attending our 90th farewell breakfast at the ramada inn on the sunday morning of our final day we regret 
 that our invited guests could not attend which was understandable as they were tied up with some final events the 
 club s last event for 2004 was our agm which took place at the piklee post on the 15th of 
 september with our normal agenda consisting of good food good comradeship good beer and a short business meeting followed by 
 true stories and memories of the good times recalled and related into the late hours 
 99 the patrician 2004 vp our 29th anniversary annual dinner will be held at the fairmont hot springs lodge on 
 the 19th of may 2005 an event which all members look forward to we hope for a good attendance although 
 much aware of the fact that after 29 years time age and medical problems take their toll and for some 
 traveling is just not in the cards with great sadness we must report the passing of fifteen of our members 
 in 2004 our sincere best wishes for a great 2005 to patricias everywhere with emphasis on our soldiers and all 
 military personnel who are presently serving on our many overseas missions may you all complete your tours successfully and return 
 home safely
