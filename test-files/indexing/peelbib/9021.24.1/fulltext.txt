 prominence the abominable habit which is affected by a certain class of people in this part of the country of
 carrying revolvers on all and every occasion and sometimes shooting them off at inopportune times the idea that any man
 around town has the slightest necessity for packing a gun is absolutely ridiculous and the practice is maintained either from
 affectation or a desire to appear tough the fashion which prevails in the states of shooting men instead of knocking
 them down is brutal cowardly and uncivilized and it should be brought pretty well home that it will not be
 tolerated in alberta the cowboy of the western states affects the air of a bold down right fellow but the
 gun play which he has brought into vogue instead of being a manly form of diversion is a cowardly trick
 borrowed from the mexican and spanish american there is something sickening to the anglo saxon mind in arbitrating trivial quarrels
 with bullets in western canada we don t want yet a while to see every second man going around with
 a revolver as we may see in montana just across our borders calgary herald mar 20 1902 4 bill peyto
 gordon burles tile history of the canadian rockies is studded with numerous interesting characters a few of whom tend to
 bear out in some way the traditional description of the west as wild one of these who also made a
 substantial contribution to opening up the rockies was bill peyto the colourful guide outfitter soldier and park warden of the
 early days of banff national park like many other frontiersmen ebenezer william peyto seems to have found his native england
 too confining so he emigrated to canada in 1886 at the age of eighteen travelling the length of the country
 on the newly completed canadian pacific railway he was at moberley b c in 1887 where he met pioneer guide
 tom wilson the discoverer of lake louise although peyto apparently homesteaded near cochrane soon after arriving by 1895 he was
 chief guide in wilson s tourist outfitting business at banff the recently established bill peyto rocky mountains park with its
 lavish banff springs hotel warm mineral springs and few years bear the name of peyto lake first rate scenery was
 attractina more and two years later in 1897 bill peyto more visitors the more adventurous of guided the noted british
 chemist j norman whom began to explore the park s remoter collie along with charles fay c s thompreaches son

 explorers bow lake the party made the first ascent robert l barrett and walter d wilson of mount gordon and
 named mounts col to giant mount assiniboine in the sum lie baker and thompson around them on mer of 1895
 with these two americans the wapta icefield and mount mummery he took part in the first explorations a farther west
 round the base of the mountain wilcox was impressed by peyto s ability with a few days later collie baker
 and sarhorses and noted his cowboy appearance bach returned to the same area again led and bravado peyto told tales
 of a roving by peyto this time their destination was difficult life and armed himself against howse pass and what
 they thought was somewhat imaginery dangers like indians mount murchison north of the pass it turned out not to be
 murchison but mount immediately after this peyto guided wil forbes the highest mountain in presentcox into the country north of
 lake louise they explored bow glacier and were a mr buries was born in banfi and remong the first white

 the existence of the referred to peyto lake for the first time columbia icefield collie carried or the and it
 is likely that he named the lake plane table survey and what he had earlier peyto glacier and peyto peak
 for his guide thought to be david douglas mythical on this trip also along the way the party giants mount
 brown and mount hooker made the first ascent of mount sarbach were at last realized to be mounts columnear the
 howse river explored the fresh bia and alberta on the return trip via field glacier and tried to climb mount
 bow pass to lake louise an unsuccess forbes more significantly perhaps baker ful attempt was made on mount murchistarted a
 plane table survey which was car son and the first ascent of mount thompned on later by collie and produced
 the son was accomplished all in all it was an first good map of the region incredible journey covering more
 than 300 miles made possible collie admitted by peyto s part ot these journeys must have the resolution of peyto
 and his men been an arduous one for it involved finding the route clearing and blazing a way certain aspects
 of peyto s character inthrough deadfall packing and caring for terested and sometimes amused collie the horses and setting up
 and maintaining peyto language was often coarse and the camp he was particularly concerned picturesque especially when horses were about
 the welfare of his pack animals often lost or he was being asked to do the imto the point of
 irritating his guests he possible he was pessimistic about life and would camp early to give the horses a rest
 preoccupied with death and the ways it or give them a forty minute break during might come to one crossing
 the mistaya the day and when the flies became hor river he philosophically noted that if one rendous he covered
 the horses with bacon were to hit one s head on a stone in the grease and drove them into
 the creek it river one would die easily was largely the experience and ability of packers like peyto that made
 the exploring when collie returned to the rocicies in and climbing of the rockies possible 1900 bill peyto was still
 roughriding but on the veldt of south africa the story is reaching howse pass peyto reconnoi told that with the
 onslaught of the boer tred ahead and found the canyon of the war bill and his friend jack sinclair flip
 blaeberry river too difficult for horses ped a coin to see who would enlist and therefore the party bushwacked over
 a who would stay to look after their small pass which collie named for g p baker copper mine west
 of banff bill lost and and which led them to field b c this joined up with lt col sam

 him the following year 1 898 peyto was a a deep feather bed to sleep in but when gain engaged
 by collie along with two morning came she found him asleep on other englishmen hugh stutfield and her the hard
 floor probably he was toughenmann woolley this trip took them north ing himself up or had concluded that of lake
 louise via the pipestone river and feather beds were for dudes siffleur river across wide stretches of alpine meadow to
 the north saskatchewan of his war service stories are told of river then upstream to the columbia ice him drawing
 fire for the imperial forces field en route mount wilson was named he would gallop horseback in front of enfor

 mount wilcox and wilcox pass were nam found an umbrella somewhere and carried ed first ascents of mount athabasca dia

 and parade the vicinity of the icefield were accom about with the umbrella raised again to plished as well it
 was in fact this expedi draw the boer s fire apparently he did 6 bill peyto was photographed at one
 of his cabins with his saddle horse pack horse and dog this for six months having two horses shot lake
 and yoho pass out from under him but escaping injury himself whymper was an aristocratic and demanding person whose impatience
 was not another story describes him and other smoothed by late trains discontented guides soldiers stealing an officer s capecoat
 with bad weather and inefficient services in time liquor in it when sam steele denianded yoho valley he and peyto
 began a quarrel its return peyto returned two bottles and which lasted several weeks during the for his honesty was
 docked a month s pay course of which peyto complied less and and lost his corporal s stripes less with
 whymper s wishes he began to camp where he saw fit and to find excuses returning a hero from the
 plains of to leave whymper s party whenever he south africa bill went back to the out could to make
 matters worse pevto befitting business this time with his own came ill on a number of occasions he pack outfit
 one of his first patrons was showered whymper with oaths and the noted english climber and conqueror curses of the
 matterhorn edward whymper under the auspices of the c p r whymper when the party moved back to field was
 to expore and publicize the canadian peyto threatened to sue his patron he pacific rockies hiring bill peyto he and
 soon calmed down however and received his swiss guides headed over vermilion payment parting from whymper on very pass to
 expore the ball pass and boom bad terms the details of the quarrel are lake region their efforts were hampered
 not entirely clear though it is obvious that by rain and snow so they moved up to whymper was not
 peyto s kind of man lake louise and eventually on to field it is also clear that peyto was doing
 the from here they began explorations into lion s share of the work since the swiss the yoho valley reaching
 it via emerald guides felt that manual labour was not in 7 their contract combined with the frequent mount forbes
 and bush pass bad weather these are at least a few of peyto gave up his own pack outfit busithe
 reasons why bill peyto began shower ness in 1908 and went to guide for the ing edward whymper with curses
 on a c p r and brewsters transport business pleasant july day by yoho lake perhaps he was not a
 good enough businessman to compete with the formidable a british cleric the rev james outrarn combination although he was not
 the only joined whymper s party during the yoho small outfitter to go out of business at this valley explorations
 he was an ardent time the era of major exploration in the climber and his desire to climb mount rockies
 was coming to an end and peyto assiniboine as yet unclimbed became seems to have guided no more parties as
 known to peyto outram did not have the illustrious as those of wilcox collie whymmeans for an extended trip but
 bill inspir per and outrarn ed him with the idea of going ahead by offering to pack him into assiniboine
 in nonetheless he continued to be a guide two days and return in less he also con and packer until
 1913 tourists were comvinced outram that the mountain was not ing in increasing numbers and many were a difficult task
 for a fit party as any party wealthy and adventurous enough to underinspired by outrarn would certainly be take fishing
 hunting or sight seeing trips with a pack outfit entries with peyto s as soon as whymper finished up in
 the name in a pack register still survive in yoho valley and went on to the ice river dicating for
 example that he guided a outram left field for banff on aug 31 fishing party to sawback lake twenty miles

 were spent in reconnoitring the southwest ridge ill defined and poorly enforced and during on peyto s suggestion and in
 caching food the long winters with no tourists around bill went as far as he could with them a packer

 the cabins fromi which hasler and christian bohren peyto and supplies were being stolen before entering his men spotted the
 climbers on the summit peyto threw stones in setting off a large at noon and welcomed them back with a
 animal trap said simpson if someone fiddle serenade the ascent had been made were caught in that he could die
 before just in time for the following day it snow long damn right he would replied bill ed as the
 party was leaving for banff then i d know for sure it was him outram hired peyto again in 1902

 peyto was at a time and he was confident he got left by conrad kain an austrian climi bing results
 on june 2 1916 however he was guide who came to the rockies in 1909 wounded in the thigh by
 a high explosive and was working with a 0 wheeler s shell later thinking back he reflected that boundary survey

 simpson pass his gun he probably would have been hit the two days when we worked at in the head
 however medical aid had peyto s camp on simpson pass were difficulty getting to the danger zone and most interesting

 someone comes to him in distress he finds a soft hearted man to the front replied peyto he thinks he

 he learned about this or a warning he often spent long periods peyto got off the train outside banff to
 in his district fighting forest fires clearing avoid the hero s welcome and was noticed trails and patrolling later digging

 by messrs fox and dietz delegates from iowa who are prospecting the north west under mr reilly s supervision both
 gentlemen are much pleased with the country especially from the lone pine to edmonton they drove out to st albert
 on tuesday and were very favorably impressed with the appearance of the harvest fields there and the samples of grain
 iowa is a very prosperous and wealthy state where the land is valued at from 50 an acre and upwards
 and where a large part of the farming population occupy rented land they would gladly exchange their condition of renters
 for that of owners but cannot purchase at the high price and therefore many are desirous of removing to a
 region where good and cheap land can be had formerly the overflow went to nebraska kansas or dakota these states
 have become discredited through bad seasons and people are now more willing to try the to them unknown north west

 having made hector ered that the expedition should have been second imi command of the party in any conducted in

 irregular proceeding i indians told him that they were glad that pointed out to lieu blakiston but said the great
 woman chief of the whites 1 would let that pass palliser then went queen victoria took compassion on on to
 remark that when he asked blakiston them and that they considered she was to give him a map of his
 route through the ignorant of the way in which white traders two passes the latter firmly refused much treated them
 they gave the indians very to palliser s surprise it appears that pal little goods and ammunition for their furs
 liser had intended to meet captain haw they went on to say that they were poor kins e on the
 boundary survey and had he but would work well for the white man known of blakiston s plans he could
 have blakiston in his report noted that the wesarranged his timetable accordingly palliser leyan missionaries had made some prosaid little
 else about blakiston s defection gress blakiston hoped to draw up a rehe may well have felt a sense of
 relief that port for the imperial government for he the man was leaving felt that some provision should be made
 blakiston had promised to carry out the for the poor uncivilized beings to whom explorations but his refusal to submit
 a by right the soil belongs sixteen years map to palliser indicated his resentmemmt were to pass before any treaty
 was made he felt he was no longer a member of the after his nieeting with the stonies blakexpedition and
 therefore had no need to iston continued on his way and noted that give pallisen anything in the attcr part

 the river near the crowsnest pass not far rest for packing as one of blakiston s pun from where the
 trunk road now joins highposes was mapping he noted that the chron way number 3 ometer his most valuable instrument
 was after crossing the oldman river blakisnever carried by the same man for two ton was obliged to ford the
 crowsnest river consecutive days for fear he might become careless which he termed the crow nest near the present site

 route for a railway over the watershed dividing it fromii that of through the mountains here he found a the
 highwood river in this journey he was narrow but well worn trail ascending toclosely following the route of the present

 wood river to its junction with trap creek kootenay pass where his description of in 36 l 7 4 w

 travelling in this way 18 and gradually ascending along the course of a small creek running into railway river which
 we had left where the trail parted from it this river was so named by me from the striking advantaged
 offered by its ‘ levels for the entry of a railway into the mountains we now rose rapidly and we
 soon reached the region of rock and i alpine plants as we were now clear of ‘ all shelter we
 felt the cold damp east wind which blew a fresh breeze and j i along the scudding clouds which pre
 vented any extensive view we were now on the watershed of america a few steps farther and i have a
 loud shout as i caught the first glimpse in a deep valley as it were my feet of a feeder
 of the pacific ocean it was the flathead river a tributary of the colurnbia at the same moment the shots
 of my men s guns echoing among the rocks announced the passage of the first white man over the kootanie
 pass i halted for the purpose of reading the barometer which showed an altitude of 5960 feet blakiston and his
 party themi descended the pacific slope of kootenay pass and i ultimately arrived in the valley of the flat 1
 head river they followed this river to its i headwaters and crossed the watershed separating it from the kootenay the
 trail led through dense bush and forest to a 1 rocky divide and then down a narrow steep zig zag
 trail to the valley of the wigwani captain john palliser left and sir james river blakiston and his men followed
 this hector were leaders of the famous exploring to its junction with the kootanie fork of expedition in the west
 blakision strongly disagreed with the way the expedition was the columbia as he descrmbed it they had run and eventually
 set off on his own now arrived at the junction of the elk river of which the wigwani is a
 tributary and with a kutenai guide once again he crossthe kootenay not far from wardner b c ed the flathead
 valley and commenced to froni there they proceeded south to to ascent the divide the party was soon on bacco
 plains where they met some of the top of boundary pass as it is now known kutenai indians who inhabited
 the region and crossing into canadian territory des blakiston was impressed with the kutenai cended through the woods and due
 east whom he said were all baptized roman down a valley which ultimately widened catholics at the encampment were two

 of and a priest had visited them that spring land grade flora and fauna meticulously he also noted that they
 did not beg as did noting everything he finally observed that other indians after two hours of travelling on level
 ground along red stone creek we emerged while halted at their encampment blak on the saskatchewan plain just six geoiston
 learned from them of a pass which graphical miles north of the 49 parallel they used to cross the mountains
 to hunt and camimed at waterton lakes two miles buffalo this was said to conic out on the east of
 the mouth of the ass plains near chief mountain although blakiston was by now in american tern blakiston amid his
 companions were not tory he was determined to explore this pass only once again in british territory but also on
 his return and after a few days set off east of the continental divide they had 19 descended what is
 now known as blakiston the the fernie cranbrook area and to koot creek to the point where the road froni
 enay lake the present waterton townsite is joined by blakiston suninied up his findings in a that to crandell lake

 remained a few days at water the proceedings of the royal artillery inton lakes to rest the horses while there
 stitution he did not forward it to palliser he and his n men experienced a gale from as he was
 still at odds with the leader of the south west and he noted that this the expedition corner of the

 at fort edmonton and the ing much on the plain a strong breeze came following year returned to england where
 from the south down the gorge in which to his great relief he rejoined his regiment is the upper waterton
 lake 1 a fact to blakiston was not dcstimied to remain which many a tourist since can testify long in
 england in 1860 his regimlient was after resting their horses blakiston and ordered to china in connection with a civil
 his men travelled to ednionton on what war prevailing in that country at the time was to be blakiston s
 honieward journey this was merely to protect british imiterests blakiston had explored the kootenay and which were thought to be
 endangered by boundary passes but he did not comment the chaotic conditions blakiston by now very much on the latter
 as part of the a captain was stationed at canton route was in american territory he considered the kootenay pass
 niuch more suit at heart a restless individual blakiston able for a railway with its easy grades and could not
 remiiain idle for long at what he thought that tunnels could be constructed considered the boring husimiess of garrison if
 necessary he was at pains to point out duty at canton in 1 861 he therefore orthat he had said
 nothing about the suit ganized an expedition to explore the upper ability of the pass for a wagon road but
 reaches of the yangtze his object was merely noted that where one could build to ascend this river to its
 northern tributary a railroad a wagoii road could easily follow the mm and then cross szechwan province blakiston made a
 final note concerning to chengtu here he and his colleagues another pass hoped to obtain passports from the viceroy of
 tibet and cross to that country overland the crow nest pass of which i have marked the general direction on

 by report of the great journey overland to tibet and the natives it is a very bad road and india
 did not materialize as conditions in seldom used tibet were even worse than in china the in spite of blakiston
 s observations the viceroy could not guarantee the safety of crowsnest pass came to be the southern the party however
 blakiston did manage most route for both road and rail to carry out his exploration of the yangtze blakiston had
 examined an area previous he reached pingshan beyond the mouth of ly untraversed by europeans and brought the mm some
 900 niiles further up the to the notice of others the existence of a great river than any other westerner
 had new pass through the mountains suitable penetrated this brought him to a point for a railway his suggestions however
 sonic i 800 miles from shanghai were to conic to naught as the railway fol in his usual careful method
 he took lowed another route the discovery of coal notes and observations and accumulated a deposits in the crowsnest pass
 prompted vast amount of knowledge of the river his the building of the crowsnest branch of records included an amazingly
 accurate the c p r through that defile which was chart of the waterways particularly the lower than the kootenay

 on his side so they were close also took over the searle grain elevator together the barn had a good
 hayloft in in 1959 mr johnson purchased a servit so i guess that was the bedroom for the ice station

 of food for the trip this trunk at last april 1911 came and it was time by the way ended
 up as a cooler cementto go it was decided that ed ray and ed into the north end of the
 new kitchen i were to go with the box car johnnie and step which i built on our house at
 endiang my sister ida were to come later by passenger train ray having been a railroad the n machinery we
 loaded were two man knew all about such things so he wagons one with only a rack bed one ordered
 the car and planned the loading eight foot mccormack binder one rake we got a large sized car and after
 a week one mower and walking plow a 1 6 inch of taking machinery apart so it would load prairie
 breaker or sod buster we had albetter getting it hauled into la houre etc ways used this sort of plow
 to break sod we loaded it all in one end and put baled in dakota but after one year s
 use in alhay on top clear to the ceiling there was berta we purchased a sulky plow it was just
 enough room to crawl back to the end much easier to keep in the ground am md of the car
 and make a secret bed for two did a good job when it got a little dry we nien also
 purchased a disc and a drill later in alberta right near the door under this hay was our 36 inch
 wagon box on the floor of the we left la moure in the middle of the car with four calves
 in it also a barrel afternoon i think it was about the 5 th of full of water hung from
 the ceiling and april 1911 the northern pacific freight we had a chicken crate full of hens and train left
 us at the sheldon junction to be a rooster in the opposite end of the car picked up by the
 soo line which crosses we backed our four horse team of king at that point it was long after dark
 before and dan fred and kernel and put a 4 x the train was to pick us up as the
 car 4 across in front of them with a small was in my name i was sitting in there manger
 on it for hay and oats facing waiting but it was getting past my bedtime them was dexter ti me
 saddle horse and so i kept dozing off ed and ray were up three or four cows in our hidden
 bed and i guess they checked 24 a few times to see how i was getting along as the train
 was pulling out in a few mm after finding n me asleep several tines ray utes we got the horses
 out of the feed thought he d better take over which he barn loaded them and away we went on
 did to my delight he also took my name our last lap of the journey i can t recall from
 mi then on till we arrived in halkirk going through lacombe but i m sure we he was arthur johnston
 did along son mewhere near alix or tees the three of us were sittimig near the south the son hmie
 train finally picked us up door sunning ourselves on a beautiful afterand after a stop in enderlin they rumbled noon
 when a face peeked from the top of on all night 1 was having a good sleep ti me car
 and wanted to know how come till about 5 or 6 o clock next mornmng whemi there were three of
 us with this car when there was a territic crash ed and i rolled only one was allowed that trouble
 was out of bed to see what happened ray had fixed up with a dollar or two been sittmng on
 a turned over pail milkmng a cow and the cow sort of fell over on top we arrived in halkirk
 at the loading of him and nearly broke his neck at least platform about supper time and got the it
 mashed the pail he was sitting on we horses unloaded we put them in taylor were lucky we weren t
 up at the head of and derr s livery barn where they were the train as ti me first few
 cars were badly stabled quite often after that there was damaged the front car next to the loco still enough
 hay left to mi make a good bed motive was sn mashed in and several horses for the three of
 us next morning we were killed we learned that the engine had been up early unloaded the car set up
 the running low on water so they had unhook wagons and loaded up ready to pull out ed froni the
 train and run ahead to the by the mi middle of the afternoon 1 tl iink we next station to
 fill up perhaps they had led one cow and the others followed of filled more than the engine tender and
 did course the calves and chickens were in one n t realize how fast they were travelling wagon besides a
 lot of other stuff when they hit the traimi which was stand we were on our way to the homesteads
 ing still this happened somewhere near kenniare or bowbells in north dakota about the 10 th of april 1911 about
 three miles south of halkmrk we caught up to we got into portal and there we went a man who
 had unloaded the samiie night through customs where we had to unload we had he had left earlier with his
 three the horses as they had to be checked for oxen and i guess they were thirsty and glanders i
 think we stayed overnight there pulled into the middle of a little slough and got on our way again next
 morning for a drink they were young oxen just it seems to me it took two days to get to
 broke to drive and wouldn t pull the load calgary where they had to break up the out so we
 hitched king amid dan on in train and do a lot of shunting of cars front and got them back
 on the trail then while doing this they hit our car so hard we found out the settler was arthur
 james that the four horses banged against the on his way to endiang too 4 x 4 and broke it
 loose the chicken crate came down and there were horses cows it clouded over and got dark early that and
 chickens all mixed up ed flew out evening so we looked for a place to stop the door and let
 them have it of course for the night we got to the old weaver the brakeman claimed there was a
 faulty place on the hill by the coulee they let brake on our car us stop am md put sonic
 stock in the stable but there was no place for us in the little anyway they finally got the train
 made tarpapered shack so we made the best of up for the north so we were on our way it

 when the man cleaned his to unload the horses as there was a delay stables he piled it all in
 an empty stall and in trains going to haikirk we had gotten that is where we parked for the night

 the edison waragraph company presented a large number of scenes and moving pictures to a fair audience last night the
 views with the exception of a few were very plain and could be spoken of as eclipsing anything of their
 nature ever shown here before after opening with a few pictures of scenes in pretoria durban and other cities connected
 with the british boer war the funeral of queen victoria was then brought on in this could be seen many
 mioted personages such as kim mg edward the emperor of germnany and others as well as representatives from different foreign
 countries this view although somewhat dim in sonic parts was very good and from it one could conceive something of
 the rnagmiificence and grandeur of the affair besides a bird s eye view of the paris exposition other interesting scenes
 at the exposition were shown a large and varied selection of comic pictures aniong which were a trip to the
 moon lovers interrupted the tricky donkey the haunted house and the one man orchestra created much laughter and amusement scenes
 in south africa relating to the bnitish boer war were looked upon with interest m j noel the famous parisian
 specialty artist impersonating a female drew forth much applause another scene which was greatly appreciated by the audience was that
