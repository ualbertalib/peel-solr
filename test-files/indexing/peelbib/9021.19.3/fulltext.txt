 postage guaranteed timber tom and the north west rebellion by david h breen as tension quickened in the canadian north
 west through the winter of 1884 85 the obdurate red man became the great imponderable the previous two decades of
 metis restlessness had brought about a certain wariness on the part of the white settlers but while past experience did
 not rule out armed conflict there was general consensus among western residents that if given secure land titles the metis
 would remain peaceful the turn of events beginning in late march 1885 proved however that the metis question had not
 been resolved in face of federal intransigence the metis had determined to seek redress through force of arms by the
 middle of april the situation appeared bleak at every hand the rebels had met with success at duck lake canton
 frog lake and fort pitt the white man and the mounted police had been defeated many observers speculated that these
 initial successes would bring the vast majority of indians who had hitherto remained uncommitted into the rebellion local officials had

 quiet settlers awaited news of the indian during the next twelve months the response to the metis initiative in a
 many reports that subsequently followed state near panic fearing the worst and from superintendent crozier at battle alive to every
 wild rumour it is evident ford confirmed this prediction in july and for that matter hardly surprising crazier informed his
 superiors of meet that the concern of most alberta resiings between the half breeds and dents lay not so much
 with riel s pro indians at duck lake and prince albert gress or with the local metis groups as and
 by november he had come to the with the nearby indian population the same conclusion already reported to feelings of
 alarm uncertainty and dewdney by rouleau the indians especially isolation experienced by crozier said were in a destitute con western
 settlers as they awaited the dition and if no help was forthcoming red man s decision is well illustrated he
 predicted some would come to in a series of letters sent during the grief the consequent grief that rebellion from
 edmonton by the crown would certainly fall upon the govern timber agent thomas timber tom ment if the situation was
 allowed to get anderson to his superiors in ottawa out of hand was clearly implied but on april 9 th
 using the rather lame the lieutenant governor persisted till pretext of officially informing the departspring in playing the situation down

 correct the man operations characteristic of the fact remains however that while the north west that eagerly accepted copy tenor
 of the reports may be discounted from whatever source as alarmist they do truly reflect the these reports probably reinforced
 the high state of popular excitement existent folk tales which newly arrived settlers in the west it is apparent moreover
 from the east had heard as youngsters that this anxiety was directed almost on the knee of their grandparents and
 entirely toward the indian population helped create a climate in which the anderson s letters for example make feelings of
 isolation was intensified and scarcely any mention of the metis while where the wildest rumour could gain in calgary the
 indians could logically credence in this sense the irrepressible be construed as the only potential threat anxiety of individuals such
 as the crown there was in the vicinity of edmonton timber agent in edmonton or the frantic a sizable metis
 population and yet here overreaction of certain calgary citizens too the overriding fear was of the was the product of
 a real concern in face indians of apprehended danger that was corn there seems reason to suggest that pounded by

 tried before mayor mccauley on tuesday this was a case of disturbing religious services the disturbance consisting of singing out
 of harmony with the congregation in a manner that was annoying to the worshippers some of the witnesses swore that
 they were obliged to leave the meeting on account of the inharmonic noises made by the defendant while others swore
 that his singing was not disagreeable to them the weight of evidence seemed to prove that mr morley s voice
 was not melodious upon this occasion and the mayor therefore imposed a fine of one dollar disallowing all witness fees

 lakes looking for a place to brother in law ten years later mobley start trading i selected a point on
 the afterwards went to atlin lake in northern spotted creek about a mile from where british columbia and became member

 bers of jackfish and suckers in this creek named jack who was a prince to travel and consumed large quantities
 of gull with he was a blacksmith and wood eggs which they got in spotted lake worker by trade personifying
 good this lake is all dotted with rushes and nature and was an exceedingly valuable when viewed from an elevation
 it has man to have with a party if anything a spotted appearance i have eaten broke down many gull
 eggs myself and used to make we reached the grand rapids 160 custards from them the eggs were a miles
 down the athabasca from the little strong but not bad thousands landing and stopped on an island the of gulls
 nested there annually and in hudson s bay co had a push car tramthe morning you would be wakened by
 way on this island so we moved our the noise they made when settlers came cargo to the lower end
 of it in the in they robbed the gulls eggs so much meantime our boat had been let down that
 the gulls left it completely the on the east side to the foot of the island 14 storage sheds dominated
 the landscape at athabasca landing during its period as a terminus on the water route to the north this view
 in 1899 shows a few buildings with the anglican church second from the right where she was reloaded and we
 started course we were green at this our for mcmurray there were 70 miles of steersman was congratulating us on
 the rapids and swift water we came one good run we had made around this night to the head of
 what is known as point but he neglected to tie our boat the boiler rapids so called because a to
 the ring mobley and billy mcleod steamboat boiler that the hudson s bay our interpreter were in the boat first
 co was taking north was lost in these thing we noticed our boat had moved rapids camped there also that
 night out to the falls and we couldn t get her were two hudson s bay boats and an back
 and she went over the cascade other belonging to peter loutit who was sideways the undertow below the fall his
 own steersman in the morning the drew her back until she was up against two hudson s bay boats piled
 up on the fall the sweep was caught by the the rock peter loutit pulled out next fall and hit
 mobley throwing him overand he lost his sweep but got through board between the boat and the fall without breaking
 his boat our men he came up and fortunately was able pulled out around the outfit and we got to
 fold his arms over the gunwhale but through all right we immediately the fall of the water was striking his
 landed when we got through the rapids back and he said it was like niagara and went back to help
 those other boats we still had the rope we had used to we pulled them ashore the cargo was line
 her down to the head of the cascade removed and the boats were repaired and of course we began pulling
 on this and reloaded everything was wet rope it apparently got caught once on through one of the rowlocks and
 when it slipped another bad place on the river was off we thought the thing had broken but the big
 cascade this is where we had finally the line got taut again and we to let the boat down by
 rope and just pulled them out there was no harm over the cascade there was an iron done particularly but
 it was very excitring in the rock the boat was supposed ing and very dangerous to be tied to this
 iron ring and the cargo we continued on from mcmurray packed just past the cascade of down to fort chipewyan
 going around 15 goose island we went out through we finally got down to the mouth stony river to the
 great slave river of the slave river where it empties into and the current of this river was in our
 slave lake with a very strong wind favour at another time when the peace blowing over the land and from
 there was higher than lake athabasca i came to the snye which is a short cut into through this river
 when there was a fort resolution we had to row from reverse current here to keep from blowing out to
 sea i remember i broke one of those big we arrived at smith s landing now fitzgerald here we engaged
 a pilot for sweeps rowing what is known as the smith rapids we arrived at fort resolution and this pilot
 was susie beaulieu we were welcomed by ed nagle of the firm also hired twenty half breeds and of hyslop
 and nagle i had known indians to work on the four portages hyslop in ‘ 77 and ‘ 78 when
 he was that were between smith s landing and acting as assistant engineer on the con fort smith one of
 these portages is a struction of the pembina branch between mile and a quarter long on all the emerson and
 st boniface nagle inportages our boats had to be pulled by vited both crews to dinner that night main strength
 and awkwardness across and we had new potatoes and cariboo the portage and the goods packed on tongue which is
 the most delicious meat the men s backs we crossed the slave i ever ate these cariboo tongues were river
 between two big falls just above traded for at fort rae across the great the last portage that is the
 mountain slave lake mr camsell who was then portage which rises 160 feet above the in charge of the mackenzie
 district for river we all packed on this portage the hudson s bay co and lived at fort i picked
 my own pack a 28 pound simpson told me that when he first went caddy of tobacco to which the
 pack to the mackenzie they had traded as strap was attached was placed on my many as 7 000 cariboo
 tongues back with the strap on the forehead it was now september 1896 we and 100 pounds of flour thrown
 between pulled out of resolution with a nice the back of my neck and the caddy of breeze and got
 out some distance when tobacco at mountain portage i under it turned out to be a gale we had took
 to pack four bear traps which are to keel on our boat and were in danger a very awkward load
 and going down of being swept against the rocks howon the other side my neck got a kink i ever
 we escaped the rocks and reached had to get rid of my pack and have green island where we remained
 for a never packed since day on this island there was every kind of wild fruit grown in the north
 just above fort smith there are a large number of rocky islets on these country cherries raspberries strawislets the pelicans
 nest this is prob berries gooseberries dewberries currants etc we pulled away from green ably the largest nesting place of
 pelicans island and landed on another island in the north in the channels between some distance from there where the
 the islets there are numerous small fish on which the pelicans live the eggs partridges were as thick as hens
 around are laid on the bare rock without nests some barnyards leaving that island we coasted along the south shore
 of i have never eaten pelican eggs and great slave lake we spent one night do not think i would
 although they say at a little harbour beyond what was that the eggs of all birds are fit for food
 called dead man s island now called below fort smith we called at the pine point there had been a
 fight mouth of the salt river where some there a long time ago between natives half breeds were camped who
 had salt and a large number of men were killed for sale from the salt springs this salt so that
 was the reason it got the name is coarse and is quite pure i showed dead man s island a
 sample of it to the dominion minister we continued along the south shore of public works who said it was
 a to sulphur point our interpreter billy remarkably fine salt mcleod was steering and there was a 16 big sea
 on though not a choppy one we succeeded on our third attempt and he kept hugging the shore too closely
 got away and we went a short distance so i advised him to keep out from it to sandy creek
 which is a splendid because our rudder stuck below the fishing place and stayed there for a day keel and
 might be torn off if it touched fishing with fish nets i saw by the map the ground this happened
 and we we had with us that we were about drifted away into buffalo bay we got seven miles from
 the mouth of hay some kind of a steering apparatus rigged river so frank mobley and i walked up but
 we could not make it past the along the shore to the settlement we next point which is sandy point
 on emerged from the timber at the back account of the wind blowing us to shore of the anglican mission
 and a half we had two cases of the old sulphur breed girl who was at the mission saw matches
 and a peterborough canoe along us and ran for dear life because at that with us so i launched this
 canoe and time they did not see any more than put the two boxes of matches in it and three
 or four strangers all year the went ashore followed closely by the big indians there were strong believers in boat
 which struck a sand bar and the the weetigo and she may have thought crew simply jumped off on to
 the sand we were spirits the girl ran in to tell bar and lifted on the boat and she miss
 marsh afterwards my wife and cleared the bar and landed on the main miss timms and rev tom marsh who
 land inside the bar it was quite cool came out and welcomed us in weetigo and there is probably more
 driftwood or no weetigo and that was where i piled along the south shore of great first met my future
 wife we were wind slave lake than any place i ever had bound there for eleven days and had a
 knowledge of so we built a large fire very good time we finally got away and we had a 5
 gallon keg of rum which and crossed the lake from hay river had never been touched and it was post
 and desmarais islands to where tapped as we were all wet to the neck the mackenzie river leaves the lake
 and cold pack called this keg the this was about the first of october i keg of conversation because everybody
 can remember it was a beautiful day started quite a conversation around this we passed fort providence crossed big fire
 we had what is now called mills lake and came we made three attempts to get away to the head
 of the line just below from that place we built a raft on the that we saw a moose on
 the shore and bar outside and took some of the goods mcleod went out with the canoe but of this
 boat and put them on the raft did not get any moose this would be so as to lighten the
 boat over the bar about the third or fourth of october we the anglican church was one of the main
 buildings in hay river for many years even by 1930 when this photo was taken the settlement was still an
 isolated northern outpost 17 had a slight snowfall just before this the indians had had some misunderand it was pretty
 cold with quite a fog standing that spring with tim gaudet on the river anyway just below the who was
 in charge for the hudson s head of the line we tied our boat up bay at fort wrigley he
 had for a clerk and crawled under the canvas leaving a young east indian man named hardnobody on watch that
 night we drifted ing son of a british army officer a very about sixty miles to fort simpson when fine
 character and a good singer our we awakened we were just nearly op fall fur trade had not amounted to
 much posite the gros cap in the v formed and no number of indians came in until by the junction
 of the liard and the nearly new year s and then they were mackenzie we pulled in to land at
 starving some time before christmas fort simpson mr camsell in charge we dispatched mcleod out into the of the mackenzie
 district asked us to mountains west of the mackenzie river the big house and regaled us with to visit some
 indians who were out there some good coffee and solid refreshments they were the ones who had left in a
 our original intention was to go to fort huff that year from the hudson s bay liard for the winter
 but hearing reports post at wrigley without any ammuniof low water and difficult navi gation tion it was usual for
 the company to on the liard and also hearing of a good give them free ammunition in the spring fur
 catch the previous winter at wrigley on account of this dispute they went we changed our minds and decided to
 away without it and when mcleod got go there to them they had all kinds of meat we pulled out
 from simpson and moose bear bighorn sheep and lots the first night thought we would drift of dried meat which
 they had snared but when we wakened up in the morn when he came back three of these ing we
 were lined up against an island indians accompanied him and they where we had remained until wakened brought 600 pounds
 worth of fur two in the morning we had just passed dog sled loads of dried meat and a fort
 wrigley post about a quarter of number of bladders of bear grease all a mile and pulled from there and
 saw this food had been collected without there was sufficient timber to build with any firearms they stayed with us
 a and when we tore the moss away we couple of nights and they had no articles struck the eternal
 ice we built a shack of european dress on them they had for the three of us that is mott
 mcleod moccasins socks and shirts of rabbits and myself mcleod afterwards went up skin the skins had been cut in
 strips the south nahanni river with his brother and woven together to make these gar frank and another white man
 and they ments goatskin leggings with the fur died up there about the time of the on the outside goatskin
 jacket with a klondike rush their bones were found capote to it rabbitskin mufflers and of later course mooseskin mitts
 in the shack we built a mud fire these indians were the lousiest men place we took three ladders one
 for we ever met i saw one take the vermin the back and one for each side and got off
 another and crack them in his teeth grass and mixed it up in the soft mud the hudson s bay
 and the traders and hung this grass over the rungs of allowed no stoves in their houses where the ladders
 so that they reached down they did their trading for fear of fire to the next rung afterwards the whole
 because they got only one outfit a year was smoothed off with a finishing coat and if that burnt up
 the year s trading of mud we had to move all the timber was gone and logs by hand a
 fourth man on all travelling was done by moonour party was john burke who was light or starlight the stars
 just filled picked up in edmonton he was a splen the sky the reason for this was that did character
 honest never tiring and they had to have the daylight for maknever out of humour he worked his ing camp
 and they did not do any passage with us burke spent the winter chopping except in daylight for fear of
 about seven miles below our camp accidents 18 i sold out my interest to my partner david hanbury came to
 wrigley mott on new year s for what fur we when we were there in march intending had he keeping
 the rest of the outfit to cross the mountains to the yukon just i then went down to spend the
 winter for pleasure he got out about eighty with burke who was living in a deserted miles and could not
 get any further so indian shack on the back of the river he returned to wrigley i had an uncle
 this shack had a fireplace in it but there in the east who was a manufacturer of were several holes
 in the wall and the clothing and i knew that when burke weather was severe as mackenzie win and i
 got to edmonton we would be ters are i carried water up from the pretty ragged and would need some
 river and spattered it all over the shack clothes a tailor in eastern ontario had and sealed it up air
 tight and we were my measurement where a cousin of as snug as the proverbial bug in a rug mine
 lived i sent a letter by hanbury i used to take a run around burke s to this cousin to
 have a suit of clothes trap line for exercise i started out one for me also giving him burke s
 measuremorning for about a 10 mile run on this ments and asked him to send the two line and as
 i went down along the suits out to edmonton so they would be river for a distance i saw something
 there when we reached edmonton the black where he had a trap set i thought next fall hanbury went up
 the liard it was a black fox but when i came as far as he could on the ice and
 got to closer i saw it was a wolverine of fort liard when the ice broke up he course when
 i got close to this wolverine had come in that way by canoeing from it started to run i had
 nothing but an dease lake he went out by dease lake axe with me and i ran that wolverine and
 down the stikine to the pacific where for about three miles when i rested he probably mailed my letter to
 my it rested and when i ran it ran he cousin in the east and when i got to played
 me out and i had to let him go edmonton they told me at the hotel there if you take
 a wolverine fur to an eskimo were clothes for me you get a good price for it as he uses
 we started on the 7 th of june from it for trimming the breath does not wrigley for athabasca landing
 with freeze on this fur this skiff one on the skiff and one on in march burke and i broke
 camp shore tracking hour about the next and we moved up to wrigley and morning we got up and got
 ready to start camped out and built a skiff to come and a wind came up and it rained so
 out with we whipsawed lumber to we just stuck to that boat for grim make a medium sized clinker built
 skiff death until we were nearly perished and we used small spruce for ribs for it with the cold as
 we were making such and very few nails could be got so we good time we must have gone 75
 miles broke up all the boxes we could find that day up stream we passed around to get the nails
 out of them the big bend opposite camsell mountain at the mouth of the north nahanni be between 12 o
 clock and 1 o clock tween there and simpson we were held at night harding came to our camp and
 up over a day with ice coming down marked out the letters for a name for and we reached simpson

 th of june horseback riding the first thing that strikes the visitor to our town next to the scenery is
 the general indulgence of the citizens in the healthful and enjoyable recreation of horseback riding we think we are safe
 in saying there is more riding done in calgary than any other place in canada not excepting the cities and
 the reason is not far to seek a very good saddle horse can be bought at from 70 up and
 the keep is a mere bagatelle persons known as herdsmen make a business of pasturing horses on the ranges of
 luxuriant grass which surround us on every side they keep a watch on the band night and day and bring
 any particular horse in whenever required for which they charge only 3 per month by this arrangement all the drudgery
 of grooming watering etc is done away with and the temptation to possess a source of pleasure to which so
 little expense and trouble is connected is one which few can resist as a consequence almost everybody is the happy
 owner of a horse even the indian sports his cayuse in addition to those who ride for pleasure we have
 one hundred mounted police and from thirty to fifty cowboys whose business it is to ride and who may be

 made our beds that night under the ramp of an elevator in crossfield the first day of november was colder
 with large wedges of geese honking their way in the blue sky as if they had important business in some
 southern clime but our business was northward looking for our place to roost before winter set in it was near
 dark when we drove into a clump of poplar trees west of the old farmer s home cafe in innisfail
 and pitched our tent it seemed good to see rivers and trees after leaving the parched prairie in the ninth
