 prohibition legislation in parts of canada and the united states denoted an era in the continent s history when man
 s idealism outweighed his logic this dry idealism was nourished by the impact of industrialism on a once agrarian continent
 where the need for social reform was most evident it was from the urban areas that the desire for social
 reform began and the consumption of liquor was dubbed as one of the causes of social problems from the urban
 areas it was carried about america by the rural evangelical virus through men who complemented and preached the aspirations of
 the temperance groups the movement reached alberta when the province was in its infancy and the social and economic problems
 associated with settlement demanded an appraisal of the existing conditions it was only natural that such a review would come
 from the rural areas and that the farmer organizations would be the means to bring about such an appraisal this
 paper will attempt to relate two areas two years later a group of two significant aspects of that era the
 interested temperance reformers assemrise of the prohibition movement in bled in red deer to form the alberta alberta and its
 relationship to the united temperance and moral reform league farmers of alberta and to show why declaring the purpose of
 their league the latter went on record in the support to be of the former to promote by educational aggressive
 with the formation of the provinces effort the growth of temperance sentiment of alberta and saskatchewan in 1905 and habit

 shandro school by anna navalkowski the story is a plain one and must be plainly told the setting lacks drama
 unless one wants to think of the romantic atmosphere of the pioneer west that wide expanse of fertile land that
 has many stories to tell one must imagine a community that was carved out of the wilderness by people who
 came to western canada with practically nothing but courage and sheer determination to make an honest living and within seven
 years of their coming to canada a school district was organized when few if any of them spoke english well
 to understand how the school came into being one must know something of the people who came and started the
 shandro community these pioneers lived in russ banilla a village in bukowina which was under austrian rule the impoverished lives
 of these people was 1 j jj ‘ j 3 caused mainly by a shortage of land they had tilled
 the soil but peasant ‘ 2 holdings were limited due to the feudal ‘ system and to the continuous growth
 of population there was a hunger for land with no opportunities for expansion and no hope of ever improving their
 lot a source of encouragement to these shandro school decorated and landscaped for prospective settlers came from the gov arbor
 day 1932 ernment of canada in 1896 the new liberal government which came into once they left they would never
 come power was faced with the problem of back and anything that was dear to populating the western prairies and
 them was left behind forever it took sought mass immigration from central three weeks to cross the atlantic ocean europe
 an immigration agency was and one april day 1899 they landed established in bukowina and when the in halifax the
 immigrants came into discontented peasants learned that far canada recorded under many different across the atlantic ocean in canada one
 names other than galician or austrian could get 160 acres of land for 10 00 the shandro brothers and their
 group it did not take them long to arrive at came from the territory under austrian the decision to migrate
 the prospect of rule and they were listed as ruthenians land employment and high wages be at the immigration office
 in halifax came the propaganda of the agents and after docking at halifax the group this enticed them with a
 determination undertook the long tiresome journey by that canada was their promised land train to the western prairies the can
 in a short time they sold what little adiari pacific railway was interested property they had in their native in
 placing immigrants in unopened areas bukowina and arranged for passage to with hope that these settlers would canada although they
 desired to move eventually prosper and require tools to a new country it took courage and machines etc and this
 meant the use depleted resources to leave their place of railroad freight service they arrived of birth instinctively they realized

 settlers they knew of some ukrainian families made great strides it was a common who had settled at star in
 1897 and occurrence that the homestead would be decided to follow the victoria trail until left in care of the

 train in camp on its way to macleod they took the liberty of going through it for provisions and ammunition
 to the amount of about 200 while the men were asleep a quantity of whiskey in the same wagon with
 the goods stolen was left untouched but a trunk belonging to a lady on her way to fort macleod to
 be married was pillaged mercilessly early in may a party of crees from cypress hills stole horses from the bloods
 on belly river a small war party started out and caught up to the crees but in the fight that
 ensued the bloods were defeated one of the party being killed and another wounded so badly that he died shortly
 after he got home the cypress crees encouraged by the success of their former raid made another expedition against the
 bloods and got away with another large band of horses a few of the bicods came to fort macleod and
 complained to capt denny indian agent of the theft and asked provisions and assistance from the police in order to
 look up and recover the stolen stock the agent gave them provisions and sent a request to the police at
 cypress to assist them in recovering their horses instead of a few of them going peaceably however a war party

 recollections by roy w hay in 1910 heeding the prevalent slogan young man go west i left marvelville ontario on
 a harvesters excursion on august 9 th and landed at sedley sask about 36 miles east of regina i worked
 there through the harvest and did some fall ploughing before freeze up my cousin william r mcewen had to teach
 and we went together arriving come west around 1906 and had taken in vermilion on july 29 th 1911 i
 filed land in alberta between irma and on my homestead and jessie went to see mannville so after finishing work
 at mr parker the school inspector she sedley i went to visit him and landed was hired to teach at
 landonville some in mannville on nov 9 th he had three thirty or forty miles north of vermilion quarters a
 south african veteran s i took the train to mannville and hired scrip which he had purchased and his a
 livery to take me and my trunk to the homestead the southeast quarter in his homestead where there was a
 small section 14 48 9 w 4 had been filed on shack and a dry well thirty six feet but
 was not being improved and was deep with a square crib made of lumliable for cancellation i went to the
 ber the shack was later moved to a land office in innisfree and placed a different location and it was
 decided cancellation on it before going back to dig another well using the cribbing east for christmas from the dry
 one already dug some time later i received notice i bought four oxen from edward from the land office that
 my cancella webb and a sixteen inch sulky breaktion was granted and i had until july ing plow from eatons
 but did not do 29 th 1911 to file on the quarter as my any breaking until 1912 willie had
 a homestead this would be about two crop in 1911 about sixty acres but weeks before the harvesters excursions the
 wheat was quite badly frozen and would start when i could get out west was graded as feed i helped
 him with for 10 if i could get the date extended harvest and hired with marks brothers two weeks or
 so it would save me about as fireman at 2 50 per day for the 40 a large sum in
 those days the threshing season they had a big case hon frank oliver was minister of the steam outfit interior
 in laurier s cabinet at that time and homestead regulations were part of it was the custom in alberta at
 this his responsibility so i went in to time to close the schools in the winter ottawa to interview him
 a daring and rather than taking summer holidays presumptuous thing as i thought of it jessie s school followed this
 custom and afterwards for an unsophisticated lad of she wanted willie to go home with her twenty one however he
 listened at for christmas at first he did not think tentatively to my story and then said he could go
 as he had promised to help well my young man if you want that robert conn to dig a well
 and also he homestead you better get out and get was to dig mine but after some perit i did
 want that homestead so i got suasion by telling him i could help the 40 somehow and took the train
 at conn and he could dig mine when he ottawa came back he decided to go little did we know
 what was coming or surely willie mcewen s sister jessie a we would have done it differently but school teacher
 had decided to go west that was not to be mr hay is now a resident of mannville the paper
 was submitted by his nedhew eldon b hay of mount allison university sackville nb 26 by march 12 th i
 had dug my well i went back east before christmas down as far as i could until we needed and
 on jan 14 th 1914 i was united cribbing and then we started to take in marriage with a school
 chum myrtle the lumber out of my dry well robert enid brunton after a busy round of conn was helping
 us willie went down visiting and celebrations with our many in the well on the rope attached to a friends
 and relations we arrived in irma windlass which i was handling at the in early march we came out to
 the top while conn pulled up the lumber homestead with joseph fleming who that willie tied to another rope we
 was mail driver and postmaster at zoldhad about six or eight feet of the crib ovara in his own homestead
 at nw bring up when all at once willie said 2 48 9 w 4 we had supper with his
 pull up roy pull up i did so im family after which he took us over to mediately but in
 seconds there was ten our homestead mr conn also had been feet of sand and gravel over him the married
 while i was away and he and cribbing had collapsed and the gravel his wife emma were at our place
 to ran in like water welcome us it took almost four days to get willie s body out of the
 well we had to get then came the war years with so lumber and a new crib built and all
 many of our friends and neighbors jointhe time the gravel kept running in ing the armed forces some never to
 with the danger that someone else would return my father had purchased the be buried during this time we had
 mcewen land from the family in the generous help from all our neighbors east and now we had a whole
 section to farm in 1918 we had a disastrous corn and i farmed together for sev frost in july which
 froze all our crops eral years after willie s death we and we had little or nothing to thresh worked
 his land on shares along with we had to purchase all our seed the our own homesteads i built a
 sod stable next spring with oats at 1 00 per bushel and sod shack and went threshing again and wheat
 2 00 high prices for those with marks brothers after harvest we had decided to invest in cattle and so
 days when threshing was over i went back in 1918 or ‘ 19 the municipal district east to purchase a
 carload after about of buffalo coulee was formed and after two months i loaded thirty four head of the first
 year i took on the job of auditdairy cattle and a young mare a gift ing their books then when
 the secfrom my father and arrived in mann retary of the district passed away in yule in february 1913 it
 was a nice 1931 the council accepted my applicawarm day but before we got the cattle tion and the office
 was moved to my home the mercury had dropped 50 homestead i built on an extra room for degrees with
 a strong wind and drifting the purpose and started as secretarysnow we had a difficult time and suf treasurer on
 jan 1 st 1932 ten years fered some loss of cattle however we later several districts were amalgamsaved a good
 number of milch cows ated and i became assistant secretary at some of which we sold to joe fleming mannville
 and was secretary from 1954 hartley baldwin and james findlay until i retired in 1963 robert conn and i milked
 a few and shipped cream i broke about thirty in spite of the tragedy in the early acres on my
 homestead and percy years in the loss of my cousin and in kinson whose homestead was on se spite of
 drouth and sometimes poor crops 28 48 9 w 4 built a fence around my and some sickness on the
 whole we had place in exchange for breaking i also a happy life on our homestead we built an addition

 firm does by far of the best building stone a town hall the project of building a public hall at
 edmonton has met with every encouragement so far sufficient land has been offered on which to place the building and
 offers of money material and labor have also been made still a great deal remains to be done before a
 suitable building can be procured a hall of reasonable size say 30 x 50 would cost about one thousand dollars
 the necessity for such a building is urgent at the present time and daily becoming more so there are many
 measures that could be taken for the welfare and advancement of the country if it were possible for the people
 of the different sections to meet and exchange opinions freely and the fact of their meeting together and having a
 place of meeting in common would do much to destroy that sectional feeling which exists to a slight extent at
 present and would help to induce all parties to make common cause for the common goal the present necessity of
 a hall is shown in the case of the agricultural society for want of a place of meeting and a
 suitable building to hold a show in the society is practically dead this is not as it should be and
 it is the duty of every man who has his own interest and also that of this section of the
 country at heart to do what he can to forward this undertaking either in money material or labor so that
 when it is necessary for the people to make their voice heard on any subject or to unite for any
 purpose whatever the good that might be done will not be lost merely through the want of a place of
