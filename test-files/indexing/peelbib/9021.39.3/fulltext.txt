 of the most interesting meetings in western canadian history took place on january 13 1848 when paul kane travelling across
 british north america to make a pictorial record of the native peoples met maskipiton or broken arm a cree chief
 well known to history as guide peacemaker and traveller the conversation recorded by kane revealed maskipiton as one who could
 take an objective look at the work of the christian missionaries among his people one 1 can only wonder if
 maskipiton told kane other things about himself which kane might have found even more remarkable where did paul kane meet

 make a reasonable conjecture about the question 2 kane left fort edmonton on january 8 1848 travelling with the wedding

 this study draws on the work of walter l buenger and joseph a pratt 2 their approach with its emphasis

 need to shed light upon this issue and the surviving records of the bank make this possible little has been
 done to trace the interaction of finan cial and economic forces in alberta according to the standard interpretation as reflected
 in james g macgregor s history of alberta the situation in the province was characterized by antagonism between the large
 eastern banks and the farm ers 5 other variations let farming stand for most of alberta economic enterprise however the
 reality in the case of the canadian bank of com merce during the first decade of the twentieth century was
 quite different ‘ i he picture was ob viously complex but one of the most striking features was that the
 calgary branch was in a relationship of mutual reliance and mutual ben efit with the regional economy to place the

 vick the life of george harcourt was woven imito the fabric of prairies at a time when canada was entering
 the 20 th century his contributions were largely in the fields of agricultum e and horticulture on the one hand
 he was a thrifty quiet considerate and modest man on the other he was a tireless entrepreneur always enthusiastic and
 occasionally rash these combined charac teristics provided inspiration to many of his con temporaries and made harcourt one of the
 great canadians of his time george harcourt was born on november 3 1864 not far from guelph in rural ontario
 he was not one to let the grass grown under his feet as can be seen fm om the following
 account of his early years quoted from the canadian album of 1894 mr harcourt spent the first sevemi years of
 his fife omi a farm the next four in toronto the next five in preston and at sixteen having received
 a good primary education returned to his father s farm when 23 years of age he entered the ontario agricultural
 college at guelph to learn more about the occupatiomi he was follow inn he led his class from ihe start
 and in two eorge harcourt years carried off the gold medal for general proficiency not content wilh this he spent

 dates fixed for the negotiation of the indian treaties in the athabasca and peace river districts next spring it is
 stated that the time intervening between the dates fixed for meeting the indians at the various points is barely sufficient
 to allow of the commissioners moving from one place to the other and makes no allowance for delay in the
 negotiations as these are a different race of indians from those already treated with it is fair to suppose that
 least as much time will be taken up in preliminary talk especially when the half breed scrip has to be
 arranged for at the same time as a matter of fact the chipewyans and beavers are much more difficult to
 bargain with than the crees and in all probability will require much longer to close the deal with if the
 commissioners are delayed at any one point either by the non arrival of the indians or by delay in negotiations
 they cannot keep their appointments at other points this will be looked upon by the indians as a breach of
 faith and will render treaty making all the more difficult besides it will add very materially to the cost of
 the negotiations if the indians come in at a certain time and the commissioners are not there to meet them
 they must be fed at government expense until the commissioners come or they will in all probability leave for the
 woods again as none of them have supplies ahead these are the facts as stated by practical men and the
 government would do well to revise their dates so as to make due allowance for delays better have the commission
 with nothing to do for a few days than have a number of bands of angry and hungry indians to
 feed and deal with the government has seen fit to send word to the indians of their desire to treat
 with them in a most informal manner that is by verbal communications to hudson s bay officers missionaries and others
 it would be much better for the government to issue a printed circular containing the statements they desire to make
 and let that be placed in the hands of all parties who can be reached and are able to read
 in the district affected in this way the information would be spread at first hand and if misleading reports got
 in circulation they could easily be contradicted it is particularly desirable that a good understanding should be arrived at with
 the half breeds of the district affected preliminary to the indian treaty as it is through their friendly offices the
 indians can best be reached edmonton bulletin aug 19 1898 25 do you remember the teacherage by john w chalmers

 seen through the eyes of a child the park advantages of alberta towns when one compares the advantages of alberta
 towns with those of towns in the other prairie provinces it is easily seen where the alberta towns have the
 better of the comparison one advantage that is obvious at this time of the year is in the fuel supply
 in saskatchewan and manitoba there are no coal mines producing good coal and as a consequence their fuel is brought
 from alberta on pennsylvania with the result that the cost is from fifty to two hundred per cent greater than
 it is in alberta towns not only is the cost less hut the supply is handier and more adequate this
 is a very important matter not only fer householders hut for manufacturers municipal plants and other institutions requiring large supplies
 another advantage lies in the railway facilities alberta from standpoint of freight rates is midway between the atlantic and pacific
 seaboards and therefore has the great advantage of having a double seaport outlet this means more competition and better prices
 add to these the advantage of climatic conditions for though this winter has proved that the weather can be severe
 at times the records show that on the whole the alberta climate is very much more moderate and healthful than
 that of the provinces to the east then too the location of the towns in the midst of varied resources
 and indtistries makes it easier for men to earn a livelihood and for towns to develop amid grow rapidly the
 people are not totally dependent on agriculture the towns are not merely market towns but they have mining close by
 often night in the town and lumbering operations ai e not far away from any of the towns these conditions
 make it easier for manufacturing establishments to operate at a pnofit and they in turn pnovide more work for the
 people taken altogether in no place in canada have the towns more advantages than they have in alberta and in
 no place should they grow more rapidly into large and prosperous cities the weslem n globe lacomnhe feb 22 1911

 they need any western canada has no occasion to import any grain or stock except possibly samples of seed for
 experiment and breeding stock therefore a tariff wall built to keep out foreign grain and stock cannot possibly be of
 any value to them lethbridge herald july 26 1910
