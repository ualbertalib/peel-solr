 court by frank gilbert roe i the prairie fires of may 1898 were almost epoch in the red deer canyon
 country they jumped the red deer river while slighter barriers were almost contemptuously ignored in a scrub and timber locality
 the thick pall of smoke blotted out local details from identification and rendered it difficult to detect their nearer or
 farther proximity or direction due to such confusions some men found themselves fighting dangers that were not immediate while other
 more vital fires might steal upon them from the flank or rear my mother and i were at this time
 resid entirely without protection if by any chance ing alone on the homestead ten miles east we were absent of
 blackfalds and neither of us had any cx on the sunday the billowing volumes of perience with prairie fires and
 their insidious smoke looked so threatening that we felt ways but i was soon to learn on saturday that some
 effort must be made immediately may 14 th 1 went down to my mother s the house stood at the
 de ouc mcnt or homestead to plough a small field the outfall of a small narrow pass a mere fence
 had been smashed by a bunch of winding notch through the ridge the little range horses the previous season and
 the valley floor bore a heavy growth of grasses growth lay scattered in all directions it was which would be
 difficult to handle if the a mat that no plough could force its way fire came upon us the only
 break was a through clearly the simplest thing to do small narrow foot trail twelve inches wide was to burn
 this obstruction away very possibly an old buffalo trail as i set out my mother begged to accompany me it
 was a hot still morning when i applied and i agreed more to keep her from worrythe match at that
 time i was simply un ing than from any real expectation that she aware that a fire creates its own
 wind could do very much of a positive character even sonic magistrates knew no better actually however her assistance proved
 since such a plea was often received as a invaluable mere lie on this occasion it seemed in one minute
 as though one could cover the fire my plan was to use the narrow path as with his hand and
 in the next a ten acre a firebreak and to backfire southwards in field wouldn t have contained it in
 almost the direction of the smoke the little path no time the fire was romping up the valley itself was
 so overgrown with trampled like an express train i don t think i ever grasses however that it had to
 be raked heard where it burned itself out or was clear befcre i dared to light a match my stopped
 mother went before me with the garden rake and pulled the grasses over on to the the next day sunday

 of fire that could possibly open side but there was nothing to protect jump my trail once the main blaze
 was on us from the forest direction we had not its way to meet the destroyer to the south yet
 been on the place six months and the since there was no water obtainable until willow scrub was tall and
 thick enough that we got a mile or more through the pass i it had to be cleared before a
 firebreak could carried a pail with me to re dampen our be ploughed around the house and it was wet

 the role of coal mining as it has influenced and in turn been influenced by the growth of lie city
 on the one hand the growth of the city provided an expanding market for the coal mines until coal was
 supplemented as a source of domestic heating by natural gas and oil in the late 1940 s on the other
 hand the physical expansion of the city and of the coal mines eventually conflicted with serious effects for both types

 the gramaphone or perhaps in alberta some years previously he had 20 one large farm at wetaskiwin and another bit
 too much near red deer the latter was a well run stock farm for pure bred horses and cattle it
 was while he was with root that pearkes first brushed against canadian poli pearkes admired his large imported perch tics
 root was a conservative and in the eron horses and his valuable shorthorn cattle were shown at most local agricultural
 1908 federal election he ran as a candidate fairs buyers cam ne from all parts of the in the local
 riding pearkes was interested province to bid 125 to 150 for them the and enthusiastic on numerous occasions offer of
 a job on root s farm had much to when the election campaign was underway commend it not only were
 the wages good he drove root to nearby towns and villages but the opportunity to work on a well run
 listening to the give and take of the political farm with first class stock meant getting meetings root lost the
 election but prebetter experience mr eversole the farm sumably he made one convert who many manager ran root s red
 deer farm with years later would be on the platform himthe help of his brother and one other farm self
 with greater success hand they were a most congenial group shortly after his defeat in the election and as pearkes
 would still be no more than mr root decided to go into semi retirement a few miles from his brother
 ted and his on his farm at wetaskiwin and as a result friends the pages he accepted the offer reduced
 his activities on his red deer farm life on the root farm was close to what it was at this
 time that his farm manager pearkes had imagined he might be doing mr eversole moved to the berkhamsted when he
 came to canada he was working farm to manage it bringing pearkes with entirely with animals and few things pleased
 him pearkes however had been thinking him more moreover these were well kept of striking out on his own to
 take up a sleek beasts unlike those he had been work homestead he had saved as much of his ing
 with work animals were kept in fenced wages as he could to pay for the small down pastures and well
 tended barns one of the payment necessary to obtain a 160 acre jobs pearkes enjoyed was displaying them homestead there
 were hundreds of thoueither at the fairs or to purchasers who sands of acres of crown land which awaited visited
 the farm the plough and it was felt quite rightly that the more people who could be attracted feeding watering
 and caring for the ani to the vest the greater would be the natmals kept pearkes and the others busy
 in ional prosperity in addition to the small winter hay had to be hauled from n root s down payment
 and as a curb to speculaother farm n west of red deer which meant tion the candidate had to cultivate
 thirty driving through the town and some five acres of land in three years time and live miles beyond it
 pearkes usually went with on the homestead for not less than six eversole brother each driving a team one months
 of the year when these basic conwith percheron stallions and the other with ditions had been met the 160 acre
 farm the mares returning through the town the was considered to be proved up and besleighs loaded with hay the
 huge animals came the property of the homesteader demonstrated their strength with the ease they pulled their load not infrequently
 while at the school farm pearkes repeople in the town would stop to watch the ceived a letter from an
 english family hometwo teams go by and pearkes would be as steading in the dovercourt area near rocky proud of
 the horses as if he owned them mountain house the baileys had four sons himself the journey for hay was
 made al who had gone to berkhamsted and aware most every day during the winter no matter of george s
 ambition mr bailey had writwhat the weather sometimes the trail would ten about some available land near their be so
 rough that one of the heavily loaded own farm close to the clearwater river sleighs would tip over which meant
 extra pearkes decided to visit the family and cxwork for both men re loading hay in mid amine the area
 himself he knew from winter helped to build up muscle and work talking with others that there was homeup an
 appetite having to handle a ton of stead land in the area both to the west and it three times
 in one trip however was a east each with its own attractions and ha 21 this farm near red deer
 is typical of the ones visited by george pearkes while attending berkhamsted farm this view was taken in 1906 bilities
 to the east was the open flat occasional farm house or tiny hamlet in an prairie country which lacked wood
 for area only then being opened up at the same building a house barn fences and so forth time it
 was indicative of the extent to which but which was easier to cultivate to the george had become accustomed to
 life on west one was in the rolling foothill country the farming frontier of alberta as well as where trees
 were more plentiful but with his youthful self confidence which was to be less cleared ground the decision he was
 a great asset in the years to follow to make was based on other factors as well after a day
 s rest at the baileys he was certainly a limited amount of capital could in the saddle again looking over
 prospective not be ignored homestead sites in the area he decided on a quarter section a few miles from dover
 in straight line distances it was about court on the west side of the clearwater fifty miles from red deer
 to rocky moun in fact the river bordered the site there tam house but in 1909 there was no road
 was a good spring on the section and the or railroad to get there pearkes would river could provide water
 for the animals have to ride so early one morning mount as well as be a source of fish there
 was ed on a big bronco he set out on the long not much open land except around the est
 ride he was ever to make in his life sloughs but the poplar and willow scrub from the school farm
 he crossed the red was comparatively light and trees to con deer river struck to markerville and i net struct
 a log house were available the seethe innisfail trail this ran west to raven tion seemed attractive so george set
 out at that time no more than combined post again for red deer once more making the office store and
 road house run by a mr trip in one day in due course he registered berry from raven the trail
 went north his claim at the land office paid his ten through stauffer and passed close to the dollar fee
 and undertook the conditions of baileys about ten miles south of rocky homesteading mountain house by the time pearkes arrived
 at the end of the day he had ridden in the next few weeks pearkes was busy seventy miles a
 remarkable feat for both preparing for his new venture using his man and horse it was a lonely ride with
 savings he bought a team of horses a cow the wilderness broken now and then by an two pigs a
 few chickens a tent stove pro 22 visions some tools and various other items to carry all the stock through
 so quite necessary to start the animals probably early in the game i had to get rid of the two
 pigs they had grown to would not have been allowed to set a hoof marketable size and i was able
 to sell on the root farm but with only a few hund them red dollars to spend one could not
 expect then with winter coming alongi had percheron horses or pure bred cows with to have some sort of shack
 to live in it was made from a few logs very small his supplies in the wagon the hens clucking
 ones because i hadn t the time to go in their coop and the cow trailing along be and get
 good logs they were chinked hind pearkes once more set out along the with moss which stopped the wind innisfail
 trail only this time the journey coming through took three or four days when he arrived this rough cabin was
 devoid of comforts he set up a tent on the rise close to the barrels or boxes were used as
 chairs and a river and with the optimism of youth be table constructed with a few boards was gan his
 career as a homesteader some of abouf the only other piece of furniture his first problems he described later as
 fol there was no bed and indeed no wooden lows floor so that for many months including the first thing
 that one had to do the first winter george slept on a bundle well the horses were there the cow
 of fir branches wrapped in the few blankets was therebut there was nothing to he possessed with his coat on
 top of them n keep them in they could wander a small tin stove kept him warm n as long
 through the bush anywhere eventually i got a couple more cows i think as it was fed with the logs
 he cut from his the most i had was four and homestead but usually after midnight when the trouble was
 that they did wander the trees were cracking with the frost outthrough the bush and while you could side and
 the embers were turning grey in hobble the horses you couldn t very well hobble a cow you put a
 bell on it the stove the water inside the shack would but i know each morning i wasted many begin
 to freeze which meant cracking the hours walking through the bush trying layer of ice in the bucket before he
 could to find the blessed cows until i got a little bit of fencing done the fencing wash up in
 the morning meant cutting tamarak posts hauling the first summer and winter were rough them to where you wanted to
 build he was no cook and eating porridge and your fence and then either putting barbed wire around them or
 cutting bannock made him relish all the more the poplar poles and nailing them onto the occasional invitations to dinner
 he received posts from the baileys once he attempted to the land had to be cleared of brush make bread
 the baking of bread he said and had to be cut out with an axe then later you had to
 get the stumps out and then you had to plow it welli got very was a new experience and i
 didn t very little plowing done that first year feel that i could spend the whole day if any there
 was no revenue and the kneading the dough and watching it cash that i had was quickly used up rise
 so having well breaded the dough i was very poor in those days i had and it being a very
 hot day i put it on nothing i had to cook my own meals the roof of my shack to
 rise the sun they consisted mostly of porridge and was hot and i went away and continued rice the nearest
 store was at stauf cutting brush the bread rose at first fer some twelve miles away i had but then
 a thunderstorm came up betaken what i thought would be enough fore i could get back to the pan of
 to carry me for several months so one dough naturally it fell flat lived on a little bit of bacon
 porridge food was never wasted no matter how and occasionally for a treatput some it was cooked the two pigs
 which used raisins into the rice and bannock i had thought that it would be pos to follow pearkes about
 like cats ate any sible to cut hay around the edges of the scraps from his table and when he
 was sloughs as many farmers did it was working they would be on the lookout for poor hay but it
 kept the horses alive any edible roots the first summer was very wet and you couldn t get near any
 slough to cut hay i did get just a very little of the upland ‘ personal interview with maj general
 pearkes hay which was in places where i had 21 july 1969 p 7 tried to clear off a little

 log two siorey house the constant hard and exhausting work in george had to seek work wherever he of clearing
 land coupled with the loneliness could find it to provide food for himself and of the homestead was relieved somewhat
 in his animals later when ted joined him n the following year when his brother ted they reached an agreenuent
 whereby george left the school farni to take up a home older and stronger would go out to work stead
 adjoining george s rough as it was while ted tended the stock ted had george s cabin represented a home
 tech brought only a riding horse with him wherehad none so it was decided to build a lar ger as
 george had a team which could be used log cabin on ted s section where both could for freighting when
 the prospects offered share domestic duties the two working to the practice of working on the homegather constructed a much
 better house with stead part of the year and working at whatlarger logs they built a cabin which h id
 ever job one could get elsewhere was comtwo rooms on the main floor while above mon if there was a

 might ed as sleeping quarters the sloping roof work constantly earning money while anheld sods rather than shingles and it

 improve the homestead initibasic as ever but at least george no longer ally when he was alone george could pick
 slept with only a few fir boughs separating up a few days work locally during the him from the bare
 ground first winter he recalled the greatest single problem faced by for a few days i remember digging george and
 his brother was the lack of any coal at rocky mountain house out of income neither had given any indication
 the bank of the river there were some negroes who were sort of contractors to their parents of the conditions
 under to get it and i worked for them they which they were living nor of their financial were quite
 decent and paid me a proper stringency by this time their parents had wage not the same as one man
 that separated and neither son had any desire i did quite a bit of hauling for when they were building
 the railway to norto add to their mother s problems by asking degg times were really tough there for financial
 help with no money coming was no revenue coming in except from 24 the sale of butter and a few
 eggs both women were happy at the family revery few eggs because we ate most of them the butter was
 made with a union but the glow of expectation must churn and it wasn t good butter at have dimmed

 that sort of thing from staufferi former abode one can only imagine what used to take the team and go
 into innis mrs pearkes thought rather than be fail and bring back a load of goods for shown into her
 bedroom the best the boys the store there was nothing at stauffer except just a store run by a swiss

 to good part of the day rather than for ami hour harvest a sufficient surplus which would see the local
 school was more than a centre them over to the spring as a result he still of learning for here
 too would be planned had to go out for long periods of work to the picnics and box socials at
 the dances provide basic necessities during the second held in the autumn and winter there was a winter he was
 able to do more freighting certain amount of drinking behind the barn and as usual he also worked at any
 job and somnetimes a fist fight for good measure available there was little money in freight it was not unusual
 to travel fifteen miles ing however as he said later by horse and buggy to go to a dance which
 they paid only a low amount for the was attended by young and old with familgoods hauled by the pound
 and that al ies bringing a hanuper for supper the niusic ways went to pay the bills which were would

 when i d the musicians may have lacked in skill they gone to innisfail and just slept by the made

 to go to a roadhouse ment as well there were times when i walked in to innisfail because i was
 going out look the pearkes used to visit the baileys ofing for a job and wasn t going to take
 the horses i went and worked with a ten and they frequently had sing songs in threshing gang and made
 money at that their large house on sunday evenings when i remember walking through mar neighbors would gather there george
 liked ketville it was dark at night and i saw music but had no ear for it he could not
 a light and went to a farmshouse there was an icelandic family there and never sing a solo as others
 could when asked yet have people been kinder than those everyone was supposed to contribute to the people were to

 spend pily almost thinking i was going hunt on social affairs was limited for the most ing part george and
 his brother could only en although work on the homestead was al joy sports sumch as riding or hunting while
 most unremitting occasionally there were mrs pearkes restricted herself to local visits times when one could take a day off
 and and looking after her sons enjoy a soc ial visit with the neighbors the it was in the late

 being built for the and his admiration for these hardy nien hudson s bay brigade steadily increased with closer contact
 it was one of these shallow scows that for the most part it was a delightful way the survey crew
 was to journey some three to travel h ere and there one met with hundred miles down river to fort
 mc chunks of ice left over from the break up murray this craft could carry a surprising and not until
 the last third of the voyage load steered with a long oar by an experi roughly between grand rapids and
 fort 27 mcmurray were there any serious rapids pearkes later described his job with the most spectacular was grand rapids
 itself survey crew as follows where the water boiled and whirlpooled once we established camp we started until it was
 white an island split the cur on the survey work there were two rent and loaded scows shot the upper
 part instrument men running the lines givof the rapids to the head of the island ing the direction and the
 elevation so there the scows were unloaded and their as to run the survey the axeman had to go out
 in front first of all you had freight carried by a narrow guage hand a rodman who went out which
 frequentoperated tramway on wooden rails to the ly wasn t far because there was fairly lower part of the island
 the empty scows dense bush thereand he would get the were then hauled back up stream and shot line from
 the instrument man then the axeman would have to cut that line through the channel on the right of the
 is and then it was all measured by chain land as it neared the end of the island in addition
 to that a reconnaissance had the men on land threw a cask into the to be made on either side
 of the line water attached to it was a line which the to report the type of ground there was
 on either side and so this work went crew on the scow caught up from n the water on with
 establishing camps which we and pulled to reach a heavy rope knotted to would probably remain in for three or
 it once they had secured the rope the men four days then having cut the line a certain distancethe camp
 would be on the island pulled the scow into land re moved to another suitable place so we loaded their
 equipment and prepared to could work another section from there continue their journey another portage had i thoroughly enjoyed it
 it wasn t too hard work i was young and strong to be made at the big cascade on another

 was decided to work as far into animals to see lynx bear moose in fact the winter period as possible

 1 was between three and four years of age and was tossed up behind my father on his horse as
 he rode to a cree imudian encampment on a level bench at the end of pine lake i remember the
 ride very clearly just how many tepees there were 1 do not know but it seeiu ms to nue there
 were a good number they were canvas covered instead of buffalo hides for this would be seventeen years after the
 buffalo had bee ruthlessly and wantonly slaughtered for their hides and tongues my next encounter must have been the for
 many years a small tribe of nonfollowing winter i was with 1 ny father who treaty indians camped by the
 lake for a was driving on the lake in his little home month or more in winter trapping and huntmade
 jumper when we came to a large ing night after night we d hear the beatiiug party of indians fishing
 through the ice my of the tom toms they lived in the white father stopped to pass the time of
 day with nuan s walled tent and sonic had tin stoves an older man and he very kindly gave me
 with the stove pipe going out through the a big jackfish my father told me to say end thank you
 to him but i was stricken with shyness and i can remember the old one day in spring when i
