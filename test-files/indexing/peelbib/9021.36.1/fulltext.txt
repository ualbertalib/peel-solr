 by james dempsey at the outbreak of world war one in 1914 in the 19 th centuly the indians of
 the canadian people were surprised to learn that many canadian prairies pursued a lifestyle based upon buffalo plains indians wanted
 to enlist it was thought that hunting and war as they followed an annual life indians who had suffered poverty
 and privation cycle which emphasized food gathering based on at the hands of the government and white society buffalo hunting
 they travelled in large gtuups and in general would have no reason to fight in a relied upon the use
 of the horse and a quasi foreign war what they did not realize was the military organization for offensive and
 defensive fact that a number of plains indians had retained purposes though differing in certain details the a warrior ethic
 in spite of government efforts over blackfoot blood peigan sarcee plains cree nearly half a century to suppress it to
 young men the achievement of military distinction remained james dempsey is a teacher at saskatchewan indian an idea l though

 to dreams and visions as sources of following the acquisition of the horse by the supernatural powers an intense vision

 to transport guardian which would protect him for the rest of their baggage and this demand led to a new

 hostile camp with the intention of killing dull and oppressive reserve life it also became as many of the enemy
 as possible the slain when plains indians could no longer go to war religion and ritualism played an increasingly important
 role in their lives the brave dogs society one of the nomadic warrior societies of the blackfoot is seen here
 performing its ceremonies at the 1913 sun dance it was the prairie indian who exulted in dangers he was a
 free and driving man continually in contact with danger on the open prairie there 7 was never safety from the
 attack of any enemy who might be concealed in ambush anywhere this tended to make the plains cree contemp ‘
 ‘ tuous of danger for it was everywhere around him possession of the horse had made it possible to live
 on the prairie it was the horse that 4 ‘ helped develop the reckless and often wild character of the
 prairie indian i ‘ a men were very conscious of the division of l labour between them and their wives
 even though he male s traditional position had declined since hunting had been replaced by rations and warfare had been
 abolished to avoid the indignity of doing a woman s chor e he wife could always ‘ be sent to
 collect the weekly rations so that the warrior husband would have no need to grovel before the indian agents this
 dependency on he government for food combined with the res trictive lifestyle of the reserve r esulted in an outwardly
 lethargic and helpless attitude arising in many males which was interpreted as simply l being lazy by outsiders such as
 the agents traditionally responsible for hunting and pro ‘ tecting the camp the warrior s consider ed the activities of
 the females beneath them and an insult to their dignity toiling in the ground which when children entered school they

 was already the influences of the parents and grandparents well indoctrinated into the philosophy of war and wer e noted
 by some agents indicating hat the the idea ls of bravery native culture still survived among the younger generation two
 typical comments are as follows in the early twentieth century a system of church run residential and industrial schools had
 been in existence in western canada for over twenty years their aim was to break the culture to transform native
 youths into god fearing christians who possessed british values part of this policy used a historically tested but not always
 successful technique in which the indian children were separated from their parents and home environment so that they could be
 effectively iso lated and ‘‘ civilized 29 the parents were thought to be inflexible in retaining the values of their
 ancestors and therefore were not subjects for conver sion and at the same time were a negative influence on their
 children ‘ 1 it the government concluded that the individualis tic personality of the plains indians with their ‘ seeming
 lack of responsiblity needed to be i extinguished this was especially true of the ‘ warrior ethic of the males
 which had been the centre of their life influencing theirgoals expectations and values yet this war ethic survived in an
 underground form and continued to influence the lives of the younger generation even after attending school the attributes of a
 warrior ethic also hel ped some students to combat the influence of the residential schools and to pass on i
 i the heroic tales when out of earshot of their supervisors even when strange events occurred at school students might
 interpret them according to their native traditions for example when a violent thunderstorm broke over the residential school at lebret
 sask in 1897 students believed young men took e ery ad antage to participate in native that something supernatural was
 happening as festivities angry chief a cree from hobbema is seen one of the cr ee students r ecalled about
 1912 in costume ready for a dance it is found that the graduates who return to pagan and british educated
 native children who would homes sometimes return to the ways of their embody the ideals values and morals of the
 fat hers when educated they are bright peop le but are dominant culture inclined to adopt the easy habits of
 the indian while on the surface it appeared that the conand it is difficult to keep them steadily certed efforts
 of the schools and government offioccupied 33 cials had extinguished the warrior ethic in reality although fifty years had passed

 through such pursuits as there was a strong surviving element who con parades games mock baffles counting coups tinued to
 maintain the values of a century before and in the rituals of warrior societies as an they had in the
 agents eyes become a negative anthr opologist commented about that period element which the government believed hindered they bought medicine
 bundles they joined the people s progress towards civilization in societies they honour ed their sons and daughters saskatchewan he
 agents comments attest to this with lavish payments in both horses and goods belief that the elders encouraged the younger
 for ceremonial privileges ‘ in short he indians generation to lead a free and easy life preserved much of the
 old outlook in spite of owing to tribal customs the progress in this government efforts to suppress them agency is
 slow 35 amongi the old people one of the acceptable ways of recapturing some progressive ideas are not much accepted
 and old of the warrior personality was through military pagan ways are followed 36 there are too many of the
 older and what one might call the stag cadet training this was carried out on a few of nationist element
 in this band for them to make the indian reserves particularly in alberta and rapid progress manitoba on the blood
 reserve for example even with the government s policy of regula some thirty boys were in a company at st
 paul s tion and segregation the values of the warrior anglican school for some it became a first step et
 hic continued to be expounded well into the late into the military to gain traditional war honours 19 th and
 early 20 th centuries in february of 1887 at the same time he indians viewed the the young men on
 the blood reserve were waiting queen and royal family as completely separ ate for the snow to melt so they
 could raid the gros entities from the canadian government in 1907 ventres in montana 38 a year later in october
 for example the bloods appealed directly to the of 1888 a peace treaty between the gros ventres king for an
 investigation of their land problems and the bloods was being placed in jeopardy by when no results were forthcoming head
 chief the young men from both sides stealing hor ses crop eared wolf commented we were told that in 1889

 canadian indians enlisted for active service trolled the lives of western canadian indians for with the canadian expeditionary force even
 almost two generations and had implemented a hough they were exempt from military service paternalistic policy of assimilation in the

 for here are no waters to dash no forests to roar no surfaces to r esound while the short grasses
 give forth no perceptible rustle and there is something awful in the titanic rush of contending natural for ces which
 you can feel but cannot see or hear the wind may sweep away your breath on a current of sixty
 miles an hour and he clouds may rush through the sky as in a tornado but no sounds confound the
 ear a winter blizzard which carries on its frigid breath destruction to life which blinds the eyes and which drives
 the particles of ice and snow with cutting force against the frozen cheek and through all but the heaviest fur
 clothing is compar atively inaudible and the traveler appears to himself to struggle vainly with an implacable ghostly for ce
 which fills the whole creation when a lso nature is undisturbed in tranquil summer mood and the sky is blue
 and flecked with fleecy clouds floating far aloft a ll sound seems to have died out of the world and
 a mantle of silence enfolds everything partaking of the predominant natural sentiment man becomes silent also he ceases to talk
 to his mate and becomes moody and taciturn the merry song of the voyager re echoing between wooded shor es
 the shout he joke of the cheerful traveler here are stilled stifled you might a lmost say by the immeasurable
 muffle of silence here are no woods to give back the answering shout and the crack of the rifle is
 insignificant the cry of the passing wildfowl in the darkness as you lie awake in your tent at midnight comes
 to you with a weird faint far away sound as if heard in a dream and even the r ar
 e thunder br eaks impotently on the continent of silence if a comrade is lost and you wish to make
 some sign to direct him to the camp no noise which you can make with voice or firearms will be
 of any avail for such noises will penetrate only a few rods at farthest by day the only resource is
 a flag on some elevation or a smoke of burning grass by night rockets must be sent up as at
 sea or if these have not been provided firebrands from the camp fire may be thrown up with some hope
 of success no one can know until he has experienced it the longing which takes possession of one who has
 been for weeks practically separated from speaking men once more to hear the sounds of common life the roar of
 the city streets the sound of bells and even the crowing of the cock in the early dawn the northwest

 the heaters in the guest tents while wood and kindling lighting all fires fetching they were supposedly still asleep i
 remember a water washing dishes peeling vegetables bury tall chap s bare feet protruding in the cold air from ing
 noncombustible garbage and keeping the the end of his bed i resisted the temptation to tickpremises tidy i slept in
 my own tent and ate at le them the evenings were cool and nights cold the cook tent i had
 no direct contact with the often with frost the elevation was over 5 000 guests one morning while filling the
 boss s wood feet often before bedtime the guides lit a fire in box i clumsily upset a tray of
 cooked bacon set the tepee to entertain the guests with songs and on a large water boiler to keep warm
 while the yarns i don t remember being invited to these eggs were frying the air was blue with sparks
 when i finally retired to my lonely tent i had no from miss pirie s hotline to the almighty but

 near the foot of the falls he ta feed ya was friendly and no doubt was attr acted by miss

 timetable there was lots of fresh air and one evening when i was washing the supper he environment was beautiful
 in afternoons after dishes down behind the cook tent miss pirie he lunch guests had gone and before the over
 brought me a lady s riding boots which had got night people arrived for supper we had our inter muddy

 i had no kit she kidded me dry tree for the woodpile to haul the logs there along and found
 me some rags and grease i was was an old saddle horse which i looked after and really fond of
 the old girl so did the best i could exercised on nearby trails often i cut wood in and the
 boots were duly returned to the owner the cool of evening occasionally guests strolled but not by me after breakfast

 to right back mr rice kinaird unknown and the author front bert drake his brother and three unknown at the
 dishwashing station as usual when the lady 1921 a summer job was again on my calendar in her nice clean
 boots came down probably so i wrote to lyal currie brewsters manager at directed by miss pine she thanked me
 and field reminding him of my summer there in 1919 offered a 2 00 tip this i politely declined said
 and telling of my enhanced experience with horses i was paid for my work and that my family never on
 the ranch he replied to report to him at field had to take tips for a living she was offended
 after mid june and marched off in a bit of a huff just as her on arrival at field i
 was given a spot in party which included a son nearly my age were brewsters bunkhouse and ate with others
 of their ready to mount and leave she came again said staff currie was a scot like so many of
 brewsters she appreciated my attitude and repeated her people he with his crippled wife a son and thanks i was
 certainly getting some lessons in the daughter in their early teens had heir own rudiments of human nature quarters in
 brewsters depot they were very good in early september when the camp was shut to me it was rumored that
 currie had a taste for ting down my baggage was conveyed to field the product of his native land and
 that brewsters by road and i was told to deliver the saddle horse had tried to discipline him for this
 their wealthy to bmwsters stables there instead of going dl t customers from various world capitals protested i was allowed
 a couple of days to see the local that if curie was not at field to welcome them sights by
 trail first day i went up to the head of and handle their business they would not stop yoho valley
 jock tocher may have accompanied there so he was r einstated perhaps with a me or at least told me
 what to see and how to find warning my way the second day i went up over yoho my jobs
 included cleaning the stable for about pass and down to emerald lake and thence by twenty horses first thing before
 breakfast stanroad to field the high trails afforded some grand dards were high during the day looking down views of
 the surroundings i duly delivered the the long row of equine posteriors if i saw a tail horse to mr
 currie at field and thanked him for go up i would rush with a scoop shovel to catch his kindness
 i picked up my baggage and hopped the droppings in mid air the horses also had to the eastbound train
 through scenery now more be fed water ed harnessed or saddled curried and familiar and got to calgary in time
 to enroll in bedded down with clean straw at night i knew grade xi at crescent heights high school all
 about this from previous jobs and have always liked horses another job was driving the wagon i had now seen
 a bit of what lay just beyond for customers baggage to and from the station those rugged mountains visible on
 the western just across the bridge they walked over and skyline from calgary but i did not know then occasionally
 one would ride with me to chat one that the summer after next 1921 fate would give nice kid on
 unloading his family s stuff at me one more wonderful summer based at field brewsters gave me an american silver
 dollar tip b c i was preoccupied but thanked him and put it in my adventur e just over the
 gr eat divide at my pocket where it nearly burned a hole field in 1919 was followed by a trip
 right through crossing the bridge for another load i threw it to the pacific coast late in 1920 after grade
 xi in the river again the price of family pride exams at calgary in june that year i got a
 ranch one special job was to take a string of three job near empress alberta i was too far east
 to or four saddle horses down to golden to be shod see the rockies but it augmented my experience there
 was a tote road of sorts and i made the trip with horses late in october after the harvest of
 about thirty five miles in one day it would have i rejoined my parents who meantime had moved been too
 slow and dangerous to go on the cpr to east bumaby near new westminster b c the track especia lly
 in the confines of kicking horse trip by cpr was spiced with nostalgia of my sum canyon mr hughes the
 blacksmith at golden mer at field in 1919 but the rest of the trip was a friendly old character arranged
 a bunk and food through new country including golden and for me he also provided entertainment all day revelstoke in
 pro dawn twilight the arid working on the horses the second evening he sagebrush hills near kamloops mystified me gave
 me my first ever drink of whiskey and was speeding downgrade in the fraser canyon around amused at my choking
 and sneezing i think it was those scaiy rock and river curves was thrilling on the third day that i
 got my horses back to field during the 1920 21 winter i attended the in good shape without incident university
 of british columbia in vancouver for about mid july there was a temporary rush at first year pre engineering arts
 early in june glacier house west on the cpr mainline between spelling its pretty name the selkirk mountains around glacier
 are different geologically from the rocky mountain sedimentaries at field this shows up in the scenery i had one or
 two trips by saddle horse as guide s helper along the old abandoned railway grade up into rogers pass this
 was also good preparation for dr parks geology lectures later after about ten days at glacier house i was recalled
 to field these trips by train familiarized me with the lovely scenery en route i had not been long back
 at field when they sent me up to wapta lake hector station where the cpr was building a bungalow camp
 this was the base for day trips by saddle horse to lake o hara and other places i am quite
 sure that i found colonel moore in chaige for brewsters hero too my job was wrangler for ray legace one
 of brewsters prestigious guides we got along well and later he tried to persuade me to join him in a
 guiding venture at glacier national park in montana after two or three trips to lake o hara with ray i
 was allowed to take small parties there alone perhaps because the scenery was so distr acting i remember one or
 two minor ball ups which luckily were inconsequential one lady was unseated when her horse balked suddenly crossing cataract brook
 she was unhurt but i offered her my horse she declined and sternly remounted her own saying in broad oxford
 accents i will mawster him between these trips i kept busy at wapta helping to build corrals and cutting firewood
 the highlight at wapta was when ray and i were assigned to take j murray gibbon chief publicity agent for
 the cpr from montreal and his party with all its paraphernalia for an overnight trip to lake o hara included
 were his son about my age seventeen a cine photographer and a landscape artist plus a shocking array of cameras
 easels tripods palettes personal kits bedding food and camp gear this called for six good saddle horses and as many
 or more pack animals we got a reasonable start from wapta after not too much confusion and arrived at lake
 o hara about eight miles in time for a late lunch near the lake was a fine little meadow with
 good horse feed and a small log cabin with built in bunks a table stove and benches i remember the
 window was barred with strong iron it was pr obably a refuge cabin built by the cpr the bungalow camp
 here was built a year or two later very likely on mr gibbon s recommendation miss pine the camp cook
 at takakkaw falls in 1919 had a warm heart but could be cranky and short tempered golden and revelstoke where
 brewsters also had the concession for transport i was sent there by train and again was put on the baggage
 wagon between the station and the hotel less than a mile origina lly the station and the hotel were together
 but when the connaught tunnel was opened in 1916 the station was moved to the tunnel s western portal my
 boss there was colonel phil moore a partner and a brother in law of the br ewster s one horse
 on the baggage wagon was a bit loco the noise of the tr ains at the station scar ed him
 so he had to be watched backing the wagon into the platform for loading was tricky even with a quiet
 team at the hotel ther e was a steep sharp curve fr om the r oad on the old grade
 down to the hotel s unloading area once negotiating it with a full load my skittish horse swung around too
 sharply and upset the whole load luckily col moore was there to straighten things out and was obviously relieved when
 i crawled out from under the pile unhurt after the mess was tidied up i found several american silver dollars
 on the ground they had leaked out fr om one of the bags i turned them over to the colonel
 cleaning the small stable was also on my menu i often did this in the evening and dumped the manure
 into the lllecillewaet river from a bridge nearby so much for pollution in those days one evening a tourist strolled
 by and asked me the name of the river i didn t know and even now have trouble we unpacked
 installed our guests in the cabin a cloud of smoke leaving the animal s back and staked out the horses
 supper was delayed to bare as raw beefsteak the poor little fellow was exploit remaining daylight for movies by the
 quickly made insensible forever by this time camera man this included a few fake stunts with all were very wide
 awake and hungry for breakthe horses in the meadow one set was for me fast so began another long day
 to saunter down to the edge of the lake and gaze while ray prepared the meal i rounded up the
 intently at beautiful mount lefroy rising steeply horses grass and bushes being drenched in heavy behind after quenching my spiritual
 thirst i was dew they weren t very thirsty when i led them to stoop and gracefully dip a drink
 from the lake to the lake for water after breakfast there were in the brim of my hat smack my
 lips and resume more movies and the artist got busy with his my ecstatic gaze at lefroy this was my
 first and brush finally after lunch packing and tidying up last ever role as movie actor we headed back down
 the trail to arrive at wapta it was after dark when ray and i got the party before supper fed
 and bedded down in the cabin and the horses my summer was now more than half gone stabilized in the
 meadow we were more than early august a rumor was that bill brewster a ready to roll into our blankets
 on the ground under hardheaded business man had recently returned a tarp and soon fell into the arms of morpheus
 from glacier national park in montana to get the lulled by the comforting resonance of the horse company s operations
 at banff out of the red bell nearby just before daylight we were roused he came up to wapta when
 i was working around by a rumpus in the cabin with shouts mr the corrals and quizzed me about my
 job with guide mr guide ray grunted an oath and just a hint of hostility it is alleged that some
 of said come on kid ther e may be a bear in br ewster s top officials and guides did
 not approve there we pulled on pants and boots and rushed of university boys on summer jobs they scornover inside
 the cabin all were up with a por fully called us babes in the woods so on our cupine for
 company they must have left the door return to wapta with the gibbon party i was not ajar for ventilation
 the artist was down on hands surprised to find curie there from field to say and knees tr ying to
 shoo mr porky out the door that on bill brewster s order s i was laid off but with a
 lighted candle he got it too close and in anticipation good old curie had arranged a ignited the quills poof
 a burst of flame and job for me with the cpr maintenance crew at the author s father thornton andrews
 visited him at takakkaw camp in 1919 field and he said further that i could sleep in when a train
 pulled in i tried to locate my ice brewsters bunkhouse there cart near where the diner usually stopped then for
 some reason perhaps no train curie and with nice clean ice chunks in a bucket i climbed i walked the
 ties back to field that evening up on top of the car with a light ladder and arriving there about
 midnight it was natural in dumped them down a covered chute usually i such circumstances to exchange a few personal
 made several ascents and had to be quick about confidences he said his family owned dockside it one day when
 i was up top the train began warehouses on the clyde like others from good to pull out the ladder
 fell down and i wondered families in britain he loved the rustic life in the how i would survive going
 through the spiral tunwilds of our mountains his treatment of me was nels in that precarious position fortunately a always
 that of a kind gentleman trainman noticed my predicament and gave three back at field my first job with the
 cpr was long pulls on the signal cord for the train to stop one of the worst ever before or
 since fortunately all s well that ends well it lasted only a couple of days a carload of coal dunng
 this last phase of the summer on days briquettes had been shunted on a siding at coal off i did
 some hiking one trip was up to the old bins in the yard my task was to move the cargo
 monarch mine on mount stephen about thr ee out the door into a chute or wagon the scoop miles up
 from field along the cpr track it was shovel held more than i could lift for a full eight then
 inoperative near it there was a good view hour day the work began at the door with gravity down the
 kicking horse valley to the van home and fresh air to help soon the filthy stuff had to range in
 the distance be moved farther and farther from the ends of the i was paid off in early september and
 returned car where ventilation was minimal the weather to bumaby in time to enroll at the vancouver was hot and
 the mordant dust was vicious body normal school to qualify as a teacher after 1926 and clothes satur ated with
 sweat absorbed the it was my good fortune to make several through caustic dust in every pore even after a
 hot bath trips by cpr past field when i enrolled in foreshampoo and complete change of clothes my skin stry
 at the university of toronto was sor e and inflamed perhaps this job was to test me out or make
 me quit but i survived and was hen assigned to the gang servicing passenger trains during their half hour stop
 at the station my particular job was on the ice cart a fine oldtimer tom robinson far senior to me
 had the coal wagon ice was cleaner but was bad for his rheumatism and involved some acrobatics a mr laws
 collected the garbage he had a pig farm at the edge of town and no doubt salvaged he swill to
 sell back to the cpr recycled as pork we worked an eight hour day and six days a week my
 pay was about forty cents an hour i bought meals at the y coffee shop and thanks to cume had
 a fr ee bunk at brewster s between trains we hauled our carts down to the ice house and coal
 bins in the yard to refill we wer e told to stay out of sight down there for any spare
 time this provided a bit of sociability i think old robinson had a small room at the y and ate
 frugally at the coffee shop i still have two of his letters on ymca letterhead sheets the first dated december
 29 1921 reported his safe return to field after visiting my home in burnaby and ‘ indicated his interest in
 a small acreage chicken farm there for his retir ement the second dated february 18 1922 thanked me for some

 the first three parts of these recollections the author told of her arrival from scotland in 1905 and her first
 seven years at the cumbrae sheep ranch south of grassy lake ‘ each season after lambing time he sheep were
 put out to another pasture till it was time for p shearing that meant getting ready to start at daybreak
 at first we would follow in a wagon and later a democr at which i decided was a com a
 fort and then came the buggy and later the motor car i didn t see anything wrong in picking up
 ewes or lambs when they got tired and putting them in the wagon or democrat or even the buggy but
 i did resent hem riding first class in the car i soon got to know that the sheep had as
 much right to ride there as i had according to a sheep man view if a sheep or lamb was
 sick it was all right for my husband to get up in the nighttime and look after them but if
 the children cried hat was my job and he could turn over and go to sleep for a number of
 years after the country was homesteaded we had the local farmers come to do the shearing many of them had
 never sheared before and after supper each night they would go to their own homes so my job was to
 turn the grindstone while my husband sharpened their shears for the next day i would turn and turn until catherine
 neil my arms were so tired i could have cried but if i sa id one of the men might
 do it i got the answer them through the chute and into the dipper as that sheep shearing for a
 whole day was no boy s each lot was dipped one of the men would bend job and the men
 wer e tired so as mother s work over the vat and remove the grass or straw floating is never
 done and i turned and turned on the top one day my children came with me after shearing came dipping
 and while we and my second girl aged four went into he were putting in our time on the scrip
 land i had corral she watched the men clear the grass so to move every six months so by the
 first of july when they went to chase some more sheep into i was away fr om the r anch
 and had to go back the pens she bent down to clean out some of the there for the dipping
 as i had to cook for the men grass which had been left however the side of we had all
 the sheep in the large shed and from the dipper was slippery and she went in head first there they
 went to the dipping vat there were the sheep were making so much noise that no little pens where we
 put some sheep before putting one heard her cry but luckily a neighbour was recollection of a sheep herder s
 bride part four by catherine neil passing in his buggy and saw her fall in so he it all avay
 of course the salesman had cashed jumped the fence and pulled her out you can the cheque and left the
 district imagine how i felt when he earned her in to me it was really funny to go visiting and
 see these and said i found her in the dipper ma am family pictures in so many houses and to
 tell each my daughter was quite sick for some time as she other how we had been taken in those
 who had had swallowed some of the dip and for weeks held out long enough and got the pictures without
 we could not get the smell of the dip out of her paying for the frame had a laugh at
 us hair several months later another salesman came to our part of the prairie was infested with gophers our door
 while i was sitting outside he asked me and they did a lot of damage to crops every year to
 step inside as he had something to show me the farmers put poisoned grain in their holes early but i
 recognized the cases he was canying i told in the spring and this reduced their numbers at him i wasn
 t interested he was very persistant one time the municipality offered two cents for and said his pictures were beautiful
 hand tinted every gopher tail and later one cent and the photos i told him that this part of the
 country had school children got busy snaring them drowning been canvassed already and if he knew what was them out
 of their holes and even shooting them good for him he would make for town again he in order to
 get the tails a councillor in each dis was pretty mad as a neighbour had brought him trict paid the
 children and it was not unusual for to our place and had told him we would likely some of the
 big boys to bring a sack of tails on drive him back he got to burdett just after the one
 occasion a smaller boy came later crying that evening train had pulled out so had to spend the his tails
 had been stolen the kind councillor paid night in the hotel we found out later that the man him in
 full but when the boy tried the same trick who had driven him to our home was one of those
 at different places a ll the children were told that victimized by the first traveller henceforth they would only be
 paid for the number we had many salesmen come with their difof tails delivered ferent wares and it was really
 amazing the trade we had all kinds of travelling salesmen selling they did of course people did not often get
 to photo enlargements in our district they had no town so a man with a good sales talk did very
 cars so they had to travel by buggy or democrat well generally hired they would ask to see a family
 there were quite a number of bachelors and few photograph and when the old pictures were girls in the area
 so when new settlers came in brought out of course the usual sales talk was those who had daughters were
 very popular and used about each being such a wonderful photo their homes became the meeting place for many just
 the thing for an enlargement the cost was of these lonely men so sma ll the salesman said while the
 frame was when the schoolhouse was built there was just a gift many of us gave orders for the enlarge
 great speculation as to who would find favour with ments and about six months later we were pre the new
 teacher but she was an eastern canadian sented with the finished picture duly framed in and ver y aloof we
 had no way of judging her a gift frame which we were told was covered with age but she had
 beautiful red golden hair and we real gold the men who did the delivering were women envied her there was
 never a hair out not hose who took the order so when we protested of place a nd she always
 had lovely little curls she about the price of the frame we wer e told it was boarded with one
 of the farmer s who had an in our contract quite a number refused to pay upstairs room without a
 partition two of the and the salesman had to take their picture away farmer s children slept there and to
 give the but they always came back again quoting a lower teacher a little more privacy a couple of sheets
 price till at last they left with the price of the were put up as a curtain when the lamps
 were picture only lit teacher would put hers on the dressing table the pictures we received were in black and
 and one night the children saw her take off her white and coloured prints and we were told they beautiful
 wig and put it on a stand the secr et was were permanent one of the settlers got his wife
 s out picture enlarged and coloured and he took it out the next teacher was a young girl so charlie
 of the frame and washed it to test the paint next one of the bachelors got a horse and buggy
 and day he went to grassy lake and asked the banker started to court her he had opposition however to
 stop payment of the cheque when asked the for the telegraph operator at burdett thought she reason he said i
 vash my vive s face and i vash was nice too and whenever there was a dance in the neil
 family in 1916 included james and catherine back row with children left to right jean flora jennie and john and
 their pets the district the teacher was never at a loss for an i brought back both a new baby
 girl and a scottish escort girl to help me as there were now four children one day charlie had to
 go to town for repairs to look after i had my hands full which were at the depot and the
 operator asked work at a sheep ranch was never done as soon him if he would take a wire for
 the teacher when as lambing was over it was shearing then dip charlie got the telegr am he started right
 back ping by the time the place was cleared and the and acted as delivery boy when he handed it
 to sheep wer e away to summer pasture along came the teacher he asked if there was anything wrong haying
 and fodder harvest then the sheep came at home and she said no just a friend corn home for the
 winter and if it was a hard one it ing feeling that he was in her good graces for meant
 feeding all the time delivering the telegram he asked her if she would go to the dance with him that
 night she was very my experiment of bringing a girl out from scotland didn t work ver y well the
 bachelors came sony but could not go later the stor y was cir after her right away and by november
 we had her culated that charlie had actually delivered a message from the operator asking the teacher to wedding at
 the ranch with neighbour s from all over he district in attendance i waited till the next go to the
 dance we all had a good laugh and often after when charlie was driving into town spnng and then got
 a local girl but she could only wait for a couple of months before getting marsomeone was sure to call
 out going fur a wire for teacher ried i put an ad in an old country paper and it was
 always hard for me to get help for the managed to get another girl she arrived in july house at
 lambing time i was sometimes lucky again the bachelor s came and she was married to get a neighbour girl
 to help me for even a at burdett on new year s day that was the first month or six
 weeks till shearing was over when wedding at burdett i went home on my first visit to scotland in the
 acting on the belief that the old saying might fall of 1912 i made up my mind i would try
 and come true the third time be lucky i sent overbring back a mother s helper we left the ranch
 seas for number three she stayed with me for in october and by the end of december my hus eight
 months and then married a bachelor i gave band had decided to return to canada as some of up after
 that and just carried on myself with a his horses were sick i stayed on till spring when little extra
 help at lambing time before we got a minister at burdett the church were all away the folks had no
 way of getting and sunday school services were held every to the village for food or mail unless they walked
 sunday at the home of emmerson brown it so each saturday morning the woman going to do seemed to do
 us all some good just to get together her shopping called in at the different homes and road the bible
 and sing hymns no one preached picked up heir orders and delivered the goods on but we had discussions on
 the bible and as some her way home again were methodist some anglican and some pres the greatest drawback in
 this country at first byterian we had different views in the end we was the lack of schools many of
 the early setall thought the same that we needed a higher tlers childr en wer e of teen age before
 they got power to guide us and help us from day to day any schooling the first school was opened
 at after church we visited with different neigh grassy lake bours they were all friendly and if anyone was the
 first student minister came out from grassy sick kindly care and help were ever forthcoming lake in 1908 he was
 sent by the presbyterian people did not wait on an invitation to visit church he came to my home one
 day and when morning noon or night was a ll the same and i answered his knock he said my
 name is the welcome was always genuine if a neighbour mulligan i m irish i asked him to come in
 and was late getting home with a load of hay or coal he stayed with us for a few days
 it was lambing he was welcome to stay the night time so we had several men working for us after
 after the bmnsdale school was built he church supper they all cleaned up and came into the living was held
 ther e and visiting students would come r oom where we expected he would want to hold out from burdett
 to conduct the service no matter a service but instead he told us all about his colhow wet or cold
 the sunday people turned out lege days and the men one and all voted him many of them had three
 or five miles to travel a good sport next morning he held family worin a buggy or wagon but it
 did not matter as it ship after breakfast and i had to turn out all our was one s duty
 to go to church bibles it seemed as if we all received a blessing fr om that simple service and
 others we had his after several years we got a permanent minister other services that summer were held at the
 home who came to the schoolhouse every sunday he of william salvage at grassy lake so we could had been
 preaching in the east after coming out from england and his ideas of the west and its manage to get
 ther e only sometimes as that was a drive of ten miles people were not very high he had the
 idea that we had many types of sheep herders in the early our r eligious teaching had been sadly neglected
 days going to a ranch for a week or two was one so he started asking us questions as a
 teacher way of making money and getting well fed a would to school children man named joe came along about
 a month before many of these early settlers were from eastern lambing and although we r eally did not need
 him canada and were the sons and daughters of the at that time we asked if he would help to
 build first settlers there going to church was as much an addition to the sheep shed on the following part
 of their lives as their work so they resented sunday one of the storekeepers from grassy lake he attitude of
 the new minister and his method came out to visit us and solicit some of our trade of asking each
 member by name to answer ques i promised to patronize him and said if i could tions the climax came
 on sunday when the not get in to the store myself i would send a minister asked the meaning of
 repentance he got written order signed by one of us the following several answers such as being sorry for one
 s sin week we had quite a storm and joe asked if he endeavouring to live a better life asking
 god s could go to burdett for a few clothes as he had forgiveness and many other s but to
 a ll he said only those he was wearing no then he came to my husband and asked my husba
 nd offer ed to give him a horse to ride him he flashed back that s what you re hero
 but he said he preferred walking as he would keep to tell us and it s what we re paying
 you for warmer he did not go to burdett but to gr assy i was wishing i could hide but
 one of the women lake wher e he turned up at the store with a nice patted him on the
 back and said good for you order for number one and number two camp and jim that was the end
 of the questioning the order was signed in my name he ordered one winter after a very poor crop a
 ll the men groceries for number one camp and an outfit for in the district went to work on a
 new extension himself including gun boots and slicker underof the railway and the women were left to attend wear and
 socks and other things to be charged to to the home chores on the farms as the horses number two
 camp joe did not get back for several days so my was over and he got his money he beat
 it across brother in law went to grassy lake for the mail the line and some supplies and was told
 that our herder then there was the professor he went on a was in jail he had been having a
 glorious time spree every two or three months and after his and got so drunk that he was causing a
 disturbance money was all gone he would read bumps for the so he was put in jail on a drunk
 charge my customers at the grassy lake hotel brother in law went to see him and paid the fine he
 had been a headmaster in a school in scotof ten dollar s nd br ought him back he was very
 land and had his ba degree he was a well contrite and said he wasn t in he habit of
 drinking educated ma n well read on any subject you could so a very little upset him talk about if
 he borrowed any money during the when my husband opened the mail some time time he was drinking he would
 always pay it later he found a letter from the storekeeper at back a lthough he would have to work
 for it fir st grassy lake saying he had made up the order while he was working for us we
 had another but did not give the man the ten dollar s cash as scotsman with us too he had
 been in south it was not in the order joe had just been sent to africa for a number of
 year s and the professor round a little band of sheep up the coulee so we a lways wanted to
 read his bumps but mac waited till he returned to find out about the order refused one day mac was
 sent to the sheep camp he never did return but kept on going south with supplies and he took a
 bottle with him and my husband went to grassy lake next day and of course with drinking together hey became
 found out all about the order he had sent he was very friendly finally the professor worked on him told
 that joe had taken delivery of it in a buggy and took the chance to ready his bumps next day
 so we tr aced it and found the man to whom he when mac r eturned he kept saying that
 man sold the order for fifteen dollars he was mighty is the very devil he told us when he had
 been glad to return he goods and stand any loss to save in south africa he and another man had
 killed getting into trouble for being in possession of two men who had waylaid them and they took goods bought
 under false pretences the their horses and sold them he was sure not a soul storekeeper said he was a
 little suspicious when knew about it and yet the professor had told him the man asked for cash but as
 he had never seen when and where it happened my signature he could not check on it joe next time
 mac went to camp it had to be moved managed to get as far as foremost and got a job
 a mile nearer home as winter was coming mac at the mackenzie ranch but as soon as lambing hitched the
 hor ses onto the camp and moved it burdett seen here in 1910 was an important market town for the
 neil family as he was leaving the professor came up and the fuel problem was one great drawback for placed
 a saucer of water on the stove and told mac us as the coal mines were so far away but
 the he could not leave for home until the water was early settlers solved that when we cleaned out level
 thus showing that the camp was even they our sheep sheds and corrals in the spring some argued for a
 little time but when the professor of them would come and plough up the sheep levelled a gun at him
 mac moved the camp back manure which was tramped all winter and as hard and forward till the water was
 level when he got as rock this was loaded into wagons and hay home he told us he was leaving
 for scotland that racks taken home and then spread out to d ry night and no amount of coaxing would
 make him thoroughly it was then built into huts like the change his mind over and over he kept repeating
 eskimo igloos a little door was made at the front that man is the very devil and the fuel was
 taken from the inside leaving we had three neighbours who bore the names the outside till the last being built
 that way it of summers winter and spring some of them shed the rain this was about the only fuel
 used only stayed long enough to prove up on their land in summer it made a very hot fire which
 left a nd then sold out but winter or squire as we plenty of ash but it was easy to
 cool the house called him lived there till he died he was a groat after using it after seeing other
 people use it i man loved by all especially children but he was tried it too and the children got
 a great kick out his own worst enemy for he was too fond of the of taking their little wagon
 and filling it and then bottle making one of their pet lambs pull it home all he came to get
 some potatoes one day in spring i had to say was who is going to get me some and as
 we had them in the cellar i told him to sheep chips help himself he said the potatoes were sprouting
 sometimes we had trouble when one of the badly and offer ed to clean them and as i didn farmer
 s would plough up a lot and leave it to dry like the job and lambing was coming on i
 was along would come another farmer and load up glad of the help and forget to plough more before leaving
 soon when i called him for dinner he was a bit frisky they found out that it was more sporting
 for each and kept poking at the hired girl and whooping to dig his own than take his neighbour s
 a lot i did not think anything about it till late in saturday was children s day at the ranch
 during the afternoon when my husband returned i told lambing time and many a bum lamb found its him old
 squire was cleaning the potatoes so he way into the house to be fed for a couple of days went
 down the cellar and there found the old man so that some child would not be disappointed we fast asleep
 and a gallon jug of whiskey beside had children come for miles around and often him he evidently had a
 grand time when the men would go to the sheds in the early when he went to town and imbibed
 too freely morning some of these youngsters were already he was in the habit of letting his horses go as
 they there waiting it was really keen competition liked and they always took him home safely once we had a
 few who abused the privilege and when on the homeward journey they came to would pick up lambs while their
 mothers were where a new telephone pole had been placed in grazing and take them away many a night we
 the middle of the old road and ther e they stood hunted till dark for missing lambs for the mothers
 one on each side of the pole patiently waiting simply refused to stay on the bedground until they orders when
 squire awoke he found he had been had found their offspring it was really pitiful to there for hours see
 ewes running from lamb to lamb in search of when squire got tired of his own cooking he their lost
 ones sometimes we were successful in would come to our home and stay for a few days getting a ewe
 to take another lamb but it did not these were happy times for my children and we always work we
 would put paint or coal oil on a ll loved to have him come he would play cards the ewe
 s nose so she could not smell then left with the men each night and his hearty ha the new
 lamb and ewe in a pen for a day if a ha kept us all cheery lamb died we would
 skin it and put the skin like many of the original settler s homes had sod a jacket onto another
 lamb and leave it there for walls these were squares of sod cut from the a couple of days if
 the weather was not too hot prairie and piled one on top of the other with this method was more
 successful sometimes a a mud filling between to act as a cement some ewe would not take a different lamb
 and would of them were lime washed outside and looked all actually kill it by crushing it against the pen
 or right they were warm in winter and cool in the lying on it this seems scarcely creditable but i
 summer have seen it done many times ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ a ‘ ‘ 4 i ‘‘ r ‘ ‘
 i ‘ 1 the author s husband is seen here bringing in the lamb herd at the cumbrae ranch about
 1914 a herder has more to do than just following a boom to the stock man we had to lease
 extra land band of ewes and young lambs when herding where we could locate water and dig wells in one
 them if he sees a lamb that shows signs of getting place we got up against some cattle rancher who
 little milk he will watch for the mother to see had evidently been running his stock on that land what
 is wrong sometimes the herder will steal although it was supposed to be a sheep district a little milk from
 other sheep by holding the lamb we were quite unaware of the fact and dug a well and letting it
 suckle and if they have a mother and built troughs to water the sheep the water with little milk these
 little lambs soon learn to had to be hauled up by pails a few days later steal for themselves you
 can usually pick them two of the troughs were thrown down the well out by their dirty heads as they
 get behind the as there were no mischievous boys around we ewe when her lamb is suckling thought some rider
 had played a pr ank on the herder a week later we moved the herder s camp many of the
 homes in the early days had only wagon to a spnng in a draw between two hills one or two
 apartments and many amusing stories so he could get his water from there instead of went round of how visitors
 had to be acommo carr ying it from the well a few days later a neighdated one minister going his
 rounds came to the bour came to the ranch at midnight to tell us that house of a father and
 daughter the father asked the herder was poisoned a nd the sheep were dying the minister to put his horse
 in the barn and stop we lost no time in getting on the road to the camp for the night
 after the minister got inside the and when we got near the well we found sheep house he wondered where
 he would sleep when lying all over some dead and others sick and stagbedtime came the lather turned to the
 girl and genng about at the camp we found a very sick said mary put up the sheets and we
 11 go the herder we asked what happened and he said he bed mary strung sheets across one corner of
 the had hauled up some water for the sheep and as room where there was a bed and couch these
 he was hot he took a drink himself in a short sue fixed for her father and the minister and
 then time he saw some of the sheep stagger and fall putting another sheet across the opposite corner 1 down
 and then he too felt the effects of the s e spread out some bed clothes and retired her poison
 he crawled on his hands and knees to his sea no one felt as if they were suffering great privation
 camp and drank some mustard water when he felt a little better he went to the near est farm to
 after the country got pretty well settled our ask for help but was refused he staggered on grazing range was
 greatly restricted not only the to the next farm and there he found true canadians grazing but the water holes
 or sloughs these had who took him in and doctored him one of the been all over the countr y
 and had proved a great brothers kinniburg was their name r ode to purple springs and phoned to burdett to
 send us as lambing time came round each year we word luckily one of our neighbours was in town would
 herd the sheep and lambs to the new camp and got the message and br ought it to us we
 i cooked for the men so we moved part of the found poison had been put in the well but
 we house we had on the scrip land and it acted as were never able to bring the guilty party
 to justice a kitchen and bedroom we carried on this way although we had a fair idea of who he
 was for a number of years but moving every spring we moved the sheep after that to a pasture and
 cooking under difficulties got too much for nearer home and as the water situation became me so we drilled a
 well at home and that chor e more acute we leased land at agatha about ended thirty five miles north
 of bow island and on he other side of the river for a few years nothing seemed to disturb us
 we had to drive the sheep to the ferry and take people seemed to make the best of what they
 had them across in little bands we had quite a lake cr ops were sometimes good and sometimes bad on
 our new lease and we lambed over there at and then the shock came great britain was at war shearing
 time i cooked for the men in the camp with germany in 1914 and we were in it in a
 short wagon while they had their meals on a long table time we had a branch of the red cross
 organized outside after shearing we left the sheep with a and we held patriotic concerts dances and box herder and
 returned home for the haying we had socials to raise funds i even raised pet lambs and to attend camp
 ever y week to see the herder and these were raffled off at the dances people would take him supplies
 when winter came we put on drive for miles in a buggy democr at or wagon an extr a man
 to help the herder and while the to attend these affairs and no one spoke of it as weat her
 was good and we could get through with being a hardship everyone seemed to feel that a car we still
 went to visit them once a week they had a share in fighting the war at home if we left
 on friday afternoon and went by medicine they could not go to the actual war front hat where we stayed
 overnight and then started after some disheartening war news my husout early saturday morning arnving at the camp band told
 me he was going to enlist for active about noon after leaving supplies and getting service i said he surely
 would not leave me with another order we returned by medicine hat again four children one a baby and the
 band of sheep and right on home arnving there about midnight and hired men to look after but he said
 it was the herders spent a very lonely life on the his duty he told me not to have the
 sheep bred prairie but they managed to meet some of the for a year or two and he would order
 feed in case farmers in the district and could spend an evening it was a hard winter once in a
 while they also went to dances at the feed came into burdett and he started alder son and one night
 a snow storm came up hauling just as the last lot was being taken home and they could not manage
 to get back to the camp the hayrack skidded at the turn of the road near before morning when they
 got there they found the house and he was thrown off a bale of hay the sheep had br oken
 out of the corral and many hitting him on the leg and breaking it when the of them had wandered
 away they were later men earned him i using a door for a str etcher found many of them frozen
 to death as the the first thing he said to me was i cannot go ditches in that district had
 some water in them to fight now his leg was broken below the knee from melted snow and the sheep
 stood there till and the knee cap split so he was a lways lame after they fr oze the accident
 the lake which we were told had perpetual we cannot finish this account wit hout thinking springs dried up so
 we had to move again and of the many happy times we had and hoping that returned to the ranch
 we bought a piece of land the kindly spirit of the early settler will not have twelve miles from home
 and successfully drilled entirely passed away but that the younger ones an artesian well so with plenty of leased land
 will carry on they too can do a lot to brighten our troubles were over for a time the lives
 of others if they will only try spilling it out last friday two barr els supposed to contain coal oil
 shipped from winnipeg and assigned to mr curie calgary arived at the station on inspection they were found to contain
 kegs of whiskey which were wedged in with pieces of wood to keep them solid on saturday this whiskey about
 thirty gallons was spilled on the bank of the bow calgary herald may 28 1884 fort fitzgerald affair by donald
 c mckechnie early in 1925 a group of calgary business men a well known engineer and prospector who had formed
 a group which for convenience i will call been engaged in oil explor ation and pr omotion in the calgary
 syndicate they included some the early days of the alberta oil boom from 1914 prominent officials of p burns and
 co some onwards officials of the canadian pacific railway and the next day i met with two members of the
 rb bennett who was destined one day to serve syndicate and mr dunn and was shown his as prime minister
 of canada and who paid reports they were well written brief and to the 25 000 for his share in
 the syndicate their pur point they indicated that in the vicinity of fort pose was to finance a prospecting party
 to go into fitzgerald he had found outcrops of gold bearing northern alberta and the adjacent areas of the rock
 quartz which on assay showed substantial northwest teritories they employed lorne amounts of gold half an ounce per ton the
 dunn a mining engineer nd pr ospector and cliff report sounded optimistic and if true would mdi stevenson of calgary
 to travel by canoe and cate the presence of an important gold bearing prospect in the regions around fort fitzgerald
 and area i asked the syndicate members if they were fort smith prepared to make a deal on the property
 they that fall dunn returned to calgary with reports informed me that they had had some conversaof an important find
 of gold ore just south of fort tions on this matter with another company and fitzgerald on which he had
 staked five or six were awaiting a reply in the meantime they could claims dunn s reports were so impressive
 and not commit themselves well written that the syndicate sent him back by in order to ma ke a complete
 report to cominco plane to stake more claims on his return this time i asked on what terms they were
 considering a he submitted a second report somewhat more dea l it was usual at that time for large companies
 optimistic than the first of more and better gold to buy the whole property for monetary considercontent over substantial widths
 ations their r eply was that when dunn made his first report they were considering asking in december of that
 same year w m archi 5 000 000 but on receiving his second report bald manager of mines for cominco
 visited its which was considerably more optimistic they had sullivan mine at kimberley b c where i was raised the
 price to 6 000 000 i felt that this was on the engineering staff mr archibald told me excessive and
 unrealistic but said nothing i inthat on a recent visit to calgary he had met a we dicated that they
 could hardly expect this to be cole the chief coal mining engineer for the cpr paid down and they agreed
 they suggested that who had informed him about the new gold dis a 50 000 payment be made after an
 examination coveries reported by the calgary syndicate he by a company engineer on the opening of naviintimated that i might
 be asked to go to calgary gation say about the middle of july the matter to examine the reports and
 to see members of the was left there with the understanding that the syn syndicate about making a deal for
 taking over the dicate would notify cominco when as and if they property or an anging further financing but on
 no were prepared to make a deal on returning to circumstance was i to commit the company to any kimberley
 i wrote a report to the cominco substantial expenditure early in january 1926 i was asked to go to cal
 i i mr mckechnie is a mining engineer and geologary to meet members of the syndicate and exa gist who
 has been involved in mining explorations i mine lorne dunn s mining reports i first met throughout canada and other
 parts of the world he i with mr cole who gave me a historical account also was an instnictor in
 geology at laurentian univer i of the syndicate and informed me that dunn was sity and is now retired in
 vancouver manager mr archibald he was as much sur pointed out by mr dunn and had discovered no prised as
 i at such a price based only on a gold ore or anything else of interest they asked prospector s
 r eport if cominco would help to resolve the problem by a few months later i learned that the calgar
 y sending north its assistant superintendent at the syndicate had optioned the property to a group sullivan mine m m
 o brien he was an old ca lled the victoria syndicate and associated friend of mine well known as mel
 with eastern canadian and british companies they had whom i worked on many projects between 1920 decided to start exploration
 work that winter and and 1932 and he told me later that his findings accordingly had contracted with ryan bros
 of confirmed those of the victoria syndicate edmonton to transport four diamond drills sup in his memoirs mr baker spoke
 of the great plies and crew from mcmurray the end of steel swindle and mentioned his under standing to fort
 fitzgerald a distance of about 300 miles that messrs bennett and burns apologized to and in his memoirs peter baker
 stated that the pay offered reimbursement to the victoria syndicate ment was to be 30 000 and that mickie ryan
 but the latter group would not accept any money was to prepare 20 ponies to haul the equipment putting the
 whole affair down to experience in over the ice of the athabasca river to the shores my mind there is
 no doubt that fraud was inof the slave river opposite fort fitzgerald there volved the ore samples were certainly obtained
 he was to place the drills at intervals to await mr elsewhere and the reports were out and out fabri
 dunn s ar ival and further instructions the syn cations the finger points to lorne dunn of dicate members hoped
 that by the middle of may whom baker s stor y provides an interesting they would have had a chance
 to look over the description property to assess its potential for mining develop mr dunn was a ruggedly buili man
 of sirong ment and if it were favourable they would pay opinions and very outspoken he came to my store
 one mr dunn 60 000 and the calgary syndicate day and picked out clothing worth thirty dollars and told me
 to charge it i was impressed and sum he would j pay he asked me if i had staked a
 claim and when i heard nothing further about the operation until i said yes he said you shouldn t have
 it would have early in july when cominco received a letter from been better if you had waited till i
 told you wher e to the calgary syndicate stating that the victoria eventually he went to mcmurray and that was
 the syndicate had done core drilling at the locations last i saw of him he never did pay his account
 at my store r b bennett and pat bums believed him macintosh bell on lead zinc deposits on the south
 because he showed degrees in mining engineenng and shore of great slave lake indicating large geology from the university of
 colorado they secured an aireraft to take him out and back that was the thtrl amounts of broken ore talus
 below ore beanng aeroplane that ever flew north i saw the plane fl ying limestone outcrops i drew these reports
 to the athigh over fitzgerald but it didn t land tention of mr archibald with the result that these cominco
 was more fortunate than baker and lead zinc deposits later came under the control of he two syndicates while i
 was in calgary to talk cominco in the form of pine point mines ltd to he calgary syndicate the cpr
