 ago was no land of frame barns in our region of what is now called central alberta about half way
 between calgary and edmonton timber suitable for logwork was sufficiently plentiful for some thirty miles east of the old trail
 and the railway and anywhere west i did not see my first frame barn anywhere north of the baldheaded country
 until the twentieth century was some four or five years old but we were certainly a community conditions would be
 grossly unjust exof log houses in those days when perience leads me to suggest another central heating was completely outside
 frequently more authentic and much less the orbit of a homesteader s range of invidious reason this was actually the
 thought i knew men who in the more case on my own homestead exposed situations actually preferred a log house
 rather than a less than per my log home for many years was fectly finished frame one i must say
 really and truly the poorest log buildthat i never entered any of the very ing on the place but this
 was for good few early frame houses in the rural areas reason i was actually at work on the without
 thinking what dismal comfort quarter section getting out a set of logs less dens they appeared to be perhaps for
 a house and peeling them as well the very circumstance of a frame house as digging a cellar and breaking
 a small pitched our expectations unreasonably patch of about four acres for some two high they were very seldom painted
 months before we could scare up the and commonly not lath and plastered ten dollars for the homestead entry fee
 until a much later day generally they which should make the place mine alwere unfinished also to anything like though
 i had had my eye on the place the degree necessary to make a winter for some time prior to
 attaining the homehome snug under conditions of stove stead age of eighteen i had been over heating in fact they
 had a name for it only once or twice previously in the being cold as a general point of view
 early spring of 1897 i made a more careful visit of examination this and its one might say that we
 pitied the frame house dweller who was driven to it in purpose were a secret known only to a timberless
 country and scorned the my mother and myself it was not at one who had built of frame because a
 all uncommon for a settler in straits for log house wasn t good enough for him cash to go ahead
 and squat on a homestead even the dominion land regula it has frequently been observed that tions not to say
 customary local opinion a man s log house was quite manifestly regarded him as being entitled to first the poorest

 residence by superior this circumstance has even making his definite home there which given rise to somewhat caustic comment was
 then my precise situation the puton a type of farmer who was much more ting up of even the bare
 walls of a shack concerned about his livestock than about was considered in local opinion to make his wife nobody
 who knows the farm will deny that such men existed yet to the place one s own de facto in

 travel along the side in preference to the centre where the travelling is heavier in the open the snow is

 tents and tepees while bare patches on the ground from which the snow is thawed show where some passing pilgrim

 by the race track is utilized for breaking horses both to ride and drive and the scene it offers is
 not only lively but amusing to the spectator the warm weather of the past week has greatly facilitated the work

 factor by j e a macleod the decades of the 1830 s and 1840 s were the central portion of
 what was probably the greatest period of the hudson s bay company following the merger and reorganization of 1821 under
 the organizing genius of governor simpson the company held undisputed sway over a large part of a continent untroubled alike
 by the earlier commercial competition and the later pressure resulting from the canadian desire for western expansion during this period
 the principal figure among its officers in the great saskatchewan district after john rowand of edmonton was his son in
 law john edward harriott k 4 4 harriott was born in london england in 1797 his mother being a sister
 of john peter pruden for many years an officer of the hudson s bay company probably owing to this connection
 he entered the company s service as an apprentice clerk at the early age of twelve years possibly harriott s
 family connection with the company was closer than that through pruden on october 22 nd 1792 a marriage took place
 at st george s hanover square london between elizabeth harriott and one john hindsley of ellerton yorkshire and the bride
 was supposed by their descendants to have been the daughter of a hudson s bay company s officer however there
 is not in any published material any mention of an earlier harriott in the company s service and the supposition
 may be based upon the connection with the company through pruden the young apprentice clerk came to the bay in
 the summer of 1809 on the company s ship king george he spent the first season probably at york factory
 and the next two years there or somewhere on the saskatchewan from outfit 1813 14 until that of 1826 27
 with one interruption while a member of the bow river expedition he was at fort carlton during all this period
 his uncle john peter pruden was in charge of this post except for the season 1824 25 when he was
 absent on sick leave chief factor harriot after his retirement and his place was taken by chief factor john stuart
 in 1816 17 during his service at carlton harriott s apprenticeship ended and he became a full clerk the author
 of the biographical note on harriott in the appendix the robertson letters 1 quotes from an unnamed source the statement
 that harriott in 1818 was a promising and interested young man who h b rec soc pub vol ii 216

 and served as its president and strongest supporter during its existence in the 1920 s he has also made a
 study of piegan past on the bow river spoke fluent cree and was much beloved edmonton to fort vancouver in
 the by the natives appointments for 1828 29 harriott s name appears only in the general colum harriott was selected
 as one of the bia list but in the minutes of the next eight clerks to take part in the
 bow year his name is in the new caledonia river expedition of 1822 23 under the list as chief trader
 a rank to which he command of chief factor donald mc had been promoted in 1829 harriott kenzie and chief
 trader john rowand apparently stayed west of the mountains during this expedition harriott led a for these two years but
 he was present party to the marias river in the present by invitation as a chief trader at the state
 of montana a territory towards meeting of the council at york factory which the american traders were ad in july
 1830 at that meeting he was vancing his selection to lead this party again appointed to the columbia district as
 well as his inclusion in the personnel and was second in command to chief of the important bow river expedition
 factor mclaughlin at fort vancouver would indicate that he was well thought of by his superiors harriott married his cousin

 7 1887 how the bible game to the gree by bruce peel in the mid nineteenth century the cree nation
 lived in scattered bands throughout a broad belt of woodlands stretching from james bay westward to the rockies they were
 a people without a written language until the ingenuity of the rev james evans provided them with a script the
 invention of the cree syllabary gave an impetus to the work of translating the scriptures and other devotional literature into
 cree and other indian dialects throughout the canadian northwest in this paper it is proposed to tell something of the
 work of the translators and printers who provided the cree with a literature james evans was not the first missionary
 to reduce an indian language to written form but whereas most other missionary philologists had used the roman alphabet 2
 evans used symbols to represent syllables and produced a script so simple that any unlettered indian could master it within
 days thus the indians could teach one another and the knowledge of cree syllabic spread from band to band missionary
 work among a scattered and nomadic people was understandably slow but with the invention of the syllabic script the missionary
 could extend the influence of his teachings far beyond his missionary station mr evans invented the cree syllabic script in
 1840 within a few months of his appointment by the wesleyan missionary society of england to the position of superintendent
 of missions for the hudson s bay territories he used a variety of triangles angles and pothooks at first ten
 in number but later reduced to nine each with four positions up down left and right to depict the thirty
 six open vowel sounds which largely constitute the musical language of the cree thus an acute angle with open angle
 up down left and right represented pay pe po pah respectively in addition to these symbols evans used a number
 of accentlike marks to indicate consonants used as terminals the use of each of the nine symbols in four different
 positions gave the syllabary a mnemonic quality which helps to explain its success the new superintendent of missions established his
 headquarters near norway house north of lake winnipeg and 11 ev a nes evans invented the cree syllabic script in
 1840 the simple characters did much to assist early missionaries in translating the scriptures i bibjiographical details about the volumes

 in the head office of the indian department at regina in 1885 and it fell to my lot to open
 the mail index all the letters and hand them over to the accountant who in turn examined them and dealt
 with them as he saw fit one day i went into his office and said i see the indian agent
 on the blackfoot reserve is asking for an assistant to look after the clerical work of the agency further i
 said that the indian commissioner had told us in the general office that if we wanted promotion in the service
 we should go out to the reserves and learn how to deal with the indians i said if no one
 else applied for the position i would be glad to accept it he assured me that he would notify the
 commissioner accordingly ven archdeacon francis cole cornish d d was born in south wales in 1865 and caine to western
 canada in 1885 as an employee for the indian department in regina later in the year he was appointed clerk
 at the black foot agency and then as agent for the stonies and sarcees ivest of calgary he became agent
 for the ojibways near fort francis but in 1896 he decided to leave the civil service to become an anglican
 mninister he served for a timne in saskatchewan before taking a parish in edmonton at the turn of the centary
 when he retired in 1939 he moved to victoria and now lives at 904 falmouth road he is 93 years
 old this year his memoirs were prepared for the glenbow foundation calgary and are published with their consent became police
 commissioner in cal of rations canning by name went with gary me he went to a friendly indian s how
 well i can remember watching tepee but the greeting was very cold the gallant force through my bedroom we decided
 that we were not wanted window one very cold morning when so we jumped on our ponies and rode led
 by colonel irvine they marched past home next morning we discovered the on the road to batoche where louis riel
 reason for the cool reception we were was encamped with his army of sup on our way to the cook
 house for breakporters to a newcomer from the old fast when we noticed that the indians sod it was a
 sight to be remembered had all returned to their respective vila hundred brave and disciplined men lages what had happened
 ordinarily riding on splendid horses clothed in they would not have done so for some their buffalo coats and on
 the war path weeks we discovered that they had afterwards i saw them many times as received word of riel
 s capture hours they visited the blackfoot reserve and before we did they had scouts all the was always impressed
 with their ap way from their reserve to the front of pearance the fighting and were kept well informed of
 what was taking place before the capture of riel and while the struggle was in a fluid state the a
 description of the agency buildofficials on the reserves had to do all ings of that day would be a good
 illustrain their power to keep the indians in a tian of the change that has come about peaceful frame of
 mind and this was in the passing years the shack in which not an easy task for example in the
 agent and i lived was a very indifordinary times only the squaws came for ferent log building chinked with mud
 their rations of beef and flour but dur and with a roof of poles covered with ing this particular time
 the male indians sods and loose earth this building did it each bringing his rifle and a belt about 12
 by 20 feet was divided into or two of cartridges with him at that two roams one was the agent
 s bedtime the blackfeet sarcees peigans and room while the other was one in which bloods could have easily mustered
 a i slept on a cot but which served as the couple of thousand able bodied males office as well
 here the business was well mounted and with plenty of am transacted and as the indians came and munition needless
 to say the officials went at all hours of the day the atmosneeded lots of patience and diplomacy phere at
 times was such that it necessi much help was given by church mis tated our keeping the door open for
 sionaries on the different reserves and ventilation notably by rev john mcdougall of mar the roof on the inside was
 covered ley he and his stoney indians did a with cheese cloth to make the room look lot of useful
 scouting for the government more modern in the course of time and were loyal to a man rev father the
 sods on the roof became dry and lacombe frequently visited the great inclined to make dust in spots this was
 blackfoot chief crowfoot and his tribe noticeable in the form of bag shaped and it was my duty to meet
 him at the pockets of dirt when we thought it was railway siding and bring him down to getting dangerous
 we cut through the the reserve and take him back on his cheese cloth with a knife and gathered return
 to calgary the dry dust in a bucket the floors were on the north blackfaot reserve was just rough planks
 and i had to become archdeacon tims whose work and in an expert with the corn broom fluence cannot be
 over estimated in it will be understood therefore that each case these men were masters of when distinguished figures visited
 the the indian language and had won the agency in the summer weather permittrust and affection of the indians ting
 we would suggest it would be more in the spring of 1885 while the rebel comfortable to sit on chairs
 and enjoy lion was still on the blackfoot indians the sun and incidentally to view the gathered as they always
 did for their beautiful bow river as it rushed swiftly annual sun dance one sunday after by a few feet
 from the shack noon i rode up to the camp to see for not long afterwards the agency was myself
 what was going on the issuer moved some miles farther west and new i told him of their demands and
 he advised me to let them have same supplies and to report it to the agent on his return so
 the instructor issued them what they wanted a few minutes later one of the indians returned to demand more supplies
 he could speak a little english and i was able to make him understand that i would not give him
 any more and that i would report their conduct to the agent this incident showed that the indians were not
 in a normal state of mind at that particular period and some leniency had to be shown probably white pup
 thought it was a good time to frame buildings were erected for the agent and for the assistant as well
 as the necessary warehouse and stables there were many events not always pleasant which happened to me during the rebellion
 one afternoon in the absence of the agent i was seated at my office desk when i heard the sound
 of galloping horses which grew louder and louder until finally i found myself in the midst of some thirty indians
 led by minor chief white pup somewhat excited they rushed through the door without so much as saying by your
 leave i asked white pup what he meant by this rude behaviour and was informed that they had come for
 beef tea try out the young clerk who had recently come to live amongst them it ended in white pup
 being reduced to the rank of an ordinary indian as far as i can remember the indians generally did not
 agree with him or his conduct another incident during the rebellion which caused me some anxious moments occurred when i
 was riding with the cowboys on their daily errand of driving the steers to the slaughter pens at both the
 north and south camps on alternate days the agent had received orders to send me to check these daily killings
 as to the weight and quality of beef and tobacco it was a demand not a request and i knew
 the agent would not be pleased at this behaviour on the part of a minor chief however whilst i was
 thinking things aver the farming instructor who had seen the indians galloping towards the agency came to the office and
 asked what they wanted delivered it was on one of these trips that the incident happened it took place at
 the north camp just after we had driven the steers into the corral the cowboys and i were on our
 horses when some difference arose between the foreman and an indian whom we called tony he was a line specimen
 of an indian and as a rule very friendly so i was amazed when i heard angry words between him
 and the foreman i was especially worried when i heard the cowboy tell him if you move another foot i
 will shoot knowing the cowboy as i did and realizing the seriousness of the situation i was most relieved when
 the indian ceased to advance and his good judgment prevailed i enjoyed working with the cowboys very much including a
 daily ride of ten miles to the south camp and four miles to the north camp the cowboy camp was
 close to the new agency buildings so i spent many pleasant times there being the third man on the drive
 i was able to take the centre while the cow white pup a blackfoot minor chief gave the young agency
 clerk a problem in 1885 when he demanded extra rations for himself and warriors he is seen here with his
 young wife shortly after the riel rebellion boys took the right and left flanks in naturally curious to see the
 soldier who this way i was able to be of some help had commanded the force that had de i
 remember another incident on the feated and captured louis riel the blackfoot reserve when an attempt was general was dressed
 in civilian clothes made on the part of the mounted police and i believe the indians would have to arrest
 an indian who some years been more impressed if he had been in previously had escaped from jail at fort
 military uniform however the general macleod and fled to the united states and crowfoot had a good pow wow and
 after a period of time he had returned i think crowfoot appreciated the fact to canada and sought refuge on
 the that his representative of the queen had blackfoot reserve the indians on the come to see the blackfoot tribe
 reserve stated openly that they would the next visit was one which i renot let their friend be captured by
 the gret i was not able to photograph it police but the indians were informed was the visit of the
 governor general that nothing would stop the police from the marquis of lansdowne i have dedoing their duty scribed the
 log building which we called this made the matter serious so much the agency so it is not surprising that
 so that the indian commissioner made we entertained his excellency on the a special visit to the blackfoot agency lawn
 our only two chairs which were to see crowfoot and his indians he not of the chesterfield variety were was
 in the hope that after due con placed close to the shack for the sideration the escaped prisoner would governor
 general and crowfoot be persuaded to give himself up and i had previously had the pleasure of accept whatever punishment
 the court meeting the marquis at rideau hall thought advisable the indian was will when i first came to canada
 i had ing to meet the commissioner but on brought a letter of introduction to his one condition that he
 was not to be excellency from the home secretary arrested at the moment of the commis lord aberdare whom i
 had met at a sioner s visit and not until the commis garden party upon hearing that i was sioner
 had left the reserve leaving for canada he had given me a the mounted police were notified letter of introduction
 which in due accordingly and a few days later the course i left at the governor general s forces from
 fort macleod and calgary residence registering according to protwo hundred strong met at the black tocol a few days afterwards
 i was foot crossing with a couple of seven invited to dinner at government house pounders all ready for a
 show of lust before the guests were leaving the strength but the prisoner had disap a d c came to
 me and said his excelpeared and the police had to return lency would like to speak to me i went
 without their man to the end of the room and shook hands it was a rare sight to see so
 many with him and his family after a few mounted police at one time and i often kind words of
 welcome i left for my wonder if there are many others alive cousin s home in ottawa where i stayed
 today who have seen such a sight for six weeks before leaving for the west the indian in question gave
 himself the visit of the governor general to up to the police a year or two after the blackfoot reserve
 was one of the wards he was presumably a blood outstanding incidents in my experiences indian as i know he
 did not belong to there it was a scene which i could the blackfoot tribe the troop from cal never
 forget one which made a great gary was under the command of col impression on me at the time and
 which herchmer and the one from fort macleod i have always remembered the disunder cal cotton there was no excite
 tinguished visitor came by special train ment over the affair probably we knew from calgary accompanied by lieut in our
 own minds that the indian would gay dewdney and his staff they were beat a hasty retreat to his friends
 across met by some five hundred indians on the line their ponies at the railway siding now after the rebellion
 one of the first known as cluny but then only inhabited visitors to the agency was general f by a
 trader who did business with the d middleton and the indians were indians the scene quickly grew in uiu u
 6 1 iss pn s 5 4 s impressiveness as fifty north west mounted police unloaded their horses and headed
 the procession en route to the agency some three or four miles distant what a sight it was to see
 these men in their uniforms helmet and scarlet tunics each carrying his rifle and all astride choice horses splendidly looked
 after and especially spic and span for the occasion so the procession started led by the famous mounted police two
 by two in faultless order then followed the governor general and his a d c s in a carriage flanked
 by some five hundred mounted indians evenly divided on each side of the carriage each indian with his rifle and
 garbed in the familiar blanket after the governor general came the lieutenant governor and his staff then the commissioner of
 the mounted police and several officers from regina and calgary this made quite a long procession the indian officials waiting
 at the agency were magnus begg the agent and myself george h wheatley the farm instructor canning the issuer of
 rations and dan martin who looked after farming operations and helped to teach the science of agriculture to the one
 time buffalo hunters we waited and watched as we were able to see the procession gradually making itself more and
 more visible as it moved along the sloping prairie and approached the agency building waiting with us was crowfoot who
 was seated in his chair ready to greet the representative of the great white mother the governor general and crowfoot
 shook hands and took their seats then much to the surprise of everybody especially the mounted police the indians fired
 a royal salute and the order stand at ease put everybody in the position of spectators all eyes were directed
 towards the two great leaders and all listened to what they had to say the governor general expressed his great
 pleasure at meeting crowfoot and assured him that the government valued highly his great influence during the rebellion in helping
 to keep the peace in his part of the dominion crowfoot always dignified and never given to many words thanked
 the governor crowfoot great chief of the blackfoot was much admired by archdeacon cornish during his years as an agency
 clerk general and hoped he would be pleased at what he saw and would enjoy his visit to the blackfoot
 reserve after the pow wow presents were given to the indians by the governor general and these were supplemented by
 extra rations of beef tea and tobacco they had a most enjoyable time and indeed it was a great welcome
 from a great indian chief to an equally great statesman after louis riel s capture several of the rebel leaders
 had to pay with their lives for the trouble they had caused others among them the well known chief poundmaker
 were sent to stony mountain penitentiary it was not long before prison life began to have a serious citizens according
 to the press of that effect on the health of these indians day the people who attended the recepand it
 became a problem for the govern tion were much struck by the dignified ment if the indians were allowed to
 manner of crowfoot who acted as if die in jail the effect on the indians he had been quite familiar
 with such generally might have led to further proceedings he was one of nature s trouble statesmen and could act
 the part splendidly the indians received many consequently in july 1885 when presents and mrs crowfoot was not foragain i
 was compelled to act in the gotten for she showed me a dress which absence of the agent a telegram
 reached had been given her it was completely me from ottawa it said that if crow covered with dollar bills
 which she had foot would petition the government for sewn onto it the release of these indians it was altogether
 probable the petition would be i remember the day on which they granted i immediately sent for crow returned to
 the agency and have not foot and explained the nature of the forgotten the embrace crowfoot gave me telegram to
 him he gladly agreed to when we met in the agent s home i the proposal we drafted the message
 think it showed conclusively that he had read it to crowfoot and got him to sign a sincere affection for
 those whom he it by holding the pen and making his could trust and i am sure he felt the
 mark x in true legal fashion this same towards the officials generally petition was read in the house of com
 crowfoot s influence on the reserve mans and approved unanimously the was felt on more than one occasion indians were
 released from jail and i recall shortly after the return of the everyone was happy mounted police from their participation
 in may 1886 when again i was in in crushing the rebellion some of the charge while the agent was
 away on indians had killed some cattle on the business a code wire reached me to open prairie they found
 their way home the effect that poundmaker and some to the reserve hoping to hide and elude thirty of his
 tribe were on their way to the police and escape being arrested and the blackfoot reserve and that i should
 punished keep careful watch and report accord some forty mounted police under ingly it was not long before we heard
 inspector moodie arrived at the agency of poundmaker s arrival and got in touch with orders to arrest the men
 the with him and crowfoot we were as indians had said they would not allow sured that it was only
 a friendly visit the police to take them in it was shortly on the part of poundmaker and reported after
 resting for a noon time meal after to the government to that effect a long ride of some sixty miles
 from poundmaker never returned to his calgary that the police mounted their home but died on the blackfoot reserve horses
 and rode to the place where the joe scott and i made a coffin of lumber indians were hiding in
 some scrub alongcovered with cotton and brass tacks side the trail the interpreter billy poundmaker s body was laid to
 rest with gladstone informed the inspector that the indian s assortment of blankets every one of his men was a
 marked man rifles ammunition knives and tobacco if the police opened fire to speed him on his way to the
 happy once again discretion was the better hunting ground he was very like part of valour and the men were
 ordered crowfoot in appearance and as far as to remount and proceed to their barracks i could judge a good
 type of indian in calgary the agent immediately sent as a result of the rebellion the for crowfoot and after
 a thorough in government decided to send crowfoot vestigation into the whole situation and other chiefs from treaty seven to
 crowfoot persuaded the guilty indians eastern canada in 1886 to see for them to go to calgary admit their guilt
 and selves the progressive spirit of the white surrender to the police this they did man and what he had
 accomplished and as far as i can recall they were they arrived in montreal and attended not punished severely if
 at all a reception at the windsor hotel which there was another instance howwas largely attended by many leading ever
 when the picture was very different it embraced many indians and one show me the man said the serpoliceman with
 his interpreter billy geant and the interpreter pointed him gladstone i quite forget what indian out he calmly took the
 indian by his the mounted policeman was after but arm led him to his horse threw him onto the interpreter
 knew and was able to the saddle and left for calgary there take the sergeant to the house where was
 not a murmur from the indian shack he was hiding it was full of indians sufficient time had elapsed after
 the reprobably some twenty of them when the bellion for the excitement to fade away mounted policeman rapped on the
 door and the indians were given time to there was silence within the shack realize that both indians and whites
 had and no welcome come in beside the to obey the law and that the police did door was an

 mountain chief mountain a massive collection of huge rocks rising up as its name implies is a chief among its
 giant brethren situated as it is with the international boundary line dividing it in two it makes a conspicious landmark
 and the one half clasping hands and joining itself to its american cousin makes a fit simile for the bond
 of union and brotherly feeling existing between these two great countries previous to 1863 there was a cap projecting from
 its summit something similar to the horn of a saddle but in that year the cap fell giving the tap
 a flat and solid looking appearance chief mountain was so called by the indians from the fact of its standing
 out by itself somewhat in advance of the main range it rises a sheer precipice on all sides to an
 immense height except on the west side where a narrow hog s back runs up to the summit the mountain
 can be seen for a distance of 200 miles oran duntley alias clean jack pursued a band of elk up
 the side of this mountain and ran them over the precipice no doubt there are many people who are not
 familiar with the origin of the name of pincher creek it is of course a small matter in itself and
 simply illustrates the source of many strange and unaccountable names and what trivial circumstances will often lead to the baptism
 of places who names often cling to them to the end of time in august 1868 a party came out
 here prospecting with four wagons and all the necessary outfit they were camped on pincher creek when one of their
 number joe kipp lost his pincers the party then proceeded to the porcupine hills and joe returned daily to look
 for his pincers from his repeated visits and the object of his search it gradually assumed the name it has
 at present and probably will retain the same throughout the coming ages the same party after prospecting some time in
 the porcupine hills at the head of high river discovered color in the crevices in the rocks they sunk a
 shaft forty eight feet but reached no bed rock encountering clay all the way down the party returned from the
 porcupines and four of them wintered at chief mountain lee harness keller and juno lee s creek near the st
 mary s river takes its name from the former of these men lee was killed afterwards while travelling from standoff
 to whoop up it is supposed that the horses balked with him near whoop up and that taking out his
 pistol to hit one of them it went off and shot him in the groin fort macleod gazette oct 4
 1882 news from fort macleod fort maclead oct 17 1881 the first installment of sullen winter lies heavy and threatening
 on our yet verdant grass and trees even at this early date it consists of about one foot of snow
 whilst the thermometer sometimes ranges from 15 to 20 degrees blow zero nature itself seems astonished and the wild fowl
 such correct judges of the signs of the times have suddenly stopped in their airy flight to feed by the
 hundred on crops which men sowed by sweat of their brow and are prevented from reaping by an opposite temperature
 so far the only store in fort maclead is almost empty and how it is to be furnished seems a
 problem some teams from helena and benton have come in with indian flour after much hard pulling through the snow
 it is feared that all of the indian supplies cannot be furnished this winter and the produce of the indians
 farms will not be sufficient to feed them one month no one living can tell the consequence which hunger amongst
 the indians would entail in their present mood for my own part it is not without some anxiety that i
 look forward to the severe months which are still ahead of us the great excitement just now is the pending
 trial of the supposed murderer of greyburn star child a blood the jury have received their charge from the judge
 and have been under lock and key for the last ten hours apparently unable to come to an agreement the
 trial of star child in the greyburn case already referred to is now over the jury have acquitted him for
 want of sufficient evidence the principal proofs brought forward against him were that he had been seen around the place
 about the time greyburn was killed that around the body of the murdered man were found the tracks of an
 indian pony that the bullet extracted from the dead body was found to correspond with those used by star child
 when taken prisoner and something claimed to have been told by the prisoner to another indian shortly after the murder
 but which he denied in court the police are very naturally shocked that the murderer of their companion has not
 yet been brought to justice and indeed it is to be regretted that the real culprit cannot be found and
 punished if the severity of the approaching winter be at all proportioned to that of the present storm it will
 be a hard trial on the large herds of stock cattle recently brought here and many hundreds may succumb being
 altogether unacclimated such an occurrence would be very regettable as it would tend to discourage new beginners in the business
 and prevent others from coming in immediately although it is evident that our country will be greatly benefitted by the
 influx of rich capitalists who are now turning their attention on it yet it is to be feared that there
 will be a tendency to monopolize with the present system of land lease and that the large capitalists will endeavor
 to eat up the small ones or as some of the former have already expressed it freeze them out this
 would be one of the greatest evils which could happen to the northwest for it is not the man who
 is already rich and by taking up a whole stretch of country employs a few laborers to the exclusion of
 everybody else in order to become more so but the poor man whose industry has free scope who accumulates property
 and rises gradually by dint of hard labor and the sweat of his brow thus bringing forth ever yhidden treasure
 of the soil on which he lives that builds up a great and prosperous nation however i think our vigilant
 magistrate col macleod will strain every nerve to protect the rights of those first pioneers who with himself bore the
 burden of hardship when the country was yet in a very crude state published in the benton weekly record mont
