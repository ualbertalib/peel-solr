 parents two sisters and three grew knee deep in most districts a brothers from collingwood ont to a prairie fire
 in those days with no prohomestead a few miles east of lacombe tective barriers such as roads or fields i
 am happy to say however i have never could be very dangerous on more than regretted the call of the
 west and one occasion i helped to save a homethe move we made in the spring of 1892 steader s
 buildings by hurriedly break the years that followed brought hard ing a few furrows from where a backships worse than
 anything i experienced fire could be started wild game such in the hungry thirties through it all as ducks and
 prairie chicken supplied by hard work and the will to succeed the early settlers with much of their food we
 managed to build a farm that later berries grew in abundance especially gave us a decent living schools were raspberries
 and saskatoons unlike tofew and far apart and open for the day gophers were almost as scarce as summer months
 only by regular at the settlers tendance and lots of home work i managed to complete the first five on
 leaving vegreville we travelled along the c n r survey line and after grades three days of pretty tough going
 arrived in the fall of 1902 my oldest brother at the present townsite of vermilion the harry worked on the
 c n r survey be chief survey engineer had told my tween north battleford and edmonton brother that when the
 railroad came he was much impressed with the land through a divisional point would be in that territory and the
 opportunities established here it looked to us like it afforded for large scale development the ideal spot to start up
 some kind of on his return home in the spring of 1903 business enterprise we decided to put he and
 i talked it over and decided to up camp and look around for suitable move up around what is now
 the ver homestead land milion district jack bristow later well known islay blacksmith and h mc vermilion at that time
 was in sas gowan also decided to come along katchewan a fact that is not generally with four horses two
 hitched to a known today the boundary line separatwagon and two trailing behind we ing the territories of alberta and
 sasmoved north to edmonton where we katchewan ran a few miles west of stayed a month before proceeding on manville
 it was not until 1905 when east the trail at that time took us by the two provinces were formed
 that the way of fort saskatchewan and beaver boundary line was established at the fourth meridian lake a few settlers
 of ukrainian descent had already moved in around mundare harry filed on a homestead in what vegreville at that time
 was pre is now boredale district the land in dominately french and consisted of a the immediate vicinity of vermilion
 licensed hotel a general store and a seemed a bit too stony and there were livery barn plenty of good
 quarters to choose from the country for about forty miles farther out a school was later built from edmonton was
 thickly wooded near his land and named bowtell in his but farther east it was mostly wide honor that same
 year i filed on a homeopen prairie in fact there is more stead a mile west of what is now
 the bush around the lloydminster dis robertson farm on highway 16 mr peterson a resident of edmonton is author of
 the fascinating eye witness account of the fro lake massacre which he wrote in 1931 after interviewing a cree named
 george stanley this was published in the autumn 1955 issue of the review 41 r peterson has now prepared an
 article on fred bowtell s reminscences in the vermilion district on harry s land we built a two storey was
 nothing to do but camp in our tracks hostelry with logs drawn from the river no bush or homesteader s
 shack was in valley close by a store and post office sight to save us from freezing to death named
 breage was put up with mat we used part of the sleigh box for fire brimacombe as the first postmaster
 i wood by morning the storm had abated made two trips to edmonton on horse and we managed to drive
 on till we came back for the mail besides bringing out to a house i forget the name of the
 freight in the winter with team and people who lived there but the lady of sleigh the only stopping place
 along the house certainly made us comfortthe way east of vegreville was at mr able with a good hot meal
 my feet lavoy s where a town later sprung up were frost bitten and i was in considerbearing his name
 able pain for the next couple of days after a few hours sleep we proceeded the first settlers in the
 vermilion district to my recollection were geo on our way thankful to be alive after such a harrowing experience powell
 and mr evans who both operated horse ranches a few miles by 1903 a few homesteaders had northeast of the
 present town another drifted in to the vermilion district but rancher i knew well was mr bowess the real rush
 didn t start until the folwho was the first homesteader in the lowing year we moved the hostelry manville district
 the miller bros from breage to where the town of ver high and alex were among the first milion now
 stands i also built a livery pioneers to settle in the lloydminster barn to take care of the increasing numarea
 i well remember high with his her of horses the settlers brought in the long bushy moustache and his ability
 next year brothers frank and art arto spit tobacco juice farther than any rived from lacombe frank operated a man
 around stage coach between vegreville and in 1903 the barr colony of over 1 500 lloyd and also did considerable
 land men women and children was estab guiding later he moved to dinwoody lished in the lloydminster area this where
 wainwright now stands art was was a tremendous undertaking too telegraph operator at lloyd from 1907 much credit cannot be
 given the late to 1911 he was transferred to mooswa bishop lloyd for his untiring efforts on now called lindberg
 on the st paul behalf of the colony not only in a branch of the c n r and stayed
 there spiritual way but for his practical help as government telegraph agent for the in providing food clothing and shelter
 next fifteen years one incident that stands out clearly in the winter of 1904 i freighted lumin my mind was
 a trip i made from lloyd her from fort pitt to lloydminster which to battleford in the fall of 1904
 some was rapidly taking shape as a good sized body had taken a shot at mr barr and town though
 still without the services i received a hurry up call to take a mr of a railway i also made
 several trips reddington down for the trial he was to edmonton for freight for the miller a witness to the
 shooting which ap bros who had started a general store parently had been committed in a fit of in town
 that summer i brought to the anger at the way mr barr had handled vermilion district four families includthe affairs
 of the colony we left with ing the robertsons and tom sherwood team and buggy about eight o clock in
 by this time duggan mcphail had started the morning and arrived at battleford a stopping place at manville and we
 the same day while it was still daylight often stayed there overnight it seems almost unbelievable that a team a
 well known pioneer of the grizzly of horses could cover almost 100 miles bear district was henry myers better in
 about 14 hours but in those days known as cayuse myers everybody anything was possible knew cayuse and his horse
 trading another incident i shall never forget ability unfortunately a cyclone ripped happened in the winter of 1904 mr through
 his ranch and killed three of lawrence and i were proceeding from his children i later worked for henry vermilion
 to lloyd when a terrific storm and can truly say he was one of the blew up the temperature went
 down finest men i have ever met i might to around forty below and we were cam also mention here
 that until recently pletely lost night came on and there the well known bronco busting horses from the myers ranch

 range the winter of 1906 07 was just the reverse with snow still on the ground there was great rejoicing
 when the in the middle of may i didn t think steel was laid and the first train came i
 would live to see another one like it through vermilion had a small boom but after half a century have
 now exas homesteaders flocked in by the hun perienced a winter that for severity and dreds settlements sprang up all

 s first roundup the pincher creek round up began on the 20 th june 1882 they started at kipp between
 the old man s and belly river and dividing into three parties followed up the belly kootenai waterton and old
 man s river the latter party leaving the river at the piegan reserve and joining the other parties they then
 went from the kootenai to the piegan reserve and drove to pincher creek after this the south fork of the
 old man s was visited and the whole herd driven between mill and pincher creeks where it will be divided
 into three different bands before branding the following is pretty nearly the programme after the branding mr lee will cut
 out his cattle from the main band and drive them to the south fork mr a lachapelle will next cut
 out turning his entire band over to muirhead co who have bought them at 35 per head and they will
 drive this band to their ranche on belly river which they purchased from mr w olen and where they have
 five hundred acres under fence major shurtliff will then cut out and turn his count over to the company in
 which he is interested messrs ives sharp will cut out the government cattle and count them the following gentlemen will
 probably after cutting out and branding their cattle leave them on the range messrs smith stewart steed brunskell and geddes
 garnett bros brensan co and j johnson this is the first regularly organized round up which has taken place and
 we hope that it will be a precursor of a strong and compact cattle association such as is in existence
 in montana there is an immense number of stock in this section now and these thoroughly organized round up parties
 are a matter of necessity we are informed that the pincher creek cattle are in splendid condition and we can
 easily believe this as that country can hold its own with any of these parts all of which are hard
 to beat fort macleod gazette july 1 1882 early high river and the whiskey traders by philip weinard high river
 previous to 1882 was it was the custom of the early traders known chiefly as a good trading camp to
 leave fort benton montana in time by the old whiskey traders and a good to reach here before winter set
 in they winter hunting ground by the indians always made it a point to consult the ask any old indians
 of the blackfoot chief of the various tribes as to where tribe what part of the country the buf the
 camp would be for the winter which falo liked best and he will tell you from of course depended on
 where the most high river south as far as the missouri buffalo were river west as far as the mountains
 and for instance if the large herd was east as far as the bow river of course at or near
 high river then the there were small bunches scattered all greater camp would be at high through the country river
 if on the other hand the buf wherever there was lab were more or less scattered befeed water and tween
 high river and belly river shelter but the large then there would be a camp of herd usually wint bloods
 probably on belly river ered in the foothills peigans on oldman river while the from high river blackfeet would be
 camped on high south river the traders would always high river was the favorite camping make preparations accordingly ground of
 the blackfeet although visited they always had to work and trade by the stonies and sarcees as well as in
 harmony with one another for mutual the bloods and peigans kipp on the old protection whenever they intended man river
 whoop up on the st mary staying in one place all winter it was and standoff on belly river were
 the the custom to choose a good spot near principal trading posts in the south while water and heavy timber
 where they high river had that distinction in the would build a cabin and stockade the north the great medicine

 one indian could trade at one in the old days two large trunks were time he entered a narrow lean

 are the stories told by the old was built in december 1872 by howell harris indians about this old fort
 when it was and asa sample stocked with whiskey i knew personally 2 if this dale is correct the author
 is likely referring several of the old traders in montana to employees of the american fur co at fort before
 i came up here and who helped benton who annually took wagon loads of goods into indian territory to trade
 in the camps how to build the fort and who were here as ever no trading posts were built in
 southern alberta early as 1858 by americans at that early date this article is a condensation of several letters written
 by philip weinard to the provincial archives in 1908 and 1909 as the original settler on the present townsite of
 high river the author was able to give a c ear picture of life in the pioneer era born at
 bitburg prussia in 1864 weinard moved to minneapolis at the age of eight the indians used to come down the
 mississipi and camp near my home he recalled i spent hours in their camps their free life appealed to me
 so strongly that in ‘ 79 in company with two other boys i ran away from home and came west
 of the missouri being always in good health and full of vigor i lost no time in gaining experience and
 learning of men and things as few of my age ever learned in that length of time he came to
 alberta with a bull tea n in 1882 and was a pioneer resident of high river the side of the
 cabin just wide enough hudson s bay and the n w fur co with for one person and just high
 enough to their small capital they had to risk their stand up in at the farther end would lives in
 order to get any trade whiskey be a small opening leading into the was the only article they could handle
 cabin about four feet from the ground profitably although they traded tea and just large enough to take in a
 robe tobacco blankets powder etc the or hand out a small keg 2 the usual indians preferred whiskey to anything
 trade would be a 1 gal keg of whiskey else and as a matter of course it became for a
 good large robe of course it varied the chief stock in trade sometimes a robe would be secured for allow
 me to suggest that the a tin cupfull early traders deserve recognition as when the traders visited small camps the
 real pathfinders and trail in outlying districts they never gave as blazers they risked their lives at much as at
 the fort they would drive every turn in those days when only to the camp usually with a four horse
 indians and buffalo occupied these wagon pitch their camp at or near the vast plains indian camp and invite trade
 by giving they did not trade whiskey through the chief or head man a bottle of fire choice it was
 forced on them in order to water when they got started trade get trade i have nothing to say in
 would continue brisk until either the defence of those who continued after the robes or whiskey gave out police arrived
 they were a different it always required three men at least class of men to trade at a camp in
 the open one when the n w m police arrived in the would do the trading the other would country
 in the early 70 s and declared watch the whiskey while the third would whiskey trading illegal most of the
 old watch the robes that were traded for it traders left or settled down with an was no easy task
 to keep the squaws indian wife near some police barracks from stealing back the robes their lord in the employ
 of the government or took and master had parted with for a little up a claim on a future cattle
 ranch whiskey and which took them several others kept on as long as they could days of the hardest toil
 to produce it smuggling in whiskey and keeping out was a common occurence to have them of the way of
 the police whiskey tradgathered around the pile of robes watch ing ceased entirely with the indians in ing their chance
 to grab one and make ‘ 79 when the buffalo went south never their escape in the darkness it would
 to return the whole of the n w t was often happen that the same robes would put under prohibition
 with the arrival pass through the trader s hands twice of the police and whiskey trading pracin the same night
 although one man tically ceased but whiskey smuggling would sit on the pile with his rifle he continued until the
 licensing law went dare not use it into effect in 1894 sometimes a drunken brave s heart when the buffalo
 went south in ‘ 79 would get very bad he would spit in the and ‘ 80 little did the
 indians dream that trader s face call him a dog take a keg their last big hunt in the n
 w t was of whiskey and walk away at another over and it wouldn t have been except time they
 would take everything the for the hard winter of ‘ 80 and ‘ 81 it traders had except their horses
 and was the hardest winter in the west for wagon and tell them to go the traders many years and
 drove the buffalo usually obeyed in a hurry farther south than usual they became weak and were an easy prey
 for the they were always well armed but used their weapons only as a last resort 3 for the plan
 of a whiskey post of this description to defend their lives their calling was see the winter 1956 issue for
 donald graham s the most hazardous and dangerous in the sketch of a post at calgary in 1872 west and
 only the brave were successful the author is perhaps taking too lenient a view of the whole whiskey trading era
 while many some of the early traders were not only traders did come within his description others brave but men
 of good character and were of a poor class of frontiersmen two examples sterling worth their calling was not are
 the deaths of 70 bloods in drunken quarrels commendable yet it was their only in one winter and the attitude
 expressed by a wolfer to a white traveller that if he had been either means of making a living in
 competition a half breed or an indian he would have shot against such strong companies as the without hesitation hunters
 along the yellowstone who killed them all winter for their hides alone i went down the yellowstone in the spring
 of ‘ 81 and from huntley above the mouth of the big horn river down to the missouri were stacks
 of hides piled up like cord wood along the river bank at different points awaiting shipment by steamboat to bismark
 i ran on the first steamboat that came up and made several trips i know for a positive fact that
 over 100 000 hides were taken down the river to say nothing of those that were held in the country
 for robes and other uses those that escaped slaughter and the hard winter about 50 000 wintered north of the
 missouri river and on my way to high river a few days later his statements were confirmed as there was
 only one cabin in the sixtyfive miles of road travelled on my arrival at high river i found only three
 cabins while the fourth was being built by the n w cattle co who had just brought in 3 000
 head of cattle from idaho 0 h smith and lafayette french in partnership and jasper smith better known as buck
 5 were the first settlers to locate on high river they erected their cabins about a mile west of the
 present town in 1878 tom lynch and george emerson had a cabin about six miles up the river near the
 medicine tree where the n w cattle co also built 0 h smith s son frank who was then two
 years old was the first child born to a settler on high river french and smith kept a road house
 and looked after the mail which was kept in a soap box and was usually found under a bunk mail
 came west about once a month during good weather and any old time when winter set in the nearest official
 p o was fort benton south of the boundary line around the little rockies where most of them were killed
 in the winter of ‘ 81 and ‘ 82 in 1881 all the cree indians of big bear s band
 crossed the line for the last big hunt riel with his following of half breeds was there also besides many
 white hunters especially those from the yellowstone who were so successful the winter before i wintered there our oxen were
 turned out for the winter at the little rockies and it was a common occurrence to go out in the
 morning and find them among the buffalo that was the last big buffalo hunt i came up to canada late
 in the summer of ‘ 82 driving eight yoke of oxen and drawing three wagons loaded with 1 800 pounds
 of flour for fort calgary we loaded four ton in the lead three in mont about 300 miles south every
 letter mailed here had to have a u s stamp attached the mail was carried by i g baker co
 who had some arrangement with the government once a very hot argument took place at french smith s over mail
 matters some eastern canadians who had worked on a government survey party west from the end of the c p
 r then under construction arrived at high river they took advantage of being once more near a post office by
 writing several letters and of course stamped them with canadian stamps which they brought from the east when jim scott
 the stage driver arrived they handed the swing and two in the trail wagon we however unloaded at fort macleod
 and the outfit was sold to i g baker co while in maclead i met an old acquaintance who had
 been an old trader he informed me that the country had altered very little since the old days a few
 cabins had been built near the barracks or on some of the rivers and creeks close by otherwise conditions were
 little changed him the letters when he told them that they must put u s stamps on the letters they
 became very indignant jim who was a great josher told them they must be an ignorant lot not to know
 that they had crossed the line they became furious the climax was reached when he told them that he was
 a good american and would not carry letters not even for queen victoria herself unless jasper smith was born in
 alabama in 1839 and went with his father to the california gold rush in 1849 he then drifted north served
 as a scout for the u s army and made his first trading venture into canada in 1863 he issued
 rations at treaty seven in 1877 and settled at high river in the winter of 1878 79 this early photograph

 western canada never had a wild high river until a few years ago was west as that term was understood
 chiefly a ranching country after the across the line we had our quota of c e railway was built in
 1892 there would be bad men here but their notions were more cattle shipped from this diswere never realized except
 in the bar trict at caley stockyards than any other room the real western man never was point in alberta
 no other place in bad on the contrary he was as a rule alberta was better known to stockmen an
 amiable quiet law abiding citizen than high river some very notable who minded his own business and looked men have
 worked on its roundups it to others to do the same can lay claim to some of the best riders
 the term bad man as used in the and ropers in canada as a real cow west did not mean
 that a man was country it stood second to none in the naturally mean a man was considered dominion on

 intimidate others usually and had worked on all the different weaker than himself they were as a cattle ranges from

 if all their deeds of benevolence charity ing on the other side of the line and of and kindness to
 their fellows were re having killed their man in self defence corded it would a thousand times offset but they
 never looked for trouble here their weakness at times for the cup no doubt the fear of the canadian law

 numerous in the days of the death he has been known to kill his buffalo they feasted off the flesh
 of opponent if a bear had you down or these animals when they had the oppor you threw yourself on
 the ground and tunity the grizzly being known to pull remained perfectly still the chances down a cow on many
 occasions and a were that after a bite or two he would fight between a grizzly and a bull buf
 leave you he would always try for falo was not a rare sight the bear often the head and face
 although a heavy coming out second best clumsy looking animal it took a good horse to get away from him
 a horse was all three varieties of the bear family desperately afraid of the sight or smell would often be
 seen together and i have of bear although i know of one instance myself seen as many as ten in
 a band and one only in which a horse stood near the blackfoot crossing in the bow up to and
 fought off a grizzly the story river in 1876 their principal food was is worth telling the roots they dug
 and the berries to be obtained from the bushes along the river i was in the state of montana when
 valleys more particularly the berry this incident occurred in the year 1902 known as the sarvis berry or saskatoon and
 was not far from the scene of the which grew in great profusion in alberta encounter which was in the
 foothills they would not disdain meat when they near two medicine lake i knew the could procure it i have
 also seen bands man felix munroe a piegan half breed of as many as twenty black brown and well and
 had his account of the grizzly together in the country on the encounter after his recovery he was north side
 of the peace river not far riding an old mare that he had owned below where the findlay and parsnip
 for years a small clumsy beast of the rivers join and form the peace the mustang breed and was on
 his way into country in places looked as though a the foothills after the carcass of a deer drove of
 hogs had rooted through it he had recently killed on nearing the this was as late as 1905 the black
 spot where he had hung the meat he and brown bear were good tree climbers came upon a young half
 grown grizzly but the grizzly was unable to climb his dismounting and leaving his horse he claws although long were
 blunt while fired and killed it he also wounded a the claws of the other two species were second young
 grizzly that appeared after sharp pointed firing his shot he was thereupon suddenly attacked by the old she who had
 it was seldom that the plains been eating the deer having pulled it indians killed these animals for down from
 the tree where it hung munalthough many of the chiefs wore roe managed to fire a shot into her when
 heavy collars of bear claws these she dashed the gun from his hand and were obtained in trade from other
 with another savage blow knocked him tribes down and commenced to claw and tear the grizzly was a wicked beast
 to at his body stripping the clothes off encounter although he would seldom him and mauling him most severely be
 the first to attack you could by no the mare had stood by through all means trust him for he
 would turn on this and she now most wonderful to a man on very slight provocation and relate savagely attacked
 the bear a full unless killed at the first shot was very grown grizzly she bit and struck with liable
 to kill his opponent it took a her fore feet whirling round at intervals to lash out with both hind
 feet the so while hibernating their cubs are bear savagely fought back she tore the born while in their winter
 den and are saddle into ribbons and cut and slashed strong and lively when they come out the mare in
 a ghastly manner strips in the spring the old she bear is of flesh were hanging from her shoulders generally
 in fair condition and at that when the fight was over the mare by time looks for meat devouring any
 carher savage fighting got the bear away non she comes across the cubs are from the man who though half
 uncon generally two in number and are easily scious managed to crawl away a few tamed when young but become
 dangeryards into the brush he watched the ous as they grow older the grizzly whole fight but was unable to
 render sometimes called the silver tip attains any assistance he thought the fight a large size often weighing 1 000
 lbs lasted at least half an hour the mare it has sometimes been said that this is going a short
 distance and the bear fol not the true grizzly bear met with in lowing when she would again attack california
 this i think is an error i and unbelievable as it may seem the have seen both and find no
 difference old she grizzly finally had enough and they weigh often as heavy and the only retreated into the woods
 leaving the difference is that the northern grizzly mare although victorious in a pitiable has a heavier coat than his
 southern condition relation caused no doubt by a colder climate munroe after agonizing effort finally managed to throw himself face
 down the wolf across the mare s back she carried him in the days of the buffalo the large in
 this manner for several miles and at last on arriving at his camp the man grey wolf ran in packs
 and numbers of them were always to be found prowling was still on her back although uncon around and among
 the buffalo herds scious on being relieved of her burden they had food in plenty depending the mare lay down
 and it was days almost altogether on the buffalo they before she recovered sufficiently to stand would pull down many
 calves and on her feet but with care recover she wounded animals were always their did she was never used
 again but was meat a class of hunter from the south turned out to pasture for the rest of her
 named the wolfer made a business life of hunting them as the skins would in munroe eventually was able to
 move the early seventies always bring two about but lost the sight of one eye and or even three dollars
 in fort benton never completely recovered he died their mode of killing was much easier two years later internal injuries
 causing than hunting the buffalo and during a his death with two of munroe s rela winter they would obtain
 more skins tions i visited the place where this fight with less trouble than running down and took place we
 found his rifle the stock skinning and tanning the hides obtained broken the dead bear was also found from the
 buffalo and the marks of the conflict between their mode of procedure was as folthe bear and the horse could
 not be mis lows a number of buffalo would be taken this is the solitary instance i ever killed at
 intervals of a mile or so apart heard of in which a horse without urg the carcass cut in half
 and laid on its ing and to protect his master engaged side strychnine was then mixed with in such a
 combat and i doubt if it has the entrails and well stirred the poison ever been duplicated would permeate all
 parts of the meat black and brown bear are as a this was left in that position all winter the
 wolfers would pitch their camp or general rule glad to avoid man though should they have their cubs with them
 are savage and will attack on sight the meat of a young black bear is in november they go in
 fat and remain much like pork but that of the grizzly is rank and unfit for food bear den up
 for the winter generally build a cabin on some nearby river bot wolves are very savage and cases are tom
 and at intervals through the winter heard of where an indian or white man would visit their different baits often
 has been pulled down and devoured by twenty or thirty and drag the poisoned them they depend to a great
 extent and hard frozen wolf carcasses to camp on the rabbit for their food and when i have seen hundreds
 of these carcasses at intervals of several years the rabbits piled up near their camp waiting until die out these
 wolves become the most the spring to thaw them out when they dangerous the cottontail rabbit affords would be skinned
 often other animals food for numerous beasts of prey the were found poisoned such as badger or wolf and lynx

 to be in the vicinity there few years are found in incredible numwas an indian dog or two if this
 should bers when they reach this stage they happen trouble would most surely are attacked by a contagious disease ensue
 and the wolfers would be lucky which kills them off almost completely if they got off by paying in provisions
 over a large range of territory when many times the value of the canines the this occurs the wolf has
 to go hungry indian valued his dog next to his horse and turn his attention to any living thing for
 although they were a vicious howl good for food he comes across wolves ing nuisance they were useful to the
 will then combine in packs and drive out indian and hauled on their travois either the moose and every other
 animal in a loads of meat from buffalo killed on their large district hunts or children tents and many heavy
 when the rabbits disappear the times loads when they moved their camps are hard for the indian and the trapper
 which they were continually doing it the northern indians subsist largely on was the business of the squaw solely to
 the rabbits and when they disappear look after and handle these dogs they they suffer accordingly the fur bearing were
 not gentle with them by any means animals such as the lynx the fox and but would beat them unmercifully
 on all others are also preyed on by the timber occasions the wolfer therefore tried wolf and driven out or
 killed off in to set out his baits as far as possible consequence the catch of fur is short and
 from an indian camp there is little fur to trade few of the the large grey prairie wolf has now
 northern indians such as the beaver nearly disappeared during the days will kill a wolf being strongly superwhen the cattle
 industry flourished and stitious regarding them saying they are range cattle grazed where the buffalo possessed of a wetago or
 devil the once roamed the grey wolf turned his timber wolf therefore is little molested attention to the ranchers cattle
 and com the result being that they are increasing mitted great depredations slaughtering and are not only dangerous to the
 soliinnumerable calves and in many cases tary traveller or indian in the north but grown animals they were hunted with
 are destroying much wolf game packs of hounds brought from the east i have no particular love for the and
 even from the old country for the purpose they were also poisoned and wolf myself having had several the cubs
 dug out of their dens and every unpleasant experiences with them i met the timber wolves on one occaother means
 possible tried to exterminate sion in the year 1906 the rabbits them bounties were given by the stock had that
 year died off and in conassociations and the government and this went on for many years until you sequence the
 timber wolves were might say they were exterminated on the hungry and hunting any game in plains a few are
 now to be found and sight or scent they have become so wary as to be very i had the

 country north of the saskatche point they had arrived that year at the wan and in the mountains it is
 almost end of july i had charge of the pack train black in colour being if anything larger of some
 sixty pack horses there were than his cousin the prairie wolf timber thirty men with an officer in the party
 they intended to winter at fort graham river on two occasions i saw packs of and as the packing was
 all over for four or five wolves chasing a moose the season i was anxious to return to across the
 moose swimming for his life edmonton as there was no other way on the second occasion although i of getting
 out i decided to buy a canoe paddled hard to avoid them i nearly and go down the findlay and
 peace collided with a moose and one of the river to peace river crossing and from wolves swimming some distance
 behind there on overland and across the lesser his fellows endeavored to climb into the slave lake to athabasca landing
 the canoe over the side logs on which he journey by water down the findlay to lodged his forefeet and
 i had to club its junction with the parsnip where him with the paddle they together form the peace was
 some 120 miles and from there on to peace river crossing about 250 miles more the coyote the miserable cousin
 of i purchased a thirty foot dugout canoe the wolf has few of the latter s from mr fox in

 at that time of the year for brush country but have been pretty well one not acquainted with the river
 it cleaned out on the plains they are being the first of september i started very swift and it takes
 a fast hound to down alone on the long river journey drag one down in the early days when i
 had no trouble going down the findlay they were much more numerous they to the mouth of the parsnip where
 i had the unpleasant habit of occasionally met a camp of beaver indians who going mad and a mad coyote
 was a helped me down the findlay rapids terror at such times they had no fear which were bad they
 warned me about of man or beast but would run through some bad rapids about 100 miles down an indian
 camp foaming at the mouth so i kept a careful lookout for several and snapping at all within reach days
 but on the fourth day after leav t ing the indian camp having somewhat relaxed my vigilance i unfortunately the
 mountain lion occasionally came struck what was called the parlez pas down from the mountains to feast on buf rapids

 often seen their eagle traps whitefish has depleted the lakes menin operation there was one on the hill tioned to
 a considerable extent and if overlooking old fort calgary which long continued will eventually be of seemed a favourite place

 nothing about the ultimate dug a deep hole and covered this with extinction of the fish brush again laying sod
 over it all a we thought in the early days that small hole being left in the centre on the

 protected from their natural he would reach up and seize the bird by enemies the legs and draw him down

 in the south and near the the eagle required an enormous amount american boundary more particularly of patience but was
 well rewarded when along the belly river rattlesnakes used an eagle was captured to be very numerous although of late
 years they are rare i have never seen fish or heard of rattlesnakes north of the bow river but on
 the belly river near fort every river from the american bound whoop up in rocky ravines along that ary line
 to the arctic teemed with fish river i have seen what the indians of many varieties on the advent of
 the called rattlesnake dens there i saw mounted police in 1874 the lakes also hundreds of snakes forming a solid

 of these rattlers would be heard for they are now only plentiful back from a long distance they would gather

 and the sight was a gruesome one the and the wise fishing laws now enacted indians killed many using their

 time to come rattles also being used as ornaments the rattlesnake had the habit of other snakes there were but

 west 1858 c a loveland of wisconsin has been here for the past two months prospecting 1896 his last visit
 to edmonton was in march 1858 when the only building here was the h b fort which was enclosed by
 a stockade extending down on the flat and enclosing the chief factor s house he came in from fort garry
 winnipeg via forts carleton and pitt reaching here in march he was here about six weeks when the party went
 through the jasper pass to the head waters of the fraser river they knew nothing of saskatchewan gold in those
 days but were anxious to get to the fraser placer mines mr loveland remembers that there was no money in
 circulation at fort edmonton in 1858 and though he had plenty of american gold he could not purchase an ounce
 of anything with it he had to work for a shilling a day and his board in the building of
 a roman catholic mission church inside the stockade and he traded his earnings out at the fort for supplies to
 take him through the mountains while he was here a band of about 3 000 blackfeet indians arrived from the
 south to trade at the fort the first morning after their arrival a chief came down in full dress accompanied
 by 50 or 100 of his followers bringing a present for the h b co s chief factor when the
 present had been made the cannons of the fort fired a salute which was answered by the indians firing their
 guns then the chief retired and another came and the ceremony was repeated until all had greeted the factor then
 six of the indians were told off to take care of the arms of all the others and trading commenced
 dried buffalo meat in varying quantities was brought in and traded and the indians got considerable rum and had a
 carousal the six guardians were compelled to keep sober at nightfall the indians came and fired at the fort but
 were not answered and did no damage when the trading was ended the six sober indians were taken into the
 fort and treated to drink and the best of what was going the party remained about three or four days
 and then returned south his description of trading at fort garry was amusing the rule there was to hand down
 the first article of any kind asked for thus a 200 pound man would probably be handed a pair of
 pants of a size suitable for a 120 pound man and they were expected to take them and vice versa
 they objected to any selection being made mr loveland himself had great difficulty in getting supplies there at all he
 was there ten days before he could get attended to after he had waited several days he remained at closing
 time and by his persistence got the clerk to serve him after hours he wanted a pound of tea and
 was told to put out his handkerchief they knew nothing about wrapping goods in paper and when he had persuaded
 the clerk to find him a piece of coarse paper and he asked for twine he was handed a piece
 of half inch rope to tie up the parcel containing the pound of tea when he asked for a two
 quart kettle the nearest one was handed him which would hold some two gallons and it was only by more
 persuasion that he could induce the clerk to let him have the size he wanted from a little further along
