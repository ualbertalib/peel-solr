 shooting first battalion has won the hamilton gault trophy the 1960 score of 141 31 was an improvement 0:improve 0:ment 
 of nearly nine points over last years score when they placed second in the trophy competition with a score of 
 131 969 the winner of the 1959 competition was ir22er with a score of 132 963 this small margin of 
 loss helped serve as an incentive to all members 0:mem 0:bers of the battalion to put just that much more 
 into their efforts this year this positive attitude united with a favourable training programme and reasonably good weather gave the 
 battalion the basic requirements for good shooting a musketry cadre was formed consisting of bravo company commanded by major wmw 
 wilson cd and assisted by the battalion rifle team all the firing took place at heales range csm wo2 green 
 ac and sgt zwolak ea gave valuable tips on the methods of good shooting to the various relays after a 
 month the results of individual determination and careful training became evident when men that had failed to qualify the year 
 before now became first class shots and a number of first class shots became marksman the battalion had set its 
 sights on 140 points and within a short period of time this and better was achieved first battalion may well 
 be proud of their fine achievement having placed second two years in a row first battalion is particularly aware that

 very early in the year when the commanding officer and the musketry officer decided that 1 ppcli would win the 
 canadian army championship major wg milne the musketry officer was named team captain and responsible for the formation and training 
 of the team major milne s tremendous drive and energy combined with his considerable shooting experience contributed immeasurably to the 
 standard which the team reached in the limited time available on the 14th of mar 60 approximately 40 members of 
 the unit reported to heales range for the eliminations which would ultimately produce 10 members who would comprise the team 
 from the very first day of the eliminations competition was very keen this competitive spirit was to strike the keynote 
 for all rifle team activity from that day forward by mid may eliminations were completed and the following members had

 the bc area eliminations at blair range after the first day of competition i ppcli led rcsme by a scant 
 8 points the following day the margin gradually widened until finally 1 ppcli led the runner up team from rcsme 
 by 156 points the three other team competitions the roberts the falling plates and the obstacle course matches were also 
 won by 1 ppcli in very keen competition 0:competi 0:tion the sportsmanship of all teams and individuals was of the

 phase of the army rifle competition and having also gained in confidence and experience the second phase the western command 
 eliminations began on the ist of jun when the team arrived in camp sarcee prepared to compete against the winning 
 teams from each of alberta saskatchewan and manitoba areas very early in the meet it became clear that 2 ppcli 
 team alberta area representatives would prove to be our principal opponents the open and friendly rivalry between the teams of 
 our first and second battalions in no way affected the seriousness with which both teams attended to their shooting 0:shoot

 the next day both teams shot equally well until the final match in which first battalion increased their lead to

 of the team dominated the service conditions shooting almost completely by winning three team matches and five individual matches wo2 
 green and pte pearson also gained berths on the provincial team which was to represent bc at the dcra matches 
 in ottawa needless to say they declined in deference to the right they had already earned to represent western command 
 returning to victoria on the 11th of june the team joined in the units last minute preparations to move to 
 wainwright for the 1 cibg concentration on the 13th of june all members of the team and the battalion were 
 profoundly shocked and saddened to learn of the sudden death of major wg milne each member of the team felt 
 a great personal loss however the indomitable spirit with which the team captain had imbued the team remained his guiding 
 influence remained with the team through subsequent competitions 
 the patrician 9 after a short period of routine soldiering in wainwright the team entered the brigade small arms competition 
 and in the rifle division emerged victorious over all other units in the brigade at this point the team lost

 to maintain a small lead throughout true to previous form the team forged ahead of their nearest opponents during the

 the patrician 13 an unforgetable soldier lt col hw niven dso mc ret james m christie joined the patricias in 
 aug 14 as a private soldier and was commissioned in aug 17 during his service with the regiment he was 
 awarded a distinguished conduct medal a military cross and was mentioned in despatches james christie came from the yukon where 
 for years he had been a bear hunter he usually lived and hunted alone and in one encounter with a 
 grizzly bear had his jaw and the left side of his head badly torn which caused a nasty scar after 
 finishing off the bear with his knife he had to travel five days to reach civilization where his injuries could 
 be attended to he was thin about five foot seven inches tall and though he was over 40 years of 
 age when he joined the regiment could outwalk anyone we had his long life alone in the mountains made him 
 the most observant man i have ever known he saw everything and said nothing he could put his hand on 
 the ground in no man s land and tell you a man had passed by there one hour ago two 
 hours ago three hours ago it was uncanny he was never wrong i have never known anyone who had such 
 patience or power of concentration as christie no white man that i know of could concentrate for more than possibly 
 three hours on one spot christie could do it for two days he would lie out in the open behind 
 our trenches day in and day out with the sights of his rifle on some part of the enemy trench 
 waiting for a head to come up if it didn t appear today it would be there tomorrow and sure 
 enough one of the enemy would come to that spot and christie would get him at hooge he climbed on 
 top of a barn got behind a chimney and shot several german officers the enemy knowing where the shots came 
 from concentrated a battery of artillery on the barn and scored some direct hits i found christie that afternoon lying 
 behind our hq suffering with a very bad headache i told him to go to the dressing station which was 
 located about three miles in rear of our area he was examined by a medical officer who accused him of 
 malingering and put him to work carrying stretcher cases the following day he returned and a couple of days later 
 the divisional surgeon visited us i asked him if he would take christie to poperinge for an x ray which 
 disclosed two skull fractures he served with us for two years after this incident but would never go sick again 
 for fear the medical authorities would find these cracks we had an officer missing and for ten days a concerted 
 effort by the cef was made trying to locate him he had left the trenches with his company and had 
 disappeared christie came to me and said he thought he could find him i gave him the necessary permission and 
 he left with three days rations four days later christie came back with the missing officer who was in a 
 terrible state he found him in the ypres salient 70 miles away and marched him back to the regiment christie 
 liked to wander about in no man s land at night one morning 0:morn 0:ing he came back saying he 
 thought a german patrol went past our front 
 the patrician 14 about 0200 hours he wanted four men to go out with him the next night to ambush 
 the patrol i rode into hq and spoke to general sir george milne afterwards cigs and sir george uncle george 
 to patricias said he would come along about midnight about 0200 hours a terrific row started away to our left 
 front we could not fire and the germans could not fire as we both had patrols out about 0330 hours 
 christie and his men came in and uncle george questioned them christie and his men each armed with four grenades 
 and a rifle ambushed the patrol which consisted of one officer and 16 men right on the route that christie 
 thought they had followed 0:fol 0:lowed the previous night he shot the officer first each of his men threw two 
 grenades and then finished the job with rifles christie removed their shoulder straps for identification removed all papers etc and 
 dropped everything in a sandbag on his return he found that his patrol had taken the germans rifles and two 
 of his men had left their own behind he asked sir george for permission to go out and get the 
 rifles as he was responsible the general s face was a study but he gave his permission he awarded christie 
 an immediate dcm and presented it personally two days later two previous recommendations for a dcm had been turned down 
 by general milne as he did not consider anyone could do the things we had attributed to christie one year 
 hammie gault sent christie a large photo of himself for a christmas present christie came to victoria to see me 
 and borrowed a tunic of mine put on his own medals and had his photograph taken he told the photographer 
 to enlarge the picture one size larger than the one he had received from hammie i thought hammie would die

 the patrician 16 first battalion report training work point barracks and vancouver island 1960 was an interesting and rather hectic 
 year first battalion is proud of major achievements in musketry and boxing and a continued high standard of ceremonial and 
 training with the single exception of the leave month everyone was busy and each month offered a variety in tasks 
 jan began with two weeks of national survival refresher training from the soldier s point of view the highlight was 
 probably being prepared for rescue and then being dropped down two storeys outside the barrack block this was followed by 
 a full scale exercise tyro 2 which saw the battalion assemble and move to nanaimo and a skeleton force continue 
 over to vancouver as a mobile survival column during feb a large number of unit courses were completed and in 
 mar d company carried out a series of patrols incorporating the assistance of an rcn helicopter five patrols were formed 
 with the strength of five men each the patrols were commanded by lts bolding and dallison and corporals glasspoole meyers 
 and shaw the helicopter used was the h 15 the main function of this craft is search and rescue and 
 it has been specifically designed for that function the reconnaissance patrols were dropped on two consecutive days three the first 
 day two the second each patrol was landed on a different landing zone to the west of mount benson each 
 was faced with the same problem mount benson towered 3500 feet between them and their objective needless to say there 
 was a stiff climb involved every company carried out section and platoon training during april and may using albert head 
 mary hill nanaimo and courtenay highway movement is done so often that the drills become automatic night and cross country 
 driving practice is much more difficult to achieve and is principally conducted during the wainwright concentration wainwright concentration because of 
 the presentation of colours ceremonies in 1959 first battalion missed the annual concentration for 1960 it was again the culmination 
 of the years training a new experience for many but a repeat for most officers and ncos major kerfoot commanded 
 the road convoys both ways passing through the usa and meeting the battalion train party at calgary from there we 
 formed the mobile survival column for an exercise into camp wainwright the battalion had almost a month in bivouac at 
 border lake as always there was a requirement to renew the drills and techniques so necessary to good field operations 
 in addition we married up with the ldsh 1 rcha 3 fd sqn and with them partici 
 the patrician 17 pa ted as a battalion group in the brigade and goc s exercises on the 15th of 
 jul second battalion officers were hosts at a very pleasant regimental 0:regi 0:mental get together when formal presentations were made 
 to captain mike carleton smith who was leaving to return to the united kingdom the entire period was a busy 
 one and the concentration certainly achieved the standards required c company was detached to act as enemy force for ex 
 thunderbird the exercise in which the goc exercised the brigade group major sutherland had them almost speaking fantasian and qmsi 
 appleton in one coup captured more prisoners than any other unit or sub unit the battalion returned to work point 
 on the ist of aug and by the 10th most of the battalion had cleared the peace time accounting requirements 
 and were off on a welcome period of leave seps highlight was the annual inspection by the goc commander 1 
 cibg and commander bc area a formal parade was held on the 22nd of sep followed by a mess dinner 
 held at the officers mess our distinguished 0:dis 0:tinguished guests had a worthwhile visit and the results on all phases 
 were up to patricia standards the battalion then commenced individual training again with cadres being established for musketry leading infantryman 
 qualifications and separate courses on signals driving and each of the support weapons once again weapon training received priority and 
 there were the usual large number of individuals off to career army courses at various schools a great deal of 
 training is accomplished using the cadres but it is worth noting that individuals remain in parent companies for all administration 
 this permits continuity and retains the essential company spirit the battalion paused briefly for the xmas and new years season 
 however 1961 started off with the continuation of national survival training and additional specialist courses lasting into mar 61 the 
 nitinat search an unusual operation occurred in the first half of jun of 1960 when the first battalion answered a 
 request for organized ground search assistance from the rcaf search and rescue at sea island b c earlier in the 
 month a seebee amphibious aircraft had crashed in the vicinity of nitinat lake on the western slopes of vancouver island 
 when this aircraft was discovered it contained the body of the pilot his passenger however was not in the wreckage 
 and it was assumed that he had left the scene of the wreck on foot the rcaf search and rescue 
 element had been placed in command but when the search became a ground one they called on first battalion after 
 authorization was received from area headquarters the commanding officer implemented the survival operations fan out system and alerted the battalion 
 by 0530 hours four and one half hours after receiving the authorization 262 troops organized into a mobile self contained 
 detachment arrived at lake cowichan 60 miles north and west of victoria a base camp was established approximately 10 miles 
 from the scene of the crash and air reconnaissance of the search area was conducted the 
 the patrician 18 1 ppcli search parties crossing nitinat lake area to be searched was the north side of nitinat 
 lake this lake lies at the bottom of a valley in the mountainous country on vancouver island s west coast 
 the forest in this area is extremely dense and is considered by persons with experience to be among the roughest 
 of the west coast rain forests the speed of travel is restricted to one mile an hour that of a 
 searcher about 2 500 feet per hour the slopes are steep the water courses correspondingly so and the terrain is 
 littered with deadfall that makes movement quite difficult as if the terrain was not enough to hamper the search an 
 element of mystery also found its way into the affair approximately 1 000 feet from the wreckage a camera belonging 
 to the missing man had been discovered plus the tongue of a shoe similar to that worn by sportsmen these 
 clues plus the fact that the survival gear was missing from the wreck led search officials to believe that the 
 survivor was attempting to reach help and was following any one of three water courses to civilization the search parties 
 of 1 ppcli spread out accordingly but nothing of value was discovered for three days as the clues were eliminated 
 the searchers were reduced the battalion s detachment had all but left the area when they were recalled to make 
 an intensive search of the camera area a small party returned to this area and painstakingly went over the ground 
 their diligence was rewarded by the finding of the missing partner the next day his body was lifted out and 
 the operation was over the nitinat search pointed up a number of weaknesses in the current equipment of the infantry 
 soldier for this type of operation searchers 
 the patrician 19 found that pack sacks or pack boards capable of carrying up to 50 pounds were a necessity 
 as it was rations and bedrolls had to be air dropped to the searchers clearings have to be cut for 
 such air drops and this is time consuming the problem of communications was tackled immediately on arrival at the base 
 camp relay stations were established using prnc 510 sets prnc 26 sets were used within search parties to report positions 
 and maintain control the rcaf supplied a pack set for ground to air communications high ground was used to advantage 
 and in general communications were good considering the nature of the terrain the search was a new and challenging experience 
 because of the type of terrain over which it was conducted the rain forest is a new experience for most 
 canadians foot soldier mobility remains the only means by which a successful search can be completed special events regimental birthday 
 1960 the regimental birthday was celebrated this year by first battalion in characteristic style the day commenced with a battalion 
 parade brigadier wg colquhoun cbe mc an original officer and also a former commanding officer inspected the battalion brigadier colquhoun

 malice the sergeants two platoon system proved the difference between the

 canada force much time was devoted to learning to fight and survive on both the conventional and nuclear battlefields new 
 recruits were absorbed and integrated into the battalion while the older soldiers were qualified on a number of different courses

 of jun and moved to an assembly area just north of ranfurly alberta the battalion remained in this location until 
 early on the morning of the 20th of jun when orders were received to proceed by a specified route to 
 camp wainwright which had theoretically undergone a nuclear attack on arrival in wainwright and at the completion of the survival 
 exercise the battalion moved into its bivouac area in the north west portion of camp wainwright on the high ground 
 overlooking the battle river the remainder of the concentration was carried out in three phases phase 1 which lasted ten 
 days consisted of sub unit training under battalion arrangements phase 2 saw the battalion marry up with its supporting arms 
 and carry out a week of intensive training with them phase 3 encompassed three weeks of formation training mainly battalion 
 and brigade group exercises 
 the patrician 30 the emphasis on training during 1960 was once again on the nuclear battle and particularly on defence 
 of the main zone during phase 1 three battalion controlled exercises were run to practice patrolling by day and night 
 obstacle crossing by night and daylight tactical operations these exercises plus the training conducted by companies got the concentration off 
 to a vigorous start during phase 2 the battalion participated in four exercises commencing 0:com 0:mencing with exercise bunkers hill 
 a company group exercise stressing 0:stress 0:ing infantry tank co operation the remaining three exercises dealt with day and night 
 tactical movement of the battalion group night occupation and withdrawal from the main zone and the hasty occupation of the 
 main zone to take up a blocking position at the completion of phase 2 even the newest recruits in the 
 battalion had seen almost every corner of camp wainwright if only from the top of a tank plunging over the 
 sand hills at night two exercises field goal and ground power were conducted by 1 cibg during phase 3 on 
 one of these exercises the entire brigade group minus recce parties left the camp boundaries and journeyed for approximately ten 
 hours over dusty saskatchewan and alberta country roads during phase 3 enemy air activity was a constant menace restricting practically 
 all movement to the hours of darkness these aircraft were also capable of aerial delivery of war gases as the 
 battalion soon found out and the necessity for good gas alarms and drills was a lesson brought home radio jamming 
 and monitoring also lent a realistic aspect to these exercises despatch riders were called on to work many extra hours 
 as a result of enemy interference with the radio nets the final exercise thunderbird which was controlled by the goc 
 saw second battalion in reserve a good deal of the time with the wide areas of responsibility on the nuclear 
 battlefield being in reserve did not reduce in the slightest the requirement for alertness and all round defence the battalion 
 also had to be ready to move rapidly to any threatened area as a counter attack force at the completion 
 of exercise thunderbird on the morning of the 28th of jul it could truly be said that the battalion accomplished 
 a great deal during the 1960 concentration and had succeeded in attaining the goal of being a unit fit to

 not be carried out as in previous years rifle and automatic rifle classification was fired at winterburn ranges on the 
 28th of nov 60 scores were down slightly by comparison with previous classifications this is attributed to the weather as

 life then a musician s military career is as flavoured a repast as one could desire engagements of a service 
 band call for a versatility in rendition ranging from roll out the barrel to onward christian soldiers from the general 
 salute to the fifth symphony the past twelve months were no exceptions to this observation an active beginning was made 
 by the band s appearance at the army show a stage presentation at the jubilee auditorium that climaxed a week 
 of consistent thorough rehearsals revising the old motto there s no business like show business if you don t mind 
 hard work a hurried move to wainwright where the junior ncos school claimed our attention for a passing out parade 
 this ceremony accompanied throughout by a steady downpour of rain was without a doubt one of the wettest in our 
 experience in full dress we stood in bedraggled spendour stoically awaiting the final march off it was with wholehearted relief 
 when we finally withdrew in waterlogged dignity trooping the colour our first with the 2nd battalion since 1957 was performed 
 with the excellence one has come to expect from the patricias on these occasions despite the high winds and unseasonable 
 cold that forced many of the spectators to huddle into their topcoats the ensuing social functions were great opportunities for 
 meeting old friends that never fail to appear at these events the glorious month of jun found us fulfilling duties 
 at whitehorse in the yukon that wonderful station of hunting fishing and mess functions 0:func 0:tions not exactly a holiday 
 but just as expensive the unceasing daylight 
 the patrician 48 at this time of the year is hardly conducive to a good night s sleep but one 
 soon adjusts to this northern phenomenon on return to edmonton the new band studio at calder was ready for occupation 
 this our fourth band building to be used within the last four years is our final one we hope for 
 some time the official opening of the peace river bridge heralded an extremely busy day for us a guard of 
 honour at the airport for the minister of defence was merely the prelude to numerous duties carried out that day 
 concluding with a parade through the city of dawson creek a fitting finale that ended the day long activities celebrating 
 the gala occasion our annual inspection by the chief inspector of bands took place in nov marching band choir dance 
 band and various small ensembles are reviewed at such times as these the previous long weeks of application to musical 
 detail were well rewarded with a highly satisfactory report three candidates band sergeants bayens van gijn and bergman are congratulated 
 on achieving their well merited group iv status the onset of the cold season brought with it a reminder of 
 the importance of winter indoctrination muffled up in the appropriate arctic clothing lectures and practice in arctic survival were the 
 order of the day quite astonishing the way identities dissolve into duffle socks parkas and baggy pants this squad didn 
 t look like the band at all trudging across the snow rather like a group heading for a santa claus 
 convention some good lessons were learned but frankly the art of galloping 0:gallop 0:ing in snowshoes still eludes us with 
 rhythmical creaks and intermittent gasps the 5 bx physical training programme embarked upon last summer continues to nourish our ageing 
 bodies the transformation from bloated intellectuals into agile huskies is not yet apparent but our protesting joints suggest that the 
 conversion won t be long delayed darts table tennis and bridge maintain a lively rivalry within the band avoiding the 
 idleness of spare moments during breaks for coffee a hearty welcome to our newcomers sergeants ryan and de vlieger and

 one of the best post war years for the loyal edmonton regiment despite the fact that we have been advised 
 from australia that our allied regiment the 47th infantry battalion the wide bay regiment has been absorbed into one of 
 the regular army units namely the ist battalion royal queensland regiment the passing of this regiment we note with regret 
 it is true to say that the strength of the regiment has not been better since the end of the 
 war it is also true that the level of co operation 0:co 0:opera 0:tion we are obtaining from the instructional 
 cadre alberta area and from the ppcli home station has never been more fulsome or more practical winter training was 
 predicated on teaching recruits the necessary military skills and teaching the trained soldiers the national survival drills and skills this 
 culminated in exercise shake down in may and again this year we were blessed with some frightfully inclement weather for 
 almost the entire exercise the representation at the exercise however was first class troops came in from the carrier platoon 
 at dawson creek bc d company at grande prairie and a company at vegreville and vermilion we learned many lessons 
 from the exercise and these lessons are being taught in our training this fall during the summer major ed boyd 
 our 2ic conducted a young soldier training course of six weeks duration four weeks was spent at the prince of 
 wales armouries edmonton and two weeks in the field at wainwright here they were joined by a similar unit from 
 calgary the training at wainwright consisted of applying the knowledge already acquired during the four weeks extensive training at edmonton 
 and involved two overnight exercises prior to going down to wainwright these 160 lads put on a ceremonial 0:cere 0:monial 
 parade at the prince of wales armouries and it was apparent 
 the patrician 60 maj gen g walsh cbe dso cd inspecting the young soldiers on their return from camp wainwright 
 aug 60 that not only is this young soldier training plan giving the young men a useful summer occupation but 
 it was a re vitalizing factor for the militia it is understood the other provinces are copying this scheme which 
 as we have reported before was put into operation by brigadier ra bradburn when he was commanding the loyal edmonton 
 regiment the summer training covered three specific groups namely junior nco wing driver and maintenance wing and wireless wing all 
 of these were preceded by one full week of basic military training also included in the training curriculum was civil 
 defence training at the civil defence school in the edmonton river valley a surprising number of lads qualified for both

 wireless transport driving regimental police and cooks training all this training is pointed towards self sufficiency in national survival training

 is considered most likely that these would be the roles upon which they would be called upon to play d

 the patrician 67 3rd green jackets the rifle rrigade we have had another full and varied year once again for 
 much of the time the battalion has been spread to the four winds over the length and breadth of europe 
 it is impossible to go into the mess at any time of the year without finding that someone is either 
 just off or just back from somewhere interesting this constantly changing scene is responsible for a stimulating atmosphere in the 
 battalion as continental travel and other erstwhile u pursuits are no longer confined to officers and sergeants again the year 
 s highlight was the prix le clerc held at harskamp near arnhem in holland there is no denying that the 
 le clerc is vastly more difficult to win these days than it was when we won it at celle nine 
 years ago all the nato armies and the americans in particular have raised their standards tremendously the americans begin practice 
 in feb and great interest and publicity attaches to the many eliminating rounds of their competition to select their le 
 clerc team scores are published on apu and in stars and stripes and unlike us they have no other meetings 
 such as bisley and the baor competitions to distract them add to this american thoroughness and professionalism and you find 
 yourselves up against very formidable opponents nevertheless our team led by john baker assisted by graham wemyss and csms young 
 and chipping put up a fine performance despite two mishaps a faulty round and all the shots from an lmg 
 magazine finding their way on to an american target we finished second to the american team by only 57 points 
 some of our disappointment at this result was allayed by our winning the brigade and rhine army meetings bisley was 
 a slight disappoint

 in belgium and soltau respectively in 0:respec 0:tively 0:in the wettest possible weather and in oct we took part in 
 exercise pheasant tail again in filthy weather however a new and inspired use for armour emerged ralph stewart wilson discovered 
 that by lying his wet riflemen on the engine covers of tanks for 15 minutes they can be extracted crisp 
 dry and cheerful our recreations have apart from the normal games included ski ing at ehrwald in austria and at 
 bad lauterburg in the harz mountains and a new pastime go kart racing a go kart club has been formed 
 and provides for the members a new thrill and for the rest of us a shattering of the peace riding 
 too is a popular pastime and we have been represented at polo show jumping hunter trials and also at the 
 german races in the latter department cash desire owned by tommy wallis and paul greenwood has been outstanding having run 
 in eleven races and winning three and being placed in all the others bar one we were sorry to say 
 goodbye to david snowball in aug he has been a great success in the battalion and is much missed it 
 is good to know that the exchange of officers with the ppcli is to continue and we look forward to 
 welcoming his successor in the near future just before going to press we have heard that we are leaving baor

 the patrician 69 letter from england by captain m carleton smith the rifle brigade in one of the national daily 
 newspapers we have a feature called letters from america until your correspondent had been to that continent 0:con 0:tinent there 
 was no alternative but to humbly believe every detailed description but now following two years with the patricias and extensive 
 travelling one views these remarks with more discrimination many readers of the patrician have been to england this letter must 
 therefore of necessity follow the same text but perhaps england has changed since you readers were last on this side

 it too seriously the police are therefore in dire need of recruits and have so elevated the pay scales that 
 your part worn military correspondent would be earning more money as a junior police constable on the beat of course 
 with the last national serviceman grudgingly wondering why he had to be the last conscriptee and not the first of 
 the freemen the army too faces an acute shortage we eagerly await the day when it will pay the police 
 constable to try his prowess as a captain of infantry your correspondent since leaving canada seems to have had about 
 three months leave however he did find time to spend nine weeks on a company commanders course this proved to 
 be one more tactical error and was only rivalled by a memorable day at wainwright alberta when a coy 2 
 ppcli was 
 the patrician 70 first destroyed by a fantasian motor battalion then by a jet borne nerve gas attack followed twice 
 more by nuclear devices from both sides and yet within the same period of eighty minutes the gallant and imperturbable 
 0:imper 0:turbable remnants received eight different sets of orders for the same attack one might be forgiven for concluding that 
 this officer was badly in need of some sort of course and it was in this frame of mind that 
 he arrived at the school of infantry however after two years of soldiering with the regular professionals of the viscious 
 patricias as certain british colleagues have remembered calling them during the korean contest the course seemed very tame obsolescent and 
 uninteresting one s fellow students however added a certain amount of colour and if nothing else the understanding of current 
 affairs was made easier as one was taught by an australian and shared desks with spendid representatives from canada malaya

 lance corporals from the force republique should you readers too violently disagree with the opinions quoted in this letter from 
 england you are reminded that you are all welcome to slip over here and find that the green jackets depot 
 has open doors to all patricias indeed just a short time ago your correspondent attended a dinner here at which 
 brigadier ware was the guest of honour may i conclude by wishing all patricias and their families every good wish 
 for the future i want to again express my profound thanks and sincere gratitude for all the hospitality kindness opportunities

 the patrician 71 two years with the rifle brigade by lt jd snowball lt jd snowball returned from a two 
 year exchange posting with 3rd green jackets the rifle brigade in sep 60 and was posted to 1 ppcli he 
 is presently attached to the depot and is the platoon commander of korea platoon the thought occurred to me after 
 being told that i was to be the ppcli exchange officer with the rifle brigade that i knew very little 
 about our allied regiment enquiry showed that many others knew little more of the rifle brigade s activities since the 
 war most of us have been able to read of the early history of the rifle brigade but know nothing 
 of their contemporary history the official name of the rifle brigade at the moment is 3rd green jackets the rifle 
 brigade this is a result of an amalgamation in 1958 between the oxfordshire and buckinghamshire light infantry the kings royal 
 rifle corps and the rifle brigade of these three regiments the rb was junior and so became the third battalion 
 this amalgamation produced very little in the way of noticeable change to the regimental way of life of the rifle 
 brigade there is now a common green jackets depot in winchester which really meant that the ox and bucks came 
 to share a depot already being shared by the 60th and the rb there is a common green jackets shoulder 
 title with red lettering which originally caused some consternation since it is considered quite heretical to have any red on 
 a rifle brigade uniform a common cap badge is now worn by everyone there is also now a common green 
 jackets drill which has been devised from a combination of rifles and light infantry drill the only other noticeable manifestation 
 of change is the interchange of senior officers and senior ncos the commanding officer of the 2nd green jackets krrc 
 is from the rifle brigade and the commanding officer of the rifle brigade came from the krrc this process of 
 integration will probably be extended to the company commander 0:com 0:mander level in due course although there has been an 
 amalgamation between these three regiments there has in fact been no change in any of the regimental traditions of the 
 three each regiment still has its own colonel commandant 0:com 0:mandant field marshal sir francis festing the present cigs is 
 colonel commandant of the rifle brigade at the moment officers still wear 
 the patrician 72 their own regiment s dress uniform and mess kit each regiment maintains 0:main 0:tains and staffs its 
 own territorial army units although the rifle brigade had several battalions serving in the second war as motorized infantry they 
 now have only one battalion serving in a straight infantry role as part of 12 inf bde gp in germany 
 after the war 1 rb remained in germany until 1953 when they were warned for duty in korea having sent 
 their advance party they set sail only to be rerouted while at sea and ended up in kenya fighting the 
 mau mau from kenya the rifle brigade moved on to malaya where they remained until oct 1957 on their return 
 to england they were stationed in tidworth for one year and went to wuppertal germany in jun 1959 it was 
 aug 1958 that i arrived in tidworth to commence my two year posting i was congratulating myself for having missed 
 part of the wainwright concentration when i discovered that the battalion was not in tidworth but was on a training 
 concentration for about one month on salisbury plains two days later i was with them in the field as second 
 in command of b company a job i kept throughout my tour i was due for yet another shock the 
 rifle brigade was to go to germany in the new year and be stationed in wuppertal i had left hemer 
 twenty miles away only nine months before the circle would soon be complete army life being what it is things 
 were very similar to what i was used to and in no time at all i felt as if i 
 were a true rifleman everyone was kind and helpful although naturally somewhat curious at first i was surprised to find 
 everything decentralized to companies so that a rifle company had on its charge bedding barrack stores controlled stores pay and 
 a very formidable company account to be kept by me in a double entry ledger and to be audited every 
 quarter before going to germany life was mainly taken up with preparation for an inspection by the goc as well 
 as one by the then new colonel commandant after these inspections preparation for the move to germany 0:ger 0:many got 
 into high gear and in jan we were off life in baor is familiar to most ppcli personnel and it 
 was no different for the rb a constant round of signal exercises and field firing exercises as well as the 
 dozens of sports competitions made life quite hectic until we had a chance to get really settled in we had 
 close liaison with the canadian brigade and were able to use the belgian manoeuvre area quite frequently boxing is the 
 main sport in the rifle brigade and every year they produce several army champions the other important activity is shooting 
 and for two years the rifle brigade team represented the british army at the prix leclerc competition coming second to 
 the americans both times they won the rhine army championship in 1960 and of course send a team to bisley 
 each year a lot of attention is given to shooting and each year a battalion shooting meet lasting for two 
 days is held to decide the best shooting company this company receives a trophy and stands on the right of 
 the line on any important battalion parade the regimental birthday on 25 aug is a day of great celebration with 
 a fair in the afternoon at which each company produces several side 
 the patrician 73 shows and an all ranks dance in the evening the morning is taken up with inter company 
 soccer and culminates with a soccer game between the officers and sergeants which is run along the same lines as 
 our broom i 100 games on 17 mar the ending of national service in 1960 has had an effect on 
 many british regiments but the rifle brigade by means of a very well planned recruiting system has been able to 
 acquire a high rate of regular soldiers most of whom sign on for six years thereby giving the battalion a 
 good workable strength by peace time standards it is generally felt that this recruiting rate can be kept up and 
 probably increased when the unit leaves germany in jul of this year two years with the rifle brigade was a 
 wonderful experience i hope the exchange of officers is continued and i feel certain that any patricia who goes to 
 the rifle brigade or to the green jackets depot will feel at home make good friends and thoroughly enjoy himself

 the patrician 75 canadians in indo china by major h moncrief cd major moncriej returned to canada in the summer 
 of 1960 after a tour of one year in lndo china he is presently stationed at hq camp churchill introduction 
 the international commission for supervision and control icsc in viet nam is the result of the cease fire agreement signed 
 at geneva on 21 jul 1954 by the democratic republic of viet nam drvn and the french union forces fuf 
 ending the year war in lndo china the name lndo china to most conjures up images of saigon the exotic 
 orient intrigue and dien bien phu the aim of this article is to give a central picture of the story 
 of the icsc the role of canadians in that body and the conditions with which they are faced in their 
 daily lives geographical background lndo china lies on the eastern side of the great peninsula which thrusts southward between china 
 and india the location of this peninsula has caused it to be influenced by both great civilizations the physical barriers 
 of the area however have prevented an actual political or military meeting of the two countries so that the peninsula 
 is a zone where neighboring 0:neigh 0:boring countries have mingled it is situated in that part of asia dominated by 
 the monsoon climate the alternating wet and dry seasons greatly influence life as they do in all monsoon asia the 
 rice culture which the climate favours brings in its train all the social and economic problems common to the region 
 as a whole as in many other respects two climatic variations of the monsoon climate meet in lndo china physical 
 conditions within lndo china itself have tended to keep indian and chinese influences separated in fact prior to french occupation 
 0:occupa 0:tion the lndo china of today was but a loosely defined group of territories each influenced to a greater 
 or lesser degree by the impact of indian or chinese civilization the population density of lndo china is something in 
 the order of 200 per square mile and yet only some 12 15 of the country is cultivated and settled 
 large areas are virtually unpopulated thus repeating the south east asia pattern of congested areas and empty spaces standing side 
 by side the empty spaces are repugnant to people of the crowded coasts and deltas because the forests and mountains 
 of the interior are considered 
 the patrician 76 
 the patrician 77 to have endemic malaria whereas the lowlands are relatively free the barrier of malarial forests largely accounts 
 for the great success of coastal migrations from the north compared with overland movements which generally speaking have petered out 
 the population generally is concentrated in the valleys and deltas of two great rivers the mekong and the red and 
 those of many smaller rivers historical background the history of lndo china before the coming of the french is that 
 of a few ethnic groups separated by their culture and their geographical environments the most numerous vigorous and influential of 
 these groups were the annamites khmers ancestors of the present cambodians and the chams who have today largely disappeared in 
 the second century bc tonkin and a narrow coastal strip of annam became part of the chinese empire and remained 
 so for nearly a thousand years in the tenth century ad the annamites rose up against the chinese and regained 
 their independence the driving out of the chinese is said to have been led by the two trung sisters who 
 mounted on war elephants led the army in the uprising one of the principal streets in saigon is now named 
 hai ba trung two sisters trung in honour of this event and every year on women s national day a 
 large parade of hundreds of gaily attired ladies and school girls led by two girls in resplendent dress mounted on 
 two brilliantly painted elephants parade through the main district of saigon to commemorate this occasion after the expulsion of the 
 chinese the annamites gradually moved southward over southern annam during which process the chams were enslaved slaughtered or scattered penetrated 
 cochin china and came into forceful contact with the khmer people near what is now the cambodia viet nam border 
 and thus encountered the civilization introduced among the khmers from india the khmer kingdom had been most powerful during the 
 9th 13th century during which time the famous buildings at angkor one of the seven wonders were constructed this kingdom 
 however was weakened by southward movement of thai people from yunan and near the end of the 15th century the 
 capitol was moved to phnom penh which is the present capitol of cambodia the jungle rapidly covered the once magnificent 
 0:mag 0:nificent temples at angkor and only in the last 100 years were they rediscovered by french archaeologists who are 
 still uncovering many old structures which have remained hidden for almost 700 years french influence french intervention in indo china 
 resulted from dynastic wars among the annamite rulers one of whom gained the support of a french missionary 0:mis 0:sionary 
 this king obtained the approval of the chinese emperor to found the country of viet nam comprising tonkin cochin china 
 and annam he established good trade relations with france but his successors were not so favorably disposed towards that country 
 which led to increased intervention by france in 1858 cochin china become a french colony in 1867 cambodia became a 
 protectorate in 1863 tonkin and annam in 
 the patrician 78 1885 followed by laos in 1893 by the end of the 19th century these four protectorates and 
 one colony were grouped together as the indo chinese union indo china lost a great deal of its cohesion as 
 a result of the effects of world war ii on france and the japanese occupation in 1945 annamite nationalists formed 
 a government of viet nam comprising tonkin annam and cochin china the governments of cambodia and laos functioned separately from 
 the viet nam administration and feeling the need for greater security reached agreements with france regarding their future status with 
 the french union the french on the other hand removed viet nam authorities from office and re established their administration 
 in cochin china however much of the country remained in viet nam hands the leaders of the annamite nationalist party 
 the viet minh with ho chi minh as its leader insisted on the restoration of the union of the three 
 states which had a precedent eventually in 1946 an agreement 0:agree 0:ment was reached recognizing the independence of viet nam 
 within the french union but differences in the views of french and viet nam officials over the inclusion of cochin 
 china could not be resolved during the winter of 1946 47 hostilities broke out chinese influence at this point it 
 is well to dwell momentarily on the method by which the japanese capitulation was handled in indo china for it 
 was this act which created so many difficulties for the french during the freedom war the chinese were invited by 
 the allies in 1945 to take the japanese surrender down to the 16th parallel and to assume temporary control pending 
 return of the french at the same time the british had similarly been invited to assume temporary control south of 
 the 16th parallel this was necessary since at that point the french were not in a position to take the 
 japanese surrender the mission of the chinese and british troops north and south of the 16th parallel was to disarm 
 and concentrate some 60 000 japanese troops and to maintain internal security until the return of the french south of 
 the parallel this was expeditiously carried out by british and then french troops the japanese were rounded up and prevented 
 from passing their arms to the various local insurgents thus in the south incjuding saigon french civil authority was regained 
 north of the 16th parallel things were different and the events there had a profound effect on the course of 
 french authority in 1945 the chinese occupied the strategic centres but did not exercise control of the countryside the japanese 
 were allowed to give their arms to anti french insurgents and the chinese nationalists permitted armed japanese to enter the 
 service of the viet minh in whole detachments in feb 1946 an agreement was reached by which chinese nationalist troops 
 were to be replaced by french troops north of the 16th parallel but this was not carried out until the 
 damage had been done it is reported 
 the patrician 79 village market in south viet nam that the chinese official attitude of neutrality consisted of causing the 
 viet minh revolution to be ratified and in applying themselves to a veritable enterprise of pillage of the country when 
 the french fleet carrying french occupation troops returned to viet nam it was attacked by chinese guns at haiphong and 
 other incidents occurred there and at hanoi only after vigorous french protests and counter measures did the chinese troops leave 
 the country and then only after a last attempt at extortion by taking away 5000 tons of rice thus the 
 collaboration of the chinese with the viet minh was begun by the nationalists and has been carried on since although 
 at times covertly by the chinese communists who took over the central government 0:govern 0:ment of china in 1949 the 
 geneva agreements the outline details of the insurrection which was followed by full scale war in indo china are well 
 known the climax came in the spring of 1954 with the defeat of the french at dien bien phu by 
 the viet minh army under general giap the conduct of this battle demonstrated that the viet minh were no longer 
 a guerrilla army but could operate effectively as divisions and could control artillery most of which had been carried by 
 thousands and thousands of coolies south from china to the hills surrounding 0:sur 0:rounding dien bien phu the final declaration 
 of the geneva conference on the problem of restoring peace in indo china was made on 21 jul 54 and 
 took note of the agreements ending hostilities in viet nam laos and cambodia the conference also took note of the 
 agreements organizing international control 0:con 0:trol and supervision of the execution of the agreed provisions and on the same day 
 the co chairmen of the conference anthony eden and v 
 the patrician 80 molotov invited canada together with india and poland to designate representatives to the international supervisory commissions for 
 the three countries since the commission in laos was adjourned in 1958 and that for cambodia so reduced that it 
 is to all intents and purposes practically non existent the remainder of this article will be restricted to discussion of 
 activities in viet nam tasks of the commission the tasks of the icsc are laid out in article 36 of 
 the agreement which says the international commission shall be responsible for supervising 0:super 0:vising the proper execution by the parties 
 of the provisions of the agreement for this purpose it shall fulfill the tasks of control observation inspection and investigation 
 connected with the application 0:applica 0:tion of the provisions of the agreement on the cessation of hostilities and it shall 
 in particular a control the movement of the armed forces of the two parties effected within the framework of the 
 regroupment plan b supervise the demarcation lines between the regrouping areas and also the demilitarized zones c control the operations 
 of releasing prisoners of war and civilian internees d supervise at ports and airfields as well as along all frontiers 
 of viet nam the execution of the provisions of the agreement on the cessation of hostilities regulating the introduction into 
 the country of armed forces military personnel and of all kinds of arms munitions and war material other articles of 
 the agreement which produce much of the commission s 0:com 0:mission 0:s work at its various levels are art 14 
 preservation of civil liberties and prohibition of reprisals art 16 prohibition of troop reinforcement beyond the level existing 0:exist 0:ing 
 at the time of the cease fire art 17 prohibition of war material reinforcement beyond the level existing at the 
 time of the cease fire art 18 prohibition of the establishment of new military bases art 1 9 prohibition of 
 the establishment of military bases under the control of a foreign state and the prohibition of military alliances between either 
 north or south viet nam and foreign states thus south viet nam under this article may not become a member 
 of seato or any other military organization 0:organiza 0:tion the commission envisaged the establishment of fixed inspection teams composed of 
 an equal number of officers appointed by each of canada india and poland at the main points of entry to 
 both north and south viet nam to supervise the terms of the agreement to assist in the re groupment of 
 the forces the supervision of which was a major 
 the patrician 81 task of the commission s teams in the early days a provisional military demarcation line was fixed 
 approximately along the 17th parallel the forces of the french union were to regroup south of this line and the 
 forces of the peoples army of viet nam pavn to the north a demilitarized zone 5 kilometres in width was 
 established on each side of the demarcation line to act as a buffer zone and to assist in the prevention 
 0:preven 0:tion of incidents which might result in the resumption of hostilities the regroupment mentioned was to be completed within 
 300 days of the cessation of hostilities at no time was the demarcation line 17th parallel considered as a political 
 boundary but rather an aid to the separation of the combatant parties general 14a elections were to be held in 
 jul 56 to elect the party which would govern the entire country both north and south of the 17th parallel 
 as is well known these elections have never been held because of a variety of reasons but mainly because of 
 south vietnamese reluctance we are thus faced with a very confusing situation both the democratic republic at viet nam north 
 viet nam headed by ho chi minh and the government of viet nam south viet nam headed by ngo dinh 
 diem maintain that they are the lawful government of the whole country ho chi minh s government being apparently sponsored 
 and certainly recognized by communist china while diem s government is sponsored by usa and recognized by most western governments 
 including usa whilst the geneva agreement of 1954 put an end to outright hostilities 0:hos 0:tilities in this unhappy country 
 it has not ended terrorism subversion or sabotage it is worth reminding the reader at this point that the agreement 
 0:agree 0:ment was signed on one hand by north viet nam and on the other hand by the french but 
 not by the south vietnamese government thus with the withdrawal of the french the south has an agreement imposed upon 
 it to which it is not a signatory the question which quite obviously arises is how binding or legal is 
 the agreement as far as the government of the south is concerned fortunately the south have said that in the 
 interests of peace they will observe the terms of the agreement commission operation at all levels of the commission work 
 is carried out on the committee system of three members in all investigations or discussions where unanimity is not achieved

 one of the committees 0:com 0:mittees for consideration if unanimity cannot be obtained at this point the matter becomes a

 close to sea level that tidal action is easily apparent in the rivers and canals around saigon this tidal action 
 is in fact the chief sewage system whilst saigon has a definite tropical climate there are several distinct 0:dis 0:tinct 
 climatic variations the rainy season extends from jun to nov with frequent daily downpours lasting perhaps thirty or forty minutes 
 some relief from the heat is felt during the showers but the excessive humidity is constantly apparent dec and jan

 within the vicinity of ninety degrees from feb through may the weather continues hot and in spite of the lack 
 of rain the humidity remains at a high level saigon itself is a delightful city of broad tree lined streets 
 boulevards attractive villas sidewalk cafes a maze of shops traders and a teeming mass of humanity it is a city 
 of many contrasts where one may see a large modern american car driven by a bare foot vietnamese a palatial

 through any of its streets is always an exhilarating experience in agility and bargaining ability upon arrival in saigon the 
 flights undergo a whirlwind briefing and indoctrination into the functioning of the commission make arrangements for tailoring etc and attend 
 various social functions welcoming them to viet nam the first three days are extremely hectic and with the hot humid 
 weather many leave for one of the team sites wondering just what happened gradually however things fall into place and 
 one falls into the routine of team life which can be as dull or as interesting as one desires 
 the patrician 84 north side of ben hai biver communist slogans and doves of peace on arch team composition and 
 duties teams are composed of an equal number of officers from each of india canada poland with the indian officer 
 acting as chairman as he does at all levels of the commission since english is the official language of the 
 commission the polish delegation also provides a polish interpreter for their member a liaison officer is provided at each team 
 site by the appropriate liaison mission and it is his responsibility to make all the necessary arrangements for the team 
 to do its duties this includes the security of the team which is also a responsibility of the liaison mission 
 team duties differ considerably at the various time sites and are much more rigorous at some than at others generally 
 speaking the teams duties fall into two categories fixed controls and mobile controls in the case of fixed controls the 
 team visits harbour railway and port facilities to check on the import or export of war material and personnel mobile 
 controls are directed towards the observance of all articles of the agreement 0:agree 0:ment but particularly those which prohibit bases 
 and are carried out within the zone of action of the team frequency of control of these points is laid 
 down by the commission and the necessary facilities and arrangements 0:arrange 0:ments ma de by the appropriate liaison mission team 
 life life at the team sites differs considerably depending upon whether it is a northern or southern site the time 
 of the year and the facilities available at the location with perhaps two exceptions all of the southern team sites 
 are more pleasant than those in the north the reasons for this are numerous but can probably be reduced to 
 three major ones a accommodation at dong dang and muong sen both northern teams the team lives in bamboo huts 
 with dirt floors at the 
 the patrician 85 other northern sites while the accommodation may be acceptable there are many inadequacies such as fans light 
 plumbing and in winter heat b diet and health ln both north and south the quartering and provisioning 0:pro 0:visioning 
 of the team is a responsibility of the liaison mission concerned i e pavn or svn liaison mission in the 
 south the problem is overcome by issuing a cash meal allowance to team members who then make their own arrangements 
 in the case of canadian team officers they normally purchase a small stock of ready to eat items from the 
 canadian stores in saigon so that a measure of control can be exercised over what is consumed for health reasons 
 generally speaking it is unwise to patronize native restaurants aus military advisory assistance group maag mess is located near most 
 southern team sites and almost invariably 0:in 0:variably the canadian team member is invited to dine such is not the 
 case in the north however there are no restaurants and no maag messes anything eaten by the team members must 
 be prepared by themselves or by the cook provided by the pavn since one is suspicious of any item of 
 food which is not recognizable 0:recogniz 0:able northern diets have a tendency to dwindle to a seldom changing menu of 
 poulet ct encore poulet with an occasional goat or water buffalo for variety the variety is seldom appreciated c local 
 pressures while it may not be entirely true that the pavn exerts pressure on the team or its members a 
 canadian officer in the north is continually reminded that he is in a communist state and subject to the whims 
 of any of its officials restrictions are placed on individual movements and activities photography is forbidden there are no social 
 amenities one is continually a witness to party propaganda and on all sides can be seen the results of the 
 enlightenment during the past few years the team is subject to subtleties and innuendoes daily which makes the performance of 
 duties difficult and frustrating conclusion canadian military personnel are now completing their seventh year of service with the icsc in 
 viet nam which has once again become an area of concern because of recent events in laos that they are 
 carrying out an extremely important duty is only too apparent when one compares the laotian situation where the icsc stands 
 adjourned to that in viet nam where the commission is still active whilst the commission appears to be a slow 
 moving and rather powerless body the mere fact of its presence appears to have prevented a recurrence of the 1946 
 54 hostilities nothing within the duties of a team officer can be even remotely compared 0:com 0:pared to normal military 
 duties or training the posting is however an interesting and educational experience in minor diplomatic tasks as well as an 
 important one in the preservation of peace in south east asia

 article lt col niven dso mc ret was the adjutant at the time this action took place he was awarded 
 a military cross jor his gallant cool and conspicous actions on this day these are his impressions as he recalls 
 them the regiment was relieved in polygon wood on the evening of the 4th of may by the shropshires after 
 having spent twelve days under constant shelling which on at least two occasions developed into the severest bombardment during this 
 period we had lost one quarter of our strength conducted a difficult withdrawal and had helped to establish a new 
 line of defence on the 4th of may alone we suffered 122 casualties from an all day bombardment on the 
 sth of may lt col buller was struck by a shell splinter and was evacuated with a wound that cost 
 him the sight of one of his eyes fortunately hammie gault had rejoined the regiment on the 3rd of may 
 and was available to command on the evening of the 6th of may we relieved the shropshires on bellewaerde ridge 
 our strength at this time was 14 officers and less than 600 men the officers were all junior subalterns except 
 major gault capt agar adamson capt hs hill and capt hs dennison i do not feel that bellewaerde ridge was 
 our position on the bth of may there may have been a ridge somewhere but i don t recall seeing 
 it during the fighting on the bth i could clearly distinguish germans forming up behind a hedge about three hundred 
 yards from our position on higher ground the trenches we occupied could not really be called trenches they were in 
 fact sandy ditches about three feet deep the shropshires had done their best to strengthen the fire trenches and had 
 dug the beginning of a communication trench between the front and support lines in any event the higher ground on 
 the enemy s left commanded 0:com 0:manded it and it was of little use in daylight action the two lines 
 of firing trenches were inadequate and poorly sited the forward line consisted 0:con 0:sisted of two unconnected trenches lying in 
 a very exposed position more or less followed a track from hooge and was lined by large tall trees by 
 noon of the bth not a vestige of a tree could be seen two companies 0:com 0:panies held the forward 
 line number 3 being on the right with no 4 on the left the german artillery fire was heavy though 
 not as bad as on the 4th of may the forward line was accurately and persistently shelled all through may

 the patrician 93 lines and satisfied that things were in hand retired for the night behind a big tree that 
 was situated in a hollow about 0600 hours on the bth of may we were awakened by heavy shell and 
 rifle fire we immediately rushed up a track to see what was going on the troops were standing to in 
 readiness for an assault on the position we proceeded forward to no 1 company which was under command of capt 
 hs dennison three machine guns were in position and under command of lt van den berg and cpl mckenzie capt 
 agar adamson was in command of no 2 company on the left at about 0700 hours the heavier guns joined 
 in and bellewaerde ridge seemed alive with the flashing and crashing of bursting shells in the lulls of gunfire the 
 rifle and machine gun fire on the position was intense and caused heavy casualties about 0800 or 0900 hours germans 
 could be seen about three hundred yards to our front and some were seen advancing to the left of our 
 position i heard agar adamson had been hit and hammie gault was badly hit and barely semi conscious for the 
 rest of the day i attended to him frequently and got him propped up against a dead soldier so he 
 was lengthwise in the trench in the afternoon after a heavy attack by infantry hammie whispered to me next time 
 they come on stand me up face me the right way and give me my revolver sometime during the morning 
 rsm fraser was shot through the head he seized the colour jumped out of the trench waving it aloft and 
 shouted insults at the enemy the colour was hit with bullets and even the pike was pierced by them i 
 jumped out dragged him back into the frezenberg may 8 1915 
 the patrician 94 trench and gave him three pills that put him to sleep i then folded up the colour 
 and put it into its water proof casing several messages were received from brigade headquarters telling us to withdraw as 
 they could not give us any support i advised them that we had too many wounded and there was no 
 way of evacuating them about 1500 hours a runner reached me with a message to go to a telephone at 
 the other side of the lake to speak to the brigadier the route back to the lake was very exposed 
 the first six hundred yards being over open ground by running and dodging i made it to the telephone 0:tele 
 0:phone situated at the headquarters of the rifle brigade and spoke to the brigadier i advised him again that because 
 we had so many wounded personnel it was impossible to withdraw but that if he would send a couple of 
 companies and sufficient stretcher bearers after dark we could all get out the commanding officer of the rifle brigade insisted 
 that i take two of his men as escort back to our position i protested that it would attract fire 
 but was overruled both riflemen were killed on the way back and i sent their identity discs back three days 
 later they could not run as fast as i could early in the day i saw that our supply of 
 303 ammuntion was going to run out with little if any possibility of any re supply i ordered everyone 0:every 
 0:one to collect bandoliers and all ammunition from the dead here i would like to pay tribute to pioneer sergeant 
 dean t who collected boxes of 303 ammunition from our left hoisted them on his shoulders and marched bravely across 
 to our lines he did this many times and although exposed to heavy fire he was never hit our most 
 wonderful man on this day was corporal christie of the scout section prior to enlistment christie was a bear hunter 
 in the yukon he was a deadly shot up to two hundred yards never wasting a shot during world war 
 ihe killed hundreds of the enemy on this day he lay full length in front of our trenches firing steadily 
 and his quota was very high even i got a good many at a hundred yards as it was nearly 
 impossible to miss i considered there were three main attacks in force during the day each being preceded by heavy 
 shelling the rifle fire from our trenches during these attacks was devastating and the rifles sounded like machine guns it 
 seemed to me there were mounds of enemy dead right up to our frontline none got into our trenches that 
 i saw and it was only after no 1 company withdrew that some did filter in our number of effectives 
 had diminished rapidly about 1600 hours the 28th division began a counter attack in force and some lost ground was 
 retaken about 1700 hours the bombardment on bellewaerde ridge died away as the germans concentrated their fire on the counter 
 attack force when night fell we commenced burying our dead and evacuating the wounded about 2330 hours the 3rd krr 
 arrived to take over the trenches and shortly after that i moved out with three other officers and 150 men

 these attempts proved successful however and harassing fire from one 25 pounder prevented the chinese from fulfilling their intention of 
 digging in on the 6 platoon s hill by 0600 hours the enemy was not to be seen and shortly 
 thereafter a reconnaissance patrol sent to the 6 platoon feature reported the chinese to be withdrawing to the north there 
 were 140 enemy dead lying about and only four men of b company had been killed the company position remained 
 secure 5 if d company on the battalion s west flank felt at all envious listening to the fire fight 
 in b company s area they did not remain so for long as colonel stone observed it was apparent that 
 the east flank attack concentrated as it was was only diversionary 6 d company on the west suddenly came under 
 great pressure to adequately defend the approaches to the feature the company commander captain jgw mills 7 found it necessary 
 to take up a position along the ridge in a more or less elongated z formation 8 11 platoon the 
 company mortar position and one mmg were on the right flank 12 platoon company headquarters and the other mmg were 
 centrally located while 10 platoon on higher ground defended the left flank as 10 platoon was separated from the rest 
 of the company by a small saddle the central mmg and one section of 12 platoon had been sited so

 the patrician 103 cover this gap in addition it commanded another saddle farther to the west this latter ground appeared 
 to be an obvious approach and was designated as df task fox iii shortly after midnight 10 platoon spotted the 
 enemy in area of fox iii grouping for an assault on their position and opened with lmg fire the platoon 
 commander lt levy 0 requested the mmg in platoon position to supply additional support informed of the enemy s location 
 the company commander immediately called down the fire task on the saddle the mmg fire proved tremendously effective being fired 
 with such deadly accuracy that it completely disrupted the enemy attack on 10 platoon the chinese therefore directed their next 
 assault past 10 platoon across the connecting saddle and by sheer weight of numbers overran the mmg and its supporting 
 section from 12 platoon the mmg crew continued firing into the waves of oncoming chinese until the section position was 
 completely overrun four men from this section plus two koreans managed to make their way over to 10 platoon where 
 they reported that the two machine gunners had died at their post accurate lmg fire from 10 platoon rendered the 
 captured mmg useless seeking to maintain the momentum of their attack the enemy pressed on under covering mortar and machine 
 gun fire towards the remaining 12 platoon position and continued to build up strength on all sides of the company 
 as these build ups increased the company commander called down artillery and mortar concentrations in order to disrupt the enemy 
 s attempts to organize a concerted attack initially all platoons were able to hold off the chinese efforts to close 
 by the extensive use of grenades however enemy pressure began to tell and the grenades ran short enemy mortar fire 
 pounded continuously at the platoon positions and soon destroyed the lmg position on 11 platoon s extreme right flank by 
 now the chinese had isolated 10 platoon from the rest of the company had gained control of the connecting saddle 
 and had completely surrounded 11 and 12 platoons plus company headquarters the situation became desperate and at approximately 0300 hours

 the patrician 104 that his position had been overrun the handwriting appeared to be on the wall not to be 
 outdone capt mills quickly warned company personnel to remain in their trenches and called down all supporting artillery and mortar 
 fire on his own position after some two hours of bombardment the artillery and mortar fire finally drove the determined 
 but unprotected enemy off the ridge and back down the slopes here they regrouped and taking up positions some 400 
 yards distant continued to harass the company 0:com 0:pany with sporadic small arms fire keeping 10 platoon virtually pinned to 
 the ground with close in sniper action enemy bugles and whistles sounded periodically from their positions for the rest of 
 the night and throughout the next day but the chinese made no effort to mount another attack when the pressure 
 eased off d company had a breather in which to take stock of the situation the count of casualties proved 
 to be seven killed five wounded and none missing ll a remarkably low casualty rate considering the enemy numbers and 
 the fierce close quarter fighting as for enemy casualties it was practically impossible to determine them as the chinese had 
 carried off the great majority of their dead and wounded from c company came a platoon of re enforcements under 
 lt whittaker 0:whit 0:taker which strengthened by a section from 12 platoon moved into position to recapture at the cost 
 of three casualties the mmg which had been left by the enemy on an exposed ridge as the enemy action 
 was now almost entirely restricted to sniping the company s situation appeared relatively secure and was made even more so 
 by the arrival of a supply of ammunition and lt ah constant s 12 platoon from battalion headquarters with great 
 determination d company had held its position against tremendous odds and had inflicted heavy casualties on the persistent and seemingly 
 numberless enemy when the situation was at its grimmest and the trenches appeared to be overrun the company commander saved 
 the day by his courageous decision to bring down artillery and mortar fire on his own position concerning the effectiveness 
 of this decision 11 captain mills notes 12 now major constant continental home supply ltd quality furniture and appliances discount

 the patrician 105 captain mills later remarked the reason we were able to hold our hill was the support we 
 received from the artillery and mortars in the remaining hours of darkness the enemy continued to mount strong probing attacks 
 on the battalion s position searching in vain for a weak point none was to be found not one inch 
 of the battalion area was given to the enemy 13 even before first light came on the 25th it was 
 all too obvious that the 2 ppcli stood alone completely surrounded by the enemy who had sealed off the only 
 road back to brigade with this normal channel of communication and supply no longer available and with the battalion dangerously 
 short of ammunition water and rations lt col stone at approximately 0300 hours sent an urgent request to brigade for 
 an emergency airdrop the battalion s morale at a high level throughout the action rose still higher when at 1100 
 hours the requested airdrop was made by three american flying boxcars unfortunately however the necessary british pattern ammunition had not 
 been included in the drop this might have proved to be a serious omission but for the fact that the 
 ist middlesex regiment in reserve to the south of the battalion had spent the morning clearing the enemy forces blocking 
 the supply road by 1400 hours the all important link to brigade was re opened so that additional supplies were 
 trucked into the patricia s lines the battalion was now prepared to duplicate its feat of the previous night if 
 need be but no further chinese attacks were forthcoming the patricia position had proved to be a formidable fortress position 
 and the chinese having found it impossible to dislodge the defenders had no intention of trying again their forces at 
 least two regiments strong had suffered hundreds of casualties a high price to pay for the minor casualtiees inflicted on 
 the canadians 14 many may wonder why the chinese suffered so many casualties and 2 ppcli so few one reason 
 was that the chinese telegraphed the direction and timing of their attacks by using mmg tracer ammunition 13 lt col

 the patrician 106 for direction and sounding bugles as signals to form up on their start line and for their 
 assault this gave company and platoon commanders time to bring down accurate artillery mortar and machine gun fire on them 
 the second reason was that before attacking the chinese did not accurately locate our defensive positions by patrolling or give 
 accurate artillery and mortar supporting fire to their attacking troops the steep gradients to our positions forced the chinese to 
 use a monkey run attitude in their final assault although rifle fire in the darkness was not too effective at 
 such small targets grenades trundled down the hills had a devastating effect when ammunition was low rocket launchers were used 
 in a deadly anti personnel role the chinese appeared to be well trained and disciplined but appeared to lack initiative 
 only on orders would their squads fire their weapons or throw grenades their consistent attacks en masse on obvious approaches 
 in an attempt to overwhelm our positions by sheer weight of numbers presented ideal targets for our artillery and mortars 
 during the early hours of the evening of the 25th their task carried out to the letter 2 ppcli handed 
 over their position still surrounded by mounds of enemy dead to an american unit in recognition of their heroic stand 
 which prevented the chinese from cutting off and annihilating the withdrawing american and korean forces 2 ppcli was awarded the 
 united states presidential citation the only canadian unit ever to be so honored while the text of the citation pays 
 extensive tribute to the fighting qualities of the patricias perhaps the compliment the battalion appreciated the most was the one 
 paid to it by its own commanding officer lt col jr stone in the annals of history of the korean 
 war it will be said that the 2nd bn ppcli did not give an inch although attacked by overwhelming 0:over 
 0:whelming numbers with a front crumbling all around them cut off and with everything else pulling back the 2nd bn

 the patrician 107 customs of the service by lt di ross it is relatively easy to interest service personnel in 
 matters directly connected with their everyday duties but there are certain functions such as saluting ceremonial guards matters of dress 
 and other traditional activities which inspire less enthusiasm amongst both officers and men a knowledge of the origin and meaning 
 of these customs will however make them more significant and will remove antipathy towards them the titles used for military 
 ranks sometimes seem puzzling why for instance should a lieutenant general be senior to a major general whereas a lieutenant 
 is junior to a major the explanation of this is that major generals were once referred to as sergeant major 
 generals but with the passage of time the title became abbreviated to major general the word lance as used in 
 lance corporal or lance sergeant means lance in the literal sense at one time mounted men were considered superior to 
 those on foot if a mounted man at arms became unhorsed in battle he continued to fight on foot but 
 the lance he carried indicated his former rank and gave him a certain prestige the rank bombardier has its origin 
 in the man who looked after the bombard or mortar much of our military vocabulary has its origin in languages 
 other than english consider the following terms for example bugle this was originally a french word meaning wild ox the 
 bugle horn as it was first called thus meant wild ox horn cashier from the dutch casseeren meaning to break 
 furlough this word is also derived from the dutch language the dutch word was verlof which meant for leave furlough 
 used to be pronounced to rhyme with cough grenade derived from the spanish word granada which means pomegranate the original 
 grenades being of that shape platoon from the swedish peleton which was a unit of forty eight men roster is 
 probably from the dutch roaster meaning gridiron 0:grid 0:iron the original lists were drawn up on paper lined like a 
 gridiron 
 the patrician 108 trail arms this command was originally trayle your pikes the soldier would seize his pike by the 
 head and allow the long shaft to trail behind him the ceremony of tattoo had its origin in the low 
 countries during the late 1600 s the name probably comes from the dutch expression doe den tap toe which means 
 turn off the taps at approximately 9 30 each evening an officer a sergeant and a drummer from a british 
 unit stationed in the area would assemble at the end of a village on a signal from the officer the 
 drummer would commence beating and the three would march through the main streets when the tavern keeper heard the sound 
 of the drum they would remark doe den tap toe and turn off their taps the officer and sergeant would 
 check all the inns and taverns to ensure no soldiers remained in them and when satisfied would return to their 
 quarters the custom of beating taptoe or tattoo as it came to be called soon became a general practise throughout 
 the british army in the course of time a flute player joined the drummer and short tunes were played then 
 whole corps of drums flutes or pipes and eventually bands played music for the entertainment of the garrisons the modern 
 tattoo ceremony has its origin in the display given at the royal pavilion aldershot in 1894 in honour of a 
 visit by queen victoria during the evening ceremonies groups of regimental bands drums and pipes each group playing its own 
 regimental tunes converged in rotation from north south east and west on to a central point where they massed killa

 the patrician 109 and played a programme of music for an hour following this the last post was played on 
 the massed bugles and the parade dispersed this tattoo was regarded as a great success and was repeated in subsequent 
 years it is now an established ceremony throughout the british and commonwealth armies the tradition of spit and polish probably 
 commenced when warriors began to demand shining armour armour eventually went out of vogue but the spit and polish stayed 
 some of the old recipes for raising a shine are still known to us in the 15th century for example 
 the knight s followers cleaned his armour with a mixture of pumice powder and olive oil chain mail was cleaned 
 in a special barrel mounted on an axle and revolved by a handle swords and bayonets were cleaned with brick 
 dust when buttons first came into use they did not have to be polished but were cleaned with a mixture 
 of pumice powder and whitening as the material used in the manufacture of buttons changed so did the methods of 
 cleaning and chemical cleaners made their appearance in the 17th and 18th centuries soldiers tarred their leather equipment to render 
 it waterproof in a hot climate this presented problems as the tar had a tendency to run as the temperature 
 rose later pipe clay was used to whiten equipment and breeches the pipe clay did not stick well and required 
 several coats to do the job that one coat of bianco would do blanco came into use in 1875 for 
 whitening buckskin equipment with the advent of khaki bianco was manufactured in new shades and today there are a number 
 of different vogues the composition of bianco has remained a trade secret insurance is not a cut and dried affair

 the patrician 111 as recently as seventy years ago troops used blacking made of oil vitrol of molasses and carbon 
 black to polish foot wear and harnesses wax polish was then introduced and blacking became a thing of the past 
 one custom which fortunately is no longer present in the army is that of duelling in the 18th and 19th 
 centuries duelling was an accepted method of settling disputes between members of the british upper class it is not surprising 
 therefore that british officers who came for the most part from this class regarding duelling as part of their way 
 of life the practise was discouraged by most commanding officers including wellington after his retirement from the army however when 
 wellington 0:welling 0:ton was prime minister he challenged and duelled with lord winchelsea who had attacked wellington s character during 
 a debate in parliament normally the duel was fought at dawn with matched pistols at a distance of fifteen paces 
 seconds and a surgeon were present if both parties missed on the first shot they were allowed to re load 
 and fire again seconds were considered necessary to ensure the duel had been fair in all respects a frequent cause 
 of duelling within the services was the over consumption 0:over 0:con 0:sumption of wines during an evening in the mess 
 insults were quickly thrown or imagined and the duelling pistols as quickly sent for commanding 0:command 0:ing officers might find 
 themselves challenged by a junior officer over a real or imagined slight and because of the code of honour could 
 not refuse the challenge those who were killed were entered in the records as having died of some disease the 
 wounded were entered as having injured themselves usually on horseback the question as to whether or not soldiers should be 
 allowed to grow facial hair has long been a subject of controversy during the 18th century ragged bristling walrus type 
 moustaches were worn by the hungarian 0:hun 0:garian hussars with the purpose of giving a war like appearance when hussars 
 were introduced into the french army every hussar was obliged to grow a similar moustache if the result was not 
 considered acceptable the soldier was obliged to paint a moustache on his face with blacking when the weather was warm 
 the blacking would dry and tighten up the skin in a painful manner british soldiers remained clean shaven until after 
 the peninsular war and waterloo when probably due to their contact with continental troops moustaches began to appear for a 
 time there appeared to be some uncertainty 0:uncer 0:tainty as to the orders governing the growth of facial hair though 
 the adjutant general went on record in 1828 as stating that he thought the practise un english and a hindrance 
 to recruiting in 1830 however an order was issued forbidding the growth of moustachios except by household 0:house 0:hold cavalry 
 and hussars some debate on the subject continued until the crimean war in 1854 when the wearing of moustaches became 
 optional during the first world war 1914 18 the wearing of the moustache was also made optional as it is
