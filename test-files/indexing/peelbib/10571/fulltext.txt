 the colonel of the regiment major general g g brown ostj cd once again it is my very great pleasure 
 to send my very best wishes to all members of our regimental family wherever they are serving in our three 
 regular battalions 2 airborne commando now serving in cyprus on extra regimental employment in our fourth battalion the loyal edmonton 
 regiment or now retired and serving in other ways this year just past has been an exciting one not just 
 because of the training activities although rendezvous 0:ren 0:dezvous 81 in cfb gagetown certainly was an outstanding 0:out 0:standing effort 
 but also because of our colonel in chiefs visit to several elements of her regiment this visit marked her first 
 visit to canada since her return to regimental duty and it played a tremendous part in cementing regimental ties and 
 raising espirt de corps and this of course as i have said many times before is intertwined with our training 
 and capability to defend our country it was an inspiration for all of us to have her with us once 
 again in the short period of time she spent in canada she was able to visit her first battalion in 
 calgary her second battalion in winnipeg elements of her patricias in petawawa and many serving and retired patricias journeyed to 
 ottawa from montreal kingston and toronto to join with ottawa patricias in a wonderful and heart warming reception for her 
 there the blend of the formal and the informal as lady patricia participates in the ceremonial aspects of these visits 
 the happiness of being together as a family and sharing these events bring us all closer together as a family 
 and renews old memories and brings lasting new ones to all of us i would like to extend my warmest 
 congratualtions to all patricias for an outstanding effort in so many areas of endeavour during this past year 1 
 2 the splendid united nations tour of our second airborne commando in cyprus the highly successful 0:success 0:ful training programme 
 mentioned earlier that took place this summer in gagetown b coy of our first battalion and their highly successful work 
 with the british in live firing exercises in suffield the inspiring performance of the second battalion as they celebrated the 
 30th anniversary of the battle of kapyong in winnipeg in april of this year and the outstanding welcome they gave 
 to their former commanding 0:com 0:manding officer colonel jim stone and the officers and men who joined them to reflect 
 upon that great battle the exciting tattoo performed in victoria by our third battalion on 24 may and the exercising 
 of their freedom of the city of victoria the magnificent display 0:dis 0:play of discipline and professionalism provided by the 
 first battalion when they trooped the colour with excellence and precision in front of our colonel in chief and hundreds 
 of spectators on that cold rainy morning of 8 may in honour of the battle of frezenberg 0:frezen 0:berg finally 
 and by no means least in importance the tremendous work often low in profile being done by patricias with cadets 
 the militia and in our schools and training establishments across the country and those many other extra regimental tasks which 
 are difficult and so necessary and which so many members 0:mem 0:bers of our regiment are called upon to perform 
 and do so very well we must also recognize the splendid quiet support being provided by the wives and families 
 of our members 0:mem 0:bers throughout all of these varied and essential tasks and particularly those families of our patricias 
 in 2 airborne commando serving in cyprus with the united nations the association continued to grow and thrive this year 
 the sad passing of andy mills of the edmonton branch and oop mcphail of the vancouver branch remind us all 
 that time is passing quickly and of the importance of the comradeship friendship and support provided to so many by 
 our association i have enjoyed the opportunity of meeting and speaking 0:speak 0:ing to so many of you throughout the 
 year and i look forward to the year to come and meeting with so many more of you and wish

 3 historical note tracy richardson gunner extraordinaire of the princess patricia s allan levine the machine gun section salisbury plain 
 october 1914 with major andrew hamilton gault on the left editor s note as a result of the article entitled 
 the originals by major l e grimshaw cd more information 0:infor 0:mation on no 865 tracy richardson has come to 
 light the following article by allan levine ex qor of c has been reproduced and hopefully will give readers a 
 further insight into the individual character of one of our originals january 1915 the time was desperate for the allies 
 true to their schlieffen plan the germans had launched their juggernaut across the top of western europe and allied armies 
 hard pressed though they were had checked the enemy tide into a deadly stalemate 0:stale 0:mate of trench warfare that 
 would endure for almost four years in the process hundreds of thousands of men on both sides would be killed 
 maimed and gassed and afterward the war to end all wars would be still to come in the meantime every 
 german strength had to be countered with equal strength on the part of the allies and recruiting in north america 
 and elsewhere became a serious pursuit of all their forces it was into this scenario that tracy custer richardson tall 
 lanky missourian soldier of fortune and machine gunner extraordinary emerged where there was a fight there also was tracy he 
 enlisted with the ppcli at levis quebec in september 1914 as a private though in reality if his prior rank 
 in various latin american armies were counted he d have outranked most of the regiment 0:regi 0:ment and shortly thereafter 
 shipped out for england ralph hodder williams history is a bit short of personal 0:per 0:sonal detail given that each 
 and every man in the regiment could warrant a book but we do learn that tracy no 865 was wounded 
 on 4 may 1915 struck off strength 1 june 1915 and was subsequently a lieutenant in the 97th battalion a 
 short lived commission 0:com 0:mission in view of the fact that the 97th was used as reinforcements for the ppcli 
 and rcr 
 4 the hell of trench warfare has been aptly recalled by many who were there and perhaps most eloquently by 
 those who knew they might not return tracy however 0:how 0:ever seems to have led something of a charmed life 
 in a series which he later wrote for liberty magazine he described in believable detail the role of the ppcli 
 in keeping up their part of the line dealing with snipers in the belgin sector of the front surviving all 
 manner of privations and at one point bivouacking for three days with cooking fire ablaze over a concealed guncotton 0:gun 
 0:cotton dump until ordered out by a shocked party of sappers the fighting around st eloi famous for its overgrown 
 mound of discarded bricks is legion the patricia s fixed bayonets planted its machine guns and got on with the 
 unpleasant job of reducing the german population of st elio to zero as richardson describes it there was no science 
 or strategy or tactics 0:tac 0:tics in that fight just primitive hand to hand but when it was over after 
 two hours of that sort of stuff the only germans in st eloi were dead it was this kind of 
 desperate warfare in which tracy excelled but was not totally immune to bullets and bombs he had designed and executed 
 a new design for a machine gun emplacement and in the process having eliminated an abandoned trench by filling it 
 in thereby saving lives he d been recommended for the victoria cross however col farquhar the regimental commander 0:com 0:mander 
 was killed the same day and richardson was never decorated his decorations were more in the order of shell fragments 
 bullet holes and a bayonet wound in the thigh kamerad shouted the soldier who d missed him tracy calmly blew 
 the man s face off with a 45 and spent the rest of the day bleeding after being gassed shunted 
 around from hospital to hospital operated on but declared medically unfit because he was paralyzed from a wound in his 
 spine tracy was mustered out after only four months of combat 0:com 0:bat yet in those four months he saw 
 more action than any other man sees in his whole life what one wonders was the origin of this remarkable 
 soldier a credit to the ppcli and every other unit in which he served and what became of him after 
 the war depending on which history one reads or which tall tale he was born in 1889 or 1892 in 
 west union or broken bow nebraska one of four children of a general contractor he grew up in lamar missouri 
 another of whose favourite sons was harry truman and embarked on a career in the oil business a venture that 
 was short lived he and a friend took the first boat out of new orleans joined the american legion under 
 general gabe conrad and helped in the unseating of the tyrant zelaya along with the man who was to become 
 0:be 0:come his lifelong friend sam dreben the fighting jew when this bit of action was over tracy sam and 
 a man who was to figure later in a great deal of caribbean and isthmian intrigue guy ross machine gun 
 molony signed on with the dynamic central american king maker lee christmas the greatest of his ilk since william walker 
 was stood against a wall and they proceeded to unseat another tyrant or seat another tyrant depending on one s 
 point of view in honduras by now tracy s prowess with a machine gun was more powerful than a professional 
 resume he signed on with a venezuelan junta for a brief period in 1911 and then teamed up with sam 
 dreben for three years of adventure all across northern mexico with more than enough close calls tracy is reportedly the 
 only gringo to stick a gun in pancho villa s ribs and tell about it afterward it was in the 
 vera cruz landings that tracy s services were most valuable to general funston but tracy got wind of the war 
 in europe and wound up in the ppcli after the war his life was considerably less violent he was arrested 
 in 1922 for killing his best friend in self defence but was acquitted he married but his wife died tragically 
 shortly afterward of a respiratory disease he had numerous jobs as a writer miner stock promoter real estate salesman private 
 detective and treasury agent his closest friends predeceased him by many years lee christmas died of tropical spruce in a 
 new orleans charity ward in 1923 sam dreben succumbing to paresis died of a drug overdose 0:over 0:dose in a 
 los angeles hospital in 1925 of his other friends little is known beyond guy molony who was buried in new 
 orleans after a full life of 88 years the only ppcli member on record at least on tracy s record 
 to keep up communications with him was frederick faust also known as max brand a writer like tracy but an 
 eminently successful one early in 1925 an obscure little newspaper in bartow florida the polk county record came out with 
 an article on tracy and sam dreben on the sad occasion of sam s death on the masthead of that 
 paper was the name of one wallace stevens and one asks whether it is the same wallace stevens who was 
 an eminent american poet and prominent businessman certainly tracy s ppcli and mexican adventures are cited in it one looks 
 below the surface to learn more since the author seems to have had an intimate insight into richardson the man 
 and to some extent the keen thinker as well as doer richardson however was not lauded for his thoughts despite 
 the fact that there was always a tormented genius within him that never really emerged after seven years as a 
 pulp writer tracy again entered 0:enter 0:ed the service when japan attacked pearl harbour he was a senior staff officer 
 in colorado and the aleutians being discharged as a lieutenant colonel in january 1946 after several years of selling household 
 appliances door to door the only job he could get he died on april 20 1949 in virtual obscurity at 
 aged 59 years in a springfield missouri hospital his bones lie in the lake cemetery at lamar it is to 
 be hoped that his legend will not go unremembered footnote tracy richardson i working biblography alternate title for further reading

 by mcgill university with the award of an honourary degree of doctor of laws the citation is quoted below mr 
 chancellor i am pleased and honoured to present to you general james arthur de lalanne so that you may confer 
 on him the degree of doctor of laws honoris causa jimmy de lalanne is an extraordinary and remarkable 0:remark 0:able 
 canadian whereas it is not uncommon for a person 0:per 0:son to excel and achieve greatness in one field it 
 is rare in two and to excel in four is surely unique and yet that is exactly what jimmy de 
 lalanne has done in service to his country he achieved great distinction 0:distinc 0:tion by rising through the ranks from 
 private to general as a wartime soldier only from the mcgill university contingent of the officer training corps in 1915 
 he joined the princess patricia s canadian light infantry in france as a private he was commissioned in the field 
 in 1916 was wounded in action three times and was awarded the military cross and bar after the infamous 0:in 
 0:famous battle of vimy ridge he led the first patrol into the village of vimy to liberate it and at 
 the 50th anniversary celebration in 1967 the citizens of vimy recognized that important event by naming a street in his 
 honour 
 6 at the outbreak of the second world war jimmy de lalanne rejoined active service and served throughout 0:through 0:out 
 the war in staff positions primarily in ottawa reaching 0:reach 0:ing the rank of vice adjutant general by war s 
 end he received numerous decorations and medals including the title of commander of the order of the british empire and 
 the order of the white lion from the czechoslovak republic to say that since the end of the second world 
 war general de lalanne has not been on active service would perhaps be militarily correct but by any other measure 
 would be entirely wrong his service to his former comrades in arms continues unabated he has been a tireless worker 
 in aid of the royal canadian legion and since 1977 he has been the national grand president and as such 
 he participate in the remembrance 0:remem 0:brance day services at the cenotaph in ottawa yesterday 0:yester 0:day he is a 
 past president of the montreal united services 0:ser 0:vices institute the last post fund and the princess patricia s canadian 
 light infantry association of which he is currently vice patron he has been actively involved with the canadian corps of 
 commissionaires and has been chairman of the board of governors of the quebec division for the past seventeen years jimmy 
 de lalanne s service to the local community has been very broad in scope he is a former alderman 0:alder 
 0:man and mayor of the city of westmount a past president of the rotary club of westmount an officer of 
 the order of st john honorary vice president of the british commonwealth games association of canada and the montreal track 
 and field association a past president of the canadian rugby union and the quebec 0:que 0:bec amateur hockey association the 
 list goes on and on his connection with mcgill dates back to 1913 when at the age of sixteen he 
 entered the b a honours mathematics program on a scholarship his studies were interrupted by war but he returned afterwards 
 and graduated with a bachelor of arts degree in 1919 he maintained a close association with the university between the 
 wars and again after 1945 serving in many capacities especially in the graduates society of which he was president from 
 1950 to 52 he was also a member of the board of governors from 1953 to 56 and for ten 
 years was a member of the quebec council of education jimmy de lalanne s professional career was no less outstanding 
 after graduation in 1919 he joined the chartered accountancy firm of mcdonald currie and became a chartered accountant himself in 
 1923 placing first in quebec in the professional examinations as in all that he does he served his profession with 
 enthusiasm 0:enthusi 0:asm and distinction in 1952 he became president of the institute of chartered accountants of quebec and five 
 years later was elected president of the canadian institute in which capacity he represented the canadian 0:cana 0:dian profession around 
 the world the profession in quebec is celebrating its centenary this year and it is therefore most fitting that this 
 pre eminent member should be honoured by his alma mater as current president of the quebec order it is a 
 particular privilege and pleasure for me to present him to you such a brief resume of the accomplishments of jimmy 
 de lalanne cannot do justice but i am sure that it has at least given some indication of his ability 
 boundless energy and leadership qualities but what of the man anecdotes by him and about him abound and through those 
 it becomes very obvious that here is a man blessed with genuine respect and affection for his fellow man feelings 
 that are invariably reciprocated it is his devotion to service that impresses 0:impres 0:ses but it is his warm sense 
 of humour that endears his university his profession his community his country are proud of his achievements and the beneficiaries 
 0:bene 0:ficiaries of his great contributions it is in recognition of these that mcgill honours him today and i therefore 
 ask you mr chancellor in the name of senate to confer 0:con 0:fer upon james arthur de lalanne the degree 
 of doctor of laws honoris causa the twelfth day of november nineteen hundred and eighty alistair duff director of the

 10 adventure training a company taking to the damp cold and rock hard grounds of the sacree training area between 
 15 17 september 1980 preparing for battle was by no means a challenge to the red devils but a coy 
 s preparation for battle was to bear fruit as each platoon readied themselves for the defence of their own ground 
 during 22 24 september like gophers in the ground members of 2 platoon were the first to occupy its defensive 
 position anxiously 0:anx 0:iously and patiently waiting to successfully fend off the advancing enemy force as time ticked away the 
 killing ground to their front seemed to re vitalize its now brown shrubbery with more and more green specks of 
 life with his many years of battle experience 0:exper 0:ience sgt gerry boyle quickly pointed out to his platoon that 
 contrary to popular belief shrubs do not move enemy recce elements were without a doubt probing trying to draw fire 
 he said as the enemy platoon advanced the spray of metal was felt the whistle of death was heard and 
 the shrubbery again took its original brown colour as the enemy were cut down in their stride for ground and 
 a scramble for safety 0:safe 0:ty as artillery made its presence known simulated by c 4 explosive like wild stampeding 
 horses after a quick re organization the now bewildered aggressors surged forward in a violent but costly attempt to acquire 
 ground as the smoke screen cleared the smell of burnt gun powder cleared the air and the sounds of the 
 battle had turned into an awful gruesome sight all but one enemy soldier had been killed in action the survivor 
 0:sur 0:vivor pte smooch kiss was thoroughly searched given proper battlefield first aid and escorted to coy hq as a 
 pow miraculously 2 platoon had suffered but two casualties in the likes of mcpl billy lang and pte rob foster 
 who after being medically attended to by our company medic mcpl dave smith were actually evacuated 0:evac 0:uated to coy 
 hq some people will do anything to get out of the battle upon re organizing 2 platoon waited waited and 
 waited until all that could be seen was the white in each other s eyes as daylight slowly but surely 
 0:sure 0:ly retired for the day and handed over the watch to what was certainly going to be a long 
 cold and dark night 2 platoon waited for relief by 3 platoon s combat fresh warriors as the darkness and 
 the mystery of the night reluctantly 0:reluc 0:tantly gave in to the rear of the yawning sun with its arms 
 of light fully stretched out it gave a ray of hope and light to 3 platoon as they eagerly filled 
 the emptiness 0:empti 0:ness of those holes in the ground with their low wire entanglement still waiting to bite into 
 flesh and the ever present marked minefield covering their front sgt joe johansen with his claymore mine switch in hand 
 assured his eager troops that the enemy had but one way to come forward and then bang like all creatures 
 of habit again the enemy animalistically clung to the ground as they again clawed their way forward only to find 
 themselves bombarded by mortar and deadly artillery again simulated by c 4 explosives laid by the bn s pioneer platoon 
 aside from pte peter kulchyski who was overpowered by the gas attack and quickly given an atropine injection the damage 
 had been nil until the much awaited charge was given as the previous day s battle had gone it was 
 quickly done and over with with the pitter patter of clumsy combat boots the enemy withdrew leaving behind pte dave 
 thibodeau lying in pain with his chest gushing 0:gush 0:ing with blood as soldiers of 3 platoon affectionately known as 
 the root bears were to find out they had suffered heavy casualties among others their lar group had been wiped 
 out leaving pte peter plumtree with his stomach contents hanging out in plain sight for all to see and pte 
 bill thielen with a bayonet gash to his right arm always realistic in its company training 0:train 0:ing a company 
 had the medic bring out a gallon of blood and all his plastic wounds with him fixing up all casualties 
 into what turned out to be real sickening battlefield sight after re organization was complete gas masks taken off and 
 ready for war again all were quite aware of how much of a pain in the butt it was to 
 wear a gas mask rendering all speechless and unable to communicate with anyone further away than one s armreach gas 
 gas gas speaking of gas everyone thought it would be quite a gas to watch all of 1 platoon s 
 dirty dozen position themselves in their holes in the ground in order to surprise 0:sur 0:prise the enemy as they 
 finally overran the forward platoons on the third day being in depth with his almighty 0:al 0:mighty 12 wo charlie 
 hunt most certainly showed the offensive troops he really meant business with artillery 0:artil 0:lery rounds strewing metal dirt and 
 bodies into the air the almighty 12 littered their front with bodies as they chopped the enemy down in multitudes 
 aside from pte karry murray s injured right hand and pte animal davis getting shell shocked by all the artillery 
 rounds as he blazed away with his general purpose machine gun they had fared well after pte gonzo buchanan expertly 
 patched them up and sent them off to company 0:com 0:pany hq the war was over and believe it or 
 not war is really hell as the enemy learned as they were totally wiped out by the victorious 1 platoon

 11 b company c company during the period 8 12 sep 80 b coy 1 ppcli used shuswap lake bc 
 as its adventure training area a brutal and draining experience the week long trial was characterized by long periods of 
 stalking the wily suntan 0:sun 0:tan some of b coy s more experienced warriors could hold a position for hours 
 without moving a muscle broken up by short periods of intense eating and sleeping unlike the normal exercise weather bravo 
 was forced to endure sunshine light breezes and starry nights wildlife and fish were dense in the area after an 
 hour long vicious no holds barred battle in the stream below albas falls the csm landed 6 inches of prime 
 eating trout the record catch for the trip the coy clk crawled out of his hooch early one dawn and 
 shaved himself three times before realizing he was staring into a bear b coy started each day with a run 
 and ended it around a bonfire on the beach each night those brave enough to go swimming sang soprano for 
 the rest of the trip which was finished off with the bi annual one and a half mile run the 
 equipment gave its usual faultless 0:fault 0:less performance as canteen cups were great for bailing 0:bail 0:ing and lore had 
 the deuce engine replaced in no time at all the only casualties suffered by bravo s fearless fighters were overdoses 
 of the old ultra violet b coy extended their thanks to lt beauchamp for excellent planning and timing as the 
 rain did not find us until we were halfway back to calgary during the five days on the lake b 
 coy got a close look at their new oc and csm and vice versa the officers and men performed tasks 
 as a company and as platoons thus achieving the main objective of familiarization within the company the process was thoroughly 
 enjoyed by all b coy on ex royal conoert the first week of the adventure training we were based in 
 a base camp with all the amenities of home such as cold and cold running water only a short ten 
 paces from the front door of your tent we started the week off with a day of rock climbing and 
 rapelling it was at the rock climbing that such notable climbers as quick grip merredew sure hands cole and combat 
 clerk fabi proved that the only secret to rock climbing is to ensure you have a firm grip although at 
 times there seemed a definite pause by these staunch mountaineers as to whether or not they would ever let go 
 of that grip meanwhile over at the rapel site just about everyone was getting into the swing of things pte 
 break a leg peters excelled at the aussie rapel clocking the fastest descent unfortunately that is also how he got 
 his nickname the illustrious green machine started the red deer trip early monday morning and with great anticipation we boarded 
 the bus and we were off to the river everything was going according to plan it s just that we 
 couldn t find the joffre bridge or the red deer river but thanks to lt klie and a few civic 
 passers by we managed to get there our first night was spent in a little road side park and there 
 was some discrepancy about the distance we had paddled so we asked the local people who ran the nearby store 
 needless to say there was quite a difference from what we were told must have been a few bends created 
 in the river since the map was printed at least that s what the platoon commander said on the second 
 day pte fall out of your boat horton decided to do a 10 100 in midstream but panicked when he 
 saw some fast water ahead not surprisingly he got to test his lifejacket in field conditions our home made version 
 of a sailboat was one of the most relaxing ideas for the canoe trip except when there was no wind 
 thanks to t w alias wo smith gizzy sgt hill and fat man ralph for supplying us with the occasional 
 beer we had all longed to have just ask pte teatotler edwards how good it was after the last strenuous

 12 courses driver wheel course 8101 invades beautiful bc it took a few hours and a couple of last minute 
 beer purchases but we finally managed to say good bye to cfb calgary last monday as we drove off in 
 a gaggle pack for elko bc before going on a bit of background must be given on the driver s 
 course a lot of time had been given to the course by both candidates and instructors time on how to 
 slide down hills as mcpl wiener laidley can attest to along with pte robbie robicheau time on how not to 
 drive in the city and time on how not to use a gear shift by 23 march however 0:how 0:ever 
 all kinks had been ironed out and the trip was designed to sharpen the already expert skills of the candidates 
 it started off fine we made it out of calgary but then the fun began gears grinding and engines screaming 
 pte robicheau and yep wiener took on a telephone pole and a semi loaded with logs at the same time 
 then in elko sgt filpula got very tired at driver wheel course 8101 a pub then again not too many 
 instructors looked too healthy the next morning ah but the candidates came to the rescue pte shannon gave the to 
 a fine lesson in how to take out car doors at 9 00 in the morning one of the jeeps 
 got stuck in a river while the guys were fishing the civics thought this sort of stuff was great and 
 kept waving their fists and fingers in salutation as they whipped by and then our favorite candidate robicheau parked a 
 2 1 2 ton got out and watched it roll down a hill just so that he could honestly say 
 that no one could outdo him ah but we forget the little points like cpl cow l ll crunch em 
 kelly who does not like litter on the roads so he made sure that he flattened a jerry can that 
 had fallen off another truck pte vanderwerf took on two semis in a chicken race and actually won poor old 
 wiener his excuse is that he is one of the three menopause rangers in 1 ppcli mcpl mickey berridge is 
 another but he did do his good deed of the century wrong he s only 40 by feeding his good 
 buddy some unknown civy on the highway this guy was so happy he cried mikey wouldn t give him his 
 beer that s good pr mikey keep it up you realize of course that we are only in trail now 
 all the vehicles have hit at least two semis three parked cars and have been over the cliff at least 
 once the instructors have each been killed twice which does bring me to a dilemma everyone knows that no one 
 really likes officers but seriously if you are going to take him out don t take the vehicle yourself and 
 two others with him pte budniw definitely failed this po as the white freightliner hit the jeep with the to 
 and who else but robicheau in it we re off to vernon and mcpl burke supposedly one of the new 
 recruits of the menopause types actually moved a mountain with a five quarter pu he doesn t admit it but 
 he was the one driving congrats were given to ptes foster and harley for volunteering to work in the kitchen 
 forever after they went on their recce and pte edwards had his question answered 0:answer 0:ed if you are driving 
 yes i will wear my seat belt our medic got in on the act finally after he drove through penticton 
 and picked up a set of whitewalls by rubbing his wheels against the curb for five miles we must mention 
 that little pte anderson has forced the unit to put a ucr on three ton stakes either that or we 
 must put blocks on the pedals so that the passengers will be able to put their feet on the floor 
 and stop kissing the windshield vernon was fun and costly the exploits and accomplishments of everyone concerned made the people 
 quite happy good riddance we are almost home now but we still had a bit of backing up to do 
 the students finally figured out their army left and right after much contemplation and practice the instructors however now have 
 serious doubts about which way is left or right the final leg was done in total darkness soothing comments such 
 as if you drive over the cliff you ll be dead before we hit the bottom because i ll break 
 your neck first echoed across the mountains we made a few more friends with the civics with our high beams 
 always on the city of calgary got a premature awakening by listening to the grinding of gears and screaming tires 
 we finally made it and the crowbars were taken out to pry the instructors fingers off the sissy bar a 
 beer or two awaited us at 0800 and that was it driver wheel course 8002

 and around keller hall the building 0:build 0:ing trembled as nineteen bodies smashed simultaneously 0:simultan 0:eously to the floor behind 
 their weapons the hoarse snarls of the instructors resounded through the halls and the occasional civilian driver probably had fellings 
 of insecurity when the gunners moved outside for their lesson on engaging moving targets however no complaints were received corporal 
 gimp atkinson re discovered one of the anti personnel capabilities of the hmg when he dropped a barrel on his 
 foot after four weeks of practise and theory the course packed weapons equipment trigger happy gunners and beaucoup bullets for 
 the move to wainwright and the live fire portion of the course the first night in camp the gunners suited 
 actions to words and charged off to engage the town of wainwright minor casualties only were reported due to the 
 fact that pte letters pilkey got a little bottled up during the following days the gunners fired on targets small 
 large hard soft moving and even targets they couldn t see targets were engaged with weapons on ground mounts a 
 a mounts mounted in grizzly turrets and plain old firing from the hip during the a a shoot pte foxton 
 was credited with a direct hit on a paraflare all the training must have sunk in when students were given 
 paraflares to light up a night shoot they immediately tried to use them as direct fire weapons and one gunner 
 used his deadly and accurate mmg to blow the mirror off his grizzly targets collected at the end of the 
 range practise indicated the effectiveness of the fire with some figure 11 s showing literally hundreds of holes now confident 
 of their ability to employ these long range meat grinders the gunners cleaned up toasted their new skills excessively and

 32 with the christmas stand down completed the second battalion was prepared to tackle their winter exercise exercise rapier thrust 
 81 was designed to practise the battalion in winter operations the unit conducted a highly aggressive defence that used deception 
 concealment movement and radio silence to entrap the enemy force trying to reconnoitre and break through our position deception meant 
 digging two positions per company one as an alternate and one that would be occupied once the enemy thrust was 
 identified in many cases patrolling was one of two ways a soldier could enjoy a break from digging the only 
 other way was an enemy attack radio silence made working efficiently more difficult but minimizing communications and using runners between 
 0:be 0:tween sub units ensured that the security of the battalion was maintained the enemy was never totally aware of 
 the company positions to assist our communications 0:com 0:munications miles of land line were laid by the signals platoon line 
 crew during the four day exercise the line crews rigorous activities included laying and lifting over fifty miles of wire

 course successfully underway due to a lack of training publications but despite this early hiccup drivers course 8101 was into 
 high gear by mid february 0:mid 0:feb 0:ruary during the initial phase of training the tempo of activity was fast 
 with the students driving around the streets of winnipeg and absorbing the intricacies 0:intri 0:cacies of the internal combustion engine 
 by day and doing practical maintenance by night the course moved to cfb shilo where driving exercise snowy owl was 
 conducted which provided a chance to see what the wheeled vehicles could do in the hinterlands of shilo the training 
 was challenging 0:chal 0:lenging and the addition of a company of american soldiers added considerable interest to a successful course 
 eighteen students graduated and cpl moran earned the position of top student c driver track course this year s driver 
 track course was conducted at winnipeg and fort carson colorado the first four weeks were held at ka pyong barracks 
 during this phase of training the 48 students covered basic theory and some city driving it has been quite some 
 time since a track course was conducted around a metropolitan city such as winnipeg everyone including the instructors found th 
 s to be a valuable and interesting approach to training the remainder of the time in winnipeg was spent in 
 completing the theory portion of the course before the students started serious training in tactical 0:tac 0:tical driving at fort 
 carson in addition to participating 0:partici 0:pating in the driver track course all members were part of the small unit 
 exchange with the 1 11 infantry 4 infantry mechanized division at fort carson colorado all the tactical driving was conducted 
 0:con 0:ducted there in a semi arid environment with some very rugged terrain approximately one mile above sea level this 
 situation exposed the students to new variables when driving the driver track course accomplished its aims it graduated 48 well 
 qualified drivers and all members of the course learned a great deal as well as having fun in the process

 role each platoon and section now has its own integral fire support in the form of direct fire automatic weapons 
 thus it was inevitable that this year s machine gun course was a large one attempting to train enough soldiers 
 to man the guns on their own section or detachment vehicle with the usual high standard of professionalism 0:profession 0:alism 
 demonstrated by the instructors 33 candidates 0:can 0:didates graduated after completing the theory and tsoet s in kapyong barracks the

 techniques of fire control a significant quantity of ammunition was expended which combined with hot dry weather conditions improved the

 58 ppcli band all too quickly it seems another year has come and gone it was a busy year for 
 the ppcli band one in which some personnel changes took place the band travelled extensively and was involved in a 
 wide variety of engagements both in canada and south of the border captain ron swaneveld cd took command of the 
 band in the summer of 1980 he replaced major jean francis pierret cd who retired after many years in the 
 canadian forces band system under the direction of captain swaneveld many changes have been introduced 0:intro 0:duced into the band 
 s program the band now has an exciting new sound and format in concert incorporating 0:incor 0:porating aspects of a 
 stage band a concert band and a show band more changes are yet to come our assistant director of music 
 cwo rh john french came to the band in 1979 as our acting chief we were very happy to see 
 john finally receive his long awaited promotion to cwo this past winter as was previously mentioned the band spent a 
 lot of time travelling during the last year concert tours and recruiting tours have taken us to many parts of 
 alberta and beyond within alberta we carried the ppcli name to places such as medicine hat lethbridge 0:leth 0:bridge red 
 deer ponoka westaskiwin barrhead drayton valley canmore brooks and edmonton to mention a few out of province we performed last 
 september for a week at malmstrom air force base in great falls montana in july of this year the band 
 went to kimberly 0:kimber 0:ly bc to play a series of concerts and march in the annual july first parade 
 we were very well received there by all who heard us and are looking forward to a return trip naturally 
 we took part in our share of parades and other military functions over the year the highlight of these was 
 the trooping of the colour on 8 may with 1 ppcli this event was significant because our colonel in chief 
 lady patricia was the reviewing officer after many long hours and days of rehearsal the big day finally arrived unfortunately 
 the weather did not co operate in pouring rain and almost freezing weather the trooping went on as scheduled that 
 aside lady patricia was very pleased with the sharpness 0:sharp 0:ness and drill of all the participants right on the 
 heels of the trooping the band flew to victoria for a freedom of the city parade and a minitattoo 0:mini 
 0:tattoo after a series of quick rehearsals the tattoo was performed before a very appreciative audience on victoria day due 
 to the format of the tattoo which included six bands 3rd battalion ppcli and many support units a lot of 
 us were reminded of the centennial 0:cen 0:tennial tattoo which toured canada in 1967 this one was not as big 
 but was still very impressive the coming year looks as though it will be even busier than the past we 
 are anticipating a wide variety of engagements throughout alberta and western canada

 60 2 airborne commando cyprus petawawa the commandos normal activities over the last year have taken a drastic change for 
 the first time since the 1974 conflict we are keeping the peace in cyprus we tried however to fit a 
 full training year into the last five months before our departure in march the commando has undergone a number of 
 changes in the past couple of years and many of the ex jumpers who served with the commando in the 
 past will be surprised to learn that the airborne regiment has been re organized into three commandos each being regimentally 
 0:regi 0:mentally manned the consequence of this is that 2 commando is now almost completely composed of patricias there is 
 a feeling among many of the older airborne troopers here that we have lost something special by this re organization 
 but this certainly hasn t shown in the field not all patricias here in the regiment are in 2 com 
 mando as there are still a large number scattered about in regimental headquarters and in the service commando the head 
 patricia is still the regimental commander colonel dick cowling others in rhq included major ray crabbe now lcol and co 
 1 ppcli major dave stevenson recently promoted to that rank and now about to leave us for places unknown capt 
 ray romses now on exchange with the para regt capt barry lewis capt mike morneault and capt ross mclaughlin as 
 a result of our deployment to cyprus the commando 0:com 0:mando has remained very stable in structure with the exception 
 of the co major ed peterson has packed his parachute and moved to rss winnipeg handing over to major bill

 slaughter ed several times over by the former the exercise was most memorable however because of a 24 hour weather 
 delay which allowed us to watch oakland win the superbowl upon return to petawawa by 707 through trenton we re 
 configured to our cyprus orbat and most of us managed to get away on two or three weeks leave rear 
 party went on to ft bragg on exercise with 3 commando and from there to victoria bc for a little 
 less demanding training on 19 march we all packed our kit bags and headed off towards the rising sun and

 leaving trenton at of at 0400 hours in the morning in jungle boots lightweight pants tee shirt smocks and maroon 
 berets was quite an experience it was worth every second of it when we got off the plane at raf 
 akrotiri and saw the customs un and raf officials 0:of 0:ficials faces a quick change of headgear and there we 
 were the commando instantly became a sports legacy winning every regimental competition and trophy and placing first in every inter 
 unit sport we became so much of a powerhouse that the other units took to calling us sports commando and 
 claiming that we didn t even man the line so what if we left the line unmanned in order to

 72 canadian forces recruit school course 8024 8006 a young officer has very few opportunities today to have a platoon 
 for any lenght of time and in garrison platoon commanders and section commanders rarely have a chance to know the 
 men that work for them an opportunity which is available and which is not fully appreciated is the opportunity tha 
 a platoon commander 0:com 0:mander has to go to cfrs cornwallis and take a recruit platoon through its basic training 
 after which the infantry portion of the cornwallis platoon goes with the platoon commander to camp wainwright to complete its 
 tq3 training this then is the story of one such platoon 13 june 1980 the bus leaves cfb cornwallis at 
 2200 hours to meet the midnight crawler which arrives in cfb greenwood every friday night aboard this plane are recruits 
 from all acorss canada these are very special recruits because they will form course 8024 this course will commence with 
 130 recruits representing all trades when the plane arrives in cfb greenwood it is met by two master corporals from 
 the course the recruits look lost and very civilian most have hair down to their shoulders and are wearing blue 
 jeans and t shirts most of all they look tired and very much alone 16 june 1980 course 8024 is 
 starting a little of the inclearance was done sunday but this first week has been set aside to complete the 
 preliminary administration 0:admini 0:stration required for each individual today with primary 0:pri 0:mary needles and a haircut as they are 
 marched over to needles parade one of the master corporals comments on the work that lies ahead at needles parade 
 one cannot help but notice the untoned muscles the pale skin and the fact that quite a few are fainting 
 some even before they get their needle after needles parade they are marched over to the barber who has four 
 chairs it reminds me of scenes from many a hollywood movie 18 june 1980 today all of their civy clothes 
 are taken away and placed in the civy lockup they will not be allowed to wear them again until graduation 
 in 10 1 2 weeks time 19 june 1980 this morning the recruits formed up in workdress looking for the 
 first time as though there might be hope as 8 platoon course 8024 progressed it proved it had spirit it 
 won the sports trophy and the cto s penant in week 6 in weeks 7 and 8 it was runner 
 up for the cto s pennant second only to 13 platoon which was a female platoon since the cto s 
 pennant is given to the platoon which has the cleanest quarters we knew in our hearts that it was heredity

 must say that it isn t quite the way i remembered 0:remem 0:bered it i keep waiting for someone to

 73 10 december 1980 we are called in from the field to attend the men s christmas dinner this not 
 only affords the usual delights but is enhanced by the fact that we have been on hard rations for three 
 weeks 18 december 1980 permission is received for amiens to graduate a day early to enable the men to get 
 down to battalion find rooms and leave for christmas 0:christ 0:mas the graduation parade is reviewed by major ligget oc

 our regular support staff are patricia s and will be known to many of you one development over the year 
 which we hope portends 0:por 0:tends well for the future was the arrival of four junior officers a rare species 
 in recent years at the unit at the start of the training year in september 2lt w joanne bourque came 
 to us from the royal new brunswick 0:bruns 0:wick regiment and began putting her logistics training to good use over 
 the year three young men without prior military experience joined us and by the end of summer training this past 
 august 2lt richard weizenbach 0:weizen 0:bach and ocdts paul bury and david gilmour had completed their initial officer qualifying courses 
 and were preparing to take on their first unit appointments the adjutant celebrated this influx of fresh talent by purchasing 
 a colourful new orderly officer badge structure many of you may wonder just what a militia infantry battalion is made 
 up of our current establishment provides 0:pro 0:vides for a battalion headquarters and two rifle companies each of two platoons 
 the total authorized strength is 154 all ranks there is also provision for a thirty six member band sadly we 
 are very much under strength running somewhere just over forty percent of the establishment 0:establish 0:ment figure we are not 
 alone in this undiserable state of affairs such a level is common amongst prairie militia units even our band is 
 few in numbers and exists as a musical entity only as part of a joint band with 418 air reserve 
 squadron s band against this background it may seem strange that there is a good possibility that our authorized establishment 
 0:establish 0:ment will be increased as part of a re structuring of militia units this is so however and we 
 are hoping that other developments now underway in the training sphere will gradually increase our strength to a point where 
 higher establishment levels will be justified training what s going on then as it happens we have just embarked upon 
 a complete revamping of our training programme as part of an overall change throughout militia area prairie our current tasking 
 within the framework of mobile command is to provide trained personnel to augment 1 ppcli in the event of a 
 national mobilization to this end the emphasis in unit training has been on the individual skills required of an infantry 
 soldier as well as section and platoon tactics we have not been involved 0:in 0:volved in training recruits something that 
 has been handled centrally through a training company controlled 0:control 0:led through district hq though admittedly staffed largely by our 
 ncos to accomplish our training aim we have worked around a september to june training cycle parading every wednesday night 
 and saturday during this training 0:train 0:ing year we have been averaging about one weekend long exercise every month at 
 either camp wainwright or a couple of smaller training areas available near edmonton these exercises involve range work on all 
 infantry weapons practising tactical skills and winter warfare training during the summer unit members have taken trade and promotion courses 
 at various militia training centres across the country and have participated in a one week militia concentration at mtc dundurn 
 saskatchewan this year s milcon 81 again involved training along corps lines so that our members had the chance to 
 polish their skills alongside fellow prairie militia infantrymen new training scheme all this now changes as the commander of militia 
 area prairie has decided to implement a system which was developed in secteur de i est and has been running 
 0:run 0:ning successfully for several years amongst quebec militia units the training year will now begin in january and for 
 the first two months the entire unit will concentrate its efforts on recruiting the idea is that any young person 
 wishing summer employment with the militia must join at this time and commence his recruit and basic training around march 
 from then until the summer 0:sum 0:mer the unit s sole activity will be conducting this training unit members who 
 are not required as training staff and only such members will have the opportunity to take advanced trade and promotion 
 courses from a new entity the district battle school the summer will see further training of this sort but the 
 intention is that the continuation of training for the new members 0:mem 0:bers will be conducted locally rather than at 
 mtc dundurn the summer training will end in time to allow all unit members to participate in milcon which will 
 have been shifted back to the middle of august it is also possible that milcon will revert back to being 
 run on a district basis rather than as a single concentration 0:concen 0:tration for the entire area after a short 
 break at the end of the summer the unit will spend the remaining four months of the year on collective 
 training at the section platoon and even company level the announcement of this new system came during this summer s 
 miclon 81 and most unit members did not learn of it until returning in september the general 
 75 reaction has been positive as we are anxious to try out this system which holds a reasonable promise of 
 increasing 0:in 0:creasing unit strength while at the same time upgrading 0:upgrad 0:ing the calibre of individual training we are 
 presently in a four month transition period during which all training tasks required in the old 1981 82 training year 
 are being hastily accomplished while planning gets underway for bringing in the new system we are using this transition period 
 to experiment 0:ex 0:periment with another arrangement which we hope will improve attendance and increase unit cohesion this involves changing 
 from parading every saturday to a weekend on one off system whereby we show up on saturday and sunday one 
 weekend then stand down the next provided cfb edmonton continues to co operate we are even trying out the idea 
 of putting our troops up in quarters at griesbach over the weekends 0:week 0:ends we are parading although the total 
 amount of training time remains the same by re arranging it in this fashion we hope to ameliorate one of 
 the problems which we know cuts attendance militia activity blots up a lot of one s spare time and by 
 parading every saturday it is difficult to attend to the various personal and household chores that are best accomplished on 
 that day of the week then too we feel that more will be accomplished where we can run two days 
 of training in succession if the new system works out we will consider retaining it once the new training scheme 
 comes into effect next january equipment our task in support of 1 ppcli has been revised slightly by converting us 
 to a mechanized role the reality of this comes in the form of the avgp grizzly which is to be 
 issued to us although we now have several drivers trained to date the grizzly remains for us a large and 
 mythological beast since our four have not shown up rumours persist of railway freight handlers 0:hand 0:lers seeing the 4 
 ppcli stencil and stopping the shipment 0:ship 0:ment at winnipeg or diverting it to calgary or sending it on to 
 victoria chuck marshall in civil life a freight services agent for a railway firm whose founder has an armoured regiment 
 named after him blames his rivals in another national railway when the grizzlies do arrive we ll be putting three

 been very eventful for the cadet corps from the regular tuesday parade nights to weekend exercises the cadets have studied 
 and worked hard towards the achievement of their star program badges the corps rifle team continued last year to prove 
 that their team was second to none in all army cadet rifle competitions in the region of manitoba and northwestern

 80 the royal green jackets ist battalion bessbrook we write from bessbrook in late may our tour has been over 
 shadowed by the murder on tuesday 19 may of four green jackets and one rct driver the four green jackets 
 killed were lcpl winstone rfn bagshaw rfn gavin and rfn king we grieve for them and for their families we 
 returned from christmas leave on january 2nd and ten days later were all down at cpta doing our northern ireland 
 training remarkably for january the weather was good and much valuable training in the villages on the ranges and in 
 the hills behind hythe was carried out our northern ireland training was completed with a week in stanford in february 
 we left for south armagh in early march in good shape and looking forward to a tour in an area 
 that many of us knew from 1974 not much has changed the bases are a bit more extensive amenities have 
 improved out of the bases the ruc work much harder and are much more in control the way ahead has 
 worked but having said that it is still the same campaign and still the individual skills that count our tour 
 has been eventful apart from the incident mentioned above there have been a mortar attack on newtonhamilton from which we 
 escaped with only minor casualties a gun battle on the border in which two terrorists were captured one by us 
 and one by the garda and a series of shooting incidents the border gun battle was particularly successful because we 
 captured gunmen moving north and certainly prevented an incident of some sort together with ensuring that two gunmen will be 
 locked away for a long time csgt barrett commanded the ambush the mortar attack was notable for the way a 
 platoon survived a heavy attack on it at 2100 hours and presented a face to the outside world at 0700 
 hours the following morning as if nothing had happened 0:hap 0:pened much work was done that night to re build 
 the exterior of the base and so the tour continues at the end of july we leave south armagh for 
 hounslow we take a month s leave and then start to sort ourselves out for the return 0:re 0:turn to 
 northern ireland in november we are all wondering which of our companies will be the first to find themselves in 
 support of the south armagh battalion we look forward to the rest of our tour here and then to our 
 return to aldergrove in november 2nd battalion minden we returned to work on 4 jan after a generous baor stand 
 down period of two weeks justified by the moratorium january was a platoon level training period during which rifle platoons 
 braved the blizzards 0:bliz 0:zards of soltau to do some low level training in february we completed some more platoon 
 training followed by combat team training during which we were joined by three troops of lifeguards in chieftains since february 
 we have taken part in various baor cpxs won the divisional bisley selection meeting and hosted 60 acf cadets among 
 the latter 25 buckinghamshire 0:buck 0:inghamshire cadets wearing green jacket berets our mortar and milan platoons attended their respective concentrations 
 in june and battlegroup training took place at soltau from 1 12 june all elements of the battle group were 
 there this was the first and will be the last until june 1982 time that we have all exercised together 
 the hockey team did well in the divisional league and the football and rugby teams acquitted themselves 0:them 0:selves well 
 the big success has been the re establishment 0:re 0:establish 0:ment of the battalion boxing team we have had a 
 novices competition and two friendly matches to date we hope to enter the baor championships in 1982 we provided the 
 majority of the green jacket nominations for the hut at steibis and some 100 students attended a skiing course there 
 from 2 rgj the hut and courses were brilliantly run by eddie bright summer courses canoeing climbing windsurfing 0:wind 0:surfing 
 hill walking are continuing july sees us at sennelager for our apwt and field firing and we start our northern 
 ireland training in september our next report will be from belfast 3rd battalion cambridge the first half of our year 
 started with two months of cadres and internal training once the cadres were over the bn reorganized itself with intensive 
 company training 0:train 0:ing in the by now very familiar stanford training area at the end of march the bn 
 then dissolved to re emerge as the uklf cadet leadership course directing staff and associated personnel with the addition of 
 almost 50 outside instructors under the direction of major jamie daniell the course lasted for two weeks in the middle 
 of april and catered for 300 very enthusiastic 
 81 16 18 year old cadets after a very busy time on motorcycles 0:motor 0:cycles assault courses watermanship and three 
 exercises 0:exer 0:cises including everything from helicopters to hercules resupply the cadets went home happy and the bn went on 
 leave for ten days to recover since leave there have been busy preparations for spearhead and the bn exercise on 
 1 5 june despite being placed on 24 hours notice to move and the ominous arrival of an is pack 
 which caused some excitement we have not yet been involved in travel abroad we are all looking forward to a 
 quiet spearhead 0:spear 0:head tour in mid june july after that we look forward 0:for 0:ward to three weeks leave 
 and a trip to cyprus in october november on exercise moonbase v on the sporting side the football team has 
 had some good results winning the district challenge cup and being runner up in the local league russel cup the 
 hockey team reached the final of the infantry cup having won the eastern district championship we have again held a

 be remembered as the year of the financial cuts in the ta our ration of fuel ammunition and worst of 
 all man training days the ta soldiers pay have all been reduced however it is still business as usual in 
 4 rgj and we have already had a packed and successful year despite the cuts recruiting has never been better 
 and the battalion is only a few men short of the establishment figure of 747 training recruits has been one 
 of our most pressing problems and we are particularly 0:particu 0:larly grateful to the rifle depot for the recruit courses 
 they have run for us and also to 3 rgj who provided us with facilities to run a special recruit 
 course at oakington in mar 81 without which we would still have a large backlog of untrained recruits on the 
 training side one of the highlights was when approximately 100 riflemen visited hythe for one of that legendary ex rifleman 
 and training guru douggie maber s famous mneumonic range packages this one called centurion cptts s efforts negate territorials understandable 
 reluctance in offering numbers this enabled us to use some of the more interesting ranges which the ta don t 
 normally have a chance to get near such as the urban cqb and marksmanship under fire range the anti tank 
 platoon also did the david package mentioned by 2 rgj in the last newsletter the platoon has now done its 
 milan conversion course and we await the issue of the missle equipment in dec 81 on the shooting front we 
 came second in the 1981 london district ta saam bunhill lodge is now undergoing 0:under 0:going an extensive face lift 
 and our new shooting team are becoming almost permanent squatters there and we have every intention of maintaining a long 
 term effort to get back into the forefront of ta competition shooting battalion headquarters spent a pleasant week in may 
 on ex hurst park an enormous baor command post exercise where they relearnt that well known lesson that the chinagraph 
 pencil is mightier than the sword we have had a string of successes in the sporting field we came second

 participating 0:partici 0:pating in a number of major formation exercises in diverse locations throughout australia in addition the development of 
 mechanized and airborne skills continued 0:con 0:tinued and two battalions were used to form the basis of the operational deployment 
 force raised to meet defence emergencies on the personnel side the officers holding the two senior regimental appointments colonel commandant 
 0:command 0:ant and regimental colonel completed their terms during 1981 the new colonel commandant is general sir arthur macdonald kbe

 keeping with the format used last year to report the regiment s activities selected battalion reports are provided in addition 
 a brief history and outline of activities of depot company the unit responsible for training soldiers prior to their allocation 
 to the battalions 0:bat 0:talions is included depot company history a rar depot was raised on 18 january 1952 and 
 renamed 4rar on 10 march 1952 as a training unit on a special establishment on the order of battle this 
 renaming was necessary because government approval had been given to raise a battalion and not a depot the prime function 
 of 4rar at the time was to train and hold infantrymen for service in korea later on 24 march 1960 
 the unit was incorporated with the school of infantry as depot company the royal australian regiment the whole forming the 
 infantry centre training depot company of the royal australian regiment is responsible for the initial employment training let of all 
 regular army soldiers allotted to the royal australian infantry corps to conduct this training the company has sufficient staff for 
 six platoons based on one lieutenant one sergeant and four corporals per platoon the average number of trainees in each 
 platoon is 50 during 1980 the company trained more than 700 soldiers for the regiment training time is eleven weeks 
 54 days and a task inventory approved by headquarters training command 0:com 0:mand is the basis for the detailed syllabus 
 during this time the training programme concentrates on teaching a skill and immediately using that skill before soldiers forget for 
 example a on thursday of week 3 soldiers are taught the characteristics 0:char 0:acteristics etc of the m 203 grenade 
 launcher and revised on the m3o m26 grenade and b on friday of week 3 soldiers fire the m 203

 standard in some subjects 0:sub 0:jects soldiers have been taught basics and many more periods of teaching revision are required 
 within units to achieve a high skill level weaker points generally include a map reading navigation soldiers are taught the 
 basics at the ist recruit training battalion but still experience difficulty here b communications radio procedure soldiers need more practice 
 to overcome mistakes made because of nervousness c some soldiers have difficulty achieving basic rifle shooting standards and keeping fit 
 these are a definite minority but where these weaknesses are noted on course reports supervision is required comprehensive reports are 
 written about each soldier when he completes let training one copy is forwarded to his unit on his personal file 
 and that report lists apparent strengths and weaknesses recent comments from battalions indicate that the soldiers arriving at units have 
 attained an acceptable standard and are fitting into rifle sections well

 task force a requirement of the unit as part of this force is the ability to operate on light scales 
 that is the ability to be deployed and completely maintained by medium range transport aircraft since january 1981 2 4 
 rar has been the primary unit in the odf battalion 0:bat 0:talion group which has necessitated added emphasis on the 
 administrative requirements to ensure members are ready for deployment at short notice the training of the battalion has been varied 
 over the last twelve months exercise king cobra held in september 1980 was a company test exercise based on a 
 collective training assessment system it was designed to test sub units in all phases of war in a conventional setting 
 at battalion level the exercise was conducted in the hidden valley area north of townsville queensland companies were rotated through 
 a five day exercise with all following the same sequence of events the exercise established a firm base for planning 
 the unit training over the following year on completion of exercise king cobra the battalion 0:bat 0:talion commenced a period 
 of unit courses to train specialists for mortar signal pioneer transport and machine gun platoons the courses were conducted 0:con 
 0:ducted throughout october and early november 1980 and were successful in ensuring the battalion has a pool of specialists from 
 which to draw the unit followed these courses with a series of survival exercises in different settings the aim of 
 these exercises was to provide a change from normal training and improve the soldiers understanding of the type of country 
 in which they operate since january 1981 the unit has been involved in sub unit training leading up to a 
 battalion exercise exercise fractured falcon which was conducted in may 1981 the companies have been involved in a series of 
 exercises in both open and close country the exercises have been conducted to the north and west of townsville and 
 have involved patrolling mechanized operations advance and attack as well as insertion by utility helicopters and short range air transport 
 the major activity so far in 1981 has been the battalion 0:bat 0:talion exercise held at clarke river 100 km 
 west of townsville exercise fractured falcon the exercise involved deployment by air to clarke river to protect civilians from harrassment 
 by a low level insurgent force the exercise was a change in that it was designed 0:de 0:signed to practice 
 the unit in protection of key facilities and infrastructure and to react quickly for deployment as new threats to other 
 areas were detected although basically a defensive type of exercise a series of redeployments 0:re 0:deployments exercised all sections of 
 the unit in routine movement procedures as well as normal unit training b company were involved in a three month 
 detachment to the air base butterworth malaysia over the christmas period as well as providing security to the base the 
 company was involved in training in close country and live firing exercises the detachment was also an opportunity to indulge 
 in sightseeing and duty free shopping sprees since b company have returned from malaysia a company have also caught the 
 travelling bug and spent april in hawaii as part of an exchange pro gramme with the us army 2 4 
 rar hosted a company of us army infantry for the same period as well as the normal training activities many 
 of our guests were able to see parts of the great barrier reef off the east coast of queensland probably 
 the most famous tourist attraction in the country overall the last twelve months have seen a variety of training activities 
 and visits the battalion looks forward to the remainder of the year with a series of exercises culminating in our 
 major joint services exercise exercise kangaroo 81 3rar since august of 1980 the last ten months have been demanding but 
 eventful for 3rar the unit has taken part in various exercises from company to divisional level it has provided support 
 for other regular army unit exercises and army reserve exercises and it has sent personnel on promotion courses and conducted 
 its own internal promotion courses the initial months of 1981 have also seen the development of plans for 3rars relocation 
 to sydney also a directive has been issued that 3rar become airborne and parachute qualified and the unit has reacted 
 by sending over 100 soldiers comprising all ranks on parachute specialist training until 1982 but in the meantime 1981 will 
 be devoted to the battalion developing an air mobile air portable capability the latter part of 1980 saw 3rar being 
 involved in a battalion exercise in the arid regions of south australia exercise flinders chase conducted near hawker approximately 500 
 km north of adelaide was a warm up for the divisional exercise to be conducted in october flinders chase was 
 a ten day exercise which concentrated on the advance and attack phases of war and was designed to achieve rapid 
 foot mobility practice companies in operating as a larger force and practice procedures for occupying hasty defence positions which could 
 be developed into more deliberate positions the training was physically and mentally demanding on all members of the battalion with 
 everyone battling intense heat torrents of flies and the elusive enemy the strenuous nature of the exercise stood 3rar in 
 good stead for its participation in exercise drought master the divisional exercise conducted in october this exercise was the largest 
 peacetime exercise of its kind conducted in australia since world war ii and was beneficial for battalion training at higher 
 levels the exercise was conducted out the back of bourke approximately 800 km north west of sydney operations 0:opera 0:tions 
 concentrated on the quick advance and attack with units advancing along a common axis of 150 km over a period 
 of 12 days again conditions were exceedingly 0:ex 0:ceedingly uncomfortable and the flies just as irritating as 3rar practiced its 
 units and sub units the exercise 0:exer 0:cise was a successful one for 3rar and its achievement 0:achieve 0:ment of 
 advancing by foot over a distance of 37 km along the divisional axis in the course of one day was 
 commended by the divisional and task force commanders with march of this year there came a change in the battalion 
 s training cycle and a change in the training area scenery the unit headed off to the interior of south 
 australia arriving at leigh creek 800 km north of adelaide during the two weeks spent in the area the battalion 
 concentrated on training reinforcements 
 87 and conducting delaying defence in limited war within a task force setting yet again the unit was required to 
 do some walking along with lengthy periods of difficult digging however all sub units were able to achieve the objectives 
 given to them the first months of this year also saw development of plans for 3rar to become parachute trained 
 the first group of 50 personnel completed their training at williamstown in new south wales just after easter and another 
 group has left for training all members of the battalion are keen to be selected for the course and there 
 has been no shortage of volunteers the benefits of this training will be realized in the next battalion exercise in 
 august 1981 has also produced the first positive plans for the battalion s move to sydney 3rar is now required 
 to take up residence at holsworthy by february 1982 the move will also incorporate the families of soldiers going to 
 sydney and they are expected to be accommodated 0:accom 0:modated in married quarters by february also along with the exercises 
 the battalion has participated 0:partici 0:pated in there have been numerous sub unit activities and courses conducted over the last 
 ten months 3rar has sent soldiers of all ranks on qualifying courses ranging from nbcd courses to qualifying courses for 
 corporal the battalion has also transferred a number of its soldiers to townsville for service in the army s overseas 
 deployment force as well 3rar has provided sub unit and platoon support for exercises in sydney and melbourne and support 
 for officer cadet training units our officers and ncos have also taken part in a res recruit courses as instructors 
 and cadre staff all these activities have placed a severe drain on the battalion s manpower and fragmented the unit 
 to some degree the situation has been aggravated with the preparations for the move to sydney and the slowing of 
 postings into the unit the announcement of the date of the battalion s move to sydney also required an early 
 farewell by the battalion to the city of adelaide this farewell was appropriately conducted on the 24 april kapyong day 
 in adelaide the parade was performed in front of an appreciative crowd and was reviewed by the regiment s colonel 
 commandant general sir arthur macdonald kbe cb 3rars departure from woodside ends a memorable stay of 16 years at present 
 it is winter in woodside and conditions are bleak harsh and uninviting fortunately some members of the battalion will be 
 seeking respite in a more hospitable climate during june those lucky members will be taking part in a task force 
 command post exercise to be conducted in hawaii and everyone is expecting them to bring back a touch of sunny 
 weather meanwhile it is aloha from 3rar 6rar during 1980 6 rar was given the task of developing an airborne 
 capability based on one of its rifle companies 0:com 0:panies d company wearers of the presidential unit citation for long 
 tan were chosen to be this base other elements of the force were to be a battalion headquarters reconnaissance group 
 a signals detachment 0:detach 0:ment a troop of engineers and a section of assault pioneers the development of this force 
 took a giant leap forward with exercise distant bridge in april this year the first large scale parachute drop of 
 australian forces since world war two one hundred and sixty parachutists deployed from amberley and richmond air bases in four 
 cl3o aircraft after four hours flying a distance of about 2000 km the force jumped into tasmania just short of 
 the small township of ross and quickly secured the abandoned airfield that was the objective each soldier carried an operational 
 load and with up to sixty two parachutists crowded into an aircraft it was a relief for the soldiers to 
 greet the brisk tasmanian air even though it was considerably colder than that of their sub tropical base in brisbane 
 exercise distant bridge was a valuable experience for all involved and a major step in the redevelopment of operational static 
 line parachuting in the australian army it was of particular value for a the development of joint service parachute planning 
 b testing and developing crowded aircraft drills and c giving experience to 6rar personnel in the realistic conditions of a 
 crowded aircraft a long flight and dropping into unfamiliar terrain and climate with the number of parachutists in the battalion 
 approaching the two hundred mark we look forward to further developing this role in 1982 the colonel commandant and all

 the station to wish him farewell there this might mean for her bed at 0300 hours and up at 0500 
 hours 34 bedford place was also a post office there was usually a heap of parcels and stacks of letters 
 in the private sitting room waiting for the owners to pick them up or to be readdressed 0:re 0:addressed how 
 it was all done no one knew since world war i jennie never omitted to send each one of her 
 boys a letter of remembrance and good wishes on his birthday at christmas and the new year she had also 
 developed correspondence with the wives or mothers of many of the living or some who had died during or since 
 the end of world war 1 jennie s mother died in 1921 and was buried at gorleston which is on 
 the north sea adjoining yarmouth and just where suffolk and norfolk meet before world war ii arrived jennie had moved 
 to stanmore middlesex 0:middle 0:sex she lived there throughout the war welcoming and housing while on leave many of the 
 sons nephews of friends of her boys of the 1914 1918 war about 1946 she returned to her gorleston home 
 to live between the wars ever since the peace procession passed the temporary cenotaph erected in the summer of 1919 
 she had placed a wreath for the regiment in memory of all who had fallen this was done each armistice 
 day and later remembrance day until she died with only two ommissions on account of an illness 0:ill 0:ness but

 returning to gorleston she took a great interest in local troops of boy scouts cubs and brownies as mother of 
 so many boys of the first war she was admitted as a member of the local mothers union was a 
 former president of this union and a regular attendant at the weekly meetings each week for four years when help 
 could not be obtained jennie swept the parish church in which her funeral service was held she was very interested 
 in the children of the parish church of st andrews this church is the daughter church of st mary magdelene 
 recently built to serve a new housing estate in which at the time of her death there were attending sunday 
 school services 230 children between the ages of three and eight years and 210 between the ages of eight and 
 twelve years she presented a prize book annually for the most neatly kept book of stamps recording sunday school attendance 
 this prize book carried on the inside cover st mary magdelene s sunday school gorleston aunt jennie s prize award 
 to with the superintendant s signature and date she also gave easter eggs annually to those children whose birthday fell 
 on easter sunday and the cost of the prizes and easter eggs would not on the average exceed 10 shillings 
 a year if provision could in some way be made from proceeds of her estate that these customs be perpetuated 
 it would keep her memory fresh in the community where she lived over so many years and where she was 
 so well known and loved by so many some hundreds of local people attended jennie s funeral despite the cold 
 day and the rain jennie s very good friend and close neighbour spent most of the days in the last 
 two weeks with her and a night nurse was with jennie constantly through the neighbours the last two weeks and 
 was with her when she slipped quietly and easily away in the first hour of saturday the sth of march 
 the vicar of the church had also been calling and spending some of each evening the last week or so
