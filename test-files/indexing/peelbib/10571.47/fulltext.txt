 iii colonel in chief princess patricia s canadian light infantry the countess mountbatten of burma cd jp dl i had 
 the great good fortune to join the patricia s in 1974 the year of our diamond jubilee when i succeeded 
 our regiment s original and much loved colonel in chief lady patricia ramsay in the decade that has passed since 
 then i have been able to visit all our battalions several times both at home and in cyprus and will 
 be visiting germany too and have visited many of our other units all over canada from resolute bay in the 
 high arctic to kingston in the south i have also crossed the country by train from british columbia to new 
 brunswick and found it a fascinating experience wherever my travels visiting my patricia s have taken me i have greatly 
 enjoyed getting to know this wonderful country and her warm and friendly people but best of all has been the 
 opportunity to get to know my regiment very well and meet so many members from privates to generals including their 
 families everywhere and from everyone i have had such a warm welcome that i feel truly a part of our 
 great regiment though separated by an ocean for most of the year i send you all my thanks and appreciation 
 as well as very best wishes for the future 
 iv colonel of the regiment princess patricia s canadian light infantry colonel w b s sutherland cd military historians have 
 often remarked that our regiment is a proud regiment they have said as well that the regiment s pride is 
 solidly based on an illustrious past and a rich tradition they might also have said that ours is a young 
 regiment until very recently we counted amoung our numbers men who had joined the regiment when first it was formed 
 of all these things that historians might have said of our regiment i would commend to you the last we 
 area young regiment in terms of both our years and of the elan which has been a hallmark of the 
 regiment s character we possess now and have always possessed and i dare hope will always possess three attributes of 
 youth which mark successful endeavour vision vitality and valour our founder possessed and displayed these qualities throughout his life he 
 turned them to the service of his country and his fellow men he considered that there could be no higher 
 calling than the calling of service in the cause of one s fellow man and he evidenced this conviction through 
 his life and his actions importantly he endowed the regiment with his example his spirit continues to this day and 
 has become one of our proudest traditions hamilton gault also believed that if one is to serve one s fellow 
 man through the profession of arms in the cause of peace one must be at the leading edge of his 
 profession it has been our greatest pride that we have always been there in both peace and war you and 
 i are the heirs of the founder s spirit and vision these have been the well springs of our success 
 surely they are also the keys to success in the future we are the inheritors of a great military tradition 
 and while we may look to the past for our inspiration it is to the present that we must look 
 if we are to honour the past and secure the future by our accomplishment having spent a good part of 
 these past eighteen months amongst you i can say without hesitation and with considerable pride that you are doing everything 
 the founder would have wished and expected of you both the colonel in chief and i have on many occasions 
 while with you felt hammy s spirit manifest in you i am certain that were he here today he would 
 look upon his regiment with great satisfaction and take much pride in what it has become and what it promises

 3 historical article princess patricia s light infantry beating off a german attack may 8 1915 the battle of ypres 
 1915 frezenberg and bellewaerde ridge so long as faith and freedom lasts and the world goes round the sun this 
 will stand the canadian line held fast and so the fight was won anonymous the princess patricia s canadian light 
 infantry as part of the 80th brigade 27th british division played the crucial role in the second battle of ypres 
 in the spring of 1915 the germans launched a series of ferocious attacks to capture the city of ypres the 
 second battle of ypres 22 april to 17 june 1915 includes two separate but closely related german offensives to capture 
 ypres the first german attack which relied heavily on the use of gas came from the northeast of ypres starting 
 on 22 april losing its momentum by 27 april the brunt of this attack was born by the ist canadian 
 division the second german drive came eleven days later from the east concentrating on a sector in the area of 
 bellewaerde ridge there the princess patricia s canadian light infantry held the vital contact point between the 27th and 28th 
 british divisions the regiment bore the full weight of this german attack this battle occurred on 8 may 1915 and 
 is officially known as the battle of frezenberg and bellewaerde ridge on 8 may 1985 the regiment celebrates the 70th 
 anniversary of the battle of frezenberg this recount of the battle of frezenberg is a tribute to the original patricias 
 who fought lived and died in this battle this is their story and our legacy by lieutenant d n franko 
 by regimental archivist but first a description of the ground the terrain was flat with a few high features a 
 large number of farm cart tracks with fields and copses dotting the landscape there was a small ridge called bellewaerde 
 ridge which ran northeast southwest about three and a half miles east of ypres just to the west of the 
 ridge was a small lake called bellewaerde lake itwasonthisridgewhichthe originals made their famous stand custom design specialists the winners circle

 5 the patricias moved to the ypres sector on 5 april and entered the trenches on 9 april at polygon 
 wood a salient in the british line initially activity was quiet however on 22 april the germans began their first 
 attack to the north near passchendaele the germans failed to break through the british line but they managed to push 
 the line back the british command decided to straighten out the line by a withdrawal from the polygon wood salient 
 to a line along the bellewaerde ridge during this time period the german artillery rained shrapnel on the patricias causing 
 many casualties the regiment withdrew to their new line on the night of 3 may the plan called for gradual 
 retirement until there were only 20 men and one officer left and the orders were to retire at zero hour 
 twenty minutes to midnight a c peacock i was one of the last men to leave the front line at 
 polygon wood those of us who remained behind to cover the withdrawal would fire a shot at an enemy trench 
 walk down the trench 10 yards and fire another shot making fritz believe the line was still fully occupied j 
 w vaughan there was no continuous line of trenches in those days and to maintain liaison with the battalions on 
 our flanks it was necessary to send two men with instructions to return to their unit just before zero hours 
 upon instructions from the officer in charge in our case the yorkshire light infantry private o brien and myself were 
 detailed and left the trench shortly before zero hour a gap of around 100 yards separated the two battalions and 
 we dashed across but unfortunately got into an old trench that ran out in front we discovered this when bullets 
 were coming from our front and rear we started to crawl back and after a while i discovered that o 
 brien was not following and so went back his pack was caught in some old barbed wire and when i 
 pulled out my jack knife to cut the straps he protested vigorously but i had to do it next morning 
 after we had retired some three or four miles i asked him why he didn t want to have his 
 pack cut and he replied it had a picture of my best girl and i didn t want to leave 
 it hanging on the wire for fritz to get a c peacock the new line at bellewaerde ridge left much 
 to be desired the trenches were shallow in some cases full of water and the position was exposed to enemy 
 fire from the front and flanks at first light on 4 may the germans discovered the withdrawal of the british 
 divisions they moved quickly to fill the gap and soon brought heavy accurate artillery and machine gun fire onto the 
 trenches the patricias who suffered 122 casualties that day were relieved by the kings shropshire light infantry at night they 
 moved into reserve at a spot called hellfire corner where colonel buller the commanding officer was wounded major hamilton gault 
 who returned a few days earlier after recovering from a wound assumed command during the evening of 6 may the 
 patricias moved back into the trenches at bellewaerde ridge with a strength of 14 officers and less than 600 other 
 ranks on 7 may the germans continued to pour concentrated fire onto the ridge the disposition of the british units 
 on 8 may was as follows the patricias were the left hand unit of the 27th british division with the 
 remainder of the 80th brigade to their right and rear the 4th kings royal rifle corps were on the regiment 
 s right the kings shropshire light infantry the 4th rifle brigade and the 3rd kings royal rifle corps were all 
 in brigade reserve in the area of bellewaerde lake if the germans broke through this line there was nothing to 
 stop them except an emergency headquarters trench line to the east of ypres the defence of this whole sector was 
 contingent on holding the bellewaerde ridge the patricias had a main trench frontage of 600 yards with a support trench 
 in the rear the support trench was no more than a few ditches behind some hedges there were no communication 
 trenches to speak of only some shallow ditches connecting the two lines all the positions were exposed to enemy fire 
 the battalion layout was no 1 company right front no 2 company left front no 3 company right support and 
 no 4 company left support the battle of frezenberg was not fought by fresh soldiers the regiment had spent 15 
 of the 17 previous days in the line and the soldiers were mentally and physically exhausted by the stress of 
 the battle these soldiers had spent almost the entire period under constant shellfire one quarter of their manpower had been 
 lost they had conducted a difficult withdrawal and tried as best they could under fire in water and mud up 
 to their knees and waists to strengthen the line of defence on the ridge the early hours of 8 may 
 were unnaturally quiet however on the morning of the bth at bellewaerde lake we were rudely awakened by a shell 
 bursting in our lean to artillery dugout no 4 company was in support one man had his head blown off 
 while he cleaned his rifle in fact most of us were hit with fragments of shrapnel we all rushed out 
 and got into the trench a piece had cut through my belt and was rubbing my side wright dug it 
 out to prevent infection i did the same to others from that time on it was hell the shells came 
 thick and fast making us all hug the ground one shell landed between bill dalby and me i grasped dalby 
 s hand expecting to go up happily it was a dud it made a big hole about nine inches across 
 bill vail was there with us he disappeared into thin air w j popey the germans decided to use a 
 massive artillery bombardment as opposed to gas to break through the frontline bellewaerde ridge became an inferno and to those 
 in the trenches the world seemed alive and rocking with the flashing and crashing of bursting shells bursts of shrapnel 
 mowed down men high explosives more or less obliterated the front line blew away all the wire and cut off 
 the regiment from all communications with its support ppcli volume i the german bombardment had been so heavy since may 
 4th that a wood which the regiment had used in part for cover was completely demolished the range of our 
 machine guns were taken with extreme precision all without exception were buried those who served them behaved with the most 
 admirable coolness and gallantry corporal dover stuck to his gun throughout 0:through 0:out and although wounded continued to discharge his 
 duties with as much coolness as if on parade in the explosion that ended his ill fated gun he lost 
 a leg and an arm and was completely buried in the debris conscious or unconscious he lay there in that 
 condition until dusk when he crawled out of the obliterated trench and moaned for help two of his comrades sprang 
 from the support trench and started to carry his mangled and bleeding body away but as all that remained of 
 this brave soldier was being lowered into the trench a bullet put an end to his suffering no bullet could 
 put an end to his glory g pearson the first german assault came about 7 a m and though the 
 patricia line was thin it held as deadly rifle fire was brought to bear upon the enemy our rifles got 
 so hot we had to change our rifles to keep up the fire w j popey however some german machine 
 gun crews managed to get a foothold near the patricia trenches and were able to spray the ridge line with 
 heavy and accurate machine gun fire added to this artillery fire turned the front line into a mash of shell 
 holes the main assault was delivered at about 9 a m there seemed to bean astounding silence with just an 
 occasional rifleshot and then we realized that the german infantry were upon us ppcli volume i once again heavy rifle 
 fire from the patricia line brought the enemy to a halt but on the right no 2 company s position 
 was over run in a few places by the germans there seemed to be dozens of them climbed over and 
 through the broken wire into the trenches bayonetting the wounded as they came ppcli volume i george easton was firing 
 with me at the gray mass of the oncoming horde my rifle s jammed he cried 
 6 take mine and i stooped to get one from a casualty underfoot but a moment later as i fired 
 from the parapet my bayonet was broken off by a german bullet i shouted wildly to cosh to toss me 
 one from nearby just then the main body of the germans swarmed into the end of the trench bugler lee 
 shouted to me i m shot through the leg a couple of us seized him planning to go down to 
 where the communication trench had once been but he stopped us saying it s no good boys it s a 
 dead end they re killing us cosh swore don t give up kid we ll beat the yet a german 
 a few yards away raised his rifle and blew his head off young brown broke down at this they had 
 just done in his wounded pal oh look look what they ve done to davie and fell to weeping and 
 with that another put the muzzle of his rifle against the boy s head and pulled the trigger young cox 
 from winnipeg put his hands above his head at the order his captor placed the muzzle of his rifle squarely 
 against the palm and blew it off there remained only a bloody and broken mass dangling from the wrist i 
 saw a man who had come up in the draft with me on the 4th rolling around in the death 
 agony tossing his head loosely about in the wild pain of it his pallid face a white mark in the 
 muck underfoot a burly german reached the spot and without hesitation plunged the saw edged bayonet through the throat close 
 by another wounded man was struggling feebly under a pile of earth his legs projecting so that only the convulsive 
 heaving of the loose earth indicated that a man was dying underneath another german observed that too and shoved his 
 bayonet through the mud and held it savagely there until all was quiet sergeant phillpots had been shot through the 
 ja w so that he went to his knees as a bullock does at the slaughtering he supported himself waveringly 
 by his hand the blood poured from him so that he was all but fainting with the loss of it 
 a big german stood over him phillpots looked up play the game play the game he muttered weakly the german 
 cooly put a round through his head i was still without a bayonet and seeing these things said to easton 
 we d better beat it he swore again yes they re murdering us no use stopping here come on and 
 just then he too dropped i thought him dead there was no use in my stopping to share his fate 
 or worse it was every man for himself at a later date we met in england the other half of 
 the regiment lay in support two hundred yards away in bellewaerde wood and in front of the chateau and lake 
 of that name where my draft had lain in on the fourth i made a dash for it what with 
 the mud and the many shell holes the going was bad i was indistinctly aware of a great deal of 
 promiscuous shooting at me but most distinctly of one german who shot at me about ten times in as many 
 yards and from quite close range i saw i could not make it i flung myself into a johnson hole 
 and as soon as i had caught my breath scrambled out again and raced for the trench i had just 
 left i was by this time unarmed having flung my rifle away to further my flight notwithstanding which another german 
 shot at me as i went towards him as i landed in the trench an angry voice shouted something i 
 could not understand and i scrambled to my feet in time to see a german sullenly lower his rifle from 
 the level of my body at the command of a big black bearded officer g pearson it was during the 
 main german assault that the line held by the 27th british division on the patricia s left began to crumble 
 through the confusion the smoke and the noise no 1 company misinterpreted the british retreat as a local withdrawal upon 
 realizing their mistake the company rallied and retook their trenches a little while later no 1 and 2 companies had 
 to withdraw from their trenches because of the overwhelming number of germans in or near their front line many officers 
 and men sacrificed their lives in rear guard actions to cover the withdrawal of fellow patricias back to the support 
 trench as the day went on many of the officers and non commissioned officers were either wounded or killed but 
 the regiment was never leaderless because the privates and corporals took command 0:com 0:mand of sections and platoons and the 
 sergeants and warrant officers of companies devotion to duty despite the odds held the fabric of the regiment together this 
 was exemplified by the exceptional feats of valour performed by the soldiers throughout the day single handed nco s and 
 men moved to cover the gaps left by the artillery explosions they adjusted to the changing situations as best they 
 could in the confusion of war soldier carrying bombs for his comrades old dutch potato chips v a 2 1

 deadly with a rifle and accounted for many a german that day regimental sergeant major a fraser was killed as 
 he stood of the parados of the trench serving out ammunition and directing fire in contempt of death ppcli volume 
 i corporal e bowler a medical orderly distinguished himself by rescuing soldiers while under fire and aiding the wounded as 
 best he could several times he braved the bullets and barrages to go back for new supplies of morphine and 
 surgical dressings even though the air was heavy with the smell of cordite and death there was still time for 
 compassion i was wounded around 10 o clock on the morning of the bth of may i shall never forget 
 captain papineau to me he was the coolest bravest and yet the gentlest soldier i have ever known he came 
 along the trench and knelt down beside me asked how i felt and said we ll get you out of 
 here as soon as we can j w vaughan hammie gault was badly hit and only semi conscious for the 
 rest of the day i attended to him frequently and got him propped up so that he was lengthwise in 
 the trench i kept wetting his lips from my water bottle but his eyes were turned right back into his 
 head and only the white of his eyes were visible h niven captain agar adamson took over command but soon 
 he too was wounded despite his wounds he continued to rally the soldiers distribute ammunition and personally direct reinforcements 0:rein 
 0:forcements into the line during a lull in the artillery fire two companies of the rifle brigade came forward to 
 reinforce the patricia line the beleaguered 0:be 0:leaguered garrison of soldiers on the ridge cheered when they saw their reinforcements 
 arrive but above all the most appreciated 0:ap 0:preciated gifts were machine guns and bandoliers of ammunition as by now 
 ammunition was low and there were gaps in the defence soldiers were forced to crawl amongst the wounded and the 
 dead to look for bullets and bombs and to find rifles that were operable on the bth of may we 
 saw angels and they wore the letters r b on their shoulder and the biggest angels were those who bore 
 the machine guns on their shoulders ppcli sergeant ppcli volume i the patricia s left flank was totally exposed by 
 the withdrawal of the 27th british division behind the bellewaerde ridge line as the regiment was cut off from communications 
 with its headquarters 0:head 0:quarters their knowledge of the situation was limited the patricias never knew the graveness of their 
 position and how easily they could have been surrounded and annihilated the most critical time for the regiment occurred between 
 10 a m and 2 p m the germans opened up again more furiously than ever and smashed anything that 
 was left of the trenches the few remaining machine guns had no proper emplacements and were ranged upon with astounding 
 accuracy but by the greatest exertions most of them were kept in action two were buried and remounted buried again 
 and remounted again one was dug out three times and only ceased firing with the death of every man in 
 its crew another was fought single handed by a corporal until it exploded and a third was kept in action 
 by another corporal working by himself captain agar adamson although painfully wounded continued to direct the defence with the utmost 
 coolness heartening the men by cheery words as he moved about distributing 0:distri 0:buting ammunition with his unwounded arm the 
 germans could make no headway several times they tried after a short burst of particularly intense gun fire to debouch 
 from the captured trenches always to be beaten back by rifle fire before their movement could become dangerous it was 
 the great hour of the originals and of their successors none ever grudged the honour of making the regiment s 
 name to the men who held the bellewaerde ridge trenches machine guns all but five officers 80 percent of the 
 men were gone there was a great gap on the flank the crumbling ditch that did duty for a trench 
 was open to fire from three sides but the iron grip on the ridge was never loosed and the officer 
 commanding the shropshires reported in the heat of battle that not one man from the patricias was coming back except 
 an occasional stretcher bearer on duty ppcli volume i by mid afternoon the tension of the battle had slackened the 
 germans made one final attempt at about 3 p m but had no success the 28th british division began to 
 counter attack and by late afternoon contact with the patricia left flank was reestablished 0:re 0:established as darkness fell the 
 exhausted soldiers were able to relax a little and begin to move their stretcher cases back to the rear many 
 of the dead were buried where they lay lieutenant niven who throughout the day distinguished himself with many feats of 
 valour took command of the regiment the colour was found buried in a dugout battered but still intact lieutenant niven 
 and the remainder of the patricias gathered in the rear of the bellewaerde ridge late that night beside a mass 
 grave littered with their slain comrades bodies by the light of the german flares the whistle of bullets and the 
 crump of artillery the soldiers gave their final respects to those who had died with colour in hand lieutenant niven 
 cited from memory as best he could the church of england service for the dead death of princess pats 
 8 then the princess patricia s canadian light infantry formed up and with the colour flying high they withdrew from 
 the bellewaerde ridge a roll call that night showed a strength of four officers and 150 other ranks the casualty 
 record for 8 may was 392 all ranks officers 4 killed or missing 6 wounded other ranks 108 killed 197 
 wounded and 77 missing of the missing only a few reached the german prison camps thus the total killed was 
 well over 175 the regiment had the largest casualty list in the 27th british division from the second battle of 
 ypres between 22 april and 17 may 700 all ranks were killed wounded or missing in action bellewaerde ridge is 
 known as the grave site for the originals at the close of the second battle of ypres the princess patricia 
 s canadian light infantry as a band of old regulars and reservists ceased to be ppcli volume i the commander 
 in chief of the british forces paid the soldiers of the brigade a compliment speaking in a simple fashion as 
 between soldier and soldier you held on to your trenches in the most magnificent manner under a most severe bombardment 
 than ever has been known and in doing so you have been the greatest assistance to the operations which the 
 british army was carrying out at that time men who have merely to lie down under a fire like that 
 are apt to think they are undergoing war rather than making war by holding on to your trenches you prevented 
 the germans from obtaining an objective which it was very necessary for them to obtain they wanted to take ypres 
 and to be able to tell the whole of europe and america that they had taken ypres and if they 
 had done so this would have done a lot of harm to remain in the trenches under a heavy artillery 
 bombardment to keep your heads and your discipline and to be able to use your rifles at the end of 
 it requires far higher qualities of personal bravery than to actively attack the enemy when everybody is on the move 
 and conscious of doing something ppcli volume i these words of praise paid tribute to those who fought on bellewaerde 
 ridge on 8 may 1915 however the greatest tribute a soldier can receive is from another soldier as the remnant 
 of the regiment moved out after the action their comrades of the 80th brigade turned out on one accord lined 
 the road swept off their caps to the colour and cheered and cheered again ppcli volume i patricias decorations awarded

 data on regimental contributions indicate that 1908 patricias are paying their 1985 donation by monthly pay assignment regimental finances the 
 regiment s finances are now administered by a full time trained accounting sergeant who is supervised by the regimental 0:regimen 
 0:tal adjutant all accounts are internally audited quarterly and officially audited by coopers and lybrand annually the annual audited financial 
 statements will be published in the ppcli annual report the regiment and the association were granted authority by revenue canada 
 in early 1984 to accumulate charitable donations 0:dona 0:tions from year to year until 1989 to finance anticipated seventy fifth 
 anniversary expenses basically what this means is that the regiment and the association do not have to expend eighty percent 
 of all contributions annually what it does mean however is that the regiment must spend eighty percent of all receipted 
 donations between now and 1989 on revenue canada approved seventy fifth anniversary expenditures gifts museum construction 0:con 0:struction uniforms ceremonial 
 activities etc the more revenue the regiment and the association can raise between now and 1989 the better our celebration 
 and the more revenue the regiment 0:regi 0:ment can retain for the future of the regiment twenty percent of the 
 total receipted donations raised between now and 1989 may be retained to guarantee the long term financial health of the 
 regiment the regiment the association and the hgmf currently have a total of 180 x invested in short and long 
 term certificates regimental fund raising in 1984 2 and 3 ppcli raised 15 x each for the regiment 1 ppcli

 three personnel under the new employment expansion and development 0:develop 0:ment need programme and 13 x under the summer student 
 works programme to hire four students both programmes were of great benefit to rhq in areas such as data processing 
 and museum archives cataloguing for 1985 2 and 3 ppcli will again be attempting to raise 15 x each for 
 the regiment 1 ppcli and rhq will attempt to raise 35 k 1 ppcli and rhq s success will be

 hire staff on government works programmes the regimental museum and archives an rhq staff of four personnel have been working 
 full time for the past year cataloguing museum artifacts and archival documents 0:docu 0:ments the initial phase of this project 
 cataloguing will hopefully be completed by the end of august 85 during the next phase of the project all items 
 will be photographed appraised and the records computerized once all museum artifacts are appraised the regiment will then finally have 
 insurance on our museum contents it is a long tedious process which requires our full attention another aspect of the 
 museum cataloguing which is being conducted simultaneous is the cataloguing and ownership transfer of all our unit non public property 
 to our regimental museum this is an equally long and tedious process which must also be completed as soon as 
 possible the regiment has recently published an extremely attractive museum brochure and produced a superb professional audiovisual 0:audio 0:visual presentation 
 on the museum the presentation package is used to solicit financial support for the museum the regimental museum attendance in 
 1984 was 5 756 up from 3 600 in 1983 museum box donations totalled 451 60 the regiment received 4

 was a programmer who helped us in the design of our data management system the regiment now has computerized records

 15 why support the regiment by major d b stevenson cd we belong to our regiment for many different reasons 
 family tradition personal preference geographical location or because we were posted to it are but a few many of us 
 nod sagely when we read the regimental history and try to imagine what it was like in battle when it 
 was the regiment that held men together when fighting and dying far from home the regimental family provided the sense 
 of belonging support and comradeship that enabled men to keep fighting with the will to win except for a very 
 small minority remaining today in the canadian 0:cana 0:dian forces however most of us have never endured this ordeal of 
 war which required us to reach out for the regiment s support or for it to be provided we take 
 our regiment for granted and complain about our dues or whatever but we are wrong if this is our attitude 
 without trying to make this sound like a testimonial i would like to reach all of my brother patricias and 
 to thank my regimental family for the support that was provided me during a personal family tragedy that left me 
 shattered and alone details are irrelevent 0:irrele 0:vent the point is that when i was in the depths of despair 
 the regiment provided that moral support that we read about in the history books the great number of individuals of 
 all ranks who took the time to write or call is proof that the regimental spirit is alive and well 
 in the patricias a simple card from officers and soldiers of the battalion princess patricia s canadian light infantry contributed 
 in no small way to easing my personal pain i and others have taken our regiment for granted the past 
 year is clear evidence that the regiment did not take me for granted this i will never forget and am 
 extremely proud to be a patricia to finally get to my point all of us must support our regiment with 
 all our efforts in peace as well as in war because it certainly supports each and every one of us 
 the regiment is a living thing embodied in all of us who serve let us serve it well 3 retired

 all the various aspects of preparation and planning normally associated with a conventional unit in the second phase from february 
 until november the battalion switched roles to prepare then execute a six month peacekeeping tour in cyprus holding sector four 
 of the green line simultaneously c company plus elements of combat support company moved into high gear in their very 
 active role as rear party basic machine gun course course officer lt semi an aw because the battalion was physically 
 split between canada and cyprus for six months each company whether in nicosia or calgary developed a distinct mission and 
 thus a strong identity it is from this point of view that the year s events will be reviewed a 
 company the fall started with the company participating in ex sharpshooter 0:sharp 0:shooter the annual range classification shoot many long 
 hours were spent on the wainwright ranges refining everyone s shooting skills on both primary and alternate weapons thankfully the 
 well known wainwright weather conditions remained favourable throughout the week and a great deal of success was had by all 
 no sooner had the company returned from wainwright than preparations began for the fall pcf course cycle a company was 
 tasked to run a driver wheeled course headed by lt c t mcknight all instructors were drawn from the ranks 
 of the company the high standard achieved by course candidates attested to the effectiveness of the instructional staff throughout the 
 fall a company placed heavy emphasis on its participation in the inter company sports programme as is traditional the french 
 grey cup was the highlight of the season and much to the chagrin of all others involved especially combat support 
 company a company was victorious for the second straight year the game was a hard fought defensive struggle but after 
 some last minute heroics by lt john turner and pte fig kennedy a company came out on top after an 
 all too short christmas leave period the company returned to set out once again for the wilds of wainwright for 
 ex rapier thrust 84 after some intensive platoon and company training everyone was put to the test in a three 
 day company level live fire defence scenario followed by platoon level live fire ambush patrols who will ever forget the 
 company headquarters bunker the final brigade exercise provided many challenges not the least of them a flu bug that ravaged 
 the company but the company stood fast playing its part in stopping the enemy hordes upon completion of ex rapier 
 thrust the company quickly switched to its new task that of preparing for a summer tour in cyprus after two 
 months of preparation the company took over the western half of sector four which stretched from the western suburbs of 
 nicosia to the middle of the old walled city the company s deployment was varied a platoon working from a 
 centralized platoon house in the old city another platoon split between three section houses in the suburbs and a platoon

 23 conducting reserve garrison duties from the ledra palace hotel at wolseley barracks the entire company attacked the task professionally 
 and settled in for a long and hot six months a healthy rivalry between all companies quickly surfaced and was 
 very apparent in the units active sports programme during both halves of the tour a company came away as the 
 overall winners members of a company eagerly looked forward to a safe return to canada in early october when it 
 will be time to turn back to the basics of soldiering in preparation for the year to come b company 
 b company will remember 1983 84 as a busy and challenging one not all the challenges were greeted with whole 
 hearted enthusiasm but none the less they were tackled in a truly professional manner and the company discharged its duties 
 with typical flair the fall of 1983 brought with it the normal spectrum of pcfand leadership courses as always though 
 some people were not slated for any courses so it was necessary to keep up the training for those left 
 behind in october about 20 soldiers were treated to a short mountaineering course at the foot of mt athabasca 11 
 452 the three day event was sponsored by the brigade and organized by maj kenward and lt maclaine two of 
 the many avid climbers in the company after a couple of days of poor but not uncommon weather and basic 
 training in the use of ice axes crampons and crevasse rescue techniques the 20 man party set out in the 
 dark of night to climb athabasca itself regrettably the expedition was forced to turn back at the 10 000 level 
 due to extreme avalanche danger considerably wiser in the art of alpine mobility despite their disappointment all the participants agreed 
 that the trip had been a success and would be well worth trying again col col j h s kempling 
 and rsm e c simpson carve the turkey at the annual mens christmas dinner november also had its share of 
 fun with a company airmobile attack into suffield to wipe out the last vestiges of that sinister organization crap canadian 
 revolutionary army of the people for this four day counter guerilla exercise the b company nucleus had to be beefed 
 up with elements of administration and combat support company not to mention a platoon of enemy that a company thoughtfully 
 provided the exercise gave the new platoon commanders the opportunity to familiarize themselves 0:them 0:selves with their men and discover 
 the joys of navigation in suffield the final attack on crap headquarters was accomplished 0:accom 0:plished in adaring pre dawn 
 raid which burnt much of the prairie and triggered a number of large explosions you never know what you might 
 find lying around in suffield all of which seemed to make the long march through the night worthwhile after the 
 regular festivities of christmas b company reassembled 0:reas 0:sembled to participate in rapier thrust the exercise proved valuable for several 
 reasons it was proven once and for all that one can in fact dig trenches in winter at least in 
 wainwright it was a gruelling exercise and many people learned their limits of physical exhaustion and the old saying if 
 you don t like the weather in wainwright just wait 10 minutes was confirmed as the temperature went from 40 
 c to 5 c and back down again and of course we learned to expect nothing good from the air 
 force for without exception the company was never dropped on the correct lz at endex everyone breathed a sigh of 
 relief when it was announced that we would be returning to bivouac by truck and not helicopter in february a 
 four day ski trip to lake louise was arranged for personnel not otherwise committed done at a special group rate 
 all participants found it well worth the money hopefully it will become an annual occurrence despite some rather unusual styles 
 of skiing no one got injured good luck rather than good form is credited with that amazing fact as the 
 battalion deployed to cyprus in early april b company initially occupied the much loved camp maple leaf but had to 
 close out and move down to the ledra hotel with great regret when headquarters decided that it was no longer 
 practical to work out of cml concurrent with the move out of cml was the occupation of frezenberg house a 
 new platoon house which was officially opened by lady patricia on 7 may 1984 of course this redeployment on the 
 line brought with it a requirement to build new bunkers and improve the old ones this formidable task was accomplished 
 by the end of august and there now exists three monuments to b company on line east the heineken bunker 
 at ortona house 5 platoon marvel the tac hq bunker at c 58 donated by 6 platoon and the frezenberg 
 bunker complete with cathedral ceiling courtesy of 4 platoon in all the company filled over 15 000 sandbags and created 
 an olympic swimming pool to boot company pt continued at its usual albeit fast pace and the nicosia to calgary

 24 while in the reserve role the platoons were able to get out and do some interesting training on their 
 own and soldiers who had time off i want to know who they are were able to visit the beaches 
 and perhaps taste a bit of swedish culture recreation at the pool at ledra palace cyprus as the tour drew 
 to a close a number of manning changes were in store which would permanently alter the face of the company 
 no one will forget their time in cyprus no matter how hard they try and everyone looked forward to a 
 good year back in civilization c company for c company the past year has been one of many different activities 
 and excitement and although we did not get to go to cyprus with the rest of the battalion our activities 
 on rear party by far made up for it as with other companies c company participated in the usual year 
 s beginning activities by a short stay in wainwright for the annual weapons classification followed by the normal onslaught of 
 pcf courses christmas leave came and went and soon we were out once more in wainwright freezing ourselves along with 
 the rest of the battalion on ex rapier thrust 84 while the remainder of the battalion prepared for cyprus our 
 company launched itself into the first of a series of activities that would keep us busy for the next seven 
 months while the battalion was gone again there were pcf courses to run as a majority of the company was 
 fresh out of training from battle school soldiers were qualified in two main areas here avgp and machine gun as 
 this would be essential later on in the months to come soon the month of may was upon us and 
 once more sigh will it ever end it was off to good old wainwright for waincon 84 this time however 
 the training was exceptionally exciting and valuable as we worked extensively with the ldsh rc as part of the brigade 
 enemy force and saw the combat team and battle group from a tanker s point of view but the fun 
 doesn t stop there for mid june was quick to come and it was off on adventure training time was 
 spent on vancouver island up the west coast trail and caving followed by atrip to the yukon territory for some 
 hiking and canoeing who says that there s no life like it block leave was a nice change of pace 
 though and a well earned break from all of the hardships of rear party i am sure that one or 
 two of us even thought of our poor brothers in arms sweating it out in cyprus on op duty i 
 hear where it is 120 c plus at the end of july over there we were no sooner back to 
 work when we were hard at it again but this time it was off to mountain school held during the 
 month of september the school had 62 students including six calgary highlanders and three members of the ppcli cadet corps 
 it was a week long course with rock climbing repelling rope bridging snow and ice climbing at the haig and 
 forbes glaciers in the kananaskis and casualty evacuation and rescue systems thankfully 0:thank 0:fully there were no major injuries and 
 everyone thoroughly enjoyed themselves special thanks however is due to wo baxter the ko and his crew for a job 
 well done in the field kitchen by keeping us well fed and alive and finally c company summed up their 
 year of excitement with a touch of coup de gras we participated in batus british army training unit suffield on 
 one of seven annual three week medicine man exercises as a result of the 4th 7th royal dragoon guards battle 
 group 4 7 dg bg only being able to bring one rifle company from germany all ammunition used on this 
 exercise is live and this of course adds to the realism overhead gpmg fire and demolitions were in common use 
 by the batus staff and everything from 60mm mortar live carl gustav bangalore 0:banga 0:lore torpedos and chieftain tanks were 
 experienced training ranged from section level to as high as a tank heavy battle group attack with d squadron of 
 4 7 dg with artillery and mortars in support we even got to exchange rations with c company of the 
 first battalion royal regiment of wales and the common feeling was that even the imp ham omelette has a far 
 better taste than the british compo rations unfortunately due to bad weather conditions 0:con 0:ditions training had to cease but 
 not without first learning many valuable lessons with obvious improvement in the soldier s combat skills in just two weeks 
 of training it was obvious that more training of this calibre is necessary looking back over the whole year c 
 company was quite fortunate due to the battalion being in cyprus we had more opportunities than normal to get in 
 some good training and that s exactly what we did of course we would have loved to have gone to 
 the island of love and bask in the sun working on our suntans but we also understood that someone had

 25 combat support company for those members of the inner circle of people who remained present from september 1983 until 
 deployment to cyprus in march 1984 combat support company was affectionately known as combat support platoon well over half of 
 the largest company in the battalion found themselves scattered in small groups everywhere from ctc gagetown to the brigade to 
 the battle school training yteps there were career courses pcf courses brigade courses and cp exercises run throughout this period 
 and as a result some friendly faces were missing for periods of up to six months it is for this 
 reason that combat support company can only be talked about by events rather than by individuals or platoons the annual 
 weapons classification period took place as usual in september 1983 and although many groans were heard from those troops fresh 
 off block leave another short stay in good old wainwright was not only inevitable but necessary of course as if 
 reading a book weapons classification is always followed by pcf courses this year however courses were focused on our upcoming 
 tour in cyprus and as a result only two platoons were involved armoured defence platoon adp as our resident apc 
 experts ran two basic driver track courses and signals platoon ran two basic communications courses christmas leave came and went 
 and shortly afterwards exercise rapier thrust 84 was well underway here combat support company was fairly active albeit in modest 
 numbers pioneer platoon consisting of 12 men and recce platoon with its two detachments busied themselves with the preparation and 
 staffing of the rifle company live fire exercise adp tried a new twist by mounting a tow on a toboggan 
 and conducting trials on its effectiveness finally signals platoon and our intelligence section were employed by trying out different styles 
 and set ups for the battalion command post all in all it proved to be a fairly worthwhile exercise the 
 really hectic period began after redeployment to calgary there was a lot of work to be done and very little 
 time to do it as the cyprus tour was rapidly approaching a complete reorganization 0:reor 0:ganization of the company was 
 necessary to meet its commitments change of comd in cyprus gen greinda i comd unficyp signs over sector 4 from 
 2 rcr to 1 ppcli and consequently pioneer platoon and adp were required to disband for the upcoming six month 
 period recce platoon grew in size as they picked up the extra soldiers who would double as the battalion s 
 new band and strange organizations such as a humanitarian cell and an operations cell complete with clerks and duty officers 
 developed for the operation briefings for cyprus were held on all levels including briefings for dependants and departure assistance groups 
 dags were common soldiers were required to make pay allotments and all personal paperwork had to be updated everyone was 
 rushed and confused for the most part but most certainly very very busy of course the innocent passer by could 
 not help but notice the occasional death like screams of the dedicated clerks as they pulled their hair out in 
 agony even so the job was done the advance party finally departed on 28 march 1984 and upon arrival in 
 cyprus it was quite obvious that the other englishspeaking 0:english 0:speaking regiment 2 rcr was overjoyed to see us two 
 weeks later sector four responsible for the general area of nicosia was ours and there was quite a lot to 
 keep one busy the rsm for instance got an early grip and began a massive painting project to undo the 
 rcr s artistic abilities that were scattered throughout the sector combat support company now became known as headquarters company and 
 consisted in brief of the joint operations centre where the duty officers hung their hats the information section intelligence in 
 disguise the humanitarian section working with civilians in the buffer zone recce platoon complete with the band signals platoon the 
 mp section and the command group probably the most interesting portion of this massive organization 0:organ 0:ization would be the 
 band formed in january 1984 and consisting of a drum line and instrumental section it is totally made up of 
 professional soldiers from the battalion with little or no musical experience continuous practice paid off though as they put on 
 a good show during frezenburg day their first real public appearance 0:ap 0:pearance and finally at the medals parade on 
 21 august 1984 credit and praise is due to them for their proud efforts and especially to drum major robert 
 zubkowski he s always looking for new additions to the band for working so hard to make them worthwhile of 
 course all of combat support company could not go to cyprus and therefore those unfortunate individuals in mortar platoon who 
 remained in canada must be remembered as they were kept quite busy also running two basic mortarman courses and attending 
 ex waincon 84 the latter was probably the most interesting of their experiences as it was spent under command of 
 3 rcha and they worked not only with their own mortars but also completed familiarization training on the m 109s 
 this was followed by adventure training in which they completed a one week 10 speed bike trip from jasper to 
 banff some people really have it hard eh in retrospect the last year has been one of many different happenings 
 and events massive changes and sometimes confusion 0:confu 0:sion the company now looks forward to its much deserved disembarkation leave 
 followed shortly from cyprus to good old alaska for exercise brim frost in january 1985 administration company administration company was 
 as busy as ever this year supporting the battalion during exercises sharpshooter and rapier thrust numerous pcf courses and of 
 course last but not least cyprus the year began with september s normal trip to wainwright for the annual weapons 
 classification but unlike other companies we not only shoot but we have our normal job of supporting the battalion in 
 everything from rations to vehicles and maintenance to bullets the pcf cycle followed quickly and although our only direct contact 
 with staffing is usually for driving courses let us not forget that everyone still needs those vehicles and weapons fixed 
 and rations and stores for their courses christmas break was a welcomed relief and also our last real break before 
 the big panic started shortly after return to work it was off to good old wainwright again for ex rapier 
 thrust 84 and of course despite the cold weather the requirement for administrative support was just as strong as ever 
 neither rain nor sleet nor snow if only the postal system was as good eh immediately after rapier thrust all 
 the administration company platoons began preparing the battalion for cyprus the medical section screened over 600 personnel for un duty 
 there is of course no truth to the story that the mo was doing the last few medicals as the 
 707 taxied to the terminal needles yes medicals no

 grew to a new strength required to handle their numerous taskings in cyprus and the platoon spent time in suffield 
 experiencing right hand driving the only driving situation unsimulated was avoiding careening cypriot cabs and scooters which was a life 
 and death experience in itself maintenance platoon prepared the battalion vehicles for storage 0:stor 0:age the platoon tested out the 
 new airflex bags a system that appears to be very successful and may be instituted by the cf nation wide 
 battalion qm was busy issuing blue berets hat badges and un accoutrements as well as preparing the many stores that 
 the battalion would require during the tour one of the busiest sections of the company was the boft there were 
 innumerable forms to issue and action as well as the departure assistance group dag to set up and run finally 
 it was off to cyprus and what could only be termed as an interesting and challenging experience our ranks swelled 
 with the addition of fmcaugmenteesand 1 cbg reinforcements from calgary shilo and chilliwack we were suddenly faced with more than 
 just the problems of resupplying beans and bullets how do i get to sweden administration company now known as logistics 
 company handled all the maintenance resupply transport welfare pay canex and engineering support of the battalion duties ranged from hauling 
 water from the troodos mountains to providing guided tours of the island sights to building observation posts and fixing air 
 conditioners all in all it was a very busy tour so now it s back to calgary again as administration 
 company and some sense of normalization but then again it s also back to lots of snow a severe temperature 
 change and alaska in january 1985 and you just can t seem to find a good beach in calgary these 
 days as hectic as the year has been it has been a very satisfying one the battalion won many lucrative 
 competitions which is indicative of the hard work and professionalism each and every soldier has shown the highlights of the 
 year started with the visit of our colonel in chief we enjoyed a very event filled week with lady patricia 
 that included the opening of frezenberg house on the green line a frezenberg drum head service and a myriad of 
 social activities all in all it was a great treat for everyone lt mike beaudette takes ist place at track 
 and field in dhekelia cyprus the high standard of professionalism and expertise did not stop on the green line on 
 exercise or the parade square the same dedication and competative rivalry came through in the many sports and shooting competitions 
 throughout the year we started by being squeezed out of the aggregate for ex strong contender by one point then 
 beating the british commonwealth 0:common 0:wealth tug o war champions in cyprus to capture the tug o war crown and 
 claiming the military basketball championship in cyprus our prowess in shooting started by a victory in the unficyp shooting competition 
 winning every event and weapon class the first time one unit has accomplished this feat in unficyp history to prove 
 the calibre of our shooting skills the battalion went on to win the hamilton gault trophy and the hamilton gault 
 skill at arms trophy won by a company with b compay a close second as you can see a very 
 successful year the hard work and dedication of every member in the battalion has paid off with world wide recognition 
 it only goes to show that the first is indeed the finestii am sure next year will be equally gratifying

 this exercise was to be different as we were to be the enemy force for the brigade after a relatively 
 uneventful move it was off to the field for sub unit training before the brigade exercise after becoming accustomed to 
 the unusually balmy weather the training began in earnest a company participated with the fly boys on airmobile operations b 
 and c companies practiced mounted winter tactics and recce platoon disappeared on their skidoos to practice sneak and peek tactics 
 the company and battalion exercises went well except for the quarter master who had his tent and some supplies go 
 up in flames the brigade exercise began well with b and c companies creating havoc with the brigade while a

 most of c company s carriers ran into difficulties officer commanding c company later sent in a map correction requesting

 for so many years it was also a happy time with the second battalion finally returning to germany to once 
 again take up our role as part of 4 cmbg after ch ristmas the preparations for the departu re of 
 the battalion began in earnest parades were the order of the day as the soldiers lined up for needles and 
 document checks in preparation for their departure when all was done the advance party under the command of major bill 
 sutherland departed on 1 may 1984 to prepare germany for the arrival of the patricia s over the period of 
 june to august the main body of the battalion arrived in germany with their dependants furniture and effects many of 
 the battalion members arrived with new brides making the housing officer s job a most difficult task indeed as captain 
 dave wilson can attest when all was said and done the transition proved to go more smoothly than most thought 
 it would many thanks go out to all those involved especially to 3 rcr and cfb baden soellingen whose hard 
 work made it all possible

 the early morning fog was just beginning to lift as the low distant rumble of diesel engines of apcs departing 
 the front gate of cfb baden soellingen was heard this was the beginning of ex radical patricia the first training 
 undertaken by the battalion in the german countryside after deployment by road and rail on 29 july 1984 the battalion 
 was ready to commence two weeks of intensive training in the munsingen area ex radical patricia started off with the 
 subunits 0:sub 0:units conducting section and platoon level training for the first few days this gave the platoons time to 
 hone their skills before company operations began the next phase of the training featured the companies training as integral units 
 a and b companies joined forces to practice offensive and defensive operations while c company went off and conducted manoeuvres 
 on their own throughout this time administration 0:admin 0:istration company was kept very busy keeping up with the demands of 
 the other companies while conducting training on its own during the last two days the sub units were brought together 
 under battalion control to conduct two days of battalion tactical moves by day and night during the moves recce platoon 
 and the military police were able to sharpen their traffic control skills the companies were also given the chance to 
 practice tank infantry co operation with the rcd in munsingen ex radical patricia proved to be a good opportunity for 
 the unit to have fighting skills before fallex 84 nijmegen marches whoever said that the army marches on its stomach 
 has never been on the nijmegen international marches the members of the second battalion team can truly attest to the 
 fact that it is the feet not the stomach that bears the brunt of the marching training for the marches 
 began soon after the rotation advance party arrived in germany with team captain lt brian flynn choosing his team from 
 those available at the time the mcd a mcpl j durand was kept busy tending to the sore feet and 
 blisters of the team as they practiced marching through the local countryside 0:country 0:side around the base finally the day 
 of the marches drew near and the 12 member team headed off to nijmegen the routes took the marchers over 
 surfaces 0:sur 0:faces varying from gravel to pavement and everything in between each surface having its own distinctive method of 
 torturing already sore feet this however was more than compensated for by the evening festive activities and the cheers and 
 friendliness of the dutch people lining the route like all good things the marches came to an end those tired 
 and foot sore members of the team were glad to return home to soak their feet vowing never to march

 36 fallex 84 fallex is the culmination of the training year in which the units put into practice the various 
 skills learned throughout that period except for a few veterans and the members of a company this was the first 
 time that members of the battalion had been on an exercise of this magnitude during the first week of training 
 in hohenfels the subunits were left on their own in the military training area mta while battalion 0:bat 0:talion headquarters 
 and administration company stayed in camp to provide administrative support the battalion kept a high profile during the hohenfels concentration 
 a company went through the chemical decontamination demonstration run for the benefit of the brigade officers while b company staged 
 an excellent combat team attack for the visiting land forces command and staff college at the end of the first 
 week the battalion was pulled back into camp for some much needed rest and maintenance even the invisible support weapons 
 platoons showed up mortar platoon returned from their gun camp with 1 rcha in grafenwohr and recce platoon pulled in 
 its patrol detachments from wherever they had been hiding ex rampant patricia at midnight sunday 2 september the battalion rolled 
 out of camp to commence ex rampant patricia this was going to be the dry run for the battle group 
 in preparation for the brigade and corps exercises dry that is except for the rain and the assault river crossings 
 by a and c companies armoured defence platoon even got out of their carriers and carried their tow launchers across 
 in the assault boats the exercise was tiring but proved to be a valuable learning experience for the battalion with 
 the end of the week came the end of the exercise as manoeuvre is restricted on weekends for the last 
 time the battalion returned to hohenfels for a hot meal hot shower and a last night under a solid roof 
 before the brigade and corps exercises ex solo passage throughout the weekend a steady rain threatened to force a delay 
 in or cancellation of the brigade exercise however at midnight 9 september the exercise was a go and the brigade 
 rolled out of hohenfels for the last time it proved to be a fast moving exercise with much excitement from 
 start to finish the battalion took the lead from the start and advanced towards the brigade objectives the german troops 
 acting as the enemy tried their best to halt the advance their efforts were to no avail as they quickly 
 found themselves outflanked by our dismounted troops the assault river crossing operation in which the battalion was involved proved to 
 be a success even though one of the companies decided to take a round about route to their objective by 
 the end of the exercise everyone was exhausted and the vehicles and equipment were in need of maintenance after a 
 six hour train move the battalion moved into an assemby area to prepare for the corps exercise prepare to move

 ex flinker igel exercise flinker igel speedy hedgehog was the major field exercise for 11 german corps and the second 
 battalion was part of the orange force which included the first ge mountain division and 4 cmbg they were tasked 
 with invading blue land by doing an assault river crossing and advancing to seize a prominent piece of high ground 
 although the exercise was the most demanding of the fallex series it also proved to be the most interesting the 
 battalion attacked against a determined and ever present enemy a fact that kept the battalion continually on their toes the 
 exercise kept the battalion on the move 25 hours a day whether it was crossing rivers or chasing after the 
 marders and panzers of the blue force by the end of the exercise exhaustion had set in and the troops 
 were in need of rest the battalion was moved to an assembly area for a brief clean up before deploying

 45 third battalion by second lieutenant j m meikle 3rd battalion shows the navy that army can handle assault boats 
 during an army and navy competition holding true to form 3 ppcli enjoyed a very active and prosperous 1984 participating 
 in a various number of exercises and exchanges the year started with a deep chill the battalion traded the flowers 
 of victoria for the frozen waste lands of wainwright to take part in ex rapier thrust 84 which wasal cbg 
 defensive exercise along with the normal winter warfare training live fire defensive exercises were also conducted the most memorable event 
 of the exercise was the battalion s 21 hour redeployment by highway this was due to fog on vancouver island 
 and vancouver which did not permit aircraft to land for several days the battalion did however arrive for the annual 
 flower count february and march distinguished themselves with pcf courses being conducted brigade officer study week and the biathlon team 
 capturing the 1 cbg team trophy and the collin trophy the team was well prepared to compete in the fmc 
 championship and placed second overall the month of april once again saw the battalion moving out of victoria the majority 
 of the battalion deployed to waincon 84 b company taking the lead in order to train d company canadian scottish 
 regiment a company left last deploying to camp pendleton to train with 1 bn 3 marine division for six weeks 
 and participating in an amphibious exercise in addition a composite platoon under comd of lieutenant eac wrighte was sent to 
 australia on exchange with 8 9 battalion royal australian regiment they took part in jungle warfare training in canungra tully 
 and also paraded for anzac day during waincon 84 the battalion was supplemented with l coy 1 3 marines and 
 6 p 1 b coy 8 9 rar and several marine observers from 29 palms who were studying the employment 
 of the avgp the battalion began the concentration emphasizing the shoot to live program to check the small arms training 
 a falling plate competition was held which somehow was won by the aussies then c company on behalf of the 
 battalion put on a superb weapons effect demonstration for the brigade next all the rifle companies participated in an attack 
 and defence field firing exercise from section to combat team level the marines and australians did extremely well although it 
 was their first exposure to the grizzly waincon 84 also permitted the marines and aussies to sample a bit of 
 canadian culture with trips to calgary banff jasper and edmonton and five days leave when we eventually returned to victoria 
 the pace did not slacken on return to victoria because the battalion was tasked to provide honour guards for general 
 george pearkes state funeral soon after the battalion hit the parade square in preparation for the freedom of the municipality 
 of esquimalt on 30 june 1984 after the parade the battalion proceeded on well deserved block leave after block leave 
 the rifle companies each spent a week on the ranges in nanaimo and a week at a basic mountain school 
 run by recce platoon during the same time frame the battalion prepared forthe papal visit in vancouver five hundred men 
 from the battalion supplemented by 270 militia lined the streets in and near vanier park on 18 september 1984 in 
 oct nov 1984 the fall pcf cycle was conducted a platoon was attached to 1 ppcli for ex mm7 in 
 suffield and preparation forthe battalion patrolling competition began the patrolling competition was conducted in early december in nanaimo lakes area 
 it consisted of a recce patrol culminating in a fighting patrol b company swept both trophies with mcpl mccracken winning 
 the recce patrol and 2nd lieutenant bob saunders capturing the fighting patrol finally the year s training came to an 
 end with the traditional men s christmas dinner and everyone departing for christmas leave although 1984 was a rewarding and 
 profitable year many officers and men wondered what it would be like if the complete battalion was allowed to deploy 
 together perhaps in 1985 we shall find the complete battalion in wainwright during rvbs 
 46 the corps of drums pte kelly grows six inches while on parade the corps of drums entertains the battalion 
 and their families after the freedom of the city parade the corps of drums marches on drumllne struts their stuff 
 with a little stick drill what s that sound exclaimed several of the prominent citizens of esquimau it seems to 
 be the faint strains of drums and bugles a sound some six years previous familiar to all residents in the 
 area yes indeed it was for early in august 1983 wo smyth was summoned by his commanding officer and given 
 the task of forming a corps of drums word spread throughout the battalion that lieutenant colonel mcmurray had authorized a 
 corps of drums to be formed and that those with musical background wishing to apply for a position should do 
 so within days the numbers grew to 30 however it should be noted that the musical background of those applicants 
 was limited a plan was devised to overcome this obstacle and an intense period of training was undertaken in just 
 three months the corps of drums entertained the colonel of the regiment on his visit to work point and shortly 
 after their civilian debut took place in winnipeg as part of the farewell salute to the city of winnipeg by 
 second battalion ppcli since then the corps of drums of third battalion ppcli have performed on several occasions in victoria 
 and were selected for an engagement at the provincial tattoo in new brunswick the most recent of their performances took 
 place in the royal theatre in victoria where they performed for a packed house and received the admiration of such 
 dignitaries as the mayor of victoria commander cfb esquimau and many others the corps of drums look forward to the

 50 children from the pearkes clinic on the twelfth of october a group of small children from the george pearkes 
 clinic visited the third battalion princess patricia s canadian light infantry the visit was organized for two reasons first and 
 foremost it was designed to give the children an interesting and exciting day by allowing them to see and do 
 things not normally available to them secondly the visit provided an opportunity for the soldiers of the battalion to see 
 some of the people who are aided by the united way the visit by the pearkes clinic had a special 
 significance to the battalion as the majority of the battalion s united way contributions have traditionally gone to the pearkes 
 clinic the children arrived at 1000 hrs and were taken directly to a display put on by the machinegun course 
 they were able to examine both the gpmg and the 50 caihmg and had an opportunity to fire the gpmg 
 with blank ammunition they were then shown a command post vehicle and a 2v4 ton truck most of the children 
 were then taken for a ride in the 2vi ton truck while instructors from the driver wheeled course were available 
 to answer any questions next they were shown a display put on by recce platoon which included a selection of 
 small arms and a sniper fully camouflaged they then went on to what they considered the high point of the 
 tour the display of a grizzly and an mll3 apc combined with the opportunity to go for a short ride 
 in these vehicles made this portion of the tour the most popular with the vehicle rides the tour officially ended 
 the children were then taken to the officers mess where they had a light snack prepared by the mess staff 
 although the weather was less than desirable the children definitely enjoyed themselves and hope to return on another tour special 
 thanks are extended to the courses and platoons which set up the displays and made the children s visit an 
 enjoyable and exciting experience mcpl ford explains the workings of a gpmg to one of the cpl mullln watches as

 56 2 airborne commando captain s m bryan the year just completed was certainly a busy one for 2 commando 
 it started with the now famous infamous round lake massacre roared through the summer with the airborne tournament and the 
 change of command and finished off with ex pegasus strike a low level winter training exercise february saw the unit 
 participating in ex lightning strike a special service force ssf controlled winterexercise in earlton ontario the commando jumped in seized 
 the local airfield which was established as the brigade airhead and then moved to secure the town of earlton itself 
 the towns people were really helpful and many a night was spent out of the cold in the basements of 
 warm hearted locals following the regimental and brigade level training in february the month of march was available for training 
 at the commando level warrant officer doug westacott ran a week long demolition camp which proved to be excellent training 
 the only administrative 0:adminis 0:trative drawback was the continual shortage of cigarettes at least on the part of spinner the 
 demolition week was followed by two weeks of survival and escape and evasion training the major problem was a series 
 of stomach ailments probably as a result of eating too much pizza and heat prostration caused by overly warm apartments 
 perhaps it should have been called fighting in built up area training 2 commando pro vides a soldier with a 
 different view of the world colonel sutherland receiving a demonstration of bondage techniques the months of may and june were 
 occupied by petcon and preparations for the airborne tournament congratulations are in order to captain tom stinson and 7 platoon 
 for winning the ssf patrol competition the tournament and its preparatory period took much time and effort except for captain 
 mickey mouse mcdonough and master corporal brian two pin toupin no sooner had the tournament finished and the unit changed 
 its commanding officer in a brief ceremony on the dz following a jump major ron bragdon took command from major 
 pat dillon all ranks of the commando extended best wishes to the outgoing commanding officer as he moved down the 
 road to ottawa following a much needed block leave period the commando was able to warmly welcome its new members 
 via the airborne indoctrination course once again the commando was tasked to conduct this course on behalf of the regiment 
 surely what can provide a more friendly encounter during one s first days in the regiment than to be peering 
 down at sgt jerry topham s smiling face while you are hanging in the flight simulator the highlights of fallcon 
 were the victory of 2 commando s march and shoot team during the ssf competition and the fine placing of 
 trooper chris edwards and corporal chris ratcliffe on the brigade ironman competition 3rd and 6th respectively co 2cdo major r 
 p bragdon exits a c 130 note the twists the result of a poor exit the winning 2 cdo entry

 57 october afforded the commando an opportunity to send a 40 man platoon group to wainwright to participate in a 
 joint exercise with the airborne platoon from the loyal edmonton regiment ex burma rig demonstrated the dedication of airborne soldiers 
 indeed corporals mark mayne and devon ritchie gave up the chance to attend the social function in camp in order 
 to further appreciate the scenic beauty of the training area the fall period also saw the completion of the course

 corporal john plantz iscc trooper steve mitchell patrol pathfinder and trooper ernie augot tow it has been said that much

 usual array of social functions and with ex pegasus strike a commando level winter exercise which consists of para insertion

 1984 with a full load as the ytep courses of 1983 finished their training and the winter leadership courses started 
 up we expected fewer tq3 platoons for the fall and winter of 84 85 and so agreed to additional leadership 
 courses to maintain a steady rate of training when we returned from block leave in july we found that nine 
 tq3 courses had been activated for the fall and winter period these added to the previously planned leadership courses made 
 the fall training period much busierthan originally planned many fellow patricias were welcomed back for a four month tour as

 march 1978 and opened a business in the town of wainwright he passed away in february 1984 after a short 
 illness mrs wilkes approached the battle school to make a presentation in memory of her husband as the marksmanship trophy 
 which had been presented by the loyal edmonton regiment was full it was decided to make this presentation a replacement 
 marksmanship trophy brigade headquarters provided an antique rifle that had been a trophy in years past which had fallen into 
 disuse and forwarded it to the battle school mrs wilkes with the assistance of capt paul hale worked with the 
 tradesmen of camp wainwright and the town to refurbish and mount the new trophy this type of rifle first entered 
 british army service in 1858 as a muzzle loading enfield in response to technological advances existing stocks were converted to 
 snider enfields a breech loading adaptation many of these converted rifles were shipped to the canadian militia to provide arms 
 to counter the fenian raids of 1865 1866 variations were used by all canadian militia units as well as the 
 north west mounted police until 1875 in 1905 many were converted to carbines for cadet use a short history of 
 the actual weapon in the trophy has been put together based on a study of its markings and what little 
 has been written of its previous service it was made in 1860 converted shortly after and probably came to canada 
 as part of the first shipment where it is thought to have been used by the queen s own rifles 
 of canada in toronto during the 19605 the rifle was on display at at regular force battalion of theqor of 
 c and may have been a regimental trophy in 1970 with the reduction of the regular force component of the 
 qor of c the rifle was presented to 1 combat group where it was used as a brigade trophy for 
 inter unit competition until it fell into disuse in february 1984 it was sent to the battle school where it 
 was refurbished and re presented through the auspices of mrs wilkes if anyone knows more about the history of the 
 rifle they are requested to inform the battle school adjutant with the fall section commanders courses 8404 and 8405 the 
 battle school welcomed third battalion the royal canadian regiment to the brigade both courses had a mix of regiments as 
 instructors and students there was some apprehension as we launched this experiment but the results were excellent a friendly regimental 
 rivalry was maintained which did not interfere with learning from each other s experiences and which resulted in some minor 
 pranks one warrant officer now checks his slipons 0:slip 0:ons hourly to ensure that no one has changed them for

 canadian forces officer candidate 0:can 0:didate school or on retirement have pursued second careers in the local community the past

 at one of our staff mess dinners equally we were fortunate to have major steve brodsky ret d as the 
 guest speaker during the staff s annual professional study day his address on the nature of military professionalism was not 
 only interesting but also provocative which resulted in a lengthy question and answer period he will also return in 1985 
 as one of many keynote speakers who will address the officer indoctrination course which is the major commissioned from the

 1984 included sending sgt palmer and sgt leduc on their tq6b course both did very well and we understand that 
 they have since been promoted congratulations to both of them also worthy of note is that csm bannister and captraz 
 won the rifle and pistol shoots respectively during the cfocs staff skill at arms competition it looks as though 1985 
 is going to prove to be another busy year in chilliwack even though we are not on regimental duty ppcli

 is to report any unusual or suspicious military activity within their area of responsibility they also provide excellent information on 
 local conditions to regular force or reserve units which may visit their areas the duty of administering this programme has 
 been extremely satisfying one of the highlights in the last few years has been the recognition of canadian ranger service

 the past year was one of diverse activity and great accomplishment 0:accom 0:plishment for the regimental band whether it was 
 playing for mess dinners making a new record or performing a memorial ceremony on vimy ridge we were involved from 
 calgary to winnipeg to yellowknife or brussels we helped to make the p p c l i name better known 
 much of march and april was spent in the recording studio making our latest album called over the top this 
 record is a collection of vocal and instrumental favourites from world wars i and 11 featured on the record are 
 a number of songs by a barbershop quartet led by base deputy commander colonel h g leitch cd the album

 cyprus in march a four day jaunt up to yellowknife as part of armed forces week celebrations and a military 
 tattoo in winnipeg with 2 ppcli at the end of may on the way to winnipeg the band made a 
 side trip to williston north dakota there we took part in their annual band day festival july was a busy 
 month in which we played a canada day concert on prince s island here in calgary followed by an armed 
 forces day parade at currie barracks then it was off to great falls montana for the 4th of july parade 
 a quick trip back to calgary got us back on time for the calgary stampede parade and a number of 
 stampede concerts in the big 4 building on the grounds not long after the stampede we began rehearsals for the 
 1 cbg change of command parade a few days later representatives from all the major units in 1 cbg witnessed 
 brigadier general j l sharpe cd hand over the reigns of command to brigadier general c milner omm cd of 
 all the change of command parades done by the band last year none was as important to us as the 
 change of command which took place within our own unit we had the pleasure last august of welcoming captain jean 
 pierre montminy as our new director of music he replaced captain r swaneveld who is now training officers at the 
 canadian forces school of music in victoria chief warrant officer j kopsteln cd assistant director of music captain montminy brings 
 to the band a wealth of experience he has been in the band branch since 1955 and a director of 
 music since 1975 as a director of music he has held appointments with the r c r band in gagetown 
 and the royal 22nd band in quebec city prior to his calgary posting captain montminy held the position of dc 
 2 2 in ottawa so in addition to his musical expertise his knowledge of protocol has already proven to be 
 a welcome asset he says that he is happy to be out from behind the desk and back in front 
 of a band again we in turn are very happy to have him on the podium as our new director 
 of music also new to the band last year was chief warrant officer jack kopstein who arrived in august from 
 ottawa s central band a musician arranger and administrator he too brings thirty years of experience in the band trade 
 therefore his transition into his new position as our assistant director of music has been very smooth our former assistant 
 director of music chief warrant officer brian gossip is now at cfsmus in victoria there was one retirement from the 
 band in 84 clarinetist and saxophonist sergeant bob seton after a twenty five year career spent exclusively with the ppcli 
 band has now joined the civilian rank and file his plans are to go to the university of calgary and 
 study computer programming and continue his playing in the band of the king s own calgary regiment good luck bob 
 the new management had little choice but to jump into ppcli band life with both feet when we returned from 
 summer leave in september we started off immediately by preparing all the necessities for our trip to europe in october 
 this included concert music parade music final booking arrangements and all the last minute details involved with public relations obviously 
 experience pays off because everything was accomplished on schedule and everyone managed to keep on smilin through it all finally 
 on october 19 we made our escape from the early winter of snowbound calgary and began ourfive week european tour 
 through the medium of parades mess dinners and public concerts we displayed the ppcli name in countries such as belgium 
 germany and france the focus of the trip was on the annual memorial ceremony which takes place at vimy ridge 
 there on november 4th as well as in concert at the casino concert hall in arras we received great acclaim 
 from all who attended department of veteran s affairs who arranged the trip also organized public concerts in 
 73 ghent and knokke heistin belgium an integral part of ceremonies commemorating the 40th anniversary of the liberation of europe 
 these concerts were also enthusiastically received the trip included its fair share of parades and mess dinners in lahr in 
 baden and at shape headquarters it was a busy time with a lot of travel but we feel it was 
 very successful from the point of view of regimental public relations in europe all in all 1984 stands out as 
 a year in which we as the regimental band of the ppcli can take pride our accomplishments 0:accom 0:plishments in

 the opportunity of meeting with old friends from the regimental family from all aspects the edmonton branch is alive and 
 flourishing under the able guidance of president gordon homes and vice president arthur potts i wish them continued success mid 
 november i attended the meeting of the regimental guard in ottawa and was most impressed at the depth of their 
 deliberations 0:deli 0:berations under the chairmanship of brigadier general john sharpe the guard discussed many points of regimental concern and 
 to be privy to their discussions was indeed an honour and privilege for me although time did not permit a 
 visit with the ottawa branch i was able to discuss some association matters with our vice president east lloyd swick 
 and with our honourary colonel colonel w b s sutherland on return from ottawa and a laundry stop i was 
 then off to victoria to participate in ric a dam doo 84 hosted by lieutenant colonel merv mcmurray and the 
 officers of our third battalion it was an enjoyable experience to return to work point barracks where i had served 
 some twenty years before i was also able to attend the regular monthly meeting of the victoria branch and found 
 them to be in good strength and growing and making plans for our 75th anniversary the response to our anniversary

 78 the royal green jackets first battalion commanding officer lieutenant colonel cclo owen mvo obe in november 1983 the battalion 
 returned from northern ireland to tidworth england and is now undergoing an extensive three phase training programme designed to meet 
 the operational requirements of our new role in ist infantry brigade the united kingdom mobile force this training will culminate 
 in september with exercise bold gannet a brigade exercise in denmark the best possible preparation for our tour in the 
 falkland islands for which we embark at the end of the year phase 1 of the training programme concentrated on 
 individual section and platoon training and company commanders had opportunities to exercise and test their commands on their own exercises 
 milan atgw and mortar cadres were run companies exercised in support of the school of infantry s commanders courses and 
 our commanders were subjected to a most successful and illuminating two day exercise on the bovington battle group trainer where 
 we tested our battle procedures a battalion exercise and the deployment of battalion headquarters and two companies to raf greenham 
 common to guard the american cruise missile base in a cold wet week in january ensured that the early part 
 of 1984 was an exceptionally active period for us all phase 2 of our training began after easter leave with 
 a battalion defence exercise on salisbury plain and continued with the running of a number of specialist cadres including the 
 jnco cadre an essential first step on the promotion ladder for riflemen then brigade command post exercises a battalion shooting 
 week a further company deployment to greenham another company to act as enemy to help 42 commando train for their 
 impending tour of rural operations in northern ireland live firing exercises for the mortar anti tank and recce platoons and 
 snocat driver training in preparation for the falklands meant that our second phase training began as phase one had ended 
 most hectically the battalion s shooting team shot extremely well at the south west district skill at arms meeting saam 
 in may when they won the major unit championship at a district meeting for the third successive year individual champion 
 at this meeting cpl m frape went on to become the champion at arms at the south west united services 
 saam in june beating all comers from the royal navy royal marines royal air force and army a considerable 0:con 
 0:siderable personal achievement in may too we sent a strong contingent to celle in west germany for the queen s 
 visit to the regiment exercised our rights to the freedom of high wycombe sent 25 men on a free fall 
 parachute course and entertained 600 official and regimental guests to a joint sounding of retreat with the 3rd battalion the 
 light infantry phase 3 will start when the battalion returns from summer leave and will take the battalion up to 
 exercise bold gannet our attention will be concentrated in this period on our final preparations for the ftx but we 
 intend also to complete specialist training for the falkland islands the battalion has continued to enjoy itself in other fields 
 in december 1983 and january this year on an expedition to spain a party of riflemen drawn from the ist 
 and 3rd battalions retraced the 500 kilometre route taken by the light brigade during their heroic rearguard action in support 
 of sir john moore s army in the retreat to corunna in 1808 dressed in rifle brigade uniforms of the 
 period marching over some rough terrain and in some times appalling conditions the riflemen achieved not only their aim but 
 to their astonishment were the object of quite unexpected admiration from and popularity amongst the spanish along their route and 
 attracted extensive media coverage in both spain and england our sports teams have entered a wide range of army competitions 
 from cricket to coarse fishing with considerable 0:con 0:siderable success the football and hockey team did well to reach the 
 semi finals in their infantry cup matches and the boxing team reached the finals of the uklf novices intermediate championships 
 we look forward to the challenge that the remainder of the year will surely bring confident that we have succeeded 
 in meeting those we set ourselves and were given in the first half of 1984 it looks set to be 
 a memorable year second battalion commanding officer lieutenant colonel jpo beddard mbe we began the year in earnest with two 
 weeks of winter warfare in soltau it was as always extremely cold but the riflemen set to with enthusiasm a 
 lot of emphasis had previously been laid on shelters and survival and one group of individuals on a twenty kilometre 
 night march were so enthusiastic they set up their shelter within a thousand metres of the start and stayed therefor 
 36 hours the battalion improved its sporting record in boxing and skiing at the beginning of the year the boxing 
 team were the runners up in the 4 armd div novices boxing competition and defeated the previously all conquering 10 
 rct on the way the skiing team although declining to compete seriously in the langlauf as being unsightly did very 
 well in the alpine section to reach the finals of the army cup winning the daily telegraph cup in the 
 process after this reasonably ordered start to the year the pace moved into double time at the end of block 
 leave in april the battalion carried out field firing at sennelager and during this we managed to test the fire 
 fighting facilities of the centre to the full the words take a smoke break took on a whole new meaning 
 but miraculously no one was hurt following a few days after that we were part of a demonstration for the 
 tri service staff college also at sennelager with meticulous planning and rehearsal this went off extremely well and all the 
 spectators were impressed with the display all this was achieved in atrocious conditions of monsoon proportions 
 79 immediately after this the battalion with armour in tow not always metaphorically moved to celle forthe regimental visit of 
 the colonel in chief our main contribution was a spectacular battle group attack mounted by a and c companies with 
 a squadron rsdg as their armour against a dug in b company harrier ground attack fighters thundered in and after 
 the carnage her majesty inspected both the victors and the vanquished she also officially started a courageous six marathon team 
 running 97 kilometres each from celle to the 4th battalion in davies street in london this combined strength with charity 
 and raised a sizeable sum for cancer research afterwards the crowds thronged the wake of her majesty as she toured 
 the numerous stands and displays in trenchard barracks home of the 3rd battalion and for a while at least the 
 sun shone a mere two weeks later we were off again to soltau for more field training a and c 
 companies joined into 3 rtr battle group for pre batus training which left d company with one squadron to get 
 on with their own training and to act as enemy during this period a new trial trench system dug by 
 d company demonstrated its worth as the attacking forces who were looking for it will testify in the sporting aspect 
 of life during this period the battalion enjoyed more success the sailing team won the light division regatta and look 
 set to do well in the infantry and army cups the football team did extremely well and after a long 
 series of gruelling matches clinched the 4th armoured division football cup in an exciting final proving that experience is all 
 captain bright won the senior divisional orienteering and almost singlehandedly gained the battalion a creditable seventh place in the league 
 the diving club managed to overcome the eccentricities and on occasion downright banditry of the italian customs services and sent 
 a twenty two man expedition to the island of elba for three weeks itwas remarked that the mediterranian in april 
 is not the hottest of climes the pace will continue at speed until the autumn with exercise medicine man happening 
 soon in canada for a and c companies and exercise lionheart on which the whole battalion will deploy to practise 
 our war role along with the rest of the corps and some 50 000 reinforcements from united kingdom land forces

 firing training during this time the bisley team returned from england having won the baor shield for being the highest 
 placed baor major unit after leave in august the battalion took part in exercise eternal triangle the ist armoured division 
 ftx the weather was extremely kind throughout the three weeks of the exercise and all phases of war were practised 
 including an assault minefield crossing we were visited by three journalists during the exercise one of whom was robert fox 
 of falklands fame christmas leave was taken locally by the battalion the most notable of the festivities was the battalion 
 revue which consisted of a series of humourous sketches these included one in which the commanding officer and regimental sergeant 
 major sang that well known duet no two people have ever been so in love and suitably outfitted for tennis 
 as a courting couple of the 1920s they brought the house down new year saw the start of individual training 
 cadres followed by a number of different exercises this really kept the battalion busy until easter april up until the 
 24th may saw the preparations for a visit of her majesty the queen our colonel in chief to the regiment 
 in germany the battalion had been chosen as the base forthe visit it was a great family occasion with contingents 
 of riflemen and their families from the other battalions as well as old comrades attending the colonel in chief saw 
 a battlegroup attack organized 0:or 0:ganized by the 2nd battalion inspected a guard of honour found by the battalion and 
 watched a presentation of the rifleman of the eighties performed by i company the 1 st and 4th battalions provided 
 static displays the visit culminated in a dinner in the officers mess for one hundred and eighty officers and their 
 wives june this year has been very wet and we have been training in earnest for a four and a 
 half month northern ireland tour later this year her majesty the queen colonel in chief royal green jackets inspecting the 
 guard of honour accompanied by field marshal sir edwin bramall cds colonel commandant 3rgj and the guard commander major pd

 80 fourth volunteer battalion commanding officer lieutenant colonel cjp miers 1983 continued with the emphasis on baor camp was held 
 over the last fortnight of october for g company it got off to an interesting start as they discovered at 
 lyneham that all their weapons had been sent by an over zealous raf flight sergeant on an aircraft taking another 
 battalion to kenya and were at the time of discovery somewhere over the south of france so g company were 
 a little late joining the battalion for the five day brigade work up period exercise zodiac muster the commanding 0:com 
 0:manding officer had told the brigade commander that he was quite happy for the battalion to be thrown in at 
 the deep end on this since pressure from the word go was the best way of getting us into top 
 gear this certainly proved to be the case the battalion moved off in a convoy of some 70 vehicles including 
 24 tcvs with rct drivers on the sunday morning to the exercise area in the leine valley between then and 
 thursday night we were given a series of offensive tasks in rapid succession securing the brigade start line seizing bridges 
 in coup de main operations manning opsd on a river line exploiting the brigade bridgehead and clearing woods beyond it 
 and finally putting in a full scale heliborne attack on the kosb in the sibesse gap we seemed to be 
 constantly on the move by night and day on foot in tcvs and slung it was an exhilarating experience not 
 only because sions by chinook helicopters with vehicles underwe were given such interesting and demanding tasks ourselves but also because 
 we saw so much of the tanks and apcs of the brigade as they rumbled through and around our positions 
 csgt bates wasn t so impressed however as one tank ran over his smg and converted it into an unrecognizable 
 heap of metal over the middle week end of camp we stayed at our transit accommodation with 1 kings atosnabruck 
 for the sergeants this was the wives club an interesting venue a bus load of riflemen visited hanover and more 
 went to hamburg rumour has it that lcpl taylor once an olympic boxer for great britain and a familiar figure 
 as a regimental policeman on the steps of 56 davies street went on stage at one of the osnabruck night 
 clubs this must have been a startling if not a star performance the final five days of camp were spent 
 on exercise eternal triangle in which the 4th armoured division attacked the ist armoured division we occupied a defensive position 
 based on the village of haarbruck not far from holzminden on the river weser by coincidence itwasinthevillageof haarsbruck nearly the 
 same name but in france that the bucks battalion was finally overrun after much hard fighting in 1940 our haarbruck 
 was the scene of a battle between the americans and the germans in the closing stages of the war battalion 
 headquarters and c company were in the village and a b and g companies were in outlying woods supported by 
 the milan platoon and the mortars on the third day we had a tremendous battle in which the enemy the 
 black watch supported by the tanks of the scots dragoon guards were delayed much longer than the pink said they 
 should have been we don t think the fact that officers of 2rgj were the umpires had anything to do 
 with this but we know that those enemy forces unable to get onto our high ground were bound to go 
 through 3rgj who were our nearest neighbours to make sure that 4rgj understood the need for offensive action the brigade 
 commander had us finish our participation in exercise eternal triangle with a battalion attack 1983 was rounded off with the 
 usual festivities and the battalion entered 1984 again aimed a boar in february the headquarterselementtookpartin exercise zodiac challenge where due 
 to an oversight on the movements staff they were forced to use the brigade commanders apc and command landrover they 
 were certainly well equipped in may over twenty members of battalion headquarters took part in exercise hurst park the ist 
 armoured division test cpx there they acted as the lower control for the 12th armoured brigade playing the role of 
 all four battle groups in the brigade quite a daunting prospect the following week saw a cross section of thirty 
 members of the battalion from all companies plus six of their wives in celle for the queen s visit this 
 was an outstanding success and all of them were introduced to her majesty the light division depot winchester commanding officer 
 lieutenant colonel pg chamberlin the depot has now settled down into its new role and we are becoming used to 
 the title it is now rare for someone to refer to the rifle depot and most green jackets are becoming 
 used to seeing the inkerman whistle and chain of the light infantry sergeants on parade the boom in recruiting has 
 continued with the most recent platoon forming up at one hundred men including the staff the platoon commander lieutenant ted 
 evelegh has been trying to claim pay of higher rank before the inevitable wastage process takes its toll and the 
 numbers become more manageable we now wear the new combat boot on parade and have had a mixed success at 
 bulling the unbullable boot we dream of receiving the new sabo rifle but meanwhile make do with the super sock 
 novices boxing has become a major feature of depot life with a match between the intermediary platoons every six weeks 
 in order to boost the support given to the opposing teams a number of charming local girls have provided some 
 interesting inter round mammaries the passing out parade is another feature of depot life and we have had many distinguished 
 guests and friends as inspecting officers these have included brigadier koe the mayor of winchester 0:win 0:chester lieutenant colonel lyddon 
 and brigadier satish nambiar from the indian high commission we are now entering the summer season and the pace of

 o development and consolidation the operational deployment force based in townsville north queensland was once again tested by the annual 
 deployment exercise and the constant effort required to keep 1 rar and 2 4 rar equipped trained and ready to 
 fulfill their role in the odf ensured a busy year for them the parachute capability of 3 rar was further 
 developed and tested on exercise meanwhile 5 7 rar gained further expertise in its new role as a mechanized battalion 
 and the two brisbane based battalions continued to be employed as standard infantry battalions 2nd 4th battalion 1984 began in 
 earnest for 2 4 rar with drafts of new arrivals being sent to the field force battle school at tully 
 north queensland for an introduction to jungle warfare as the wet season was very wet this year tully was in 
 prime condition providing a beautiful if damp backdrop for the rigours of soldiering in the jungle throughout the months of 
 february and march the battalion conducted training courses for mortars support weapons assault pioneers and signals as well as promotion 
 courses for corporal ist battalion the major task of 1 rar in 1984 was that of priority operational deployment force 
 battalion of the 3rd brigade many hours were spent on maintaining the battalion s operational readiness state and many exercises 
 were conducted throughout the year to ensure it could fulfill this demanding role the battalion was finally put to the 
 test in the annual odf deployment exercise swift eagle which involved the entire odf group deploying by air to the

 undertook exercise wantok warrior which was a three week exchange exercise with 2nd battalion the royal pacific islands regiment of 
 papua new guinea and in septemberc company departed forathreemonth tourof duty at butterworth air base in malaysia the highlight of 
 the ceremonial year was the celebration of the 16th anniversary of the battle of fire support base coral in south 
 vietnam this was the first occasion the regimental colour had been paraded displaying the new battle honours mentioned in the 
 patrician of 1983 sport as always played an important part throughout the year and 1 rar once again won the 
 brigade australian rules football competition and were runners up in the field hockey and athletics competitions the battalion ended 1984 
 on a high note by winning for the second consecutive year the prestigious brigade military skills trophy involving competition in 
 crosscountry running pistol and rifle shooting and orienteering in april b company departed for hawaii and exercise pacific bond 84

 through the kahuku ranges coa ist sth spent many hours on the ranges as well as participating in battalion sporting 
 competitions 0:compe 0:titions and were on hand for anzac day both groups were able to do some sightseeing which rounded 
 off an enjoyable exchange in early june exercise spartan challenge saw the battalion despatched by truck to a start point 
 for a 90 km march to mingela west of townsville the majority of movement was by night and the exercise 
 culminated in the scaling of the liechardt ranges escarpment to enable the battalion to move into an fup for an 
 attack on the vehicles waiting to return to townsville sport became the focus of attention during june and july and 
 2 4 rar emerged as brigade rugby and volleyball champions apart from participating in the 3rd brigade exercise northern warrior

 to 2 4 rar and the laying up of the old colours in the lavarack barracks chapel the governor general

 82 3rd battalion 1984 has seen the usual busy round of exercises support tasks and further development of the parachute 
 capability the year commenced early for all sections commanders who were handed over to the rsm for a two week 
 workup exercise which despite the wet weather proved to be invaluable as a basis for the platoon and company training 
 which followed in february exercise falcons revenge in march provided c company with its first test as a parachute company 
 the exercise consisted of a daylight operational jump followed by three days training in the buladela state forest north of 
 newcastle the major lesson learned from this activity was that an operational drop zone bears little resemblance to a training 
 drop zone the brigade command post exercise conducted in may heralded the opening of the tourist season with an american 
 contingent arriving for the cpx and shortly after b company departing for a tour of duty in malaysia not to 
 be outdone battalion headquarters and elements from all companies departed for hawaii in june to participate in exercise tropic lightning

 trophy 1985 will continue to provide many and varied challenges as 3 rar continues to develop as the parachute force 
 of the australian army sth 7th battalion june 1984 provided the turning point in the history of 5 7 rar 
 as it was in that month that the approval was obtained for the battalion to become fully mechanized as opposed 
 to the previously mechanized company groups during 1984 significant resources were devoted to the equipping training and exercising of 5 
 7 rar as a mechanized battle group and the highlight of the training year was the conduct of exercise stealthy

 with ist battalion the green howards battalion headquarters were lucky enough to take part in two overseas command post exercises 
 one in hawaii and the other in new zealand with the expansion of the battalion s mechanized capability there was 
 an obvious need for courses to qualify people for their role as mechanized infantry section and vehicle commanders promotion courses 
 for corporal and unit specialist courses for support company took up what little spare time the battalion had the sporting 
 field saw success for 5 7 rar with it winning the soccer and swimming competitions and running a close second
