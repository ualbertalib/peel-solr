 nazareth penna makeshift carbine in the summer of neverthless the private trading firms in 1853 gov isaac i stevens observed
 indians were less skilled with the gun than with bows and arrows and that their gun marksmanship was not as
 good as that of men of the mountain tribes to the westward who were accustomed to use firearms in hunting
 small game at a distance in warfare as in hunting the problem of reloading proved to be a handicap to
 the efficient use of the muzzle loading gun the experienced trader and indian fighter william t hamilton claimed that he
 and a single indian companion killed five blackfoot braves during the time those indians were trying to reload fig 2

 indian browning montana that the short northwestern gun was the principal firearm of the red river half breeds as well
 as the blockfoot indians he noted the blackfoot custom of filing off a piece of the barrel leaving it but
 little longer than that of a horse pistol he characterized the north west gun as an inferior kind of shotgun
 u s gamin indian a airs annual 1854 pp 193 205 it is true that the north west smoothbore had
 neither the range nor the accuracy of the historically better known pennsylvania or kentucky rifle yet this gun did answer
 the indians demand for a firearm that was their hudson s bay flintlocks in a skirmish near fort benton in
 1865 hamilton 1907 p 607 many indians shortened their reloading time by carrying bullets in their mouths dropping them into
 the powder without any wadding and firing this shortcut enabled them to fire reload and fire four or five times
 a minute but omission of wadding further decreased both range and accuracy of fire many indian battles were fought at
 close ranges distances of 100 even 50 yards or less when they exposed themselves to gunfire in the open indians
 commonly kept moving jumping from side to side to prevent their opponents from taking accurate aim the finest illustration of
 plains indian warfare i know of is the realistic lithograph after an original drawing by carl bodmer interpreting the historic
 attack of a large force of mixed assiniboin cree upon a camp of piegan outside fort mckenzie on the missouri
 in present montana august 28 1833 the artist bodmer witnessed this action from the elevated walk behind the stockade of
 the fort his picture thus has the authenticity of a pictorial reminiscence by an observant deadly at close range light

 1850 s the hudson s bay company exchanged north west guns to the plains cree for five buffalo robes or
 three silver fox pelts denig 1952 p 57 in late years of buffalo hunting blackfoot men gave as many as
 eight to 10 robes for one of these guns it was the policy of the trading companies to restrict their
 profits on such necessities as guns and ammunition in order to encourage indian hunters to bring in larger numbers of
 valuable furs the plains indians made relatively little use of north west guns in their favorite hunt of buffalo on
 horseback few indians could reload this weapon on a fastrunning buffalo horse it was easier for them to shoot arrows
 from a bow at point blank range when chasing buffalo on horseback among the plains indians the gun was primarily
 a fighting weapon which was much used in intertribal wars and wars with the whites during the 19 th century
 however several contemporary white observers of the northwestern plains indians expressed the opinions that these fig 3 the firing mechanism

 half century with the great company one of these was the personal diary kept by donald ross chief trader at

 quickens much longer and in any case at this time there was no very particular rea his first journey to
 the west actually son to write a letter to edmonton so began in 1882 he travelled to winnipeg mr brick
 s letters from the first refer by train thence by the hudson s bay frequently to the difficulty of transmit
 company s boat to prince albert overland to the clearwater then by boat to ting news as when in one
 letter to his lake athabasca the riviere des rochers bishop he refers to his last letter from eastern canada which
 he had received and the peace to dunvegan for the next twelve years he was to live and work some
 months previously along the peace between dunvegan and my dear wife was then recovering from a somewhat severe illness of

 have had one dunvegan in 1888 meal of it i do not want to taste bacon again for a week
 when it came in i the case of souris a beaver indian and was out haying and the thompson survey
 his family was particularly striking this party were out of bacon and they came to family in the autumn of
 1886 consisted of me to borrow a bag i lent them one so father mother and four children early in

 the last child a girl of ten weighed 85 lbs and the other 79 so i am constitutionally diseased survived
 her only 36 lbs short on two bags apart from a few months after seven months of the quality and
 the short weight the price comparatively good health the poor bea 35 c is excessive ver indians were again visited
 with sickness added to the difficulty of getting supin the shape of a bad cold accompanied by plies was the
 difficulty of arranging finfever which still further reduced the scant numbers of this dying tribe and souris the ancial transactions
 through most of his much afflicted beaver was among the first stay in the west mr brick s family was
 to succumb in eastern canada for reasons of health hand in hand with sickness went star and education and he
 was faced with vation from the first the trading posts the responsibility of seeing that mrs and missions grew little
 gardens with brick had money to draw on and with potatoes and lettuce and carrots but paying his own bills
 incurred in monfrost often destroyed them supplies treal toronto winnipeg and along the went astray or ran short and if
 the trap peace river his stipend of 750 a year ping or hunting was bad at the same was credited
 to him in various places time conditions could become unbear semi annually for the most part at any able mr
 brick s first summer in the given time the bishop who held the country 1883 was particularly bad purse strings
 might be on the bering sea or in england and a letter to him might this has been a most
 unfavourable season for peace river we have had little or not reach him for months so there were no rains
 and a succession of frosts about constant financial crises and a good every three weeks the results are our crops
 part of almost every letter to the bishop particularly potatoes are poor i am be is concerned with money not
 asking for ginning to think there is little prospect of this country settling until there is some more but with
 involved requests that thing definite in regard to a railway to the money now due to him might be connect
 us with the outside world apportioned between certain distant to add to the deplorable situation persons to take care of
 transactions en mr brick continues tered into months before i sent an order to get some things i there was
 little spiritual companionreally needed this winter sent out to me ship for he rarely saw his bishop and from winnipeg
 i suppose the order has during his earlier years the only other gone into the waste paper basket anyway i
 am left without the supplies priests in the diocese were located at again for the winter of ‘ 85 mr
 brick chipewyan vermilion and lesser slave lake there was of course little material reports comfort in mr bunn s mission
 house all though we failed to get our supplies the more credit then that mr garrioch through though rather short
 we have pull can write in these terms of what haped through i decided to winter at the lake as
 we were short of provisions pened when he got as far as old wife s we have only just heard
 of the indian dis lake in 1886 with his new bride whom turbance in the saskatchewan it is a sad
 he was bringing back from england sad affair but i trust it is over before this i have some stuff
 lying at battleford at the at a little distance from the house we company s store i suppose it is
 lost as were met by mr brick who gave us all a i see from the papers that they have
 raided hearty welcome he had timed our arrival the company s post there to a nicety and he had evidently
 laid himself out to do honour to the occasion he even when supplies did get through was dressed in a
 black clerical suit which to dunvegan they were not always sat wets in creditable condition considering that isfactory he has
 been batching it for three years his hat however which was of straw bore traces of age and hard usage
 the crown that was written just about the time was rent halfway round and through the when the other four
 or five pioneer farrent there appeared a tuft of his hair in mers of dunvegan were deciding that less than
 fifteen minutes after our arrival he had us all seated at a table beneath a it was hopeless to try
 to farm in that covered stage outdoors and there he fed country and were getting ready to move us on
 the choice products of the land the out i don t know how that ‘ 84 crop farwild ducks which
 he procured from old eci but in june of ‘ 85 he is still full of wife s lake were
 done to a turn and went well with the green peas and mealy white optimism after a winter during which
 potatoes out of his garden then there were he lived mainly on rabbits the light cream made buns and fresh
 butter and lastly when it came to the my idea hers been to locate the boys at strawberries with cream
 and sugcir the lake render to them all assistance that i can to start them so as to encourage but
 this was a special occasion in other settlers there but make my headquarhonour of a bride one hundred days out
 ters here we have had a glorious from england two visiting clergy and spring it opened up early and all
 through the bishop the general picture which may and so far in june we have had plenty of rain this
 is what i have not seen in comes from the correspondence of the the springs before and we have had
 no clergy at this time is of almost unmiti frosts so far crops up to this time could not gated
 hardship both for them and for look better we have put in about 2 ½ acres their people of general
 crop wheat oats barley buckwheat peas and beans at the lake so we what was mr brick able to accomp
 shall give it a fair trial this summer lish under these limiting circumstances and there follows a paragraph which he
 was of service in two spheres the i think most clearly shows the importagricultural and the religious and it ance
 of this man s influence in early perhaps well to consider them separ northern agriculture ately in one of his
 writings j g macgregor and i am glad to say that the indians have gone right into gardening this spring
 quotes from the daily journal kept at on both sides of the river almost every fort dunvegan by mr a
 r macleod in available spot is a garden i have rendered the summer of 1806 already there were them all
 the assistance i could both by sown at the fort the seeds of carrots labour and ox help and at
 the lake we have put in marcoose s crop the man who lettuce parsley and parsnip when mr bought out
 henry mccorister place and i brick arrived at the peace then there have been down to bear lake with the
 oxen had been gardening experience dating and put in barley for an indian there so with it all i can
 assure you bertie and myback over seventy six years admittedly self have been kept busy and to me it has
 with a break in the middle he at once been a labour of love to give these indians engaged himself
 in this hazardous pur instruction in gardening and considering suit with the keenest interest he writes that some of them
 have never put in a single thing before this spring they have on april 28 1883 done well i have
 just sowed about 1 i bushels of wheat and am right into planting i hope i like the quiet pride
 of those last four to get a general little crop in i have about words however in december of that
 two acres of land but it was a mass of year 1885 he had decided that it was roots and
 will entail a great amount of la time for him to leave the country for bour to clean up theological
 and personal reasons it had alas that was a bad summer with been impossible to get his family out to
 no spring rains and frost every three stay and he was extremely unhappy weeks so mr brick s planting that
 year about the progress of his spiritual work was to come to little yet that was the he was therefore
 looking for a parish beginning of an agricultural effort that either in england or among white peowas to result in
 that famous honour at ple on the prairies although bishop chicago a few years later like a true bompas was
 trying to attract him to the pioneer he was nothing daunted by his arctic against this background he first failure
 and in december of the same wrote year he is writing we have made a fair start up at the
 lake i am purposing in the spring to plant my or at shaftesbury as i have proposed garden up here
 as early as i possibly can to name it we have three families settled then go down there to smoky
 river and there and mackenzie about 6 miles away plough and put in some little crop i but i fear
 there is little or no prospect of am ordering a portable grist mill from tor english speaking settlers coming in
 i wish onto there was our friends of the hbc make considerable capital in the way of interpret for me
 under these circumstances disparaging this part of the country for i cannot help thinking that i am spending farming purposes
 by parties leaving my time putting the society to consider in 1886 mr brick had indeed left dun able expense
 sacrificing the society of my dear family to little or no purpose you vegan but he went neither to the
 arctic cannot wonder at my feeling somewhat to the prairies nor to england but to discouraged i do like the
 country and the old wife s lake and to shaftesbury had i only a congregation to preach to i and
 on his new farm he steadily devel should be well satisfied oped his agricultural work until it fin he felt
 that the results he could show ally received international recognition were not at all commensurate with that very soon the
 question of whether or expenditure of 750 a year for his stipnot this country was really suitable for end of
 which 400 a year went directly farming became a lively political issue to mrs brick this worried him deeply in
 about 1890 mr warburton pike was and so did the fact that he could not writing something like this i
 para speak cree he constantly referred to phrase his words from memory any that deficiency and begged to be transone
 who has stood on the hills above ferred out to work among english speak peace river as i have on
 a july morn ing people yet when the bishop asked ing and seen the whole countryside him to stay he
 stayed and eleven years white with frost will realize that this after his first discouragement he was will never be
 a wheat growing coun still patiently and steadily doing his try mr brick thought differently and work although in the
 meantime his put his heart into the development of his health had completely broken and there shaftesbury farm and mr
 brick was were few tangible results to gladden his proved right heart the church could never ask for more faithful
 service from any priest but this man was not only a pioneer than she received from this disheartenfarmer sometimes i
 think his bishop ed man who fought loneliness poverty must have wondered after a silence of hunger cold illness indifference
 and months there would come to him on lake rascality to do work he was ordained athabasca or in winnipeg
 or in eng and commissioned to do there are sevland a letter in mr brick s hand and i eral
 sentences in his letters which incan imagine the bishop looking at it dicate his earnestness of purpose and wondering about
 the souls of his it is true i could find employment in children on the peace were they at farming
 but i shall never give up the last becoming interested in the christian ministry for farming faith he would open
 the letter find if i could have the biggest farm in the country i should not be satisfied unless first

 roaring of a large bull sometimes measuring six the fire driven by the wind the thunder feet at the hump
 and weighing 2 000 of the hoofs and the bellowing of the lbs a heavy growth of nearly black great
 herd made a pandemonium not hair covered the head with a long dew easily forgotten our situation was by lap
 of the same hanging below the lower no means a safe one and all turned jaw well down the neck
 this thick out and set back fires around the camp growth of hair on the head would lead by good
 luck and the continual firing one to suppose that the skull must be of our rifles we managed to turn
 the of exceptionally large proportions but buffalo away however a large number this was not the case the skull was
 not were driven in the blind rush away from much larger than that of the ordinary the fire right over
 the cutbank west of domestic animal although the bone was our camp and plunged in a bellowing slightly thicker mass
 down some hundreds of feet onto the rocky shores of the river the colour of the buffalo was uniformly the
 same a dark brown almost the fire had passed to the west by black on the head and shoulders and
 morning and some blackfeet having the body a much lighter colour it was come to our camp we went down
 by an very rarely that any difference in colour old buffalo trail to the shore of the bow was to
 be found a white buffalo was there a number of squaws had begun seen but once in a generation of
 indians to skin the dead buffalo and kill the and was considered very great medicine many with broken legs and
 otherwise having magical powers a spotted robe wounded the sight was a ghastly one would now and then be seen
 there more than a hundred animals lay in a was also what was called a silk or great pile many
 still living and the beaver robe several of which i have moaning of these poor animals was most seen they
 were a beautiful skin and pitiable the squaws and indian bucks very light the hair as fine and soft as
 were busy dragging animals off this silk the indians explained that the fine great pile and were near the bottom
 silky appearance of this was caused by as we got down to them we noticed they a stray calf being
 adopted by a band were in the act with many grunts of of buffalo and being continually licked astonishment of
 dragging out from by the different animals however this underneath what we at first thought to may be a beaver
 or silk robe was be the long talked of white buffalo very rare and when found much prized many stories
 had been told us by indians at different time since we built fort i never saw a white robe and
 few calgary in the previous year of a white white men have but on one occasion i buffalo having been
 seen by the blackthought i was most certainly on the track feet while hunting on the plains south of one
 the experience is i think worth of the bow river but the animal was relating i and a party of
 north west so swift that their fastest buffalo run mounted police were camped on the ners failed to get near
 it now we prairie south of the blackfoot crossing thought here is the animal itself and we near where the
 town of gleichen now crowded down for a good view the stands in the summer of 1876 we were animal
 as it was dragged from the pile on the track of a party of whiskey smug was undoubtedly pure white
 and we at glers who had been reported by indians first took it for a buffalo but on the to
 be in the vicinity of a large blackfoot head coming into sight it was seen to camp and somewhere above
 our en be a domestic steer and a texas at campment the banks of the bow river that having only
 one long horn the at this place were almost perpendicular other having been broken off the aniwith a drop of
 at least 200 feet our mal was in poor condition and evicamp was out on the prairie not far from
 dently old how it had come to run the edge of the bank during the night with the buffalo is
 a mystery no doubt a prairie fire came up driven by a having joined a herd as a calf probably
 heavy wind from the south and the in texas or some southern territory prairie was ablaze as far as the
 eye cculd see an immense herd of buffalo this is the only instance that ever were running for their lives
 along the came to my knowledge of a domestic parallel to the line of the fire it was animal running
 with the buffalo herd for although buffalo ranged toes during the summer they would where cattle grazed they never protect
 themselves by digging up the joined the bands but always ap ground with their horns then rolling eared afraid of
 the buffalo and on the loosened soil turning themselves would run from them on sight on their hump after a
 few rains these hollows partly filled with water and the buffalo a clumsy looking animal the buffalo after wallowing in
 them with short legs immense head and would emerge covered with wet clay shoulders would not lead you to believe
 which served as a protection against that he could attain any speed but the pestering flies the plains in the
 quite the contrary was the case it took clayey portion were covered with these the best among their hundreds of
 head deep buffalo wallows and some may of horses called by the indians buffalo still be seen runners to catch
 up to and keep even with the herd of running animals the many animals became blind from buffalo were as
 a general thing inof prairie fires and these had a much keenfensive and would run from a man on er
 sense of hearing or scent than those foot unless wounded or the cows had with sight the buffalo s sight
 ordinarily young calves and then they were afraid was poor and i think they depended of nothing an indian riding
 close to a greatly on scent these blind animals buffalo would often have his horse often acted as sentries for
 the herd and thrown and himself injured or killed by would give warning in a wonderful a sudden side thrust
 of the animal s manner on the approach of any susheavy and powerful head oftentimes picious object old bulls were
 frequenttossing the horse and rider in the air ly driven out of the herd and were savage animals the hair
 had in many in the plains indians such as the black stances fallen off and they went by the feet
 had an old custom of killing large name of scabby bulls hiding in the numbers in a grand slaughter by
 driving thick clumps of willows along the river or leading them into what were called bottoms they would rush out
 and at buffalo pounds these were enclo tack anyone coming into their vicinity sures generally at the foot of some
 high and woe betide you if your first shot cutbank with a drop of sometimes a did not bring them
 down hundred feet or more to the bed of the buffalo call was easily tamsome stream indian medicine men were
 ed we had several in old fort macable to lead herds of buffalo into these leod which we kept like
 cattle unenclosures they would clothe themselves in buffalo robes with horns attached til a year old after which they became
 vicious and had to be killed and on finding a herd would gradually a calf should its mother be killed
 lead them towards the point required would if you held your hands over i have myself seen an indian medicine
 man do this on more than one occasion its eyes and breathed into its nostrils follow a horse until you
 led it this custom must have been a very old into camp and allow itself to be one for after
 building old fort calgary handled just like a domestic calf in 1875 and exploring the country we found up the
 elbow river some ten the large grey prairie wolves roamed miles and under a cutbank going down in hundreds on
 the plains and followed to the river a layer of old buffalo bones the buffalo continually although they some three
 or four feet thick these fared well on the wounded the buffalo bones were covered by many feet of did
 not mind their presence in the least soil which had accumulated since the as they could always be seen running
 slaughter took place it must have been or walking in and out among the bands a very ancient kill as
 flint arrowheads the indians taking advantage of this were found in the layer would clothe themselves in a wolf skin
 immense numbers of buffalo were clawl up close to a fat cow and place an arrow or bullet in a
 vital spot if killed for the tongue alone the tongue the killing was done with an arrow being used as
 the only food at the medi many beasts could be killed before the cine lodge herd took alarm but it
 was somewhat in spite of the heavy coat the buffalo risky as a cow with a young calf would vuffered
 much from flies and rnosqui sometimes become suspicious and charge in which case a trampled and pablo s buffalo herd

 the year 1875 when f troop of the mounted police to which i belonged located the site of the first
 fort built at calgary a colony of beaver had a ‘ t ‘ ‘ river joining an island that lay
 at the dam built at the mouth of the elbow mouth of that river where it empties into the bow
 this colony was hard at work and had cut down most of the large cottonwood trees on the island on
 trap muskrats mink and other small furbearing animals the scent was strong and was the surest bait used in recent
 years the provincial government of alberta passed a wise law making a closed season for beaver this is in force
 throughout the province except in the northern portion and has done much to prevent the extinction of this animal the
 flesh of the beaver was unfit for food being rank and unpalatable but the tail was always considered a great
 luxury the elk the elk or wapati sometimes called the red deer was very numerous in the early seventies they
 ran in bands of many hundreds and were noble animals often weighing 1 000 lbs they frequented the foothills of
 the mountains and at the time of the building of the first fort macleod on the oldman river the porcupine
 hills lying north and west of that river was a favorite range of theirs thousands of cast off antlers could
 be seen lying scattered through the hills and large bands of elk would often be met they ranged from the
 foothills of the mountains as far as the cypress hills they were also numerous to the north they were easily
 killed for on being frightened they would bunch up in a panic and mill around instead of making off a
 hunter could when they got into this position kill them at his leisure the consequence being that they have almost
 become extinct in the wild state elk are now seldom found south the elbow along the bow river many colonies
 of beaver were at work and lingered for many years subsequently in 1883 i saw beaver at work on willow
 creek near fort macleod and in fact occasionally animals are still to be found on many rivers to the south
 in settled districts where they still exist they have given up their habit of dam building and are what is
 called bank beaver having their habitation in the river banks the amount of work done by a colony of beaver
 is almost unbelievable i have seen beaver meadows existing over a tract of swamp country many miles in extent the
 old line of the beaver dam of the saskatchewan although a few still range north of that river but they
 are very scarce in the year 1918 a very dry year in the south the elk in yellowstone park in
 montana were dying of starvation by the hundreds the american government made a present of over 700 head of these
 elk to canada and mr h sibbald went down and received them shipping them north a few died on the
 journey as they were in very poor condition but about 700 were turned out in banff national park and some
 also at the head of the brazeau river these elk have thrived and are now quite numerous sodded over and
 forming a solid bank extending for at least a mile and still after probably a century since its construction damming
 water from a small creek and forming a swamp of thousands of acres in area the beaver were easily trapped
 the bait being used generally the beaver castor rubbed on the trap it was sufficient to draw the animals into
 it the bait could always be procured from the hudson s bay company s different posts in the way of
 trade it was also used to the moose mocse were not often seen on the plains but were more numerous
 in the wooded country they have held their wooded country the crees to the north own well and are still
 to be found quite however killed all of this game they plentifully in the wooded section along came across the
 saskatchewan and to the north the antelope the c a r i bou the last and at the time of
 the advent the caribou were never numerous on of the mounted police the must numerthe plains although a few ranged
 in the ous of the deer family to be found on foothills of the mountains as far south the plains
 were the antelope large as the american boundary these were bands of these graceful creatures could a larger species than
 the barren land always be seen grazing near and even caribou which still range in immense among the herds of
 buffalo you could herds from the barren lands as far south often see several hundred in a herd the as
