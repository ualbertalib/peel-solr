 are divided into regular townships each township contains thirty six sections each of which is as near to being one
 mile square as the convergence of the meridians permits individual sections are divided into quarter sections of 160 acres each
 and into 16 legal subdivisions of 40 acres each road allowances are provided along the survey boundaries every mile east
 to west and every second mile from north to south so impressive and so all pervasive across the prairie landscape
 are the cultural patterns associated with this system of survey that many small survey anomalies within the system for the
 most part have been ignored a closer look at present day patterns reveals a number of widely scattered patches of
 land each of which has been defined by a distinct type of survey properly called settlement surveys an agricultural colony
 in 1841 the but known commonly as river lot sys settlement was laid out in long narrow tems they occupy
 in total only a very lots agreed upon by the settlers themsmall portion of the surveyed land of selves but
 a survey of the area was not the prairie provinces each area is provided until 1898 though the governunique in

 parkland of the saskatchewan valley could have been developed with less as population increased however effort had it been surveyed

 narrower lots in homes to stand close together along one part because of the desire of families to road he

 portions on would have reduced the cost of roads both sides of the river and bridges to the extent of
 75 percent 4 though the dominion lands act of 1872 provided for the survey of river the settlement survey system
 was lots in the north west where they were traditional practice in quebec and in thought to be advisable very
 few were a modified form was adopted in a num surveyed between that date and 1883 ber of areas in

 federal government to discontinue acre lots ten chains wide and a mile river lot surveys prince albert and a and
 a quarter deep similar dimensions few lots around batoche were the only had been used previously in both settlements surveyed
 in saskatchewan quebec and ontario and there can be in this manner many white settlers no doubt that the french
 and metis of especially in areas away from the rivers french descent were influential in the readily adopted the grid
 system which establishment of river lots throughout proved to be an easy means of identifythe prairies ing and securing title
 to land on the other hand the settlers who had estab when the land at red river was lished themselves
 on river lots of their first laid out in 1811 the various lots own design and the metis in particular
 were established facing the river with continued to appeal for river lot surveys their boundaries running inland as for without
 them they could not be nearly as practicable at right angles to certain of title to their land the river

 in southern alberta the presence of coal deposits along the high banks of the belly river was known quite early
 and by the 1880 s some coal had been mined for local markets the galts saw the possibility of large
 scale mining and on dec 11 1882 opened a mine at the coal banks the problem was to get the
 coal to market the canadian pacific railway then being constructed across the prairies would cross the south saskatchewan river at
 medicine hat so that the logical solution seemed to be to transport by barge to the railway where some of
 it would be used by the transcontinental locomotives and the remainder shipped to other markets by rail in england the

 story by john morrow on a cool october day in 1906 four irishmen sam and jim adams john coleman and
 i and an american from north freedom wisconsin jack dickie wended our way east from edmonton we travelled by the
 old base line trail for eighteen miles then as best we could for another fifteen miles through brush swamp and
 muskeg we had pooled our resources to buy a team of horses a wagon and supplies for the coming winter
 we reached the northeast shore of cooking lake by nightfall unhitched our weary horses built a campfire had a lunch
 pitched our tent and bedded down for the night the next day each of us went out scouting for a
 quarter section of land on which we would squat and establish a home this land was part of the cooking
 lake forest reserve and although it was all burnt over and not yet surveyed or open for homesteading its choice
 lay in the fact that it was good rich sandy loam it lay in a sloping valley between wannison lake
 and hastings lake with cooking lake on the west and islet lake on the east at one time this area
 h ad evidently temperatures sometimes as low as 60 been an indian hunting ground many below we ate the odd
 partridge but a time relics such as arrowheads flint the writer hereby acknowledges his inspearheads stone axes pemmican debtedness to
 the lowly bush rabbit pounders and tanning scrapers were rabbits were eaten every day stewed turned up fried or baked
 we also had lots of pork and beef as we could buy a dressed hog the main idea of squatting
 in this or a quarter of beef for five cents a pound district was the report that the railway from
 the occasional settler who would from winnipeg to edmonton might come pass through with a load on his way to
 through this location and we guessed edmonton it would be on the north side of cooking lake the cooking lake
 trail and the old beaver lake trail were travelled by the we decided to squat on a quarter sec early
 settlers from the tofield and beation each and by the end of november ver lake districts each of us had
 built a log shack of a kind in order to establish a claim on all the creeks and lakes had
 fish jack dickie s quarter a large two storey and creeks flowed all winter there house was built and the
 five of us batch were deer elk lynx fox mink and musked together for the winter we made rat and
 these meant ready cash for our headquarters there and built a log their fur and hides barn everything possible was
 home made our beds were made from poles the only settlers near this part of mattresses were gunny sacks stuffed

 is it to bury destitute indians who may happen to die in the vicinity of the town the agent who
 is supposed to have special charge of these people says it is not his the white settlers say most decidedly
 it is not theirs and the indians say they are not able all last winter the corpse of an indian
 woman lay above ground under the telegraph line on the south side of the river until the dogs carried it
 away because no one considered it his business to move in the matter although all knew of the case last
 week a similar case seemed likely to occur but thanks to the exertions of rev mr sanderson and the generosity
 of a few of the people the corpse was decently buried if there was a municipal organization here of course
 such things would be attended to by the municipality but in the present state of affairs it is manifestly unfair
 to throw the burden of the burial of these wards of the government on the individual settlers when the government
 has an agent here whose especial business it to attend to their needs edmonton bulletin dec 16 1882 18 old

 the useful advice to keep to the middle of the street and mind your own business this is a tough
 town we had to wait until evening for the office to open to book seats on the stage to helena
 next day when the agent entered his office and went behind his desk he took his six shooter from his
 hip pocket and placed it on the desk at his right hand such was law and order in montana then
 so different from that maintained by the north west mounted police across the boundary line american cowboys coming to work
 on alberta cattle ranches shed their six shooters at the boundary as trees shed their leaves in the fall and
 were glad to do so from butte we drove to helena where was the only bank in those parts from
 there we travelled by night and by day by the regular four h orse american stage coach through the rockies
 to fort benton on the missouri river which was the base of supplies for alberta territory passengers and freight coming
 up the river by steamer from st louis and elsewhere it was almost 175 miles from fort macleod at one
 of the stopping places a traveller joined us whom we heard called bishop and we found mr bishop as we
 supposed his name to be a pleasant companion a few days later when i attended the episcopal church at fort

 old schaps at the little bow round up camp on june 22 nd 1895 there is a harmless class of
 men who go to the country fairs drink lemonade and then make believe that they are drunk to make the
 girls believe that they are awful wild men that dress themselves up in the garb of cowb oys spurs the
 size of small cart wheels hat cut with a scissors and covered with mud to look old and tough thus
 attired and after having fortified themselves with a few glasses of mild lemonade they race about the grounds pull their
 poor nags up short knack down old women and make themselves the laughing stack of all who see them as
 to handling a rope some of them can swing it but the best the most of them can do is
 to let it dangle from the horn or sometimes trail on the ground as to raping a steer that is
 b yand them it is questionable if the most expert could put it over a barn and certainly the big
 drum or standard would be safe within their reach it is possible that one of them could put the rope
 over a gate post provided the horse stood still but it would be safe to bet th at the most
 expert of the breed could not do it while the horse was on the walk as a class they are
 harmless a little inclined to be boisterous when the lemon begins to work but the goad people of calgary should
 not encourage them strangers might take them for genuine and go away with a bad impression of the country in
 general and cow men in particular you will find a few of th is interesting breed in the pine creek
 country but none at high river the breed is too delicate to flourish so near wild cattle as a rule
 they do little but to ride round the country on a half starved cayuse too lazy to plough and too
 shiftless to own cattle they eke out an existence on the remittance plan their only redeeming quality is that they
 do not marry and are not therefore likely to perpetuate the breed in the name of genuine cow men i
 ask you a favour when one of th e breed makes himself so ridiculous that he is run in as
 dangerous do not pander to his vanity by describing his as a cow boy and do not bring discredit on
