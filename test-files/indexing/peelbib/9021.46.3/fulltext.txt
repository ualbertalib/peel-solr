 beef cattle industry in 1928 one senior spokesmen blamed it on the unpalatability of most of the beef offered for
 sale a situation brought about by a traditional reliance on the export market to provide the primary incentive for the
 improvement and finishing of our cattle 65 the sudden emergence of a ready market for stockers and feeders demonstrated the
 powerful role played by short term profit considerations the higher prices diverted thousands of stockers and feeders from their usual
 destinations in the finishing areas of ontario and quebec and the farms of western canada to the american corn belt
 alarmed at the domestic implications of so many young unfinished cattle leaving the country the federal department of agriculture intervened
 in 1916 through the car lot policy which enabled farmers purchasing stockers and feeders at western canadian stockyards to ship
 their animals back to their farms free of charge 66 other government measures to restrict stocker and feeder exports through
 stipulations respecting licences were resisted strenuously for example the farm and ranch review in arguing for an unrestricted free market
 appealed to patriotic fervour by insisting that a steer fattened in iowa would contribute more meat to the war effort
 than one marketed at a lighter weight in canada 67 yet by far the most significant impact of this brief
 period of prosperity was to perpetuate a belief expounded first in the 1 890 s by duncan maceachran that western
 canada was not suited to the finishing of cattle in that sense the large scale movement of stocker and feeder
 cattle to the corn belt was not only the logical and best but probably the only real solution open to
 western canadian cattlemen the calgary herald wrote in 1917 that canada was not equipped to prepare canadian beef for the
 market 8 two years later the province of alberta department of agriculture echoed the consensus by reporting that the importance

 calgary back and bill widdop herald cautioned ranchers in 1915 to send only their very best to chicago and referred
 to the calgary stockyards as being best for fat dairy stock and second grade steers m this relative indifference to
 the domestic consumer market was a longtime feature of the western canadian cattle industry and was rooted in a conviction
 that high export prices and quotas pre determined domestic consumer levels by reinforcing this wi belief the prosperity of the
 open american market between 1914 and 1920 delayed for ten years the ultimate realization that taste as well as price
 influenced domestic consumer preference referring to the crisis in the alberta history summer 1998 market for stockers and feeders should

 ‘ it 69 indeed the western stock growers association when trying to defeat the new tariff in 1922 was prepared
 to accept the levy on fat stock if the tariff on feeders was removed because of alberta s exceptional climate
 which often allowed widespread year round grazing and the delay of cash crop farming in making heavy inroads ‘ on
 ranching practices alberta s cattle ‘ ‘ ‘ industry was slow to develop a finishing tradition the issue was one

 the efficacy of corn over barley l 9 l 3 and during the war period some as a finishing feed

 by the continuing whether or not alberta could grow corn ecause 0 er a s emphasis by agricultural institutions on
 finally it could be argued that the exceptional climate which forage crop experimentation reluctance to introduce comprehensive cattle finishing programs
 in alberta was the reasons for this slowness to turn to often allowed widespread year linked to an endunng contrary
 mentality grain finishing of cattle were many and varied first there was the conviction in 1916 the editor of the

 sufficient a sentiment echoed sooner the farmers in western canada cattle industry was slow to in 1915 by no less

 number of unifinished animals being calgary herald commented in 1917 that it was cheaper to send cattle to the slaughtered
 and pointed out that at least feeding reas of the united states a 50 per cent of canadian dressed meat

 fourth annual meeting of dispose of all of their grain for instant the western canadian society of animal cash rather
 than risk the long range production best summed up an historic consequences by utilizing the surplus to feed and finish
 their cattle 75 it was reality when it recorded in 1930 that quoted in 1917 that 90 per cent of
 the the greatest problem in connection with livestock feed produced in canada went beef cattle production in western to the
 united states 76 the western stock canada arises out of the fact that there is alberta history summer 1998 no

 to the indians top logs between the sides of the cabin dr y over a little fire when the meat
 had and the few whites round to the best of then grass was thrown on the logs over dried on
 one side they turned the other our ability many of the indians died all this was placed a layer of
 mud which side the meat by being completely from disease and exposure to the first had to be thawed out
 this roof was dried was thus preserved for future use weather but smallpox was perhaps the not altogether water proof
 and in a heavy the best part of the dried meat was set most destructive aside for use in that
 form and the other rain storm the rain and mud came sometimes i accompanied my husband through the roof the

 they were light before the fireplace was hung a spit for sprinkled over the pounded meat a and they could
 be lifted out if they got hanging the meat spade was used to mix the meat and fat stuck in
 a mud hole when the water was until they were smooth bags made from high it made our travelling still
 more for lighting purposes we had our home buffalo hides and sewn with sinew were difficult and for fording the
 rivers we made candles prepared from the fat of used to hold the pemmican these bags made boats from buffalo

 family sewing to prevent leakage to be spared the regular annual trip to winnipeg and another time the hudson bay
 return was a long weary ride if we left employees at the bow fort hearing of in the middle of
 april and returned b y the approach of a warlike tribe fled the middle of september we were doing away
 and looking back shortly after it in good time for we had heavy loads they saw bow fort in flames
 while we had much excitement and the regular annual trip to adventure on our trips we were not one time
 when my husband was away lacking excitement and terror at home three blackfeet came to the house a winnipeg and
 return was a long when we travelled we were well armed few days later twenty to twenty five for we
 were always in danger from more came they tried to come in but the weary ride if we left in
 indian war parties the lndians would rev john mcdougall refused to let follow us at a distance and would attack
 them in unless they surrendered their the middle of april us if the opportunity arose however firearms we could not
 have withstood they were often afraid to attack if they them for long but luckily for us the and returned
 by the middle of thought we were well armed we played stoneys came and rescued us from safe and held
 the indians at a distance danger september we were doing it in until we had made certain that they were
 friendly and not hostile however all the indians were not hostile good time and brutal many like the stoneys were
 i was told of two families who were always the white man s friend who coming to settle in the
 country they helped us in our fight for existence were eating their meal in the foothills between pincher creek and
 high river it is easy to look back on those days and when they were surprised by a number to
 relate stories of our pioneering yet it of blackfeet the indians compelled the was the real life the excitement the
 whites to get them food and after they adventures even the terror and had eaten they killed them then they
 hardships made pioneering worth while burned their wagons and took all their and if i have any regrets it is
 only that possessions later with these indians those days were so soon over but the was seen a child with
