 lonely prairie dwellers could witness a rare sight on the land locked semi arid plains of southern alberta for a
 few weeks in 1883 and 1884 the north western coal and navigation company attempted to use the meager flow of
 the belly and south saskatchewan rivers to carry coal from their newly opened colliery cit coal banks now lethbridge to
 its market in medicine hat the venture lasted only a very brief time simply because the rivers were unsuitable for
 navigation if these rivers were evidently unusable why did the company invest so much in a venture doomed to failure
 were there no alternatives letters which the founder of the north western coal and navigation company sir alexander tilloch galt
 wrote to the prime minister of canada sir john a macdonald suggest that the river boat scheme was merely a
 temporary but essential expedient to k eep the coal banks colliery in operation l r ten otter is stu l

 nine trips todd in turn recruited competent ship while the alberta made only eight wrights from yankton and pittsburgh the
 season lasted less than seven weeks despite their collective skills the shipbuilders faced enormous obstacles all and only 3 000
 tons of coal were delivered to the canadian pacific railway the lumber for example had to be carried by labouriously
 slow bull trains the river transportation scheme had sixty miles from the company s timber proved to be a failure

 a great many colourful individuals who felt it their birthright and duty to constantly strive and develop the country to
 its utmost potential for the benefit and enjoyment of the people one such man was matthew mccauley the first mayor
 of the town of edmonton and prominent pioneer of the north west territories mccauley was born on june 11 th
 1850 near owen sound ontario his father alexander was of irish descent vhaving come to canada with his parents at
 the age of five from the town of antrim the family had settled on a homestead near kingston and remained
 at this site for many years matthew s mother whose maiden name was eleanor ‘ ‘ latimer was a canadian
 by birth being born and raised in the county of grey of scottish immigrant parents it was here she had
 met and married matt s father of young matt s early life as a boy one must say it was
 quite typical of most farm lads living in canada in the 1850 s era then he was off to owen
 sound public school where he received his elementary education after completing his schooling he had tried to follow in his
 father s and grandfather s footsteps as a farmer but all too soon found it a hopeless task matthew mccauley

 at the periodic visitations to the post age of 21 he left his eastern home to however in may of

 company had brought in a number of surveyors mccauley still found time to carry to divide the company s reserve
 land on his social life and courted a young and to set up definite boundaries they woman named matilda benson
 who was also surveyed lots in hopes of selling originally from sarnia ontario they these in the following year to

 where to be a blessing to the local town s mccauley continued to operate his livery people as not only
 would it ensure business it was here that their first the influx of new capital but also would two children
 were born greatly increase the local population by 1879 the pace of life in winnipeg what was not realized at
 the time howhad grown too calm for mccauley s ever was the fact that the hudson s liking and after
 many long nights of bay land was the only surveyed land deliberation with his wife he decided in the entire
 area many new settlers to sell their business and strike out once who eventually came to the town found again
 this time into the western frontier that they could not purchase a lot and their plans were to travel over
 the not wanting to return back east they prairies to the small village of edmon simply chose to squat on
 a convenient ton situated on the banks of the north location near the town centre and pro saskatchewan river ceeded
 to construct their new homes transportation for their journey came in many cases the sites were within in the form
 of an ox cart and for more that of another man s back yard for than twenty one days the

 for the most part their food during after 1882 the problem escalated to the trek was simple fare consisting of
 such an extent that violence began to flour bacon beans tea bread and erupt causing the citizens to become 12
 more and more aggravated over the in to the forming of the committee corncreasing number of new settlers moving pleted
 construction of a small one room into the district as law enforcement in shack just adjacent to the dwelling of
 the town was virtually non existent a a local old timer john sinclair the group of concerned citizens held a

 a protective association with the to be taken and then proceeded to the hopes of electing individuals who would newly
 built home and informed its owner successfully be able to combat the that they were about to drop his house
 claim jumpers and once again restore over the edge of the river bank to peace and order to the town
 for the this the man responded by producing post of leader the citizens called upon from beneath his coat a
 pair of six matt mccauley a job which he immedi guns and flatly stated that he had no ately accepted
 this became his first intention of leaving and would defend official position in the town of edmon his property to
 the end if need be ton the first course of action he took after a short scuffle mccauley was was
 the forwarding to regina of a num able to disarm the man and the comber of messages urging the government
 mittee began the task of lifting the house to send help and settle the dispute in off its foundations the
 owner protested a civilized manner however this line strongly and even threatened to remain of endeavour proved to no avail
 and locked within the house in order to preso his next step was much more direct vent it from being
 destroyed to this and meaningful not wanting to give mccauley simply remarked that if the claim jumpers time to organize
 a he wanted to commit suicide that was counter protection group mccauley his problem but the committee must summoned his
 men and took matters throw the shack over the bank as a into his own hands for according to lesson
 to the others needless to say him if the government can not or will the man chose not to remain
 within the not help us then we have no other structure choice but to help ourselves this began what mccauley
 called their first victim was a recent claim a viligance depository everytime jumper who had but a short time prior
 we wanted to move a house put up by this is a view of jasper avenue as it appeared during
 matthew mccauley s active years in edmonton 13 one of these men he said we would settle down and contribute

 down and took no strong opposition from the federal a seat as a school board member many government mccauley was
 able to years later in 1911 mccauley school execute the plan successfully and in was erected and named in his
 honour 1885 the school district of edmonton was in recognition of the work and effort officially formed he displayed when
 an active member at first a great many citizens were of the board outraged at the board s manoeuver but
 in 1885 another crisis appeared upon once they realized there was no escape edmonton s horizon when the riel rebelfrom
 paying the tax most forgot the lion broke out news of the frog lake entire matter this change however massacre
 spread throughout the northcaused another problem for a number west territories bringing fear and terror of non resident children were

 best to forward the land titles office from edmonton a telegram to the dominion government to strathcona this manoeuver would

 of the saskatchewan river and requested them to refrain from any and at the same time take away from violence

 advices from buffalo coulee about midway between battleford and hay lakes inform us that buffalo in vast herds are there
 and amusing themselves by turning operators in a way peculiar to themselves for some days past the line west had
 been broken and on an employee in search of the trouble reached buffalo coulee he found several large bands busily
 employed in the highly amusing pastime of rubbing down poles and dragging the wire over the prairie on their horns
 the repairer on reporting the matter to battleford asked have you let any new contracts lately on being told no
 he replied well it s strange when i arrived here this afternoon i saw an old bull rub down a
 pole put the wire on his horns and start southward towards fort macleod so i thought perhaps government had concluded
 to run a loop in there and had employed these buffalo to do the work to see if they could
 make a better job than the other government contractors this is the only part of the telegraph line ever troubled
 by buffalo excepting at rare intervals when they make a raid on the line between battleford and the crossing of
 the south saskatchewan the buffalo still remain around grizzly bear and buffalo coulee but the line is again in working

 in the spring of 1897 a railway was being surveyed through alberta and british columbia and i was packer to
 the chief engineer at this time there was no road through this part of alberta and from the crow s
 nest lake to fort steele a distance of 100 miles all the supplies had to be taken in on the
 backs of ponies for the engineers who were looking for the best road for the railway the ponies had specially
 made saddles and about 150 lbs was carried by each pony the packs being tied on with what is known
 as the diamond hitch it was rather a difficult knot to tie but the only one that was sure to
 keep the load on even if the ponies lie down and rolled with their packs on well my business was
 to take mr strapped as tightly as possible i have lumsden the chief to the various sur seen a whole
 string of ponies with such vey camps in the mountains our head sore backs that you could not believe quarters
 were on the edge of the crow s it possible that they could work and nest lake a lovely bit
 of water being when you see such a sight you may at the foot of the mountains and full of
 be sure of two things that the packer fine big trout which i used to catch does not know his
 business and he is for at least one meal a day my pack one that you would not like to
 be friends ponies used to graze about on the with fortunately most of the packers prairies and sometimes i would
 have are the kindest of men and take the nothing to do f or a week at a time but
 greatest of pride in their ponies they see that the ponies did not stray too would be ashamed to give
 them sore far and cook my meals for i was living backs f or that would mean that they by
 myself in a tent then one day the were careless packers and no man is chief would drive into camp
 and tell any good if his slackness means sufferme to be ready and next morn by six ing for dumb
 animals so the first thing o clock we would be on the way with to do when we made camp
 at night was the ponies packed with the tent and to take the packs off look at the ponies provisions
 and our two saddle horses backs and if there was any sign of a i wish i could tell you
 how glorious gall attend to it at once as good a some of the mornings used to be in the
 thing as anything was to bathe the place mountains on these trips we used to well with salt water and
 if the skin was stop for the day about four or five o clock broken there was nothing better than
 in the evening picking out a spot where sulphur the ponies were then hobbled the grass was good usually beside
 a and a bell tied round at least one of stream so we had plenty of water for them this
 was very necessary as the ourselves and the horses ponies were pretty cunning and would if you ever pack horses
 one of the hide in the bush and keep so quiet that first things to remember is to take the
 even with a bell on it was sometimes greatest care of their backs you know hard to find them after
 we had tended how painful it is to have a blister on the horses we made our camp put up
 your heel so you can imagine how the a tent built a big fire and got supper ponies must suffer
 with the least bit generally bacon and bread made in a of sore on their backs and a big load
 frying pan and tea how good every this manuscript is reproduced through the courtesy of t milvain of winchcombe england

 and your troubles are soon forgotten if off to make a bed to lay our blankets you are not prepared
 to take the rough on and off to sleep pretty early as we with the smooth the best plan is
 to stay had to be up by four o clock to get the at home lots of people are delightful
 ponies if we were lucky we found companions when everything goes well them in an hour brought them in and
 but there is nothing like a camping trip put their saddles on and then had break in a rough country
 for finding out what fast when that was over we made the sort of a man your friend is always
 packs up tightened the ponies saddles make the best of things don t grumble and put the packs on taking
 good care do your share of work round camp and that the packs balanced for a badly don t forget
 that the discomfort is just balanced pack was almost sure to give as bad for your friend as for you
 a sore back by six o clock we were coming back to the lake after one off and if it
 was fine weather such a of our trips i found an old friend jack life was hard to beat but
 it is not garnett waiting for me he had just always fine in the mountains it very heard of the
 great gold strike in the often rains and when one comes into klondyke the papers were full of the camp
 wet through one finds it a hard news and a lot of lies which we were matter to light a
 fire and perhaps wake to find out later but at that time it up in the morning to find the
 rain has appeared that all we had to do was to turned to snow one gets wet to the go
 to dawson city and pick up as much skin before the ponies are in and it is gold as we
 wanted my friend wanted not such fun but if you have a good me to start with him at once
 so thinkcompanion it isn t so bad when the sun ing it would be a fine trip and hoping athabasca
 landing was a jumping off place for the north here a number of boats are beached at the landing in
 preparation for the navigation season 19 ‘ ‘ i ‘ ‘ t d ‘ ‘ ‘ a s when travelling
 down the athabasca river men like the author had to navigate some treacherous rapids above is a boat of revillon
 freres passing through machine rapids to get some of the gold i said goodby at night we just drifted down
 taking to mr lumsden and ponies and started it in turn to keep watch off on our long journey two
 or three days brought us to the the first thing to do was to determine head of a series of
 rapids about 80 miles which way to go for there are three in length where we found a sad acways
 of getting into the klondyke we cident had just occurred five young consulted our friend major wood and fellows not
 realizing that they were he told us he had heard very bad ac close to the rapids sailed right into
 counts of the skagway trail so we went them two managed to get on to a rock off to edmonton
 and from what we heard but three of them had drowned this is there we decided to go in by
 the mac called the grand rapid and is very kenzie river route we built a big fine dangerous it is
 divided by an island boat brought sufficient provisions to last the left channel is quite impossible to a couple of
 years put the lot in two run and only at certain stages of the wagons and started off for athabasca
 river can the right channel be run in landing the wagon road to the landing safety the hudson s bay
 company had was good and we made the 100 miles in built a rough tramway down the island four days
 after a couple of days to put and we ran our boat and cargo over things right and land the
 boat we their lines then hired one of the comstarted out down the athabasca river pany s guides to take
 us down the long on the 2 nd september 1897 the string of rapids this guide was an weather was
 lovely the mosquitoes all indian and about the only english he gone the sun shining warm and bright knew was
 my name thomas bone best we were off on our 4 000 mile journey man swift water big paddle pull
 we carried along by a good four knot cur had to get two more men to row the rent we
 rowed when we felt like exer boat for plenty of power was needed cise and when the wind was favourable
 the channel is often very crooked and we set sail and took life easy we had to dodge in and
 out between the big a stove on board to cook our meals and rocks it is important to have a
 crew 20 that will do just as the steersman tells place that went over my head they them without looking
 round to see what fished me on board again and i soon is coming it is exciting working taking had
 dry clothes on and was none the a big boat down the steersman hanging worse on to an immense oar
 which is used instead of a rudder his feet braced and just below fort smith there is a bad a
 wild look in his eye now and again rapid we carried our boat and cargo shouting an order in tones

 in his book the arctic age these indians are awful fellows prairies and he doesn t exaggerate a to eat
 besides breakfast and supper bit we used to stop four times a day to give up till now our trip
 had been all them a big feed smooth sailing no hard work fine we were glad to get to fort
 mc weather plenty to eat and the country murray the first hudson s bay post after looking at its best
 we saw two or three leaving the landing here we said good moose along the river bank and a few
 bye to our guide and went off in peace lynx but no bear no doubt they were and quiet once
 more we met another back in the woods getting ready for a party like ourselves bound for the long winter
 yukon and used to tie our boats to the day after we arrived at fort gether at night this gave
 us more time resolution the weather turned very cold to sleep and we were glad to make arrangements in a
 few days we ran into lake with the steamer wrigley to take us chipewyan and saw a sight which was
 out as far as burnt island about 18 worth coming a long way to see the miles we still had
 to go 100 miles place was alive with geese ducks and across the lake to the mouth of the swans
 lake chipewyan is a favorite mackenzie and were glad to find a fair nesting place for wild fowl and besides
 wind in the morning we hoped to make that thousands and thousands stop there hay river that night but had
 a miserto rest on their way south able day of it it was cold the wind at fort chipewyan we
 were invited turned into a gale and a nasty sea got to dine with the hudson s bay factor up
 darkness overtook us and as the who was disgusted with us because we weather was getting steadily worse we could
 not eat a whole goose he told us turned our boat for the shore as good we would never be
 men of the north luck would have it we struck a sandy until we could do so the hudson s
 beach and had to carry all our stuff bay company like their men to live through the surf for about
 200 yards on the products of the country the it was a very cold job but a fire and factor
 has bread once or twice a day a good meal soon put us right and we but the indian and
 half breed servants were not long rolling into our blankets eat up their allowance of flour as soon next morning
 it was 10 below zero as they get it so for the rest of the year and a lot of
 ice was forming we had live on fish meat and tea beached our boat within a mile of the next
 morning we were off again and hay river and the indians did not think soon into little rock river that
 night we could get our boat any further before we had a lot of trouble with the sand the freeze
 up for several days it looked bar we used to keep our long rubber very like it however on the
 fourth day boots on so we could jump overboard the weather moderated a strong wind when the boats grounded and
 shove broke up the ice and away we went them off one night i got a fine duck again and
 ran into the mackenzie withing for i jumped overboard into a deep out any trouble that evening 21 we were
 anxious to get to fort how cold it was often it would be 30 simpson at the mouth of the
 liard river or 40 degrees below at that time our idea was to buy dogs up to the evening of
 the third day at that post and spend the winter haul i did not see a soul so i was
 glad to ing provisions up the river and over the reach an indian s camp that i rememdivide to the
 head waters of the pelly bered passing on the way down the then drift down the yukon the following river
 the indian gave me a whitefish spring for supper and i thought i could walk we found a lot of
 ice forming in the into providence in three or four hours mackenzie and had to give up drifting the night
 was beautiful about 40 at night it wasn t much fun for any degrees below and the northern lights one
 now it was cold work sitting in a were out as bright as day i made good boat for twelve
 hours at a stretch some time for the trail was well beaten the of the sunsets were glorious the light
 river at this point is very wide and full effects on the river running full of ice of islands was
 wonderful we were not in much about six miles from providence the of a mood to admire anything by the
 ice gave way and let me in up to the time the sun set and it was almost a knees
 the only thing to do in a case relief to wake up of this sort is to build a fire
 and dry one morning towards the end of out so i made my way to the timber october we found
 the boat frozen in intending to do so you can imagine so hard the running ice so heavy that what
 a fright i got when i found i had we decided it was better to stop and been foolish enough
 to leave my matches build a camp there were plenty of at the indian s camp the only thing good
 logs and in two or three weeks was to get to providence as quickly as we built a good log
 cabin with big possible my moccasins were all ice open fireplace and a good cache for and kept slipping off
 the hard ice trail our grub before we had finished this into the deep snow so it was hard work
 work the river was frozen still the i got to the post about midnight country in its winter dress the
 river and announced my arrival by falling closes up with a good deal of fuss there down with a loud
 crash my ice macis an ever increasing grinding going casins striking the board floor the on for a long time
 as the ice jams first factor and his wife rushed out and in in one place and then in another
 this no time had my frozen things off and my makes the river very rough travelling feet in a tub
 of snow with an indian at the ice hummocks are as high as your each foot my toes were frozen
 stiff and head i was slightly frozen up to the knees by the beginning of december the the first two
 hours were comfortable camp was finished and plenty of good enough mrs scott got me a nice meal firewood cut
 we decided that i should and i was so sleepy with the warmth walk to providence about 75 miles dis
 and food that i never bothered about my tance and try to buy a dog team and feet but when
 the circulation began then go down to simpson and see what to come back it was about as painful reports
 we could get about the liard a business as i have ever experienced i started off with a caribou robe
 in cases of frost bite it is impossible to some flour bacon tea frying pan and a thaw out the
 affected part too slowly small kettle the whole pack weighing after that one must bathe as much as about 30
 lbs the travelling was bad possible in hot water and i found i could not make more than my feet
 were pretty bad and i dare 16 miles a day i used to pick a camp say if a doctor
 had been around he ing place where there was a big clump would have cut off my toes but there
 of trees and plenty of dry wood make wasn t one nearer than edmonton a a lean to shelter of
 pine boughs and thousand miles away the hudson s build a big fire in front i would sleep bay people

 dog sleighs laden with he had come north in the early fifties furs their wives and their families aras missionary
 to the indians and spent riving on foot the first thing was to his life working for their good he
 had have a big feed it was a custom with left the mackenzie by this time and had the factor
 to give them flour sugar gone to the yukon it was good to hear tea and tobacco then for about
 two how everybody in the country lived him days a great feed goes on they eat there were numberless tales
 of his un as much as they can then smoke and selfish sacrifice his wife had been with sleep for
 two or three hours then go at him 30 years they were quite rich it again till everything is finished
 the people and the bishop was a great business begins by the chief of the tribe scholar everything had been
 given up making a long speech telling how his for the indians the bishop died eight people always trade with
 the same cornyears later at caribou crossing he pany never taking their furs to the other 23 traders and what
 fine fellows they are improve with the warm weather and it then the company s factor makes a was with
 great anxiety that we longed speech in the similar strain after this for the river to break up so we
 might furs are opened and the trading goes get him down to simpson the river on the indians taking flour
 tea sugar broke on the 13 th of may and a few powder shot rifles tobacco blankets days later we
 carried garnett on board bright coloured hankerchiefs calico etc our boat we started off in spite of in exchange f
 or their furs the fact that the river was full of ice when they have traded their furs and it
 took us nearly two weeks to get and got what they want they go off to to simpson we found
 the river jammed the woods for another trip they live a few miles below camp and had to wait on
 what they kill and if as it some four days before it went out if we had times happens they
 have bad luck and not been so anxious about garnett we rabbits are scarce they starve to death should have
 enjoyed watching the jam i saw a family of a man his wife and all night and day an enormous
 body three children looking for all the world of ice was grinding into the jam forclike living skeletons the man
 over ate ing enormous blocks of ice and huge and died the same day after his arrival boulders up the
 bank twenty feet above the woman and children recovered and high water mark all this time the river in a
 few weeks were as well as ever was rising finally when the pressure when they get too old to go
 out hunting was too great the whole mass moved they live around the post and the corn off with a
 roar that could be heard for pany takes care of them miles we were delayed several times fort providence is
 a fish eating post by similar jams and were thankful to it is 40 miles from great slave lake and
 see simpson at last garnett by this every fall the company send their men time was quite unable to move
 and was up and catch 3 000 to 4 000 whitefish very weak we soon had him in a cornfor
 winter use every man working for fortable bed and on a diet of milk and the company is allowed three
 whitefish raw potatoes he made a wonderful a day it is the finest eating fish i ever recovery tasted he
 joined another party two months later coming up the grand river onto all the time i was at the post
 we the headwaters of the stewart and arate the fish three times a day except rived in dawson in 1899
 after two years on sundays when we had moose or on the way he caught typhoid fever duck for dinner
 we had a small bit of after arriving in dawson and died in a bannock for breakfast and supper and
 few days a better man to make a trip potatoes but no bread at dinner we with would be hard
 to find he was also had curries of some sort at supper never out of temper understood all at the
 end of the three months i about camping and was always anxious had not begun to be tired of fish
 to do more than his share of work he towards the end of april my feet took the rough with
 the smooth without were well enough for me to begin travel a grumble another man and i started off for
 our after leaving simpson we made winter camp which we reached in a few fairly good time down the river
 the days without any adventure at this mackenzie is a fine stream wide and time of year the sun was
 getting high deep with no sand bars and rapids we and the days were getting warm there were close to
 the ice and had a very was a good deal of water on the river unpleasant night at the head
 of the but after the sun got low the water ramparts a few miles from good hope froze hard enough
 to bear and the travel the ramparts is a narrow gorge one ling was good to three miles long we
 found the ice i found poor garnett in a bad way was jammed but just managed to get he had
 been taken down with scurvy our boat behind a big cake of ice and a few weeks before and could
 only get lay there till the jam broke which it about with difficulty i hoped he would did in the
 early morning as soon as 24 the river began to fall big blocks of island the furs they brought in
 were ice that were piled up on the bank nearly all white fox and a few polar began to tumble
 back near us we dared bear they were much bigger fellows not go into the ramparts till the river than
 i expected to see began to clear and managed to land mr firth the factor at mcpherson our boat on
 a small island there we is a fine sample of the company s serlay for 36 hours and went on
 into good vant at the time i met him he had hope determined not to move till the been on
 the mackenzie river aver forty river was clear of ice years without going out he was an from fort good
 hope the river grad orkney islander and had come out to ually widens and when we left it to the
 far north when he was sixteen years turn up the peel river it must have old at one time the
 company was been five miles wide here we were very jealous of any outsider coming into well within the arctic
 circle and only their country and did all they could to 300 miles from the arctic ocean fort keep them
 out they wouldn t allow mcpherson was the company s newest their men to go outside most of them northern
 post eighteen miles up the peel were recruited from the western high river we stayed there a week and lands
 when very young and nearly all were lucky enough in seeing the indians married indian wives and settled down arrive
 after their winter up the peel contented enough strange tales were about 100 of them came down in seven told
 of the fate of anyone trying to get large boats made of caribou skins out of the country in those
 days it was loaded with dry caribou and furs the pretty well impossible for a man to get tribe was
 the finest lot of indians we away if the company did not wish it had seen bigger men and more
 intelli there are two ways of getting to gent they are meat eating indians and the yukon from mcpherson one
 is to the difference between them and the go up a small river called the rat across slave indians who
 live entirely on fish a short divide to the headwaters of the is very marked bell river and on to
 the porcupine and the eskimo trade at this post and yukon the other way is to cross the we saw
 several boats of them arrive hudson s bay winter portage a distance they mostly came in whale boats that of
 80 miles to la pierre house on the they had got from the whalers at hershel bell river years ago
 before there were after he arrived in the yukon the author moved to various mining towns he is seen above
 at right at a cabin at bonanza in the yukon in 1899 25 any steamers on the mackenzie or yukon
 ing mcpherson la pierre house had rivers all the hudson s bay supplies been abandoned years before and there went
 to the trading posts on these rivers were no indians there we built a raft by this way they were
 taken to la and started off down the bell at the pierre house in winter on dog sleighs junction with
 the porcupine five of our and went on in scows when the river party left us to go up the
 porcupine broke up the following spring all the prospecting it being their intention to furs came out by this route
 we decided cross the divide and come down sheep to go on the winter portage and hire creek to the
 yukon in the early part of two indians each to carry our bedding the winter i lent them my dogs
 and sufficient grub to take us to fort i may as well tell you what became yukon of this party
 they made their way at this point the sun was shining for slowly up the river prospecting f or gold
 24 hours and we were to travel at night on the way the small supply of flour and sleep in
 the day bacon and tea that they started with one evening about five o clock we was finished by the
 middle of august started off seven of us and four indians and from then on they lived on what each
 indian carries 100 lbs besides suf they killed caribou moose goose and ficient dried caribou to last them the fish
 unfortunately they had no salt and trip in all about 125 lbs they carried no doubt this is what caused
 them all the load well up on their shoulders held to get scurvy in september there were on by a
 strap across the forehead each thousands of caribou round them but indian had two dogs carrying from 20 to they
 delayed killing very many as the 30 lbs each the cavalcade was com weather was warm and they intended pleted
 by my four dogs for which i had to wait till it was cold enough to be traded my boat
 and what provisions sure of keeping one morning when they were left over awoke the caribou had disappeared our troubles
 began the first camp they were on their way to their southern out of mcpherson one of my indians feeding
 ground and not only had the wanted bacon and on being refused small bands gone but the big herd had
 turned sulky next evening when we gone as well got out we found the indian had dis the men s
 progress up the river now appeared so there was nothing for it became very slow by the time they but
 for me to carry his pack were at the foot of the divide they were we made about 15 miles
 a day and all weak three of them beginning to the trail was not bad as it crossed the be
 very down hearted it was now the rocky mountains which are practically end of october and they had killed rolling
 hills at this point the mosqui nothing but a few beaver and had only toes were bad and for a
 greenhorn a few hundred pounds of caribou meat packing is hard work we used to rest left it was obvious
 to two of the party five minutes every mile we had several that the best thing was to push on
 over streams to cross some of them very the divide and try to get back to the high and swift
 one could not help mcpherson the other three men were but admire the indians for at some of afraid to
 try the summit and finally the crossings they put the dog packs decided to let ritchie and macphee try on
 top of their own making close on to make the trip and bring back help 200 lbs and walked across
 these raging they left all the meat and the four dogs torrents without any trouble i had to and started
 on the trip with four beaver have my pack carried across and even skins and a caribou skin they cut
 the then i had to get an indian to help me hair off these skins and boiled them for my
 toes bothered me a good deal drinking the liquor and chewing the we got to la pierre house on the
 skin on the tenth day they staggered sixth day and uncommon glad we into lee pate s cabin at the
 mouth of were to see it the indians went off sheep creek and for two days pate on the home
 trip after a rest feeding cared for them feeding them at short their dogs for the first time since leav
 intervals macphee was very ill and 28 did not recover for months but ritchie steamer that had been intended for
 was well enough after nine days to circle on to dawson the miners were guide pate back with a dog
 team when down waiting for the boat and the capthey arrived at the camp they found tam explained about his
 orders to go on a note saying they had finished the the miners at once had a meeting and meat
 eaten the dogs and had deter five of them came down armed with mined to travel down river in the
 hopes rifles and told the captain gently but of meeting some indians the following firmly that they intended to take
 their summer a party of mounted police found winter supplies off the boat anyhow their bones only a few miles
 from the they explained that it was their intencamp no doubt they had frozen to death tion to take it
 to the company s store in the meantime irving and i had and pay for it as they took it
 out the kept on our way downstream and got captain being a sensible man said to fort yukon in thirteen
 days we had there was nothing to be done so let them expected to make the trip in half the
 have their way an officer in the u s time but the water was low and we had army was
 on board and undertook to a great deal of trouble getting the raft put matters right but unfortunately he through
 some of the shallows we had did not understand the temper of the nothing left but flour and not much
 of men nor did he realize that they had that for the last four or five days we been in
 the country a number of years used to plan what a great feast we without any law but what they
 dealt would have when we got to fort yukon out themselves the miners treated him but alas when we arrived
 we found quite respectfully until he was foolish there was nothing left but some very enough to threaten them when
 they told ancient bacon sugar flour and tea so him that unless he held his tongue and we did the
 best we could with that minded his own business they would we heard terrible tales of the short throw him
 into the river when they age of food in dawsori and how hun had taken what they wanted they said
 dreds of people had been sent on to good bye to the captain and the bella circle city and fort
 yukon we found went on up to dawson mr turner was these stories to be exaggerated but not in charge
 of circle at this time and told without some truth me the facts of the case there had been a
 doubt that there we had plenty to amuse us during was sufficient food to keep the camp the six days
 we had to wait for a till spring and captain constantine had steamer there were lots of ducks and advised
 all those without funds or food geese to watch and a constant procesto go down the river where they could
 sian of boats loaded with disgusted cut cord wood for the river steamers people on their way out via st
 michaels everything was very expensive this a lot of them had got so homesick before winter and nothing could be
 had for they got to dawson that they had not less than a dollar a pound beef was stopped at
 all nearly all of them two dollars and up candles a dollar abused the country and our government each and
 sometimes nails the same and said there was no gold and advised one of the large transportation corn us not
 to go ponies had a curious experience with one morning the sovereign came one of their steamers at circle city
 steaming up the river and in a few they decided in view of the fact that minutes we were aboard
 and off on the dawson was short of food to send a last stage of our journey gunslingers a very
 favorite and dangerous practice among the small boys of calgary is the carrying and use of dangerous firearms their favorite
 weapon is a small revolver which they pack in their pockets and even on occasion take to school catapaults are
