 prospecting on the stony plain the one on horseback and the other outfitted with an ox hitched in a broken
 buggy both chose the same quarter section the ox man having examined the land and started for town a little
 ahead of the horse man he was soon overtaken and left out of sight by the latter who had no
 fear that the ox would overtake him getting near town and it being about noon he called at a friend
 s house a little off the road to have dinner the dinner was good the friends friendly valuable ideas were
 exchanged as to the new property and time slipped away at last the visit ended and the land seeker started
 out he looked back up the road but could see no sign of the ox and thinking how lucky it
 was that he had a good horse under him that day he started for the land office to secure his
 farm but as he came in sight of the building he saw a man an ox and a broken buggy

 remained vacant witnessed a dramatic increase of interest until 1896 when a group of indians who in indian lands of
 western canada as the had emigrated to montana following the demand for farm land increased after 1900 riel rebellion were
 deported from the unofficials of the department of indian affairs ited states these indians had originally undertook an active campaign
 to encour been members of various bands in western age indians to surrender substantial por canada but the department of
 indian aftions of their reserves to accommodate fairs allowed them to settle as a group on growing numbers of settlers

 band at seven miles north east of ponoka on the the time of their settlement on the bobtail calgary edmonton
 trail is an interesting reserve they were not classed as a separate study of how the government responded band and
 were not given ownership of the to pressures brought to bear upon it by reserve for they had no claim
 to it under various interests to take land from indians treaty 2 and sell it to those who most western

 confusion and controversy pressed interest in indian lands and attempt it began when chief bobtail signed an ad ed to
 convince government officials to obtain hesion to treaty six in 1877 but it was surrenders on their behalf 3 pressure
 from not until 1885 that bobtail gave his con settlers was most intense in alberta consent to have land surveyed

 who were living employed with the treaty and abor n the nearby samson and ermineskin iginal rights research program of
 the reserves indian association of alberta smacking too much of the policies followed by the americans and thus unacceptable 5
 during the initial years after the signing of the treaties the government generally resisted pressures for land surrenders the department
 apparently believed that the western indians were not advanced enough in civilization to be able to take advantage of those
 provisions of the indian act which were designed to decrease the importance of the reserve and thereby to eventually lead
 to the assimilation of indians to european values 4 however by 1900 the era of directed civilization was coming to
 a close the reserve had come to be regarded by the department as an institution which prevented assimilation so amendments
 to the indian act were passed by the laurier government to encourage land surrenders the new amendments allowed an increase
 in cash distribution from a surrender the former ceiling of ten per cent now became 50 per cent of the
 probable purchase price of the land to be used as an inducement for a surrender for sale 7 in 1907
 the reasoning behind the department s change in policy was expressed in the following terms the large influx of settlement
 of recent years into the younger provinces has dictated a certain modification of the department s policy with relation to
 the sale of indian lands so long as no particular harm nor inconvenience accrued from the indians holding vacant lands
 out of proportion to their requirements and no profitable disposition thereof was possible the department firmly opposed any attempt to
 induce them to divest themselves of any part of their reserves conditions however have changed and it is now recognized
 that where indians are holding tracts of farming or timber lands beyond their possible requirements and by so doing seriously
 impeding the growth of settlement and there is such a demand as to ensure profitable salethe product of which can
 be invested for the benefit of the indians and relieve pro tanto the country of the burden of their maintenanceit
 is in the best interest of all concerned to encourage such sales 8 in order then to relieve the country
 of the burden of maintaining the indians the department of indian affairs shifted its policy to recognize the desirability of
 selling land for their support bob tail a cree chief settled at hobbema after signing an adhesion to treaty no
 six following the riel rebellion of 1885 he and most of his followers abandoned the reserve in 1901 the department
 of the interior anxious to provide more lands for incoming settlers sent out william d pitcairn the dominion lands agent
 to examine the feasibility of attaining some indian reserve lands for the purpose of settlement pitcairn reported back to the
 department that land for homesteads was being eagerly sought but the people have been shut out from settling north east
 of ponoka because the land belonged to the indians of the hobbema indian agency 9 this agency had originally contained
 separate but adjacent reserves for four separate bands including samson s ermineskin s bobtail s and sharphead s the latter
 band had subsequently surrendered its entire reserve on sept 11 1897 giving up an area of 42 4 square miles
 situated on the battle river during the three years since the surrender almost all of the land from the sharphead
 reserve had been sold pitcairn suggested that the bobtail reserve would be a prime candidate for a second surrender in
 the area it contained approximately 20 000 acres of excellent land but perhaps more importantly he believed that the indians
 who were living on the reserve sawmill would be useless 14 at the same possessed no title whatever to bob
 time there was not sufficient hay on samtail 11 pitcairn urged the department to son s reserve to supply the
 additional 50 take advantage of the uncertain title of indians from the bobtail reserve laird these indians in the interests
 of settlement therefore concluded that looking at the now on behalf of the settlers and resi proposition from all points
 i would recomdents of this district your subscriber mend that no action be taken at present earnestly prays that the
 government as suggested by mr pitcairn 5 take into their early consideration the advisability of opening up this reserve however
 others in the department of for settlement on the same terms and indian affairs were not so ready to shelve
 basis as the sharphead reserve there the idea of obtaining land surrenders in is so far as i am awarenothing
 stand the hobbema agency in september 1904 ing in the way of the government doing this and if it were
 desired i could guar inspector j a markle learned while visitantee to forward to the department one ing hobbema that
 the department was of the largest signed petitions that has favourable to the idea of surrenders there ever been made
 here because so long markle concluded that each of the bands as we are shut off to the north and
 northeast the settlement of the district could spare a few sections of their reserve progressive as it has been will
 be re without doing themselves any injury 6 tarded the indian agent w s grant had pre such was the
 notion of progressive viously been unable to convince the indians settlement as viewed by one who was in to even
 consider the question but markle s tent on swiftly populating the west pit aggressive salesmanship evidently convinccairn s letter was
 forwarded to david laird ed chief samson that a surrender might the indian commissioner who took issue be possible chief
 samson and members with some of the land agent s statements of his band gave their tentative approval laird claimed
 that the title of the indians to a surrender of about eight square miles to the reserve was valid especially
 as most on the north east corner of their reserve of the original members of the bobtail band conditional on
 their receiving a high price were still under treaty laird further argu for the land as markle reported ed that
 the recent surrender in december one speaker stated that this was very 1901 of a small portion of the western
 valuable land and as the whites were boundary of the reserve for the right of way wealthy they would expect
 to get twenty dollars per acre for the land 7 of the calgary and edmonton railway at chief samson had
 himself insisted that the holbrook implied that the department still land be sold at not less than 15 per acre
 recognized that indians had title to that land it was unclear however whether this markle recognized the impossibility of the
 title belonged solely to the original bobtail department accepting a surrender on these indians who had remained in 1886 or
 terms but predicted that whether it extended to the newly settled if the surrender is made i am sure they
 will be glad to accept the market value montana band this question would con for it the land it will
 in my opinion tinue to vex the department for years to command very near ten dollars per come laird insisted
 that since the mon acre tana band had been requested to approve markle must have been annoyed to learn the
 recent surrender the department that at the band meeting held on july 8 of therefore acknowledged these indians as the
 following year the band decided almost the owners of the reserve 3 unanimously not to surrender the eight laird was
 also against a surrender of square miles as w s grant the agent the reserve on the grounds that the
 bobtail present at the meeting reported reserve was an indispensable source of chief samson made a strong speech in favor
 of surrender as the money would building timber firewood and hay for the purchase so many things which they neighbouring
 bands there was no timber quired to push ahead faster than they on samson s reserve and as wood from
 had been doing in the past he knew ihe bobtail reserve was used in the agency that the majority were
 against the surrender but still he would like to see awmill the loss of that reserve would them doing more
 for themselves and eave the indians without wood and the they could do but little if they had no in
 the face of this sentiment chief samson would not vote for the surrender of the lands and therefore the resolution
 was resoundingly defeated by the band however grant added that a good deal of the opposition to the surrender centred
 around the timing and price involved and did not reflect a firm opposition to land surrenders in principle in fact
 he informed the department that some of the indians had indicated that the question of surrendering the lands should be
 left in abeyance for only a year or two 22 this element of the samson band was reflecting a developing
 sense of business acumen and it was apparent that they were prepared to hold out for the highest price which
 they felt they could obtain in january 1906 inspector markle made another visit to the hobbema agency and his subsequent
 report to the indian commissioner centred upon the desirability of amalgamating the samson and bobtail reserves basing his calculations upon
 the ratio of 128 acres per person as provided for in treaty no six markle argued that the bobtail reserve
 was 11 808 acres in excess of the needs of the 63 indians of montana band residing on it in
 contrast samson s band whose numbers had grown to 373 members was 8 384 acres short of joe samson one
 of the leading chiefs at hobbema was persuaded to favor surrendering part of his reserve in the belief that the
 money could be used to improve his people s farming capabilities money to purchase horses and mackinery 9 but the
 opponents of the surrender would not be swayed grant paraphrased the remarks made by the indians as to why they
 had changed their minds and now opposed the area which the treaty of 1876 had stipulated for such a number
 markie s solution was to amalgamate the two bands and join the two reserves thereby taking a surrender of the
 extra 3 126 acres or approximately five sections that were in excess of their treaty entitlement markle also noted that
 the neighbouring ermineskin s reserve possessed an excess of 6 720 acres or ten and a half square miles under
 this method of calculation 2 the assistant indian commissioner j a mckenna reacted to markle s analysis and proposals by
 pointing out that it would not be the part of wisdom to admit the the surrender the reserve is already
 too small being now only the size of a good washbasin the white neighbours are now too close to us
 and further concentration and confinement will only lead to trouble the land is constantly increasing in value and it will
 be a valuable asset for the rising generation of indians and it is for our children that we live grant
 reported that the indians wished that the price for their land be set prior to any surrender the indians he
 said believed that there is no rush to surrender our lands the whites have plenty of lands and do not
 need it and when the time comes when they do need it we can get more for it then than
 is possible at the present time when all the children are grown up and are self supporting then we might
 surrender the land but not sooner principle that area should be in accordance with population now unless the rule could
 be made to work both ways 24 of course those indian bands whose populations had increased since 1876 had virtually
 no chance of regaining additional lands for their reserves as the surrounding territories had largely been taken by non indian
 settlers markle s proposal also failed to take into account the increase in indian popula whereby the indians aboriginal title
 to the lion which was gradually being noticed land could only be extinguished with their by officials in the department
 early in the consent 28 markle believed that few protwentieth century gressive indians would object to the cutting however markle
 continued to persist in off of portions of reserves not in use by his efforts to obtain land surrenders in
 this members of their band 29 he suggested agency a letter to the department follow that discontent among the indians
 over ing an inspection tour reported that such a policy could be deflected by allocatalthough chief samson and a number
 ing about 15 of the proceeds from the of his band are yet anxious to carry out sale of these
 lands on improvements within the proposal that was made in septem the remaining portion of the reserve and ber 1904
 a majority of the band led by for working outfits for their use 3 in this a number of un
 progressive indians were not inclined to ratify the surrend way the surrender could be used to raise er of the
 land in question 6 the standard of living of the band markie markle repeated his proposals for an am proposed
 that the remaining 85 per cent algamation of bands and suggested that of the proceeds from the sale should be
 about 1 700 acres of bobtail s reserve in placed in trust and that only the annual township 43 lying
 west of the battle river interest be used for the bands farming and be surrendered he added that economic needs
 including aid to the aged when indian bands are holding more and helpless 3 this last measure was deland than
 they are entitled to under the signed to win the favour of the older more treaty and not using it
 it seems to me intransigent indians that the governor general in council should be empowered to cut off from markle
 also stressed that it would only such reserves such surplus portions be a matter of time until the calgary and
 without having to secure the consent of a majority of the indians of the band edmonton railway company would reas

 to the proclamation of 1763 mark may have been designed to appeal to he centre for the administration of indian
 affairs for the bobtail samson and ermineun reserves was at hobbema above are the indian agency buildings at the turn
 of the century frank oliver the new minister of the in in view of oliver s self proclaimed image tenor

 the deal was not in thus it would seem natural for oliver to the best interests of either the indians
 or be in favour of markle s plan for surrender the government ing the west side of the bobtail reserve
 the very purpose of securing the surrender was to get settlement along the following markle s visit in january 1906

 indians to obtain land surrenders was given oliver s low estimate of the potencalled upon to arrange a meeting with
 the tial of indians and his unwillingness to various bands on may 8 and to explain the spend money on
 their betterment it is not material benefits they would thereby gain surprising that when the indians made as mcdougall reported

 bordering on the railway oliver made some violent speeches against the sur refused their offer moreover to have acrender of
 any parts of their reserves and cepted the bands demands for no further then left the council 3 samson s

 was interested after a long and wearisome debate it was no further proposals for the surrender decided to adjourn and

 22 samson s band agreed to he had begun in 1906 for a surrender of surrender approximately 11 000 acres
 on a portion of the bobtail reserve west of five conditions firstly the indians insisted the battle river through which
 the railroad ran he was of the opinion that such a surthat the minimum sale price be 10 per render
 would probably require only the acre and that mcdougall be employed to look after their interests in the sale second
 consent of one or more families of the ly in the event of a surrender the indians old bobtail band

 station created in townas the freedom to move about the country ship 44 a factor which was not likely to
 be missed by oliver without requiring a permit from the indian several administrators within the buragent fourthly the indians requested
 permission to deal directly through the indian eaucracy initially challenged markle s opinions s bray the chief surveyor argued agent

 bear and his refugee the other bands would in due time fall indians had been allowed to return to caninto
 line 38 this no doubt disturbed him ada with full treaty rights on the condition as he sincerely believed that
 the surrender that they return to the reserve to which was in their best interests they formerly belonged chief accountant
 duncan campbell agreed to admit the bobtail indians as scott noted that the bobtail band had waiv members of the
 samson and ermineskin d all their rights to the reserve by sign bands he deemed that it would be fair
 to ng a document to that effect upon re distribute the proceeds from sale of that tntering treaty status in
 1887 however reserve to both of these bands as a whole scott did not believe that this document as the
 montana band had no treaty rights had any binding effect as they had gradu did not belong to a specific

 in full enjoyment of treaty on the bobtail reserve they would not rights 44 receive any of the proceeds from
 sale of in the meantime the rev mr mcdou that reserve gall had returned to the hobbema agency however the
 assumption that the boband had gained the assent of the samson tail reserve could be disposed of without band to
 the surrender of most of those lands a formal surrender was dispelled by d c on their reserve which were
 situated west of scott who had discovered in the course the railway mcdougall wrote oliver re of his search of
 the treaty paylists that there questing that the surrender be carried were members of the original bobtail band through as
 soon as possible as this will living on the samson and ermineskin rehave a good effect on these indians but
 serves who had never withdrawn from even more so on the adjacent bands as treaty scott concluded that to the
 bobtail reserve mcdougall had this makes it clear that the proprietary spoken to the montana band about the right in
 the reserve is still vested in the members of the old band and that possibility of amalgamating with the other
 if the land is to be sold they must surbands but they had refused to consider render their rights 49
