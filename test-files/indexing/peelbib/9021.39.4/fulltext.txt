 increase in settlers and 1903 town councils often received letters from trade as a reason for the urgent construction of

 seriously impeded the growth of edmonton the events of the past ten days emphasizes the and interest payments the town
 council hoped need for a traffic bridge across the saskatchewan the dominion government would give them a river communication has
 only been possible on grant of 24 000 acres which if sold at 1 00 per foot and this at

 there was still the problem of transtheir freight is considerable and the loss to settlers shipment not being able to

 to see if they consortium also had the backing of the town would at least extend the track to the
 southern council who agreed to purchase 50 000 of shares bank of the saskatchewan river but received in the company
 the estimated cost of the bridge negative replies although the cpr did say that if was 90 000 and they
 hoped the dominion govsome company could be prevailed upon to build ernment would come up with 75 000 the cornthe

 free of charge cost of building and operating the spur accordingly the town formed a street railway the dominion government
 seemed to be in no car company in 1894 the cost being estimated hurry to pass the legislation granting the
 charter by the canadian general electric company at so the town council sent mayor h c wilson 59 000 plus
 7 000 per year for operating costs and father albert lacombe to ottawa at the end 3 of february 1896

 minister m ouimet de required of the hudsons bay co is definitely cidedly hostile to the scheme his objections known

 had more success with donald speak to the minister concerned he was reluc smith who promised to meet with ouimet
 and tant to endorse the scheme submitted by the inform him that the hbc was not opposed to the edmonton
 businessmen because there was no railway scheme he also made it plain to mayor guai antee that either the town
 council or the wilson that the town of edmonton could expect edmonton district railway would carry the plan no financial
 support from his company to completion they had not submitted a deposi the mayor then went on to see sir

 it would also be no guarantee that the edmonton district rail willing to co operate by supplying rails and any
 way co would not sell it to the cpr or the c e other supplies required to build the spur
 at spe railway cial rates and also allow empty and loaded cars mayor wilson responded that a traffic bridge to
 travel on the new line however he was very alone was insufficient and they would sooner dubious about the whole
 project he thought the have no bridge at all than just a traffic bridge he proposed spur to mill creek
 would be too cxalso assured ouimet that as soon as the charter pensive and estimated the cost of the valley
 seewas passed the town would def initely make the tion alone at 80 000 50 000 available he was surprised
 to learn of mayor wilson s efforts were rewarded as a the objection of the hudson s bay company as

 would be bound i southerly to connect with the c e railway by the restrictions that the government placed at

 wilson was so angry about the opposi to stoney plain tion from the hudson s bay factor who had 3

 advertiser the writer as an american citizen and one who is immensely proud of that fact could not but notice
 with feelings chiefly of amusement and partly of regret the fact that during sir wilfrid laurier sl recent visit certain
 denizens of macleod felt called upon to haul down the few american flags which at first had been put up
 around the public square the privilege of hauling down an american flag is one which has never been given to
 britain or british subjects save in time of peace and possibly a childish love of a new experience may have
 inspired the action what loi d macaulay in speaking of literary rivalries calls the savage envy of aspiring dunces may
 also have its application to the international sphere nor were the distinguished speakers wholly in good taste in attempting to
 institute comparisons between canada and the united states always to the disparagenient of the hatter the writer has attended hundreds
 of political and public gatherings in the united states and never yet has heard any speaker draw any invidious comparisons
 between the two neighboring nations this may have been a mere matter of personal taste or may have resulted from
 the fact that internationally canada is quite inconspicious and negligible and hence did not engage the attention of the speakers
 macleod is situated on the borderland between the two countries hundreds of its citizens are americans and it certainly does
 not seem to the writer to be stretching the amenities too far to have found a place for the few
 american flags which it was thought necessary to tear down of one thing the writer is quite certain that a
 similar courtesy to the british flag and to the feelings of resident british subjects would never have been resented in
