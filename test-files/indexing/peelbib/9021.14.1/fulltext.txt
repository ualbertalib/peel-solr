 made by authors 2 00 a year david thompson on the peace river edited by hugh a dempsey david thompson
 employee of the hudson s bay company 1784 97 and clerk and partner of the north west company 1797 1812
 was one of canada s most famous explorers and cartographers with the kind permission of the ontario archives we are
 privileged to reproduce parts of thompson s original journals that relate to alberta in 1802 after completing a number of
 surveys and explorations along the north saskatchewan river and making a trip to fort william thompson moved to a n
 w co post about five miles up the peace river from its confluence with the smoky this is about ten
 miles south west of the modern town of peace river the post had been established by alexander mackenzie in 1792
 during his search for an overland route to the pacific thompson s journal reproduced here begins when he had already
 reached lesser slave lake he did not make any notes of the earlier part of the journey as he was
 probably following the same route he had taken in 1799 when he had travelled as far north as the mouth
 of slave river for his purposes further observations would have been unnecessary the entries in this journal are somewhat rougher
 than those of other journeys and a few words have been written over or are otherwise undecipherable these are indicated
 by a row of dots also as parts of the journal were kept primarily for meteorological purposes the detailed weather
 observations etc have been omitted the spelling is unaltered but in some places punctuation has been added for clarity any
 editor s additions have been placed in square brackets this journal ends part way through june 5 th 1803 when
 thompson left the fort to go on a hunting trip in our next number we hope to continue his account
 from that point in two earlier numbers we have reproduced thompson s trip from rocky mountain house to the red
 deer river in october 1800 winter 1965 and to the bow river later in the year spring 1965 nov 5

 englishman in alberta by h a mcgusty editor s note in march 1889 an englishman named h a mcgusty boarded
 the s s peruvian for his first trip to america during the next two years he wandered through manitoba and
 alberta with the hope of eventually settling down instead he returned to england where he entertained friends and acquaintances with
 stories of his experiences at last in response to several requests he wrote a manuscript two years in manitoba and
 the north west territory which he had privately printed in london only one or two copies of this rare pamphlet
 are now known to exist in this issue we are pleased to quote mr mcgusty s experiences in alberta as
 taken from a copy of the pamphlet in the glenbow foundation library i left oak lake manitoba for cal still
 it possessed many advantages gary on the 14 th february 1890 on lacked by many much larger towns in one
 of the coldest days we had had that england it is beautifully situated at winter we left at 8 o
 clock p m my the junction of the bow and elbow only companion for the first few miles rivers it
 has a good system of water was a very drunken individual who was works electric light telephones a well asleep
 in a corner 1 got lonely after a organized fire brigade good hotels etc time so went over and woke
 him up and considering that in 1880 the town and talked to him he had the most site was a
 howling wilderness or at disjointed conversation i ever heard and least that there were only two or three asked the
 most aimless questions after log buildings there the progress and the a bit the conductor came in and told him
 increase in the value of real estate have that he had passed his station that been simply marvellous and there
 is no made him fighting mad and he wanted reason why it should not increase to the to know why
 the i did not wake same extent again especially as this him before i had quite a lively time year
 1890 a new railway has been with him until we reached the next started to edmonton which has reached station
 where the conductor put him out the red deer river then i curled up and went to sleep i did
 not know anybody in calgary early next morning we passed regina except the two mounted policemen whom the capital of
 the north west territories i had travelled up with so did not feel but it was still quite dark about
 a very much inclined to stop in town so i dozen of the north west mounted police determined to buy
 a horse and ride out got in here they were under the com to a mr m to whom i
 had a letter mand of a sergeant and were going to of introduction his ranch was on the calgary amongst
 them i recognized a bow about fifty miles from calgary i young scotch chap whom i had known found a
 horse that suited me or at least in manitoba there was also another whose price 20 dollars did he was
 young chap whom i knew he like a about 12 hands high and weighed about great many others having failed
 for the 450 lbs i should think i stand about army and still wanting to wear a red 6 ft
 2 in and weigh about 12 stone and coat drifted into the police force i put a half and only
 possessed one eye on in the day pretty well talking to them which account i christened him polyand early next
 morning about 5 am phemus he was a genuine cayuse arrived in calgary light bay with four white legs and
 a calgary was a very rising town white face though the population was only 4 000 i mounted him and
 started about 12 11 o clock the snow was very deep so a warm wind which blows from the the
 travelling was very difficult and it mountains and which takes the snow was very cold going down to about 40
 away every now and then degrees below zero but i must mention that that winter was unequalled for dur but
 the chinook did not come and so ation and severity in the memory of the the cattle kept on dying
 and hay kept oldest white inhabitants i e for about on going up in price and the ranchers 10 years
 kept on stamping round and cussing till about the following april i only rode about 14 miles that after it
 was at begg s that i first became noon and put up at a stopping house for acquainted with the
 blackfeet begg the night next morning i started on himself can talk blackfoot like a native across country the snow
 was fearfully there were three old squaws who had deep and polyphemus had all he could made a permanent camp
 near his ranch do to get on at all however we had they used to do washing etc for him
 not gone many miles before we passed and he in return used to supply them the house of a mr
 d who came with some flour tea etc if they had out and very kindly asked me to come chosen
 to go on the stage they would in and stay a few days this was very have made their fortunes
 acting the kind considering that he had never seen three witches in macbeth there was me before i stopped with
 him three also camped near there a chief called days and had a very good time low horn and about
 three others these there were a lot of dead cattle op people and a great many other blackposite to his
 place for strange to say feet i came to know very well aftercattle do sometimes die though this will wards
 probably be news to the shareholders at the end of a week i went on down in the ranching companies
 and as a to m ‘ s i stopped there about consequence of the dead cattle there another week then
 on my way back i were a lot of coyotes over there too stopped with begg again for a few
 days coyotes are a kind of wolf which in then proceeded into town as i had to habits the prairie
 we went over one meet a friend in there i sold polypheday to try and hunt them but it was
 not mus a success next day two four horse teams came along bringing coal from as soon as the snow
 thawed i left calgary to the industrial school at high town and went out and stayed with a river and
 as that was in my way i young englishman h i made travelled on down with them i tied his
 shack my headquarters as i wanted polyphemus behind and we took it in to ride round and see the country
 so as turns to walk ahead and find the trail to know exactly where to locate when we got to
 the industrial school about i started my ranch 14 miles late that night but had to i lived with him
 about two months leave one waggon and hitch all the and rode around the country and looked horses to the
 other i stopped at the at it the horse i got suited me very industrial school that night and went
 on well he was very fast but too high next day next day i was passing a ranch belonging to
 mr alexander strung to be much good for stock i also got a mexican saddle and riding outfit begg he
 too asked me in he was the most good natured chap i met in the once i rode about 25
 miles south north west i stopped at his ranch west to see some land but i got lost about a
 week and had a first rate time and had to sleep out that night and it he had been in
 the country ten years rained hard all night and the next mornand said that he had never seen any ing
 i let the horse find his way back i thing like the cold or so much snow stopped at different
 ranches that sumbefore he was and indeed so was mer working for my board and learning everybody else i met
 expecting a chi how to run a ranch but i stopped most nook to come every day a chinook is
 of the time at begg s ranch 12 a wrangler attempts to catch a horse inside a rope corral at
 a roundup camp in the 1890 s the author had amusing experiences connected with the breaking of such horses life
 on a ranch is rough but enjoy broke the next thing is to get the able perfectly free you can
 wear any saddle on this being done some bronco clothes you like and do anything with buster climbs on of
 course the bronco out bothering about who will see you bucks but its rider soon pounds all that but then
 you have usually to sleep on out of it and after two or three rides the floor with just a
 blanket under you it will be quite broken at least that is the way it should be done but i
 am there was always a lot going on at sorry to say it is usually a good deal begg s
 ranch breaking horses etc the more complicated than that way they break horses out there is very different from the
 methods used in the when for example some people who old country the horses are driven into are not quite
 so experienced start they a corral which is a circular enclosure do things differently the boss says to with a
 fence from seven to eight feet one of the men george or whatever high round it then having settled who
 his name may be will you do the is going to ride and what colt is to be roping don
 t mind if i do says he broken the next thing is to catch him he then gets his lariat
 and swaggers there are two ways of doing this the into the middle of the corral carefully simplest is to
 throw the rope round his coils the rope up in his hands gives neck and choke him down the more
 the noose a preliminary swing and says scientific is to rope him by the front he is ready the horses
 are driven legs and jerk him over at once having round he runs round too swinging the arranged these preliminary
 measures noose violently round his head it the man who is to do the roping steps knocks against the snubbing
 post in the forward and neatly throws the lariat centre of the corral and curls round his round the horse
 s front feet then hangs neck and he throwing it at the same on to the rope till the horse
 comes down time nearly gauks his head off then when somebody runs up and sits on its he stamps round
 and blasphemes till his head a hacamore is then fixed on and it eyes stick about three inches out of
 his is let up it is then dragged round by head and two of the mares faint and the hacamore
 till it is considered halter have to be carried out then george has to be untangled we stand round and
 grin and shout and the business starts again he swings stay with him hang to him stick his rope more
 carefully this time throws your spurs in and other remarks of the and hits the horse across the knees same
 kind to him then he curses the lariat says he would have got him that time only the noose at
 last the bronco getting tired of did not open next shot he misses again bucking starts to run and he
 and the herder who is also mounted and who then an indian squaw who has wandered up in the meantime
 and is looking is supposed to follow and see that the through the side of the corral remarks bronco does
 not run over a cut bank napiquoin moxinum white man no or get into trouble disappear across the good george
 nearly has apoplexy at prairie this the squaw placidly grins at him i have been on a bucking bronco at
 last just as no one is expecting it once or twice and it is the most fearful george does catch
 the bronco by the sensation i ever felt after you have fore legs the colt plunges round the been on
 a few minutes you don t know corral george flies round after him which is your head and which your
 heels or what your name is or how old hanging on to the end of the rope and yelling come
 on you d fools and you are all you feel is an indistinct hang on don t stand there like
 a lot of impression that one end of your spine boiled owls and everybody else too is sticking out about
 four inches and much surprised to think of stopping still bumping against the saddle and that tears round after him
 the other is sticking about the same distance into your brain and is working at last the bronco is thrown
 and about in there after he has been halter broken is saddled then comes the momentous cattle of course are
 the most imquestion who is to ride portant things in the north west they are turned out on the prairie
 all summer it then turns out that nearly every and rounded up in the spring and fall body has something
 the matter with him in order to brand the calves etc some it is at times like this that one
 finds out ranches do not even feed them in the what fearful and noxious diseases your winter branding the calves
 is nearly as friends whom you had probably con exciting as breaking horses the cattle sidered perfectly healthy are suffering
 who only see a man perhaps twice a from i myself say that i could not risk year are naturally
 as wild as deer and my life as if some dozen other people it is very dangerous to go near
 them on were to die there would be no male left foot of my race or name everybody jeers at
 i remember once i had brought in this saying that if they were not suffer some fifty head of tame
 cattle and put ing from these terrible maladies they them in the corral and knowing them would enjoy nothing more
 than a ride to be quite tame i tied my horse outside on that particular horse the ccrral and went
 in on foot but at last some benighted idiot volun there happened to be a range cow in teers to
 ride and climbs on the bronco there which i had not noticed i wanted bucks backward forward sideways and to
 cut out some cattle that were required round in a circle his back arched and and to let the rest
 go i was just opening his head sticking out between his hind the gate when on looking round i saw
 legs while the poor devil on his back that cow within three feet of me and clings to the horn
 of the saddle and coming for me red eyed i skipped looks as if he would give all he out
 and ran round that corral faster possessed and a darned sight more to than i had ever run before with
 the b e sitting peacefully on the prairie yet cow just behind me the worst of it was though the
 bronco is doing everything another chap was looking on roaring he knows to help him to do this and with
 laughter and shouting ‘ run you though all he has to do is to let go he long legged devil
 two to one on the does not do it cow etc at last i made a jump for 14 branding
 time meant plenty of work for all hands on the ranch during this stay in alberta the author had many
 opportunities to participate in such activities this view is on the wairond ranch in about 1893 the side of the
 corral and got over i the cattle out there are very much went in on a horse next time the
 same as in the old country the usual kind of bulls turned out with them being there are two ways
 of branding durhams herefords and polled angus one way the cattle are driven through the most noticeable thing about the
 a kind of narrow passage called a chute cattle is that only about one cow in one panel of which
 can be pressed down three can boast of more than six inches on the cattle this holds them and the
 of tail the rest having been frozen off brand is then applied it is an iron it looks very funny
 to see a cow trying which is hot enough to burn into the to flick a fly off the end
 of her nose with skin a six inch tail the other way is for two men to ride the flies
 in the country are to use into the corrals one of whom ropes the a western phrase a caution to
 snakes calf by the neck the other by its hind mosquitoes there are in thousands but legs they then throw
 it and another they are too well known to need any man sits on its head whilst a fourth mention
 but there is another variety brands it out here called a bulldog he is about the size and has very
 much the appear another exciting kind of work is ance of the drone bee he is a most cutting out
 i e separating certain bloodthirsty villain he will bite a piece cattle from the band you ride into the out
 the size he wants fly on to the band and follow the one you want to nearest fence post and
 eat it he very get out and gently drive it out of the seldom gets a good chance to bite
 a band as soon as you have got it out piece out of a man but between him it naturally
 wants to get back you have and the mosquitoes the cattle have a got to keep between it and the
 herd lively time it will start to run and those cattle can run nearly as fast as a horse then
 will about the end of september 1890 i suddenly stop and turn your horse does and two other fellows started
 on an likewise and so on until you get them expedition up to red deer a small separated from the
 herd settlement on the red deer river about is 95 miles north of calgary we took guns citortiswith us and
 had some very good shoot and the tenderfoot cusses his luck ing on the way we also took my dog
 and feebly murmurs ahl mars we had three horses two tents the blooming country s a fraud which we packed
 on to a demccrat and i want to go home to ma which is a four wheeled rig two of
 us drove in the democrat the other one then they set him chopping wood rode we took the riding in
 turns when it s forty five below he aims a blow at a log we left calgary about half past
 and amputates a toe twelve on a very cold day for september and travelled 22 miles that day cltortts after
 we got about five miles from cal and the tenderfoot etc gary we left the last house behind and travelled
 on along the edmonton trail he mounts his fiery cayeuse across the most dreary looking bald and thinks he will
 flourish around headed prairie i ever saw about half but the buzzard head starts to buck past four or five
 we reached a stopping and lands him on the ground house near which we camped as we c iorttsshould have
 had to go on about 12 miles and the tenderfoot etc etc etc before striking more water the grading for
 the new edmonton railway was we then unrolled our blanket and about three miles west of us we pitched made
 our bed the tent picketed the horses carried everything into the tent fixed up the h mars and myself slept
 in stove and then found that we had for one tent g in another little a gotten to bring any
 wood now we had tent in a few minutes we were in bed had nothing to eat since leaving cal
 and nothing broke the silence except gary and it is simply wonderful how the horses munching the grass quarrelsome the
 m o s t good natured people get when hungry so of course next morning we started about halfwe quarrelled
 and cussed each other past eight having used the last piece pretty freely but at last we found a little
 of wood to cook breakfast after we had wood which had been left by some gone about five miles the
 road began former campers the place we were to snake across the railway grade and camped in being a favourite
 half breed we saw some grading camps the first camping ground so we cooked supper house we came to was
 a stopping house and after supper we sat round and about 15 miles from our camping ground smiled and we
 all talked to mars and near there i met a stony indian who made him feel perfectly happy until he
 told me there were lots of duck on a went and sat near the stove and rested small lake which
 we were going to and his tail against it then he gave a yell just beyond there we struck a
 boand rushed through the side of the tent nanza that is to say we found a sack and scared the
 horses containing a lot of wood neatly cut up and a ploughshare we agreed that as then h brought out
 his banjo we did not want the ploughshare we and sang amongst others he sang this would leave that which
 we accordingly song to the tune of life on the ocean did taking the wood and the sack with wave
 us we agreed that the man who had lost it if he came back would think that life in a
 prairie shack we were very honest thieves we moved on a few miles farther and stopped for oh it s
 life in a prairie shack dinner we did not unpack but lighted when the rain begins to fall a fire
 on the ground and cooked slapjacks a kind of pancake but made it drips through the mud on the roof
 only with flour baking powder and and the wind comes through the wall water we rested an hour then went
 on 16 at the time the author travelled along the calgary edmonton trail in 1890 only a few stopping houses
 marked the advance of civilization this view from the trail was taken near the blindman river crossing in 1886 about
 five miles past another stopping went to bed and to sleep i was house and then we left the edmonton
 awakened by h who made a trail and struck out across the prairie jump over me to the door i
 asked hini for some lakes that lay north east what was the matter he said that he was lying half
 asleep when he saw we steered by the compass as of something which he took to be a man s
 course there was no other way of steer arm reach in and take out a gun he ing and none
 of us had ever been there made a jump at it and found it was before we had to travel
 slowly as the mars i asked what the dickens he prairie where there are no trails is very thought the
 dog could want with a gun poor travelling h was riding he said he didn t know but supposed ahead
 and he came to a small coulee he wanted to shoot a horse anyway he and shouted to us to
 bring a gun as he would hate he said to be round when saw a badger sitting there as he
 the dog was fooling with a gun then shouted an eagle got up within twenty we blinked at each other
 and were just yards of him and flew away about an going to sleep when we heard one of hour
 after that we came to a creek we the horses neighing and as it kept on stopped there and gave
 the horses a as if calling for the others we got scared drink while h rode on i walked and
 went out and sure enough there along the creek to see if i could find a was only one horse
 there so we woke place 10 cross and shot three ducks up g and took our guns and h came
 back and told us that the roamed round the prairie with nothing lakes were only three miles further on on
 but a flannel shirt we found the so we crossed the creek and drove to horses which had broken their
 picket them we camped on the west shore of ropes and strayed off about half a mile the biggest one
 we could not help laughing at each next day g went for some other we looked so cold and miserable
 wood with the team about ten miles standing round in that light attire and north and h and i went
 shooting each armed with a shot gun but did not get much only some fifteen we stayed one more day
 after that ducks between us we met a half breed then started on for red deer we left that day
 who was hunting horses about 20 ducks behind and brought on that night we got rather a scare about the
 same amount on the way during supper mars rushed out two over we shot some chicken one covey or three
 times and chased something i saw and walked up to it and put them probably a kit fox after supper
 we up before shooting g asked why 17 i did not shoot them sitting i said it sisted of three
 waggons and 16 red river was more sport to let them rise he said carts there were only three drivers
 oh d n the sport that comes in with them a man and his wife in the when you re
 picking them up and cer first waggon and two young men one tainly there is great sport in picking a
 about 16 the other 18 they were lot up when you are hungry mounted we came down the same way
 we went up and came again to the a little before we got to lone pine three small lakes we
 stopped there two we began to see bluffs of trees which days and then had to come down to calgot
 thicker till we got to red deer where gary as we were played out of grub there is a lot
 of timber we camped one we had rather better sport this time day between the lone pine and red i
 got 12 ducks at one point in about half deer we got to the latter place about an hour but
 the shooting was not at all 12 o clock and borrowed a wagon to good as we had gone up
 about a month get our things across the river as we too early and the northern duck had were afraid
 they would get wet in our not come down the day we started from rig here also we gave away
 most of the lakes the weather which up till now our duck and chicken we got across had been glorious
 broke and we had the red deer safely it is fine broad to start in a kind of sleeting rain
 and stream not quite so swift as the bow a high wind however we got on all we travelled on
 over a very rough road right and camped next night at the same through the brush to a place called
 place 22 miles from calgary we burnt lake we camped near a sheep finished all the provisions that night and
 ranch on the lake after supper h started next morning and drove into and i went up to see the
 people at the town we got there about two o clock ranch we sat down and talked they thus ended
 the most enjoyable fortnight told us that the year before last six i ever spent black bears had been killed
 on that lake we told them that we had a man perhaps the best sport to be had on eight
 feet four down in the camp whom the prairie is the coyote hunting the we used to curl round the
 tent to keep coyote is a kind of wolf which lives on off snakes they told us they knew a
 the prairie it is a grey coloured longman who had climbed up a tree after a egged kind of creature
 and very fast lynx and killed it up there with his the best way of hunting them is with hands
 we had nothing to beat that greyhounds or scotch deerhounds as so we adjourned these dogs are almost as fast
 as a horse and any other kind of dog would be next morning we moved camp about left behind of
 course out on the prairie three miles to where there was a small there are no hedges or jumps of
 any stream running into the lake kind it is just a fast gallop all through a full grown coyote will
 give you a we camped at an old cree camping splendid run of four or five miles someground they had
 left a lot of teepee times and will often turn and stand off poles piled there there was also an
 the dogs when overtaken indian sick house there these sick houses are oblong shaped constructions cowboys sometimes c a t
 c h the of willow stick bent over and interlaced coyotes with a lariat but a coyote is a just
 large enough to hold a man in very hard thing to rope as even when which the sick indian is
 placed and in you shy the noose round him he wriggles which he takes a kind of vapour bath through
 somehow we camped here some days so built a regular fire place in which we might the buffalos are now
 practically extinct but at one time they must have cook bannock etc been there in enormous numbers as you in
 a few days we started again for cannot now ride any distance without home crossed the red deer in our
 own seeing several heads and skeletons lying rig whilst crossing we saw a half breed on the prairie and you
 can still see freighting outfit crossing too it con their tracks worn deeply into the ground 18 you can also
 see their wallows circular and rationed consequently the occupahollows about two feet deep in the tion of the men is
 gone the women centre and five feet acrcss these wal however still have their same occupalows were made by the
 bulls when the tions the children are lively cutelies were bad they would then lie down looking little things with
 twinkling on their side and work themselves round black eyes they usually begin to ride till they had made a
 soft cool place to at the age of five lie in their dress before the advent of the in the
 north west probably no race white man was composed of skins and of people has been so differently de they
 still have a very good though slow scribed as the indians i always found way of tanning skin now it
 is comthe blackfoot indians a very quiet posed mostly of blanket and cotton cheerful simple minded people and though they
 still have in most cases an quite as honest as their white neigh elaborately beaded outfit of buckskin bours on
 the average there were of for state occasions such as pow wow course some black sheep etc a woman once
 showed me a dress the men are tall slimly made and for which she said she had given a rather
 fine looking men nearly all good horse runners and horsemen and some of them the dress of a man now
 a days good enough shots with a rifle the usually consists of a cotton shirt a women are shorter thicker
 set and as breech cloth round their loins and a pair a rule uglier than the men though i of
 long blanket leggings reaching up to have seen some who were decided ex their waist and fastened to their belts
 ceptions to this rule one hears a great these usually have a wide flap left at deal about the way
 the indians make the seam over all they usually wear a their wives do all the work this is not
 blanket and they have a very dignified really so before the white man took his way of folding that about
 them they country the indian lived by hunting wear their hair long and occasionally and in consequence was away all
 the sport a feather in it they are very fond day the women stayed at home and of having the
 skins of ermine or mink did the cooking drew water etc and no one who had tried would say that
 the author had an opportunity to meet and that was harder work than hunting study the blackfoot indians who worked
 or now of course the white man has camped near the large ranches below in their regalia are white headed
 chief and wife left driven the game from the country and and wolf chief and wife all members of the
 the indians are confined to their reserves blackfoot tribe 19 hanging to their blankets and usually without blowing down they
 are also wear several necklaces of beads some very easy to put up they are pitched of the older men
 are able to wear scalps as follows three poles are tied together of which they are of course remarkably near
 the top and set up then other poles proud some of the younger braves being are laid against the forks
 of these so unable to obtain these in these days of as to form a circle their bases being effete
 civilization wear horse hair about two feet apart on these canvas is spread which is fastened down in one never
 sees an indian going bare front by skewers an opening is then fcot even the smallest children wear left at
 the top for the smoke to get out little moccasins these moccasins are a and another round hole for a
 door over sort of shoe made of soft buckskins which a blanket is spread on two sticks fitting close to
 the foot those of the there is a sort of dada round the edge men are elaborately beaded thcse of
 which greatly increases the warmth a the women usually plain small fire burns in the middle of the floor and
 the tepees are always warm the women wear a long loose kind even in mid winter the indians lounge of
 robe reaching below the knees made round the edge of the circle or lean usually of thin cotton round their
 waists against reclining chairs these chairs they have a leather girdle about three are very simple of construction being inches
 wide and covered with beads or simply back the ground acting as seat brass headed nails they also wear short
 leggings reaching only just above in these tents an indian family will the knee and frequently showing the live and
 apparently live very happily bare legs when the wind lifts their his dogs lying outside and his cayuses dress which
 is extremely painful to a ponies graze round never wandering modest man like myself they wear far from camp an
 indian is a perfect moccasins and over all a blanket hand at camping out and naturally neither they nor the
 men wear hats loves wandering about anyone who nor vary their custom for the winter like me has camped out
 on the lonely they are extremely hardy and do not prairie far from the haunts of man can seem to
 suffer much from the cold even hardly imagine any more perfectly enwhen it is 40 degrees below zero the joyable
 life than that minus such drawmen it is true sometimes wear a soft backs as the tent blowing down not
 felt hat but it is solely for ornament being able to find wood or water or and they usually cut
 the crown out the horses breaking their picket ropes the children according to their sex and straying off about ten
 miles and dress exactly like their elders in mini then refusing to be caught these little ature things never happen
 to an indian therefore i do not think the indians will the dress of all indians is composed ever turn
 into ordinary hard working of the brightest colors they can get farmers at least not until that time when they
 are not however glaring as they the lion will lie down with the lamb usually have a neutral shade of
 dirt the nearest approach to it that they the women usually show considerable make is horse breeding and i certainly
 skill and taste in the beading which they think the government might help to work altogether they look very pic
 make them a great deal more prosperous turesque by supplying them with a good stallion on each reserve as at
 present their their dwellings are pointed tents ponies are small owing to the misercalled tepees these tepees are by far
 able little native stallions they have to the best and most convenient kind of keep tent i have ever seen
 there are no ropes to break one s neck over no pegs the indian tents add greatly to the to
 come out in the middle of the night picturesqueness of the landscape as and let the wind in and perhaps

 some years the indian horses or cayuses are ago scalped a whisky trader now this scrubby little animals from 12
 to 14 gentleman had no hair on the top of his hands of some of the most unearthly head but
 had a good supply on his colours mostly extraordinary kinds of chin so they had to scalp him there piebald
 with greyish blue eyes which rather a grim joke f or the whisky trader give them an uncanny look but

 and put them nevertheless a wonderful power of en in the oven to get dry he forgot about durance and
 can travel immense dis them and shortly afterwards made up tances on very little food the indians a hot fire

 would in a great measure account for will turn black and shrivel up so when their size this is also

 them out they would have been most of all to inbreeding a tight fit for a child of five the

 looking and behind travoys are used for both inexpressibly handsome young man horses and dogs and are the only kind
 another fellow translated it a longof cart used amongst the blackfeet both legged silly looking son of a gun but
 men and women ride the same way i don t think it means that i did not one leg on
 each side and use very short like the name much as it led to the stirrups which contrast forcibly with
 the fellows on the ranch calling me spittoon long ones used by the cowboys another noticeable thing is that they
 mount on i do not know anything about the the off side indians seems to treat their government of the
 indians and can give animals very well and never over ride no statistics to show whether they are a horse
 in fact i do not think they are dying out or not but i should think they a more cruel

 s young when i arrived in edmonton early in 1870 it was the chief post of the hudson s bay
 company in what was known as the edmonton district and was the great provisioner of the fur trade the boats
 that annually descended the saskatchewan river to norway house were loaded with bags of pemmican bales of dried meat and
 bags of tallow which were needed to supply the boatmen etc employed in the transport work in the districts where
 provisions were scarce or unobtainable fort edmonton was in those days quite a little town within the stockades of the
 fort there were some forty or fifty men in the fort some employed building boats some as blacksmiths and a
 great many in hauling in provisions to feed those in the fort and their families buffalo were to be found
 to 1870 not more than sixty miles south from battle river to the boundary line the country was thick with
 them and buffalo meat was the staple diet at edmonton flour was a luxury and was nearly horses that supplied
 the power for the all hauled overland from fort garry mill would be hard to duplicate in the hudson s
 bay company had a small edmonton today some of them were farm at edmonton and raised potatoes raised in the
 country and others were turnips barley and wheat there was american horses stolen by the blackfoot a very good stone
 mill inside the fort and sold by them to the hudson s bay run by horse power but the amount
 of company others who were then living wheat raised was small a clerk in the in fort edmonton were william
 l wood employ of the hudson s bay company kenneth mcdonald who was saddler got two hundred pounds of flour
 a year and made all the ox and horse harness allowed him and had the great privilege that was used
 and charles gauthier of buying two hundred pounds more a outside of the fort the men i can recall laborer
 got no allowance of flour as a were daniel noyes english charlie rule but was allowed to purchase fifty mr
 beaupre later of fort saskatchewan pounds at the officers mess in fort and gilbert anderson james gibbons edmonton two small
 cakes about two was wintering at fort garry while john inches in diameter were allowed for norris was living at
 victoria mission each person there was always an kenneth mckay known as pig kenny extra cake put on for appearance
 sake was the keeper of a large number of and it was a sure sign of a tenderfoot pigs that
 were kept up by the hudson s or a moonias to eat that extra cake bay company i have read
 about the but if the ration of flour was small pigs that they used to have in ireland it was
 made up in meat each man being that could run like greyhounds they allowed six pounds of buffalo meat a

 the river at the forks of the farm and was also head miller the the pigeon lake trail next morning
 22 which of us knew least about the job mr groat said he knew how much powder was required and
 i said if he knew that i would warrant the right charge of ball but i found out mr groat
 was not quite sure whether it was one pound or five of powder that should go in and as i
 had equal doubts of the quantity of ball we did not weigh either but guessed at both ‘ 7 we
 erected a barricade of carts before one of the gates and behind that placed the cannon if the blackfoot got
 across and stormed the fort and burst in at that particular gate we were to fire our cannon i am
 not of a blood thirsty disposition and i never wished to kill anyone except the indians who shot my dog
 don in 1885 but i must confess i have always had a feeling that i would have liked to have
 seen the effect of one shot out of these cannons after all the scare was over we fired one off
 where the charge went i do not know in fact i did not look it was dangerous enough in the
 rear for the cannon ran back about twenty feet harrison s young kicked clean off the carriage which it wrecked
 and made a report that must takoots came into the fort and told us have been heard for miles we
 decided all about it and there was no one except that we would draw the charge out of a woman

 john mcdougall it was the spring of 1874 my husband and his brother david mcdougall had left us at morleyville
 for a hong dangerous journey into montana to obtain supplies for the coming year their objective point being fort benton
 on the mis souri river the date of the start was april 6 th well do i remember the time
 it was a beautiful day the season was early and the wild crocuses and the still wilder gophers told us
 that spring was now here but our hearts were sad for here we were two lone white women in a
 great big wilderness mrs david mcdougall and i were the only english speaking people now left in the bow river
 valley and for miles on every side our husbands and their party dis oh i can tell you those were
 anxious appeared over the high foot hill and times but as our husbands had hoped we were intensely alone we
 knew the the stonies under god watched over us dangers of the trip were many and con and some of
 them forever hovered near stant hostile tribes mountain rivers our mountain home as our guardsmen and wild animals were all
 along their and knowing this the other tribes let course and our anxiety for their lives us alone to them
 the stony was a and safe return was great determined foe as also a strong ally most of this time
 we were without either then we knew that there was also vegetables or flour buffalo meat fresh constant danger at
 home all of us dried or in pemmican was our diet were running great risks but our trust sometimes we
 got a duck or a prairie was in god and the stony indians my chicken and occasionally some venison husband
 always had great faith in the bravery and pluck of the stonies he the nearest approach to civilization would say
 if we can win their con on one side of us was edmonton and on fidence and they stand by
 us we can the other fort benton in montana both hold our own against all the other very isolated and
 far out on the frontier tribes at this time as for myself i had strong faith in some incidents stand
 out in my john everybody called my husband john if he and his brother could memory as occurring at this
 period of leave us to the human care of these wild our isolation we one day planned a mountain stonies
 we as dutiful wives picnic down into the valley and as all believed it was all right at any rate
 of the trained horses were away on the we must have supplies my husband trip and we had no wagon
 we caught was building a mission and had to have up an old superanuated ox and barmaterial his brother was
 trading and nessed him into an old cart the children mrs david and i climbed into the building and he
 had to have supplies cart and we set out on our way over the fort benton was the nearest possible
 foothills and down into the valley it supply point this was a 900 mile round was a glorious day and
 the world was trip with oxen horses and mules and beautiful we were young and neither heavy freight wagons and
 carts they the slow step of the old ox nor the would at the quickest be two months squeak or
 shake of the old cart did away the days would pass slowly and in the least mar our fun roughly
 but the nights drag out lonely and long gleefully we rolled and tumbled and and we would have no tidings
 from shook behind our stately stepping ox them until we reached the bank of a small 26 creek down in
 the valley here we proceeded to light a fire which on account of a breeze springing up caught the grass
 and all at once we were in danger from a big prairie fire of our own creation after a struggle
 we managed to save the cart and ox but not without the latter being somewhat singed this adcident in measure
 spoiled our picnic and sent us back up the long hill an anxious little party for the fire continued to
 run with the wind we could not help but think that if the wind changed that our fort and our
 home and belongings would be in danger as we were in the edge of the forest land all that night
 mrs david and i watched the fire and we made quite a night journey on foot for the purpose of
 satisfying ourselves as to the situation however to our great joy the weather changed and rain fell before morning putting
 the fire out early the next day chief jacob one of mr mcdougall s greatest friends and one of nature
 s noblemen came to see what caused the fire and to find out if we were safe the author mrs
 john mcdougall is seen another incident was a wild drunken here at left in 1886 others are rev john row
 which was gotten up by a french mcdougall young morley mcdougall and mrs mixed blood who unknown to us had
 george mcdougall brought some liquor from edmonton while this row was going on we were in constant terror and did
 not know number and we felt safe as it was poswhat moment would be our last the sible to be
 at that time the very next blackfoot who got the liquor were day our joy was increased by the uncrazy
 with it and all were armed either expected arrival at our fort of mr with guns pistols or bows and
 quivers mcdougall s father and mother and also full of sharp shod arrows as there his sister mrs wood were

 temperament always looked on the edmonton and mr mcdougall who had bright side thus we cheered each other just returned
 home an hour or two earlier that evening and waited and waited one day while we were thus alone my
 husband flung the door open and a small party of blackfoot indians came there they stood with all their paint
 and and camped just outside of our fort bigness in the flare of the light of our there were only
 three men and two lamp and kitchen fire of course we women in the number we hoped for women thought
 for the moment that we some stonies to turn up but before these would be murdered and then we arrived

 at them who had many reasons to hate our kind and they looked at john then one of faced the
 lone man who was hoping them spoke and praying for some way out of this when did you come terrible
 danger then the door opened and from out of the darkness it seemed just now john answered from nowhere there
 stood a little group and the blackfoot said you are a of young stonies strong man when do you sleep
 you for a moment the three parties are a great traveller looked at each other john reached out john laughed
 and answered yes his hand and welcomed the mountain i knew it was a mirthless laugh j eers the spell
 was broken the blackknew he was thinking hard and feeling foot relaxed and put their guns beside very solemn but
 still he smiled and them against the wall watched those blackfoot as they sat then the stonies told of the
