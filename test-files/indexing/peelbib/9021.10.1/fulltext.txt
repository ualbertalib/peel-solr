 two miles south of highway 18 and about midway between clyde corner and westlock lies a low hill part of
 the divide between the saskatchewan and pembina valleys over this hill one summer day in 1902 came young arthur edgson
 of thessalon ontario and knew he had reached his destination the open country that stretched to the spruce edged northern
 horizon must be little grande prairie the region had just been opened for homesteads but near the base of the
 hill were three small houses where joseph and ferdinand beauchamp and euclid leguerrier had already settled their families farther south
 of a rough cross marked the site of a future church and later the whole hill was taken by devout
 can adiens and that is why bill mackay not at all devout and as noted for his twisted jokes as
 for his great size named it protestant hill the name it still bears the first settlers after the quebec fam
 mrs edgson hands should be free to ilies were arthur jack and charlie push aside the brush tea might be
 car edgson who took homesteads also for ned but sometimes jack would make it their father and younger brother frank
 at some settler s shack with them came a neighbor named irwin the thick vetch that caught at their armstrong

 the near the stopping place he declared i d rather live in hell landing trail leaving that well worn road
 about twenty miles east of edgsons the land guide gave him a long cold stopping place look this low log
 house was the place then you can go to hell he replied where new arrivals met the edgson fam in
 the evenings the other edgsons ily and particularly jack edgson offi arthur charlie and frank took up the cial land

 almost totally deaf but man with the tousled hair and the bristi now and then inserted a word of agreeing
 sandy moustache showed land with ment anyhow all the fervor of a real estate agent as mrs edgson and her
 seventeen a group of men would often set off year old daughter lena got supper the on foot each with
 a small packet of good lady beamed on the land seekers lunch tied to his wrist by thoughtful through her
 silver rimmed glasses and miss garrison is the eldest child of the william garrison family she was a school teacher

 homesteaders were advised to have barely a dozen persons were present their mail addressed to edgson settle and they joined
 feebly as jack edgsori ment whether written edgson or sang a hymn in a clear firm baritone edson or edison
 this enabled any william garrison said a simple prayer passer by to bring the mail from egg read some texts
 and essayed a few lake over twenty miles away it never words of consolation then there was occurred to mrs
 edgson that anyone another hymn and the coffin neatly would disapprove of such casual handl made of rough lumber by
 mr edgson ing of his majesty s mail but she would and covered with black dyed cotton by have considered
 him unlikely to stay the women was lifted into the wagon long anyhow good settlers needed faith and driven away

 one s future with that of the the latter came from the same place prairie in illinois as the garrisons
 and william garrison allowed that he should nurse joe maloney and buckney harrison him showed their faith by building a
 store a half mile from the stopping place in you ll do nothing of the sort said j uly 1903
 when there were barely mrs edgson if anything happened to enough men for a raising ontario style you there d
 be your family to look after and not enough women for the dance jack will help he s single that
 should have followed there would never a suggestion that the garrisons be many such raisings in the next few and
 the ulms were no responsibility of years and it was bad form to miss one the edgsons nor that the
 edgsons had since no man could tell when his own illness of their own a community looked need of help

 the worst the relatives decided on a week and a second funeral was temporary interment handled as the first had
 been we can t just put him in the ground the widow decided to prove up her said jack edgson

 place grey phoid went no further haired at forty and quiet but firm in the settlers made hay in every

 the scarcity of the big genial young man was fluent women that none were too old or too in cree

 by their successors final treaty of peace edited by hugh a dempsey when the last great herds of buffalo were
 exterminated in the early 1880 s the nomadic indians of the northern plains were forced by hunger to settle on
 their reserves for the most part the changeover to the new way of life was a peaceful one but in
 some areas the indians were loath to give up their old conflicts of the buffalo days one of the areas
 where intertribal warfare continued was near the international boundary the indians soon found that by raiding for horses or scalps
 across the line they were almost immune from punishment if captured in canada with horses stolen in the united states
 they would not be charged unless the plaintiff came north to recover his horses and prefer charges often the horses
 were cayuses and the indian owners could not afford the expense of the long journey or their local indian agent
 might not give them a travelling pass with this invisible medicine line business of hunting and trapping but protecting them

 negotiations between the canadian and american governments too sir slow the indian agent for the bloods i have the honor
 to report that on william pocklington suggested a treaty sunday the 20 th instant red crow of peace between the
 warring tribes accompanied by crop eared wolf and this was a unique idea as there is no star child when
 returning from record of such an event having taken mcleod called in to see me and we had place before
 on an international basis a long talk concerning the young men anywhere in the west it is also signif i
 going to war more especially in the cant in that it was the last such peace gros ventres country red
 crow and the conference held between warring can others are of opinion the only way to adian and american tribes
 such settle this trouble between the bloods treaties had been arranged by the fur and gros ventres is to go
 over with a traders in the buffalo days so that the party of bloods and make peace with tribes would
 get down to the serious them he says that this is the only thing mr dempsey is archivist of the
 glenbow foundation calgary and editor of the review that will stop the young men from going to war i may
 say that i quite agree with red crow in this matter and unless this or something be done quickly we
 shall have bands of young men going across the line continuously i asked red crow how many bloods he would
 take with him should i agree to his going he replied he did not know and has promised me he
 will not start until after my trip to the sweet grass hills which will not be before the second week
 in april as the rivers are not very safe just now and the travelling very bad there being several large
 coulees to cross on the road i propose to take should you consider red crows plan a good one kindly
 send me a cypher telegram to that effect or otherwise as i understand the trains on the galt road are
 running very irregularly if at all 2 indian agent pocklington to indian commissioner april 10 th 1887 red crow head
 chief of the bloods was one of canada s outstanding indian leaders he is wearing his chief s uniform and
 has his treaty medal around his neck so soon as i know anything definitely will wire you 3 telegram indian

 that red crow party should make a treaty of peace with the gros ventres and contents noted i would inform
 you that i returned from visiting red crow yesterday we had a long talk about making the treaty red crow

 he replied about the half he went on to say that running rabbit was visiting friends on sun river and
 there he was waiting to hear from him as it was running rabbits intention to visit the gros ventres and
 that he would go with him red crow promised to give me a few days notice before he started i
 do not think they will go for the next ten days or so i had intended starting for the sweet
 grass buttes this week but today we are having a heavy snowstorm which will raise the rivers and make travelling
 too heavy 4 indian agent pocklington to indian commissioner may 23 rd 1887 sir i beg to inform you that
 about 9 am red crow missed about eighty head of horses the property of himself son son in law and
 brother in law he and a large party immediately started off as they feared the horses were stolen red crow
 quickly picked up the trail and followed it to the st marys which he crossed about half way between the
 mounted police detachments the trail police is about leaving for the maricis to recover a few of the police horses
 which are said to be there and at the request of red crow i have assented to his accompanying inspector
 sanders and taking two or three of his best men with him to endeavour to recover his lost horses and
 come to some understanding with the gros ventres if possible which will prevent difficulties of this sort occuring in the
 future i have also instructed mr pockhington indian agent in whom the bloods have great confidence to accompany the party
 anything which you can do towards agsisting our officers to recover the lost horses and to bring about a better
 understanding between the two tribes will i am sure be much appreciated by our government 6 letter capt william s

 good reputation for his work in the west he was outspoken in the support of his wards and did much
 to make their transition easier then pointed direct for fort assinaboine red crow sent his son in law to me
 stating he would follow the trail to milk river and so soon as he knew which way the trail took
 from there he would return take a large party and follow up his horses so soon as red crow returns

 necessity for your party to be deprived of their arms and to state further that he will esteem it a

 in his honour the lieutenant governor incharge informed me that the d divi troducing mr pocklington and myself sian horses
 which had been lost a short he invited us both to stay with him and time before had all been

 and benton as i had been in also the horses thirty five in number structed to do if necessary he
 could not hand me over the horses at once as he had to obtain permission on the 3 rd i
 passed inspector mc from departmental headquarters at st lucky s detachment at the writing louis before he could do so
 the tehe stones and camped about ten miles graph lines were all down and i further on after having crossed
 the milk found i should have to wait some time river i found near here the scene of before obtaining
 them the killing of the six bloods last fall by gras ventres mention of which i made i explained to
 major carroll that red in a separate report i crossed the line crow and the other indians wanted to on
 the morning of the 4 th make a treaty of peace with the gras ventres and assiniboines and that mr
 on the morning of the 5 th 1 came upon pocklington had come over with the a camp of u

 was decided that we should manding the camp is situated on the eastern side of the east butte of the
 go to fort belknap the gros ventres and assiniboine agency the next day sweet grass hills and consisted of two
 companies of the 20 th infantry and and a copy of an order directing a troop two troops of the
 1 st cavalry u s a from of cavalry to be ready at 9 am to escort fort assiniboine they
 are going to us to belknap was handed to mr pockstay out all summer and keep parties lington and myself
 in the evening i told mr pocklington he had better warn patrolling to the west of sweet grass the indians
 at once so that they would patrols to the east of the sweet grass be in readiness in the morning
 but it are sent out from fort assiniboine seventy miles distant i camped that night appears he never did so
 and much to fifteen miles further on my dismay i found at 9 am next morning june 8 th the
 indians had not been almost immediately after breaking warned and when i spoke to mr pockcamp next morning i saw
 a party of lington about it he seemed in no hurry mounted men crossing the prairie to to do so
 even then although acknowlwards us when they reached us i found edging it was his business to have done that
 it was a party sent out from the it the troop of cavalry after waiting camp i passed day before
 to escort us upwards of an hour went on without us into fort assiniboine the party con feeling in a
 manner responsible for the sisted of a sergeant and ten men they delay i apologized to the commanding requested me
 to have all the arms put officer and told him i had left it entirely in the wagons i enclose
 a copy of the in the hands of the indian agent who letter i received from captain mccasky had evidently
 forgotten to warn the inthe officer commanding at the camp dians an ambulance was placed at the on the subject
 he does not say why he disposal of mr pocklington and myself did not send an officer but the adju
 and we were accompanied by major tant at the post afterwards explained van valzter and lieutenant huston of to me
 that they were short of officers the 20 th u s infantry in the camp or they would have done
 so fort belknap is distant twenty eight that evening we went within twenty miles from assiniboine and we did not
 miles of assiniboine and were met by reach there till late in the afternoon we an officer and twenty men
 who escorted were received by major fields the inus into the post next morning june 7 th dian agent in
 a most courteous manner on my arrival at the post i reported it being rather late in the day the
 meetto the officer commanding major ing was postponed until the following been heard in regard to the horses so there
 was no help for it but to wait until things could be handed over on the 12 th indian agent
 major fields arrived in the post from belknap and i suggested to him and major carroll that as we would
 be unable to stay and prosecute the indians detained in the guard room and there being no court then at
 fort benton it would be better to let them go particularly as the indians had made a peace i recommended
 that they should be released on the request of red crow and major carroll agreed with me as it would
 show a disposition to let bygones be bygones on the part of the bloods major fields went to see mr
 pocklington about it and the indians were released and were told that they were liberated at red crow s request
 on the evening of the 13 th the telegraph line commenced working again and major carroll received an order to
 hand over the horses to me after purchasing rations and taking over the horses thirty five in number for which
 i gave a receipt we pulled out for fort macleod on the afternoon on the 14 th accompanied by an
 escort of cavalry with orders to see us across the line i cannot find terms to express the hearty friendly
 and courteous manner in which both mr pocklington and myself were treated by the united states officers stationed at fort
 assiniboine with the exception of having some trouble in crossing the rivers and experiencing very wet weather nothing to note
 happened during our homeward trip i returned via lethbridge to maclead which place i reached late on the evefling of
 june 2 1 st the indians left us after crossing milk river and went to the reserve with their horses
 i trust that the result of this expedition and the recovery of the horses will be of lasting benefit and
 will tend in a great measure to put a stop to the marauding expeditions of the bloods to the south
 and the southern indians to the north i may mention that i have been credibly informed that it is the
 intention of the sioux at the poplar river agency to make a raid on the blood reserve for morning june
 9 th i attach a verbatim report of the speeches made which i wrote down as interpreted i gave mr
 pocklington a copy as he taking part in the council was unable to take notes the understanding established was in
 every way satisfactory particularly between the bloods and gros ventres the assiniboines i fancy being a little sore owing to
 six of their number being in the guard room at the post the bloods received a great many presents from
 both tribes and everything went off harmoniously red crow and lame bull chief of the gros ventres agreed not to
 refer to the killing of the six bloods last autumn by gros ventres and all the other indians carefully abstained
 from doing so red crow expressed himself to me as being highly pleased with everything and he said he thought
 the peace would be a lasting one on the 10 th we returned to fort assiniboine i found nothing more
 had 4 i w ø 1 u z col gilbert e sanders served for many years in the mounted police

 aberhart had talked about an election ever since the backbenchers in his party fought his leadership in 1937 but now
 he could delay no longer the fiveyear term was up already he had stayed in office beyond the customary fouryear
 period in part because mackenzie king had done likewise in ottawa for it was an open secret that aberhart s
 strategy was to call a provincial election at the same time that the federal campaign was in process such a
 move would harass the opposition parties who would be campaigning against each other federally at the same time that they
 were campaigning together on a unity platform to oust social credit provincially 1 unfortunately the federal government had not even
