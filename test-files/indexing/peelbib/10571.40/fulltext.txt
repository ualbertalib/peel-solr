 4 the princess pat s written when the canadian regiment known as the princess pat s left for the front 
 a touch of the plain and the prairie a bit of the motherland too a strain of the fur trapper 
 wary a blend of the old and the new a bit of the pioneer splendor that opened the wilderness flats 
 a touch of the home lover tender you ll find in the boys they call pat s the glory and 
 grace of the maple the strength that is born of the wheat the pride of a stock that is staple 
 the bronze of a midsummer heat a blending of wisdom and daring the best of a new land and that 
 s the regiment gallantly bearing the neat little title of pat s a bit of the man who has neighbored 
 with mountains and forests and streams a touch of the man who has labored to model and fashion his dreams 
 the strength of an age of clean living of right minded fatherly chats the best that a land could be 
 giving is there in the breasts of the pat s edgar a guest editor s note this lovely poem was 
 written in 1914 and captured the unique spirit which carried our originals on to heroic deeds let us as their 
 successors continue to follow in their footsteps proudly

 6 the first battalion by lieutenant r romses 1976 1977 has passed with remarkable speed for the soldiers of the 
 first battalion it was a year filled with hard work action filled moments and professionally satisfying activities members of the 
 battalion participated in a multitude of activities ranging from training 0:train 0:ing as a professional and realistic fantasian force to 
 plodding through the frozen wastelands of the north in fort simpson n w t and churchill manitoba for all ranks 
 the highlight of the year was the presentation of new colours yes there were seemingly endless days of preparation for 
 these activities but the end result extremely successful events which made the heart stir in every member of the unit 
 and hopefully 0:hope 0:fully in the regiment another successful waincon 77 and before we realized it summer leave was completed 
 and the battalion s change of command took place ex medicine man vii charlie company participated in a battle group 
 exercise with batus british army training unit suffield in the barren wastes of suffield alberta in october 1976 joining in 
 the fun with c company were members of the argyle and sutherland highlanders the royal tank regiment and sub units 
 of royal engineers and royal artillery the exercise consisted of several independent live fire exercises in conjunction with armour and 
 artillery the whole series of exercises allowed us the opportunity to live work and sleep with live ammunition this was 
 the first time a canadian company had undergone training with the british at suffield and all phases of war were 
 covered it was an excellent training opportunity for all from the new soldier to the company commander the barren wastes 
 proved to be quite trying at times as snow frost wind and sand were evident throughout a chorus of cheers 
 arose from c company everytime a stick resembling a tree or a body of water was sighted you could hear 
 lt lambert lamenting cactus in canada as he picked needles from his deflated air mattress navigation bordered along the lines 
 of finding the north west passage ensuing arguments and beer wagering took place among our two notable pathfinders capt mike 
 columbus dillon and wo jacques cartier ritchie let s see now the sunrise is in the east i must be 
 going besides weathering the elements we were on three weeks hard rations which was quite a treat one of the 
 highlights of the exercise was ladies night the interested spouses of the men of c company came out to watch 
 a killing zone battle yes dear it is me i washed last week honest no we aren t shooting at 
 the poor brits an extremely valuable training exercise and one which members of c company will long remember c company 
 trained at suffield with the british in october l t bain giving orders to his section commanders during ex medicine

 7 glenbow centre opening a new page in western canada s determined move to preserve its cultural history was turned 
 with the official opening of the glenbow centre on september 22 1976 this marks the first time in the glenbow 
 alberta institute s 21 year history that all its departments are housed under one roof the eight storey structure in 
 calgary cost almost 9 million to build and contains an excellent military display a one hundred man honour guard from

 8 courses the battalion conducted many courses throughout the period september 1976 to august 1977 these were a pay level 
 4 driver wheeled course a communications course a sniper course a machine gun course a driver track course a pioneer 
 course a mortar course a pay level 5a course a pay level 5b course a pay level 6a course and 
 a number of tow conversion courses as well as defensive driving courses these were successful and provided the battalion with 
 the trained soldiers required to carry out its special roles here s a description of some of these courses c 
 n f courses began in the fall of 1976 clockwise from top left driver wheel course driver track course 5a 
 course 5b course 6a course and sniper course 
 9 combat leaders course 5b autumn of 1976 saw a company conducting combat leader course 7601 to qualify a platoon 
 of the battalion s junior ncos and senior privates to pay level 58 entailed in this course were the techniques 
 of leading a section in the field in internal security operations instructional techniques and heliborne operations good ot wainwright was 
 still there when the course deployed on their final field exercise to polish up on their patrolling defence routine withdrawal 
 operations and the daddy of them all the advance to contact although a pretty hard course both physically and mentally 
 all the candidates felt quite tall on their graduation parade under the command of the honour graduate pte gerry topham 
 of a company 6a course with senior ncos from a company combat support company and 2 ab cdo plus a 
 number of soldiers from a company to act as the enemy a company was in full tift conducting 6a course 
 7701 geared to train and qualify 40 master corporals to the rank of sergeant eight of these infantry soldiers had 
 made the trip from 2 ab cdo edmonton to be trained by the patricias besides being a refresher on the 
 skills of section leading the candidates went into detailed instruction in fieldcraft floating footbridges aid to the civil power explosives 
 air photos infantry armour cooperation and drill as with all military leadership courses it was a tough go with lots 
 of brainwork in garrison and exhausting physical work in the field but it was quite an achievement to have it 
 all behind you communicator course the commanding officer lcol foster was the first to admit it the pl 4 infantry 
 communicator course is one of the most challenging 0:chal 0:lenging and difficult courses available to the young soldier it is 
 also one of the more rewarding and necessary courses necessary because without it the battalion would soon cease to communicate 
 each year the battalion signal platoon conducts one or more courses each is designed to teach the infantryman the reason 
 for jimmy s existence from voice procedure to radio and line the students learned the detailed aspects of communications from 
 the very first day the would be communicator discovers that more is involved with communications than meets the eye sitting 
 in the back of a warm cp vehicle with a microphone in his hand and a gleam in his eye 
 is not the entire picture of a communicator with the course comes the realization that a heavy responsibility can and 
 does lie upon his shoulders for example it is not sufficient that he know how to talk on a radio 
 knowing what not to say is equally important during world war ii general kesselring of the africa corps was extremely 
 grateful to hear this beauty on one of our allied nets remember to go on radio silence by 2200 hrs 
 16 march needless to say our young soldiers take the hint of a lesson learned once the wrong way the 
 above statement alerted the germans and resulted in many allied casualties during their attacks on the mereth line the first 
 two weeks of the course tend to drag on as the students learn the must knows from voice procedure to 
 corn munications security boring it may be but their value is to be acknowledged at a later date suddenly just 
 as the confusion seems to be mounting the clouds disappear and everything begins to fit the practical aspects of line 
 and radio are found to be both interesting and informative now the voice procedure lessons are practised first hand on 
 the radio and the unwary linesman gets his chance to be snared the focal point of the course is a 
 week long field exercise designed to practise the students thoroughly in all phases of infantry communications 0:com 0:munications this time 
 the students descended upon the forest reserve west of the chain lakes area with no outside disturbances 0:disturb 0:ances the 
 students were able to consolidate the course material the mistakes they had been warned about were discovered firsthand 0:first 0:hand 
 such as misreading directions or composing messages when using the wrong side of the sheet aggravating isn t it imagine 
 the communicator s facial disturbance when he hears all stations this is 0 long message over while he is wading 
 his way through a swamp carrying the radio over his head and you still think the communicator s life is 
 the lap of luxury ask him sometime but be prepared to defend yourself on november 5 1976 the top two 
 candidates from each of the pay level 4 courses were presented with a certificate of military achievement by the co 
 congratulations are given to pte wentzell of b company and pte bokovay of a company both of whom passed the 
 signals course with flying colours the jimmy spirit displayed by these two made the race a close one with pte 
 wentzell winning the position as top candidate for the course in recognition of his efforts the signal platoon presented him 
 with their own plaque survival school one of the most interesting of the many training schools conducted by the battalion 
 in 1976 1977 was the survival school it was set up in february of 1977 in order to give the 
 individual soldier an idea of what to expect if caught in the situation of being stranded in the wilderness in 
 winter the instructional staff sgt jarbeau sgt clyke mcpl sarahs mcpl doucette mcpl currie mcpl vardy and cpl mackinnon set 
 up and organized the survival site just west of calgary in the bragg creek area one company at a time 
 went through the exercise survival emphasizing the basics was stressed each individual was taught how to build a lean to 
 with polyethylene or with a parachute sgt clyke the master of the trap line gave instruction on various types of 
 snares which the men then tried their luck with the men were also shown how to catch and skin a 
 porcupine some of the men were fortunate enough to snare a few squirrels and try their hand at cooking them 
 over a fire at the half way point of the exercise each lean to group was given a live chicken 
 with which they were able to test their ability at plucking and cooking once the instructional portion of the exercise 
 was over the candidates were allowed to wander through the wilderness at will and practise all the different techniques of 
 survival which had been taught all personnel at the end of the exercise gathered up their belongings 0:belong 0:ings and 
 headed back to calgary with renewed respect for the wilderness the candidates enjoyed themselves immensely and appreciated the opportunity to 
 use their initiative 
 10 warsaw pact school warsaw pact training was conducted by the battalion intelligence section from january 31 until february 24 
 1977 during that period lectures were presented on such topics as the warsaw pact soviet tactics individual soldier training in 
 the soviet union weapons and equipment of the standard motorized platoon company and battalion the bulk of the periods were 
 given by the intelligence section with the exception of two guest lecturer periods the training was successful and certainly provided 
 a sound background for the battalion s role of providing the enemy force for waincon 77 the intelligence section clockwise

 11 fantasian platoon in late september 1976 bgen st aubin commander 1 canadian brigade group directed the first battalion to 
 produce an aggressor force to be employed during waincon 77 this fantasian platoon would provide the opportunity for the brigade 
 to exercise their combat skills against a realistic foe 1 ppcli energetically undertook this task from october to february all 
 research was conducted by the intelligence section under lt lovell lt penman was appointed coordinator and developed a uniform and 
 weapon modifications the trade pioneers produced minefield markers and other signs which would be found in fantasian defensive positions sgt 
 major the armourer adapted the fn c 2 and smg to resemble warsaw pact small arms finally in mid march 
 1977 the enemy platoon was assembled thirty one of the best ncos and soldiers from a b and c companies 
 were selected the fantasian platoon commander was lt romses while the senior sergeant was sgt lewis and later sgt eisan 
 the platoon produced their own uniforms adapted their weapons with the modifications reorganized into a fantasian platoon organization and began 
 comprehensive fantasian training which even included language training maintenance platoon at this time was producing a modified apc to represent 
 a russian bmp eventually three bmps were produced visits to the platoon by the commander of mobile command and later 
 by the chief of defence staff kept the platoon very active the highlight of this total effort was playing the 
 role of enemy during waincon 77 this was done in two phases first exercise prairie jack with every company in 
 the brigade in turn attacking the fantasian platoon defensive position and secondly exercise prairie schooner with battalions from the brigade 
 and a british battalion attacking in turn a fantasian company defensive position the fantasian company was c company which included 
 the fantasian platoon and was commanded by maj crabbe the french grey cup background the first flag football competition in 
 1 ppcli was called the gold cup the trophy in fact made of wood was carved from a piece of 
 2 x 4 timber the first competition was in 1954 and the trophy was presented by capt muir the pioneer 
 platoon commander 0:com 0:mander to a company although there was no game in 1955 the battalion deployed to germany the 
 decision was made to have this event an annual competition the name was changed to the french grey cup for 
 the following reasons to commemorate the occasion when the regiment first went into the line alongside the french army january 
 6 1915 and when it subsequently relieved a regiment of the french army and in honour of the 3rd canadian 
 division with which the regiment served during world war i december 22 1915 to november 1918 the colour of the 
 divisional patch was french grey in 1956 the format of the festivities was changed to include a battalion parade in 
 any dress and to include a variety of floats at least one from each company in the battalion also introduced 
 was a miss french grey cup competition to be chosen from the queen that each company provided to decorate its 
 float the queen was to be a member of that company the original trophy was stolen in 1958 and was 
 replaced by the present silver trophy this silver trophy was donated by the commanding officer of the first battalion lcol 
 j c allan dso mbe cd the 1976 french grey cup was the 28th such competition there have been three 
 years without competition because of battalion rotations to and from operational tours in europe and cyprus b company had won 
 the cup for the previous two years this year s 1976 champion was a company training continued and included the 
 formation of a fantasian platoon the fantasians paraded for the cds the cds talks to the enemy platoon the top 
 two teams in the battalion s inter company flag football series alpha company the big red machine and charlie company 
 had been rivals throughout 1976 that is the way it still was after combat support company won the best float 
 award when bravo company got the most beautiful queen prize and when major general g g brown cd then senior 
 serving patricia and now colonel of the regiment kicked off the 1976 french grey cup football game between the two 
 rivals with private joe gosselin s touchdown and mcpl clay mac lean s convert the big red machine were not 
 only victors over charlie company with a score of 8 3 but pte gosselin was awarded the most valuable player 
 award even though not everybody can win an award special mention and thanks go to the coach of the team

 by combat support company at the fortress mountain ski area the job of preparing the school was a large one 
 skis were prepared under the guidance of the rqms mwo franklin gouges were filled and the skis waxed over a 
 two week period pioneer platoon was tasked to move four general purpose huts from wainwright to kananaskis and rebuild them 
 within a two week period under the capable direction of sgt nicholl the housing complex was ready on time and 
 by january 25th 1 ppcli ski city was ready for action all companies rotated through the school for a week 
 of skiing and an excellent learning experience was had by all exercise northern run c company was in churchill manitoba 
 for exercise northern run in march of 1976 this winter training included patrolling in the north and the construction of 
 all types of defenses to evaluate the effectiveness of both weapons and defenses the patrolling phase of the exercise went 
 well and many lessons were learned it seemed that the enemy put up just one trip flare too many for 
 8 platoon s recce patrol no mr lambert the 4th of july doesn t fall on march 9th 9 platoon 
 sent out mcpl eagle eyes douglas on their recce patrol the eagle was sure that he was being attacked from 
 the rear but the noise turned out to be cracking ice not the enemy while all this patrolling was going 
 on the transport nco mcpl boletta thought up a new way of staying indoors one quick slip on the ice 
 shortened his neck by an inch and put an unauthorized dent in the cab roof of his truck the support 
 staff did a marvellous job of keeping us going sgt smith the cqms went out of his way to get 
 the troops what they needed we finally had to ask him to tell his driver to stop attacking our snow 
 defenses with his skidoo pte benny our medics did a fine job throughout the exercise mcpl gross almost had to 
 treat himself for a nervous breakdown after all the worrying he did about getting home from churchill and off to 
 hawaii on time cpl mainville decided he couldn t cure company hq anyway so why not go and live with 
 the enemy capt polar bear dillon told us all a great story about the polar bear s seal hunting techniques 
 he will be glad to tell the story to anyone still willing to listen the second phase of the exercise 
 saw the platoons start on their snow defenses and with considerable hard work the job was completed on time company 
 hq personnel built their own trench the oc maj crabbe wasn t impressed with it so he put his reputation 
 and several bottles of beer on the line he concentrated the fire of a carl gustav and a 50 caliber 
 machine gun on the trench but couldn t punch a hole in it tough luck sir you should have trusted 
 our knowledge and past experience after the trenches were completed two days were spent attacking them although it was quite 
 cold the platoons did their thing and all went well after the attack of the 17th the company moved back 
 to the base camp to celebrate regimental day with some sports activities 9 platoon commanded by lt romses must have 
 been practising secretly because they came out on top company hq and 8 platoon still believe that mackennely and lt 
 pillar who organized the events were paid off by 9 platoon well mac is it true after the officers bought 
 a round the privates decided it was good time for a mutiny so they gave the chain of command a 
 snow bath one at a time the mutineers must have felt that the oc was a particularly dirty character because 
 he went for the treatment twice the cooks at cfs churchill baked us a tremendous cake complete with an apc 
 wo clark the station wo and mr buck delaronde a former patricia and resident of churchill joined us for the 
 festivities as the exercise drew to a close wo overton our csm refused to write off terrible teddy s winter 
 warfare pos and capt dillon finally found someone who would listen to his story about the bear in conclusion much 
 was learned on this exercise about winter warfare it even caused some of our finer minds to produce the following 
 poem while under the strains of the exercise sentry the race went on most of the night when all of 
 a sudden there appeared a light i was cold and hungry done caught a chill when the eyes of a 
 polar bear topped the hill mac donalds was open and i looked back the bear and i stopped for a 
 mac attack brought to you by shakey s frozen whale meat churchill manitoba q he was big and mean and 
 kind of white in nothing flat i was clean out of sight i ran so hard my mukluk froze but 
 couldn t stop he was tearing my clothes 
 13 ex bee sting ex bee sting was first conceived by capt d stevenson as a realistic training exercise to 
 generate enthusiasm and a realistic learning situation for the soldiers of bee company it was a deep penetration raid against 
 a fantasian industrial airport the airport just happened to be at red deer alberta each soldier carried his basic load 
 of ammunition one day s rations the clothes on his back and nothing else the attack force commanded by capt 
 bailey was choppered in behind enemy lines on landing the force immediately moved out under the cover of darkness and 
 closed in on the enemy airfield 0:air 0:field to destroy the runways there were three cratering teams each carrying 125 
 pounds of high explosive three search and destroy teams armed with maws were to destroy hangars and parked aircraft a 
 car bomb disguised as an mp vehicle raced up to the control tower with siren screaming and lights flashing it 
 cleared the enemy road block and parked alongside the control tower 500 pounds of high explosives simulated went off minutes 
 later another dull roar was heard as the airport fuel dump was hit the strike force disengaged and made its 
 way back to their rendezvous and were swiftly airlifted back to safety members of the calgary highlanders acted as the 
 enemy they despite tear gas and guard dogs suffered a severe thrashing the raid was a complete success and one

 the unexpectedly large turnout many spectators found themselves in slow moving traffic to the demonstration 0:demonstra 0:tion area caused by

 32 the second battalion lieutenant b n hall the second battalion returned home from cyprus in october only to be 
 skilfully ambushed by the officials of customs canada it is rumoured that the microfilm that they were searching for was 
 never found however i have it on good authority that it was held over at the venus theatre for five 
 weeks in any event the battalion quickly recovered from this administrative hiccup and proceeded on leave everyone was back to 
 work by the 15th of november at which time there was a general re organization of personnel within the battalion 
 in addition we started planning for our winter primary combat function courses the largest break in this routine was a 
 command post exercise northern passage in calgary where the chief comment seemed to be about the amount of static electricity 
 on the wall to wall carpets 1976 ended with the traditional christmas celebrations and a one day winter mini olympics 
 activities such as a cross country ski and shoot competition snowshoe races and a tent group race provided lots of 
 excitement for all those involved maj gen ware presented the trophies at a parade afterwards the new year started off 
 busily with the battalion conducting several more primary combat function courses during january 14 patricias went to wainwright for ex 
 rapier thrust v towards the end of february the battalion was honoured by a visit from the chief of defense 
 staff there was a slight delay when the cds was bumped at trenton he did however manage to hitch a 
 ride on the next day s flight and his visit went very smoothly from then on the month of march 
 was spent by most doing work ups and preparations for waincon 77 except for 100 people involved in a combat 
 leaders course all planning and the course were finished by the end of april and the battalion was fully deployed 
 in wainwright by the 3rd of may the first two weeks of waincon 77 were spent conducting section and platoon 
 level training section and platoon commanders could be seen talking secretively in small groups they were obviously engaged in heated 
 discussions and occassionally the words little green book could be heard gradually though the ideas of fire teams and pepper 
 potting were adopted and used effectively the weather was hot and personnel from headquarters company were observed walking about with 
 sandbags ready to attack any fire that started this practice was to prove very effective for the battalion s next 
 task operation balance the deployment to nipiwin provincial park in saskatchewan to fight forest fires on the evening of may 
 15th there were a lot of company smokers in progress when the beer started to run low unfortunately the messes 
 had already been closed by the commanding officer this was the first clue that something was going on subsequently the 
 various companies were briefed and told that the next day might bring a deployment to saskatchewan 0:saskat 0:chewan b company 
 quickly settled down to bed except for the rifle team who had been scheduled to fly home the next day 
 the rain started the next morning when the battalion received the order to move the activities of breaking camp and 
 the move to prince albert went extremely well and was a valuable exercise for the battalion naturally the rain followed 
 us up on the 17th of may we arrived in nipiwin it was still raining and set up our first 
 bivouac four hours later we moved to our final site the final few days of the operation were spent being 
 introduced to our guides and patrolling the burnt out forests we spent long hours attempting 0:at 0:tempting to extinguish small 
 smoke holes and underground fires oh yes it was still raining on may 22nd the battalion redeployed to wainwright the 
 next four weeks were spent in live fire and attack exercises up to the brigade level these proved to be 
 excellent exercises for the battalion to concentrate on their sop s and for all ranks to improve their teamwork after 
 waincon 77 and the clean up completed the battalion went on leave except for two groups the first group was 
 the rifle team which competed at the 1 canadian brigade group small arms competition the competition was extremely close with 
 our battalion finishing second behind third battalion we did send seven members to ottawa on the brigade team where the 
 regiment swept the matches at connaught ranges in ottawa the second group was alpha company which journeyed to batus in 
 suffield alberta to participate in a three week live fire exercise with the british army this exercise medicine man iii 
 was enjoyed by all ranks and was of immense training value to a company many soldiers commented you know tanks 
 seem to be a fairly good idea in a modern army the last two exercises to round off the summer 
 were northern viking and norploy participated in by bravo and charlie company respectively these hardy northern warriors spent a lot 
 of time practicing various patrolling skills and for c company sea sickness drills were prepared and written by the senior 
 nco s for the time which would be spent on ship september 6th brought about a large re organization in 
 every company and the battalion had a heavy fall training programme planned they say a picture is worth a thousand

 61 the third battalion lieutenant r e thompson the 1975 1976 patrician concentrated on the third battalion s tour in 
 cyprus which was considered at all levels of command to be a tremendous 0:tremen 0:dous success this patrician will report 
 upon the third battalion s activities commencing with the battalion s reorganization in work point barracks in victoria b c 
 in may 1976 and will close with a preview of the third battalion s 1977 summer taskings including both a 
 batus serial in cfb suffield and a company exchange with the australian army return from cyprus on 22 may 1976 
 the city of victoria officially welcomed 3 ppcli home from cyprus by inviting the battalion to exercise it s right 
 to the freedom of the city of victoria the ceremony took place on the lawn of the legislative buildings with 
 mayor young taking the salute and the inspection 0:inspec 0:tion when the inspection was completed and the mayor had officially 
 welcomed the unit home the battalion fixed bayonets let their colours fly and to the sound of beating drums marched 
 through the streets that same day other members of the battalion were taking part in armed forces day activities at 
 cfb esquimalt where they set up static displays depicting the many aspects of an infrantryman s life in the wee 
 small hours of sunday morning 18 july the quiet of several hundred patricia homes was shattered by the strident ring 
 of the telephone bug out surely they aren t serious on sunday morning a few short hours later a composite 
 company commanded by major brodie boarded a ci3o hercules at pay bay airport and headed for the olympics in montreal 
 their task was to provide additional security for athletes moving 0:mov 0:ing from the olympic village to the competition sites 
 the quartering of the first and third battalions in the same school made for a healthy relationship 0:rela 0:tionship in 
 which new patricia s met others and many friendships were made or reconfirmed the summer months gave the third battalion 
 it s well deserved leave both in reward for its tour in cyprus and in preparation for waincon 76 pany 
 was employed on perimeter security duties involving the manning of towers and routine patrols outside the prison after a couple 
 of weeks b company assumed the task and before the job was done most battalion personnel had taken their turn 
 the tasks and responsibilities demanded were not unlike those demanded of the battalion during its un peacekeeping role in cyprus 
 finally as tensions eased at the pentitentiary the company returned to work point barracks leaving one platoon behind to man 
 the towers until the battalion was eventually relieved in december all those involved in this operation are to be congratulated 
 on their professional attitude and fine performance sports battalion sports this year consisted of volleyball flag football ice and floor 
 hockey water polo and softball the sports schedule was adjusted on a regular basis to cater for individual leave and 
 battalion tasks the end result was a series of short schedules and final competitions support company commanded by captain mclean 
 proved to have a remarkable influence on the battalion sports programme winning the league trophy in flag football and the 
 play off trophies in flag football and softball headquarters company played consistently well during the season in the new battalion 
 sport water polo where they won both the league and play off trophies they also took the league trophy in 
 softball 0:soft 0:ball b company was awarded the cross country trophy for their excellent 0:ex 0:cellent effort in the cross 
 canada run a base esquimalt competition in which they placed first recce platoon easily maintained this cross country honour for 
 the battalion the battalion is looking forward to the return of macauley gymnasium to battalion control and the introduction of 
 a vigorous and challenging sports schedule in the fall of 1977 waincon 76 waincon 76 for the third battalion was 
 an extremely critical phase of training because it had been just over a year since the battalion had conducted live 
 firing under simulated combat conditions hence a refresher was needed waincon 76 provided that refresher in all weapons and successfully 
 confirmed individual combat skills through to small group tactics it was because of waincon 76 that every member of the 
 battalion realized that the ability of the unit to carry out its operational roles rests with each of us being 
 able to efficiently do our particular job in the field first as an individual then with others as part of 
 our team if we aren t proficient as individuals the detachment section platoon or company 0:com 0:pany cannot operate and 
 if these groups cannot function as teams the battalion will be unable to perform its mission in critical situations the 
 message here might sound more familiar when related as was done by lieutenant colonel leitch to the old proverb for 
 want of a nail the shoe was lost for want of a shoe the horse was lost etc waincon 76 
 did not end exactly as scheduled the battalion was ordered to send a company directly from wainwright to vancouver to 
 provide additional security at the bc penitentiary in new westminister a company commanded by major manning left its apcs in 
 wainwright and deployed by hercules to new westminister the com fall 1976 following waincon 76 both students and instructors undertook 
 their preparations for the fall series of unit courses the combat leader s course was garrisoned at the albert head

 instruction at albert head corporal pollock placed first of the 27 candidates to complete the course following the combat leader 
 s course these men remained together as a platoon under command of lieutenant thompson for exercise quick otter iv a 
 seaborne deployment exercise which was conducted 0:con 0:ducted on the west coast of vancouver island the aim of exercise quick 
 otter iv was to confirm operational plans and to introduce both infantryman and sailor to the requirements and capabilities of 
 each other the exercise was a joint success christmas in victoria is normally unlike most of canada with respect to 
 weather and 1976 was no exception the battalion hosted the officer s non commissioned officer s and men s children 
 to a giant christmas party and of course santa claus received a special invitation captain hill being all too eager 
 to comply a 
 62 large number of disabled children from the george pearkes clinic were invited 0:in 0:vited and enjoyed the commencement of 
 the festive season with the battalion providing entertainment and apc rides the men s christmas dinner saw the youngest private 
 in the battalion being served his dinner by the commanding officer wainwright again soon after christmas the battalion found itself 
 on the move once more this time to wainwright what again on exercise rapier thrust v for three weeks of 
 intensive winter tactical training the battalion was joined by b company 1 bth infantry from fort carson colorado most of 
 the american soldiers had never undergone real winter warfare training before and found it a demanding and different experience the 
 same could be said for the majority of our own private soldiers the first phases of the exercise consisted almost 
 exclusively of company 0:com 0:pany and battalion battle drills there were of course minor difficulties in adjusting to cold weather 
 tactics however these were resolved through training and practice by the time h hour rolled around the third battalion was 
 fully prepared to engage the fantasian forces pickle bags firmly fixed to weapon muzzles the co had the battalion deployed 
 in a manner which greatly increased its tactical mobility in difficult winter conditions this was accomplished by employing apcs and 
 sleds to transport the rear companies and to carry the extra equipment needed by the lead companies this was a 
 different and well appreciated change from the traditional method of backpacking rucksacks and hauling toboggans many lessons were learned on 
 exercise rapier thrust v and all concerned are much the wiser in the words of brigadier general st aubin commander 
 1 canadian brigade group exercise rapier thrust v was a complete success the third battalion returned to work point barracks 
 at the end of january and to a climate somewhat more comfortable than wainwright then with no rest for the 
 weary it was time again for unit courses this time including the 6a sergeant qualifying course the latter consisted of 
 mechanized operations mine laying internal security and operations in all phases of war the course commanded by lieutenant newman was 
 conducted in victoria and chilliwack b c regimental day regimental day 1977 was celebrated in victoria with a regimental week 
 involving four major functions the first was a band concert on 15th march by the regimental band march 16th saw

 ball spring 1977 the spring of 1977 was a busy time for the third battalion it was time to revamp 
 the battalion drills and the time and effort put into the development 0:develop 0:ment preparation and execution of these battle 
 drills paid dividends later during waincon 77 mortar platoon took advantage of the artillery practice camp in shilo and joined 
 the gunners for two weeks in april 1977 this proved an excellent opportunity for the platoon consisting of inexperienced gun 
 numbers to actually train in all phases of war with the artillery new viking lt stewart commanded a northern viking 
 platoon in the spring of 1977 the cds visited the platoon and enjoyed chatting about arctic survival 0:sur 0:vival and 
 some new equipment the platoon was doing trials on the not so exciting thoughts of waincon 77 were pushed to 
 the back of every soldier s mind when we were honoured by the visit of lady patricia brabourne in early

 sergeants toews and warrilow had been awarded the order of military merit sergeant toews received his omm for outstanding and 
 dedicated service in the canadian forces sergeant warrilow received his for actions in resolving a situation in cyprus which could

 manner and all patricia s were delighted with the recognition awarded chief warrant officer lochrie recently retired from the canadian 
 forces in the fall of 1976 his last appointment was as rsm of third battalion ppcli rsm lochrie received an

 flight was pleasantly broken up by an overnight stay in fiji but before the men could take advantage of fijis 
 s attractions they were flown to brisbane from that moment they were destined to spend nearly a whole month in 
 the bush with but one day of rest some 60 miles south of brisbane is the australian army s land

 great results one of which was credited to private ridley who broke a long standing time record in running the 
 confidence course padre white also distinguished himself by running the obstacle and confidence courses twice in order to accompany each

 coup de grace delivered by the directing staff provided the company with a new training aid i by the 9th 
 day of training the men were eager to face the jungle and were deployed on two quick exercises imitia ridge 
 and visitors vigil the former was a one day platoon patrol and ambush exercise followed immediately by a two day 
 company operation in the glassy mountain area nearly 40 miles from canungra snakes tics mites leeches jungle rats tall gum 
 trees and dense lartana created formidable obstacles for each of the platoons which operated along separate axes towards a company 
 0:com 0:pany rendez vous from here they carried out a dawn attack which eliminated the main enemy camp soon afterwards 
 exercise cease fire was called and the company was lifted by raaf helicopters back to camp where a farewell sports 
 day and b b q were held before leaving canungra there was one more duty to perform assisted by local 
 merchants each man was duly equipped with all the necessary souvenirs boomerangs koala bears kangaroo skins and opals on 19th 
 august the company left canungra and moved to ennogera barracks the home of 8 9 rar on the outskirts of 
 brisbane there the men were given the evening off permitting them to relax prior to their next phase of training 
 this stage began early the next morning when the company was taken to camp kerr at the tin can bay 
 training area where 8 9 rar was already involved in a battalion exercise within hours a company 3 ppcli was 
 fighting side by side with it s australian hosts a day later the battalion was off in an apc mounted 
 operation lasting until the 23rd when the company returned to camp kerr it was fortunate that the next exercise misty 
 point was not to start for another 2 days for the men were able to enjoy the natural beauties of 
 gimpy and the sunshine coast exercise misty point starling on august 25 was designed to practise offensive operations at battalion 
 and brigade level consequently at the section and platoon levels there was little movement except for an occasional 0:occa 0:sional 
 patrol or a large scale attack misty point climaxed in a brigade attack where d company rar a coy 3 
 ppcli proved itself as capable as it s australian counter parts exercise cease fire ushered with it a period of 
 relaxation for everyone there was no doubt that the planned leave programme would be welcomed 0:wel 0:comed indeed captains wild 
 and macdonald our air man and pr man set up a variety of leave programmes assisted by the raaf and 
 organized by the rar the men were flown to perth sydney and canberra visited the gold coast and were hosted 
 by numerous australian families to most the leave period was too short but as always the return home was viewed 
 with anticipation unfortunately during the time off pte murray was involved in a motorcycle accident forcing him to be left 
 behind in brisbane s military hospital it was with sad hearts that his comrades 0:com 0:rades left him another casualty 
 during that period was lt mclachlan who spent some time in the hospital but was fortunately released in time to 
 return home with the company august 19th was designated as a military skills sports day and a company competed with 
 8 9 rar companies the men performed well three platoon s team commanded by lt hale proved that one does 
 not have to run 3 miles a day to win a 20 km race other teams and platoons proved that 
 motivation and physical drive are the keys to victory doing well in all events the company gained the respect of 
 the australians finally on 22nd september a company was on its way home it had been a long but successful

 84 the regimental band master corporal w gow most military musicians like to consider the year september to august in 
 the following year this is due to the heavy commitments placed on military bands in the fall season the 1976 
 77 year has been a very busy but successful year for the ppcli regimental band returning from leave in september 
 our band was fortunate in acquiring 0:acquir 0:ing some new members cwo john roberti from winnipeg sgt neil gow from 
 kingston sgt david jones from winnipeg sgt andy pokolinski from norad colorado springsl the talents of these musicians have acted 
 as a catalyst in inspiring the band to one of its most successful years despite an overall reduction in numbers 
 our band has managed to maintain our traditionally high musical standard to diversify into more modern music with vocalists and 
 to fulfill as many if not more commitments than it ever has before a busy rehearsal schedule in the latter 
 part of september prepared the band for the calgary area school music appreciation program late october saw the band on 
 a northern alberta recruiting tour playing to over 5 000 spectators in grande prairie beaverlodge and slave lake another recruiting 
 tour took us to prince albert and saskatoon in november with audiences totalling over 10 000 december kept the band 
 in the calgary area playing to crippled children old folks homes the f remens annual party for needy children and 
 of course the men s christmas dinners the christmas season is particularly gratifying to service 0:ser 0:vice musicians we appreciate 
 the opportunity to assist in elevating the spirit and thought behind the christmas festivities a tour of central alberta in 
 late february saw every music student in red deer area bussed to an afternoon concert in the memorial center as 
 usual the band performed a concert that evening for the general public and the house was packed perhaps the huge 
 success could be attributed to sgt neil gow s excellent public relations efforts or the superb trumpet playing of sgt 
 davy jones that afternoon however we believe that the singing of our two recently promoted vocatlists wo peter jemus and 
 sgt laverne smith played a strong part a total of 8 000 people viewed the 10 concerts given by the 
 band in central alberta in march the 3rd battalion exercised its freedom of the city in esquimalt and provided the 
 first opportunity for the band to spruce up on parade square techniques an invitational concert in the victoria museum theatre 
 was given and much needed contributions to maintain the band s regimental full dress uniforms were gratefully received april took 
 the band on two additional recruiting tours one to edmonton athabasca and the other to the kelowna area may started 
 with the ist battalion s presentation and trooping of the color ceremony in calgary s mcmahon stadium how splendid the 
 battalion looked on the green astro turf in may the band s participation in canada day festivities in williston north 
 dakota saw the highlight of our concert season standing ovations by audiences attested to the high musical standard still maintained 
 by the regimental band letters of enthusiastic appreciation from internationally reputed musicians and educators poured into our office the following 
 week a short trip to the regina cadet tattoo concluded may s activities june opened with lgen chouinard s retirement 
 parade in wainwright following this the lord strathcona s horse trooping properly honed us for the canadian airborne regiment trooping 
 in edmonton june also saw the arrival of cpl c strom so what you say well the c stands for 
 caralynn and besides being an accomplished french horn and piano player she is a lovely and intelligent young lady and 
 indeed our first regular lady patricia no pun intended july and stampede are synonymous in calgary after participation in the 
 big parade and performing at several functions at which prince charles was in attendance the band left for ottawa for 
 the changing of the guard ceremonies on parliament hill leave begins in early august and september will once again find 
 us preparing for the upcoming year overview in addition to the duties listed above our band has performed for numerous 
 functions throughout the year three members have been lost to retirement over the past year drum major jack fisher sgt 
 harry fussell sgt claude lemieux all are well known and greatly missed for their talent as well as their comradeship 
 fortunately they are all residing in calgary and we will see them in the mess on the plus side we 
 have had a number of promotions this year and in addition to congratulating these members we would like to mention 
 that this attests to the excellent job being done by all ranks with the inspiration 0:inspira 0:tion of new talent 
 in our ranks and the enthusiasm it creates we are looking 0:look 0:ing forward to another successful year next year

 86 the combat training centre reflections on a hectic year captain ken nette i suppose this story really starts in 
 cyprus sometime during march 1976 the officer s career manager was making his annual pilgrimage to 3ppcli complete with his 
 briefcase full of decrees i knew it was coming i had beat the draft the year before because of the 
 upcoming cyprus tour but had given up looking for a reason to extend my tour with 3ppcli by another year 
 oh well i consoled myself four years in victoria was more than a lot of people get cas gagetown the 
 man said i must admit i wasn t shocked or disappointed as so many are said to be when receiving 
 similar news i had resigned myself to an obscure desk near the coffee machine at ndhq or fmchq so in 
 fact cas was good news a short discussion on which patricias were at cas who was leaving this year and 
 who would be arriving with me concluded the interview having a patricia for a career manager helps at times like 
 this i telephoned the news to my wife that night then pushed it to the back of my mind after 
 all there was still the cyprus problem to be solved and at least part of a salmon season waiting back 
 on vancouver island it was 1400 hrs 16 august 1976 when i pulled into the new brunswick town of oromocto 
 canada s model town complete with truck camper wife two children and a very confused black labrador the trip across 
 canada had been spiced with a heat wave black flies rear end troubles and two cases of mumps and chicken 
 pox not exactly a relaxing 0:relax 0:ing experience especially when daddy has never had mumps anyway we had arrived the 
 first few days were taken up with getting settled in a pmq etc etc then on 24 august resplendent in 
 my s3 i reported for duty the place was empty i found a corporal clerk in the cas orderly room 
 who advised me that the cas leave period had just started and there wouldn t be anyone around for a 
 couple weeks he had me fill out the usual inclearance 0:in 0:clearance forms then pointed me towards building h 8 
 home of the infantry department it appeared deserted but as i wandered about the main floor i detected movement above 
 on reaching the third floor i discovered a rather hefty individual walking towards me he started the conversation with good 
 morning sir you must be capt nette we ve been expecting you i m drill sergeant major murray and i 
 m ppcli he then proceeded to confirm the rumour i d heard that i would be taking over the small 
 arms platoon advised me that i had an advanced sniper course starting in seven days and assured me that if 
 i went to building d 7 i would find my staff off i went as directed i don t think 
 i uttered five words during the whole encounter i finally found building d 7 at the other end of the 
 camp and discovered it deserted this was getting to be a habit back to building h 8 for further instructions 
 mwo murray was nowhere to be found but there was a clerk in the infantry orderly room he gave me 
 a letter he had been holding for me and assured me that my platoon 21c was in fact in building 
 d 7 room 144 i took time out to read the letter before again venturing 0:ven 0:turing across camp it 
 was from col cowling my old co from 3ppcli and recently departed co of the infantry department in it he 
 advised me that i would be commanding the small arms platoon an organization who s existence i was starting to 
 doubt and in my spare time would be running the continuation parachuting programme well that sounds like fun i thought 
 but the immediate problem was to find my new command i wondered if montgomery had had this much trouble finding 
 the eighth army on my second trip to d 7 i finally hit pay dirt the door to room 144 
 was open i still swear it was locked the first time i was there i strolled inside 0:in 0:side and 
 there waiting for me like a couple of vultures were wo ritthaler and mwo squeaky reid my first impulse was 
 to run as i would probably 0:pro 0:bably only get myself into trouble cavorting with a couple of bandits like 
 these two i d served in the ppcli depot with mwo reid in 1964 and had known wo ritthaler off 
 and on for six years with second battalion he d been with me on the trail of 98 in 1965 
 see volume xviii 1965 of the patricia on second thought my memories of these two were not that terrible so 
 i decided to stick around for a little while the first thing i noticed was that these guys weren t 
 corporals any more they were both warrant officers oh well i thought i m not a second lieutenant any more 
 either the next half hour was filled with reminiscing about the good old days and bringing the new oc small 
 arms i was starting to believe that the position actually existed up to date on who s who in cas 
 wo ritthaler had arrived a year earlier and was just getting over his bitterness over a rather shakey reception he 
 had just become 21c small arms and would be working with me for the forseeable future mwo reid was 21c 
 of the armour defence platoon and one of the few tow experts in the canadian 0:cana 0:dian army bill miller 
 and ed hale were both here in pioneer platoon and bill gray and scotty hamilton were teaching officer cadets in 
 leadership wing they were all warrant officers as well amazing how time flies i thought most of them were corporals 
 when i knew them all this talking had made me thirsty and as it was approaching 10 o clock i 
 decided to try and find the officers mess and coffee break i found the headquarters and cas mess without any 
 trouble but you guessed it it was closed i noticed people heading towards the 2rcr mess next door so over 
 i went for a camp that seemed deserted there were a lot of people at coffee break i started bumping 
 into old friends right away first there was bgen emk macgregor commander ctc he had been my first co and 
 was a man i have always admired then lcol hunt the base adm officer walked in he had been oc 
 c company in 2ppcli when i was ami tank platoon commander finally my new boss lcol stewart arrived working for 
 him was getting to be routine he had been senior subaltern when i first joined the regiment in 1963 then 
 was 21c of a coy when i was 3pi comd a year later from july 68 to august 69 i 
 was his coy 21c in germany now i was going to work for him again he had just arrived from 
 cyprus where he relinquished command of 2ppcli and would be the new co of the infantry department he hadn t 
 actually checked in yet and appeared more bewildered than i was after coffee i went looking for my office the 
 one i had found before was ritthaler s it turned out to be in building d 10 instead of d 
 7 and was locked it took me a while to organize a key but once in i got right to 
 work it turned out that there wasn t any work to do at least not right away my predecessor capt 
 jim trick has left a well organized shop behind him and everything was set to go for the upcoming sniper 
 course this gave me a chance to look around the camp and get myself oriented i found capt dave rudd 
 working away in officers wing running a loft course land familiarization for helicopter pilots i had met dave a couple 
 of years earlier when he was passing through victoria on his way to the jungle warfare course in australia he 
 almost made it there and of course i had run into his father several times over the years he had 
 been baby sitting the parachuting programme for me so we had a lot to discuss it seemed that the regiment 
 was well represented there as well the senior jumpmaster was wo johnston and mwo reid was the senior drop zone 
 controller that guy seemed to be turning up everywhere 
 87 the next old friend i encountered in my travels was major english major jack and i had served together 
 in third battalion he was now a gagetown veteran going into his third season his current job was probably 0:prob 
 0:ably the most difficult one on base trying to keep over 400 vehicles on the road with less than 180 
 drivers somehow he also found time to coordinate 0:coor 0:dinate regimental affairs it was about this time that i ran 
 into capt mary dyck our association went back to germany in 1966 and i d been running into him off 
 and on since he had just finished a tour with rss in winnipeg had arrived in gagetown a month before 
 me and was working in the cas standards section i didn t know it at the time but we would 
 be working very closely together in the months to come the sniper course got off on schedule in addition to 
 wo ritthaler i had sgt blair singer and a bunch of people from those other regiments helping me during those 
 first few weeks i learned as much as the students did and somehow managed to stay one day ahead of 
 them it was during these hectic first few days that reinforcements started arriving from the army of the west the 
 first to arrive was mcpl bill turner i ran into him and his family in the parking lot of the 
 oromocto shopping centre they still had their camper trailer hooked to the car and had a worn out look about 
 them after all it is 4000 miles from victoria to gagetown they seemed relieved to see a familiar face and 
 i helped them out by directing them to the townsite office shortly afterwards wo gill hopkins truck camper pulled into 
 camp followed by wo john dickies volvo they both took up positions in leadership wing grooming future officers although it 
 was a couple of months before i ran into him gagetown is a big place sgt reg gurr also arrived 
 about this time and went to help major english look after his 400 vehicles it wasn t long before the 
 leave period ended and people began coming back to work it was a time to renew old acquantances and to 
 establish new one first there was capt mike mcmurtrie mike had been adjutant and oc support company during my recent 
 tour with 3 ppcli he had left victoria the year before me and was now working 18 hours a day 
 as so2 standards a thankless job if ever i saw one he had plenty of help from the regiment however 
 in addition to mary dyck he had capt dave giacomelli a recent arrival from calgary and mwo hryhoryshen in the 
 section next there was capt paul ronksley we had been roommates in ocp but our paths hadn t crossed since 
 he was into his second year at cas and was working in officers wing planning company commander s courses and 
 the like those days were full of surprises like running into cpl ed cody he had been ac2 gunner in 
 2 platoon when i was 21c of a company 2 ppcli in germany now he was driving oc advanced specialty 
 wing around and generally making himself useful around wing hq it was also a time to meet patricia s i 
 hadn t met before capt dan davies the base adjutant wos ed bakker dave yendall and la johnston of leadership 
 wing sgt luke carmichael of leadership wing and wos bob clark and paddy mceachern of the armoured defence platoon 0:pla 
 0:toon like everyone else at cas they were all busy getting the fall course schedule going one of the busiest 
 people was capt hap stutt he had just finished a years penance on the fmc writing team the price one 
 pays for a two year swan in england and was now launching his first phase 2 officer s course i 
 had worked for his father major bill stutt though when he was co of the depot it s situations like 
 this that make one start to feel old although not officially a patricia our australian exchange officer capt bill studley 
 had been adopted by the gagetown patricia s and was con sidered one of us i found him to be 
 a true professional and developed a high regard for both he and his wife kate unfortunately they returned to australia 
 three months later so i didn t really get to know them well about half way through the sniper course 
 we had our first regimental get together bgen macgregor was retiring and of course would be leaving gagetown as many 
 as could got together for one last drink with him and we gave him a pewter salver to remember us 
 by lcol art neadow himself a recent gagetown veteran also put in an appearance he had just completed a year 
 in the middle east and was in the process of picking up his family en route to his new posting 
 in western canada this and the other such occasions during the past year have given me a chance to meet 
 the patricia s working in places other than infantry department on the old friend list there was sgt gd granger 
 a communications 0:com 0:munications instructor in the armoured department we d served in third battalion together also from third battalion 
 were sgt danny gaudett mcpl jc welsh and cpls be arsenault and et cruickshanks they were all working for major 
 english in the field mobility group at one time or another in the past i had worked closely with all 
 of them and it was good to see them again the artillery department also had its token patricia in the 
 form of sgt steve kozlik i hadn t met him before but regardless it was good to see that we 
 had some input into the mortar training given our soldiers by the artillery why we don t train them ourselves 
 i still haven t figured out the advanced sniper course finished and with only five days to catch our breath 
 we were off on the fall combat small arms course the sniper course had been a success not bad for 
 a first effort i had thought at the time and the top student had been a patricia an old friend 
 from third battalion by the name of sgt luscombe half way through wo ed hale had joined my team of 
 instructors his years of experience with regimental small arms teams made him a valuable addition on the first morning of 
 the small arms course i was amazed to see the number of old comrades attending it some had been in 
 cyprus with me five months before while others i hadn t seen in years i made a point of inviting 
 them all to the patricia meet and greet party the following weekend this was a gala affair held in the 
 brownfield sergeants mess many people worked to make it possible but mwo jack murray was the driving force behind the 
 whole thing a good percentage of our patricia staff members were there as well as a number of students by 
 this time i had met most of the gagetown patricia s so it was a time for socializing rather then 
 meeting people i did run into one old friend capt john desolla i d first met john in 1963 at 
 the rcs of i and had bumped into him periodically over the years he was the area cadet officer land 
 of course for new brunswick and as he was on the road a lot he predicted i wouldn t see 
 much of him he was right october turned to november and along with the first cold weather came the graduation 
 under platoon commander capt bill studley of the phase 3 octp class as it turned out it became a predominately 
 patricia affair nine of the graduating officers would be coming to the regiment among them the top three candidates led 
 by lt pete hoffman winner of the canadian infantry association trophy the reviewing officer for the graduation parade was mgen 
 gg brown deputy commander mobile command and senior serving patricia we put together a regimental team to take care of 
 him with cpl cody as his batman cpl arsenault as his driver and myself as adc the whole affair came 
 off very well concluding 0:con 0:cluding with an informal ppcli get together just before the general left major bill minnis 
 the ppcli liaison officer at fort benning georgia he also represents the rest of the cf who was also in 
 gagetown at the time dropped in to say hello and renew a few old friendships gen brown had a great 
 time talking with the troops and i m sure that if it hadn t been for an air canada schedule 
 he would have spent the whole evening with us 
 88 november also saw the arrival at cas of two other old friends capt ron johnson arrived from 2 ppcli 
 to take over armoured defence platoon 0:pla 0:toon and become the canadian army s resident expert on tow i had 
 first served with ron from 1965 to 1969 in 2ppcli more recently he had been following me around the world 
 he replaced me in unef hq in egypt in 1974 and 18 months later replaced me in cyprus now he 
 was following me to gagetown the second new addition was capt vince kennedy vince had been a platoon commander in 
 a company 3 ppcli when i first arrived there in 1972 six months later he left to serve his country 
 overseas and was now returning after four years service with 3 mech cdo to pass on his knowledge to a 
 new generation of young officers the small arms course finished on 16 december and again i had managed to stay 
 one day ahead of the students we all learned a lot two significant events occurred that month the first and 
 happiest was the promotion to mwo of bill miller and tom reid the second was the disbandment of mike mcmurtrie 
 s standards section the first of many changes to rock the establishment in the months to come some say that 
 mike cried for days following the announcement but i don t believe it i saw him the next day and 
 mad yes but weeping no this move was the infantry department s gain however mike bundled up all of his 
 infantry standards crew and moved over to the department all but mwo hryhoryshen that is who moved to cas hq 
 to get a grip on the range control operations probably the last official activity of 1976 other than christmas was 
 a parachute jump from a cl3o on 19 december it involved one of those freak winds at 500 feet which 
 don t show up on the navigator s instruments 0:in 0:struments as a result i landed several hundred yards from 
 the dz on the edge of a road others weren t quite so lucky mary dyck bill miller and ed 
 bakker all landed in the trees fortunately no one was seriously hurt but it took three hours to recover their 
 parachutes bill miller s chainsaws from his pioneer stores came in very handy as we had to cut down 35 
 trees before we were finished i shouldn t have laughed so hard though because six weeks later i was in 
 the same situation an updraft caught me and being a little guy up i went when i finally came down 
 i was off the dz and into the trees one minute i was heading into a soft spruce tree landing 
 not overly concerned about the whole thing the next i was hanging onto the peak of a very dead tree 
 towering above all the rest with my partially inflated chute flapping in the breeze and attempting to break the top 
 off the tree if that happened it wouldn t only be the tree that got broken i felt like king 
 kong clinging to the top of the empire state building i got rid of my chute that stopped the creaking 
 in the tree did a quick check for broken bones and then started down it was a hairy trip down 
 as the tree had virtually no branches and as i write this several months later i still have the marks 
 left by that tree on the inside of my right leg the regiment got back at the tree though ed 
 bakker cut it down while recovering my chute i m sure he was laughing the whole time the parachuting programme 
 had been going very well two things happened shortly after i took over the programme which changed it s character 
 considerably first the restriction on jumping from huey helicopters was lifted with two helicopter squadrons on base our aircraft problems 
 were over secondly cas lost the 40 permanent parachute positions and we all went on casual parachute allowance initially this 
 looked like disaster in the long run it has worked out all right prior to this change the training and 
 safety officer me maintained a 40 man active list and a waiting list everyone on the active list received para 
 allowance every four months anybody who had been on the active list for more than a year ceased jumping and 
 was replaced by someone on the waiting list my past records however showed that getting some of the people on 
 the active list out to jump was akin to pulling teeth when the change came it was amazing the number 
 of people who were no longer interested in parachuting once the 75 dollars per month was gone this isn t 
 surprising when one considers that the programme was virtually being run by the regiment with lcol stewart as senior parachutist 
 wo la johnston as senior jumpmaster and wo scotty hamilton as senior drop zone controller he d replaced tom reid 
 in october and of course there was me any patricia with an airborne flair and i find that most have 
 now has a good chance of going directly onto the active list on posting to gagetown the money isn t 
 what it used to be but you don t have to worry about being bounced off the list after a 
 year anymore january is traditionally the make and mend month at cas and 1977 was no exception in the small 
 arms platoon we worked away at getting ready for the winter combat small arms course and the spring advanced machine 
 gun course my organization changed slightly with sgt blair singer moving to leadership wing and wo scotty hamilton taking his 
 place he had been earmarked to replace our exchange wo with the british army and he needed some experience as 
 a small arms instructor it was about this time also that mwo miller left his beloved pioneer platoon 0:pla 0:toon 
 to become wing sergeant major of officers wing there were changes in the officer slate as well with capt dave 
 rudd leaving infantry department to become so3 coord in the head shed by this time we were well into the 
 maritime winter being from the prairies i was used to lots of snow and after four years in victoria i 
 was no stranger to winter rains but not both at the same time the resulting mess is something to behold 
 if you leave something out on your driveway during 0:dur 0:ing a blizzard anywhere else in canada you just dig 
 it out with a snow shovel the next morning in the maritimes you need a hammer and chisel either that 
 or wait for spring all kidding aside however gagetown ha j a lot to offer during the winter both my 
 wife and i took up cross country skiing and we had several family outings ranging from tobbogganing down mount douglas 
 to catching smelts through the ice on the st john river january was also the month we all put up 
 our red and white ppcli flashes and made a point of wearing our work dress as often as possible the 
 heavy demand led to the establishment of major jack s kit shop which was to expand its inventory considerably over 
 the next few months january also saw the departure of the studleys and their replacement 0:replace 0:ment by the mcdaniels 
 we quickly took dan under our wing and both he and his wife dale became part of the family february 
 came and went with the small arms course going full out and the advanced machine gun course getting closer this 
 was to be the first such course in several years and it had to be redeveloped from scratch mary dyck 
 was writing the course package and to make it easier on all of us he moved into my office many 
 an hour was spent discussing pos eos and main teaching points on 22nd february we all got together to say 
 farewell to wos bob shewan and ed hale who had come to the end of their soldiering careers lcol stewart 
 presented them both with their regimental retirement certificates 0:cer 0:tificates as well as pewter salvers from the gagetown crew other 
 matters of noteduring february were la johnson s one hundredth parachute jump and dave yendall s promotion to mwo march 
 arrived and of course with it the regimental day we began our preparations early with major jack at the point 
 assisted by mwo jack murray and capts vince kennedy dave giacomelli and dave rudd to start it off in keeping 
 with a tradition set last year we all assembled at the red cross blood donors clinic for regimental blood letting 
 it didn t quite come off as planned but wo ed bakker had his picture taken dripping with the co 
 on the 17th we couldn t get going with our broom i 100 game until 3 o clock in the 
 afternoon as this was the earliest we could get the ice when rittahaler phoned at 11 a m to advise 
 me that he was leaving work to start celebrating at ed bakker s home i figured we had it made 
 ritthaler was goalie for both the sergeant s mess and infantry 
 89 department broomball teams and it was certain that he would be in the nets for the other ranks that 
 afternoon with a little luck he should be in fine shape by 3 o clock i thought sort of like 
 the way napoleon thought he had it made before waterloo at the appointed time i reported to the king s 
 arrow arena dressed in my battledress tunic and vp belt it s amazing how old uniforms will shrink just hanging 
 in a closet all set to do battle one by one the opposing players arrived on the scene and after 
 a short delay while the referee major allen bower our british exchange officer learned to use the skates he was 
 wearing we got right at it the opening ceremonies were brief with the ors team giving us a quick look 
 then we were off our initial strategy was to put the biggest mass we had in the form of hap 
 stutt in our goal we quickly found however that it takes more than mass to stop the first line from 
 the sergeant s mess broomball team and that was what we were up against when the score got to 5 
 0 the co decided we needed a new goalie resplendent in his blue patrols he took the post himself two 
 goals later it was dave rudd s turn it was a hard fought game with many antics but nothing malicious 
 several times i got close to ritthaler and each time one of his fairy godfathers 0:god 0:fathers would appear from 
 nowhere and take the ball away from me the final score of 7 0 for the ors secured the spent 
 trophy for the officers for another year following the game we adjourned to the pig and whistle our normal meeting 
 place for picture taking clam chowder and a special birthday cake that evening the officers gathered in the blue room 
 of the officer s 0:of 0:ficer 0:s mess for a mess dinner arranged by dave rudd it was an excellent 
 affair with just the immediate family present our wives were a little in fact a lot upset over not being 
 invited so they all got together at my house for a party of their own all in all it was 
 a very successful march 17th march of course was also the month we joined patricia s around the world in 
 putting up ppcli flashes and buttons on our greens it made us feel just that much prouder on friday morning 
 parades the big event during april was the officers kapyong dinner at the dragon city restaurant in fredericton almost all 
 of the officers and their wives attended as well as most of the patricias attending the company commanders course the 
 affair was organized by lt bob gallant bob had graduated with the phase three class in november and had stayed 
 on as part of the staff of leadership wing running pre para and winter warfare 0:war 0:fare training for between 
 phase cadets by this time the snow had gone and the mud had arrived somewhere along the way the small 
 arms course had turned into the advanced machine gun course again there were old friends to train including five from 
 victoria i still tend to identify with third battalion as may arrived the weather improved somewhat and the training area 
 started to dry out we tried to organize an officers luncheon for frezenberg day but everyone was so busy it 
 just wasn t practical major jack and a couple of others were available so they celebrated for the rest of 
 us we were able to get a quorum together though to say farewell to wos ccc bonner and john dickie 
 both had served a year in gagetown ccc running the vtr section and john working with officer cadets and had 
 come to the end of their soldiering careers ccc planned to settle down in the maritimes for a while at 
 least and john was headed back to victoria they both departed with their regimental retirement certificates and pewter salvers clutched 
 firmly in their hands every may a curious phenomena occurs in gagetown strange instructors 0:in 0:structors appear even stranger young 
 gentlemen arrive normal organizations 0:organiza 0:tions dissolve and the whole place turns into an officer factory the first to arrive 
 are the increment staff this year all three battalions coughed up and capt ralph schutt wos arndt and scott and 
 sergeants harb helchy and bouchard joined the team they barely had time to get themselves organized when their first group 
 of charges arrived the summer officer training program even swallows up the small arms platoon the advanced machine gun course 
 was hardly over when my merry band reported en mass to major allen bower at officers wing we were responsible 
 for running the first four weeks of the phase four officers course this is primarily a range conducting course so 
 it was right up my alley in early july the course changed to a tactics course so ritthaler and the 
 rest of my staff went off to teach militia marksmanship coaches and militia sergeants major i stayed on as a 
 syndicate ds along with capts mary dyck and ron johnson capt paul ronksly the power behind the throne in officers 
 wing had put the course together and was now making it work pte bowden the oc s driver formed the 
 rest of the ppcli contribution to the 1977 phase four staff this course finishes on 12 august then on 31 
 august the fall sniper course starts and we re back to where this article started gagetown is a big camp 
 and it s hard to remember everything that goes on in the course of a year and all of those 
 who make it possible to those of you i haven t mentioned so far i apologize no charlie meaning cpl 
 naugler i haven t forgotten about you up at field mobility group nor have i forgotten sgt bob fife in

 97 princess patricia s canadian light infantry association patron the lady patricia brabourne cd jp dl vice patrons major general 
 cb ware dso cd brigadier general ja de lalanne cbe mc ed president s report it has been my honour 
 and priviledge to have served as your president since august of 1974 a total period of two years and nine 
 months in september i visited victoria and calgary and inspected the ppcli cadet corps there on your behalf i awarded 
 association trophy to the calgary cadet corps your general committee met yesterday and the results of that meeting will be 
 presented to you in a few minutes in the form of definite proposals i would like to highlight a few 
 of the main points it is time now for us to review the terms of reference for the hamilton gault 
 memorial fund and to reconsider the composition of the board of trustees with the unfortunate passing of lcol cobbett there 
 is a requirement 0:re 0:quirement to appoint a new financial advisor and trustee in my capacity as president i have 
 appointed don gower to fill this vacancy in addition major campbell has pointed out that his position as secretary treasurer 
 and his appointment as a trustee could create a conflict of interest i support 0:sup 0:port his recommendation that these 
 two positions be separated and that another trustee be appointed in his place some years ago we approved a provision 
 which gave financial support 0:sup 0:port to the ppcli cadet corps over the years this support has risen from less 
 than 500 00 to in excess of 1200 00 and now consumes the bulk of the income received from the 
 hamilton gault memorial fund this increase 0:in 0:crease is typical of the general rise in expenses experienced by all organizations 
 and individuals and we are now faced with the choice of either limiting the financial support provided by our fund 
 or of increasing the invested capital this and the ready availability of other grants for education purposes has raised some 
 concern that the fund is not fulfilling it s aim and i have directed the ways and means committee to 
 review the whole concept of the fund and to report to your executive we have also had some difficulty in 
 collecting branch dues and the dues from members at large i will be corresponding directly with the appropriate 0:ap 0:propriate 
 branch presidents concerning this affair and we will table the entire concept of members at large later on in this 
 meeting i am pleased to report that the new patrician has met with much more success than the previous version 
 one more branch has resumed taking the annual journal and i would encourage the remaining branches to reconsider their positions 
 equally important is our contribution to the journal to those of you who complain that it contains little of interest 
 to the ex serving member i would state that the journal is as good as it s contents if we 
 wish to have a place in the patrician then we must contribute 0:con 0:tribute to it by submitting our branch 
 reports reminiscences and so on if it doesn t apply to us surely that is because we are not providing 
 the material at the last meeting you were introduced to the recommendation of the ways and means committee and after 
 some discussion these proposals 0:pro 0:posals were tabled for discussion at this meeting i regret to state that only the 
 vancouver branch has seen fit to comment on these proposals and the explanatory letters which followed them the ways and 
 means committee 0:com 0:mittee met again in ottawa last december and has again reiterated the requirement 0:re 0:quirement for support 
 from our association i wish to make it absolutely clear that the regular force portion of our association are not 
 requesting financial support on their own behalf what we are being requested to do is to pay our own way 
 by sharing of certain expenditures from which we the association derive direct benefit i urge you to view the proposals 
 from this point of view and to resolve the issue at this meeting this then is a summary of most 
 of the business before us and the details will be provided as we proceed through the agenda there are two 
 other points however worthy of special mention first is the motion to appoint dr c e corrigan as an honourary 
 life member doc corrigan s contributions really need no publicity he has been one of the most generous contributors to 
 the hamilton gault memorial fund since its inception 0:in 0:ception he has been active with the winnipeg branch for many 
 years and is a true patricia finally this weekend marks the end of an era and the beginning of a 
 new one the presentation of the new colours to 1 ppcli marks the last official act of general ware as 
 our colonel of the regiment but not i am sure his involvement with it i know there is no one 
 in this room who is not fully aware of the contributions made and support given to the regiment for almost 
 47 years by this distinguished soldier words alone are insufficient to thank him for his constant efforts on our behalf 
 and i therefore move that general ware be appointed a vice patron of our association as a signal of our 
 respect appreciation and thanks i would like to record an official welcome to the new colonel of the regiment major 
 general brown and to wish him as much success as his predecessor in closing let us remember that we are 
 missing one of our most respected members and a vice patron of our association pinky corvosso passed away in victoria 
 last month and we are all the poorer for losing him the president s motion on the appointment of major 
 general cb ware as vice patron and dr ce corrigan as an honourary life member were seconded by colonel jc 
 allan and passed unanimously note the above report was submitted by mr ej dodd the retiring president at the annual 
 general meeting held at currie barracks 7 may 1977 
 98 calgary branch 1977 looking back over the events of 1977 the calgary branch had a truly busy year at 
 the first meeting in january president jim shinn decided it was time for some new blood on the executive committee 
 and observing 0:observ 0:ing good democratic practice the following were elected president jim pritchard vice president ken villiger secretary treasurer 
 kas zoboski members congratulated and thanked jim shinn for a job well done over may years at a subsequent meeting 
 the following committee appointments 0:appoint 0:ments were made membership george delroy ways and means jack nairne entertainment andy kraley the 
 first order of business was a drive for new members and we are now happy to report that our membership 
 stands at 122 and is still growing well done george on may bth 1977 many of us witnessed what had 
 to be one of the most magnificent presentation and trooping the colour ceremonies ever performed everything about the day was 
 perfect and when the old guard formed up it was difficult to tell whether the troops on parade or the 
 old guard were the proudest a truly memorable day on october 2nd 1977 the calgary branch presented a badge replica 
 and plaque to no 1 branch royal canadian legion this was to commemorate 0:com 0:memorate their 50th anniversary and a 
 long association between the regiment and no 1 branch this two foot high replica is displayed in a shadow box 
 and stands in a place of honour among other corps and regimental badges this short presentation ceremony was followed by 
 a reception attended by about 75 of our owm members and their wives and an equal number of legionaires the 
 final big event of the year was a regimental associations dance this was a combined operations affair with the lord 
 strathcona horse royal canadian regimental association this gala night started out in a casual conversation between fred jefferson the ld 
 sh rc president and jim pritchard after a lot of hard work by both committees it turned out to be 
 a night when the food was fantastic the band just right and the company excellent some of our older members 
 cut a pretty mean figure on the dance floor the affair was so successful we plan to have one like 
 it every year the calgary branch is looking forward to a bigger and better year in 1978 and would be 
 happy to hear from any visiting ou t of town patricias we can be contacted through regimental headquarters at cfb 
 calgary vancouver branch 1976 the annual general meeting of the vancouver branch was held at the warrant officers and sergeants 
 mess at jericho beach on sunday february 15th 1976 m mcl parsons was elected president and major c pyne was 
 elected vice president our annual dinner was held on march 17th at the warrant officers and sergeants mess at jericho 
 beach there were 50 members present colonel l w basham was guest of honour in his address to the membership 
 he gave a very interesting talk on regimental activities and showed the trooping of the colour film done in edmonton 
 in 1964 a most enjoyable evening for all concerned on october 16th the branch held a wine and cheese party 
 at the jericho beach officers mess we were honoured once again with the presence of colonel and mrs basham also 
 in attendance were our good out of town supporters from chilliwack helen and harold grouette and hope and harry chatry 
 peter maclennan was in town on a visit from scotland and it was a pleasure to have him with us 
 as well the vancouver branch held four executive meetings in 1976 as well as the two social functions mentioned earlier 
 a great deal of effort was put forth to create interest and enthusiasm within the branch allan mckinnon will be 
 our guest of honour at our march 17th dinner and we look forward to another good year in 1977 toronto 
 branch 1976 77 our only official meeting last year 1976 was the annual dinner and although small in number it 
 was very enjoyable to all we had as our guests peter o hanlon of bramalea ontario a professional amateur theatrical 
 singer and major dave campbell from calgary regimental hq peter gave a very interesting talk on military music and songs 
 down through the ages and how the conditions at the time had influenced the lyrics and melody he illustrated each 
 example by rendering a few bars of the songs in his marvelous baritone but these were only teasers and it 
 was not until after dinner and we had all settled down for a sing song that he really gave forth 
 and we ran through from roses of picardy to sweetbrair was never like this just like the old days dave 
 campbell brought us up to date on the regiment to day and the re organization taking place in calgary it 
 was really heartwarming 0:heart 0:warming to hear after worried questioning from red fulton that the history of the regiment and 
 respect for the traditions established through the years are still part of the indoctrination of the new recruit on joining 
 the regiment during our annual dinner dave pearce 2265553 paid tribute to the annual observation of the battle of frezenberg 
 stating that those men by their sacrifices in that battle gave birth to one of our greatest traditions steadfastness in 
 battle under the most trying conditions dave stated that those gallant men should never be forgotten and went on to 
 recite this piece of original verse in memory of frezenberg to the bravest of the brave citizen soldiers as long 
 as faith and freedom lasts and the world goes round the sun this stands the canadian line held fast and 
 so the fight was won the greatest fight that ever yet brought all the world to derth a fight of 
 two great nations set to battle for the earth and one there was with blood aflame to make the earth 
 his tool and one there was in freedom s name that mercy still would rule it was a living line 
 of canada s gallant youth that fought the prussian one to nine to save the world for truth that bleeding 
 line that fallen fence that stubborn ebbing wave that string of suffering human sense shuddered but never gave 
 99 and day came in and night wore on and when the moon was gone murder burst out with fiercer 
 din and still the fight raged on dave is our travelling ambassador for the toronto branch and i never know 
 from where i am going to receive the next letter dave spends his winters in florida and returns to toronto 
 for may bth and the summer a couple of years ago he returned to his birthplace rickinghall suffold england to 
 run down a little bit of regimental history it seems that dur ah never yet did men more true or 
 souls more finely wrought from cressy down to waterloo fight as those young men fought and this is their abiding 
 praise no future can undo ing 1890 and 1894 five boys were born in the village brothers henry and john 
 whistlecraft wallace warren harry smith and david pearce they grew up together but in 1907 went their separate ways their 
 paths cross again later on they all came to canada and they all joined the ppcli the whistlecraft brothers and 
 wallace warren were killed in action in france but dave doesn t know where and he would like to find 
 out harry smith not once in all those staggering days that avalanche broke through died in ontario about three years 
 ago dave is the last surviving member of the 5 musketeers of rickinghall as dave calls them dave pearce 2265553 
 please convey greetings and sincere best wishes from toronto to patricias everywhere and in particular to those still serving in 
 me mori am at the going down of the sun and in the morning we will remember them 487359 allen

 101 the royal green jackets the first battalion letter during holy week the battalion flew to cyprus to start a 
 six months unaccompanied tour in effect we were to become two battalions 0:bat 0:talions one of which joined the united 
 nations force and the other of which garrisoned the eastern sovereign base area at dhekelia the two battalions were completely 
 and officially independent of each other contact between the two acting as they were as an international 0:inter 0:national and 
 national contingent respectively was not permitted although needless to say by frequent sleight of hand and changing of berets we 
 maintained close links with each other the commanding officer edward jones led b and c companies 0:com 0:panies off to 
 the west of nicosia with half of battalion headquarters and a small headquarters company to operate under the blue flag 
 of the united nations since the 1974 war the greek and turkish cypriot communities have polarized and are now almost 
 completely separate only some 4 000 greeks remain in the north mainly in the isolated karpas district and these trickle 
 south in response to turkish pressure at the rate of two or three hundred a month in the south are 
 only a few dozen turks as a result the united nations force was redeployed in october 1975 along the line 
 of the demilitarized zone this zone is divided into six sectors the battalion was responsible for sector two a corridor 
 some twenty five kilometres long ranging from one and a half to three and a half kilometres in width to 
 the west was the danish contingent and to the east the finns who guarded nicosia airport the canadians who were 
 responsible for nicosia itself the austrians and the swedes in the eastern half of the battalion s area c company 
 was based in st david s camp with battalion headquarters and deployed most of its soldiers in comfortable modern houses 
 which had been annexed as observation posts despite an unpromising start to life as camp x prison camp in e 
 o k a days st david s camp had been much improved and provided very adequate accommodation to the west 
 b company were based in a box factory at pano zodhia a hangar like building of uncompromising discomfort the company 
 manned four outposts which were until the last days of the tour under canvas a small troop of royal engineers 
 from 22 regiment r e were attached to the battalion and worked closely with b company building their o p 
 huts and coaxing an accident prone grader out of its shed to keep the patrol tracks passable another group which 
 worked closely with the battalion was the small contingent of australian civil police commanded by chief superintendent fred luther in 
 the most trying situations they were good humoured and tireless in their support and proved most enjoyable 0:enjoy 0:able companions 
 the two companies controlled very different types of ground and this affected their tasks b company s area was mostly 
 the rich citrus groves of the morphou plain and cpl brennan ran a full time escort agency which provided riflemen 
 as escorts for the local greek farmers and prevented them from straying too far north in the demilitarized 0:de 0:militarized 
 zone towards the turks c company had more open ground which was visible from the turkish positions here farmers were 
 also escorted but their movement could be controlled more easily by fewer escorts observation posts were manned by half platoons 
 although leave often whittled them down to section strength each was commanded by either the platoon commander or the platoon 
 sergeant and the former learned much about basic administration 0:adminis 0:tration one of the most obvious benefits of the tour 
 was the great improvement in the riflemen s confidence when briefing visiting officers or talking on the radio at the 
 extreme western edge of c company s area was the village of avlona formerly a wealthy greek farming community it 
 had recently been colonized by the turks all the most significant confrontations 0:con 0:frontations took place here it was the 
 only place where the turks opened fire and even when it simmered uneasily it influenced actions throughout the battalion area 
 and often in the other national sectors as well although the summer was cooler and shorter than usual fires were 
 a constant hazard in the demilitarized zones mainly in those areas where vegetation happened to limit turkish fields of fire 
 most agents spying out the turkish lines as was alleged it was hard to tell threatened they were helped by 
 greek fire engines which would trundle through the zone but whether manned by firefighters or by agents spying out the 
 turkish lines as was alleged it was hard to tell an unusual feature of cyprus soldiering was the addiction to 
 conferences 0:con 0:ferences usually a brief discussion which was the prelude to a gargantuan meal a visit to a point 
 of local interest and vast amounts of alcohol these happened every month and at every level commanding 0:com 0:manding officers 
 operations officers quartermasters signals officers the same agenda as for the signals warrant officers the previous week down to welfare 
 and travel officers swedes and danes in particular confused us by sending three or four officers to any 
 102 conference despite this tendency to over egg the pudding the social life was quite agreeable it was a pleasant 
 surprise to find that the canadian battalion in nicosia was the 2nd princess patricia s canadian light infantry in any 
 confrontation with the turks the usual response was to deploy 0:de 0:ploy a small multinational force to avoid allegations of 
 national prejudice it was always reassuring to find a strong canadian p p c l i element in this force 
 who could be relied upon to act and think as we would ourselves off duty we had several pleasant evenings 
 together despite the pressure generated by avlona while the riflemen found a generous welcome at the maple leaf complex the 
 officers were welcomed into the splendid mess next to the canadian headquarters 0:head 0:quarters in the ledra palace hotel where 
 our affiliation strengthened considerably so the tour passed leaving a kaleidoscope of memories unfruitful meetings with obstructive turks or with 
 angry bewildered greek farmers weeks spent on the dusty plain the weekends in troodos or on the coast endless guards 
 of honour worn out vehicles overhauled with a coat of white paint luncheon in kyrenia depressingly empty of tourists the 
 bright canopies of the harbour club like rouge on old cheeks fragmentary pictures of some loose entente with austrians finns 
 swedes ct al an insight into bureaucratic soldiering and the stifling hegemony of new york all it is said in 
 the service of peace in mid august the band and bugles who had been left in england for the season 
 as the only light division band in the kingdom came out to join us and we made full use of 
 them one evening at the end of september as a finale to our tour they sounded retreat at dusk on 
 the floodlit square with the usual ceremony amplified slightly by the participation in a symbolic manner of some of the 
 riflemen whose duty it had been to maintain the security of the sovereign base area during the preceding six months 
 afterwards the officers and sergeants entertained their guests to a buffet supper or barbecue in their respective messes on 13th 
 october we all began to be relieved in the united nations and at dhekelia by the ist battalion the parachute 
 regiment and flew home to england for a fortnight s leave for both halves of the battalion it had been 
 an instructive if totally different tour perhaps the most interesting lesson learned by both was that for a period of 
 up to six months it is perfectly possible to run effectively what amounts to a whole battalion with only half 
 the normal staff albeit with no slack to spare at all one just hopes that our political masters will not 
 seize on this as an excuse for a permanent fifty per cent cut in the command and administrative elements of 
 an infantry battalion editor s note unfortunately space available did not permit the printing of activities concerning the 2nd 3rd 
 and 4th battalions it was felt that due to our first battalion proceeding to cyprus early in 1977 that the 
 foregoing article would provide some insight into conditions in cyprus at this time our thanks are extended to the first
