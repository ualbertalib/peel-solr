 and machined in a hurry at this time there was a press party sprinkled talcum powder in their bed at
 the north end of the trail waiting to it turned out however that this powder return to edmonton they were

 the trail with the boys who were driving a team of indian ponies and a evergreens on a carpet of
 purple fireweed buckboard the machinery and our cowhide suitcase were tied to the buckboard the sandy ground hid old stumps
 so and we took the victoria trail to fort that the wheels bumped over them on saskatchewan turning north on
 the one one side and sunk to the hubs in deep to athabasca sand on the other we saw no
 bears about noon we reached the sturgeon only their tracks but when hitting the river where there was a bridge
 which stumps we nearly bounded up into the had to be crossed carefully and beyond trees with the squirrels the
 ground in it was a stopping place called snow s some places was covered with bluewhere we had dinner tom

 mention it the captain being an excitable man hopped out of bed threw his mattress we visited the nuns and
 their broken and hat overboard to the accompanylegged young patient and had tea and ment of all the sailor language
 he had our picture taken bishop grouard was learned on his trips around the world coming back with us to

 on the object rome when we got back on the boat floating on the waves mother lost some there was
 a young reporter named a of the blessing the captain had con mcfarlane and joe morris who had ceded her

 on albert s stage to among the passengers and crew noth eggies where we were welcomed as old ing was
 found until mother surrendered friends the bishop came with us as well as miss katherine hughes whom we speaking of
 souvenirs reminds me of picked up at the cabin of an old lady one my bother brought home after his

 uncle who was to the woodshed with the wash tub and captain of a sailing ship on which he a
 clean set of clothes and went over him brought his bride to england and bought with a fine comb before
 he could go to the dishes for her wedding present bed calgary vs edmonton the old moth eaten fable of
 the fox and the grapes would fittingly apply to those unprincipled people who in a dog in a manger manner
 endeavor to keep intending immigrants out of northern alberta by false statements of its climate and the nature of its
 soil no better example is at hand than the case of two gentlemen who came in only last week from
 the states with a number of others all looking for locations in the west particularly in northern alberta as soon
 as they arrived in calgary and stated their destination they were at once advised to not think of going north
 as that country was nothing but rock and timber but to settle south of calgary and the result was that
 only two actually came and their surprise at the nature and prosperity of the country was only equaled by the
 surprise with which they realized the extent of the veracity of the people of the windy city another person who
 was a travelling exponent of everlasting truth was telling the people of some of the western states a short time
 ago that this district was only a frozen wilderness forsaken by man and blighted by providence we could excuse this
 as he was only a yankee parson and didn t know any better but that the people of calgary should
 resort to the same tactics to prevent immigrants coming to northern alberta is somewhat of a surprise all northern alberta
 asks for is that it will not be blackguarded and belittled before people who are not in a position to
 know the truth we don t ask the people of the south to circulate any exaggerated reports of its virtues
 for they will require all their abilities in that line to divert immigration to their own district all we ask
 is that they will tell the truth or if being calgary land boomers they don t know how that they
 will keep quiet which favor the people of the north will appreciate they will reciprocate by keeping a dignified silence
 as to the advantages of the south which would be the greatest favor they could confer upon it edmonton bulletin

 a great population growth prior to world war i the future province had attained a population of only 73 000
 by 1901 but after a spectacular decade of growth it had reached nearly 375 000 by 1911 nevertheless canadians of
 anglo saxon origin frequently regarded this progress as a mixed blessing for included in the population of 1911 were 58
 000 european immigrants far from strengthening a british society these newcomers confronted canada with a strange and foreign culture moreover
 many englishspeaking canadians believed that european immigrants were ignorant superstitious the pawns of decadent authoritarian churches and devoid of experience
 in democracy canadians feared that the europeans if unassimilated would undermine the quality of canadian life the methodist church a

 arrival of 12 000 ukrainians in western canada in 1898 most of these ‘ after world war 1 these people
 considered themselves ukrainians although austrian and people settled in rural homogeneous ruthenian were the most common general terms colonies of
 a single though not united for them prior to the war however they came from ethnic group their numbers and
 the romania and russia as well as from the austrian assumption that they were merely the empire and were different

 and so the farms while they found employment keep coming and going during the entire service it is very lamentable
 to see so in railway construction with this out much time and thought occupied with nonside income most of the
 settlers were essentials and the truths of the gospel able to acquire livestock machinery that set forth the need of
 the inner spiritual life crowded out what shall it profit that and comfortable dwellings within four a system of religion

 believed that they were less with christ well off in a religious sense in his the low morality of the
 priesthood opinion the bukowinians were ignorant completed lawford s list of greek orthoof the most common gospel truths and dox
 shortcomings he regretted a were tendency on the part of the priests to very lax in the things that the
 word of god take intoxicating liquors with their is explicit about the sabbath is broken by dance parties in holiday
 time sunday parishioners when at weddings and afternoon once in a while men start off other feasts in 1910 he
 charged that for freight so near to the end of the week the priest in the greek church now in
 there is no hope of being home for sunday charge near here seems from his own and hence they are
 found freighting on people s report to be a disgrace to any god s day of rest lying is prevalent
 and church we are constantly hearing drunken the love of strong drink has been revellings in which the priest is
 said acquired by many in austria to be the chief actor though the people may bow to his ecclesiastical authority
 a major cause of this state of affairs they cannot rely on the leadership of such was the inability of
 the greek orthodox a one for spiritual help it is certainly a church to meet the religious needs of case
 of the blind leading the blind think the bukowinians the people had come of the absurdity of a man in
 the name of without their priests in lawford s area religion conducting a so called religious service the wind up
 of which is the drinkthe nearest greek orthodox church ing of two gallons of whiskey by the priest was at
 wostock some twenty to forty and people the priest became so intoximiles away from the settlers by 1904 cated that
 he could scarcely remain on his feet and pleaded with his parishioners to many of his neighbors had not been
 to help him home church for four years however lawford doubted that the greek orthodox lawford was still more critical
 of priests could save many souls even if the greek catholic or uniate church of the galician and romanian minority
 there were more of them and his reasons constituted a rather full commentary on groups near pakan as well as
 the greek the differences between orthodox and orthodox faults the uniate church was evangelical christianity in lawford s in his
 view cursed by worship of the view the major failing of the priests was virgin mary the tragedy was comin
 ascribing equal authority to church pleted by the 95 percent illiteracy rate of the ukrainians which prevented them traditions and
 the scriptures in con from reading the scriptures and made sequence the bukowinians accepted fables and believed in saints some
 dis them dependent upon their priests for obeyed god s explicit commands in the religious guidance mistaken belief that greek
 orthodox although the ukrainians seemed sanctions made their actions acceptable badly in need of missionaries prosely further concern with non
 essentials ob tizing was not entirely fashionable in scured important scriptural truths as lawford explained shortly after the ‘ iiiiiry
