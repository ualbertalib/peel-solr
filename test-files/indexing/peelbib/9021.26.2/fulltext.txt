 one can but wonder to catch whitefish there he camped until what brought them to this strange new out of
 feed and then went home with his land so far from home with so little money load of fish for
 several weeks after he and only the slightest knowledge of the peddled fish round the neighbourhood a language few here
 a few there a small reward for after filing on a homestead they bought the long days of cold and
 discomfort a yoke of oxen a wagon and box a plough the first few years were the bitter hard some
 tools a stove and a few necessities ones but with a few hens they raised chicfor the home among their
 settlers effects kens and the cow produced a calf either they had carpenter s tools and most of the a
 steer to sell or a heifer to raise another things required for the home calf in a year or two
 and so gradually for the first two weeks they lived in a they got ahead tent borrowed from a neighbour
 while jim another homestead was acquired this broke a few acres of virgin land smoothed one for ‘ melia which
 they proved up and it with a log drag and a home made wooden after a few years ‘ melia
 built a fine two harrow he seeded it by hand and then storey home true it was only a bit
 of a they planted a garden pillbox thing but ‘ melia was very proud jim was an expert axeman so
 building of it the log shack and a little stable for the oxen then as so often happens with people
 both roofed with sod presented no prob who live alone and see very few other 1 cm the few c
 ultivated acres and a small pasture for the oxen had to be fenced for people she and jim quarreled a
 bitter quarrel and for years they never spoke to most of the country was still unsettled with one another they
 just lived in their own horses and cattle running at large little homes on adjoining homesteads during the summer ‘
 melia was away after many years ‘ melia made a visit earning a few dollars they so badly needed back
 to norway but that was a disappointfor she was a very capable seamstress and the ladies in the nearby settlement
 of pine ment she had been away too long had lake were only too glad of her help in partly
 forgotten her native language friends and relations either were gone or were too those days of large families much of
 the clothing was homemade while she was busy with their own affairs and altogether doing that jim exchanged work with
 a she was glad to come home neighbour for his own hay requirements and then some complaint deprived jim of
 the harvesting of his few acres of oats the use of his legs and he became bed slowly little by
 little they saved their ridden ‘ melia took him into her own home pennies and got ahead a cow a
 few chic to look after him and gradually he became kens a weaner pig long hours of toil were very
 fat and as helpless as a baby expended to earn those small amounts for often when riding in that part
 of the the things they bought never under any country i would go a few miles out of my circumstances
 would they go into debt way to see them feed my horse and have maintaining always their sturdy independ lunch
 ‘ melia very small as brown and ence wizened as a russet apple and wearing in the early winter when
 the lakes were ankle length skirts would show me all the frozen ‘ melia would come home to look after
 the livestock then jim would fill the i val h lawrence a pioneer of the pine i sleigh box with
 feed for the oxen a bed i lake district is now a resident of red roll and a grub box
 for himself and leave deer i livestock then i d have to talk to jim pale the door and went
 in there was little and very fat lying in bed but they were ‘ melia sitting in the old rocker
 toil worn always so pleased to see anyone hands folded on her lap while jim was in by now they
 were getting on in years the adjoining room cold and frightened by ‘ melia s home was on the shore
 of a little the silence so they took jim to hospital lake and across the bay lived their nearest and
 made arrangements for ‘ melia s funneighbour first thing every morning he eral jim now had nothing to live for
 and looked for the smoke from ‘ melia s ehim within two days he too was dead ney one morning
 there was no smoke so ‘ melia s funeral was postponed and they he hurried around the lake to see
 why were buried the same day side by side no answer to his knock so he opcned brother and sister
 a house boat on the prairies in the early days in the canadian west the rancher or thehomesteader felt quite
 free to leave his shack for days or weeks at a time confident that on his return nothing would be
 found amiss except perhaps that passing strangers had found shelter there for the night and made use of the place
 as if they owned it such was the custom but no damage could be done and nothing would be carried
 off of more recent years a more mixed class of people have been entering the west some of them unversed
 in those traditions of the plains in which the early corners took so much pride there is a story told
 at pincher creek of a young bachelor absent from his shack while he worked for a neighbor who discovered that
 his few possessions were rapidly disappearing axe sleigh grindstone were gone no doubt some of these things had been borrowed
 in good faith by neighbors but it was bad form to take them in that way and he decided that
 he must put a stop to it and in order to do so he went home to sleep at nights
 the first night was uneventful but on the second he had a dream in which he felt that he was
 on the sea crossing the rolling billows towards his english home a noise awakened him and his amazement may be
 imagined when he discovered that his residence was actually gliding across the prairie various wild theories flashed over his mind
 as he sprang up but on looking out of his little window he found that a team of horses was
 rapidly hauling his shack away the long grass serving almost as well as snow for the purpose his indignation was
 great and just and his first impulse was to take summary vengeance but being a young man with a strong
 sense of humor he threw himself on his couch and decided to wait until morning and see the strange adventure
 through at daybreak his shack ceased its long journey and it was evident by the noises outside that it had
 reached its destination those outside imagined that this was to be its future site then the door of the shack
 opened and the rightful owner stood there smiling cheerfully on two startled men who were unhitching the horses well boys
 you needn t unhitch here he said genially i d planned to go to town this week won t you

 with differing degrees of severity the resulting atmosphere of disruption disillusion and desperation spawned increasing confrontations between polar groups state

 democrats to radical bolsheviks saw in the situation all manner of warnings or opportunities and they acted accordingly while government
 inaction or hesitancy was widely unpopular the plight of the chronically unemployed provided a more fertile field for direct action
 in april of 1935 in this atmosphere of discontent the unemployed of british columbia s relief camps went on strike
 and decided to petition ottawa in person for redress of their ignored grievances between 1 200 and 1 500 of
 them converged from the outlying districts on vancouver and there in a disciplined body they pleaded with municipal provincial and

 to initiate the comber of 1934 evans found a strike of relief mission another conference was called at kamloops to
 discuss further action and an unity league at the outbreak of the strike other mass walkout was planned for april
 he was appointed to the strategy committee 4 by this time the organizers had had more as the representative of

 province so that the british several weeks in the city support began columbia relief camp workers union be to dwindle
 a may day parade had been came a national relief camp workers a smashing success and the c c f
 had union between 1 800 and 2 000 men organized the largest indoor meeting ever about 85 per cent of
 the camp inmates held in vancouver to that time when congregated in vancouver despite a last 16 000 people jammed
 into the arena and minute attempt by the government to create an overflow crowd listened by loudspeaker the promised commission

 close money was not comactual members of the union but it was ing in arrests were made the riot act
 the union that was responsible for tightly was read police reinforcements were massimposing a discipline and order on the ed
 and mayor mcgeer formerly sympabody that was to pay off handsomely in thetic now retorted that you asked for enlisting
 public sympathy and support the bread but all you can get is bullets the men were divided into four divisions
 of government commission was not even conabout 400 men apiece these were further sidering the strikers major complaints and subdivided
 into groups and each individual it was apparent to the men that it was to had a number so that
 a striker might be be a whitewash identified as number 141 group 12 divis nothing more could be gained in
 vanion 3 the strikers committees were re couver and so evans in a mass meeting sponsible for providing food and
 accom suggested a trek to ottawa to petition in modation arranging tag days and raising person the government which had
 been money propagandizing to draw public sup ignoring their telegrams and which seemed port and formulating strategy until this unmoved
 by their plight an enthusiastic time evans had had nothing to do with disciplined and well organized body would the
 relief camp strikers but had resumed would not only gain public support but his work as an organizer for the
 workers as it moved eastward it would swell in size crowds of relief camp workers gathered in vancouver for demonstrations
 in 1935 prior to the trek to ottawa as inmates of camps along the way were attracted to its ranks
 transportation seemed no particular problem as riding the freight trains was something that most the unemployed had done during the
 depression railway police turned a blind eye on these passengers who were not bums and who were difficult to prosecute
 anyway the only difference was that now instead of a few dozen there would be several hundred on one train
 evans insisted that his idea was a spontaneous one that it had come to him on the spur of the
 moment and that it was not the result of any sinister conspiratorial forces as it was his idea and because
 of his demonstrated abilities he was elected trek leader on june 3 a total of 1 400 men left vancouver
 riding atop the canadian pacific freights 4 as the trains chugged over the mountains and down into the prairies stops
 in kamloops golden calgary medicine hat swift current and moose jaw brought out a sympathetic public who supported the trekkers
 with overnight accommodation food and money the provincial police and railroad police proved to be very cooperative holding up trains
 stopping in convenient places and advising as to the best way to combat the suffocating smoke to be encountered in
 the tunnels a divisional superintendent even had empty boxcars put on to carry the baggage by the time the army
 of men reached saskatchewan their during the march on ottawa the strikers filled all available space on the tops of
 the boxcars while the trained stopped in kamloops gested that a delegation should go to ottawa and that the federal
 government would pay relief costs for the men until they returned this was widely suspected of being a trap to
 keep the strikers in regina until the police could consolidate their position but evans was convinced that they must accept
 the offer in order to keep the support of the public so once again as the elected spokesman of the
 trek he went at the head of an eight man delegation to meet with prime minister r b bennett in
 ottawa on saturday morning june 22 the interview went badly from the start and it was obviously not to be
 a negotiating ranks numbered 1 800 a three day stopover was scheduled in regina as it was an accepted practice
 that provincial authorities would provide indigent transients with relief for that length of time the civic authorities agreed to provide
 accommodation in the fair grounds and a citizens committee had been organized to assist the strikers premier james gardiner maintained
 that as the men had been allowed to enter his province unmolested they should be allowed to leave the same
 way 15 instead the royal canadian mounted police reinforcements which had been concentrated in regina and the railroad authorities were
 asked by the federal government to request assistance in removing the trespassers in the meantime two federal cabinet ministers went
 to regina where they sugsession bennett was brusk discourteous and even insulting he subjected the clelegation to a political harangue
 on how well canada was looking after its unemployed compared to other countries how the food in the camps was
 better than what the average canadian ate how their shelter and clothing was completely adequate and how the men had
 never been treated better in their entire lives in fact they had been absolutely content and happy until agitators had
 arrived among them and stirred up trouble bennett then began to personally attack instructions of the government private evans recalling
 his drumheller days he motorists who volunteered to form a truck referred to him as a thief evans immedi convoy
 were stopped by the mounted ately reacted by calling the prime minister police a camp was to be set up
 on donata liar 6 an action which drew murmurs of ed land but section 98 of the criminal disapproval from
 more genteel quarters code was invoked making it a crime to but which guaranteed evans a place in assist the
 strikers in any way evans had canadian history arranged to make a speech on the radio at the end of
 the interview nothing had but this was now cancelled by the station been settled the delegation held platform it was
 obvious the federal authorities were interviews in sudbury fort william ken no longer using the fiction of preventing ora winnipeg
 and brandon on its way back trespassing they had decided that the trek to regina and evans was quoted as
 saying was politically dangerous and that it not that the blood of the people would run in only had to
 be stopped but it had to be the streets of regina what he actually said smashed these actions were taken
 under was that the attitude of bennett and the the alleged authority of an order in council massing of forces
 in regina convinced him which in fact had never been issued 8 that the government was preparing to smash at
 this point the trekkers decided to the trek in a welter of blood 17 the mis talk to the federal
 and provincial authorirepresentation was seen as the start of a ties about returning to the coast they had campaign to
 manipulate the public against to meet separately with each group because the trek the federal representatives refused to sit back
 in regina relief was cut off pre with premier the strikers wanted to dismier gardiner said he would continue it
 band under their own supervision directly but mayor rinle and the police chief re from regina but the government insisted
 fused to cooperate apparently under pres that the men go to an army run camp at sure from ottawa the

 refused on dership could be isolated and dealt with while evans was organizing for the mine mill smeller workers in

 stony creek this demand was countered by a mounted and stones the riot soon left the square police ultimation to
 go to the camp or take and downtown streets became a battlethe consequences evans then accepted ground as gas grenades

 threw open the great coat and then opened up his automobile and headed for calgary well the automobile flitted along
 at a nice easy gait something between 40 and 400 miles an hour with the reputable citizen at the steering
 gear after covering about 15 miles in balmy air the car gave a snort and dove ahead without diminished speed
 but with apparent reluctance the man on the wheel suddenly felt a change in the temperature in fact a most
 radical difference the air was full of frost particles gleaming like diamonds in the still cold atmosphere before he could
 turn up his coat collar his ears had snapped and his fingers began to sting his breadth came from his
 lips in great white gusts the problem was plain he had distanced the chinook that was loitering along at something
 like 20 miles an hour the cold continued until he reached home and put the automobile in the garage then
 just as he left the garage door the chinook caught up to him and the calgary man bathed and flooded
