 111 colonel in chief princess patricia s canadian light infantry the countess mountbatten of burma cd jp dl my visit 
 to my patricias in canada this year centered round the very important and impressive parade by the first battalion in 
 calgary for the change of colonels of the regiment on 9 october we were all truly sad to have to 
 say farewell to colonel sutherland after his four years of devoted service 0:ser 0:vice in that post he has greatly 
 endeared himself to the whole regiment as well as interesting himself in all aspects of regimental life and contributing greatly 
 to plans for the future we are all so grateful to him for his good care of us and his 
 leadership given on top of his onerous responsibilities in a government post and contending with the problems of health which 
 he gallantly surmounted i know we would also like to thank his wife helen for the wonderful way she has 
 supported him and also endeared herself to all patricias we are very happy to welcome as his successor as colonel 
 of the regiment brigadier general stuart graham who i am sure will also give us devoted service and leadership in 
 this most important appointment i was also very pleased to have the opportunity of again attending the exercise ric a

 solution to the problem i have established a policy within the association to hold our annual general meetings in a 
 different locale every year whenever possible 0:possi 0:ble in 1985 we met in calgary with the edmonton branch in 1986

 8 fact or fiction myth or mistake princess patricia s canadian light infantry captain h t kenny you can t 
 be in london for long without going to the zoo the nicest people go straight to the animals they love 
 the most and stay there so when christopher robin goes to the zoo he goes to where the bears are 
 and he whispers something to the third keeper from the left and doors are unlocked and we wander through dark 
 passages and up steep stairs until at last we come to the special cage and the cage is opened and 
 out trots something brown and furry and with a happy cry of oh bear christopher robin rushes into its arms 
 now the bear s name is winnie which shows what a good name for bears it is winnie the pooh 
 a a milne at the regimental museum of the princess patricia s canadian 0:cana 0:dian light infantry ppcli a charming 
 myth has existed for a number of years according to tradition winnie the pooh was a patricia long before he 
 found his way into story books he or properly she was an american black bear left at the london zoo 
 in england when the regiment left to fight in france in 1914 although it has resurfaced every 10 years or 
 so each generation has eventually agreed that there is no evidence to support the story the truth has echoed in 
 the museum corridors reluctant to be heard outside in 1981 however the london zoo erected a monument which recognized the 
 association for the regiment and the bear winnie who gave her name to winnie the pooh the museum found itself 
 in the awkward position of not being 0:be 0:ing able to confirm or deny the story we made an exhaustive 
 search of archives ship manifests personal letters nominal roles official histories and photo i bear cub by lome h c 
 ean commemorating vf friendly and famou s americanßlack bear mascot of iriiiccssfcrts canadian regiment wlio came to ihe oo inl9h 
 while her went on to in trance and who lived here known and loved by many children until jier death 
 in 93i he aye her name to minnie th pooh and mmilne and ernest shepard gave wnnie thetooh to the 
 world graphic collections all revealed the same thing nothing few original members of the regiment remain a twenty year old 
 soldier in the 1914 war would now be 93 but those that were contacted were unanimous in saying there might 
 have been a bear but i never heard about it the london zoo provided us with copies of their records 
 the acquisition and death certificates 0:certifi 0:cates for the bear and a number of newspaper articles changes had been made 
 to the acquisition certificate which reflected the fact that the bear was originally deposited in 1914 but not taken on 
 permanently until the end of the first world war it was then signed over by captain harry colebourn canadian army 
 veterinary corp fellow of the zoological society the original owners seem to have been from the second canadian infantry brigade 
 which did not include the patricias although not impossible to reconcile with this new information 0:informa 0:tion the story was 
 becoming yet more clumsy hypothetically 
 9 the patricias could have left their bear with the second infantry brigade as they prepared to embark for france 
 because that brigade already had a bear its veterinary officer would be experienced 0:ex 0:perienced the second brigade could then 
 in turn have donated the bear to the zoo unsuccessful attempts were made to locate descendants of captain colebourn in 
 light of this situation the museum was neither willing to claim the bear nor allow the story to drop it 
 was decided that a display entitled fact or fiction myth or mistake would be arranged 0:ar 0:ranged in the museum 
 describing the inconclusive story publicity 0:publici 0:ty was generated in conjunction with the display and created new leads one correspondant 
 claimed to have worked directly with the regiment s founder during the second world war he quoted the founder as 
 having told stories of the bear on several occasions one could not hang his hat on this type of evidence 
 an irate correspondant wrote us to criticize our falsified attempts to destroy a beautiful children s story by associating it 
 with regiments wars and growling black bears she quoted the encyclopedia 0:ency 0:clopedia britannica which stated that the name was 
 taken from a brown teddy bear hence in her opinion not from an ursus americanus concrete evidence emerged from winnipeg 
 it demonstrated 0:demon 0:strated that the bear was not ours fred colebourn the son of captain harry colebourn produced photographs 
 and a diary which told his father s story during the first world war in 1914 captain colebourn a veterinary 
 surgeon was heading from winnipeg by train to valcartier quebec to join his regiment he bought a bear in white 
 river ontario from a hunter who had killed 0:kill 0:ed the cub s mother the bear was called winnipeg winnie 
 for short and accompanied colebourn to england knowing that he could not take the bear to france colebourn eventually left 
 her at the london zoo in broad terms the story still has some rough edges the following questions are still 
 unanswered today captain colebourn 0:cole 0:bourn is said to have formally presented a plaque to the london zoo in 1919 
 recognizing winnie as his own why has this plaque disappeared if the bear was ascribed to captain colebourn in 1919 
 why then as early as 1921 were london papers claiming that the bear belonged to ppcli what circumstances surrounded 0:surround 
 0:ed the changes made on the acquisition certificate although the date shown is 1919 captain colebourn is shown as a 
 fellow of the zoological society a position he did not hold until sometime later one final installment remains in the 
 present story in may while conducting research at hatch court in somerset england the estate of our regiment s late 
 founder i found that the pooh tradition was even more firmly entrenched in england than in canada indeed i discovered 
 that winnie was not the only character of a a milne with a real counterpart john with the great big 
 wellington boots was well known by commander and mrs nation the owners of hatch court and christopher robin milne i 
 was told lived near dartmouth in the adjacent county of devon i found that the people around hatch court were 
 reluctant 0:reluc 0:tant to accept the new story about winnie and in fact i was forced to concede that every 
 doubt had not been removed despite the tight schedule i had with my planned research we decided to take a 
 trip to speak with christopher robin milne the son of a a milne we had hoped that perhaps some memoirs 
 of a a milne existed which might shed light on the story unfortunately 0:unfor 0:tunately during our visit it became 
 clear that no such memoirs were known to exist and that christopher milne now in his sixties 0:six 0:ties was 
 weary of a lifetime of storybook associations his recollections however were fresh and there was little doubt in his mind 
 that the bear belonged to the ppcli indeed there was no doubt at all until we sowed it one is 
 forced to conclude therefore that regardless of historical fact winnie at the london zoo has traditionally been associated with the 
 ppcli considerably more research would be necessary to paint every detail of winnie s career in the canadian army and

 12 1 ppcli 1987 a year in the life of a peacetime infantry battalion can seem a rush of faces 
 tasks and road moves 1987 was no exception as we exercised or operated from the flat land desert of suffield 
 to the crestline of the rockies and from the u s border to the northern 0:nor 0:thern yukon but everywhere 
 we went the blur of faces and tasks was brought into sharp focus by glimpses of our friends and comrades 
 giving all whenever it was required a busy year of course with fewer soldiers undertaking more and more challenging tasks 
 but a year of achievement as exemplified by our winning both the hamilton gault trophy and the hamilton gault skill 
 at arms trophy also a year of sadness as we mourned mcpls dave gray and rocky lee norman whose passings 
 were a sad loss to us all cpl mcnamara selects the new co the colonel in chief and capt willow

 impressive to the observer other highlights included a deliberate 0:deli 0:berate attack on a warsaw pact defensive position as well 
 as tank hunting exercises the final segment of ry 87 was ex prairie viper in suffield as part of the 
 ldsh rc battlegroup this exercise in canada s only desert noticeably lacking in trees included infantry armour co operation manoeuvres 
 as well as patrols and attacks on thriving plywood urban centres summer brought company involvement in the militia national 0:na 
 0:tional rank qualifying school as demo troops and as enemy force on the combat team commanders course this exercise gave 
 the company the opportunity to participate in valuable mechanized training that was somewhat different from the demands 0:de 0:mands and 
 routine of a normal battalion exercise but our enthusiasm 0:enthu 0:siasm for the exercise was enhanced by the knowledge that 
 end ex brought with it the company s summer block leave period the company returned from block leave and immediately 
 participated in a patrol school in the rocky mountain house area this exercise lasted ten days and activities ranged from 
 recce and platoon sized fighting patrols to an assault river crossing 0:cross 0:ing and concluded with a ninety kilometre helibourne 
 company fighting patrol certainly patrol school produced a record number of war stories the fall began with a one week 
 mountain school which brought with it the qualification of basic mountain warfare highlights of the week included aussie rappelling down 
 a sixty metre cliff face the very stable two rope bridge the scree runs and the six hour mountain walk 
 to the peak of mount laurie on the final day the week was a definite confidence booster and morale builder

 early hours of 16 sep we were called out to join the search for a missing german geologist herr robbach 
 before the sun went down on that same day the men of alpha company found themselves living in a abandoned 
 school in inuvik nwt 3520 km north of calgary on completion of the search a day later alpha company returned 
 to calgary via the inuvik transport company with the mayor at the helm to resume normal scheduled company activities these 
 included a week long package of pow and e e lectures which concluded with an e e exercise in conjunction

 refresher for those who had known the cold before the year of 1987 drew to a close with a successful

 in combat support company have had their own unique experience the year began with exercise rapier thrust on this exercise 
 0:ex 0:ercise combat support saw heated action chilly vigils and exhausting 0:ex 0:hausting activity pioneer platoon was as busy as 
 beavers or more accurately ground hogs digging the battalion command post bunker into the frozen prairie mortar platoon was kept 
 busy during the exercise by putting up illumination rounds for anyone and everyone mortar platoon saw little respite even on 
 return to calgary as they were sent off almost immediately on exercise limber gunner in shilo manitoba there again they 
 put on a fine show adjusting onto and engaging targets with deadly accuracy as a finale in honour of their 
 hosts j battery 3 rcha mortar platoon put up a j shaped illumination constellation back in garrison the remainder of 
 the platoons busied themselves 0:them 0:selves with the primary combat functions course cycle the biathlon team however was nowhere near 
 cfb calgary the a team had been drafted by fmc to ski for the canadian forces in international competition in 
 france the b and c teams went to petawawa for the fmc championships where the young lions of the b 
 team surprised many of the more experienced 0:ex 0:perienced teams by coming in fourth place in the military patrol competition 
 it s not the noise my ears are cold the unit biathlon team at the patrol reconnaissance competition spring activities 
 wound down just in time for a rather early and chilly exercise rendezvous 87 this proved to be a very 
 interesting exercise for all of the platoons in combat support company reconnaissance platoon formed part of the brigade screen and 
 although lacking the mobility and protection of the armoured 0:ar 0:moured reconnaissance troops the platoon performed very effectively 0:ef 0:fectively

 pioneer platoon and reconnaissance platoon constructed a soviet defensive position for one of the ranges the pioneers became famous when 
 they built a log cabin in honour of the outgoing brigade commander brigadier general clive milner after all of this 
 activity the pioneers went down to suffield to demonstrate their demolition talents by blowing up a bridge mortar platoon also 
 had a very good exercise in suffield as they proved that they were the most proficient mortar platoon in the

 platoon and the biathlon team deployed to vernon 8 c to do some ski training the year was drawing to 
 an end by the time they finished their winter activities there were a few things left to do such as 
 the company party and a few parades however this has been a time when near the end of the year 
 one can reflect on the events of the past twelve months although it has been a very busy year it 
 has been a very rewarding one and looking at the up and coming year it is likely that we will 
 be just as challenged and successful as last year if not more administration company by capt b vanderveer another successful 
 year of supporting the first battalion has come and gone for adm company this year found numerous changes in personnel 
 with many new faces trying to find the someone with continuity within the company company hq is as usual hard 
 at work and still trying to figure out where the real job stops and all the secondary duties take over 
 life in the hq is kept exciting by the cq pulling his pranks rumour has it he is now busy 
 preparing his fishing gear for a posting to whitehorse the medical platoon continues to provide the best in medical care

 who are often heard to say the most pleasant times of an eme craftsman s career are those all too 
 brief periods spent in a unit maintenance platoon during 1987 the battalion lived up to the expectations of the maintainers 
 the minor aggravations of delays within the supply system were offset 0:off 0:set by the improving standards of the unit 
 s drivers c s 88c trolling for a pc s 
 20 the new equipment received by the battalion was as much a joy to the craftsmen as to the soldiers 
 not only was there a technical challenge but the battalion benefitted from more effective 0:effec 0:tive and reliable equipment the 
 greatest challenge was the restoration of the bren gun carrier the cursing and swearing over this task was rewarded by 
 the exuberance of colonel and mrs sutherland as they were driven away on the change of colonel 0:col 0:onel of 
 the regiment parade the carrier s first passengers in 40 years this year was also a busy year for the 
 battalion s qm stores the battalion qm stores effectively supplied and fed the unit in all activities notwithstanding the aggravation 
 of dealing with the maintenance system luckily bren gun carrier parts are still stocked highlights of this year included the 
 introduction of the new small arms and the iltis both noticeably improving the battalion s 0:bat 0:talion 0:s capabilities another 
 item was of course the issue of the new uniforms which is certainly making adm coy more colorful operational support 
 namely op sar robbach and chogm were excellent opportunities to test the readiness of qm stores and adm coy as 
 a whole battalion transport platoon has had another good year the platoon has effectively moved the unit around while craftily 
 avoiding the friendly in fighting between maintenance and qm stores things have been very busy with support taskings so numerous 
 the new to and tpt wo are still wondering who is really in the platoon and what they look like

 sight in vogelsang was one of 1987 s most interesting activities for 2 ppcli during the eleven day concentration each 
 platoon ran through a number of stands and ranges run within the companies themselves activities ranged from leopard crawling 0:crawl

 lake at point targets to rappelling off a 50 metre dam d coy wishes to thank b coy for their 
 contribution towards combat simulation when they fired their 84 s into the base of the rappel site all of this 
 activity was highlighted by a battalion patrol competition 0:com 0:petition through the rugged vogelsang countryside each patrol took approximately 24 
 hours from receipt of the original warning order to the completion of the task each patrol had to deal with 
 water crossings movement through built up areas moving through open and wooded country and a demanding climb up a snowy 
 near cliff face which 4 fortunate csm judges received the chance to do not once but four times each in 
 the end after 16 different enemy transmission sites had been attacked and destroyed 16 different brilliant original plans had been

 the battalion s 0:batta 0:lion 0:s week long deployment to hammelburg the first few days of training were in the 
 form of skills stands set up by members of combat support company these varied from section room clearing drills to 
 the famous hammelburg obstacle course most platoons were then free to carry on with their own training with priority on 
 house clearing drills and preparing houses for defence the final day of training had the four rifle companies conducting their 
 own exercises in the town of bonnland with an enemy force supplied by combat support company casualty simulation treatment and 
 evacuation were exercised as well as ammunition resupply medics and stretcher bearers found themselves carrying forward ammunition then carrying out 
 the wounded through windows and mouseholes once final objectives 0:objec 0:tives were seized company hq personnel carried forward defensive stores

 26 nijmegen 1987 by lieutenant m vernon in the company of at least one hundred international teams and thousands of 
 civilian walkers four eleven man teams from the battalion became reacquainted with the dying art of distance marching at nijmegen 
 holland this year s edition of the annual four days marches spanned the period 19 to 24 july and followed 
 0:follow 0:ed fast on the heels of a decidedly active spring and summer s worth of battalion training as it 
 was teams had to be alert for any lulls in the training timetable that might allow them a half day 
 for toughening up their feet in preparation for nijmegen s 160 km the presence of military teams from all over 
 the world concentrated 0:con 0:centrated in a giant tent city on nijmegen s outskirts provided an excellent environment for fostering 
 feelings of friendly competition 0:competi 0:tion both in the raucous international beer tent and along the road route that clover 
 leafed in and out of the city four days o 1 concentrated marching 40 km daily with 25 pound weighted 
 rucksacks taught us to appreciate the marching feats of the armies of alexander and napoleon well some of us in 
 fact the pains associated with blisters were nothing compared 0:com 0:pared to the agony of suffering the same marching songs 
 for the fourth day in a row and the civilian crowds made it extremely difficult for teams to maintain a 
 comfortable pace due to the necessity of constant jockeying and speed changes initially the standard challenge was not enough for 
 the hard core elements one c company soldier saw fit to walk the entire first day with his boot bands 
 in his boots gradually however the pace of nijmegen s activities began to take its toll and soldiers were content 
 to stay with the routine when they were cruising on a very few hours sleep the town of nijmegen pulsed 
 with life at night when the entire 0:en 0:tire city centre seemed converted to one giant outdoor beer garden cafe 
 the dutch were extremely generous this was most evident on the final day s victory march when they turned out 
 in numbers and with an enthusiasm that must surely have rivalled the occasion of the town s liberation in world 
 war 11 all in all it was an excellent opportunity for striking up international 0:inter 0:national acquaintances and strengthening canada

 was mistakenly called adventure training both physically and mentally exhausting it was anything but its label it did however serve 
 as a welcome break from our rigorous training schedule the training was conducted around the beautiful bavarian town of berchtesgarden

 the summit of the watzmann mountain one of the highest peaks in germany the second went to hitler s eagle 
 s nest then over the hoher goll mountain range into austria a distance of eighteen kilometres and a height of 
 over 2500 metres the climbsite located at the base of the hoher goll provided 0:provid 0:ed the greatest challenge for 
 all it was comprised of two free climbs and two rappels the longest of which was approximately one hundred meters 
 for those who dared pry their eyes from the rock a spectacular view of the alps could be had stand 
 three bridging was run in two locations an abandoned 0:aban 0:doned quarry offered an excellent location to teach knots and 
 lashings after instruction platoons were left to set up fifty metre two rope bridges the construction and subsequent crossing of 
 the bridge proved to be hard work particularly for those with a healthy respect for heights the second site a 
 river gorge exercised 0:ex 0:ercised the platoon s ability to set up a bridge in a more tactical setting the 
 final activity was watermanship training loaded in 15 man assault boats each platoon made al5 kilometer voyage ending 0:en 0:ding

 fields where patricias first made account of themselves the blanket of mist added a respectful silence to the tour the 
 actions at bellewaerde 0:belle 0:waerde ridge sanctuary wood passchendaele and vimy france were described in great detail helping us to 
 appreciate the enormity of the sacrifice made by the regiment and by other canadians on these fields more important than 
 the actual battlefield tours however were the visits to the countless grave sites in the area a short service was 
 conducted at each of the ten cemetaries where patricias lay at rest regimental band enters menin gate guard at menin 
 gate following the last post and reveille time was taken to wander amongst the gravestones giving each of us a 
 chance to spend time with our predecessors and to reflect a small canadian 0:cana 0:dian flag was placed at the 
 foot of each grave as a memorial for most the highlight of the tour took place on the night of 
 6 november the guard commanded by major m a austdal with the battalion corps of drums and the regimental band 
 from cfb calgary attended a short memorial service at st georges memorial church at ypres on completion of the service

 among the belgian spectators a similar ceremony was conducted at the vimy memorial the next day to commemorate the victory 
 of the canadian corps which captured the ridge in april 1917 a shorter service took place at beaumont hamel the 
 site of the royal newfoundland regiment s ill fated assault on september 1 1916 of the 801 newfoundlanders who went

 on the memorial plaque below the ever vigilant bronze caribou as deputy commanding officer maj j m lapeyre said in 
 thanking the mayor of ypres you have given us an opportunity to educate a new generation of patricias and for 
 older patricias to dedicate themselves anew and thereby strengthen the regimental bonds they shall not grow old as we that

 at the chilcotin training 0:train 0:ing area in the interior of british columbia it was an abrupt change from the 
 flower pots and fog of victoria to the frosty forests of the chilcotin but the battalion took it in stride 
 and quickly got down to business deployed in support of the battalion were a detachment from 408 and 447 squadrons 
 a troop from 1 canadian engineer regiment and a forward logistics group of 1 service battalion the sappers were equipped 
 for snow clearance and the chilcotin gave them plenty to do they also found themselves involved 0:in 0:volved with the 
 rifle companies doing the traditional engineer tasks of obstacle clearance and construction the vastness of the canadian hinterlands cannot be 
 exaggerated 0:exag 0:gerated and only an enormous army could actually garrison it as a result air mobility providing the ability 
 to be in the right place at the right time is the only answer 408 and 447 helicopter squadrons worked 
 with the third battalion to achieve this enhanced mobility and though hampered by the number of aircraft 0:air 0:craft available 
 made the infantryman s job a little easier a number of administrative airlifts and tactical air assaults were conducted as

 their objective riske creek and the williams lake highway luckily for the free world an airlift to a new blocking 
 position and a heliborne counter attack finished 0:finish 0:ed off the enemy s resolve and once again the world was 
 safe for free enterprise the exercise was considered a success by all concerned and the lessons learned by the third 
 battalion and supporting arms were poignantly underscored by actual experience besides the conduct of operations lessons about our land and 
 its qualities of vastness harshness and unforgivingness were brought home to all who travelled the chilcotin ex spring run by

 integrated themselves into the company training programs but at the same time managed to get out and do some training 
 of their own the pioneers made use of their hydraulic equipment and recce platoon did a lot of navigation work 
 with some imagination and manipulation the time spent in the united states was well used ammunition shortages hampered 0:ham 0:pered 
 range work to some extent but the troops still managed to fire the 84mm sub calibre at a jeep driven 
 moving target and fired the hmg and gpmg by day and night they also threw grenades fired 60mm mortars and 
 launched smoke grenades from their rifles use was also made of fort lewis specialty facilities including 0:in 0:cluding a live

 this exercise contained some very valuable training 0:train 0:ing and all commanders came away from it a little wiser and 
 more experienced the next bright spots in the training were the two battalion exercises these pitched company against company with 
 each acting as enemy for half of a day mounted operations were the main focus and squadrons of the ldsh

 14 october after many months of rumors planning and anticipation 3 ppcli reinforced by c coy 1 ppcli deployed to 
 kelowna and vancouver to partake in a major security operation for the commonwealth heads of government conference the commonwealth leaders 
 went to kelowna to take part in a one day retreat from their hectic conference schedule due to the possibility 
 of terrorism the conference organizers requested the third battalion and a contingent of rcmp to provide the needed security as 
 part of the overall operation the battalion was tasked with securing the perimeters of the vancouver international and kelowna airports 
 and a portion of the motorcade route these operations entailed extensive woods clearing and the manning of strategically placed observation 
 posts the operation was made interesting in that the companies worked in close conjunction with the rcmp any unusual activity 
 sighted by the soldiers short of emergency situations was to be reported first to the police 0:po 0:lice for investigation 
 only in the event of a deliberate breach of the security net were the military required to assist with forceful 
 restraint with the rcmp and fortunately this did not occur the task was of benefit to the battalion as it 
 provided an insight 0:in 0:sight into armed assistance duty with the civil police it also provided 0:pro 0:vided for good 
 public relations as the operation was highlighted in the local and national medias it is difficult to determine what degree 
 of deterrence the security precautions had on any prospective 0:pro 0:spective terrorists but owing to the fact that all the 
 delegates left without incident the operation can be deemed quite successful 
 39 apocalypse now red rooster can i have your no 21 delivered snow pier an adventure by captain j l 
 s beausejour by december first everybody in the battalion knew that the redland anti satellite satellite asat would fall somewhere 
 in the region of hay river nwt we also knew that the redlanders had deployed several special forces units in 
 the area with the mission of finding as many pieces of the satellite as possible and smuggling them back to 
 redland no this is not the beginning of a science fiction article but the scenario for exercise snow pier which 
 took place between 29 november and 20 december 1987 more than 600 personnel from 10 different units participated in this 
 winter exercise since hay river airfield had to be occupied before the insurgents 0:in 0:surgents could capture it the battalion 
 vanguard of alpha company 0:com 0:pany was the first on the ground followed shortly by bravo once the deployment phase 
 was completed with mild temperatures prevailing the troops started their acclimatization this was followed by survival and helicopter training during 
 these days everyone had an opportunity to become acquainted with their tent mates it was during this phase that c 
 company realized that just because something has a periscope it is not necessarily a submarine 0:sub 0:marine we also conducted 
 an open house for the citizens of hay river and displayed our weapons equipment and vehicles to the 1200 or 
 so locals who visited the citizens and community of hay river also made us feel welcome the asat finally fell 
 very close to hay river boy were we lucky the battalion was then deployed and the search began it seemed 
 that the satellite had conveniently broken into three pieces on re entry and had even more conveniently deposited one piece 
 in each company s search area c company found a retro rocket within hours of deploying b company located the 
 all important nosecone however a company found their piece of the asat in the hands of a crack commando team 
 from redland which was commanded by a terrorist known as the fur hat unfortunately following a fierce battle the commando 
 team withdrew but in possession of the flight recorder little black box it did not take the co and his 
 staff long to plan a series of blocking position and ambushes in order to capture the enemy the largest helicopter 
 operation ever seen since exercise winter wolverine was set into action and the whole battalion 0:bat 0:talion was in their 
 new position in no time all we had to do was wait for our prey to show which did not 
 take long after b and c company took a bite out of the enemy they were completely annihilated 0:an 0:nihilated 
 by a company s ambush upon entering the killing zone to verify their kills the ambushers found only two things 
 still in good shape the black box and a blood stained fur hat once again for 3 ppcli it was

 42 our first 75 years captain s m sawyer regimental 75th anniversary coordinator in august 1914 our regiment was founded 
 by a man who cared deeply about his fellow man andrew hamilton gault his indomitable 0:indo 0:mitable spirit and his 
 legendary feats are well chronicled in our regimental 0:regi 0:mental history but he left us with a living legacy the 
 regimental family our family includes those currently wearing the uniform and those who continue to serve the regiment through their 
 membership in the ppcli association some of our sons have lost contact with the regiment for reasons of their own 
 and in 1989 we hope to welcome them back to the family celebrations to mark the 75th anniversary of our 
 founding are planned throughout 1989 beginning on the 17th of march and ending 0:en 0:ding on the 11th of november 
 but why you might ask are we making 0:mak 0:ing such a big deal about the 75th anniversary the answer 
 i believe was best expressed by rod middleton president of the ppcli association in last year s patrician 1989 is 
 in all likelihood the last opportunity that we will have to gather in one place representatives from every generation of 
 the regimental family patricias everywhere will begin observance of our 75th anniversary 0:anniver 0:sary by celebrating regimental day on the 
 17th of march 1989 activities 0:acti 0:vities will be regional in nature and should be highlighted by the traditional 0:tradi 
 0:tional broom i 100 games the battalions will observe the anniversaries 0:anniver 0:saries of the battles of frezenberg and kapyong 
 in may and april respectively other regional events will be confirmed in the near future and will be publicized as 
 plans become firm the national reunion in calgary has been planned for 10 13 august 1989 and will be co 
 hosted by 1 ppcli and the ppcli association the intention is to gather together and reunite as many serving and 
 retired members of the regiment as possible membership 0:member 0:ship in the association is not mandatory anyone who has ever 
 served 0:serv 0:ed the regiment in any capacity is more than welcome travel and accommodation are usually the first concerns 
 everyone has when planning holidays rest assured that regimental headquarters has been working on your behalf to get the best 
 deals available for soldiers tasked for events such as the trooping travel will be by service air and accommodations will 
 be in military quarters for the majority of our out of town guests rhq will obtain a reduced rate on 
 commercial airlines and a reduced rate in local hotels economy accommodation will be available for both singles and couples in 
 the university of calgary student residences for those who require ry facilities a park will be established at bishop carroll 
 high school which is located outside the currie barracks main gate details will be forthcoming once the industries firm up 
 their 1989 prices once in calgary you will need to know where to go and what to do once you 
 get there a reception centre will be set up at the university 0:uni 0:versity of calgary where you will be 
 able to obtain the location of your accommodation plus a detailed itinerary including information on where and when to meet 
 the buses to transport you between each event the first event in which most people will be interested is the 
 opening of the better ole building af 16 in currie barracks will be transformed into a series of trenches designed 
 to reflect different periods of our wartime history the better ole will open at 1600 hrs 10 august and will 
 close at 2000 hrs 13 august during this period all other bar facilities in currie barracks will be closed in 
 order to prevent the disintegration of our family reunion into segregated 0:se 0:gregated areas the better ole will provide a 
 meeting place for all members of the regiment to renew old acquaintances and make new ones the opening of the 
 new museum facility at 1000 hrs 11 august will be one of the most important events of the reunion those 
 who have had the opportunity to see the present museum will know that we have a great collection of priceless 
 artifacts which are presently housed in a building which does not meet museum standards for their preservation the regimental museum 
 will be relocated in part of the calgary military museum which will be in what is now the sir sam 
 steele school in the currie pmq area following the museum opening you will have the opportunity to tour the facility 
 before attending a luncheon on the museum grounds you won t have time to be idle though because you will 
 be transported to the sarcee training area at 1400 hrs to view a military display put on by members of 
 the first battalion the details of this display have yet to be finalized but rest assured that you will be 
 treated to a thoroughly professional show at 1900 hrs 11 august the ppcli association will host their members at a 
 dinner and concert to be held in the calgary convention 0:conven 0:tion centre the concert will be a variety of 
 performances by the regimental 0:re 0:gimental band the corps of drums and a few surprise acts that rod middleton is 
 working on we have invited the royal green jackets peninsula band as well as the edmonton city police pipe band 
 to participate in this event and hopefully they will be able to attend the next day 12 august begins at 
 1200 hrs when you will be transported to the university of calgary to attend a luncheon following 0:follow 0:ing lunch 
 we will expect everyone to be seated in the speed skating oval by 1400 hrs to view the regimental trooping 
 of the colours guards will be provided by 1 2 3 and 4 ppcli and 2 airborne commando 0:com 0:mando 
 the colours of all units will be on parade as well as our regimental 0:regi 0:mental band the units corps 
 of drums the old guard and hopefully 0:hope 0:fully the royal green jackets band and the edmonton city police pipe 
 band there will be an all ranks dinner and dance at 1900 hrs the location has yet to be confirmed 
 but you will definitely be kept informed 0:inform 0:ed as our plans take shape our plans include a buffet dinner 
 with dancing to a live band and a disc jockey on sunday the 13th august we will transport you from 
 calgary to lake louise where a memorial service will be held at chateau lake louise not many are aware of 
 the fact that canada s national parks were original formed to honour those who gave their lives to canada s 
 cause during the first world war it is only fitting then that our memorial service be held in one of 
 the most beautiful spots in our first national park following the service we will be entertained by our military bands 
 while we enjoy a picnic lunch the weekend will have finally drawn to a close and we will part having 
 made new friends renewed old acquaintances and having had a good time at our family reunion on the ninth of 
 september 1989 a ceremony will be held on parliament hill in ottawa to celebrate the 75th anniversary of both the 
 ppcli and the r22er both regiments will have contingents in this unique celebration the anniversary year will end by the 
 observance 0:obser 0:vance of remembrance day wherever there are patricias for those too young to remember it will be a 
 time to think about all the members 0:mem 0:bers of our regiment who have gone before us soldiers whose efforts 
 0:ef 0:forts and sacrifices ensured that the ppcli earned a significant place in canadian military history the problem facing planners 
 is the inability to know how to reestablish 0:re 0:establish contact with patricias whose whereabouts are unknown to the regiment 
 if you know someone who once served the regiment either as a patricia or as one who supported the patricias 
 but who presently is out of contact with us please pass the word about our celebrations and encourage them to 
 attend everything they are able in this way we hope to attract the maximum number of patricias to all our 
 events should anyone require any more information please do not hesitate to phone captain steve sawyer in calgary at local 
 7939 for those not on csn line phone 403 240 7939 during the month of sept 1988 a toll free 
 number will be established in calgary and will be well publicized so that you can pass it on to anyone 
 you meet who was either a member of or who served with the regiment as the inheritors of our founder 
 s legacy it is up to each and every one of us to ensure that his spirit pervades every event 
 of the celebration of our first 75 years

 major p g kenward 2 cdo found itself celebrating the new year in observation posts command posts and the ledra 
 palace listening intently to the chant of the koran and the whine of cats fighting in the alleys of nicosia 
 after settling into its new refuge the cdo became officially affiliated with the british parachute regiment an event over which 
 hrh prince charles presided the cdo then quickly set its sights on the unficyp military skills competition the canadian 0:cana

 and effectively earned the respect of the entire un contingent physical fitness has always been taken very seriously in 2 
 cdo and the tour in cyprus brought about some new means of exercising this facet of our existence while in 
 cyprus someone 0:some 0:one decided that it might be a good idea to run around the scenic island somebody else 
 liked the idea so off we went running 0:run 0:ning a distance of over 500 miles during the tour in 
 addition platoons 0:pla 0:toons were instructed to conduct a two by ten miler during platoon 0:pla 0:toon training weeks this 
 meant that after six months on the island every member of 2 cdo had completed at least five of them 
 the wolseley barracks obstacle course also made life in cyprus interesting this short but extremely challenging course emphasized upper body 
 strength and proved to be the source of countless early morning grunts and groans the commanding officer also implemented his 
 own version of the canadian forces physical fitness test promptly coined as the 2 cdo miniironman 0:mini 0:ironman competition it 
 consisted of a four mile run completed in under 26 minutes 15 chin ups 50 push ups 50 sit ups 
 and 15 military presses with a 75 pound bar each to be completed within one minute there was a maximum 
 rest period of three minutes between each event and needless to say everyone looked forward to this monthly test sgt

 line and a true testament to the cdo s determination 0:deter 0:mination despite what could only be called a very 
 successful tour the men of 2 cdo were very glad to return to canada in march and to begin preparations 
 for exercise rendezvous ry 87 canada soon after returning from cyprus the cdo began preparing for ry 87 unfortunately sporatic 
 snow storms during march 87 kept the cdo out of the air and on the ground throughout pre rv 87 
 training nonetheless after five weeks back in canada 2 cdo set off for wainwright feeling quite confident and anxious to 
 get down to some honest soldiering ry 87 saw the cdo conduct 0:con 0:duct extensive training in patrolling and airmobile 
 operations during the divisional field training exercise 2 cdo then concentrated 0:con 0:centrated on defensive operations and its enemy force 
 task to defend against mechanized infantry the most serious threat ended up being the relentless mosquito attacks while our nerves

 airmobile transport cpl mcmullen and tpr blakely 8 pi ever vigilant at last a free taxi with ry 87 nearly 
 over 2 cdo wanted nothing more than an airborne operation and it was hoped that the regimental field training exercise 
 would provide that opportunity however hopes quickly began to wane and morale quickly dropped as high winds led to the 
 stop drops of one chalk after another as the rest of the airborne regiment headed back to wainwright by bus 
 the commanding officer decided that 2 cdo would spend the night in the cfb edmonton nose dock and made a 
 final attempt 0:at 0:tempt at a jump the next day as fate would have it 2 cdo became the only 
 unit fortunate enough to jump back into wainwright 0:wain 0:wright and onto the precarious drop zone rifles range the dco

 budget constraints confined the training to the less than adventurous 0:adven 0:turous petawawa area looking forward to a change of 
 pace the cdo broke off into 0:in 0:to four groups in pursuit of adventure one group canoed the mighty baron 
 river in algonquin provincial park while another went on a five day bike tour there was also survival training and 
 sport parachuting for the more adventuresome running rapids that turned quickly into falls dodging four wheeled traffic setting snares and 
 free falling proved to be a welcomed break from our more usual rigorous training during the summer months the unit 
 was dispersed to a myriad of summer taskings however we did manage to pull together in august for the regimental 
 change of command parade the fall brought on new challenges that saw 2 cdo very well represented in the special 
 service force ssf ironman competition and the ssf osons challenge there was also the mountain warfare course which left each 
 man who completed it with a true sense of accomplishment shortly afterwards the lt minor and mcpl scheidl learning how

 51 the ppcli battle school captain r w lewis adjutant recruit company just think of how the soldier is treated 
 while still a child he is shut up in the barracks during his training he is always knocked about if 
 he makes the least mistake he is scolded and beaten he is battered and bruised with flogging on the march 
 they hang heavy loads around his neck like that of an ass and he is made to walk great distances 
 lucky to be fed and watered at the end egyptian ca 1500 b c obviously things were tough in the 
 pharoah s battle school and it appears that the human rights charter of ancient egypt was rather primitive as well 
 not so in wainwright and although it may be disputed by certain older members of the regiment progress over the 
 last 3 487 years has allowed for less harsh treatment of recruits certainly flogging knocking about and other forms of 
 battering are definitely out conversely such things as scolding and shutting up in barracks remain invaluable aids to training as 
 any master corporal will tell you in addition technological advances in engineering allow us now through the miracle of the 
 rucksack strap to hang heavy loads on our backs rather than our necks thus a modern day recruit is seldom 
 compared to an ass however he knows if he makes the least mistake he is liable to be grouped with 
 some other form of grotesque animal vegetable or mineral so maybe things haven t changed that much from the times 
 of our egyptian pre 1 decessors as the quote shows training to be a soldier has never been an easy 
 task nor is it expected to be by those who have chosen the vocation during the past year two hundred 
 and three candidates 0:candi 0:dates aspiring to be infantrymen entered into the battle school training program of these 162 successfully 
 graduated after completing sixteen weeks of basic training in addition to the ten weeks of instruction they had previously received 
 at the cfrs cornwallis august and september were the busiest months with four platoons training simultaneously on the six graduation 
 parades held for recruit company throughout the year reviewing officers attended from both the first and third battalions to inspect 
 the soldiers they were welcoming 0:wel 0:coming to their units other inspecting dignitaries included the british liaison officer to camp 
 wainwright lcol w r clarke mbe and a ninety two year old wwi veteran floyd emery who is a member 
 in good standing of the local legion notably 1987 was also memorable as the last time that battle school soldiers 
 would train with fnci and c 2 rifles the graduation of passchendaele platoon in december saw the last of these 
 weapons turned in to camp msa and replaced with the new family of small arms for all future recruit training 
 lcol bragdon discussing the finer points of soldiering with mr floyd emery reviewing officer for passchendaele platoon yeah i know 
 you re an old soldier floyd but how many jumps do you have lt gerenda pi comd passchendaele platoon thought 
 it appropriate to make a presentation to oc recruit company at the graduation ceremony it s actually a petition asking 
 capt pollock to remove his beard significant incidents can sometimes be born of tedium and who in recruit company can

 for some this occasion made a lasting impression that they ll remember until cra the egyptians may have beaten flogged 
 and starved their men but it s highly unlikely they burst into their quarters in the middle of the night

 mid december the last platoon had graduated leaving the chief clerk to count his blessings at not having to prepare 
 lta claims to send people all over the country it also gave the officers and senior ncos a break at

 of training support company two serials of each were conducted during 1987 graduating 65 students in the former category and 
 45 of the latter wwics are held for candidates throughout fmc and are specifically designed to pass on the necessary 
 skills to enable section commanders and above to survive and fight under arctic 0:arc 0:tic conditions because the wainwright winters 
 have been less than cooperative over the past few years the field training portions 0:por 0:tions of this course were 
 held in gjoa haven and coppermine nwt during 1987 this not only enabled participants to rub noses with the inuit 
 but also resulted in some impressive hunting trophies learning the ropes as a rappel master is a business which requires 
 considerable concentration and attention to detail despite the fact that it is the shortest of any of the courses run 
 by the battle school the candidates are required to be physically fit alert and have some previous experience in knots 
 and the like the safety considerations are also a prime focus since rappelling out of a helicopter at ninety feet 
 is not something to be taken lightly currency of qualification must also be maintained on a yearly basis so the

 wide variety of activities ranging the spectrum from military parades to civilian concerts variety is indeed a way of life 
 for a military musician the month of january was a quiet time for the band we used 0:us 0:ed this 
 time to our advantage by preparing the music that we knew was required for the inspection by the supervisor of 
 music cdr morrison cd our annual inspection by cdr morrison took place from 9 to 12 february during this time 
 the marching dance and concert bands were put through their paces the long hours of attention to military and musical 
 detail paid off in the band being given a highly satisfactory report by the supervisor the lone candidate this year

 excellent display and performance of the band in september our new co arrived and after rebadging captain embree set about 
 getting the band and its 7700 pounds of equipment prepared for a european fall tour though new to this band 
 he had reconnoitered the tour during the summer so he was familiar with what we were to do after much

 turnout at the numerous regimental activities of the past year the highlight of every month is the regular patricia luncheon 
 0:lunch 0:eon at the army ottawa officers mess well one could call it a luncheon but it never makes it 
 into the dining room it is an ideal opportunity to get away from the office to reminisce about the good

 the ppcli meet and greet on 10 september imaginative scheduling had the meet and greet for regimental officers concurrent with 
 that of the army ottawa officers mess and several tables were reserved 0:reserv 0:ed for ppcli members and their guests

 hideaway in central canada was descended 0:descend 0:ed on by the commanding officers and assorted other senior patricias for the 
 annual merit board and infantry conference this made for a particularly lively thursday lunch in the stables it seemed that

 of view fmc headquarters has always seemed a little like the cpr another all powerful monopoly run for the benefit 
 of central canadians and like the cpr it s been a great outlet for our frustrations we knew we could 
 always blame our troubles on fmchq because no one from the regiment worked there anyway in 1987 though sacpm supreme 
 allied commander patricia mafia launched an audacious plan to change all that with the stroke of a posting message a 
 wave of elite patricia stafftruppen was launched against an unsuspecting army headquarters 0:head 0:quarters their mission to seize the centres 
 of power to root out pockets of royal and van doo resistance and generally to boldly go where few patricias 
 had gone before so far the operation has been a brilliant success after seizing 0:seiz 0:ing the vital ground coffee 
 machines and infiltrating our operatives into such key positions as dcomd mgen foster dcos res col kempling sso inf lcol

 bolstered by the appearance of our agents in rss montreal and the language school approached one hundred per cent even 
 the ppcli battalion at bfc saint jean was represented by mcpl ferron it must have been a good event as 
 col kempling and maj liggett were still telling war stories two hours after the bar closed this event also marked

 by a ringer from valcartier battled the old guys to a thrilling finish victory was within our grasp but the 
 killer instinct was softened by our immense respect for the elderly and we decided to let the senior patricias win 
 one the last major event of the year was a dinner in december to honour col j s h kempling 
 on his retirement the meal was excellent and the speeches brief as a parting gift col kempling was presented with 
 a book containing congratulatory messages not only from all over the country but from australia the u s a and 
 germany as well i am sure he will cherish the gifts and memories a long time or at least until 
 he gets his final mess bill in summary war histories of the future will proclaim that the patricia invasion of 
 fmchq in 1987 was a major success we may not have complete control of the decision making process 0:pro 0:cess 
 yet but we definitely have shown those other regiments how to have a good time and with plans already afoot 
 for several major events in 1988 we ll continue to do so however let s not get complacent about this 
 if we re to have a good regimental organization we need one thing more and that s volunteers so forget

 in west germany for a short notice four month tour of northern ireland more news to follow when we return 
 in november the battalion left tidworth in january 1987 where we had spent three happy busy years and took over 
 mercer barracks in osnaburck from the green howards the barracks is a mix of single story temporary built accommodation blocks 
 large garages for our vehicles and some modern stores the original buildings were erected to house the army of occupation 
 after the last war and it was not envisaged that they would last for more than 10 15 years forty 
 years later we are still here inside 0:in 0:side the barrack blocks a transformation has occurred and the accommodation is 
 modern comfortable and spacious a great difference from tidworth this year began in earnest with training for the mortar platoon 
 0:pla 0:toon the anti tank platoon and the recce platoon the skills are basically the same all over the world 
 however mechanized warfare 0:war 0:fare poses its own problems firing the mortar from within the apc so the support platoons 
 required their own specialist conversion 0:con 0:version training meanwhile the rest were becoming acquainted with the tin beasts some of 
 the very old remembered them from celle in 1974 but the vast majority had never seen them before life took 
 a different tone with oily coveralls and swarfega being prominent at the end of april the whole battlegroup travelled by 
 road and rail to the soltau trainng area for our first taste of living breathing and thinking mechanization we had 
 some excellent training and even the weather was marvellous halfway through the news about our emergency tour to n ireland 
 was given by the commanding officer to a hushed by stoical audience from that moment until the time of writing 
 our full attention has been on n ireland training three weeks at the northern ireland training team s mercy at 
 sennalager 0:sen 0:nalager two weeks in barracks and the surrounding country a spot of leave and then back to south 
 armagh battalion headquarters 0:head 0:quarters and three rifle companies will be deployed in the province 0:pro 0:vince by sunday 19 
 july we hope to return in november on the sporting and social side the soccer and hockey teams have cleaned 
 up in the divisional and british army of the rhine baor championships the tug o war team has done well 
 to win through to the army finals and our runners have been prominent in all the local leagues and competitions 
 not many of the riflemen have had much chance to meet any local girls however give them a few weeks 
 over christmas and the new year and there is no doubt that a number of them will find delightful german 
 wives afternote it is with great sadness that we have to inform you that lance corporal thomas hewitt b company 
 was shot and killed whilst on operational duties in the village of beleek county fermanagh he was murdered by a 
 terrorist gunman on sunday 19 july having been in the province for under a week his wife and family live 
 near carlisle and our deepest sympathy goes out to them 2nd royal green jackets the 2nd battalion is approaching the 
 half way mark of its two year tour as the infantry demonstration battalion based next to the school of infantry 
 at warminster as demonstration battalion our primary function is to support the various courses and demonstrations run by the school 
 of infantry since these courses and demonstrations cover both the mechanized and non mechanized roles and functions of the infantry 
 the organization 0:organiza 0:tion of the battalion is unique in meeting the various commitments 0:com 0:mitments at the school of 
 infantry companies and individual riflemen are tasked to undertake a great variety of roles not only is this of benefit 
 in increasing the knowledge and experience of those involved but essential if the repetition of the various courses and demonstrations 
 is not to lead to boredom and over familiarity with the task at hand while our programme has been largely 
 dominated by the requirements of the school of infantry we have still found the time and scope to organize our 
 own internal training on the military side we spent a week in april firing the annual personal weapon test using 
 the new rifle sa 80 for the first time we finished up with the pleasing result of having 60 per 
 cent of those who had fired achieving the marksman standard based on these results individuals were selected to represent the 
 battalion at the south west district skill at arms meeting at which we carried off the bulk of the prizes 
 and in the process qualified to shoot at bisley a very successful and popular combat survival cadre was also held 
 in april it was memorable for the assortment of live rations given to the students in lieu of standard rations 
 during 0:dur 0:ing the final exercise in may and june we managed to hold a standard 2 signals cadre and 
 at the end of june the annual in 
 68 ter platoon competition for the bramall trophy took place on the sporting side our football team has a very 
 successful 0:suc 0:cessful season reaching the semi finals of the army cup winning the south west district football cup and 
 the very competitive warminster hospital cup we have two army novices boxing champions as well as a combined services boxer 
 we also boast the united kingdom sukokai karate champion as well as the captain of army cricket on the extramural 
 side and of historical interest was the rerunning 0:re 0:running of the officers versus sergeants mess 20 mile challenge in 
 1906 the officers mess of the second battalion 60th rifles king s royal rifle corps then stationed in india challenged 
 the sergeants mess to a 20 mile race in full marching 0:mar 0:ching order a weight of approximately 50 pounds 
 the race was duly run and on that occasion the officers mess won and as a momento very sportingly donated 
 a silver cup to the sergeants mess team to commemorate the event the cup remained with the king s rifle 
 corps until 1966 when the royal green jackets were formed and has since graced the table on many formal occasions 
 0:oc 0:casions in the sergeants mess of the second battalion a newly appointed president of the sergeants mess committee having 
 decided that the loser s cup represented a slur on the honour of the mess challenged the officers to a 
 re run of the 20 mile race again in full battle order but this time on salisbury plain the race 
 was run on a wet blustery day in february and on this occasion 0:occa 0:sion the sergeants mess won and 
 the officers mess reluctantly accepted the cup they had presented 81 years previously amongst our many distinguished visitors this year 
 we have been pleased to welcome the colonel commandant of the light division maj gen de la billiere the representative 
 colonel commandant the royal green jackets gen sir james glover and our own newly appointed colonel commandant lt gen sir 
 david ramsbotham we were particularly pleased to see lt col baskerville and maj rayment from the queen s own rifles 
 ot canada who spent two days with the battalion renewing old regimental affiliations we were to have welcomed maj gen 
 giles to lunch in may with a view to discussing the details of a forthcoming planned expedition to north america 
 however this was not to be on the appointed day just as all the officers were assembling in the mess 
 to greet general giles the commanding officer turned to the two officers who had been tasked with arranging 0:ar 0:ranging 
 general giles visit to confirm when he was arriving only to discover that despite all their homework in arranging a 
 day for the visit neither had actually remembered to invite general giles such is the pace of life at warminster 
 3rd royal green jackets the beginning of the year found the 3rd battalion preparing to return to the united kingdom 
 after a five year tour in germany as part of the british army of the rhine after a hectic training 
 year in 1986 which involved a battle group live firing exercise at the british army training unit suffield in alberta 
 in western canada followed by a divisional exercise in germany we were determined to make the most of the last 
 few months in germany apart from attending to the mundane chores of preparing for the handover over 200 soldiers managed 
 to get away for two weeks skiing in the bavarian alps on the harz mountains small parties of eight or 
 ten officers and soldiers managed to organize adventure 0:adven 0:ture training exercises one to nepal trekking in the himalayas which 
 included playing a game of elephant polo and one to the inca trail in the peruvian andes a group of 
 six officers which included 0:in 0:cluded the commanding officer organized the first regimental tobogganing race on the famous cresta run 
 at st moritz in switzerland much to the annoyance of the remainder the co won it however it was not 
 all play our bugle platoon who are equipped with the general purpose machine gun in the sustained 0:sustain 0:ed fire 
 role won the british army on the rhine baor machine gun cup for the fifth year in a row a 
 unique achievement a small parade was held in our garrison town of celle to mark our departure a band concert 
 followed by a reception in both messes was held to say goodbye to our german friends this was a doubly 
 sad occasion as it marked the last time for a while that we would have our own band who have 
 been posted to join the ist battalion by the end of march the battalion had all arrived safely in our 
 new station in colchester essex we are now part of 19 infantry 0:in 0:fantry brigade which although based in england 
 has an operational 0:opera 0:tional role in germany no sooner had we arrived here than many of us were returning 
 to germany for reconnaissances and command post exercises any thought that life back in england would be a pleasant rest 
 after serving in germany was quickly dispelled may was a frantic month of company training shooting competitions and exercises a 
 company deployed to jamaica for a month on an overseas exercise to train in the jungle while the remainder of 
 the battalion played host to c company ist battalion 0:batta 0:lion the jamaica regiment both companies enjoyed their exercises 0:exer 
 0:cises although predictably c company shivered in the wettest june in england for many years while a company enjoyed unusually 
 0:un 0:usually hot weather in jamaica july found us preparing to deploy 0:de 0:ploy anywhere in the world as part 
 of the standby spearhead group at the time of writing we are training for service in northern 0:nor 0:thern ireland 
 in case we should be sent there in an emergency one of the highlights of the year since our return 
 to england was a massed bands display in early june on horseguards 0:horse 0:guards parade by the four bands of 
 the light infantry and the royal green jackets who together comprise the light division the salute was taken on successive 
 nights by the colonel commandant 0:com 0:mandant of the royal green jackets general sir james glover hm queen elizabeth the 
 queen mother as colonel in chief of the light infantry and hrh princess alexandra in july we said goodbye to 
 captain john turner who has been our exchange officer from the princess patricia s canadian 0:cana 0:dian light infantry for 
 the last two years and his wife amelia we shall miss them both and wish them well however we are 
 just about to receive an officer from the royal australian regiment 0:regi 0:ment on a four month exchange attachment lieutenant 
 mark windus is the lucky platoon commander chosen to go to australia 0:aus 0:tralia we are also sending lieutenant aubyn 
 stewart wilson to help umpire a royal new zealand infantry regiment exercise in malaya in october so the affiliations with 
 commonwealth regiments continue to take practical form looking to the future the battalion sends a reinforced company 0:com 0:pany group 
 to the falkland islands for a four month tour during the south atlantic summer the battalion is only staying in 
 colchester 0:col 0:chester for two years before going abroad again this time for a two year tour in gibraltar in 
 the autumn of 1988 
 69 4th royal green jackets january 1987 is a milestone in the history of 4 rgj for three reasons firstly 
 with the shedding of the oxford and aylesbury companies 0:com 0:panies to the newly constituted 5 rgj 4 rgj is 
 now truly london s 0:lon 0:don 0:s volunteer rifle regiment battalion headquarters and headquarters company remain in davies street and 
 company locations are now in putney the city mile end road and west ham secondly lieutenant colonel n a johnson 
 td has taken over command and he is the first ta commanding officer for over thirteen years thirdly the battalion 
 has been incorporated into the new 56 london brigade this is a new training brigade formed within london district and 
 comprising the five foot guards battalions plus 10 bn the parachute regiment and ourselves an interesting mix the brigade 0:bri 
 0:gade derives its name and number from the famous london 56 infantry division of the first world war when raised 
 that division 0:divi 0:sion included the queen victoria rifles the queens westminsters 0:westmin 0:sters and the london rifle brigade all 
 of which are now incorporated 0:incorpo 0:rated with 4 rgj so the wheel of progress goes around but some things 
 never seen to change in late january the battalion competed in the london district 0:dis 0:trict cross country championships although 
 the team was not first spirited performances were evident from all team members and in particular lt frank gardner who 
 was second in the individual 0:in 0:dividual placings february saw an early return of battalion headquarters to baor to take 
 part in the old favourite ex hurst park this offered us all the opportunity to reacquaint ourselves with members 0:mem 
 0:bers of 12 armoured brigade who are our operational brigade grouping on the weekend of 28 feb 1 march the 
 battalion inter section 0:sec 0:tion competition was held this proved to be a demanding test of section military skills and 
 fine performances were put up by all the teams the overall winners were from c company the competition 0:com 0:petition 
 provided a good testing ground for the section teams to compete in the annual courage trophy competition our b company 
 0:com 0:pany team was second in the event and we also won the falling plate competition in april we held 
 the battalion rifle meeting at hythe and lydd this was a close fought competition between b and c companies the 
 winning team was decided with a falling plate match and the honour went to b company on 25 april we 
 gained a new city drill hall and named it holderness house in recognition of colonel richard holderness 25 years service 
 to the regiment as honorary colonel this was a very happy event and the building was officially opened by colonel 
 0:col 0:onel and alderman greville spratt who is soon to be initiated as the next lord mayor of london in 
 late may the light division organized a battle field tour of some of the normandy battles we followed the progress 
 of both light infantry and rifle regiments including our own 8 rb the old london rifle brigade the commanding officer 
 acted as a directing staff for a number of the battles and lt christopher drake from the 4th battalion joined 
 about 50 other subalterns from the division for the tour it was a great success and ds and students alike 
 came home having learned a great deal of the reality of warfare june brought the first battalion exercise and this 
 was organized 0:or 0:ganized on dartmoor the exercise was physically and mentally demanding the former made even more so by 
 the appalling weather 0:wea 0:ther conditions with driving rain and high winds characterizing the whole weekend the period ended on 
 a social and sporting high with the officers 0:of 0:ficers mess summer dance and the light division regatta at seaview 
 isle of wight sth royal green jackets life of a regular in the territorial army is rather like a science 
 fiction novel on one of those tales which plays with the idea of different time continua moving backwards and forwards 
 0:for 0:wards through history and the future there are two temporal continua in the ta and one of those is 
 variable the permanent staff live in a temporal system in which times goes by at an everincreasing 0:ever 0:increasing rate 
 in the other continuum time passes unpredictably 0:unpredic 0:tably at any rate between the speed of light and absolute zero 
 and only occasionally at the same rate as the permanent staff time continuum the effect of all this as experienced 
 ta hands will know is that it is quite an art to make the right things happen at the right 
 time well gentle reader if you re still with it read on and pick up the latest about 5 rgj 
 first our strength it is tempting to quote the pampas computer but there is the old adage of lies damned 
 0:damn 0:ed lies and statistics suffice it to assure the world that even though we have been discharging dead wood 
 our strength is increasing and we look like achieving the increase of 100 in 1987 that was our target even 
 though the battalion is in two distinct parts the rifle company county of buckinghamshire and the administrative and support city 
 of oxford there are in a funny way three ways in which the battalion is expanding and changing oxford aylesbury 
 and bletchely all have different detailed tasks to achieve the common aim of full strength companies by 1990 here at 
 oxford where there is a great emphasis on change as well as expansion life is frankly not easy some departments 
 are flourishing mt is training drivers and the medical section driven by sgt toohey late 4 rgj now ramc and 
 a professional ambulance man is thriving the signals platoon has got their first three men through the standard 1 course 
 at warminster with a second batch attending in july and the fitter section is finding fitters all over the country 
 curiously the high visibility platoons the recce and milan are swimming in deep waters 
 70 and initial hopes of early development of skills have receded slightly coordination of the disparate platoons and departments is 
 a corporate skill that is taking time to learn with major lan thomas remaining firmly committed to driving the headquarters 
 cart out of the jungle aylesbury has a different egg to hatch the high wycombe chick the plan formed last 
 year was for the high wycombe company a company to form after camp 87 and that is a plan that 
 is still on course tavra are going to beautify the acf site at high wycombe infuriatingly in the carpark of 
 the old ta centre with two portacabins which should just last the expected two and a half years to completion 
 of the new ex rtr aac currently 2 i c d company is oc a des captain don breckenridge at 
 the moment mtd has been selected for the psao post and the psi wo2 wagstaff of 3 rgj has visited 
 already those men who indicated that they would prefer to serve at high wycombe have been concentrated into 16 platoon 
 and will move lock stock and rifled barrel on 1 oct 87 after no doubt a good last party at 
 aylesbury in the meantime d company is concentrating 0:concen 0:trating on the battalion jnco cadre and upgrading after the split 
 both companies will pick up the expansion reins in earnest the most concentration on sheer expansion has been driven by 
 major bill conroy at bletchley even as the new building 0:buil 0:ding has risen from the mud in the blakelands 
 industrial estate of milton keynes so has its new occupant letter e company been raising itself at the bletchely end 
 of town encouragingly not only have the men been coming in at a very satisfactory rate but they are of 
 a high standard as well with an enthusiasm that continues after return from the depot this is a chance to 
 mention that the support given by the depot to recruit training is continuing and outstanding attendance at the course there 
 is without doubt of immense value to the battalion 0:batta 0:lion as well as the individual and returning recruits quite 
 definitely 0:definite 0:ly feel that they are green jackets on completion of the course which is as it should be 
 and so we head on towards our first annual camp no great numbers are expected there too many have done 
 other courses including recruit training one of the commanding officers stated aims at the beginning of the year was to 
 establish the identity of the companies and the battalion and we hope to further 0:fur 0:ther this at camp it 
 is also an aim that is well on the way to being achieved with an emphasis on relatively frequent in 
 the normal temporal system that is battalion activities starting with an exercise 0:ex 0:ercise on one of the coldest nights 
 of the year on salisbury plain leading up to a battalion cocktail party and sounding of retreat and a battalion 
 study weekend at oxford we have also been honoured with visits or attendance at functions by a battery of important 
 guests from the home secretary downwards whose presence even if they did not actually speak to every rifleman they say 
 certainly gave the adjutant if no one else a strong sense of role and identity the light division depot winchester 
 the period from the start of the year until the end of june has been one of growing maturity for 
 the new depot we have been lucky that the strength of the battalions has been such that the ministry of 
 defence has not allowed us many adult recruits this has meant that the junior leaders and junior soldiers have not 
 had to compete with too many adult platoons for scarce resources while the bugs are being ironed out of the 
 system the annual allocation of juniors is fixed we are allowed 138 junior leaders who are recruited at the age 
 of 16 and stay with us for 46 weeks of training which to all intents and purposes is one year 
 as their name implies they are selected for their leadership potential although to look at some of them you would 
 be forced to conclude that this quality must be very very latent in addition we are allowed 216 junior soldiers 
 per year and they stay with us for 31 weeks because of the shorter period of training and the minimum 
 ages which men can be sent to battalions particularly those which are operational these boys are recruited at a minimum 
 age of 16v2 depending on the forecast wastage rates in the six regular battalions we are allowed a certain allocation 
 of adult recruits for the six month period up to 31 march 1987 the number was 40 for the following 
 six month period the allocation became 340 this fluctation obviously caused some major administrative headaches but fortunately we had had 
 the breathing space at the beginning of the year the build up to the new numbers will be complete by 
 september and we will then be at full strength including the training which we do for the army air corps 
 the royal army pay corps and the territorial army battalions of the light division we will have 750 people under 
 training at any one time these will be organized into 15 platoons and 18 programmed 0:pro 0:grammed streams which will 
 generate an annual training requirement 0:re 0:quirement for approximately 40 000 teaching periods this gets to be something of a 
 headache we have not found a computer programme capable of handling it and we employ major ron cassidy as a 
 training adjutant to control manually the resources allocation problem we are always worried lest he should trip over knock his 
 head and all the knowledge will fall out this general description has left little room for other news the light 
 division depot is the 1987 army minor unit soccer champions about which everyone is very pleased and the priority 0:priori 
 0:ty placed on this soldier s sport has been vindicated the shooting team won all the main minor unit team 
 trophies at the south east district skill at arms meeting and hopes to do well at bisley the free fall 
 parachute team is currently competing in the national championships and we will report any successes next time around members of 
 affiliated units are very welcome to visit the new depot some units do not particularly welcome too many visitors because 
 of the disruption it causes but as the newest barracks in the army we are so inundated that a few 
 more will not make any difference 
 71 the royal australian regiment 1987 the royal australian regiment had an eventful year in 1987 the wide variety of 
 specializations within the battalions saw soldiers employed on tasks ranging from operational deployments to fighting bush fires and aid to 
 the civil community the battalions continued to develop their specialized capabilities throughout the year of particular note were the battalion 
 parachute deployments conducted by 3 rar and the brigade mechanized exercise in which 5 7 rar mech took part of 
 course the year would not be complete without the fiercely contested 0:con 0:tested sporting and inter battalion competitions which are 
 mentioned below 1988 promises to be an exciting year for the regiment on both the personnel and equipment fronts as 
 part of australia s bicentennial activities the regiment is providing the buckingham palace guard for several weeks over the anzac 
 day period in april this is the first time in many years that the australian army 0:ar 0:my has provided 
 the guard the regiment is also heavily committed to the australia wide bicentennial military tattoo the new year should see 
 the introduction of disruptive pattern uniforms new individual load carrying equipment the replacement rifle stey augi the minimi light support 
 weapon new light mortars and bullet trap grenades it appears that 1988 will be at least as busy and rewarding 
 as 1987 ist battalion in a year full of activities and achievements for the battalion there were several highlights first 
 and foremost was the short notice deployment of a company 0:com 0:pany group to the waters off fiji on operation 
 morris dance in may this was in response to the first of two coups in fiji last year although the 
 operation did not require the company to go ashore it was a useful and important test of the army s 
 operational deployment force odf the battalion was congratulated for its efforts 0:ef 0:forts by the prime minister the battalion again 
 won the duke of gloucester cup for the champion section of the rar thus giving it the opportunity to defend 
 its position as winner of the 1986 cambrian patrol competition a contingent travelled to the uk and finished with a 
 silver medal the battalion also won the royal ulster rifle trophy champion battalion at shooting for the third year running 
 the remainder of the year was filled with the demands of training interspersed with other varied activities such as bush 
 fire fighting and sport the highlight of 1988 promises to be the celebration 0:celebra 0:tion of the battalion s 40th 
 birthday with a presentation of new colours on 12 may 1988 2nd 4th battalion the battalion concentrated on basic military 
 skills during 1987 the two major exercises eager eaglet and swift eagle confirmed its ability to meet the demands that 
 are placed on the odf priority battalion the battalion also performed well in other areas winning the north queensland rugby 
 union grand final and coming second in the area australian rules football competition the battalion also performed well in shooting 
 during the year providing two members for the army top 50 club and also having sgt p j daly compete 
 with the australian team in brunei during the year the battalion was also successful in cricket and tennis completing a 
 good year 3rd battalion in 1987 3 rar displayed that the australian army now has a potent parachute capability exercise 
 far canopy a deployment to a forward mounting base followed by a parachute assault to secure an airstrip was the 
 major activity for the year the battalion formed 0:form 0:ed the exercise enemy for the 6 brigade exercise diamond 0:dia 
 0:mond dollar and conducted a free fall insertion of the reconnaissance platoon and battalion drop of over 450 personnel from 
 eight hercules elements of the battalion also participated in other exercises including parachute insertions at the field force battle school 
 queensland the infantry centre in new south wales and south tasmania the battalion training programme was hectic with much interesting 
 0:in 0:teresting and varied training particularly at company level this preparation was necessary as the battalion s operational readiness has 
 been upgraded to reflect its ability to deploy quickly 
 72 sth 7th battalion mechanized in 1987 5 7 rar mech achieved high standards in military skills and sporting prowess 
 a busy year saw the battalion involved in exercises in and outside australia and in numerous other activities the inter 
 section military skills competition was a gruelling test of endurance conducted over 90 km in five days with the winning 
 section going on to represent 0:repre 0:sent the battalion in the duke of gloucester cup unit exercises culminated in the 
 1 brigade live firing and battalion group exercises during the exercise the battalion 0:bat 0:talion covered approximately 40 000 km 
 in its 81 armoured 0:ar 0:moured vehicles personnel from the battalion exercised in tonga malaysia uk and hawaii at all 
 levels from individuals to company groups the battalion also hosted visits from the armed forces of thailand malaysia brunei and 
 the united states ceremonial activities were also important with the battalion on display to families and friends fund raising 0:rais 
 0:ing activities were conducted for a local children s hospital raising 3 400 and morale boosting visits were conducted to 
 cheer up the patients the battalion had a successful year with sports winning competitions in rugby union australian rules swimming 
 and basketball even the pipes and drums were busy competing in competitions in victoria and new south wales and hosting 
 the state titles all in all 1987 was a rewarding year 6th battalion for 6 rar 1987 proved to 6c 
 both challenging and rewarding elements of the battalion had the opportunity 0:op 0:portunity to excel both in australia and overseas 
 the battalion also tested its capabilities in counterinsurgency 0:counter 0:insurgency and conventional exercises companies from the battalion trained at the 
 field force battle school and in hong kong on an exchange with 10 bn the gurkha rifles as well as 
 in the usual training areas the headquarters elements also had the opportunity to visit the u s to participate in 
 a cpx which served as a preliminary exercise to the battalion s 0:bat 0:talion 0:s deployment to the u s 
 in 1989 the battalion exercise demonstrated the essentially 0:essen 0:tially mobile nature of modern low level infantry operations 0:opera 0:tions 
 it included a mounted battalion advance and live firing company and battalion attacks it was followed by the brigade exercise 
 which was highlighted by the use of the battalions mounted amphibious and airmobile 0:air 0:mobile capabilities familiarization was also conducted 
 with the blackhawk helicopter soon to begin service with the australian army in the sporting arena results were less successful 
 than in 1986 the battalion s success in swimming was not repeated in winter sports despite all the football teams 
 and the hockey teams reaching the finals however a victory in the brigade athletics competition brought the sporting year to 
 a fitting close bth 9th battalion 1987 was an outstanding year for the battalion the duke of gloucester cup squad 
 performed creditably coming in second in the main competition and winning the macdonald cup the battalion field firing 0:fir 0:ing 
 exercise was realistic and comprehensive with the battalion carrying live ammunition for its duration the battalion exercise silk purse consolidated 
 the skills learned in platoon and company training and prepared the battalion well for the brigade exercise the week involved 
 with the protection of cooktown in far north queensland brought home the real problems the army 0:ar 0:my would be 
 likely to face in war in northern australia of particular value was the cooperation involved with the local community value 
 was also gained from the use of apcs and blackhawk helicopters in the later stages of the exercise the battalion 
 also performed well on the sporting field winning the brigade australian rules rugby and soccer competitions and performing well in 
 the other sports
