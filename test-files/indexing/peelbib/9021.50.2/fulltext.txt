 own death in 1932 robert s diary entry explains egerton s death in this way this sudden demise must have
 been caused by his putting too strong an effort in trying to bring his hearers to see what christian life
 is 7 the year that egeiton returned to white fish lake 1883 robert entered victoria college in sports the six
 footer excelled as a football player and runner he also was a gifted singer with a deep bass voice very
 popular amongst his fellow students they elected him senior stick or class president at the end of his third year

 and the stoney chief jonas goodstoney on a tour of ontario towns and cities as well as montreal 1 a
 reporter in peterborough ontario summarized robert s remarks to the large audience in that city the indians he said have
 a great respect for god and do not take his name in vain as he heard the whites do then
 he added that he was glad he had learned the language of the whites that lie might learn their good
 qualities and by god s help might help in bringing the indians to a higher knowledge of god 2 at
 one of the toronto meetings robert sang the hymn tell it again before sir john a macdonald chief pakan joined
 robert in singing it in cree although the prime minister did not realize it he had before him in robert
 steinhauer one of his most articulate native critics that very spring the cree undergraduate had written an article on the
 indian question for acta victoriana the college magazine in it he underlined the disappointments of western indians ever since the
 treaties were signed he wrote there has been much discontent and complaints made by him the indian he asks those
 who have taken the ownership of his country to give him his rights at least the fulfilment of the promises
 made to him they had wanted assistance but in the place of competent government intermediaries they received indian agents selected
 because they happen to be friends and right hand supporters of the government in power men whose knowledge of what
 they were intended to teach was so limited that they were rejected in sonic places ottawa had placed low and
 unprincipled characters in authority over them robert steinhauer worked to see his people regain their self reliance and initiative within
 a decade of graduation he had secured his own personal independence when he enfranchised in 1896 by giving up his
 legal status as a ward of the crown 1 he became a citizen with the sanie civil rights and liberties
 enjoyed by all of her majesty s subjects egerton also enfranchised but not until l 926 in robert s case
 enfranchisement brought several immediate advantages no longer faraday hall was the second building at the collegiate institute in cobourg ontario

 son hari y attended red deer for four years from age ten to fourteen and upon his discharge in 1914
 he also went to alberta college a daughter caroline was at red deer for three years from eleven to fourteen
 until her discharge in 1914 from there she went to a public school in edmonton daughter mary attended red deer
 for only one year from age eleven to twelve then too on her discharge in 1914 went to public school
 in edmonton 34 the youngest daughter ruby born in 1911 and youngest son barner born in 1913 never had to
 attend residential school at all robert arranged for them to stay in edmonton and enrol in the public school there
 when the industrial school was moved in 1924 from red deer to edmonton robert interpreted at its opening there he
 translated into cree the frank statement of charles stewart superintendent general of indian affairs that it was the white man
 s duty to educate indians and thereby help them to be assimilated ‘ perhaps in the hope that things had
 improved at the new school robert sent his adopted son larry but in 1931 when the fourteen year old boy
 ran away robert did not make him go back during the 1920 s and 30 s robert faced a continuing
 challenge from indian traditionalists at saddle lake anxious to hold onto their own old religious beliefs 3 the veteran methodist
 minister also faced opposition from the roman catholics much of the pressure to send children away to the ednionton school
 arose from the existence of a catholic boarding school at saddle lake unless protestant children went away they might end
 up there robert wanted to avoid this at all costs the catholics maintained a formidable offensive in the surrounding area
 they began a boarding school at saddle lake and also opened missions at both saddle lake and good fish lake
 rev a r aldridge a methodist minister forecast in 1908 that north of the saskatchewan is going to be largely
 french roman catholic 39 in the early twentieth century the methodists mission work in canada declined as a priority as
 the church devoted more and more of its finaiicial resources to the rapidly expanding missions in china and japan 4
 as a result robert had great difficulty in obtaining authorization fi om church offices in toronto for even small expenditures
 at white fish and good fish lakes where he served from 1903 to 1911 he lived in a poorly built
 manse reverend aldridge in fact commented after a visit in 1906 mr steinhauer s family does not seem healthy since
 he has lived in that house he lost a child lately i hear 4 yet until 1909 the church refused
 to provide the funds to build a new house they conceded but only after robert threatened to resign just after
 world war one robert supported a new pan indian political organization the league of indians of canada the league worked
 to persuade the canadian the rev egerton steinhauer is seen here with his wife elizabeth and son wesley about 1900

 tm the nature and causes of the catastrophe if a landslide determine as carefully as mcconnell knew the crowsnest pass
 area possible the condition of the strata before from previous surveys 7 he had described the the avalanche and the
 causes which led coal outcropping along the middle fork of to the breaking away of the mountain the oldman river

 explosion mercer dawson 5 dawson had died two of fire damp exceptionally bad grommnd years earlier but the new director
 robert or similar caumses or whether the results bell had also been active he later reported were due to the
 destructive effects of atmospheric weathering or other causes the first telegraphic news of the disaster which reached ottawa described it
 as a determine with especial care the present volcanic eruption but those who physical conditiomi of the moumitain with inquired
 as to its nature at the office of a view of determining the likelihood of a the survey were immediately
 informed recurrence of similar destructive that this was exceedingly unlikely and phenomena indeed almost impossible i telegraphed to mr w

 thoi ough examination the results of season and who was then in the vicinity your investigations 5 asking him to
 telegraph me a sufficiently frill description of the phenomenon he haanel the superintendemit of mines had comiiphied with my request
 and his jumrisdiction over mining activities in the description was immediately placed at north west territories he has been the
 disposal of the press and printed in appointed to his post two years previously the leading newspapers this dramatic view
 shows the main street of frank with miners in the distance who have just escaped from their mine that was
 destroyed in the 1903 slide in the wagon is one of the men who was injured their point of escape
 from the mine was in the rock slide behind the house in the left background 1 amid perhaps over the
 weekend they had leach s description and presumably copies of his report and niap from the primiters the geological sketch
 section of his map shows the compressed fold he described at a scale of 180 chains to the inch 1
 142 560 the leach map locates the line of crosssection about east west through hillcrest much of the geology that
 mccominell amid brock would describe had ahm eady been sketched for them on this map like leach they too would
 distinguish the hiniestones from the coal measures 4 but would report at 1 12 672 or over ten times the
 scale of leach s map the more detailed m rmap locates the seams that were mimied amid the trace of
 the fault that they termiiiated against leach s map has the township and range divisions indicated but what appear to
 be contours are in fact form lines sketching the shape of the country without quantifying it boyd had a major
 task ahead but he had a four day train journey to the west to prepare for it just that year
 leach had completed a map entitled geological sketch map of the blairmore frank coal fields which was at the printers
 mx leach however was only a temporary employee so haanel designated another member of bell s staff r w brock
 as a man who would carry more weight with the mining industry he was only twenty nine years old but
 already was a professor of geology mineralogy at his alma mater queen s university in kingston ontario he had graduated
 from there in 1895 and had spent the next year at heidelberg university in germany acquiring skills that left their
 marks on the frank slide report five years after the slide he became director of the geological survey and acting
 deputy minister of mines brock and mcconnell had already worked together on the development of mines in the kootenays brock
 has also been working with w h boyd a young surveyor who was at the beginning of a forty year
 career with the federal government u his name as cartographer is in the frank slide report just visible in the
 bottom left hand corner of the map the two geologists and the surveyor assembled their field gear on friday may
 mcconnell brock and boyd met leach on friday may 8 a week and two days after the tragedy trains were
 being stopped at cowley and the trio had to approach frank from the south halting perhaps to photograph the frontispiece
 picture for their report by this time the townspeople had been evacuated westwards to blairmore and beyond 5 frederick haultain
 the premier of the north west territories had ordered the evacuation his advisor cpr chief engineer a mchemiry and william
 pearce the chief inspector of surveys for the department of the interior had already returned to their duties the reconstruction
 of the cpr line was under way and presumably the hotels were open to quench the thirsts of the workmen
 the local photographers marks buchanan were not likely the source of a dark photograph of turtle mountain before the slide
 their photograph of the town of frank is better the row of miners cottages northwest of gold creek being clearly

 nearest weather stations were at calgary and pincher creek and the nearest seismograph in toronto 2 railway service was restored
 on may 24 and the geologists were back in ottawa before the end of the month 2 a summary of
 their preliminary report found its way into william pearce s article for the new york based engineering news published on
 june 4 where dr eugene haanel probably saw it for the first time 22 boyd may have required additional time
 to complete the map by compiling township surveys 2 from the federal office in calgary there he would have found
 the plans of the former route of the cpr and gold creek which appeared on his map the hachuring on
 the township survey sumggests a way of estimating the volume of the displaced material by reconstructing the pre slide topographic
 surface as a staircase with broad treads ascending the valley side the elevations of the treads can be estimated from
 the topography beyond the southern lateral margin of the slide with this rough estimate of the thickness of the displaced
 material amid an estimate of its area from the map an optimistically precise estimate of the volume of the slide
 deposits visible the mine was obviously still under construction at the time of the slide on may 10 haultain and
 mc henry cancelled the evacuation order and many of the mounted police were withdrawn at the same time the company
 decided to reopen the mine and some of the miners were back in town and available for interviews by mcconnell
 amid brock the miners comments and the marks buchanan photograph reveal nothing that would indicate that the bursting of the
 last bond by which the mass was upheld was caused by movements in the mine u mccominell and broek then
 set out to discover the causes which led to the breaking away of the niountain mass a forensic examination of
 the displaced material indicated it formed an extemisive sheet whereas an explosion would produce a crater with an elevated rim
 mud was torn from the bed of the old man river and deposited among the boulders 7 the surface of
 the displaced niaterial was formed by boulders but there were no coal measure rocks among theni again suggesting that the
 mine itself was miot involved in the slide the section through the slide however did not identify the former land
 surface below the beds of contorted rock these beds identified in the marks buchanan photograph raised comicerns about exceptionally bad
 ground tm these concerns were augmented when the geologists viewed the ground between north and south peak and the steep
 rock slopes north of north peak and overlookimig the towmi they completed their examimiation of the physical condition of the

 khondike he devoted only a short paragraph to frank in his annual report 5 brock and boyd had a few

 the slide at frank can be compared to slides that occurred in the alps 25 the site at elm m
 is interesting because the surface of rupture there is about at right angles to the foliation in the metamorphic rocks
 which were being mined for slates the slide was about a third of the volume of frank the slide at
 rossberg 27 which overwhelmed the village of goldau was larger than frank it was a slide largely along bedding as
 we now believe frank was 2 the destroyed village was re built on the deposits of the slide of 1395
 which had buried an earlier settlement 2 brock s sources for the information on the alps appear to be a
 tribute to haanel s german upbringing however all the german language authors are swiss except for reidl an austrian brock
 also slips in a reference to a rare 1807 book by k zay goldau und seine gegend which he is
