 3 colonel in chief princess patricia s canadian light infantry the countess mountbatten of burma cd jp dl i am 
 especially looking forward to my regimental visit to canada next year because unfortunately this year it did not prove possible 
 to fit suitable dates for a visit into the busy regimental program as well as my other commitments i think 
 this is only the second year i have not visited my patricias since becoming colonel in chief in 1974 luckily 
 some years i have been able make two regimental visits to both canada and europe however i never feel out 
 of touch with you all through letters from the commanding officers with news of all the battalion doings and also 
 through individual letters and personal contacts we also have a yearly reunion in london when the united kingdom association holds 
 an annual dinner in much the same way as the association does in canada and other countries in this way 
 our regimental 0:regimen 0:tal family ties remain strong as we look forward to celebrating our historic 75th anniversary together in 
 canada next year i send all my very bes wishes to you and your families 
 4 colonel of the regiment princess patricia s canadian light infantry brigadier general r s graham cd we are now 
 nicely into our anniversary year and indeed some of the many celebration events are already behind us most of the 
 larger events however are still to be held it is most gratifying to see the favourable response from across the 
 country and indeed from outside to the reunion arrangements many old patricias whom we had lost track of have surfaced 
 requesting reservations this looks well for a bang up get together of those who have served the regiment so well 
 over the years similarly the plans for the new museum are progressing well with the necessary funding now in place 
 individual and association branch requests to purchase some part of the memorial displays are also a heartwarming and encouraging response 
 this is particularly so for all those who have worked so diligently to see the fragile and hopeful plans of 
 just a few years ago now approaching fruition at the time of the dedication of the museum in august i 
 am sure there will be plenty of evidence to convince you all that this is going to be a first 
 class operation and one of which we will all be proud by the time the patrician reaches you i will 
 have seen all working components of the regiment in their various places of duty at home and abroad i can 
 truthfully say that i have been very proud to have participated in the numerous ceremonial events and to have been 
 able to bask in the reflected glory which flowed from the many accolades handed down through me to you from 
 those in higher authority or just old friends these very complimentary comments were justly earned and each of you can 
 be proud to have represented our regiment in true patricia style and standard of excellence

 13 on being a reinforcement or in search of a home it is now approaching fifty years since the start 
 of wwi i and i cannot recall ever reading anything about what it was like to be a reinforcement perhaps 
 it has been done and i have missed it many books of war experiences are coming 0:com 0:ing out these 
 days and i can t afford to buy them all but it seems to me that when books refer to 
 re they are usually talking numbers only live bodies was the military term even the phrase live bodies illustrates the 
 complete staff unconcern for those live bodies as individuals with feelings and memories for a civilian joining the army is 
 such a complete and utter reverse of anything that was known before myself i thought i new something of military 
 life because i was in a militia artillery outfit since the age of fifteen then the cotc in university right 
 away i found out that those two outfits were kindergarten i was now in the big league in 1942 there 
 were two officer training centers otc in canada one in brockville and one in gordonhead on vancouver island as i 
 joined in toronto i naturally expected to be sent to brockville asa matter of fact i had not yet heard 
 of gordonhead when i reported back to stanley barracks to be told we were all going to gordonhead five days 
 on a train good meals good companions army life seemed all right and we did get a buck i think 
 brockville we had heard was a tough place where they tried to break you mentally 0:men 0:tally or physically or 
 both gordonhead was the opposite you were treated firmly all right but fairly and the only ones rtu d returned 
 to unit deserved it and wondered what some were ever doing there in the first place also weather at gordonhead 
 was superior we wore spatts and putties into november then the rains began the final month of engineer training was 
 a breeze we were back in our element 0:ele 0:ment after all that infantry stuff the first two months but 
 now the trouble starts with being a reinforcement there are or were two engineer training centers then chilliwack 0:chil 0:liwack 
 and petawawa half of our class went to chilliwack and we never saw them again the rest of us travelled 
 east to petawawa after three months we got our second pip i e became first lieutenants and were considered fully 
 trained in military engineering now the group really started to split some older men got jobs as works engineers in 
 places like prince rupert or newfoundland or whatever sure didn t want that others got jobs as instructors in the 
 training center l didn t want that either what did happen was some two and a half months with the 
 so called trained soldiers company then off on a draft for overseas then the boredom began you see i don 
 t get overseas at least not right away our draft reached a transit camp in windsor n s soon the 
 sappers continued overseas but officers stayed behind weeks became months and we were still there officers without 0:with 0:out men 
 can t fulfil their function and we were a bored lot the camp staff didn t care what we did 
 as long as we kept out of their way there was no training syllabus as such there was an acting 
 captain in charge and each morning we would march out the gate and down the road to a waterfilled 0:water 
 0:filled quarry where we swan and sunbathed until lunch time then marched back the training syllabus said route march or 
 group recce if it rained we stayed home and the syllabus 0:sylla 0:bus said map reading or engineering calculations no 
 one checked or cared around this time i developed a hernia 0:her 0:nia from improvised bridging at petawawa so i 
 got that fixed one month in halifax military hospital plus six weeks convalescence 0:con 0:valescence leave with my wife in 
 toronto and finally sent overseas in late november 1943 so i m finally in england having been in the army 
 14 months six months training and the rest was just time spent now i m at the ceru canadian engineering 
 reinforcement 0:reinforce 0:ment unit near cove aldershot area one thing is soon apparent they have more junior officers than they 
 know what to do with but we do train quite a bit there was a motorcycle 0:motor 0:cycle course which 
 i enjoyed and we built bailey bridges across the thames so many times we know all the practical sites from 
 memory and no matter which job you drew for the exercise it was a piece of cake soon it all 
 got boring trips to london weren t much fun there was nothing to eat or drink and you could guarantee 
 if you hit it off with someone 0:some 0:one immediately one or the other would leave after the new year 
 i finally got a big break i thought a posting to 16th field coy 3rd div but not tos taken 
 on strength i was special increment which means you are with the unit wear their badges etc but only for 
 three months training usually then back to ceru at least i had a platoon of sappers for a time and 
 we were busy training ourselves and others for the coming invasion it was the best time i had had to 
 date we prepared fake defence works on a beach near boarnemouth for infantry etc to land on we built a 
 hq camp north of southhampton for 3 div had to do it in ten days that was hard work but 
 fun then i got orders togotolbth field coy and i never sawthe 16th gang again by this time we are 
 in the d day concentration area and soon it was the same thing again i was ordered to report to 
 the cbrg canadian base reinforcement group a tent camp called crookhorn x rds only a few english officers were there 
 we knew invasion was imminent and i thought my troubles were over that i would go to france or wherever 
 0:wher 0:ever with the cbrg and as soon as they needed me i would have a job meanwhile i instructed 
 infantry in demolitions and time passed one day in late may i was detailed to proceed with 50 sappers to 
 the ist cdn workshop coy at oxshott just outside 0:out 0:side london the job was to help them pull up 
 stakes and get ready to move to france they had been there over three years and had taken root so 
 well it took three weeks to pry everything loose during that time d day took place june 6 44 and 
 my friends of the 16th and 18th were in normandy i ll soon be with them i thought continued 
 14 but it was not to be with the workshop job finished i returned to the cfrb site to find 
 that unit had gone to normandy 0:nor 0:mandy and i was ordered to report to 2 cbrg a few miles 
 away i cannot recall the name of the place now but it sure doesn t matter it seems to me 
 these were all engineer types anyway we were back to training concentrating on infantry stuff which the sappers seemed to 
 have missed altogether about the only thing i recall of this period was a day when we were all to 
 fire at the rifle range transport was limited so we would march one way and ride the other our group 
 would march down and ride back it was seven or eight miles by road on a somewhat circular route we 
 marched down took our turn firing turned in targets had lunch and it was only noon our transport was not 
 scheduled 0:sched 0:uled to pick us up until after four p m i had looked at the map and it 
 was less than four miles to camp cross country i told my sgt we would walk back there was some 
 grumbling 0:grum 0:bling as we started out but i made them spread out by sections 0:sec 0:tions infantry style and 
 they soon settled down the day was fine and it was easy going on the country trails we followed compared 
 to the paved roads we had traversed that morning 0:morn 0:ing near the camp i led them into a fairly 
 deep ravine which bordered the camp this i had recced before as i d always been curious about my surroundings 
 but i m sure they all thoughttheir dumb looie was lost i ll admitto being somewhat 0:some 0:what relieved myself 
 when we scrambled up the steep side of the ravine and there was the back door of the platoon hut 
 not 40 feet away and it was not yet two o clock they were done for the day and could 
 sleep go to town or whatever 0:what 0:ever time to oneself free of orders is something precious to every private 
 soldier the story got to the camp commandant 0:comman 0:dant who queried me the next time i was orderly officer 
 i simply told him that i had decided to include a map reading and compass march exercise instead of a 
 truck ride in the days training he indicated approval so the incident was closed aside from that one incident i 
 remember very little about this period not even its length all i now know is it came to an end 
 in early july with orders for this whole outfit to disband 0:dis 0:band and return to ceru that was like 
 a death sentence to me back to ceru to build the same bridges again put up with the same chicken 
 bunch of staff some of them i had trained with holding it over me because they had a job and 
 i didn t ceru was so full of officers i had bunk at the signals 0:sig 0:nals ru 3 4 
 of a mile away to make matters worse one of my roommates got a job with aforward airfield building outfit 
 0:out 0:fit in normandy just because he was a soils expert another got a job with the americans in the 
 south pacific of all things because he was a volcanic expert in geology he took off for hawaii the same 
 day so you can imagine my frame of mind when all lieutenants 0:lieu 0:tenants were paraded told that the infantry 
 were short of officers and we could volunteer for transfer finally someone 0:some 0:one in the army was saying they 
 needed me it took about ten seconds for me to decide i stepped forward along with perhaps 30 other live 
 bodies we were gone the next morning 0:morn 0:ing to a training area near steyning west of brighton on the 
 south downs getting off the trucks we were ordered to double nowadays this would be called jogging so we doubled 
 for the next six weeks getting in beautiful shape physically and learning infantry tactics the best way by doing left 
 flanking right flanking fire and movement armour co op etc etc all of our instructors had been to normandy and 
 picked up a slight wound perhaps the talk was of the wheat fields around caen the murderous german 88mm gun 
 german tactics where is that 4th section our platoon had three sections 0:sec 0:tions theirs had four that fourth section 
 was apt to be the surprise element of their counter attacks there would always be a counter attack it was 
 all very good advice we felt we were getting the real up to date goods for normandy we finished our 
 six weeks battle training and then ten days leave three of us went to edinburgh and had a great time 
 weather now its september was unusually bright and the scots were always well disposed towards canadians a real nice interlude 
 then back to aldershot on arrival we were greeted with the expected warning order get ready to move no destination 
 given of course but we all knew we are going to normandy didn t we all volunteer to join the 
 greatest invasion in history and incidentally find a home by now i have been on active service 0:serv 0:ice as 
 they call it for more than two years trained a lot travelled a lot met a lot of people but 
 had no home which was what i wanted most at any rate we were loaded on a train one night 
 and daylight found us in scotland greenock to be exact then loaded onto a large troop transport and out into 
 the i rish sea still we didn t find anything unusual we must be landing at cherbourg we thought or 
 transferring to landing craft over there by the third day though when we were still ploughing south and in a 
 fairly large convoy we were starting 0:start 0:ing to wonder just where we were headed so finally it comes out 
 just how i don t remember but we re not going to normandy 0:nor 0:mandy and the great invasion at 
 all we are going to italy yes italy never mentioned once since that fateful day in ceru the good old 
 army has done it to me again first the gordonhead bomb shell and now this well i think i ll 
 never find a home in 3rd div now and so much for all the friends i made there because i 
 ll never see them again i never did either people are so resilient and adaptable especially 0:espe 0:cially young people 
 soon the whole ship was buzzing with talk about this unit and that unit in the ist and sth divisions 
 0:divi 0:sions my mind was made up as soon as i recalled that 1 division contained the pats ppcli or 
 to spell it out princess 0:prin 0:cess patricia s canadian light infantry some of my friends in brandon had joined 
 up after high school there being no jobs to go to osborne barracks in winnipeg was their home base they 
 were westerners like me surely i could find a home with them while still well out from naples we were 
 told we could choose any unit we liked for one ex engineer who was jewish there was only one choice 
 the irish regt now i can only recall around three of us going to the ppcli all westerners on arrival 
 at the reinforcement depot in avellino just out of naples formalities were brief we were made to feel needed and 
 could put up the badges for our chosen units immediately i had a job training in mines and demolitions seemed 
 as an ex engineer i would always draw that job but how the time slipped by i remember a remembrance 
 0:remem 0:brance day parade in avellino so we were still there november 0:novem 0:ber 11 1944 soon after i was 
 on a draft travelling north by truck convoy more than 700 miles rome sienna florence then over the mountain and 
 finally into the cbrg in fano on the adriatic coast „ continued 
 15 this place is windsor n s all over again no training no transport so we can t go far 
 we just wander around the country side looking over the old battlefields 0:batt 0:lefields and trying to piece the action 
 together christmas comes and for the third time i take part in the old army tradition 0:tra 0:dition of officers 
 serving christmas dinner to the private soldiers 0:sold 0:iers i had done this in petawawa camp ceru in england and 
 now fano italy this might be a meaningful thing in a unit where the men were yours but in this

 16 the first battalion another busy year has rolled pastto join so many others in our memories this was a 
 particularly hectic one as the other major units in 1 cbg were tasked out we took up the slack all 
 of the experiences of the battalion cannot possibly 0:possi 0:bly be covered completely here but the highlights are touched upon 
 we said farewell to the dco maj mackeown and to rsm smiley during the summer our thoughts went out to 
 people like maj blekaitis now an observer in iran iraq as usual many members were away for long periods of 
 time on tasking or on course the year started with a dismounted winter exercise in wainwright ex nordic strike this 
 proved to be an excellent refresher in the basics of winter operations 0:opera 0:tions we also conducted trials on several 
 types of trenches adopting the split hairpin immediately upon return to calgary 0:cal 0:gary we started preparations for the winter 
 olympics the battalion was on standby in case of emergency but fortunately 0:for 0:tunately nothing happened combat support company was 
 inspected by the chief of the defence staff while on standby and demonstrated our readiness the primary combat function courses 
 came next i he battalion ran a wide variety of courses ranging from anti armour to small arms coach this 
 training keeps the battalion 0:bat 0:talion supplied with personnel qualified to perform the many tasks we must be able to 
 do preparation for waincon 88 came next with adm company fixing vehicles and equipment 0:equip 0:ment while the rest of 
 us honed our skills in mid april we were off to the wilds of wainwright for the varied training in 
 which we were to engage after a busy exercise we were back to calgary for a couple of weeks to 
 prepare for suff ield and exercise prairie viper that two week live fire session was extraordinarily good training in spite 
 of difficulties we encountered with vehicles cwo smiley hands over the battalion to rsm ritchie the summer found us covering 
 most of the brigade s varied taskings our drivers were even seen behind the wheel of cougars while we conducted 
 the brigade small arms competition and participated in milcon and nrqs supporting the militia and everything else block leave was 
 given in several stages a team of mountain climbers scaled mount corbould the first of four such climbs they were 
 the first ever to reach the top of that mountain fall went by rapidly with the primary combat function courses 
 being run again and with a trip to dundurn saskatchewan for a battalion battle school the french grey cup was 
 fought for again in a fierce battle finally we wrapped up the year with the traditional men s christmas dinner 
 what follows is a view of the battalion from the eyes of our transport officer ltgreg goode a temporary patricia 
 he is a logistics officer fresh out of training his outlook proves to be rather interesting adm coy january june 
 88 by lt g goode capt vanderveer as most people were putting away their christmas decorations and gearing up for 
 the olympics 1 ppcli was offto nordic strlke adismounted winter exercise i was thinking great i am going to be 
 staying in the wilds of wainwright 0:wain 0:wright and actually rough it upon arrival the adm staff was put up 
 in barracks one and one half weeks of free room and board with numerous social gatherings at night for the 
 most part the exercise was a success lcol kennedy reminded the troops that to some extent they were still a 
 light infantry unit the thing i remember most was the human hi ab maj blekaitis digging out his bunker while 
 capt southern and mwo woodley shivered and supervised after ten days or so on the snow prairie it was back 
 to camp for a night of fun and frolicking it was hard to imagine daring senior ncos finding their way 
 through a snowy wasteland when they couldn t even find their rooms at night s end continued 
 17 an old soldier sgt munn speaks with the chief of the defence staff during cbt sp coy s tour 
 as vanguard for the winter olympics back in cfb calgary wo smith and cpl french were busy cleaning kit while 
 everyone else was preparing for the annual oeis the time of year when every battalion finds out that their equipment 
 is not 100 operational passing over this pain in the 3xb behind the battalion looks forward to the upcoming waincon 
 it is mid march and the entire battalion 0:bat 0:talion is scurrying around getting ready with the rifle companies 0:com 
 0:panies preparing for pretraining in sarcee adm coy prepares for the eventual move and set up of tent city the 
 days pass and it is now the first week of april capt vanderveer waits impatiently for brigade instructions lt goode 
 wonders if brigade is involved in this exercise mwo ebbett and capt zielinski wonder what we need 300 plus sections 
 of modular tentage for mwo olson and capt allan say we ll never fix all the vehicles in time although 
 they do apparently these are the typical reactions year after year but come deployment everything falls into place the road 
 move goes fairly well although capt lewis porsche built avgp takes the checkered flag at mid point with 1 fd 
 amb a close second he is the leader that day in the waincon rally much to the dismay of c 
 coy they are penalized by adm coy and 1 fd amb gets to wainwright before them better luck next year 
 guys finally in wainwright lcol kennedy and maj mckeown have many things planned for the next 20 days there would 
 be platoon attacks coy attacks live fire exercises and a vast array of tactical situations to push the battalion to 
 its limit the adjt is to be congratulated on a successful m 72 range also to be congratulated is the 
 battalion m 72 marksman padre mclean of adm coy maj loveridge came up with an excellent plan to take the 
 place of the annual swim site testing company by company 0:com 0:pany the battalion would cross border lake and assault 
 patricia hill pioneer pi lead by lt meikle a k a capt meikle 0:mei 0:kle and sgt mackinnon put on

 b coy wins the tactician 0:tacti 0:cian award for their approach to border lake capt ferguson 0:fergu 0:son hid his 
 company so well that mcpl andrews and capt vanderveer spent one half hour looking for them to tell them they 
 could cross the lake lcol kennedy was at lake side for most of the crossings and thoroughly enjoyed them except 
 when the rsm suggested he not take off his shirt to sun himself maintplsue waincon 88 maj mckeown has the 
 respect of the entire battalion in his tireless quest for a smooth operation he was a virtual workhorse who almost 
 never let his fatigue show almost never he wins the balance award for sleeping while in the turret of a 
 moving avgp wo descoteaux the bn tpt wo was quick to notice many of the discrepancies of other units he 
 was particularly 0:particu 0:larly peeved at the light observation helicopters flying too low low enough for him to pop them 
 out of the air with his rifle he also deserved commendation for feeding the troops through his vast experience he 
 was wise enough to take fresh rations with him on the brigade ex he kept garbage guts pte murphy and 
 pte knight s bellies full adm coy took on many rolesduring waincon 88 one such role was the co location 
 of c s 8 and c s 0 although the radio trucks were to be manned by elements of both 
 subunits 0:sub 0:units this was not actually the case since adm coy bore the brunt of the burden lt mclnnis 
 and lt ferraby were glad since the co location freed them to participate in the waincon 0:wain 0:con fishing derby 
 in the north western quadrant of the wainwright 0:wain 0:wright training area a student on the dvr wheel course checks 
 the oil on this mlvw maj loveridge and adm coy took on an entirely new role during the brigade exercise

 the next morning and low an behold maj loveridge was now part of f ech maj mckeown maj loveridge and 
 csm cabelgun developed severe ear aches the first day of the assault water crossing the padre s litis mysteriously disappeared 
 and these three veteran soldiers bore the wrath of god for most of the day cq smitty was busy with 
 staff duties for adm coy he and his trusty sidekick csm cabelguen took care of the many adm problems in 
 tent city they made sure important 0:impor 0:tant things like latrines were dug deep enough maj loveridge gets the greenpeace

 not miss one movie screening in the officers mess sometimes he screened movies two or three times to make sure

 into a hide mwo ebbett continued 
 18 saw an air force corporal sitting in his truck while everyone else played sentry the rq queried as to 
 why he wasn t on sentry and the cpl began to laugh hysterically we don t have to ask what 
 happened next it is now may 8 and the battalion is getting ready for redeployment cbt support as in the 
 brigade move assembles 0:assem 0:bles and marshals in the wrong area lt mcintosh takes over from capt lewis and is 
 clocked at a speed the to didn t think his lambourgni built avgp could attain back in calgary the routine 
 starts over again getting ready for suffield sgt burke would like to thank capt lewis lt decoste and c company 
 for adding a little spice to an otherwise mundane 0:mun 0:dane and thankless task of accident investigation suffield also changed 
 the role of many tcvs with 35 of 43 avgps breaking down in all seriousness much has been learned over 
 the past six months with all members of the battalion from the highest rank to the lowest rank making and 
 learning from their mistakes 0:mis 0:takes much has been learned and i believe the battalion as a whole has benefited 
 greatly the past six months i am sure have been enjoyable for most and i relish the fact that we 
 will be much better at our jobs come next year it is wonderful to see the immense cooperation between adm 
 coy and the other sub units without this cooperation the battalion could not function with such leaders as lcol kennedy 
 maj mckeown coy csms and ocs to name but a few it is not hard to see why this battalion 
 is among the best in the cf the training year started with exercise nordic strike 88 this was a dismounted 
 exercise in wainwright emphasizing basic infantry skills capt dennis simmons describes c company s experiences the reader can judge for 
 himself whether or not c company s tale is typical of the rest of the battalion exercise nordic strike by 
 capt d simmons this year s winter exercise nordic strike 88 was somewhat different from those of the past few 
 years we left our beloved grizzlies behind and went footborne left behind also were all the comforts of home that 
 we normally manage 0:man 0:age to pack into our faithful carriers the stark realities of footborne warfare were quickly and 
 readily thrust upon us although the grizzly drivers and crew commanders were given a reprieve from the normal 10 hour 
 road move up to wainwright we soon realized how much we depend on our vehicles take five members of b 
 coy take a break during a footborne road move arriving at battle position 102 we discovered to everyone s 0:every 
 0:one 0:s surprise that front end loaders do exist in the canadian 0:cana 0:dian forces one was sitting in the 
 middle of our future position we were brusquely informed that the only reason this marvel was available to us was 
 because we were participating 0:par 0:ticipating in a trial of a new type of trench and we should not count 
 on such luxuries as a rule that night pte cooper and mcpl wozinski accidentally discovered how quickly this marvel of 
 technology could dig by falling in a hole it had dug for the company command post we put the finishing 
 touches on the old homestead with surprising enthusiasm due to the presence of the film crew that was on hand 
 to immortalize the new trench design and its architects we had not received our fresh rations at this time but 
 it was incredible the number of hams to be seen during filming home sweet home a tent from a coy 
 is the only shelter available to this section once the position was completed our attention turned to patrolling lt steve 
 joudrey s patrol was the only patrol not to be ambushed by the enemy either going to or returning 0:return 
 0:ing from the objective it was soon discovered that this incredible feat was accomplished by a shrewd and cunning tactic 
 called aimless wandering the days passed slowly but boredom was averted by numerous ingenious distractions a company headquarters 0:headquar 0:ters 
 down in its notorious maxi shelter bunker kept its spirits up by inventing an infamous game called headbutting 0:headbut 0:ting 
 the idea of the game was to see how hard you could hit your head on the ceiling of the 
 bunker which had gradually 0:gradu 0:ally settled to a mere 5 feet 4 inches while remaining conscious 0:con 0:scious to 
 tell about it the ceiling took a lot of punishment from lt turco who became quite proficient at it but 
 the title eventually went to company sergeant major bailey he hit his head so hard on one try that the 
 medics had to be called in to referee eventually the bunker was declared a hard hat area putting an end 
 to the game but leaving the hq staff with a lot of dented helmets having been outdone headbutting 0:head 0:butting 
 by the csm lt turco had to find a new source of notoriety his quest ended during one stand to 
 which found him running down a outline to his trench and colliding 0:collid 0:ing with lcol kennedy according to the 
 co mr turco was running wildly his parka half off mukluks in hand and rifle dragging along behind him continued 
 
 19 give me hack the hall broom i 100 regimental day a highlight of the exercise was the live fire 
 night defensive 0:defen 0:sive shoot although it was very cold it was excellent practice 0:prac 0:tice in night shooting and 
 fire control plentiful ammunition ensured that all ranks enjoyed themselves the tank stalking 0:stalk 0:ing range taught many people of 
 all ranks important lessons on the use of ground the exercise was a great success the first battalion proved capable 
 of operating effectively in extremes of climate 0:cli 0:mate that normally one would want to avoid after nordic strike the 
 battalion went on standby during 0:dur 0:ing the calgary olympics fortunately nothing untoward happened combat support company was however inspected 
 by several dignitaries such as comd air command 0:com 0:mand and comd fmc a busy primary combat function course period 
 followed 0:fol 0:lowed and then we prepared for waincon 88 waincon 88 by capt d r e bugeaud on 16 
 april the battalion deployed to wainwright for a month of intensive training we started with the basics teams and sections 
 in the attack while this was going on everyone not in a rifle section was busy setting up a variety 
 of live fire ranges first all sections went through three ranges an attack on a prepared position an advance in 
 open country and advancing in close country using small arms weapons effects simulators sawes combat support 0:sup 0:port company spent 
 this time building a platoon and a company 0:com 0:pany level range all members thoroughly enjoyed these ranges and all 
 went through without mishap the only problem 0:prob 0:lem was a series of fires at the combat support company ranges 
 but these merely changed their close country range to an open country range members of a coy dismount on the 
 live fire section attack range the annual avgp swim test had a new twist this year it took the form 
 of an assault water crossing across border lake to attack patricia hill rehearsals took place in a small swampy foul 
 smelling pond so everyone looked forward to the clean water of border lake the companies took turns at this and 
 it proved to be successful all vehicles that attempted to cross did so although some drivers and crew commanders were 
 somewhat nervous as their carriers settled 0:set 0:tled down to the turret ring in the middle of the lake finally 
 the battalion prepared for and deployed on the brigade exercise 0:exer 0:cise covering all phases of war we had the 
 benefit of heavy equipment from icer to help us dig in our avgp s and to cross obstacles this cut 
 down tremendously on problems that arose and was greatly appreciated capt ferguson s heart is still pumping rapidly after his 
 close call with a cougar 0:cou 0:gar he was in an litis finally we packed up and headed back to 
 calgary to prepare for exercise prairie viper in suff ield of special note was the reputation earned by 4 platoon 
 0:pla 0:toon everywhere we went a fire broke out even when we were only observers we now qualify as smoky 
 the bear fire fighters and area c is no longer plagued by excessive undergrowth which way to the beach b 
 coy prepares for the assault river crossing will this fit on my pistol maj mckeown dco takes aim with the 
 saws equipment after waincon the battalion rushed to repair anything that needed it and to prepare for suffield s live 
 fire battle group exercise prairie viper 88 many of our avgp s remained in calgary due to a shortage of 
 shocks and af 0:a 0:f rames this was to cause problems later as the training area in suffield destroys both 
 these parts 2lt reeves has provided us with a colourful description of the exercise 
 20 ex prairie viper 88 by 2lt c w reeves on 18 may 1988 the first battalion loaded onto its 
 high speed combat air conditioned buses and deployed to beautiful cfb suffield for the 1 cbg battle group exercise prairie 
 viper 88 upon arrival in this desert training area the battalion 0:battal 0:ion commenced setting up its bivouac area and 
 began final preparations for the training that was to take place in the next ten days since this was to 
 be a completely live fire battle group level exercise commanders had to attend numerous safety briefings before any of the 
 fun could start these briefings 0:brief 0:ings also provided the opportunity for our officers to meet the officers of the 
 other combat arms involved in the exercise 0:exer 0:cise while these briefings were taking place the soldiers zeroed their weapons 
 and prepared vehicles and equipment 0:equip 0:ment in their spare time however many soldiers decided to acquaint themselves with some 
 of the local prairie dogs and began working on their tans for summer finally the morning came when the training 
 would officially 0:offi 0:cially begin in clouds of dust the companies rolled off to their assigned training areas after linking 
 up with the safety staff the companies began their advance to contact it did not take long before the first 
 rounds were fired down range at the vicious enemy figure 11 and plywood targets commanders 0:com 0:manders right down to 
 section level quickly relearned the importance of command and control in order to ensure that our own soldiers were not 
 hurt by friendly fire the soldiers relearned the importance of taking well aimed shots as opposed to firing blindly reorg 
 members of a coy reorg after a successful attack as time went on platoons and companies improved their minor tactics 
 fieldcraft and fire fighting techniques given the recent drought and type of terrain every attack ignited a grass fire that 
 added a bit more realism to the training 0:train 0:ing these fires caused by artillery mortar tank and company 0:com 
 0:pany weapons fire had to be extinguished after every attack before anyone could continue with the trace after these initial 
 gruelling days in the heat and dust the battalion returned to the bivouac area for a day of rest and 
 maintenance which began with a night off in medicine hat for those who were interested the following day while soldiers 
 and ncos worked on maintenance and reallocation 0:realloca 0:tion of equipment and vehicles the officers were off reconnoitering 0:recon 0:noitering

 returned to the field to carry on with its training even fewer avgps were serviceable 0:servicea 0:ble b company always 
 wanting to be different conducted mounted operations in m lvws for the remainder of the exercise 0:exer 0:cise these last 
 few days of the exercise involved battle group level defensive and offensive operations overall all ranks gained valuable experience and 
 learned numerous lessons that will be applied in the future 7 hope the sergeant doesn 7 hear about this c 
 coys new dismounting drills the battalion returned home on 30 may 1988 as a much more cohesive unit it had 
 learned to adapt improvise and overcome many problems such as logistics and the loss of commanders that could very well 
 surface in a time of war commanders got to know their jobs and men better and soldiers had gained more 
 confidence and proficiency with their weapons as a final note capt be lewis 2ic c company had managed to get 
 a great suntan all in all an excellent exercise immediately after suffield everyone prepared for the wide variety of taskings 
 lined up for the summer with the rest of the brigade s major units either going overseas or returning from 
 overseas we bore the brunt of the brigade s responsibilities we provided personnel for milcon nrqs the brigade small arms 
 competition courses in wainwright gagetown borden and many other places too numerous to mention bn small arms teams and bde 
 competition by lt welsh and capt emck the shooting teams of 1 ppcli had another fine year in 1988 the 
 shooting skills of the battalion were well represented by teams in the following categories pistol smg service rifle lmg and 
 sniper rifle continued 
 21 the brigade small arms competition was held in calgary 0:cal 0:gary in june responsibility for the running of the 
 competition 0:competi 0:tion fell to the officers and soldiers of b coy and cbt sp coy in fact there were 
 many more soldiers from 1 ppcli involved in administration than in the shooting itself although the competition only took a 
 week the preparation required was considerable capt ramsbotham royal green jackets was the oic with csm jackson doing much of 
 the necessary ground work the range staff and butt party spent a relatively tedious 0:tedi 0:ous but necessary week before 
 the competition rehearsing 0:rehears 0:ing the routine targets up targets down rang through the butts as capt bugeaud wo burke 
 and the remainder of the butt party practised their black art oic butts found to his amazement that using golf 
 tees as target plugs worked very well thanks sgt bishop many firing point staff worked under their beach umbrellas at 
 the other end of the range these included capt the plug justice and lt random number generator johnson their efforts 
 and those of all their staff contributed to a very well run week of competition in addition to running the 
 competition the battalion had its own competitors the first to shoot was the pistol team led by mcpl osteshower and 
 sgt richie other members were cpl carrol pte ho and pte macdonald the team placed second but pte ho finished 
 as the best individual in the brigade forget the grouping check out that chick from svc bn freeze gopher mcpl

 pte middleton pte cave pte edwards pte mcgrath and pte macdonald this team was given a bye to the national 
 competition at the connaught 0:con 0:naught ranges in ottawa but unfortunately did not win there the service rifle team had 
 a confusing preparation period after switching several times between the c 1 and c 7 a decision was made just 
 prior to the brigade competition 0:competi 0:tion that for the first time the c 7 rifle would be used the 
 rifle team members included sgt hitchcock mcpl litle pte davis pte kenyon ptestratton and pte liddicoat the rifle team was 
 also given a bye to the main event in ottawa where sgt hitchcock placed in the top 50 while the 
 team placed second in the four man team competition for the daigle trophy 0:tro 0:phy as the team members were 
 all first year shooters or tyros while many other teams had three seniors and only one tyro this was an 
 extremely creditable result the battalion 1988 sniper teams consisted of capt oliphant mcpl wheatly mcpl ostershower and cpl carroll 0:car

 1988 that they have the ability and the skills to be among the best marksmen in the army it remains 
 to be seen whether 1989 will provide the battalion the opportunity of doing even better nrqs by lt j m 
 shorten the summer of 88 proved to be a busy one for the soldiers 0:sold 0:iers of 1 ppcli a 
 direct result of being the only ones in the right place at the right time several taskings required many individuals 
 to perform duties in various areas of the country 0:coun 0:try in the case of charlie company we were destined 
 to return to our old stomping grounds of wainwright alberta to assist our brothers in the reserves we were to 
 provide the manpower vehicles and expertise 0:exper 0:tise for what is commonly called nrqs or the national ranks qualification school 
 more specifically we became the backbone for a course that would end up qualifying militia 0:mili 0:tia officers as either 
 infantry company commanders or armoured squadron commanders this became a task that charlie company soon realized would take some added 
 patience on its part t 
 22 on around 4 july 88 c coy mounted up in what few avgps were left in the brigade and 
 headed north for what proved to be a memorable two weeks a couple of days prior militia officers from quebec 
 to b c were gathered in wainwright 0:wain 0:wright attending lectures that would soon be put into practice piauuuw our 
 first two days were spent practicing for a company level deliberate attack and a time and space demonstration on the 
 open prairie west of the battle river the performance went off without a hitch while the candidates observed from a 
 higher vantage point time was then spent familiarizing them with our vehicles and equipment with which some had no previous 
 experience soon the candidates assumed command roles and we were off and running the officer candidates rapidly became familiarized with 
 the art of navigating from a moving grizzly particularly in the badlands 0:bad 0:lands they learned about the realities of 
 command and control 0:con 0:trol at company and platoon level by the best method experience things got very hot at 
 times during nrqs as the course progressed charlie company received valuable training time in offensive defensive and delay operations 0:oper 
 0:ations each day s activities culminated with the adoption of an administrative harbor the canteen produced a welcome 0:wel 0:come 
 relaxed social atmosphere where one could reflect on he day s activities and get to know the militiamen better and 
 they took a keen interest in all that we had to say as assessment after assessment was completed we found 
 ourselves approaching the end of the course and headed back to camp in appreciation of our efforts the candidates 0:can 
 0:didates hosted a party at the buffalo lodge where more than sufficient quantities of food beer and entertainment could be 
 found avcts from c coy form up in extended line at nrqs all in all the experience was positive and 
 it pointed out the need for more cooperation and training amongst the reserves and regular forces to help celebrate the 
 75th anniversary the first battalion 0:battal 0:ion has provided a team of mountain climbing experts tc conquer four mountains bearing 
 names of famous patricias what follows is the story of the trip up the first such mountain 0:moun 0:tain mount 
 corbould in b c ex corbould patricia 1 capt r migadel to mark the 75th anniversary of the regiment 1 
 ppcli will replace the 50th jubilee canister in the cairn on top of mount hamilton gault and present the contents 
 to the regimental museum we will leave a new canister to practice 0:prac 0:tice the battalion team we decided to 
 climb three other mountains named after distinguished former members of the regiment the four mountains we selected were mount hamilton 
 gault mount buller mount farquhar and the recently renamed mount corbould mount corbould was the first climb the battalion s 
 75th anniversary climbing team we were forced to do our initial 0:ini 0:tial planning with only a limited recce and 
 poor air photos the photos were taken in the early spring however with a detailed map recce the plan soon 
 fell into place the plan was simple we were to follow a logging road to the east side of the 
 mountain and then make our way up an intermittent creek bed to its origin next we had to bash through 
 the bush to a main ridge line and once on it follow it until we were clear of the wood 
 line finally we had to traverse the slope to the saw ridge where the peak of mount corbould was waiting 
 to be conquered mcpl denkowycz team 2 second ascent the climbing team was dropped off at around 0900 hrs on 
 1 sep 88 at the base of the mountain on the logging road following the dry creek bed up to 
 the ridge line and made good progress over the large boulders however the route turned out to be harder than 
 we estimated our route ended abruptly in thick undergrowth but fortunately we had gained about 1500 ft elevation continued 
 23 the next phase of the operation saw us hacking through the bush to the ridge line instead of the 
 usual cloud cover we had a beautiful sunny sky with a record breaking 32 degrees celsius this plus the heavy 
 undergrowth and lack of water lead to us becoming quite drained and dehydration 0:dehydra 0:tion became a pressing concern around 
 1930 hrs a decision 0:deci 0:sion to bivouac was made and a recce team was sent to locate a water 
 re supply point while we still had some daylight 0:day 0:light we had our first bivouac camp ready just after 
 2200 hrs with a 13 hour day and only 4000 ft elevation gam we decided on a late start for 
 the next day since we were finally clear of the wood line much to our surprise we awoke early and 
 had a leisurely breakfast afterwards we packed up and started up the mountain again around 1000 hrs we came upon 
 a glacial pond at about the 6000 ft level if a person ever wished to come across a mountain oasis 
 we found it with this mountain 0:moun 0:tain oasis as our base camp we felt we could travel quickly with 
 light packs to the peak since it was less than 2 km away mcpl gauvreau in a chimney however our 
 luck was to change once more our intended route came to an abrupt halt because the ridge line became a 
 300 ft cliff since we were unable to negotiate 0:negoti 0:ate this obstacle we tactically withdrew back to the tweedmuir 
 0:tweed 0:muir lodge to reevaluate our attack plan our gruelling 15 hr approach was equally matched with a demanding 9 
 hr descent with the loss of three days the plan now was to assault the mountain by two separate routes 
 with the support staff establishing a radio rebroadcasting station rrb on a nearby peak the rrb played a major role 
 in the helicopter evacuation of mcpl denkowycz who was injured when a rock was dislodged and crushed hisfoot just following 
 the hel evac a weather front moved in and left the remaining two members of the rope team 2 in 
 a white out for 36 hrs while rope team 2 was caught in the white out rope team 1 had 
 to slag upwards in heavy rain to establish a high camp the purpose of a high camp is to wait 
 in position for the weather to clear prior to making a summit push with this information and the fact that 
 rope team 2 had only two members left and still over 5 km to go to reach the peak we 
 made the decision to turn back the second rope team picked up the support staff who manned the rrb and 
 proceeded back to tweedmuir lodge on wednesday 7 sep 88 sgt graham s rope team awoke to sunny skies they 
 decide to make the push by following 0:fol 0:lowing the glacier to a snow chute to gain the ridge line 
 however 0:how 0:ever they had to place a few pitons for protection prior to completing the final 300 ft to 
 the ridge line once on the ridge line it was only another 500 ft until they reached the peak but 
 it wasn t the highest peak the next peak over was at 1530 hrs the mountain was conquered ml corbould 
 the way to the top team 2 on the peak of mt corbould with the regimental flag after a quick 
 photo and constructing a cairn the rope team headed back to their high camp for a night s rest on 
 thursday after an 11 hr descent they were picked up by the support staff and taken back to tweedsmuir lodge 
 mcpl denkowycz suffered no broken bones or permanent 0:perma 0:nent injury to his foot but he had to walk with 
 crutches for three weeks the climbing team gained valuable experience learning 0:learn 0:ing much about themselves and their teammates while 
 climbing in unfamiliar terrain next we will climb mounts buller and farquhar as conditioning 0:con 0:ditioning and warm up climbs 
 prior to the conquest of the real prize mount hamilton gault after a hectic summer the battalion deployed to dundurn 
 0:dun 0:durn saskatchewan for a patrolling battle school a very rewarding exercise exercise noble patricia 1 ppcli fall battle school 
 by lt j p decoste during the last two week of september the first battalion 0:battal 0:ion deployed to dundurn 
 for an intense battle school the battle school began in typical fashion with rifle sections and platoons reacquainting themselves with 
 skill dulled through life in garrison simultaneously the platoons of combat support 0:sup 0:port company were actively preparing what would 
 have to be called some of the most demanding and exciting ranges to meet and test a soldier s abilities 
 while range staff busied themselves with the construction 0:construc 0:tion of trenches tunnels and bunkers rifle company per continued 
 24 sonnel filled their days with a myriad of tasks sawes were incorporated into section and platoon training which helped 
 to reinforce skills and drills the arduous attacks were compounded 0:com 0:pounded by the difficulty of navigation well as command 
 and control over the pockmarked terrain of the dundurn training area which is not unlike the surface of the moon 
 these first few days hardened muscle and harmonized drills the next few days saw platoons moving from range to range 
 these ranges were designed to test the individual the team and section as well as that most important fighting 0:fight 
 0:ing entity the rifle platoon soldiers were challenged with an individual close quarter 0:quar 0:ter battle run cqbr commonly referred 
 to as a jungle lane this differed from the norm in that it was conducted with a 12 gauge shotgun 
 verses a c 7 cries of bird and oull echoed throughout the bush there is nothing novel about using shotguns 
 in battle shotguns have been used in all major wars and conflicts from the trenches of wwi to the jungles 
 of malaysia and vietnam moreover shotgun shooting is an excellent means of improving hand eye coordination 0:coor 0:dination aiding immeasurably 
 in the quick kill technique of shooting this ain t no turkey shoot the instinctive shooting range dundurn saskatchewan natural 
 orogression had soldiers paired conducting team fire and movement over a well prepared range constructed 0:con 0:structed by mortar platoon 
 teamwork gives truth to the adage i am my brother s keeper teams rallied to their respective sections and graduated 
 0:gradu 0:ated to a section assault through dense bush this proved to be a great test of command and control 
 for this was truly a nasty position to overcome however after several sections rotated through this range it developed into 
 a scorched earth range as a result soot and cinder instead of leaves and twigs became the principal means of 
 camouflage with respect to ranges the most innovative and challenging proved to be the tunnel and bunker clearance both of 
 which were constructed by our venerable pioneers the tunnel range a darkened catacomb construction some forty five meters in length 
 was not unlike the sewers of paris or the notorious tunnels of cv chi within the iron triangle of south 
 vietnam soldiers entered the black mouth of the tunnel entrance armed with a 9mm service pistol and flashlight 0:flash 0:light 
 with only the presence of silent safety nco for reassurance 0:reas 0:surance sgt simmons the tunnel rat with sweating palms 
 and taut nerves one entered this void with the apprehension 0:apprehen 0:sion of a iost soul in hades after what 
 must have seemed to be a millennium of snaking through this winding indigo begrimed soldiers would exit with squinting eyes 
 and a smile realizing that in fact there was light at the end of the tunnel lt mills and 1 
 platoon dundurn patrol competition winners bunker clearance conducted at section level was equally as nerve wracking the darkness and difficulty 
 of this task was magnified by the blinding and choking dust stirred up by exploding grenades the intensity of training 
 was heightened by a fighting patrol competition this event saw all rifle platoons actively engaged in patrol preparations and planning 
 the course of this competition was conducted over difficult terrain laced with numerous obstacles and danger areas although few would 
 cheerfully admit it it was good patrolling weather with freezing rain and brisk winds platoons and their respective commanders were 
 assessed throughout the mission s saw each platoon conducting 0:con 0:ducting a raid on a well though somewhat deviously prepared 
 0:pre 0:pared soviet section sized position complements of reconnaissance 0:recon 0:naissance platoon recce also provided intelligence and guides after several 
 days of competition and much deliberation 0:deliber 0:ation the winning platoon wasannounced the competition waswon by the men of 1 
 platoon a company commanded by lt j mills and sgt d warrington the battle school culminated in a march and 
 shoot competition this incorporated hard marching and equally difficult navigation over featureless rolling hills as well personnel 0:per 0:sonnel were 
 tested in first aid and shooting while wearing gas masks 7 platoon c company commanded by lt m annis and

 25 after ten hard long days the first battalion returned to currie barracks it had been a good exercise in 
 which the soldiers were faced with some difficult problems and rather large obstacles however they prevailed the spirit and performance 
 0:per 0:formance of the soldiers of the first battalion was reflected in the exercise title noble patricia finally the battalion 
 conducted another pcf course cycle and started preparation for next year s winter exercise we enjoyed the men s christmas

 night burritos and takeout pizza a land of pickup trucks baseball hats and screaming guitar 0:gui 0:tar solos a land 
 where you will be chilled by the winter wind then warmed by the affections of its mysterious swarthy women and 
 so they moved they left behind them the tribal euro thump of the tanzhaustrinkplatziscos 0:tan 0:zhaustrinkplatziscos they left behind them 
 the yellow high beams plaid pants and stores that close at noon on saturday 0:satur 0:day they left the goatee 
 beards the round glasses and most importantly they left those disgusting oily slimy salads with shredded beets in them and 
 it was good and yea verily they moved all manner of possessions with them the shepherds took their flocks of 
 saab and jetta they took with them the stereos and videos and televisions the skis and bicycles the computers and 
 antiques and there was much anguish and wringing of hands as the mad search for receipts took place and there 
 was much gnashing of teeth when they went through customs and it was bad and to the rotation office they 
 flocked 1221 members and dependents 133 pets 245 cars 48 motorcycles and 1 371 989 lbs of unaccompanied baggage with 
 complaints and arguments problems and technicalities the love sick brought their newly beloveds with vows they could not leave them 
 behind in this savage land so matrimony must be theirs the malcontents swore they would not go and searched for 
 alternate destinations the hurried sought to leave this place sooner and the slow sought to delay departure 0:depar 0:ture and 
 it was confused and so the men they called 2 ppcli labored to complete 0:com 0:plete the pilgrimage back home 
 replaced in their foreign home by a tribe of directionless godless heathens and as they packed and shipped catalogued and 
 searched listed paraded and accounted for a question occurred to all will we have to do this every four years 
 special note a special thank you goes out to all those who made the rotation so much easier without the

 a brief ceremony at holden war cemetery commemorating our fallen comrades 0:com 0:rades after placing the canadian flag at each 
 grave we welcomed 0:wel 0:comed a contingent of dutch children who had arrived unaware of our plans and requested permission 
 to share in our act of remembrance their reaction was typical of what all patricias have encountered in the netherlands 
 during our tour the dutch who suffered so much during wwii still grieve over our fallen servicemen a canadian soldier 
 is always well received in holland an important aspect on ventures such as these is the opportunity afforded to meet 
 new people experience another culture and generally broaden one s horizons our trip was quite eventful in this respect tours

 over the period 9 19 september it was the company s first exercise since returning from europe and it was 
 the first dismounted training in quite some time more importantly it was the first opportunity for the company s three 
 new platoon commanders 0:com 0:manders all eager graduates from the most recent phase iv in gagetown to go to the 
 field with their new platoons after some unexpected but nonetheless well handled cross loading of busses on deployment the company 
 arrived in sandy dundurn ready for a week s training in section 0:sec 0:tion and platoon offensive operations the platoon 
 commanders 0:com 0:manders were given relatively free rein by the company commander major k a moher to conduct training as 
 they saw fit showing some measure of collaboration or coincidence 0:coinci 0:dence they all completed physically demanding advancesto contact 0:advances 
 0:to 0:contact and quick attacks by day with navigation patrol ling and stalking exercises by night the training culminated in 
 two section level live fire exercises 0:exer 0:cises the first conducted by sergeant s hart was a tank hunting practice 
 which incorporated the m 72 and carl gustav antitank weapons and the new c 6 gpmg the second 0:sec 0:ond 
 conducted by warrant officer l v j surridge was a section advance to contact supported by the platoon light mortar 
 and gpmg both exercises challenged the sections and ably rounded out their training while the soldiers and their leaders were 
 certainly put through their paces the exercise nicknamed meteor rage was not all hard work bravo company upheld its long 
 standing sop of work hard play hard first there was a combat football game where it seemed at times that 
 the platoon commanders were taking on the world second there were the recreation runs into nearby saskatoon as time permitted

 31 wainwright revisited there were a few things we were looking forward to upon return to canada but a deployment 
 to wainwright wasn t high on the list c company journeyed there on the heels of their post embarkation leave 
 from germany to prepare 0:pre 0:pare for exercise medicine man vii in suffield the company 0:com 0:pany took to the 
 road by bus on 18 september 1988 and completed work ups on 4 october a lot of things had changed 
 in the four years the battalion had been absent in cfe a few people were disappointed to find most of 
 the observation towers gone and navigation by map necessary once again several others found out that a right turn at 
 the wrong spot got you to the mott lake campgrounds and yes its still out of bounds to tracked vehicles 
 some things haven t changed though and our return to wainwright quickly familiarized everyone to the special aspects of soldiering 
 in canada no gasthofs for brotchen at breakfast no barns or houses to sleep in or use as a command 
 0:com 0:mand post tactical movement was permitted and there were no natives complaining about panzers the battle river posed the 
 usual problems to movement and the wild pigs were replaced by only slightly less wild cattle and a few crazed 
 oil men the oil rigs make very convincing missile sites and would be ideal targets for raids and attacks if 
 only they weren t out of bounds too c company conducted eight days of dry training concentrating 0:con 0:centrating on 
 offensive operations and finishing with a fast paced three day exercise that practiced hasty and deliberate 0:deliber 0:ate defence patrolling 
 hasty and deliberate attacks and the advance and withdraw we capped our return to wainwright with days of live field 
 firing to practice fire and movement and fighting through the objective we made maximum use of this time to confirm 
 our expertise on our anti armour and crew served weapons after the mandatory company smoker and having done our share 
 to prop up the wainwright economy we set off on the trail south to suffield stay tuned same batco station

 british army training unit suffield batus exercise medicine man vii the company began medman vii with a six day period 
 of special to arm training this training had two goals the first was to let us get used to live 
 fire exercises and the second 0:sec 0:ond was to let the safety staff assure themselves that we were competent with 
 our weapons and equipment these exercises 0:exer 0:cises included muskrat where each rifle section rotated through three stands to participate 
 in bunker busting with m 72s and grenades the defence and a battle inoculation range we also went through several 
 small exercises called bald eagle porcupine and burrowing owl all designed to progressively involve all members of the group in 
 tests of increasing difficulty there were more enemy more bmps and deeper objectives to clear we learned that we were 
 faster than the tanks and our apcs more reliable thanks to our mrt crew the special to arm phase ended 
 with ex beaver which evolved from and assault water crossing due to lack of water in the south saskatchewan river 
 into a dismounted battle group attack preceded by a 12 kilometer 0:kilome 0:ter approach march we carried the mortar platoon 
 s bombs for them and cleaned up a large objective at dawn to complete 0:com 0:plete the exercise the company 
 then joined the rest of the battle group to go through two short exercises called gopher and goshawk 0:gos 0:hawk 
 our ability to move quickly in our mll3s was well known by this time and the company was frequently tasked 
 with additional responsibilities as the battle group reserve its rare that the infantry holds such an important role in an 
 armour heavy organization we saw and experienced a lot during these activities we saw bangalore torpedoes fired the giant viper 
 minefield breaching system was used and milan antitank missiles were launched after a half day of maintenance we launched into 
 the final exercise appropriately 0:appropri 0:ately named alamein with about 30 minutes notice the company started out defending a bridge 
 across the suffield river in the village of daytona 7 platoon formed the demolition guard and our pioneer section and 
 m fc party were instrumental in the success of the defence following the withdraw of friendly forces across the bridge 
 and the launching of anti heliborne force they met on the bridge the demolition was fired and the company fell 
 back into its primary positions to defeat the hordes as they attempted to cross the river eight platoon was dispatched 
 twice to help out the other infantry company from the scots guards after two nights in the defence we withdrew 
 into reserve only to be inserted once again into the defence to relieve another battered company we fought a long 
 night battle and our 50 cal s once again saved the day their distinctive sound and tracer are great for 
 the morale of those on the right side of the gun with a day left to go the company conducted 
 a long night move that saw the prairie at its worst the land was flat and featureless with heavy dust 
 storms to cause delays of up to three hours even in these circumstances though we learned we learned that an 
 apc is the master key to any gate we learned that there is still oil in alberta we were there 
 and we learned to rely on our own navigation following 0:fol 0:lowing the night move we attacked two steeply rising 
 features 0:fea 0:tures called linklater and x 7 the pioneer section probed through 150 meteres of minefield to allow the

 ourselves with the new weapons the ranges went well the px was crowded and as usual the kit shop ran 
 out of poncho liners next stop was the wildflecken training area where the platoon was to carry out the pwt 
 and get in a bit of tent routine unusually harsh winter conditions made for very realistic and challenging 0:challeng 0:ing 
 firing with heavy winds and blowing snow targets were almost impossible to see there were no shortage of ranges for 
 us however as the americans and the germans could not believe that anyone would be out in that weather when 
 things got too hairy changes had to be made and an evening 0:eve 0:ning had to be spent in town 
 coincidentally it was dirty thursday the highlight of fasching and a great time was had by all march saw the 
 pcf cycle and recce platoon had a number of people on the track course the course started with us driving 
 through local towns and along the rhine later we went to soltau for tactical driving and some crosstraining 0:cross 0:training

 set sail with 4th canadian destroyer squadron for barkley sound as part of the enemy orange force during marpac s 
 exercise 0:exer 0:cise orange grove the company was to conduct an amphibious operation to seek out and destroy the forces 
 of blue land the mission was relatively simple deploy four observation 0:obser 0:vation posts on designated islands in barkley sound 
 in order to obtain a fix on the enemy ships anchored there these locations would in turn be relayed to 
 the orange force ships phase 1 of the operation was the deployment of b company by three ships from desron 
 four hmcs yukon hmcs saskatchewan and hmcs mackenzie maj m j english 0:eng 0:lish officer commanding b company remained aboard 
 hmcs yukon in order to liaise with the navy while capt j j m lesalle commanded the troops on the 
 ground the initial deployment phase proved to be most treacherous and capt lasalle was only too happy to leave the 
 heads and paddle ashore with a chuckling lt naval mark hadley who discovered that those scenic and hilly islands only 
 look beautiful 0:beau 0:tiful from afar continued loading of assault boats 
 41 with the amphibious landing complete the next task at hand was to establish observation posts and carry out the 
 surveillance task undeniably a fair amount of rack time was snagged by all however that was little consolation for the 
 continuous downpour that ensued early 18 nov 88 the first of the enemy ships was spotted and it was only 
 a short time before all of the ships were plotted on the map and a fire mission was prepared actually 
 the fire mission remained prepared for quite a while since the company was not able to relay it on to 
 the ships because communications were well not the best when 19 nov 88 rolled around hmcs mackenzie retrieved the b 
 company landing party and the troops were hospitably greeted and treated to a shot glass full of cheer that would 
 have made clint eastwood s eyes water there was time to relax and chow down but not for long soon

 the fall pcf cycle from 26 oct to 8 dec 88 the two serials conducted 0:con 0:ducted simultaneously were unique 
 because it was the first time that the use of the c 6 has been formally taught within the battalion 
 unlike past mg courses candidates received formal instruction on three weapons instead of two including the use of the ground 
 mount vehicle mount and antiaircraft mount twenty days were devoted to dry training which included theory and characteristics of mg 
 fire weapons handling use of the avgp turret and all arms air defence the course then deployed to yakima firing 
 center washington 0:washing 0:ton for eight days of live firing in yakima the candidates reacted to fire control orders practiced 
 individual weapon drills and visually observed the characteristics of live mg fire the highlight of the course however was the 
 anti aircraft shooting the course was successful in shooting down a total of nine out of twenty drones flown by 
 members of the united states army s first battalion 44th air defence artillery from fort lewis washington 3 ppcli no

 you fly you die beard growing patricia style by pte d j pickett pioneer course 8801 started out very much 
 the same as any other course good morning i m your instructor this is what you will be learning once 
 it started we learned more than expected we learned how to use pioneer tools both old and new build bridges 
 of rope and logs set up booby traps lay mines and build boats from some of the wildest things you 
 ve ever seen and of course we all enjoyed doing demolitions this was one of the first courses to work 
 with the new hydraulic power tools these tools make the job ten times easier and give pioneers a new capability 
 finally out of the classroom the first tool learned was the power saw like all courses some knew how to 
 use it and some didn t we won t mention any names like pte linday s after learning how to 
 use all the tools the next step was to go to camp thunderbird and build something we built a bridge 
 of round timber and top of the line culvert cont carrying one of the logs to bridge site to become 
 a road barrier 
 42 after the building phase it was off to the much fought over highly tactical sports field to set up 
 wire obstacles it even rained how realistic booby traps were the next item it was a lot of fun for 
 those that didn t get killed unfortunately we suffered heavy losses in the finding and disarming of them just ask 
 pte dunkin then we were taught how to care for and maintain rope roll it up this way don t 
 hang it on betel and don t step on it as mentioned earlier the sports field had been fortified however 
 it was not strong enough we had to go back and lay amine field the enemy never did show up 
 so we decided to breech it ourselves the course was progressing very well so we invited the general to come 
 out with us for a cruise around the dock in our 15 man assault boats he was impressed afterwards between 
 sections war broke out and all got wet thanks to mcpl breustedt after splashing around it was time to go 
 to chilliwack for some hard core pioneer work watermanship was first the boats were made from no more than what 
 you would have on patrol we were very limited in the training we could do on slesse demolition range because

 1988 ran from 26 oct to 7 dec the course was conducted in three phases the first phase was spent 
 learning to drive in the city and surrounding 0:sur 0:rounding area of victoria impressing the heck out of the girls 
 and scaring the dickens out of the local drivers who were unaccustomed to 12 tons of bear on the road 
 amazingly we came through it all without even a scratch on the paint military or civilian however the instructors are 
 a little grayer around the temples and now have strange far away looks in their eyes the second phase of 
 the course was the swim camp at lake cowichan many of the students didn t believe that 12 tons of 
 steel would float but before the day was over they were firm believers in the swimming abilities of the grizzl 
 many thanks to po constantine and his drivers from fleet diving unit pacific for their help in running a successful 
 swim camp full steam ahead crew commander mcpl jure driver pte officer the third phase of the course was the 
 training conducted 0:con 0:ducted at yakima firing centre washington the road move down to yakima was uneventful i can t 
 figure out why the american drivers gave us two lanes to ourselves on interstate 0:inter 0:state 5 though the training 
 down in yakima consisted of hides harbors night driving leaguers and reviewing driving 0:driv 0:ing strategies in the desert inn 
 thanks to all the instructors for making this course an outstanding success and helping me maintain my sanity until the 
 next bunch of eager young candidates arrive on the scene the tubes by lt p a weir after having been 
 disbanded last february to enhance the effectiveness of the rest of the battalion the tubes were once again reunited on 
 their home turf to reform the elite fighting force of the unit under the able leadership of apt perry iron

 dec although many aspects of the training are of course still classified there were 17 successful graduates who are now 
 permitted to wear the distinguished tubes shoulder flash during the course training was conducted in a host of strange exotic

 to the battalion s cyprus tour the platoon did not fire the year s allotment of tow missiles although missiles

 there is always a demand for qualified drivers in the infantry the responsibility for driver training in 88 fell upon 
 the broad and slightly bruised shoulders 0:shoul 0:ders of battalion transport platoon the most overworked and underpaid but that s 
 another story 3 ppcli transport ran two driver wheeled courses in 1988 course 8801 in aug sep commanded by lt

 both graduated 28 candidates the 8801 top candidate was pte now mcpl kilmury and top honours for gumball rally 8802 
 went to cpl rekrut despite our sterling reputation nobody is perfect course 8802 had its share of noteworthy scrapes to 
 avoid embarrassment and possible legal action the names of the villains in the following stories have been withheld the first 
 tale involves a mlvw being driven in the mary hill training area the accompanying photo pretty well says it all 
 of course nearly everyone has gotten a truck stuck at some point in their careers but for an entire weekend 
 driver wheeled course 8802 ptes peterson and ferris practice some driver maintenance on an mlvw then there is the story

 swerved to avoid the little critter 0:crit 0:ter and noticed i was now heading for a drainage ditch i swerved 
 again and the vehicle rolled over onto its side no one was hurt and the litis once righted could still

 was given a map and traces of the traditional red and blue forces skirmishes were few and far between at 
 the outset but on the morning of the last day the ds activated a few secret weapons and the blue 
 army was soon transformed into a few tombstones here and there throughout the feba on the last evening there was

 indeed could walk the rice paper without causing a rip at albert head cadet camp during the first four weeks 
 basic subjects and physical and spiritual superiority were taught and thoroughly practiced the requirement for all infanteers to master the

 was initially made by captains ted moeller padre p and paul hale 2ic adm coy lcol elliott who had been 
 involved with the installation of the first window in february 1983 enthusiastically supported the idea and directed that it be 
 completed as soon as possible after an active search of cyprus john and katie welch of limassol were approached at 
 the beginning of july and asked if they could produce a window for the chapel mr welch had never constructed 
 church window before but he eagerly accepted the challenge using sketches and ideas proposed by capt moeller and hale a 
 final design was quickly agreed upon and in three weeks john welch produced an outstanding example of his craftsmanship continued 
 
 45 the center piece of the window depicts the resurrection 0:resurrec 0:tion of christ it is meant to represent christ 
 triumphing over the blackness of death as he strides toward the viewer with this arms upraised in victory and benediction 
 two of the side panels of the window consist of a series of small rectangular 0:rec 0:tangular shades of un

 regiment was founded by a man who cared deeply about his fellow man andrew hamilton gault his indomitable spirit and 
 his legendary feats are well chronicled in our regimental history but he left us with a living legacy the regimental 
 family our family includes those currently wearing the uniform and those who continue to serve the regiment through their membership 
 in the ppcli association some of our sons have lost contact with the regiment and a lot of them have 
 responded to our advertising our reunion should provide a great deal of opportunities to meet fellows that you haven t 
 seen for a while celebrations to mark the 75th anniversary of our founding 0:found 0:ing are planned throughout 1989 beginning 
 on the 17th of march and ending on the 11th of november but why you might ask are we making 
 such a big deal about the 75th anniversary the answer i believe was best expressed by rod middleton president of 
 the ppcli association 1989 is in all likelihood the last opportunity that we will have to gather in one place 
 representatives from every generation of the regimental family by the time this patrician is published observances 0:obser 0:vances of our

 al the inheritors of our founder s legacy it is up to each and every one of us to ensure

 patricia s at the canadian airborne centre were very busy throughout the year cabc carried on the airborne tradition 0:tra 
 0:dition overcoming all challenges cabc continued to graduate a high standard of student 0:stu 0:dent in all of its courses 
 at the parachute training company under the command of major karl gotthardt things are running 0:run 0:ning smoothly although at 
 time we ve been overdosed on german war films and are suspicious of the secret meetings 0:meet 0:ings which include 
 capt schmidt and capt witt the patricia s posted into cabc this summer include major gotthardt 0:got 0:thardt captvida capt 
 haverstock sgt taylor sgt maxwell sgt meier sgt estey and sgt mclean everyone has settled 0:set 0:tled down to the

 basic para serial we had the opportunity to sharpen up our hunting skills and were offered the opportunity 0:oppor 0:tunity 
 to conduct a parachute instructor symposium weapons training in 1988 progressed smoothly even though for some it was their first 
 use of the c 7 nevertheless 0:neverthe 0:less the majority of people at cabc managed to score marksman with the

 retire capt witt was officially dined out in october 1988 he took advantage 0:advan 0:tage of this opportunity to pass 
 on lessons learned over his long period of service his advice and experience will be missed by all ranks once 
 he retires for good in april 1989 we at cabc and i assume we speak for all ranks in the 
 patricias wish ed and janet an enjoyable retirement in bc as for the sky hawks they continue to do the 
 military proud with their parachuting demonstrations however it would make things easier for the rest of us if we didn 
 t have to listen to these poor individuals tell of all the hardships they suffered in australia in conclusion 1988 
 was busy yet enjoyable and rewarding the patricias at cabc look forward to 1989 and the 75th anniversary and many 
 here plan to make the pilgrimage 0:pil 0:grimage to calgary to rekindle old friendships and join in the celebrations airborne 
 2 commando diary 1988 as usual 2 commando experienced an eventful year which covered everything from good old airborne operations 
 0:opera 0:tions to practising possible dco scenarios through to security 0:secu 0:rity for the economic summit in toronto the following 
 are a few excerpts from the unit diary capt witt tests new freefall equipment maintaining vigilance at the economic summit 
 in toronto jan mar the new year was heralded in with yet another warning order and on 11 january preparation 
 for ex lightning 0:light 0:ning strike began in earnest this was going to be a formation 0:for 0:mation test exercise 
 for the special service force in defence of canada operations as the battle for northern canada developed the canadian 0:cana 
 0:dian airborne regiment deployed to edmonton for tasks in the western arctic it was here on 24 january that 2 
 cdo received detailed orders for a para assault to recapture inuvik 0:inu 0:vik airfield the mood was well established under 
 situation met wind chill factor was seasonally average 0:aver 0:age at 83 c 2 cdo prepared for the worst the 
 jump onto dolomite lake went well except for tpr faulds 6 platoon in the process of landing on the roof 
 of the only cabin within 20km he sheered off the tv antenna and his rucksack went through the front door 
 much to everyone s 0:every 0:one 0:s surprise the owner was ecstatic and overjoyed with all the excitement the seizing 
 of the airfield was quick yet methodical as platoons leapfrogged through the built up area e bty para was under 
 command and was employed largely in the role of infantry since indirect fire had a limited role in the mission 
 for five days 2 cdo held the perimeter of the airfield and maintained vital point guards flb fighters flew in 
 to establish their forward operating base once we were secure what we simply could not understand was why the pilots 
 and aircrew insisted on sleeping in hotels 15km away when the airfield was so well protected continued 
 48 wo charlebois and sgt hamilton hold the fort during the economic summit following ex lightning strike 2 cdo began 
 to concentrate once again on platoon level patrolling skills and live fire attack for the next two months cross country 
 skiing and overnight exercises were the routine apr as the weather gradually warmed 2 cdo began preparations for ex northern 
 strike the warning order on 8 april explained that military hostages were being held in a remote area of the 
 north bay airfield 2 cdo had the task of getting them out the mission involved a para drop long range 
 infiltration 0:infiltra 0:tion in small groups and platoon size raids to free hostages this was an exciting exercise particularly for 
 tpr wheaton he was the first member of the cdn forces to get hung up and then be successfully retrieved 
 back into the aircraft equally excited was the port stick on wheatons plane they got the green light once he 
 was back inside may jul following a well deserved break 2 cdo prepared 0:pre 0:pared for petcon 88 the entire 
 special service forces was concentrated in the petawawa training area and so range time was at a premium for 2 
 cdo most work was live fire the training began at the individual level and workups 0:work 0:ups completed in a 
 short series of commando size exercises major p g kenward hands over command of 2 commando to major d j 
 pentney concurrent activity in the canadian airborne regiment aug this month heralded the arrival of many new additions 0:addi 0:tions 
 to 2 cdo and this period is highlighted by the airborne indoctrination course aic the course consists of six days 
 of general military training all with an airborne flavour to it unarmed combat equipment rigging and demolitions are but a 
 few of the topics covered naturally the intellect works better when the body is stimulated as well so the new 
 paratroopers were subjected to plenty of running push ups chin ups and even a swim in the frigid waters of 
 the ottawa river the aic is officially ended when the regimental commander 0:com 0:mander hand an airborne coin to each 
 new member of the regiment on the parade square and a new life begins for those who receive them august 
 was also a time for old soldiers to gather in petawawa as the 20th anniversary of the airborne regiment 0:regi 
 0:ment was celebrated in grand style the attractions included a sunset ceremony by 2 cdo an outdoor tattoo for the 
 public to attend and a whole host of social functions from dances to dinners to barbecues the anniversary celebration was 
 the culminating point of many months of planning and preparation and 2 cdo certainly contributed their share to the show 
 sep this month was busy as well as the newly reorganized 0:reor 0:ganized commando shook themselves out in a series 
 of platoon 0:pla 0:toon level training exercises these exercises ranged from hostage rescue to ambushes to blowing up missile sites 
 but they all had these common characteristics well motivated troops carrying out challenging missions with uncommon speed and violence some 
 of the shine is taken off this image when we recall the long flights via cci3o hercules during which we 
 valiantly struggled to keep our last meal from coming 0:com 0:ing up again oct this month holds an annual treat 
 for 2 cdo ex burma rig this exercise involves our regimentally affiliated militia brother the loyal edmonton regiment loyal eddies 
 and the royal westminster regiment last year 2 cdo had acted as enemy force for the militia but this time 
 around we were on their side the mission was to locate picket and seize a russian radar installation which had 
 been inserted deep in the heart of camp wainwright and a night off in edmonton a zesty combination and after 
 a day of battle procedure the troops reg force and reserve alike jumped into dz rifle ridge led by an 
 2 cdo recce element 0:ele 0:ment the militia force successfully assaulted the enemy installation and captured valuable comms equipment dec 
 this is another month with special meaning for the ssf as menton days traditionally falls in this period menton is 
 a town in southern france where the ist ssf were disbanded in 1944 and the us and canadian members 0:mem 
 0:bers of those units reunite once a year this year the americans 0:ameri 0:cans flew north to visit us and 
 promptly began breaking themselves in large numbers on our dz anzio which is usually the safest dzin nato but with 
 the coming of winter 0:win 0:ter was hard and unforgiving the canadian hosts gave their guests a chance to win 
 back some respect in the local watering holes but that is an adventure for other pages the christmas wind down 
 in 2 cdo is far from mellow one day of live fire bunker assaults with grenades and m 725 followed 
 by two days of section winter skills competition and only then does the unit consider parties and festivities 
 49 the ppcli battle school by lieutenant i m bogart assistant adjutant recruit company 1988 started slowly for recruit company 
 giving no indication 0:indi 0:cation of the avalanche of recruits to follow in the second half of the year capt 
 pollock enjoyed the slow pace so much that in august he retired to leadership company where the jlc pt program 
 is more suitable for a man of his advanced years and experience the csm wo goebel also left the company

 ppcli with the exception 0:excep 0:tion of wo smith who took a yearlong detour through french language training before arriving 
 in town rumor has it that after hearing the dco speak the career manager is of the impression that english 
 is not the primary language of work at the battle school it soon became painfully obvious to all of them 
 however that the wainwright training area offered no gasthauses tanzbars or generous beer laden locals for those who have not 
 instructed observed or participated 0:par 0:ticipated in recruit training recently some interesting events have been added to the course these 
 include an 11 day final exercise a visit to a local slaughterhouse for some hands on training and the always 
 popular commanding officers rambo run the menu for the introductory exercise 0:exer 0:cise has also been changed from the standard 
 scrawny chickens to the gourmet fare of farm fattened quail or duck the officers and ncos of recruit company are 
 also given the awesome responsibility of training the first female infantry recruits despite the intense media buildup it was business 
 as usual and training continued unimpeded three mixed gender platoons with a total of 26 females commenced 0:com 0:menced training

 was considerably reduced in direct consequence 0:conse 0:quence to the lack of recruits at the battle school probably the most 
 demanding thing oc trg sp did during this unusually slow term was to race oc recruit coy to coffee breaks 
 and plan more time in the camp gym the winter tedium was amplified by the fact that the annual advanced 
 winter warfare course was conducted in december of the previous year thus there was no fmc sponsored trek inside the 
 arctic circle during 1988 as well due to the rotation of 408 tac hel sqn to the sinai no winter 
 rappel master serials were conducted despite the slow winter and the lack of courses inhouse 0:in 0:house the roms wo

 ample time to redecorate both the interior an exterior of bldg 164 other sought after positions in trg sp coy 
 such as ammo nco and library nco provided the necessary challenges for mcpl weibe and sgt gates respectively in addition 
 the appointment of holding platoon 0:pla 0:toon nco captured a number of sr ncos one of whom would care to 
 be mentioned immediately after the easter break recruit training began in earnest and with it the demands in support increased 
 proportionately still no one in the coy could complain 0:com 0:plain of stress related overwork symptoms the rq had time 
 to juggle his overages so that he might turn over his duties to wo spellen likewise sgt lawler was able 
 to escape to recruit company leaving the trucks in the capable hands of sgt desjardins sgt gates was pried reluctantly 
 away from the library and forced back into instructional duties mcpl weibe soldiered on in the tdms all of this 
 activity progressively increased with the passage 0:pas 0:sage of summer and the addition of several new recruit platoons 0:pla 0:toons 
 to the nominal roll perhaps most notable of the rqs new challenges was the problem of selecting colour coded shower 
 curtains to divide bed spaces in the recently designated 0:desig 0:nated mixed gender quarters a problem indeed when given only 
 the tawdry options of the local ce and camp supply 0:sup 0:ply sections with the pace now set trg sp

 from the same people all the time nevertheless there are no mothers verified at date of writing 0:writ 0:ing at 
 the battle school to remind us of this guidance hence we did it every year as a test of friendship 
 and tolerance 1988 being no exception the ldsh were only too glad to sign over eighteen of their abandoned vehicles 
 1 ppcli and 3 ppcli were equally as magnanimous in lending their c7s fmc was cordial to provide extra c9s 
 and hq 1 cbg staff officers were only too glad to act as front men for our requests in the 
 end the rqs inventory wound up doubled and his staff halved through the help of lotrp on the positive 0:posi 
 0:tive side the demands of maintaining the extra equipment made everybody on camp wainwright feel lesslikea remf and little bit 
 closer to the battle school we are not only so bold as to deplete other units of the equipment we 
 also place demands on personnel without blushing at all for those instructors drivers medics and mechanics form other 1 cbg

 the units who have served with training 0:train 0:ing support company during 1988 while trg sp coy like any support

 on august 10 it also served as a meet and great for all newly arrived patricias to the base and 
 the area a good time was had by all our final function was the 75th anniversary briefing 0:brief 0:ing in

 55 toronto area patricias by capt b g bailey the year 1988 has been good for the patricias of the 
 greater toronto region as the regimental presence remained significant col almstrom remained the senior serving patricia in the area and 
 commenced his second year as the cos of central militia area headquarters maj tweedie assumed the responsibilities of so2 ops 
 coord as maj goodspeed was posted to the first battalion in time to assist in the preparations for the trooping 
 in 1989 another notable departure was that of col mcmurray who was promoted and posted to cdls washington following an 
 enjoyable year of tutoring majors in particular majors petney 0:pet 0:ney corry and diakow at the command and staff college 
 major diakow became so fond of toronto that he remained as a staff officer at toronto militia district headquarters the 
 only other patricia new to the area was wo halcrow who left the airborne regiment to replace wo bludd at 
 the queen s own regiment the remainder of the toronto area patricias remained intact with the greatest concentration employed as 
 rss in toronto militia district capt cunningham remained at the headquarters while captain day and wo shea supported the toronto 
 scottish regiment capt waddell and mcpl lilly continued with the 48 highlanders and capt wiegand and wo halcrow without the 
 services of sgt strong provided assistance to the queen s own regiment captain bailey combined with mcpl aver to represent 
 the regiment in belleville with the hastings and prince edward regiment two other patricias employed outside the realm of rss 
 were capt gallagher who completed the first year of the military legal training plan at the university of toronto and 
 sgt fry who continued to serve at the recruiting centre the toronto area patricias in conjunction with the toronto branch 
 of the regimental association were again socially active a very enjoyable regimental day was held at moss park armories due 
 in large to the support of transient 0:tran 0:sient patricias who were attending courses such as staff school the broom 
 i 100 game resulted in a scoreless tie much to the disappointment of an otherwise appreciative and exuberant audience a 
 very successful frezenberg dinner 0:din 0:ner was held in may with the new colonel of the regiment bgen graham as 
 the guest of honour the next major event was an association dining ln held at the downsview officers mess in 
 october following the dinner all were briefed by major ret d ron middleton and capt steve sawyer on the program 
 and progress of the 75th anniversary celebrations in attendance were mgen herb pitts who has relocated to the toronto area 
 and col syd frost whose recently published 0:pub 0:lished once a patricia is excellent reading on a more sombre vein 
 mr david pierce a world war i veteran passed away in the fall he will best be remembered 0:remem 0:bered 
 for the poems which he composed and presented at regimental day celebrations the regiment was well represented at his funeral 
 thereby insuring a strong military presence all in all the patricias extended family is vibrant both in spirit and substance 
 in the heart of upper canada but nonetheless many are looking forward to travelling west to participate in the 75th 
 anniversary celebrations kingston patricias there are some members of the regiment who would argue that our battalion in victoria is 
 the best of all postings for a patricia but those serving here in kingston would probably 0:prob 0:ably point out 
 that if you can t be with a battalion this is the next best place to be the arrival of

 ensured a high profile for the regiment in the corridors of power the regular monthly patricia luncheons in the army 
 officers mess continue but someone is still falling short in the ration section popcorn pretzels and barley sandwiches may be 
 fine for you old timers but we young and vital single officers require sustenance believe it or not but corn 
 continued 
 56 plaints have even been heard from staff officers that they would be unable to push the requisite amount of 
 paper due to malnutrition the main purpose of these luncheons of course has been to allow officers to reacquaint themselves 
 with members of the regiment thought only to exist in the regimental history it was the honour of the ottawa 
 officers this year to mug out six members of the regiment in mid august we said good bye to mwo 
 d j macdonell who retired after 35 years service the ceremony was well attended with major general pitts major general

 0:lans 0:downe park on 11 november went off without a hitch and was well attended by patricias and their families 
 also in attendance 0:atten 0:dance were representatives of the korean and dutch governments both of whom laid wreathes it was 
 a moving 0:mov 0:ing experience for all concerned especially for we more junior 0:jun 0:ior members to take part in 
 a ceremony held at the location of the formation of the regiment it is a very simple and dignified 0:dig 
 0:nified memorial and the service was conducted in a like manner preparations for the 75th anniversary are very much apace

 62 saint mary s band by capt p a rechner 1988 in gagetown was also uncharacteristically significant 0:signifi 0:cant for 
 the patricias in new brunswick by allowing us to witness the official recognition on the part of the regiment for 
 the affiliation of the saint mary s band of saint john with the ppcli the ceremony was held in saint 
 john on 20 august at which the colonel of the regiment presented a regimental scroll to the band recognizing their 
 affiliation and past service with the ppcli the saint mary s band in turn showed this appreciation by donating to 
 the regiment the one and only original sheet drum still in their possession that survived service in france during wwi 
 the saint mary s band is one of the most active civilian bands in new brunswick with a distinguished history 
 dating 0:dat 0:ing well back into the last century recent research has established that it has an interesting affiliation with 
 the ppcli which had unfortunately been somewhat neglected with interest by the band s executive to renew this affiliation which 
 began during the colonel in chief s tour of the maritimes in july 1983 the history of the saint mary 
 s band goes back to the boys brigades in saint john but it was not until 1903 that the boys 
 brigade began training as a band and received its present name as the band of saint mary s anglican church 
 during wwi the saint mary s band under the leadership 0:leader 0:ship of the bandmaster charles henry williams enlisted en 
 masse in january 1916 a point of particular pride they went overseas with the new brunswick 140 th battalion and 
 when this battalion was broken up the members of saint mary s band were tos to the ppcli as a 
 group on 25 november 1917 they joined the regiment on the battlefields of france and served heroically as carrying parties 
 and stretcher bearers in the line suffering one killed and two wounded unfortunately it was the bandmaster l sgt williams 
 who suffered fatal wounds at rilloy on 28 september 1918 he died later while under the care of his sister 
 nursing sister 0:sis 0:ter edith williams after ch williams death the ppcli band was given over to his brother harold 
 h williams it was under his direction 0:direc 0:tion that the band played at princess patricia s wedding when the 
 regiment returned to canada after the war the ppcli band was disbanded and the saint mary s band was reformed 
 mostly from former patricias and original members of the band who had served in other units during the great war 
 then wwii broke out the band enlisted again this time under the leadership of bandmaster h e wilson another former 
 patricia it served with a local artillery reserve unit with which it maintained a connection until the 1960 s when 
 the number of military bands was reduced however in recent years under the guidance of bandmasters 0:band 0:masters john r 
 winchester and now bruce r holder the band is returning to a position of strength the french grey battalion is 
 now maintaining a close and growing relationship with the saint mary s band largely due to the dedicated effort of 
 lcol ret d robert l dallison which paved the way for the renewal of the band s affiliation with the 
 regiment the saint mary s band is now the unofficial band of the french grey battalion and proudly wears the 
 ppcli regimental tie as a sign of its long standing ties to the ppcli dating back to wwi all members 
 of the band are looking forward to taking part in the 75th anniversary celebrations colonel of the regiment presents the

 of the corps gather round the royal green jackets the light division depot winchester the depot has continued with its 
 role of producing trained soldiers from recruits and the historic cycle continues that cycle includes the inevitable complaints from battalions 
 that the recruits are not sufficiently well trained and complaints 0:com 0:plaints from the depot that the recruiting offices are 
 not producing sufficiently good raw material and in line with a tradition of many years standing we have been reorganizing 
 0:reorganiz 0:ing our programmes to produce a better package it was ever thus and doubtless our successors in the years 
 to come will do exactly the same n amongst this somewhat cynical view there are some detectable changes first the 
 quality of recruits is slowly dropping as the available pool of manpower within the country 0:coun 0:try as a whole 
 reduces by 30 0 o known as the demographic trough it is a reflection of a lowering of the general 
 desire of the population to procreate some 16 years ago as to the quality of the recruits we would not 
 like to think that the standard is any different but there are problems and the most obvious is the length 
 of training time allowed this has steadily been reduced over the past few years to save money the effects inevitably 
 have been the production 0:produc 0:tion of a less mature and resilient soldier than in the past this has affected 
 particularly the junior soldiers who have a much greater distance to go in terms of maturity from joining 0:join 0:ing 
 at the tender age of sixteen until their arrival in the battalion 0:bat 0:talion only 9 months later the third 
 change stems from the reduction in training times and therefore a need to try to optimize the limited time and 
 resources available it has been an uphill battle but it now appears that our voice has been heard there are 
 currently 0:cur 0:rently proposals from mod to increase the teaching time for the common military syllabus from 8 to 10 
 weeks and a further increase in the infantry special to arm syllabus by an as yet unspecified amount as to 
 the year itself the depot found in itself the centre of national attention after the ballygawley bus bombing of 1 
 li when 8 off duty soldiers were tragically killed by a car bomb when their civilian bus passed by as 
 it returned them from leave to their base at omagh the use of the depot as a home base took 
 some of the pressure off an operational battalion who could have done without excessive media attention few seemed to notice 
 some of the television pictures 0:pic 0:tures which showed the guard on the depot being provided by the blue berets 
 of army air corps continued 
 66 the general flow of visitors has decreased now that the initial rush to see the new barracks is over 
 visitors have ranged from the crew of hms alacrity who came to play sport to the mayor of corunna who 
 displayed an embarrassing 0:embar 0:rassing degree of knowledge about our regimental history in june his royal highness prince faisal bin 
 abdullah bin addul azziz el saud was attached to the depot for a three week period to gain some basic 
 military knowledge and see the way in which we operate there was some initial apprehension 0:appre 0:hension on our part 
 that he would lose interest before the final day of the programme but the visit proved to be a great 
 success with the prince even agreeing to leave an aeroplane and free fall from 13 000 ft attached to cpl 
 skelley and accompanied by major nigel jackson both of irgj and serving at the depot the depot has continued to 
 demonstrate its versatility at sport and this year have become the army major unit cricket champions this was no mean 
 achievement because although with the recruits we are about the size of a battalion for sporting purposes we can effectively 
 draw only from the permanent staff this makes us a minor unit and the pool of men is approximately 135 
 the depot also won the south east district squash league and championships during the course of the year we have 
 bade farewell to capt nick carter the adjutant who has gone into the adc world and is replaced by capt

 of 1987 saw irgj on block leave following our second short notice northern ireland tour in two years on returning 
 to baor in january we found that we faced the enormous task of training the battalion in mechanized warfare in 
 six months so that we could go to batus on exercise 0:exer 0:cise in june exercise medicine man has been 
 the highlight 0:high 0:light of the year and everything we did up until july was geared to ensuring we had 
 a successful exercise in canada in the course of six months we went to soltau for the only battle group 
 training period we were to get before embarkation 0:embar 0:kation took part on two cpxs ran mortar antitank and recce 
 platoon cadres converted the battalion to the new sabo rifle had a weeks firing on the almas ranges went to 
 battle group trainer twice and saw the mortar and recce platoons successfully complete special to arm concentrations 0:concentra 0:tions thus 
 prepared we embarked for canada in mid june we had a very successful exercise in canada largely because of our 
 relative inexperience in mechanized warfare 0:war 0:fare this meant that unlike experienced battle groups our learning curve was very steep 
 and we gained enormously from the freedom of maneuver that suffield allows as well as the very helpful and constructive 
 advice of the batus staff we returned from canada not only having had great fun but confident in our abilities 
 as a mechanized unit the hospitality received from our canadian friends was appreciated enormously by both officers and riflemen after 
 batus we went on three weeks leave before coming 0:com 0:ing back for a period of reorganization and rationalization a 
 large number of cadres are now being run from driving and signals cadres to the first jncos cadre we have 
 been able to hold for two years as many people as possible are being sent away on courses in the 
 middle of all this the rifle companies are carrying out a number of statutory commitments 0:commit 0:ments such as nuclear 
 site guards escape and evasion hunter forces battlefield simulation trials and border patrols all these activities are aimed at ensuring 
 that the battalion has a high level of individual skills which will act as a firm foundation when we start 
 collective training again next year despite the intensity of training we have still managed to fit in a series of 
 other activities the officers mess managed to host a ball this year in which we renewed an old regimental acquaintance 
 with a local german family dating back to our previous tour in osnabruck in the 19505 we were very kindly 
 allowed by the family to hold the ball in the grounds of their house which meant that the party had 
 a very different atmosphere from the normal parties which are based on the officers mess we held a very successful 
 open day on the 12th of june at which the most popular attraction turned out to be officers heads appearing 
 in the stocks to that onlookers could pelt them with eggs and flour the year has also seen a number 
 of visitors including the colonel commandant general sir robert pascoe who visited in june and the colonel commandant of the 
 light division lt general sir peter de la billiere who came in october 2nd battalion commanding officer lt col a 
 m d palmer after a much needed two week break at christmas the battalion returned to warminster refreshed and ready 
 once more for the worst the role of demonstration battalion could throw at it despite the heavy requirement the role 
 placed upon manpower and resources every effort was to be made in 1988 to provide opportunities for members of the 
 battalion 0:battal 0:ion to take a break from demonstration duties during january 0:janu 0:ary over a hundred members of the 
 battalion went skiing in france and italy none broke a leg and the riflemen were able to get to grips 
 with the intricacies of fondue meanwhile several platoons went to scotland to adventure train and conduct 0:con 0:duct some very 
 worthwhile if cold escape and evasion exercises appropriately enough march saw the inter company march and shoot competition designed to 
 assist in the selection of teams for the sw district skill at arms meeting much to the delight of major 
 richard matters the competition 0:competi 0:tion was won by a company during the same month a small group led by 
 captain carl hunter was attached to hms alacrity for a trip via bordeaux to gibraltar naval hospitality was overwhelming and 
 the liberal helpings of claret and lager helped the party to overcome a gale or two continued 
 67 experienced off the spanish coast whatever spare time there might have been left to the battalion in march was 
 taken up by the demonstration of future equipment and tactics for mobile operations in urban terrain mout using some very 
 original and spectacular battle effects provided by a specialist team from paynes fireworks the demonstration orchestrated by the commanding officer 
 was played to an audience of some 150 0 f whom over 28 were brigadiers or above in april came 
 an exhausting team event and one in which an officer always seems to take first place but the sergeants 0:ser 
 0:geants always wins the trophy on team placings this year the officers team consisted of the commanding officer lieutenant colonel 
 vere hayes second in command major tim corry captain simon day and assorted warts lieutenant 0:lieu 0:tenant roger salwey and 
 2nd lieutenants mathew fleming 0:flem 0:ing anthony loyd and edward elton roger salwey undaunted by the fact that he was 
 to run in the london marathon 0:mara 0:thon two days later won in a record time of three hours and 
 21 minutes this event was to be the commanding officers swan song as a week later he handed over command 
 to lieutenant colonel anthony palmer after a hilarious this was your life evening in the officers mess colonel vere left 
 to rejoin the gilded staff as chief of staff of 4th armoured division in herford west germany major bob churcher 
 had discovered in 1987 a rewarding 0:reward 0:ing and cast iron method of avoiding demonstration duties leading an overseas adventure 
 training expedition he repeated this feat over the period april to may 1988 by taking a nine man party to 
 the annapurna area of nepal the party flew to kathmandu via dacca on the bangladesh bimau airline an adventure in 
 itself then carried out a tow phase expedition phase one was the 120 mile annapruna sanctuary trek and phase two 
 the annapurna circuit trip of 200 miles using the services of the sherpal co op agency the expedition was a 
 test for all and an eye opener for many the expedition report written by lieutenant charlie cracknell contained the following 
 paragraph the expedition was a great success all members arrived imagining themselves to be hardened fit infantry 0:infan 0:try soldiers 
 able to face anything they were rapidly disillusioned 0:dis 0:illusioned as daily walking carrying their own pack on a diet 
 of rice and vegetables brought them down to reality 0:real 0:ity this coupled with mild but persistent stomach upsets and 
 some altitude sickness taught each their true capability 0:capa 0:bility and that a bft time of eight minutes is no 
 real indicator 0:indi 0:cator of physical and mental stamina continuing the drift to the far east and in the same 
 month the battalion army cricket captain newly promoted lieutenant mathew fleming by some extraordinary feat of liaison with the light 
 blue managed to get his platoon out to hong kong for two weeks the platoon stayed with 2 2 gr 
 and were very well looked after they spent a considerable 0:con 0:siderable amount of time on the border a task 
 they greatly enjoyed not least because it gave them a wealth of war stories 0:sto 0:ries to recount in the 
 bars of warminster the hectic pace of april was followed by the beginning of the handover of our role to 
 irrw in august but before we could tell the phantom where to put his bugle or maiden her iron the 
 intervening period provided us with time to continue 0:con 0:tinue to display the superb qualities of warrior the mechanized infantry 
 combat vehicle as well as retain our stanglehold on the sw district skill at arms meeting mucl i to the 
 chagrin of 1 dand d there was also time for d company 0:com 0:pany under major john pentreath to conduct 
 a very imaginative exercise exercise delta venture which made us of what seemed to be most if not all of 
 the royal naval air squadron sea king helicopters from yeovilton the company 0:com 0:pany using land kindly made available by 
 captain willy molesworth st aubyn s father attacked ever deeper into cornwall finally and successfully assaulting from landing craft both 
 st michael s mount and the scilly isles before handover 0:han 0:dover and in july came the highpoint or the 
 reverse depending upon performance of the platoons year the bramall trophy the annual inter platoon competition run by major johnathan 
 durcan the competition took place on our back door training area salisbury plain and proved to be imaginative exhausting revealing 
 amusing and above all testing just what one would expect from such a competition august came and the battalion left 
 warminster to plaudits of a difficult job well done and moved to connaught barracks dover the somewhat joyous exodus was 
 led by the demonstration officer major peter jacques who during 0:dur 0:ing the journey under went a metamorphosis to appear 
 in dover as the second in command after a period of block leave the battalion returned to reform from the 
 unique establishment 0:estab 0:lishment accorded to the demonstration role to that of a type a saxon battalion without saxon there 
 was general agreement that the move was very beneficial commanders could command and the accommodation 0:accom 0:modation improved from a 
 twelve man substandard room to four man flatlets we were back to being an infantry battalion 0:bat 0:talion there was 
 however to be scant time for settling in the first two weeks of october saw the battalion change from green 
 to orange acting as enemy on the western district home defence exercise exercise western encounter was given the additional spice 
 of being able to show 2 para blue forces a thing or two the backdrop to september and the home 
 defence exercise had been the start of external courses for the forthcoming tour as the lishankea incremental 0:incremen 0:tal reinforcement

 june saw the battalion deployed on salisbury plain for two weeks on si m ex 88 this exercise was show 
 piece in battle simulation designed to convince the powers that be of the importance of realistic training using electronic simulators 
 we provided an enemy company and all the observer controllers on 1 july we said farewell to our retiring colonel 
 commandant 0:com 0:mandant general sir james glover and welcomed in our new one lieutenant general edward jones it was general

 weeks which sadly failed to bring up any items of value many interesting pieces of wreckage were found which were 
 brought back and will eventually be on display in the new museum in winchester to be opened in 1989 in 
 august and september the battalion exercised in canada at wainwright it was on this exercise that we were able to 
 renew our canadian alliances to the full lt col vince kennedy commanding 1 ppcli calgary a former exchange officer with 
 this battalion gave great assistance particularly in the form of his c company commanded by major wayne ramsden who were 
 an excellent enemy force for our final exercise c company entered a team in our inter platoon competition and did 
 very well our buglers under bugle major lyons were able to blow at the ppcli battle school passing out parade 
 in wainwright and the recce platoon attended a mountain warfare cadre run by 1 ppcli in the rockies whilst in 
 wainwright we were able to make contact with the royal winnipeg rifles in the form of major dennis puranen who 
 was also in wainwright for the militia concentration and this same event provided the opportunity to meet up with the 
 royal regina rifles led by their commanding officer lt col randy brooks we were delighted to have one of their 
 young officers lt colin king attached to our b company for two weeks finally colonel 0:colo 0:nel ernie wesson of 
 the british columbia regiment duke of connaught s own arranged for a joint expedition along the old hudson s bay 
 company fur trail in the wilder regions of the rocky mountains we were very pleased to be able to renew 
 our contacts with our canadian friends and as ever their hospitality knew no bounds we are pleased to report that 
 capt harry emck our late antitank officer has since joined 1 ppcli as the current exchange officer in the summer 
 we held a sounding retreat in aid of prince philips appeal for commonwealth ex servicemen this gave us the opportunity 
 to welcome some of our retired colleagues living in east anglia and we were delighted to see a few members 
 of our former affiliated regiments particularly 0:par 0:ticularly a contingent from the kings african rifles no sooner were we back 
 from canada than we departed again for salisbury plain on the brigade exercise this included an inter platoon competition to 
 test fitness and navigation with each battalion in the brigade staking its reputation 0:repu 0:tation on the result unfortunately we 
 narrowly missed first place but eight of our nine platoons were in the first ten places the main exercise allowed 
 us to use our swift and bold approach to soldiering in the saxon apcs to good effect we were able 
 to show the rest of the brigade the flexibility 0:flex 0:ibility and success one can achieve quickly with a well 
 rehearsed battle group using the ethos of mission orders running at the same time as this exercise we were guarding 
 0:guard 0:ing civil prisoner for the home office in rollestone camp this former army camp on salisbury plain had been 
 turned into a temporary civil prison to cope with overcrowding in the jails however the riflemen enjoyed the change as 
 1988 draws to a close we can reflect on a very busy year which also gave us some notable successes 
 our boxers won the army novices championships we achieved success in athletics tennis hockey cross country running and nordic skiing 
 and our snipers were the best in the infantry 0:infan 0:try at the uklf concentration sadly we have not managed 
 to see much of our gurkha allied regiments in 1988 despite 6th qeo gurkhas being in uk at the same 
 time and we are sorry that our scheme to take capt indraprasa gurung bem currently the 2nd goorkha s queen 
 s gurhka orderly officer to canada with us came to nothing as his royal duties took precedent hardly surprising we 
 shall just miss the return to uk next spring of 1 st 2nd keo goorkhas as we depart for two 
 years in gibralter in march to all friends and colleagues in our affiliated and allied regiments across the world we 
 send our warm wishes for success in 1989 4th battalion commanding officer lt col n a johnson td after the 
 relaxation of christmas leave the battalion was confronted with the annual pre inspection in january which required an immense amount 
 of hard work but also meant that little training was achieved however in february 0:febru 0:ary the battalion held a 
 mobilization weekend on salisbury plain the first time the battalion has carried out such an exercise for number of years 
 there was an excellent turnout 0:turn 0:out for this weekend and everyone had to pass through a number of stands 
 medical documentation and pay before moving onto training stands the exercise finished with a night march followed by a company 
 march and shoot corn continued 
 69 petition and this was all excellent preparation for the annual courage trophy competition which is held at pirbright in 
 march each company entered a team and all acquitted themselves well all teams finishing in the first 15 out of 
 a total of 37 entries in may for the first time 4 and 5 rgj held a joint rifle meeting 
 at pirbright which proved to be an enormous success 0:suc 0:cess and the same event will take place next year 
 not only did it bring the two battalions together but it also allowed for a large number of ranges to 
 be run with a full complement 0:comple 0:ment of staff at the end of june the battalion participated in the 
 annual 56 london brigade exercise again on salisbury plain all the ta elements of the brigade were represented including the 
 newly formed 8 queens fusiliers with their headquarters at clapham 10 para 221 field ambulance and the transport regiment it 
 was an extremely busy weekend 0:week 0:end involving digging a defensive position a night approach march recce patrols and an 
 early morning deliberate attack and as always the riflemen excelled themselves one of the major events this year has been 
 the success of the battalion shooting team under the eternal leadership 0:leader 0:ship of csgt wiggins the team won the 
 london district rifle meeting for the first time in 17 years hopes were justifiably high for the ta bisley meeting 
 the result was incredibly close right up to the last moment when we were just pipped into second place however 
 we won a number of individual events including cpl savides winning the smg and rfn ulmann got creditably winning the 
 young soldiers competition 0:compe 0:tition the dedication and spirit of all those involved in the shooting team and the young 
 blood coming up augurs well for next year the second half of the year proved to be as busy if 
 not busier than we had predicted in early august a composite company of 120 men visited cyprus for a 2 
 week camp in a heat of 96 degrees in the shade riflemen exercised every day on ranges and the dry 
 training areas and it was to their immense credit and in particular their fitness that there were no major medical 
 problems watermanship trainingswimming 0:training 0:swimming canoeing sailing and water skiing took place frequently and the camp ended with a 36 
 hour exercise which tested everybody to the limit we received enormous help from land forces hq at cyprus in particular 
 colonel nigel mogg a previous commanding officer of 4 rgj and 2nd bn the coldstream guards whom we had come 
 to know well in london district and their assistance in every way made all the difference to the cyprus camp 
 2 weeks of well deserved leave was then taken and the battalion then embarked on civilian ferries to the isle 
 of man for the main annual camp this camp took the form of individual cadres for the first nine days 
 culminating in a battalion infiltration exercise with the aim of rescuing the kidnapped governor ably played by an eminent friend 
 of the commanding officer the weather was kind to us and the camp had all the operational benefits of including 
 a sea move which was little different to our operational role of moving to baor and tested the movement staff 
 of the battalion meanwhile to add to an extremely busy period the milan platoon spent 2 weeks at otterburn and 
 finished their camp with a highly successful days live firing when they achieved a most creditable 12 out of 12 
 hits on the moving target at a range of 1700 meters after all the camps there was a short period 
 of three weeks reorganizing before the battalion carried out bibua training at company level before taking part in a two 
 sided fibua exercise with 10 para at longmoor this was a most successful exercise and proved to be the last 
 major training event of the year but not for the adjutant captain james cunliffe who had to face the ceremonial 
 events of mid november the battalion livery dinner was again held in the clothworkers 0:cloth 0:workers hall and two days 
 later the battalion was heavily involved in the lord mayors parade after years of pleading to be allowed to march 
 at rifleman like pace the battalion was ordered to provide a guard of honour of 60 on both the morning 
 and afternoon of the inauguration the celebrate 0:cele 0:brate it was also agreed that the commanding officer and second in 
 command should be mounted on horses the normandy band also took part in the parade the following day the battalion 
 was honoured to provide a guard at the remembrance service at the cenotaph as well as conducting 0:conduct 0:ing our 
 own remembrance service at hanover square and providing contingents for all our affiliated regiments services 0:serv 0:ices on top of 
 all this ceremonial the battalion also provided a guard of honour for the lord mayors banquet and thus it was 
 hardly surprising that december became a month of relaxation socially all the training centres have been busy but the highlight 
 of the year was the celebration of our 21st birthday 0:birth 0:day at davis street pavement licences were obtained stands 
 erected and at 1930 hours on 31st march the normandy 0:nor 0:mandy band entertained a large audience to an outstanding 
 0:outstand 0:ing sounding of retreat in davies street thereafter there were drinks parties in the respective messes with a large 
 officers mess dance in the drill hall we were greatly honoured by the presence of the lord mayor of westminster 
 0:westmin 0:ster and field marshall lord bramall amongst a host of other senior officers and guests sth battalion the sth 
 battalion the youngest and newest of our battalions 0:bat 0:talions is now well established in oxford and buckinghamshire 0:buckingham 0:shire 
 the battalion s first birthday fell on ist january 1988 strength on that date was just on 500 an increase 
 of 100 since the last newsletter the period has been devoted to building the structure of the battalion organization with 
 companies continuing the hard work of improving individual skill and minor tactics the first junior nco s cadre has been 
 completed signals and support weapon courses have been run so that the reconnaissance 0:recon 0:naissance signals anti tank milan and 
 are now viable and the mortar platoon building from scratch at milton keynes is shortly to conduct its first live 
 firing shoot against this background the battalion has had a very busy year but undoubtedly the highlight has been the 
 official 0:offi 0:cial opening of the new ta centre for letter e company at milton keynes by hrh the princess 
 royal in may 1988 the princess inspected a guard furnished by the letter e company commanded by major wf controy 
 the normandy 0:nor 0:mandy band of the regiment was on parade displays and even a visit to the colour sergeants 
 store followed it was a fitting occasion not only to mark the opening of the latest and smartest ta centre 
 but to crown letter e company s success in forming up continued 
 70 the battalion will be fully operational in early 1990 so operation planning visits to baor and formation level training 
 0:train 0:ing are filling the programme letter a company still housed in temporary accommodation in high wycombe has provided riflemen 
 nco s and an officer for irgj s exercise 0:exer 0:cise in canada supported by other companies many riflemen 0:rifle 
 0:men have carried out their first parachute jump with the light division free fall team s help in between the 
 warrant officers and sergeants mess has held their first full summer 0:sum 0:mer ball the culmination of the training year 
 for any ta battalion 0:battal 0:ion is the two week annual camp an this year for the first time srgj 
 went overseas to germany where thanks to the superb support of the 2nd battalion the light infantry and for a 
 week at least of unusually benign november weather the battalion was put through its paces under lt col david innes 
 and the team that he has so successfully built up five days of fast moving helicopter borne day and night 
 action in the beautiful sauerland near iserlohn was followed by a well earned break before a testing and perhaps more 
 realistic spell with the 3rd armoured division on exercise iron hammer though there is some time to go before the 
 battalion comes of age there can be no doubt that the volunteers of oxfordshire and buckinghamshire are early developers and 
 srgj stands firmly on its own feet we welcome visitors 0:visi 0:tors from our affiliated regiments and wish all the 
 very best for 1989 the royal australian regiment captain j m sheridan regimental adjutant 1988 was australia s bicentennial year 
 and the royal australian regiment was heavily involved in the nations celebrations the two sydney based battalions 3 rar the 
 parachute battalion and 5 7 rar the mechanized battalion 0:battal 0:ion contributed company contingents to the bicentennial military tattoo which 
 toured the country during the second half of the year the massed pipes and drums of the regiment 0:regi 0:ment 
 also took part in every performance soldiers from 3 rar were involved in various gymnastic displays and those from the 
 tiger battalion formed a drill team which performed a complicated routine culminating in the throwing of bayonet 0:bayo 0:net tipped 
 7 62 mm fn rifles the l1a1 between members of the team the tattoo was a huge success and members 
 of the regiment were delighted that the ppcli band could also participate further strengthening the bonds of our alliance the 
 highlight of the year was the provision by the regiment 0:regi 0:ment of the royal house guard of the royal 
 residences in london and windsor in april the contingent was commanded 0:com 0:manded by the co of 1 rar lt 
 col john salter and consisted 0:con 0:sisted of members from every battalion the contingent met members of the royal family

 0:fergu 0:son dso mc the late lt col ferguson commanded 3 rar at the battle of kapyong for which the
