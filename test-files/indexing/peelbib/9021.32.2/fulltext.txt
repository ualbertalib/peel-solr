 crowsnest pass train holdup by charles ursenbach august 2 nd 1920 dawned a beautiful day in to bring he crew
 and their baggage back to camp crowsnest pass all nature seemed to be in har on the arrival of the
 train the baggageman mony even the little river leading from crows busied himself throwing baggage tents etc to nest lake
 seemed to produce a pleasing melody the ground there was no platform there other it was not the kind of
 day one would expect an than this there was no activity except for a little event to be triggered that
 would result in the girl getting off the train with a box of groceries greatest manhunt ever in southern alberta
 but and a broom where was the brakeman it was that is what happened his job to help where help
 was needed why at the age of seventeen years i was employed didn t our road crew get off as
 an assistant to h p keith an engineer who there is something strange about this jim was building a new
 road leading to crowsnest i said there must be a reason for it let lake our camp was on the
 east side of crows back and investigate when we got back to the nest river mr keith had gone to
 lethbridge on first class coach looking through the window business and had left me to take care of matters we
 got our answer jim said good hell that needed attention while he was away he got word back to me

 and they too were ed tom bassoff he went on the roof the third sure i was mistaken going back
 to the truck man came from the other car and it looked to me he i saw jim had loaded
 the baggage and he was may have been sitting in the back end and he got disconnecting the magneto on
 the ford truck in up and said hands up i glanced and saw him with a gun and iput my
 hands up he told me the fear that it might be commandeered to take to sit down i grabbed the
 cord and pulled ii once the bandits to another location with the magneto and he said leave that alone and
 sit down and disconnected it would not be possible to start fired a shot at me the engine so with
 jim and i on the ground the man that came in last he got us all out of this car
 and he took the lead and there was some ahead the baggage man in the door of the baggage car
 i was behind brakeman hickey and the other man the engineer and fireman in the engine cab we was right
 behind me and he kept pushing me and i all watched to see what was going to happen kept pushing
 hickey one of the bandits got off on our side of the he got us all on the platform of
 the car and made all the passengers go back but kept brakeman hickev train the north side carrying a large
 hand gun and myself together the man who seemed to he was dressed in a tan coloured shirt and be
 boss told this fellow what to do to see what this trousers and a light coloured hat we could see
 fellow has got and see what this fellow has got we under the train the feet and legs of two
 other men came to the station over the switches and the engine on the south side a shot was fired
 and the train stopped this man said w 3 io stopped the train i said ‘‘ 1 cannot say i
 didn ‘ t stop it ‘ i honestly pulled out in full power taking our road crew believe that spoiled
 them and the second man went with it out to see but i did not see him go i saw
 one the bandit closest to us crossed the track and man lose something i lost twent seven ninety five joined
 the other two there they were three of of compan money and as near aslcanfigure fortyfive of my own and
 my watch and chain them two were clean shaven dressed in tan col they got off someone hollered to me
 to go ond i outed clothes with light hats the third one in dark said is it all right and
 pulled the cord and started clothes with a dark hat he had a moustache out and just about the time
 i pulled the cord someone they seemed to be in no hurry climbing a small fired a shot outside embankment
 hey sat by the fence and rolled and the calgary herald added the following lighted cigarettes then disappeared over the
 low anecdote hill heading south to mr donald manager of the alberta british col but what of the road crew
 the next stop was umbia power company goes the credit for out guess crowsnest station about five miles west jim
 ing the bandits sitting in the first class coach mr drove the truck about as fast as was safe on
 the donald atfirst thought someone was playing ajoke but almost immediately sensed the seriousness of the narrow road around the
 lake only to learn when situation and realizing he was carrying considerable we got to the station that a switch
 engine and cash and over 1000 00 in cheques he quickly shovcaboose had been dispatched to take the crew ed
 the wad in the crack in the seat and confidently back to sentinel when we arrived back at sen waited
 for the command hands up tinel we found the crew full of excitement all the holdup was not very rewarding
 for the talking at once and no one listening we got them three bandits as nearly as could be calculated
 quietened down somewhat and they told us of they got only about 300 including 72 95 from their experience the
 men had lost their money sam jones and his watch which was not ver y much one of them told
 us the question of why this particular train was that he had a new dollar watch tied to his overalls
 held up has been a matter of conjecture ever since pocket with a leather thong he cut the thong and
 it happened there are two theories one is that put the watch in the top of his shoe the woman
 a government paymaster would be on the train cook had not been molested their stories were with a large sum
 of money the other is that mixed and contradictory but they had really had amilio piccarello the ‘ bottle king
 bootlegger an experience of a lifetime from coleman would be travelling with a large the account of the holdup as
 given by sam sum of cash to femie to pay for the liquor he jones the train conductor follows purchased
 there at that time alberta was dry 2 at soon several officers of the law called at our camp to
 ask about the bandits i told them how they were dr essed and that they went over the hill to
 r the south there was nothing more i could tell e 7 t of these officers seemed to be very
 knowing that mrs keith who lived in a cabin 700 feet west of the camp and who was alone with
 her young sons would be upset if she knew about the holdup and that the bandits might be in the
 district i went to see her it was a relief to learn that she knew nothing about it jim and
 others in the camp wee told to say nothing to her about what had happened when morning came i again
 called to see mrs keith she told me that her boys who always got out very early in the morning
 came to tell her thee was a large animal in the trees making a terrible noise she went to investigate
 and saw a man dr essed in dark clothes and with a moustache asleep and snoring r ather loudly she
 decided to watch for someone to take him away it was not long until she saw two mounted police on
 horseback on the road a short distance to the west but upon go 4 ing to where the man had
 slept they discovered he had gone rumors were rife every reasonable story was followed up by the police who found
 that few of the stories had any real foundation it was suspected that the bandits had headed for the united
 states border which was about 50 miles south this lead was followed up but nothing found were they still in
 the area would the police and deputies be able to find them this was on everyone s mind in lethbridge
 pat egan and syd wallace city police detectives were busy gathering information about the trio they learned that they had
 come from great falls montana and had stopped off in lethbridge on their way to work in lumber camps around

 one of the three men sshio held tom bassoff and alex areloff or auloff alex ui crowsnest pass train he
 later was killed while bassoff brother of tom was picked up by police resisting arrest who thought he might be
 one of the wanted men and british columbia was wet but it appears that but sam jones ca lled in
 to identify him testified neither of these men was on the train that he had never seen this man before
 3 when the train arrived at crowsnest station during the four days after the holdup there was an alarm was
 turned in it must have been no confirmed information about the whereabouts reported that had witnessed the holdup because of

 published a book entitled riel and the rebellion 1885 reconsidered saskatoon prairie books 192 pp 12 95 which has become
 the source of considerable controversy particularly among some native groups murray dobbin project co ordinator for the batoche centenary corporation
 in saskatchewan was invited to review the book in turn and with mr dobbin permission dr flanagan has responded their
 two essays are presented here thomas flanagan s riel an unfortunate obsession a review by murray dobbin thomas flanagan sets
 out in his new book to accomplish a very specific task to answer certain questions about the historical role of
 louis riel and the metis people with respect to the anorth west rebellion he feels his contribution will be to
 set these questions in the con text of the day unfortunately for the r eader and i think eventua lly
 for flanagan the book sheds more heat than light on the questions ‘ 7 and fails utterly to put events
 into context in deed the questions he does not address by pos ing the questions he does address in such
 a bias ‘ ed manner the evidence he leaves out and the ‘ removal of events from the broader historical
 ‘ context render this book a fundamentally flaw ed effort as if this were not enough its tone in villifying
 riel is so vicious and patently unfair ‘ ‘ ‘ 1 that the book ver y nearly becomes a diatnbe
 l ouis rid posing historical questions is always a tricky business and historians often differ in the ques the agitation
 he reveals only too clearly where tions they ask yet all historians must put their his bias lies and the
 zeal with which he purspecific questions in broad enough context that sues that bias leads him to contradict his own
 basic questions do not get left out it is here that evidence ignore evidence well established by flanagan fails most
 dramatically hence in ask other historians and indulge in ridicule of the ing were the metis justified in taking up
 metis people and their leader arms flanagan completely ignores a question before dealing with some of flanagan s quescritical to
 understanding the armed conflict did tions and answers it is appropriate to deal with the federal government deliberately provoke the
 the question of bias first let us be clear about metis for its own political ends i e to build
 this question no writer is completely free of political support for the completion of the cpr bias either in methodology
 or ideology yet it similarly flanagan asks was the government is demanded and expected of historians that they justified in
 hanging riel but leaves out entirely be fair to he facts and the personalities of history he absolutely cynical decision
 of the government in too many instances flanagan is not his cvito ha ng riel in order to passify ontario
 in at least dent though unexplained contempt for riel one other instance the question posed is so load leads him
 to conclusions which contradict the ed as to render its answer suspect thus when limited evidence he does bring to
 bear for inthe author asks what was riel s real object in stance he attacks riel for demonstrating ‘‘ self
 24 serving venality in suggesting hat he would ac suspicion that it was quite deliberate and further cept money from
 the government in return for that ottawa at the very least acquiesed in the leaving the country besides ignoring the
 ques plan tion of whether the rebellion would have taken lawrence clarke was a prominent tory a place in any
 case flanagan continues the attack former n w t mp and a long time hbc cxwith no decisive new evidence
 to support his ecutive well known to the metis in early 1885 radical claim that money was rid s principal
 the agitation among the metis had died down motive he condemns rid in spite of pointing with expectations that the
 government would out later that rid was not interested in the money negotiate with an acceptable emmisaiy of the for
 personal use he merely mentions that rid metis clarke was chosen by the metis for the put forward arguments supporting
 the amount of job clarke had let on that he was sympathetic money involved without making any attempt to to
 the metis but in reality was part of a prince determine whether the arguments were valid he albert clique who
 believed that a metis rebellion examines in minute detail any evidence which was the surest way to speed completion of
 the puts rid in a bad light and mentions only in pass railway and the development of the west it
 is ing that which does not well documented that clarke was identified by two key questions examined by flanagan government
 officials as the man to trust with deserve special attention for they are basic to all respect to intelligence on
 the metis before and the others the first deals with the immediate after the rebellion clarke was privy to the
 secret cause of the outbreak of violence the second with code with which messages were sent from otthe dual question
 of rid s rea l object and the tawa to the n w t many historians including legitimacy of the
 rebellion throughout the book norman black a s morton and george stanley flanagan uses extremely loose language referr have come
 to the conclusion that clarke if not ing to rid ‘ s launching of an attack on both a government
 spy and an agent provocateur canada he later exposes his emotional distor was certainly the key figure in fomenting the
 tions when he contradicts this repeated assertion violence albeit in a single sentence flanagan has ignored two specific actions by
 clarke were critical factors in the immediate cause of the conflict that in bringing about the first armed conflict the
 can only be described as decisive first there first was the message he brought back to the is evidence implicating
 j a macdonald in lt metis from ottawa while some accounts sug governor dewdney s successful effort to in gest
 the fateful message which was that ot macdonald s words secure the prince albert tawa s only answer would be
 bullets and that 500 times i e to turn it from a sympathetic policemen were on their way to arrest
 rid was observer of events to a virulently anti rid anti delivered by chance to dumont this is quite reform
 crusader mor e importantly he writes out false clarke was an official and trusted emof history one of the key
 players in the whole misaty and his message was official it had the rebellion and the events leading up to
 it that effect of completely panicking the metis who implayer is lawrence clarke who flanagan men mediately began a general
 mobilization clarke s tions ver y briefly only twice and in very in second provocative act occurred just prior to

 off with the metis having seizrebellion flanagan dates the decision to engage ed arms and both they and crozier trying
 to prein battle back to february 8 1885 the day rid vent the other from consolidating positions read a telegram
 from ottawa stating that the neither side seemed anxious for a fight and government had decided to investigate half crozier
 believed probably correctly that reinbreed claims rid is quoted as having said forcements would seal the peace in this situa
 ‘‘ ottawa will have my answer in forty days tion clarke taunted crozier asking him if he a reference to
 the establishment of a provi were afraid to arrest the rebels and urging a consional government while this step was
 clearly frontation crozier s immature and ill advised a crucial one in the eventual confrontation the response brought on the
 start of the rebellion actual armed conflict was fomented by clarke there is much more circumstantial evidence and in such
 a manner that one cannot avoid the suggesting a deliberate conspiracy by ottawa to 25 foment armed rebellion the purpose
 being to that rid s concept of a vast trust fund for future build popular support for the cpr which
 at the metis generations is an ulterior motive in time was incapable of extracting another nickel fact it was inspired
 precisely by rid s in public funds besides needing the railway as knowledge of the scrip fiasco in manitoba and
 part of the national policy ottawa was being it was exactly this kind of foresight and leaderpressured to assist britain
 in sending troops to ship that the metis expected from rid it was the far east in anticipation of imminent
 war with this capacity which prompted their invitation to russia him neither flanagan nor any other historian is continuing to
 ignore and otherwise distort obliged to accept this circumstantial evidence as history flanagan insists that the government met definitive proof
 of a conspiracy but its weight its obligations this he does without so much as is such that to blithely
 ignore it when claiming a mention of the massive scrip fraud which was to examine the causes of the rebellion
 verges on visited upon the metis after the rebellion a deceit fraud in which the government was complicit throughout the
 book flanagan repeats and informing speculators of scrip commission repeats his favorite themes that rid had a secret meetings and
 eventually passing legislation agenda and that the metis grievances were about preventing prosecution of the crooks there were to be
 met by ottawa to support this latter claim no negotiations with metis leaders regarding the flanagan engages in a tortuous
 effort to make method of land distribution clearly scrip a silk purse out of a sow s ear evidence indeed
 especially money scrip which the government except for a telegram from ottawa saying the could have chosen not to offer
 was chosen in government was going to examine metis order to secure results identical to those in claims is there
 any wonder rid was furious manitoba the quick and easy passage of land there was absolutely no reason for the
 metis to to speculators and from there to immigrants and suddenly trust ottawa flanagan comes to this the creation of
 a cheap farm labor pool out of remarkable conclusion though govern the newly landless metis ment delay may have exacerbated
 hostility it rid s foresight was brilliant his fears justified cannot be reasonably said that the government and prophetic flanagan
 denounces and ridicules ultimately failed to carry out its responsibilities him for ulterior motives and to add insult this remark
 is preposterous and flies in the face to injury he states that the metis did not really of the author
 s own evidence want land at all they wanted money this as for rid s secret agenda ulterior contradicts ever
 ything he said up to that point motives etc flanagan can only maintain his i e that throughout the agitation
 the metis argument by an astonishing failure to put mat preoccupation was with land in the preface ters in historical
 context flanagan reveals his inability to understand the there is virtually no mention of the experience metis conflicts when he
 ridicules the notion that that the saskatchewan river metis faced at red these were national liberation struggles this river after
 1870 illegal seizure of their land is just what 1869 70 represented and its siinilariphysical and racial abuse by orangemen
 that ties to the rebellions of 1837 have been pointed went completely unpunished and the deliberate out by many historians
 the 1885 uprising was delay of the promised land grant in order to en a last gasp of that nationalist
 struggle sure its quick transfer to speculators nor does unfortunately one could go on at much gr eater flanagan take
 serious account of the fifteen years length underlining the serious flaws in this of neglect by ottawa or the desperate
 economic misguided effort for pure nastiness and vengestraits faced by the metis it is precisely this fulness it is unmatched
 in recent literature it is history which explains the rebellion yet the not simply flawed but fundamentally flawed all author
 makes scant reference to it in all it is a shameful and wasted effort that peo this is not surprising
 for to maintain the argu pie would be well advised to avoid unless of ment that riel had secret motives
 far beyond course they are interested in a case study of how the petty grievances of the metis flanagan uncomely
 zeal can lead a good historian to is obliged to ignore history thus he can claim blatantly misrepresent histor y

 ways couldn t quote straight of misquoting an author in fortunate cases dobbin just car elessly gets the words wrong

 this sentence comes from the chapter not shared by most canadians if not a com about river lots whereas he
 quotes it in connecmunist mr dobbin is sympathetic enough to the tion with the question of scrip to misquote it
