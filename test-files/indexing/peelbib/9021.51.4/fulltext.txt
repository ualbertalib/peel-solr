 a number of very published in 1953 publication to one that was almost exclusive important documents all of which appeared
 to academics and at the same time placed in print for the first time in our quarterly great stress on

 of articles could go on and on but missionaries pioneer settlement urban the contributions all have one thing in history
 ranching and so on common they have added to the body of knowledge on the history of alberta the the
 only problem was that we had to rely fifty years of alberta history have produced upon the material that was
 sent or made some two hundred issues almost a thousand available to us usually we were able to articles and
 provide an important corpus of provide something of interest to everyone regional history academics and alberta historians have been very
 generous in sharing their knowledge and not only has the technology changed over the years while other excellent accounts over
 the years but so have the contents of the have come from pioneers amateur historians and others in addition glenbow
 magazine and our readership we have more archives and other sources have been a rich academic articles now and with
 fewer source of documentary history sometimes original pioneers we are getting fewer it was a scramble to have enough to
 fill an reminiscences and when we do get them issue but we always seemed to muddle they are often through
 the eyes of a child through urban history has gained in prominence perhaps because so many of us now live

 the edmonton dunvegan british columbia railway in 1921 in fact there is something for a buff or researcher on almost
 any topic of his time and closeups of almost any personality from mackenzie king contrary to most reports and reviews
 â€˜ billy king was not the lonely reserved politician but a masterly national leader with warm personal friendships to emily
 murphy who berated him on a streetcar crossimig the high level bridge for giving top billing to another speaker at
 a meeting both had addressed and there is a poignant assessment of another editor renowned in alberta history bob edwards
 he was far from the bar roistering rough and tumble fighting character pictured in the public mind at the time
 and by some writers of later days he was a reserved shy little man with an uncontrollable thirst for spirituous
 liquors which he consumed in lonely bachelor quarters at uncertain intervals and which made equally uncertain publication of the popular
 in some quarters eye opener in this cavalcade of stories my personal favourite is one in which clarence howard stout
 appears as the boy of the frontier and as the reporter interviewing a famous historical personality among eager boosters of
 a young western town datehined 1909 it describes the first and only visit of lord strathcona to the only city
 named after him all strathcona looked forward to his coming there were high hopes especially from heroic board of trade
 secretary edmond t baines that the famous old millionaire would surely do something handsome for his namesake city he came
 in his special cpr car with one arm in a sling resulting from a fall or something and was given
 a rousing round of receptions and banquets in fact the works but chins were sagging when lord strathcona left after
 a couple of hectic days and his monetary contributions were modest to say the least in my meeting with the
 elderly lord i told him i had had dealings with him when he held the post of canada s high
 commissioner in london and i was a humble but brash farm boy on an alberta homestead our conjuring creek hockey
 team made its own rink each winter but we rubes had to work in daylight and it was impossible to
 get in any team practice at night we needed forty dollars to get some coal oil lamps in metal and
 glass boxes with reflectors to install on each side of the rink on posts without telling anyone i wrote in
 my best upright script to lord strathcona for a lamp donation ultimately a crested envelope arrived and out fell a
 bank of momitreal cheque for forty dollars signed by lord strathcona himself and a nicelyworded letter warning me that he
 wasn t in the habit of responding to such appeals but in this case he understood the problems we frontier
 lads had to face and he would help get the lamps for our rink during his visit i personally thanked
 the grand old man after many years he had no recollection of the incident no doubt he was fearful strathcona

 during the reserve period beef rationing on the blood reserve a representative of the gazette witnessed a recent issue and
 the following is the way the business is done the cattle are first driven into an inner corral 30 feet
 square this corral has boarded walls eight feet high amid has flooring of three inch plank at the south west
 corner is a door through which the quarters of beef are carried to the ration house through a trap door
 the paunches and entrails are taken out to be cleaned the latter being giveuu to the women for cleaning the
 pautuch the paunch is issued as a tidbit and the intestines are not taken into the ration house at all
 the cattle are shot in the corral and bled the contractor s men engaging indians to skin the animals the
 beef is then placed on hand barrows and carried to the scale in the ration house which is a pine
 log building 40 x 20 feet with a shingled roof and plank floor in the centre of this house is
 a bench made of hogs raised about 18 inches from the floor 18 feet long and six feet wide ouu
 this the beef is cut up into pieces varying from one to five pounds these pieces are placed on a
 raised counter at one end of the building where the scales are situated and is issued to the indians as
 they present their tickets after the slaughtering the corral is thoroughly swept out and sprinkled with dry lime in the
 absence of water the ration house is also cleaned up iii the same way after each issue it is the
 intention of the agent mr pockhingtouu to sink wells at both places so that they can be washed after using
 the work appeared to be thoroughly well done and altogether the work at the new agency is done most systematically
