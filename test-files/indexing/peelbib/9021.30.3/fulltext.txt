 although the sun dance was the major religious the inspector told them that he had no objections ceremony of the
 plains crees it contained to their having a sports day during the treaty payfeatures which were objectionable to the white
 ment but he was not in favour of them holding man and represented an old traditional form of a sun
 dance because it wasted so much time life the government and missionaries attempted such dances he stated not only excited
 the into crush pressure against the sun dance began dians of the reserve but also induced other inas early as
 1882 but by the 1920 s total abolish dians to spend weeks traveliing to and from the ment had not
 yet been achieved not for lack of reserve trying but because of the continued persistence i had spent considerable time
 with the inof those indians who refused to abandon their dians he later reported showing them where religious beliefs in
 past years they had wasted their time in danc in 1921 the indians at the hobbema agency ing and sports
 instead of working on the land and south of wetaskiwin tried to have a sun dance in consequence that they
 were not progressing but were prevented by the indian agent who sent the same as their white neighbours and i
 have out police to stop them during the winter of tried to show them that they have one of the
 best 1922 23 the chiefs and some of the councillors i i the author obtained a ba in cree studies
 from the tianson the inspector of indian agencies sta work among the cree and saulteaux indians he is of the
 hobbema bands had a talk with m chris university of lethbridge and has done extensive field tioned at regina and
 asked him if they could now a resident of calgary above is an earlier view have a sun dance during
 the coming summer of a cree sun dance at onion lake i lindsay informed the indians that he would transmit
 their request to the indian department through the proper channels and would advise them of the decision of the minister
 of indian affairs he then sent off a letter to the commissioner of the rcmp in ottawa reporting why the
 indians had approached him he added his own personal comment on their behalf the sun dance as it is practised
 today is more of a tribal picnic which gives them an opportunity to display theirfinery andl would strongly recommend that
 their petition be granted it is of comparatively trivial importance and acceded to would give great pleasure to these people
 who have no intention of wasting an excessive amount of their time whereas a refusal would be more than likely
 to cause discontent 2 the rcmp commissioner sent a copy of inspector lindsay s letter to the deputy superintendent general
 of indian affairs duncan campbell scott on may 25 th three days later scott replied that the department will permit
 the dance on condition that no contravention of the provisions of section 149 of the indian act are attempted 3
 the department s decision on the matter was reported to lindsay who in turn told the indians it was from
 them that the indian agent found out about it the fact that the indians received permission to hold a sun
 dance and the way they had managed to do so created a commotion both within and without the indian department
 inspector christianson was strictly opposed to the indians holding a sun dance and he complained to the indian commissioner w
 m graham on june 14 th and again on july 28 th arguing hat a sun dance cannot be held
 in two days the indians lose a lot of time getting ready also the moral effect that it has upon
 them is not good as christianson believed that 75 percent of the indians were originally against the idea of a
 sun dance he was upset that permission had been granted i cannot see he complained hat inspector lindsay has any
 right to take up matters pertaining to our department as surely some consideration should be given our officials who are
 on the ground also the indians had had a sports day on may 24 th and were allowed two or
 three days of sports held in connection with the treaty payments during the first week in july to honour the
 governorgeneral s visit to edmonton the inspector felt the indians had had enough holidays and needed to waste no more
 time the main opposition to the sun dance did not chief samson was one of the leading figures in organizing
 the 1923 sun dance reservations in western canada and if they would only turn in and work they would soon
 be in a position to make a living on the reserves instead of having to go out to work for
 white settlers the indians agreed with me that i was absolutely correct in what i said and the largest part
 of them promised to do better this year which they have already shown that they have done in the amount
 of breaking done 1 while some indians may have abandoned the idea of a sun dance there were those who
 could not be persuaded on may 17 th 1923 a deputation comprising chief ermineskin of the ermineskin band and john
 curty of the montana band visited rcmp inspector w lindsay commanding officer of g division at edmonton and requested his
 help in securing permission for them to hold a sun dance some time in june on one of the hobbema
 reserves according to the inspector s report of the meeting they had explained to him that as yet they had
 not brought the subject up with their indian agent w g askay because as he was a new man he
 would probably refuse them permission in order to increase their chances of getting permission and the inspector s sympathy to
 their cause the indians guaranteed him that the dance would last only two days and that they would be on
 their best behaviour in fact they made a special point of requesting the presence of an rcmp patrol on the
 reserve during the ceremony come from the indian agent who was new to authority of the agent and inspectors they
 can go the job and low on the authority ladder but over their heads as they did in this case
 and get what from indian commissioner graham the agent and inspector told them they could not get the department will
 have to come to some definite in a letter to d c scott on july 9 th graham conclusion regarding
 sun dances as the situation is complained that the minute it is known getting out of our hands restricted dancing
 with the among other cree reserves that the indians at authority of the department is not going to mend mat
 hobbema have your approval to have a dance for ters in my opinion 8 a limited number of days this
 will become an graham also wrote the secretary of the departepidemic on all reserves reserves that did not ment on
 aug 24 th and 25 th with similar comdance before will want to go back to this in plaints if
 we are going to continue these another letter to scott on the 10 th he added i sun dances we
 might as well discontinue increasfeel quite satisfied that had the matter been left ing our cultivation and cattle as dances
 such the in our own officers hands there would have been indians hold and farming do not go together ‘
 no dances and probably the indians on the whole with permission granted for the sun dance would have just as
 well be satisfied the indians went ahead with their preparations on aug 4 th he wrote to acting deputy during
 the beginning of july a large number of superintendent general j d mclean crees gathered on the samson reserve about
 ‘something will have to be done to discourage these seven miles south east of hobbema the campdances and it is
 regrettable that the mounted police ing day was set for monday july 9 th and the interfered in this work
 and that they received instruc fourth preliminary ceremony was held that tions over the head of the agent to grant
 pennission evening a mounted police corporal r s to the indians to dance ida not think the police would stand
 for any interference from this department in parker was at the dance site with an indian inmatters affecting them and
 i do nor see how it can terpreter john white to make sure everything be expected that the indians will
 have respect for the was in order after speaking with chief samson s i a this view of a sun

 drawn one with a number white men having been ask through the whistle the sharp staccato note shrieked ed to
 attend the ceremony as a mark of special out always in time with the tom toms and arafurious honour the

 the dance sometimes the band would change the motion and representative of the edmonton journal joe tyr sway backwards and
 forwards some wore expresrell was also present sions of pain and exhaustion yet kept on dancing when they arrived the
 white party could see once in a while the tom tome would stop and the many indians outside watching the
 activities in dancers would disappear behind the barricade going down stiffly and awkwardly to rest but never for the lodge
 some of these indians were on foot longer that twenty seconds when the inextinguishable while others were on horseback the
 mounted crash of the tom rome would continue and all the men all wore large black or brown stetson hats
 time their eyes were glued on the centre post as if and about their necks were brightly coloured entranced neckerchiefs

 their friends when one of the dancers became so exhausted when chief samson had finished other chiefs that he was
 unable to continue he would sink to such as louis bull and panny ermineskin and the ground according to the
 newspaper account old men got up and gave speeches through their special trappings and marks of distinction interpreters each welcomed
 the white men would be removed to give complete some asked questions to the police or to indian degradation 4
 agent askey yet most of all each one em later the drumming ceased and speeches phasized the fact that the
 dance was not to a followed the first to rise was chief samson he heathen god but to the same
 god the white men directed his gaze at the white people present and prayed to and that they were giving
 thanks to him addressed them as well as the indians from the for such benefits as good crops that they

 chief to translate shook hands with all the white people present the chief bids the white men welcome the hadson
 ‘ s bay men the other white men and the men of then chief samson got up and spoke again
 the police they were all of the same law and though with a touch of humour he mentioned that in
 they welcomed the police they resented the fact that the past they had always been friendly with the they should
 have been sent to watch over them they hb co and that the company had always given themselves respected the
 laws of the white men and were capable of maintaining order the white men them a present of a sack
 of tea h g munro wanted to take photographs of the sun dance white replied that he had brought more
 than one sack men had not but on very frw occasions ever been pre of tea he then stood up
 and distributed the tea sent at the sun dance he wanted the white men to and other gifts to each
 of the three chiefs he look upon this dance as a serious matter he did not want them to make
 fun or wrong use of it he would gave a small sack of tea and a briar pipe as he
 ask the red men if they were to agree that the white was handing samson his tea the chief pulled
 off men might take photographs 5 munro s new cowboy hat in fun as if he was one or two
 of the old men talked to the chief receiving that as a gift as well meanwhile the then samson again
 addressed the white people journal reporter was busy taking pictures of the through his interpreter he told them that the
 in scenes inside the lodge with a motion picture dians agreed they could take pictures as machine most of the
 white people left about sundown the edmonton journal considerable publicity the chiefs walked with them to a hill just out
 was created the missionaries heard about the side the camp circle where they said goodbye to occurrence and were the
 first to attack the event them soon after the dance rev ray c taylor of gull the following day cpl
 parker and the indian lake wrote a letter to the edmonton journal agent returned to the sun dance camp to
 observe criticizing the government for allowing the the ceremony that day usually would have in ceremony cluded the gift giving
 feature but as the white if the ‘ sun dance was stopped for three authorities would not allow it this
 part of the years he said why has it been allowed to ceremony was omitted recontinue surely the clear fact
 that we know the sun dance finished at 2 00 p m when the it is absolute and immoral ought
 to warrant the walls of green boughs were pulled away and the creation of legislation to abolish it i would
 like rest of the lodge left to rot as it stood all of the to know on what authority it
 was prohibited sacrificial clothes except for the red ones were before some of us missionaries to indians removed probably to
 be placed in the bush the wonder how to take the spasmodical method of tents and tipis were taken down
 and the camp governmental control exercised over the was cleared by 5 00 p m indians 8 according to parker
 no trouble of any kind taylor also expressed the opinion that the intook place during the sun dance and strict
 order dians got permission from the police for the dance was kept 7 he also stated that indian agent over
 the objections of the indian agent askey was satisfied the way things had been car alberta was not the only

 owned by j ellis has been the scene of innumerable dances stag and breed such a night was last night
 when one of the old time half breed dances took place at the above mentioned academy as usual the half
 breed fair sex were in a large minority and when the black kid instead of taking his share of the
 dance say every third dance stood up for ten consecutive sets to the manifest exclusion of ten other and perhaps
 better men mr hank forbes late detective in the employ of the s w stock association at macleod felt it
 to be an outrage and said so it is well understood all over the world at dances that when one
 gentleman insults another by saying that the other ain t no good anyhow the insult has to be wiped out
 in blood the black kid proceeded to wipe it out in the customary style and with such fair average success
 that mr forbes felt it incumbent to return to town over the midnight plain to fetch his shooting iron and
 proceed in a mor e scientific manner this is how at exactly five minutes after one this morning a sma
 ll but enthusiastic poker party on atlantic ave was startled by a double report the reports followed each other in
 quick succession and may be explained by saying that on mr forbes reappearance at the soiree with his little gun
 the black kid who had smelt powder before at loon lake and other celebr ated fields jumped for the gentleman
 s legs in an effort to upset him the trigger was pulled three times first time no report followed second
 time the bullet went through the kid s hat into the floor third time grazed his arm and ribs and
 entered the floor when the kid bolted for fields and pastures new this is how the dance broke up last
 night the black kid alias john bertrand is well and hearty as for mr forbes he must be having a
 particularly cold ride for the boundary line with the wind at fourteen miles an hour behind him and the thermometer
 fast approaching the zero point but when a man misses three such shots as he did he deserves to be

 newspaperman who fection particularly mrs gould s cooking he the night before had been writing the copy for pleted nortnal
 school in edmonton she returned to high river the couple was separated for long periods but by 1901 boyle had
 sufficientfinances to think of marriage after his visit to the shaw ranch in 1901 father bought a house in strathcona
 where he and his bride would live in july of the following year he was again travelling to high river
 on the line that had been built south from calgary as the heavy rains and a rush of water from
 the foothills had made the wooden trestle unsafe the train had to stay on the track for two days before
 the water went down enough to a llow it to cross most of the passengers didn t mind the long
 wait for those who lived on lonely ranches the conversation with strangers was one of the enjoyable features of train
 travel however j r was anxious and at the other end of the car there was a church of england
 clergyman who was anxious too recently arrived from the old country the clergyman kept complaining how things were done in
 this backward colony and how important it was for him to get to high river as he was coming south
 to officiate at a wedding there by the end of the second day father decided that he should put the
 clergy man at ease by explaining that there wouldn t be a wedding until they both got there the family
 tried to make the wedding as festive as they could with a wedding cake from the first bakery that had
 just opened in calgary it had three layers with elaborate icing and two little white birds on top when the
 bride and groom took the train north the bride was still wearing the grey tailored suit in which she had
 been married and she carried the top layer of the wedding ca ke to give to the groom s mother
 who had recently moved to edmonton from ontario after the low level bridge connecting edmonton and strathcona was completed in
 1902 boyle closed his office in strathcona and moved his fumily to ninth street in edmonton in 1904 he stood
 for election and secured a seat on edmonton ‘ sfirst city council edmonton had outgrown its privately owned telephone system
 father and two other aldermen were sent on a trip to the east to examine telephone systems in larger cities
 while the edmonton aldermen were in new york investigating the bell system they heard of another invention being installed in
 chicago this was an improvement by which the person who was putting in the call could dial the number and
 get the connection directly it sounded impossible but the three aldermen returned by chicago to see for themselves they found
 an efficient system that could expand by leaps and bounds as chicago nominating conventions in the provincial constiand edmonton were
 doing the aldermen recom tuencies would soon be called mended that edmonton install the automatic as soon as the province
 was proclaimed cr oss system announced that there would be no nominating meanwhile less ambitious cities installed the convention for

 the liberals were to control the provincial are sometimes within the party and for the rest legislature from 1905 to
 1921 the party was not with of his political life j r boyle had to fight against out its internal
 divisions and conflicts these inter the c w cross philosophy within the liberal necine quarrels erupted publicly during the alberta

 animosities aroused several years father get the nomination and during that first earlier alberta election campaign the two friends drove

 and they when he was a practising lawyer although after put pressure on him to support the legislation that he
 and mother just made ends meet they what happened he told the legislature never regarded it as a sacrifice it
 was simply a choice they made father enjoyed practising law i was in the chair of the committee of the
 whole house but he loved politics and the new province of the members were about to allow the bill to
 go through when i left the chair and on the floor of the alberta house told the hon members what
 the act meant it did not pass sir and i lost the solicitorship of the one of my memories of
 those days when father implement people just as they threatened i should was minister of education was a thyme he
 recited do if i opposed their bill i wish to tell you sir as at the dinner table that made

 days later the deputy and the chief of there was a large examinations branch in the examinations were back in
 the minister s office department and one of the stories father used to with the examination paper he geometry text
 tell was about a certain geometry exam the and a young nun from the convent of st albert deputy minister
 had come into his office waving she was a girl of about 17 with a pretty inan examination paper in
 one hand and a geometry telligent face text in the other we ve got one of them red yes i

 he wished her well in her profes the most and he took a great delight in buying sion i m

 by the b c ingeometry text and the papers as he went back dians he knew his bible well and
 in later years to his own office he was overheard saying to took pleasure in tracking down old testament himself
 i still thing she should have been places in the holy land to him the stories of plucked adam and
 of the virgin birth were fables and the minister had to serve as one member on he felt better in
 church when there was a new the committee to choose rhodes scholars father minister who did not take the bible
 so literally found this distasteful during the war as he felt how quickly edmonton turned to war in that young
 men who stayed home during the war august 1914 we went to attend the exhibition years should not receive this
 award while their and in front of the grandstand the new soldiers classmates wer e at the front it was
 at this time marched by led by several bands only a few that one of the other committee members suc
 were in uniforms most wore blue suits or ceeded in having his own son a civilian ap overalls fred the
 boyles son and i cheered pointed as a rhodes scholar and clapped as the crowd was doing but father years
 later when i was a university student i just looked sad then mother whispered to us came home one day
 disappointed that a friend your father says many of these men will be killwho had applied for a rhodes scholarship
 had ed it s nothing to be happy about we thought been turned down father said the student was father
 must be mistaken how could these haplucky the worst thing that could happen to a py young men striding along
 winking at the young canadian was to become a rhodes girls be marching to their deaths scholar and that if
 i didn t believe it i should father always enjoyed his own election camread the aims of the rhodes trust
 the aims were paigns but the wartime federal election of 1917 to make the young canadian student into a was
 different father felt bitter when old time member of the british ruling class who would liberals deserted mr oliver who
 had fought for know how to keep his brother colonials in their western rights in the house of commons in
 sir place when he returned to rule in the colony wilfrid s cabinet mr oliver had held one of the
 as a school girl it was something special to most influential posts that of minister of interior have one s
 father minister of education but here and he had the proud distinction of being the only were problems for example
 there was the minister of interior to retire from his post as a british empire at school we were taught
 that poor man 8 he was defeated in 1917 because he the sun never sets on the british possessions opposed
 conscription 9 everyone knew that mr and that britannia rules the waves but at oliver s son had been killed
 in france but it was home father would tell us that the british em never mentioned in the campaign pire
 was only a moment in history and would pass in 1918 boyle left the education portfolio and away just as
 the roman empire had done became attorney general at a time when that ministry because we had been taught never
 to repeat out was responsible for the enforcement of prohibition side anyhing we heard inside the home we never which
 had been enacted in alberta in 1916 although warned our friends and teachers about the british a teetotaler himself he
 was not personally in favour of prohibition and he remained tolerant of those who empire drank j r was chairman
 of the board of management looking back my father never made any of of the presbyterian church and contributed his
 friends feel uncomfortable about drinking he generously because he believed that the church looked upon drinking as a purely personal
 matwas a socially useful community nevertheless ter if one of his friends was working long hours ever y easter he
 carefully explained that the cross on an election or a special assignment and he was or iginally a pagan symbol
 and many reli was someone used to a drink my father saw that gions were based on some type of
 resurrection it was there for him at government house din ners he toasted the king in the usual way and
 thought that teetotalers who went out of their way to toast the king with water were being ostentatious but liquor
 was never served in our home although in the big oak medicine cabinet in the bayroom there was a bottle
 of brandy which was truly kept for medicinal purposes one of those occasions i can remember was at the lake
 liwabamun when my father had helped rescue some young girls from drowning and my mother insisted they swallow some of
 the brandy which probably frightened them more than their adventure when my father became attorney general in 1918 it might
 have been considered an advantage to be a teetotaler but it wasn t for him because he didn t believe
 in prohibition enforcing prohibition was an impossible task for any police force the pressures and temptations the policemen faced were
 tremendous the attorney general suggested that the police commissioner move the policemen every year in the bad spots the bootleggers
 will keep on bribing some of them but at least it will cost them more the fanatical prohibitionists made law
 enfoitement even more difficult j r ‘ s old friend w m davidson of calgary was one of these he
 had been elected a member of the legislature from calgary and he made a point of personally examining the lists
 of alcohol permits just before the house rose one day he announced that in going over these lists he had
 discovered that mr milligan manager of the macdonald hotel had been buying a tremendous amount of alcohol this created something
 of a sensation as edmontonians were very proud of their new hotel one of the finest in the west and
 many m l a s including mr davidson stayed ther e the attorney general could only respond that he would
 investigate the charges mr davidson s newspaper the calgary albertan featured them on the front page the next day when
 the house reconvened the attorney general explained that the purchaser of the alcohol was a mr milliken not even spelled
 the same way he was a paintng contr actor who was doing a job at the hotel and had bought
 the commercial alcohol to thin his paints the hotel manager was furious that the calgary m l a hadn t
 had the courtesy to speak to him first and he made it plain that he would prefer that mr davidson
 move to another hotel later j r was in ottawa at a meeting of the attorneys general in the chateau
 laurier he ran into an old acquaintance who owned the largest distillery in montreal his friend took him aside and
 said there s going to be a new tax slapped on whiskey at the next session you d better buy
 all you can now when he got back to edmonton j r talked it over with his officials all liquor
 purchases most of which wer e made in scotland had to be approved by the provincial cabinet j r couldn
 t explain to the cabinet why he was buying so much liquor all at once because there was also a
 leak in the sifton cabinet for every cabinet meeting various reasons for the orders were devised j r then got
 the orders approved when he minister of finance in ottawa announced the incr eased tax the alberta government following sound
 business practice raised its prices a similar amount jr had made 2 million for the government on a subsequent trip
 to the east jr ran into his old friend the distiller in montreal i must tell you an amusing thing
 about that tax the millionaire said when i told you about it i also told the attorney general of ontario
 johnson he s a personal as well as a political friend of arthur meighen and so he went to him
 and asked him if it were so meighen didn t hesitate he looked johnson right in the eye and said
 ‘ no the attorney general was awfully mad when the tax went on shortly after j r often used this
 incident to illustrate that sometimes a man can be honest only be telling a lie if meighen had even hesitated
 he would have broken his oath of secrecy upon which the cabinet system depends the attorney general of ontario should
 have known that it was most on personalities and whether the federal leaders unfair to ask him have an understanding
 of provincial problems after the war the drivers for government up until world war one there was close covehicles were
 all veterans and one of them pat operation within the liberal party and sir was particularly good he had been
 wounded in wilfrid laurier was personally responsible for he war a lmost losing a leg and still had a severe
 this liaison usually after a session of the limp during the 1921 campaign there was a legislature some cabinet minister
 would travel meeting at which pat was waiting outside the hall to ottawa to clean up matters of common inwhile
 j r was speaking there was a crowd out terest on one of these trips j r was about to
 side and two husky young politicians passed in return home when he received a message that mr front of the
 car when one of them said some laurier requested to see him when he went inthing about j r which
 didn t suit the little driver to the old man s office laurier said i hear he hopped out took
 off his coat and lit into a you have been in ottawa for several days why 200 pounder he had
 knocked him out and was didn t you come and see me j r explained pounding the other heckler before
 the crowd that he had come on a purely legal matter realized what was happening it was only with whenever
 you are in ottawa you must come the arrival of some policemen that the little to see me laurier replied
 after that of course veteran left off j r did by the time the meeting was over pat had had
 after sir wilfrid s death ernest lapointe kept time to cool down and began to worry that the up the
 contact when he came to edmonton he boss might not like his having started a fight would phone j r

 s note the following letter was written by captain drolet of the 9 th quebec rifles from his station at
 langdon just east of calgary on the main line of the cpr to his father in quebec started on june
 10 th and completed a day later it provides a glimpse of life outside the war zone during the 1885
 riel rebellion this letter originally appeared in the morning chronicle quebec june 19 1885 my dear governor i received this
 week your letters of the 13 th 25 th and 30 th may last they were left at crowfoot or
 at some other place i suppose i am now in a pretty good room and i am very well compared
 with the others the colonel sends me papers and as i have a couple of books and tobacco i manage
 to get along pretty well jam gathering relics of the expedition i have two blackfeet knives and sheaths a whip
 some paint bags a bullet pouch moccasins a pair of polished buffalo horns a squaw s belt and some ornaments
 so you see that along with my photogr aphs and what i will get more i will be able to
 fix up my room the indians pass here now and then so hat i am able to procure those things
 at reasonable prices we are enjoying beautiful weather and the prairie is covered with flowers of every descrip this rare
 photo shows a number of the 9 th quebec rifles with indians near calgary in 1885 not believe it is
 the common badger for it is not at a ll like the prairie badger described by humboldt if you could
 send me some of audubon s humboldt s or cuvier s books i would be very much obliged to you
 as i could see for myself if their descriptions of the prairie animals are accurate june 11 1885 i had
 to leave my letter unfinished yesterday so i will continue now you see that i am as bad as yourself
 i had to stop short yesterday to play the judge you may imagine the fine figure i did cut two
 indians came to me to decide who was the owner of a lariat they kept talking to me for about
 an hour and as i understood their language as much as tion we are in what is called a rolling
 prairie it looks like the sea sometimes you find yourself in a hollow and in front of you is a
 kind of wave the buffalo holes and small lakes are numerous and ar e covered with ducks plover snipe etc
 now and then you may see antelopes but they are getting exceedingly rare and like the buffalo will soon be
 a thing of the past skulls and ribs of buffalo are scattered all over the prairie and one may imagine
 how numerous they must have been before the building of the canadian pacific railway they are not to be seen
 except in the foothills of the rockies and only in small herds hebrew i did not know the deuce was
 the mat we have a few white visitors occasionally and ter until a half breed came and explained me the
 it is always a pleasur e to see somebody this meaning of their gibberish after he had explain week i
 had the pleasure to meet father doucet ed everything i did not know who the owner was o m i
 he remained some time in camp and i more than before so i just took a quarter out of had
 quite a long chat with him he acknowledgmy pocket and tossed head for one and tail for ed to me
 that it was perfectly useless to try to the other tail turned up and i adjudged the lariat convert adults
 the only thing they can do is to this judgement is as good as solomon s or any take children
 and instruct them some of these body else s the recorder of the city of quebec turn out good but
 the great part forget everything included the next time indians come to me to as soon as they are out
 of school and as a church act as a judge i will ask a fee for my trouble of england
 clergyman told me the same thing indians are numerous here to day they come about his flock i can say
 that the poor misby gangs of three or four with their squaws sionaries are not much repaid for their trouble
 papooses childr en ponies and dogs each gang another visitor here is mr goldfinch a ranhas about three or four
 ponies and twice as many chman near langdon he is an ex lieutenant of dogs the squaws pitch the camps
 raise the a highland regiment and as he is a perfect tepees tents light the fires and do all the
 heavy gentleman a visit from him is always a great treat work while their lords and masters sit down and
 col evanturel passed here to day on his way to quietly enjoy a good pipe it is one of the
 queerest calgary and will go back to gleichen in a cousights to see these indians wr apped up in ple
 of days blankets of every colour travelling in the prairie wit h their little ponies and dogs the buck comes
 we are gr eatly troubled with mosquitoes they first riding on the finest pony of the lot with come in
 crowds at night and they are the cause nothing else but his rifle slung across the pom that i say
 my prayers backwards more than once mel of his saddle then come the squaws leading we are literally eaten up
 by them and the boys their ponies by the bridle with their papooses say he sweet souvenir of the north
 west mostheir back and last but not least the dogs quitoes will stay with them as long as they live
 the train is in sight and i must cease wasting the indian dogs are never to be forgotten some of
 them look like coyotes prairie wolves paper others resemble foxes c they are as wicked my best love to all
 as blazes and i would pity the quebec policeman yours affectionate son tr ying to catch one of them to
 see if he had a medal j drolet the imposter it will surprise most of his friends to learn that
 capt hamilton is not capt hamilton at all but in reality capt goodwyn it is the unexpected that happens and
 it all came about in this fashion when mr hamilton came to this country years ago he was not overburdened
 with wealth and following the usual course of scions of good families in reduced circumstances when they enlist ‘ way
 down in the service he joined the mounted police force under the assumed name of hamilton this name he retained
 divulging his ancestral cognomen to only a few intimate friends but the escutcheon of the hamiltons has been in no
 way tarnished by his wearing of the name for there is not a more respectable or more highly respected ma
 n in the community than the whilsome capt hamilton he rose rapidly in he mounted police ranks and during the
 rebellion was made a capt of militia by gen middleton capt goodwyn has recently come into a considerable property in
 the old country and it is now necessary for him to assume his paternal name this step however in any
 case he proposed taking in a ver y short time calgary tribune july 10 1886 valleyview s first settlers by

 to be a pleawork of the early roman catholic missionaries sant lady and her daughter katie was quite pretty at
 sturgeon lake based on the early records kept following myles mcdermott the next person by bishops and priests of the
 order of mary irn to squat on land at red willow creek was paul maculate and by the dedicated sisters
 of pro badger a hard working metis he was born in vidence after they arrived in october 1907 the bad
 heart river area near sexsmith on among he references of myles mcdermott is sept 2 1864 and lived to be
 about 109 years an account of baptisms conducted by father of age paul had first gone to red willow creek
 dupin at sturgeon lake between sept 22 and in 1904 and had squatted on two locations there oct 5 1884
 mr m mcdermott who acted building log houses and barns on both places as one of the godparents was an
 irishman and in the fall of 1905 fred c young visited the a fur trader at the lake the priest
 would stay badgers on their land where the first furrows had at his mcdermott s place when on visits mr

 found a so the marriage took place later on june 1887 homemade hay baler that he had built out of
 and hey had some twelve children lumber that he and his brothers alex and dan mcdermott also was referred to
 by bishop had whipsawed by hand the baler worked quite grouard who commented fur trading is strong well when my
 brother alex john and i watched at sturgeon lake and three merchants fight it it being operated with a team
 of horses in 1917 out one of these is mr mcdermott he s in addition to these two squattings paul
 and not he best trader but he favors the priest s work his brother s oper ated two stopping places
 one among the indians this observation was writ was at sturgeon lake on their father eli ten in january 1902
 the two other traders were badger s 70 05 acre settlement lot he had been harry garbutt of bredin cornwall
 s tr ading given on the r eserve the other was at the point post and the metis trader deome
 desjarlais who where the old winter trail between high prairie had located there about 1899 and sturgeon lake crossed the
 little smoky bishop grouard s 1902 observation didn t end river about a mile north and six miles east of
 there he added father falher has been corn valleyview the secondary highway between ing here for ten years but he
 had no decent place valleyview and the community of sunset house for his rectory and chapel only a poor hut
 mr crosses the little smoky close to where paul mcdermott would lodge him at his place as he badger s
 old stopping place stood did for me during my eight day stay at the the badger s also had cut
 hay on two other lake meadows besides the ones already mentioned evidence that mcdermott squatted on land in one of
 these was a large horseshoe shaped piece the red willow creek area is found in the diaries of land on
 the west bank of the little smoky of land surveyor arthur st cyr who in 1904 comprising parts of sections
 6 and 7 70 21 w 5 and 1905 referred to having reached mcder the other was much smaller lying
 on the east bank of that river it is part of the ne ¼ l 70 22 w 5 the
 badgers built a log house and barn on the biggest of these two meadows occasionally some family members would live
 there in winter and feed the livestock one of paul s sisters julia and her husband at that time lived
 cosily for quite a while in a log shack built into the side of one of the sandy ridges there
 near the north side of the meadow all you could see of their shack was the front wall the rest
 of it was hidden by sandy earth the badgers were active in the making baling and selling of hay while
 paul and his sons were experts in the construction of excellent log buildings and the making of snowshoes the first
 two white men to legally file homestead entries on crown land in the area were w w o bill brown
 who on july 17 1916 filed on the swv 4 24 69 22 w 5 and daniel dan mcmillar who
 filed on the se i 4 of that same section on august 1 of that year the browns travelling from
 mirror alberta with their four month old daughter kathleen had a rough trip from edson about 15 miles north of
 that town on the atrocious winding muddy excuse for a road ca lled the edson grande prairie trail they had
 come to a bad mudhole which though they tried their best their team of horses could not cross with the
 heavily loaded wagon bill brown had been told that there were scores of even worse mudholes farther north on the
 trail and all of them would have to be crossed on their way to red willow creek his wife evalina
 an 18 year old five foot five good looking brunette with dark brown hair and brown eyes broke into tears
 when her dejected husband announced that they would have to leave their wagon and much of its load of household
 goods by the side of the trail they would load whatever goods they deemed most essential onto pack horses of
 which they had several along and use their two good saddle mares to ride the thought of leaving some of
 her treasured possessions along the trail wasn pleasant prospect for he young woman but as bill said there was no
 alternative open to them he was not given to tr ying to do the impossible even with pluck and determination
 and the best of luck bill was well aware that they likely would have to discard more of their stuff
 before they could reach the red willow creek country bill was born at rainy river ont in 1890 and was
 25 years of age at the time he set out father not her husband who had been a ferryman dick
 was an inveterate tobacco chewer he on the little smoky not the big smoky river spat out tobacco juice at
 intervals that seemed crossing timed with such precision and regularity hat one evalina s husband didn t move to the
 peace could almost measure the distance between places river country until he had gone to the homestead by counting dick
 s black spit marks on the snow there in 1916 in fact it was his wife s father he died
 in 1932 at 76 years his wife eliza passwho told him about the meadow on the little ing away two
 years later smoky upon which he subsequently filed in the next to file on a homestead at red willow 1916
 creek was my father alex j williamson who bill and evalina brown were well pleased with homesteaded the se 14

 money to paul badger s stopping place be made on an unimproved homestead and no dick was a first class
 carpenter who did a lot work within almost 80 miles most homesteaders of work around sturgeon lake for the crees
 and had to spend the greater part of each year workothers he broke several acres of rich meadow ing in
 grande prairie or edmonton in order to land on his squatting that year and became progress at all some went
 much farther famous for the great quantities of potatoes and in our own case father s homestead was only onions

 we lived and it was only about a two hour here is what molly waller had to say in reply

 i remember the terrible winter of and hauling the mail and finally he entered the 19 l 9 20 at
 red willow creek and i can recall fur trade and did some commercial fishing how your mother and all you
 boys had to move the longest continuous period of residence out to your father s homestead there from duties we
 put in on father s homestead was dur sturgeon lake near the end of january 1920 ing the terrible winter
 of 1919 1920 when the and take your few head of cattle with you so you snow was four feet
 deep and lasted until the end could feed them there because it was impossible of may we had put in
 considerable residence to haul hay to sturgeon lake then on account of haying in the summer then we simply had
 to the great depth of snow on the ground a bit move out to the homestead and stay in our
 cold over four feet the beaverlodge weather records shack from the middle of january until the snow showed at the
 agricultural research station disappeared in the spring we were feeding some there cattle at the lake that winter until the
 snow got the snow didn t disappear until the end of so deep the teams couldn t pass each other
 when may that year so you couldn t return to the lake they met while hauling hay on the trail
 until then and we had floods that year the since our supply of hay was at the homestead school section
 was all under water for quite a for the most part with just enough to feed while as were other
 low lying parts of the father s horses hat hauled the mail between home settlement and grande prairie mother and
 most of us i also recall your brother ernie who was youngsters had to take the cattle to the homestead
 about two years old at the time developing and feed them there until spring pneumonia there fred noskey the sturgeon
 the only other persons in the red willow area lake r c mission s hired man drove two during that
 winter of 1919 1920 were the dick sisters out to see ernie and bring him medicine hayes and bill brown
 families the paul badgers he was very ill for a while your mother worand the john l waller family ried
 about him no wonder i wrote to one of john waler s daughters who while there had been a few
 other settlers who now lives in holland asking if she could had built a log shack on their homesteads and
 remember our stay on the homestead that winter had spent all or part of the summer months there none of
 these lived at red willow creek that ready for them and by autumn they were cornlong cold winter thousands of
 head of cattle fortably established some land had been cleared starved to death during that time for the lack of

 boulton centre near sherbrooke que a thoroughbred scotch collie not having proper means of caring for the animal he sent
 him out to a cousin in fort saskatchewan a few miles east of this city where it was arranged he
 was to remain until mr brill had got settled and could look after him properly shortly after arrival at the
 fort the dog disappeared and after a diligent search and when days had passed into weeks and weeks into months
 and still nothing was seen of him he was given up as lost or stolen on march 29 of this
 year just 19 months since he was last seen at fort saskatchewan mr brill received word from his former home
 at boulton centre that the dog had turned up there thin as the pr overbial r ail emaciated almost beyond
 recognition shaggy and torn apparently by many a brush with vicious dogs and barbed wire and bearing all the telltale
 markings of weary miles of travel of long months of starvation of exposure to bitter winter weather encountered in perhaps
 the most remarkable journey ever recorded of a domesticated dumb animal the distance from fort saskatchewan to boulton centre is
 roughly speaking 2 550 miles and even the most dormant imagination can picture the almost insurmountable difficulties the shaggy little

 we could not have children so making a farm had hill s letter books are closed pending the completion of
 microfilming a three reel microfilm little point when there was no one to whom we could leave it ed index
 to the entire papers is available on interlibraiy loan accordingly in 1936 we wrote to edmonton about adopting a baby
 boy we received a most editor alberta history kindly letter from mr hill telling us of the procedure such as
 giving references this we did may i register a protest against the unfair treat and in due time mr hill
 wrote us again telling ment accorded charles hill in the article us that at that time there were no suitable
 babies charlotte whitton and the babies for export but that as soon as there was one that would controversy 1947
 1948 in the winter 1982 match with us as our child he would let us know number of alberta history
 i picked up my mail at the ghost dam plant i do not think that the article should have been
 as i sold them milk daily one day there was a written while people like myself and my son letter
 from mr hill advising us that our baby whom we adopted through mr hill and many would arrive in calgary
 that day i rushed home scores like us are still living unless you have from my milk deliveries and loaded
 my wife in adopted a child you cannot realize what uncer the light delivery we used she had just had
 an tainties can be raised even when the child has operation on her feet and made very fast time become
 an adult that article should not have into calgary mr hill had told us that the nurse been written for
 at least another 30 years from bringing david would also have a two year old now you will never know
 what doubts you have girl for another family when we got to the staraised in innocent families whose only sin
 was tion the train was nearly due and a man and his that they wanted a child so much that
 they took wife and two small children were waiting at the a child and gave him or her a home
 gate onto the platform i got permission from the plenty of space has been given to miss whit policeman to
 go onto the platform the train was ton s wild and vague words condemning mr four cars long no nurse
 got off the first three cars hill s methods of adoption but except for some then one got off the
 rear of the train holding poetic licence not meant to be taken seriously a baby i never asked if it
 was our baby or nowhere have the authors bothered to find out anything the nurse just laughed and said it
 was just what those methods were obviously mine she had to go back into the car it should have been
 obvious to the authors that for the little girl so she gave me my baby say if many albertans had
 been uneasy about the ing i might as well get practiced up my wife lode findings and whitton s single
 minded was in her wheel chair in the rotunda so the crusade while feeling that charles hill had been nurse
 myself and baby and the little girl went railroaded this was a clear signal that there was down the platform
 to where the family we had another side and pethaps the most important one noticed were standing the little girl
 ran ahead to be examined that is what the people who had of us the man opened his arms she
 ran into them adopted children through mr hill thought of his and he lifted her onto his shoulders just like
 that met hods i gladly give my testimony and surely that is adoption a sight i shall never forget scores
 of other families would do the same why i have thought of them many times in the nearly were not
 some of us contacted it would surely half century since then but never have i ever have been an easy
 piece of research and one that doubted the success of that adoption miss whit ton may prate of science but
 need and love mat and he was just the kind of man we expected ter more miss whitton must have
 lived a ter but the amazing thing was the wall in his office ribly empty life not to have known
 that it was simply covered with photographs of while we were in the station with the nurse parents and their
 babies scores and scores of i remarked on the splendid layette that she had them sent by grateful parents i
 wonder if given us she explained that often otherwise ex charlotte whitton had on her walls anything cellent prospective parents
 had not much money showing such happiness and gratitude this was of course in the depression and so this is
 the sober truth a personal testimony they wanted to make sure that a lack of money to one of the
 best civil servants alberta has ever would not handicap the baby s adoption how had much further could thoughfubness go
 h g peck and so my wife david and i went home he lethbridge alta became the centre of our
 lives and remained so though my wife died nearly twenty years ago a while after we had become our threesome
 we editor alberta history had a letter from mr hill this was a delightful personal letter asking how david was
 doing on behalf of the university of alberta library another official would have sent an impersonal i would like to

 of son and we wanted him to have mentioned in the preface a man whose memory our name so that
 we could be proud of him this of alberta stretched back to 1896 he used to brought up the matter
 of his birth certificate here live across the street from the university and again mr hill had already thought how
 he could often dropped into my office to reminisce i had make this rather delicate step in adoption as gen
 a small part in the revival of the society in 1953 tie as possible and we were given david s
 birth the society has been fortunate indeed to have certificate made out to fit whatever circumstances hugh dempsey as its
 competent editor these would arise in david s future again could many years thoughtfulness go further bruce peel and lastly
 my wife and i went to see mr hill librarian to the before i went overseas in the war to
 thank him university notice at the last annual meeting of the historical society of alberta the decision was made to
 increase the annual membership to 10 00 a year members receive the quarterly issues of alberta history and notices of
