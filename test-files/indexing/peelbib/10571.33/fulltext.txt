 5 editor s page the first calendar year as regimental adjutant has slipped by and i make this report with 
 a degree of personal satisfaction the regimental museum was officially opened on the 12th of september 0:septem 0:ber by that 
 most gracious lady mrs d b gault the museum is now complete 0:com 0:plete and literally bursting its seams during 
 the year we continued to receive donations many of which will have to recline in the archives and be rotated 
 with other displays as time goes by of particular note was the acquisition of the victoria cross awarded posthumously to 
 sergeant robert spall the search fcr the third and final victoria cross awarded to a patricia came to an end 
 when we learned of its loss in a house fire in 1955 more tragic was the fact that a mother 
 the granddaughter of lt hugh mackenzie vc dcm and her three children perished in that fire during 1969 i was 
 able to make two journeys of great significance to myself the first was in may when i had the privilege 
 of attending the ceremony 0:cere 0:mony of presentation of new colours to the second battalion in germany the second was 
 a trip to victoria in october to pay my first visit to the queen s own rifles of canada which 
 will become our new third battalion in the last issue of the patrician we promised that a newsletter would be 
 produced this is now a fact and during the year three issues were published under the title regimental newsletter it 
 is our intention to publish 0:pub 0:lish and distribute it on the ist of each march june september and december 
 0:decem 0:ber the first three issues carried 35 49 and 64 items respectively the newsletter appears to be well received 
 and we hope we can maintain 0:main 0:tain its momentum we would like to remind all our readers that a 
 line or two of news will always be appreciated we may not be able to answer a letter personally but 
 ask that its entry in the newsletter be accepted as an acknowledgement the ppcli association business continues to be handled 
 from the home station and we are pleased to advise that the membership for 1969 was 699 an increase of 
 12 over the previous year i know that i speak for the members of the regimental executive committee 0:com 0:mittee 
 and the executive of the ppcli association when i suggest to all our readers that it requires a continuing effort 
 on all our parts to dig out former patricias when one considers the thousands of men who have passed through 
 the regiment since its inception in 1914 the number 699 is rather small it is up to us to keep 
 the association alive and by the same token ensure that the memory of our founder brigadier a hamilton gault hammie 
 as he was known never diminishes to those of us who are now serving in the regiment we have a 
 second responsibility to the association each and everyone of us should take an active part in the association branch in 
 our locality it behoves us to attend their meetings and social functions and encourage our younger compatriots to do the 
 same by the same token when the time comes to retire we can continue our companionship with the regiment by 
 remaining active in the association

 8 the next point 1 would like to raise is that of the patrician the publication of our annual journal 
 is delayed each year by the late arrival of reports and or articles it is my sincere plea that all 
 copy for the patrician 0:patrici 0:an 1970 be in our hands by the 31st of january 1971 please consider the 
 benefit of obtaining your copy in the early spring when the news is only a couple of months old rather 
 than july or august when it is already over half a year stale one final comment of significance to all 
 patricias former or serving at the annual general meeting of the ppcli association held on the 14th of september 1969 
 at the home station a motion was placed before the meeting was discussed and duly carried which is recorded as 
 item 18 of the minutes appearing on page 89 of this edition of the patrician this recognition of all surviving 
 members of the patricias who served in world war one is small compensation for the esteem and high regard we 
 hold them in as honourary life members of our association we salute them to sign off my notes for 1969 
 i would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone for the co operation i have received as your regimental 
 adjutant 0:ad 0:jutant to attempt to name individuals who have been of assistance to myself and my staff would be

 i nigeria january to june 1969 by brigadier general c j a hamilton mbe cd bgen c j a hamilton 
 commanded second battalion princess patricia s canadian light infantry from the 11th of may 1960 to the 16th of january 
 1962 on the 26th of january 1969 1 arrived in lagos nigeria to commence a very unusual and interesting tour 
 of duty as a member of the international observer team the idea of such a team originated with the federal 
 military government 0:govern 0:ment fmg of nigeria the fmg invited the governments of canada sweden poland and the united kingdom 
 to send a distinguished citizen to investigate secessionist biafran charges that genocide was being carried out against the ibo people 
 genocide was defined as the destruction of a race of people and their property with intent to destroy that race 
 the idea of international observers was unique in that it was the first time in history that a belligerent has 
 opened its doors to international neutral 0:neu 0:tral observers to see and report at first hand how a war is 
 being conducted albeit a civil war the investigation was not limited to the countries chosen to send representatives 0:repre 0:sentatives 
 to the international observer team the organization of african unity aou was invited to send observers and observers arrived from 
 algeria and ethiopia in addition the secretary general of the united nations 0:na 0:tions un was also invited to send 
 a special ambassador to make a firsthand 0:first 0:hand report in tact there were three observer teams but for ease 
 in 
 12 administration the members chose to work together and shared a conference 0:con 0:ference room at the federal palace hotel 
 in lagos deplaning in lagos was similar to walking into a sauna bath temperatures 0:tem 0:peratures ranged around lisf the 
 humidity of a west african coastal city is to say the least rather extreme 1 was met by my predecessor 
 major general w a milroy dso cd who had served with the team since its inauguration in august 1968 along 
 with members from the office of the nigerian permanent secretary of defence 0:de 0:fence the usual press interviews followed photographs 
 were taken and i proceeded to my hotel the federal palace my lagos home for the next six months the 
 accommodation was excellent by any standard the rooms were air conditioned the gardens tennis courts swimming pool and jetty all 
 located in the expansive grounds of the hotel which lay adjacent to the lagos harbour made a picture setting the 
 federal palace hotel abounded with europeans ranging from entrepreneurs to oil riggers the international observer team s method of operation 
 was left entirely 0:en 0:tirely to team members the chairmanship rotated every two weeks between the senior members from canada 
 sweden poland and the united kingdom the observers from the organization of african unity and the un did not share 
 in this responsibility the chairman acted as co ordinator with the federal military government on all administrative details and as 
 team spokesman on matters of interest to all team members the team members planned their own trips decided on places 
 to be visited and on trip objectives and in fact were free to go wherever they wished and to see 
 what they wanted to see we saw what we wanted to see and we reported things as we saw them 
 the good and the bad and in every instance our recommendations to the fmg were acted upon if it was 
 in their power to do so i would like to emphasize this point recommendations concerning the improvement of conditions of 
 refugees the conditions of prisoners of war and the urgent needs of state administrators in the states adjacent to the 
 war area were all received in good faith during my six month tour there was only one exception to this 
 and that happened on my first visit to 3 marine commando division commanded by colonel benjamin adekunle adekunle had been 
 told by his superiors at lagos that the team members headed by brigadier sir bernard ferguson uk would arrive in 
 his division area to visit pow camps and refugees in port harcourt only he insisted that our visit be restricted 
 as authorized he refused to be moved from this position a formal protest was placed with the fmg on our 
 return to lagos and an observer team which i headed returned 0:re 0:turned immediately to port harcourt to carry out 
 an inspection of the entire divisional area during subsequent visits to the ist nigerian division in the north 2nd nigerian 
 division in the west and 3 marine commando division in the south we saw hundreds of thousands of ibos collected 
 into refugee camps or rehabilitated into liberated villages they were being taken care of by agencies working under the aegis 
 of the international committee of the red cross icrc or the fmg forces and local rehabilitation committees icrc food supplies 
 in all areas were more than adequate to meet the need six month s stocks at the then current distribution 
 rates were stock piled in each of the divisional areas team members travelled from lagos to divisional areas by commercial 
 
 13 airlines nigerian air force charter airlines and some by road in the divisional 0:division 0:al area we travelled by 
 whatever means of transport were readily available often military commandeered civilian cars with faulty batteries and smooth tires added needless 
 hours to our travels we all became adept at pushing vehicles on occasion the team of nine would set out 
 in three vehicles but complete the journey in one two having become unserviceable our visits to sector brigade and battalion 
 headquarters always had their bright spots many of the young officers had trained abroad mostly in the uk but many 
 at camp borden ontario they rattled off names of their instructors and were extremely pleased to welcome us to their 
 field headquarters 0:head 0:quarters those that had trained in canada knew the patricias as a fine regiment through contacts made 
 at camp borden such as colonel j c jim allan dso mbe cd and major d don ardelian cd we 
 managed to visit forward defensive positions and talked to hundreds 0:hun 0:dreds of soldiers sometimes through interpreters we were able 
 to establish beyond any doubt that all soldiers were aware of their code of conduct a document issued by their 
 commander in chief which set out very humane and creditable rules for the conduct of war including the treatment of 
 civilians and prisoners the friendly nature of the soldier was surprising we were always warmly 0:warm 0:ly welcomed soldiers seemed 
 to go out of their way to speak to us saluting discipline was of a very high standard i think 
 the international observers were probably the most senior officers ever seen by nigerian soldiers particularly 0:parti 0:cularly as battalions were 
 commanded by majors sectors often containing as many as 14 battalions commanded by lieutenant colonels and divisions containing up to 
 three sectors commanded by colonels nigerians have a wonderful sense of humor they love to laugh and are quick to 
 react to an amusing story or a well told joke their sense of humor on occasion showed a high degree 
 of sophistication while lunching with a group of company officers one of my colleagues inquired as to the nature of 
 the food we were eating by saying what is this one of the company officers 0:of 0:ficers responded with a 
 laugh you mean who is it officers messes in the field were well developed there was a distinct british tradition 
 in evidence the best in liberated furniture including highfidelity 0:high 0:fidelity sets carpets and refrigerators were in good supply in 
 contrast the outdoor cooking facilities were primitive and rather unsanitary our nigerian hosts always made the very best available to 
 us and for this we were very grateful we normally travelled from monday to friday returning to the federal palace 
 hotel lagos at weekends as international observers we probably saw more of nigeria than even the most favoured nigerians i 
 was impressed by the hospitality of the people and particularly by northern nigerians in their presence it was easy to 
 forget that some people are born black and others white our travels to the northern states and areas outside the 
 immediate war zone were justified on the basis of fmg claims that all ibo abandoned property was being administered by 
 state authorities rents collected etc and that property and accumulated rents would be turned back to ibos on their return 
 international observers visited all twelve state administrations and verified the fmg claims these trips were very enjoyable and provided a 
 welcome respite from repetitive visits to refugee camps and war ravaged areas we were able to arrange industrial tours visits 
 to universities government 0:gov 0:ernment research centres and military training establishments one could 
 14 not help but be impressed by the tremendous potential of nigeria s 57 000 000 people and 356 669 
 square miles of varied landscape to understand the civil war in nigeria one must examine nigerian history space does not 
 permit me to do so in this article so let me begin on the 11th of august 1967 when general 
 gowan head of state and commander in chief 0:com 0:mander 0:in 0:chief of the nigerian armed forces ordered the nigerian 
 forces to carry out full scale military operations against colonel ojukwu military governor of the eastern region ojukwu had illegally 
 declared secession of the eastern region on the 30th of may 1967 and named his breakaway region biafra he boasted 
 that he had the strongest army in black africa and no one would stop him from his determination to defend 
 the rights of his people to self preservation however in his declaration of secession he included within the boundaries of 
 biafra the minority peoples of the rivers state and the eastern state estimated at 5 000 000 he gave no 
 thought to the self preservation or the rights of these people who had suffered under ibo domination for years his 
 main interest of course lay in the fact that these two states provided him with access to the sea excellent 
 ports and great wealth as these areas were the oil producing areas oil under the constitution was a federal resource 
 gowan had not anticipated that war would result his army was in disarray 0:dis 0:array most of his officers ibo 
 having absconded to the eastern region he found it necessary to reduce the staff at army headquarters to one officer 
 for each staff section and completely strip all instructional staff from basic training schools in order to officer a hurriedly 
 formed division to counter ojukwu s invasion of the mid western state and his drive on lagos the availability of 
 weapons ammunition and other warlike stores was critical the source of supply almost an unknown factor international observers confer with 
 nigerian commanders in front of colonel ojukwa s residence following the fall of umuahia 
 15 the uk the traditional source of supply was a reluctant supplier as both sides in the conflict were friends 
 of long standing the build up of necessity was slow and the fmg was faced with fighting a war on 
 two fronts the war against the secessionists and the other war the war to maintain law and order in a 
 country of immense size enormous population and great diversity of language and culture beset by want and privation during the 
 first year of the civil war the build up on both sides continued 0:con 0:tinued the biafrans sought to win 
 world recognition as a nation state the price paid in life and destruction of property has been high indeed and 
 to no avail countless initiatives to reach a peaceful settelement have failed the biafrans have demanded as a basis of 
 settlement an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal of fmg forces to the joriginal declared biafran boundaries the fmg have demanded a 
 denouncement of secession a one nigeria policy what about the situation to day the rivers and eastern states have been 
 liberated by federal forces state governments are in operation rehabilitation of these war torn areas is progressing the federal military 
 government have developed their war making potential to a position of overwhelming superiority starting with an army of 8 000 
 almost devoid of officers they now have three divisions in the field with a strength in excess of 1 10 
 000 this i suggest is no mean feat for an underdeveloped 0:under 0:developed country considering the combined armed forces of 
 canada is a lesser figure when the uk has failed to provide the warlike stores the fmg have turned to 
 russia and purchased mig 17s and russian vehicles the country has developed its economic potential to a point where it 
 has been able to follow a pay as you go policy on the other side the secessionists now hold only 
 10 of the land they originally declared to be biafra and only 30 of the ibo state central eastern 0:east 
 0:ern the area held is in a state of siege it is interesting to note that the secessionists have not 
 had a single export since the war began and to draw your own conclusions as to how this war against 
 such uneven odds has been financed the federal leadership lay the blame for the continuation of the war to international 
 interference under the guise of humanitarian relief „ 0 it has been alleged that the federal nigerian government is conducting 
 a war of genocide against the ibo people the primary evidence cited to confirm 0:con 0:firm this allegation is the 
 current starvation in the remaining areas of biafra if starvation does in fact exist responsibility rests with the biafran leadership 
 and not with the fmg ojukwu s cry has been give us guns not butter he has rejected two alternative 
 arrangements to clandestine night flights offered 0:of 0:fered by the nigerian government to get food to the starving the first 
 a land corridor on the grounds that it could be exploited by the federal side for military purposes and the 
 second daylight flights into existing airstrips no reason has been given for rejection of the second alternative however it is 
 a common belief that relief planes forced to fly at night provide cover for the arms carrying planes that come 
 from gabon and the ivory coast jo i j the fmg during two years of civil war has extended itself 
 in agreeing to many proposals by which aid could be given to the secessionists as un secretary general u thant 
 has stated the impediments have not come from lagos to the best of my knowledge lagos has never impeded the 
 flow of goods to civilians and has been only too willing to cooperate with the relief agencies to transport the 
 necessary supplies to the afflicted people i believe there is no justification for continued refusal on the part of biafran 
 leaders to accept aid which is delivered through nigerian territory 
 16 ibo refugee children at a camp in the eastern area gather around international observers or with nigerian inspection and 
 permission there is no doubt in my mind that food is needed but neither refugees or prisoners of war who 
 have recently passed into federal hands show signs of starvation in any event the major responsibility for failure to solve 
 the starvation problem in the past or in the future must be laid at the feet of the biafran leadership 
 the second point cited to support the accusation is the bombing of innocent civilians the nigerian air force has been 
 accused of deliberately bombing civilian centres such as hospitals churches schools and markets in opposition eye witnesses have confirmed that 
 many civilian hospitals 0:hospi 0:tals and schools under biafran control have been converted into army barracks 0:bar 0:racks supply depots 
 or armouries these are considered to be legitimate military targets by the nigerian authorities despite the reports of heavy bombing 
 of the st mary s hospital in umuahia my on the spot investigation 0:investi 0:gation revealed no damage to the 
 buildings by bombing and no bomb craters anywhere within the hospital compound because of the heavy population density in biafra 
 anywhere bombs fall is likely to take a toll of civilian casualties the limited bombing does not confirm the accusation 
 of genocide on the contrary there is much evidence that the accusation of genocide 0:geno 0:cide has no foundation the 
 best available evidence i believe is the fact that an ibo administration has been established by the fmg at enugu 
 to administer that 70 of the central eastern state now in federal hands and its thousands of ibo residents during 
 my tour of duty i talked to hundreds and saw thousands of ibo refugees being cared for by the federal 
 military forces in addition i have visited hundreds of ibo prisoners of war if a policy of genocide were being 
 followed there wouldn t be refugees or prisoners 0:prison 0:ers of war 
 17 many prominent civilian observers have come to the same conclusion they have seen the steps taken to rehabilitate the 
 ibos who manage to escape from the biafran held areas schools markets hospitals and courts have been re opened in 
 liberated areas hundreds of thousands of ibos of all classes are living and working in federal nigeria including civil servants 
 doctors university students traders and domestic servants an estimated 38 000 in lagos alone the fact that they continue to 
 lead unmolested lives in the nation s military headquarters undermines the allegation of genocidal intent the ibo administrator of the 
 central eastern state told me they measured 0:meas 0:ured their success in the rehabilitation of ibo refugees by the number 
 of defections 0:de 0:fections and there have been none many ibos who were previously in support 0:sup 0:port of biafran 
 secession have abandoned the cause and now openly declare for nigeria the civil war in nigeria is really over the 
 secessionists are fighting a lost cause although it is to ojukwu s credit that he has been able to rally 
 his people around him his efforts are suicidal ojukwu s dream empire has become his people s nightmare nations which 
 fail to couple their humanitarian expressions of concern with adequate criticism of the rebel leadership who are responsible for the 
 starvation past or future are doing a disservice to ibos and nigerians alike by encouraging the biafran leaders to hold 
 out for diplomatic recognition suspicions have reached the point in nigeria that political support is in fact the hidden objective 
 of many humanitarian organizations

 warmth and beauty of cyprus from everyone s mind waincon 69 to be held between 30 jan and 22 feb 
 loomed large and frigid in the thoughts of all ranks waincon 69 the advance party departed by road for wainwright 
 on the 28th of jan and were followed two days later by the main body as the troops alighted 0:alight 
 0:ed from the comfort of their buses a chill wind and a temperature of 48 below zero acted to serve 
 warning that all was now in earnest company commanders immediately sought out their cqs for it is common knowledge that 
 where one finds the company stores there too one will discover a comforting 0:com 0:forting cup of hot coffee the 
 cursing and grumbling soon diminished as guides picked up their sub units and led the shivering soldiers to the respective 
 bivouac areas tents began to sprout throughout the battalion area and shortly the unit began to settle in for the 
 night sub unit training commenced with dawn s feeble light and the first of many such demands to pull pole 
 for one week each company practised tent group drills patrolling and cross country marching by day and night sandwiched in

 in exercise bull run which served 0:serv 0:ed well to point up any weaknesses in winter warfare training prior to 
 the commencement of neutral cold a 1 combat group controlled exercise the unit officers attended a tewt during which they 
 examined the lessons to be taught on the forthcoming exercise at the same time the 1 combat group military skills

 0:copter to a cut off position while a and b coys mounted an apc borne assault this lightning operation caught 
 the enemy with their pants down both figuratively and literally and provided a fitting conclusion to waincon 69 however perhaps 
 this concentration is best summed up in a little prayer mumbled through the blue lips of sgt joe walushka now 
 i lay me down to sleep i pray the lord my soul to keep if 1 should die before i

 fortified in order to ensure security for the inhabitants 0:inhabi 0:tants the keys to the gates of these great walled 
 city states were held by the mayor or military commander as a special recognition for signal service to the residents 
 keys were presented to deserving citizens or visitors thus the freedom of the city was granted today s ceremony of

 has served as a rallying point in battle readily identified by each soldier by its own distinctive colours and was 
 periodically trooped through the ranks as in our ceremony yesterday so that no man could mistake his colour on it 
 are emblazoned the names of the battles in which the unit has distinguished itself so that the colour becomes not 
 only a rallying point but also a symbol of the regiment s past achievements and victories there are those today 
 who appear to be unable to understand the value of history and tradition who would have us believe that the 
 ways of the past have served only to lead us to the terrible state of the world today it is 
 true that history is not something to be worshipped for its own sake but if we remember that history and 
 tradition are not static but rather living and growing things we will not fall into this error history and tradition 
 are things to be learned from and built upon so that they continue on into the future as we attempt 
 learning and gaining inspiration from the set backs and victories of the past to build a better world let us 
 pray to god that the events and the ceremonies of this past week end including all its signs and symbols 
 and particularly that in which we are taking part this evening may prove to be a rallying point in the 
 tide of our history as colours have been for their regiments in the tide of battle and we may go 
 on to build on the events of our continuing history a better future and a better world the colours were

 trooping quickly faded info history as the grunts of physical contact echoed from the sports field touch football was in 
 full swing as the companies strove to win a place in the finals for the french grey cup somehow it 
 seemed fitting that the co should take such a lively interest for he himself had organized the first french grey 
 cup play off thirteen years earlier at fort macleod germany b and c companies eventually emerged as the disputants for 
 the silver trophy which was contested on the 30th of october the traditional parade set the stage for the final

 desire to watch 
 32 the grey cup on tv became an over riding factor in the movement plan by dint of their determination 
 this group arrived at dawson creek organized special accommodation and thereby observed the annual classic in complete comfort a credit 
 to patricia initiative one element of the umpire force was airlifted by buffalo on 29 november while the enemy force 
 flew by ci3o hercuies on december ist on arrival at fort st john both parties were greeted by a sea 
 of mud an unprecedented spell of mild weather precluded 0:pre 0:cluded any thoughts of starting this exercise in a traditional 
 winter setting the enemy force platoon commanded by lt al baxter was deployed to sikkani chief airfield and during old 
 hat on a wager this force was able to capture the entire qor orders group in the cold dark of 
 an early morning 0:morn 0:ing this action taught a rather valuable lesson the umpire force was deployed 1 by road 
 to mile 98 and there pitched camp for two days maj don ross capt kris reynolds and lts harry kranenburg 
 and phil jarvis spent their time reconnoitering the exercise area partly by chi 13 voyageur helicopter the number of moose 
 seen at that time convinced the hunters that area was well worth a return visit exercise old hat was predicated 
 on mobility and during the next few days the umpire staff controlled attacks defences withdrawals demolition 0:demoli 0:tion guards and 
 airstrikes while flying in helicopters riding in apcs and on ski doos and also patrolling on foot however the greatest 
 single obstacle to movement was undoubtedly the lack of snow and great areas of mud induced by unwanted chinook conditions 
 in retrospect participation in exercise old hat was beneficial and interesting for the 1 ppcli contingent a new training area 
 was utilized lessons were learned by close observation and many new friends were made many favourable comments were received on 
 the standard of umpiring and this would serve to indicate once again a job well done with professional competence 0:com 
 0:petence the festive season was soon upon us however warm weather and clear skies drove thoughts of a white christmas 
 from everyone s mind sgt l a haley and his tree cutters emerged from the north woods with christmas trees 
 for all and so forced us to realize that we must accept the inevitable the various messes soon blossomed forth 
 with seasonal decorations and the christmas spirit did indeed begin to move in our bosoms a joint officers sergeants at 
 home was held in the home station officers mess where old acquaintances were renewed old stories retold and good wishes 
 for a pleasant season passed the single officers were the surprised recipients of christmas stockings carefully prepared by an underground 
 organization commanded by mrs kay hutchinson most of the young officers were struck dumb on christmas morning pte t j 
 m brauweiller the junior living in soldier led his guests to the men s mess for christmas dinner the co 
 surrounded by his entourage of high priced waiters carved the festive bird and turkey and plum pudding became the order 
 of the day 1969 was properly ushered out with gala balls at all messes while simultaneously the new year was 
 given a rousing welcome at this point we cannot tell what 1970 holds in store for first battalion of one

 37 high altitude physiological study mount logan expedition 1969 by lt h t kranenburg hannibal conquered a roman army but 
 had his forces decimated by severe climatic conditions mao tse tsung evaded the chinese nationalists by leading his troops into 
 16 000 foot mountain passes and also lost heavily to the severity of the local climate lessons that should have 
 been learned from hannibal s expedition did not go unlearned by mao when the chinese invaded sikkim they were well 
 prepared by an acclimatization period prior to the invasion conversely the indians rushed troops up from the plains to meet 
 the chinese onslaught and the sudden exposure to the extreme altitude played havoc with them the indian force suffered more 
 casualties from mountain sickness and the severe cold than from military operations against the chinese this incident caused the western 
 nations to concern themselves with the physiological problems encountered at extreme altitudes and led to extensive research into effective methods 
 to overcome mountain sickness a joint canada united states study into the effects of sudden exposure to high altitudes was 
 begun by the arctic institute of north america in 1967 canadian troops were requested to participate as subjects for the 
 trials two expeditions in 1967 and 1968 were doomed to failure because of adverse weather and administrative difficulties but lessons 
 were learned which contributed greatly to the success of the 1969 expedition more important two drugs namely lasix and diamix 
 were found to aid in counteracting acute mountain sickness the aim of the 1969 expedition was to determine which of 
 the two was the most effective the test site for all three expeditions was selected on the glacial ice field 
 at the 17 000 foot level of mount logan in the st elias mountains yukon territory although the summit of 
 logan towered another 2000 feet above the test site the lower plateau was selected due to its suitability as a 
 landing zone for the light ski equipped aircraft to avoid the administrative snarls encountered in previous years it was decided 
 to airdrop one complete camp into logan high by buffalo and to establish a second self contained unit at base 
 camp this solution functioned 0:func 0:tioned admirably finally after much preparation and a detailed briefing on the nature of the 
 expedition an airlift was conducted on 4 5 july 69 to kluane lake here all participating members of the arctic 
 institute the canadian forces institute of environmental medicine the canadian airborne 0:air 0:borne regiment and the ppcli married up to 
 form the 1969 expedition the arctic institute base camp at mile 1007 alaska highway proved to be a collection of 
 small huts consisting of a commisary kitchen medical laboratory and civilian living quarters situated at the edge of kluane lake 
 and surrounded by mountains it was in a very scenic location if not on a precarious approach route for incoming 
 aircraft skill and a cool attitude were displayed by the buffalo pilots as they lowered their birds onto the postage 
 0:post 0:age stamp size gravel runway from our arrival at kluane the expedition was conducted in three phases the first 
 of which was the preparation for the airdrop on logan high because 0:be 0:cause of adverse weather a one day 
 delay resulted which was put to good

 39 use administering a series cf physiological tests to the car subjects at sea level on 7 july the skies 
 cleared oyer logan high and a successful airdrop was conducted from 1 8 500 feet later the same day the 
 airborne team was shuttled to logan high via the small super charged aircraft equipped to land at extreme altitudes it 
 was arbitrarily decided that this team would test lasix the ineffectiveness of this drug in the acclimatization process was proven 
 as all five team members 0:mem 0:bers contracted acute mountain sickness as characterized by severe headaches 0:head 0:aches nausea vomiting 
 and breathlessness all five subjects were completely 0:com 0:pletely inoperative during their five day stay at logan high one man 
 was medically evacuated to kluane base camp on 8 july and remained in a semicoma 0:semi 0:coma for a forty 
 eight hour period meanwhile at kluane the patricia s in spite of frequently administered medical tests were taking advantage of 
 the land of the midnight sun hiking photography fishing and gold panning held first priority with frequent trips to the 
 nearest pub placing a close second on 10 july as part of a physical fitness programme the fearless five tackled 
 6300 foot sheep mountain but were stopped 500 feet short of the summit by a razor back shale ridge we 
 reached our first conclusion cf the expedition at this point on our return to calgary an attempt would be made 
 to remuster pte madore from infantryman to mountain goat finally on 12 july it was our turn to rotate to 
 logan high following three days of prior treatment with diamix this drug incidentally is not recommended when drinking as it 
 gives beer a very sour and acidic taste when a camp is mentioned mental images of barracks and kitchens cloud 
 the mind logan high had none of these luxuries in 1967 a medical hut was erected but by 1969 it 
 lay buried under twenty feet of snow the camp now consisted of a small plywood hut tent community hall staffed 
 by eight professional mountaineers who had ascended logan the hard way becoming acclimatized in the process there were also two 
 bishop tents soon to be joined by the familiar olive drab arctic tents to arrive at our only luxury the 
 fur lined biffy one had to virtually slide down a precarious ice slide as this was part of the buried 
 1967 establishment the only links with civilization were a fickle radio and a light aircraft for the latter the runway 
 was a gently sloping glacial plateau landings were uphill but on take off if the plane did not make it 
 on its own power the passengers were assured of becoming airborne by going over the top our immediate concern on 
 arrival was pitching camp and making ourselves 0:our 0:selves as comfortable as possible against the onslaught of mountain sickness which 
 we were told to expect this proved to be a tedious task due to the shortage of oxygen at this 
 altitude this completed we turned to our next priority food because our rations had been buried in snow in sub 
 zero temperatures for a week thawing became a major problem especially since the decreased atmosphere had a tendency to cold 
 boil food and water our rations were barely palatable under these circumstances and we resorted to a diet of various 
 condensed liquids by nightfall still under no ill effects we went to bed with spirits at an all time high 
 in the following four days cur team felt very little of the effects of mountain sickness the main problem was 
 the severe shortage of breath on the slightest of physical labour and virtually sleepless nights due to frequent 0:fre 0:quent 
 awakenings from violent dreams in spite of frequently administered medical atrocities morale soared one such test included the injection of 
 a yellow dye into the bloodstream with obvious end results to the pure white 
 40 snow by the second night a spirited sing song of regimental favourites thundered 0:thun 0:dered across the glacial plateau 
 the medics attributed this outburst to high altitude intoxication but we accredited it to extremely high spirits on day three 
 we spent much of our time test firing our personal and automatic weapons closely watched by the doctors who maintained 
 that surely this day we would succumb to the altitude once again we survived and our scores were higher no 
 pun intended than they were at sea level the relay of five took all day to complete this task because 
 walking to the targets to score constituted a major physical effort leaving us gasping for air finally on the 15th 
 our first medical problem arose pte dunlop had not emptied his bladder in four days altitude does have strange effects 
 that night he was evacuated to kluane base camp rumour maintains that he bypassed the traditional welcome home ceremony consisting 
 of a bouquet of flowers a beer and a kiss from the prettiest gal north of calgary and set a 
 world one hundred yard dash record to the outdoor plumbing this was our only medical problem during the entire expedition 
 all tasks completed we returned to kluane minutes ahead of a whiteout 0:white 0:out blizzard which would certainly have left 
 us abandoned on logan for a few more days this group did not pass over the reception the following night 
 a debriefing followed further sea level tests the expedition terminated with an awards night and the wildest party the yukon 
 has had in years each member was awarded with the logan medal a white ribbon with a yellow streak down 
 the centre for our efforts on the mountain we re certain the yellow dye had an effect on the appropriate 
 choice of colours the 1969 expedition was indeed a success physiologically our team had proven that diamox is effective in 
 aiding the body to acclimatize at high l to r pte madore pte penzes pte dunlop cpl swick resting during 
 a climb up sheep mountain in the background is kluane lake and the alaska highway in the middle distance 
 41 altitudes until the normal acclimatization process has taken place further it was proven that wtih this drug the body 
 can overcome the effects of severe mountain sickness the car team quite effectively proved that lasix did not meet the 
 requirements militarily it was proven that again with the aid of diamox troops could perform limited military tasks upon sudden 
 exposure to extreme altitudes on 22 july with arms resembling those of mainliner drug addicts and proudly sporting their logan 
 medals a very high spirited party flew out of kluane by buffalo and settled down for the long trip back

 45 second battalion 1969 proved to be an exciting and worthwhile year for 2 ppcli in north west europe in 
 sports in exercises and socially 2 ppcli can record a profitable 1969 unit courses and sub unit training commenced early 
 in the new year and ran throughout the winter months the sports highlight during the winter was the spectacular performance

 almost 200 square kilometers against green beret parachute assault groups during the exercise 2 ppcli stopped the green berets at 
 of their major targets the battle however was not always clear cut according to cpl tom pelkey cpl pelkey tells 
 an interesting story about the capture and complete interrogation of a german civilian thought to be in the special forces 
 will the truth ever be known one of the most memorable moments of 1969 was the presentation of new colours 
 to 2 ppcli on the sth of may indeed three regular infantry battalions received new colours on the same parade

 ivory tower each company in turn used helicopter to attack lt dan mac lean s guerilla enemy the exercise provided 
 excellent training value and as with most exercises provided many war stories i one such story explains how lt don 
 pippolo courageously captured the enemy force 11 hours before the exercise 0:ex 0:ercise began w o d f mcleod later 
 completely encircled a company group with only 10 men once again well done patricia s during sennalager training 1969 exercise 
 parashot was conducted this is an annual 0:an 0:nual military team parachute and patrol competition sponsored and organized by the 
 rhine army parachute association held on the bth to the 10th of september 1969 the second battalion team from the 
 left cpl ralph hawkins sgt gary lynch capt mary dyck and cpl jerry mccauley placed second in 21 teams competing 
 the second big parade of 1969 took place on the 6th of june in normandy 0:norman 0:dy on the twenty 
 fifth anniversary of the invasion a 100 man 2 ppcli guard commanded by maj bill love won the admiration of 
 all present at the ceremonies few will disagree with the observation that the canadians were the best of all the 
 nations on parade the normandy parade was closely followed by the second major concentration 0:con 0:centration of the year this 
 time held at sennelager the exercises from bth to 28th of june featured range work patrol training and a skill 
 at arms 
 49 competition although 2 ppcli didn t enjoy the excellent weather of the first concentration the training was well worthwhile 
 and provided many valuable lessons many say that the most valuable lesson learned was the need to run battle pt 
 at sennelager and take advantage of the flattest ground in northern germany the skill at arms competition was won by 
 a platoon from b company 0:com 0:pany commanded by lt chris rickett the fact that lt rickett was an rc 
 sigs officer on contact training caused some embarrassment to 2 ppcli subalterns the trophy given to the platoon judged best 
 in basic infantry skills was however well deserved the platoon had cpl barry fraser as platoon sgt and cpls ed 
 major alfie skouris and pete derouscher as section commanders praise must also be given to pte tom ranni for his 
 almost perfect score with the fn c 2 a job well done by all ranks although most of the battalion 
 was at sennelager 2 ppcli was represented at canada 0:can 0:ada week held annually in the town of marberg the 
 patricia s soccer team played an excellent game against the bundeswehr as part of the week s activities cpl john 
 rasmussen the ppcli goal keeper was the star of the game one of the year s most interesting exercises occurred 
 in the normally quiet month of july o cdt gary st arnaud on contact training with 2 ppcli assisted by 
 sgt don mcniven led a platoon dressed in civilian clothing on a raid of the ldsh facilities at fort beausejour 
 the raid was requested by the co ldsh as a check of his security system as it turned out fort 
 beausejour was not secure the 2 ppcli group attacking the gate baffled and almost broke the camp guards it was 
 hard work for the ldsh but fun for the patricias on 12 july the battalion changed command lcol r s 
 peacock cd who had commanded the battalion since july 67 left germany for an appointment as director of cadets at 
 royal roads victoria he handed over to lcol c b snider mc cd who had been dco of the unit 
 prior to a seven month posting to mobile command this change of command signified the beginning of a rotation involving 
 over 300 personnel and their families for the following six months soon after this parade rsm j e duke stone 
 cd left for oakville ontario handing over to rsm j a heyman cd this change is also indicative 0:indi 0:cative 
 of the nature of the rotation in that rsm heyman came from the canadian guards there are now a great 
 many personnel re badging from the queen s own canadian guards and the black watch for example over half of 
 the battalion officers come from regiments and corps other than the ppcli however throughout all the disruptions implied by rotation 
 of families change of command structure and switching regiments the battalion continued training during the second week of august the 
 battalion ran fast water training for the apcs in the weser river near hameln with sgt george sellyeh as senior 
 instructor 244 drivers were qualified without swamping any of the machines this was particularly noteworthy as it was the first 
 time that the unit had swum the newly acquired m 548 cargo apc and the lynx in fast water in 
 the third week of august the brigade battle school exercised all three infantry battalions in patrolling during exercise war axe 
 capt dick robinson leading one platoon and lt garth jonah rc sigs leading the other were aided in locating the 
 enemy by sgt rolf hartman and wo andy aak from the recce platoon who had deployed earlier it was a 
 
 50 worthwhile exercise as all the elements of the battalion involved in patrolling including battalion headquarters were allowed to work 
 as a team on 8 sep major roger beauregard deployed the battalion on a two day shakedown called ex ant 
 hill this was preparation for the series of fall nato exercises that were to follow exercise tomahawk took place from 
 15 26 oct in the munster area it started with a battalion exercise then came under brigade control in a 
 defensive position east of senden on the dortmund ems canal the fifth royal tanks and a belgium unit were our 
 enemy then the brigade moved west to within 15 miles of the dutch border where c coy commanded by maj 
 love conducted an advance in co operation with the strathconas the exercise was tough and the patricias had reason to 
 be proud of their performance 0:per 0:formance but the troops were saddened at the end of it all due to 
 the deaths of two nco s of the armoured defence platoon cpl d a chisholm of westville n s and 
 mcpl h r yeo of prince albert sask were killed when their 106 jeep overturned they were buried in the 
 canadian cemetery at werl the 13th of october found the battalion just south east of hannover about 180 miies from 
 home at the start of exercise marshmellow this exercise was to be very successful for the canadian brigade and specially

 new commanding officer lieutenant colonel c b snider mc cd sive the unit raced westward with a coy commanded by 
 maj larry gollner to the north and c coy to the south crossings over the important leine river were quickly 
 secured and capt jack magee surprised everyone including 0:in 0:cluding the enemy by forging ahead with a company worth of 
 zulu vehicles this part of the exercise ended with the brigade completely crushing the enemy who were holding the stategic 
 springegap it was at this point that the patricias first saw a german panzer battalion streak through with their renowned 
 leopard tanks quite a sight once again the nato exercises proved to be not only very valuable training but good 
 fun as well it is always interesting to work with the rest of the brigade and to be supported by 
 aircraft from four allied countries this was the last nato exercise that the regiment will participate in it is hoped 
 that patricias will always have the chance to keep up their expertise in the new mechanized commando in baden baden 
 and how did the patricias do well there are always many evaluations made after an exercise but there was one 
 in particular that was worthy of note after marshmellow a british intelligence section whose job it was to search refuse 
 dumps for breaches of security reported that it was insufficient 0:insuffici 0:ent to say that the 2 ppcli drank a 
 lot of carlsberg beer it would be more accurate to say that the men were addicted to the stuff ah 
 yes the patricia name lives on in november with rotation in full swing and a junior s part b in 
 progress 0:pro 0:gress the battalion sent a 100 man guard to vimy for remembrance day 
 52 the guard commanded by oc b coy maj gerry wharton paraded with the new colours and were very well 
 received in the town the men did a tour of battle fields in the area before returning to fort macleod 
 in sports the battalion had an active 6 months in the latter half of 1969 both within the unit and 
 in outside competition the most notable success was winning the 4 cmbg soccer league and the montreal cup some might 
 say that it is no longer notable as this is the sixth year that the patricias have not lost a 
 game however the battalion lost cpl john rasmussen 0:ras 0:mussen on rotation back to canada in august ras has played 
 soccer for 33 years 12 of them as the 2nd battalion goal keeper in volleyball 2 ppcli were runners up 
 to the 1 r22er both in the brigade league and the zone 9 championship cpl chris franke of b coy 
 was named best player in the brigade sgt brian harrison the unit peri set an example of excellence by winning 
 the british army trampoline championship in england in addition to this achievement he placed third in the british army during 
 championships 0:champion 0:ships far from any display of excellence but still a lot of fun the unit hosted the first 
 annual clfe rugby clinic one weekend in august participants came from the rcha ldsh and 4 field ambulance with maj 
 dusty miller 0:mil 0:ler and capt stewart from 2 div hq doing the instructing and in a more unusual field 
 four patricias capt mary dyck sgt gary lynch cpl jerry mccauley and cpl ralph hawkins volunteered to compete in ex 
 parashot the baor parachute and patrol exercise the team placed second behind the ist glosters capt doug arril 2 ppcli 
 was also at the meet representing the 3 rgj where he is the exchange officer for three months from august 
 through october the battalion was augmented by 97 militia personnel from across canada many reserve units were represented and it 
 was specially pleasant to see some rocky mountain 0:moun 0:tain rangers and loyal edmontons with which the regiment has close 
 relations 0:re 0:lations in canada they were given a 10 day course on the apc and other equipment by sgt 
 ralph burker before joining the rifle companies for the fall exercises the christmas season saw the second battalion very active 
 socially as any patricia that has served in fort macleod will know the soldiers here throw a party for the 
 orphans of st joseph s kinderheim hemer this year the men hosted 63 kinder and were able to satisfy the 
 christmas wish of each one the party was successful due to the generosity and interest taken by the men and 
 the before party sleuthing done by wo santa boehne the battalion was able to present the orphanage with a tv 
 set and slide projector the dependants party followed the next day with santa arriving by helicopter and apc rides for 
 the children the junior ranks christmas dinner was held on 23rd dec with the officers and sr ncos serving the 
 right spirit was provided by the subalterns 0:subal 0:terns singing carols and then the sergeants led by sgt ed remin 
 and sgt larry davies sang a few selections whose relevance to the christmas season was doubtful to say the least 
 on 19 sep all personnel found out that the new home of the 2ppcli would be winnipeg and some people 
 would be going south to join the new mechanized commando in baden sollingen two hundred and nineteen all ranks including 
 lcol snider as co and maj roger beauregard as dco are looking forward to joining the latter in the summer 
 one hundred others will be staying in europe posted either

 and are anxious to rejoin the rest of the regiment in 1 combat group as we go to press all

 63 united nations military observer group in india pakistan 1968 69 major d s robertson cd the least known of 
 all united nations missions both past and present is the united nations military observer group in india and pakistan unmogip 
 this mission was established in july 1949 and operates on the basis of the karachi agreement being an agreement between 
 the military 0:mili 0:tary representatives of india and pakistan regarding the establishment ol a cease fire line in the states 
 of jammu and kashmir the mission is headed by a chief military observer cmo appointed by the secretary general at 
 present lgen luis tassara of chile the mission 0:mis 0:sion operates as a unit using two channels a the operations 
 section headed by a chief operations officers who is responsible for the tasking and performance of the operations section at 
 unmogip hq and the military observers in the field and at the various unmogip offices b the chief administrative officer 
 cao who is in charge of all administration and logistic support including communications transport 0:trans 0:port supply this service is 
 provided by field service officers a corps of un civil servants the military observers are drawn from the participating nations 
 with canada contributing the largest single group nine military observers and an aircrew of three pilots and five crew complete 
 with a single caribou aircraft 0:air 0:craft australia new zealand denmark norway sweden finland belgium italy chile and uruguay complete 
 the observer group contributing between one and five military observers each to a total of some 40 milobs these 
 64 observers are drawn from regular territorial or reserve components and include several naval officers from new zealand and norway 
 plus swedish air force officers the policy subject to some changes is to rotate a milob to stations on each 
 side of the cease fire line cfl for three months at a time for a total of four stations during 
 a tour of 12 months alternating between stations 0:sta 0:tions in the indian and pakistani occupied areas of jammu and 
 kashmir a total of eight stations are manned 12 months of the year these are from north to south baramula 
 punch rajouri and jammu on the indian side and domel rawalakot kotli and sialkot on the pakistan side the stations 
 at jammu and sialkot are located on the plains and cover by agreement 0:agree 0:ment a portion of the india 
 pakistan border rather than being entirely on the cfl and act chiefly as message centres liaison and supervised crossing for 
 mail supplies and un transport across the border the northern stations at astor in the gilgit territory skardu at the 
 headwaters of the indus river both in the pakistan controlled territory and kargil at 10 000 ft near ladakh on 
 the indian side are open only in the summer season or at least after the snow departs and until the 
 return of the winter snows approximately may to september normal winter station manning is four milobs including an oic station 
 appointed by the cmo most canadian officers can expect such an appointment with three observers during the summer due to 
 the opening and staffing of the northern stations a number of observes are employed h hq or un office appointments 
 a minimum of four observers are required for operations staff employment at the hq and one observer captain is the 
 military assistant to the cmo plus a mobile team of two or more observers who are the cmo s trouble 
 shooters the un office in delhi is also headed by a staff officer military observer as the hq takes advantage 
 of the best climatic changes it is re located twice yearly in rawalpindi pakistan from 01 nov to 01 may 
 and moves to srinagar in the vale of kashmir for the remaining six months thus an soic is appointed for 
 the pindi or srinagar to maintain the office routine assisted by an oic administration for the duration of the hq 
 stay in either location both appointments are usually held by milobs compensatory time off cto of 1 days is granted 
 once per month to an observer on a field station during the winter months it is possible to accumulate cto 
 to a maximum of 12 days with the remaining three days being taken prior to debriefing on departure from the 
 mission chief haunts of the observers are delhi and such points as jaipur the pink city agra of taj mahal 
 fame and southern india depending on both time available and finances these points are winter favourites when the heat of 
 the sub continent is more bearable previously included as a year round oasis was peshawar on the edge of the 
 tribal territory near the north west frontier area of pakistan the united states air force base provided an oasis where 
 milobs could purchase 0:pur 0:chase items at the air force exchange not available through the un post store live in 
 boq s equipped with running hot water see many recent movies and dine on steaks in the officers club this 
 base has since closed thus depriving the observers of this means of escape and has imposed further 0:fur 0:ther restrictions 
 on receipt of competent medical and dental care rawalpindi and srinagar are also visited regularly by field observers particularly when 
 the canadian caribou which services the stations is able to fly the aircraft has a good flying record despite the 
 weather and moun 
 65 tain hazards thanks to the proficiency of the crews srinagar is popular in the summer as the climate is 
 moderate and the observer lives in a houseboat on nagin lake or on dal lake socializes with other observers on 
 cto and may enjoy the hospitality of those observers and field service personnel who have families living in srinagar these 
 families also rotate to pindi when the hq moves families are chiefly those of chilean and italian officers whose governments 
 pay the transportation costs and of scandinavian or australian officers who often extend for an additional year it is not 
 recommended for canadian families due to the living conditions a short stay by canadian wives is normal prior to the 
 observer leaving kashmir and taking a leisurely trip home from peshawar it is relatively easy to take a trip through 
 the khyber pass by bus or to fly to kabul afghanistan sufficient time must be allowed to obtain an afghan 
 visa which they are a bit sticky about the route from pindi via attock fortress on the indus river to 
 peshawar is famed in kipling s writings as the grand trunk road conditions on field stations are somewhat primitive varying 
 from a quonset hut cement block building to the rajah of punch s palace similar to an english country home 
 with a standard local pattern tin roof hot water is heated for showers shaving etc by batmen provided by indian 
 and pakistani armies respectively a typical indian shower is a fire bucket full of cold water with a ladle food 
 is a major concern in most stations the observer eats the regular indian or pakistani food with emphasis on goat 
 mutton chicken all liberally laced with chilis plus chapattis dal rice and other delicacies tinned food beer and a moderate 
 line of necessities including cigarettes toilet tissue ct al are available through the post store outlets in srinagar and pindi 
 payable 0:pay 0:able by us dollar cheques certain items can be obtained in the local bazaars limited to bake shops 
 chiefly in rawalakot in particular we used to partake of madiera cake and macaroon for afternoon tea mind you cleanliness 
 by our standards or any other yardstick is unknown however in order to eat much of this must be overlooked 
 the prime job of the observer is to relieve tension along the cfl a frustrating job with little reward as 
 most of the cases investigated bring a nil result whether you enjoy the mission and sub continent is entirely up 
 to the individual observer and it can be onerous or tolerable dependent solely upon your own attitude the success of 
 a station and the number of cases accepted is also directly 0:direct 0:ly attributable to your personal relationship with the 
 local authority divisional or brigade commander and his staff chiefly the colonel general staff or operations staff and the brigade 
 major by establishing good relations 0:rela 0:tions and participating in the mess activities a semblance of trust evolves which is 
 of great value this is easier to establish on the indian side as the indian army is on active service 
 in kashmir and no officers families are in the area thus mess life is more active the pakistanis on the 
 other hand have their families in azad kashmir free kashmir and being muslim their ladies seldom appear in public thus 
 there is little or no mess activity in accordance with the karachi agreement incidents in the following categories are those 
 which an observer will investigate a firing or use of explosives within 5 miles of the cfl b crossing the 
 cfl 
 66 c entering within 500 yards of the cfl d strengthening of defences continual checking of the disposition of forces 
 and picquet checking round out the observer s prime duties teams on opposing sides of the cfl work to each 
 other in other words if punch on the indian side receives a complaint it will be forwarded by road signals 
 dispatched service or air to rawalakot on the pakistan side for investigation 0:in 0:vestigation with a copy to the hq 
 the investigation when completed by rawalakot is forwarded to the hq for a decision as to whether it is a 
 violation 0:vio 0:lation or not if a violation is awarded the respective army hq is notified as is un hq 
 in new york every investigation requires an observer to proceed to the point of the complaint and in most cases 
 it requires visiting a picquet which is anywhere from an altitude of 6 000 to 10 000 or more feet 
 and many hours climb on foot with only a portion of the journey by jeep or mule thus is exemplified 
 the frustration of the task of trying to find evidence of x number of rifle shots fired a week ago

 possibly the most successful year in the history of the corps after the change from queen s own rifles of

 and wolseley helmets put on an excellent show other cadets took part in the wooden soldier segment which proved to 
 be a crowd pleaser indeed the reviewing officer for this occasion was general em reyno afc cd deputy commander norad 
 the general was most complimentary in his remarks about the three services cadet movement in the calgary area one criterion 
 of the success of our training was the number of master cadets for this year five were successful in this

 79 jamaican cadet visit 1969 cadet major d normand 2554 ppcli cadet corps by reason of having attained the highest 
 results in the master cadet test throughout the province of alberta i was chosen to visit jamica during the summer 
 of 1969 cadet exchange tour to have been selected was indeed an honour and from what i have been told 
 more so by the fact that i was the fifth patricia cadet to have been selected in the last five 
 years with a substantial gift from the regiment as pocket money i started the trip in early july the first 
 stop was canadian forces base petawawa for three weeks we cadets 80 in number were together for training and indoctrination 
 leading 0:lead 0:ing up to our move in three groups to jamaica barbados and trinidad tobaigo we were subjected to 
 talks by many foreign dignitaries who told us about their countries and supplied us with much valuable information petawawa proved 
 to be a good locale to commence our acclimatization at least as far as the temperature was concerned for the 
 week prior to our departure the temperature stayed above 95 the films we were shown the lectures we received and 
 the painstakingly precise talks did not give us a true picture of jamaica it was exotic words cannot describe it 
 it was everything a cadet robinson crusoe could dream of palm trees swaying in the breeze immaculate beaches and beautiful 
 girls the first three days of our twenty day stay were spent in kingston the capitol of jamaica here the 
 soft english accent the different terminology and the easy going life made everything appear quite romantic after conquering our first 
 major difficulty the monetary stystem which is based on the pound sterling we started to enjoy ourselves we frequented such 
 unheard of places as a straw market an open air fruit market as well as a cloth market we moved 
 on after the three days in kingston and began to work our base was a jamaican defence force camp up 
 in the hills here we stayed for two weeks and instructed caribbean cadets in a wide variety of subjects the 
 most difficult task faced by the canadian cadets was to adapt ourselves 0:our 0:selves to the living conditions in comparison 
 to canadian standards the sanitation 0:sani 0:tation facilities were primitive to the least the food was ill prepared and in 
 meagre quantities it was an experience to attempt to exist on rice and curried goat this in conjunction with an 
 uncountable population of ravenous flies bread and water became for us our main staple one avenue of relief was a 
 number of trips to dunns river falls at which time twenty seven canadians could be seen making excellent use of 
 the more modern type washroom on these occasions the concession booth did a brisk business as we stocked up for 
 another two or three day siege believe it or not most managed to hold out on this fare until the 
 next visit our next stay was at montego bay the jet set spot of the caribbean as the largest city 
 in jamaica montego bay serves an ever abundant tourist trade americans and even some canadians were everywhere the prices were 
 higher than in other locations but still quite reasonable by our standards more important was the availability of good quality 
 food and the more modern forms of living conditions 
 80 although jamaica has no liquor laws we saw no intoxicated jamaicans however this was in evidence among the tourists 
 it is not unusual to witness a small child even down to 3 or 4 years of age ordering beer 
 we could only assume it was for their parents very few jamaicans smoke and almost without 0:with 0:out exception not 
 until they are 21 years old the jamaican defence force based on the british army system which appears to be 
 effective in jungle operations is poorly equipped and with low morale the jamaican cadets were much like us in many 
 ways bonds of friendship were easily cultivated and in fact the similarities between us proved to be a pleasant surprise 
 perhaps the commonwealth ties had a bearing on the way we enjoyed each others training and companionship perhaps too it 
 is an indication of modern youth s attempt to bridge todays problems in order to close the gap between future 
 good neighbours the lessons learned throughout our stay in jamaica can only benefit us as canadian youth perhaps some of 
 these may be passed on to some of our associates and reap even future benefits alberta motor association join now

 83 3rd bn the royal green jackets the rifle brigade winter has just started at celle the first snow fell 
 almost a week ago two or three times the wind has veered to the south and then changed quickly 0:quick 
 0:ly back so that the wet snow turned to ice nothing daunted a and b companies are about to set 
 out on foot on a four day exercise the other companies 0:com 0:panies will be running similar exercises before christmas 
 and the whole battalion will be out in the area of the harz mountains in january if there ever was 
 a fashion for relaxing in winter quarters it has changed these days this is also the time of year to 
 look back and see what we have achieved in the past twelve months it has been an astonishingly active year 
 the battalion has trained as far afield as libya and norway b company has also spent three weeks in denmark 
 and still on an international theme we have commanded french gunners and american armour on a n a t o 
 exercise this battalion has spent during the summer almost as much time on exercises as in barracks most of the 
 training has been in our mechanized role and now at the end of our third german summer we do we 
 hope know the ropes however training in a t c s has its drawbacks commanders at all levels radio operators 
 and drivers are kept busy but often for long periods the men in the rifle sections are mere passengers thus 
 the drawbacks 0:draw 0:backs are the difficulty in keeping physically fit and the difficulty in maintaining 0:main 0:taining the basic 
 infantry skills certainly the strenuous dismounted exercises in the past month have helped to balance the scales and we hope 
 our winter 0:win 0:ter programme will complete this process and at the same time prepare us for the strategic reserve 
 the battalion report in the last journal was written in libya each month since then has had its particular theme 
 or activity in july it was b company s visit to denmark they went for three weeks and were the 
 guests of the ist danish life regiment the last time the two regiments met so far as we know was 
 at copenhagen in 1801 however time heals all indeed what lacked in training the training areas seemed restricted in comparison 
 with those we use in germany was amply made up for by the warmth of the hospitality 
 84 august was a month of social activities the highlight was a visit by a party of 67 old contemptibles 
 and their wives led by mr bougourd who had served as a corporal in the rifle brigade the party were 
 taken to see belsen hohne war cemetery and the east german border a unique occasion in their visit was a 
 reunion in the sergeants mess with their old enemies the german ist war old comrades association this apparently was the 
 first time that such an event had ever taken place and was thoroughly 0:thorough 0:ly enjoyed by both sides on 
 their last day the old contemptibles were given lunch in the officers mess here fate intervened in the guise of 
 orders for a practice emergency move out of barracks given as lunch was about to start suddenly there was only 
 one host however lunch and the subsequent programme was able to continue in retrospect we only hope that our visitors 
 enjoyed themselves as much as we enjoyed having them september was mainly spent in preparing for and taking part in 
 exercise 0:exer 0:cise shooting star this exercise was designed to practice co operation with american and french forces who joined 
 the battalion to make up a composite 0:com 0:posite battle group to make this polyglot force operate effectively took a 
 good deal of hard work and tact however the exercise was a great success and allied solidarity was further confirmed 
 at the subsequent parties it was at one of these that the french commandant after noticing the striking features of 
 a number of regimental officers observed to colonel alexander sinclair that he exemplified le nez dv green jackets also in 
 september we were delighted to welcome our colonel commandant 0:com 0:mandant and lady fyffe the visit was remarkable for the 
 tightly packed programme which allowed general fyffe to meet officers and senior ranks both socially and at work early in 
 october colonel alexander sinclair handed over command to colonel glover the latter arrived in time for a series of dismounted 
 exercises the first two were designed to prepare us for our training in norway it was as well that we 
 had taken these precautions the exercise area in norway was similar to northern scotland and the weather was appalling drenching 
 rain and a bitter wind in such conditions we re learnt the lessons of having to operate with the minimum 
 number of vehicles and having to carry our comforts on our backs the riflemen though continuously cold and wet acquitted 
 themselves well exposure was the main enemy and it was interesting to discover we had fewer casualties than the norwegians 
 themselves altogether the exercise if not entirely enjoyable what soldier enjoys being cold and wet was valuable 0:valu 0:able it 
 certainly demonstrated that not all warfare can be waged from the relative comfort of a p c s since our 
 return from norway we have been planning our training for the remainder of our stay in germany there will be 
 little time for individual 0:individ 0:ual training during the summer at tidworth or in the following winter in the united 
 nations force in cyprus so we will make the best use of the next five months there is a lot

 neil nuefield mickey yost the above executive was elected on the 31st of january 1969 and will administer edmonton branch 
 business for the next two years 1969 and 1970 inclusive the executive of the edmonton branch met on january 14 
 1970 to discuss tentative scheduling of branch activities for the current year president 0:presi 0:dent joe dunn noted that branch 
 progress and growth in 1969 was most encouraging he stated that increased membership and good attendance at general meetings is 
 an indication that former members of the regiment are desirous to become affiliated with the association commenting on the favourable 
 experience enjoyed by the branch in 1969 president dunn paid tribute to those keen and loyal patricias i e andy 
 mills dune macdonnell don gower sammy campbell etc who in 1965 had the enthusiasm and foresight to re activate the 
 edmonton branch the highlight of 1969 activity was the frezenberg parade and ceremony held on the 10th of may with 
 the assistance of several influential members 0:mem 0:bers of the regiment in calgary the edmonton branch was graciously supplied 0:sup 
 0:plied with the services of an honour guard and band from the loyal edmonton 0:ed 0:monton regiment 3 ppcli the 
 regimental camp flag and the canadian flag were borne proudly by neil nuefield and mickey yost respectively and led the 
 parade from city hall through jasper avenue to the cenotaph where the service was held the return route was again 
 via jasper avenue and at 101 street alex rennie a frezenberg veteran took the salute honouring 0:hon 0:ouring alex rennie 
 on the saluting base was colonel owen browne and his worship mayor ivor dent of edmonton following the parade and 
 ceremony 0:cere 0:mony branch members and their families entertained invited guests and dignitaries at the leonforte building at griesbach barracks 
 during this reception each branch member participating in the parade received a regimental 0:regi 0:mental lapel pin on behalf of 
 the branch newspaper radio and television stations gave excellent coverage to the parade and were emphatic in commenting that the 
 mayor s late arrival did not in any way deter the patricias from moving their parade precisely on schedule it 
 is fortunate however that the media did not witness joe dunn pleading with the honour guard to slope arms prior 
 to the march off this confrontation provided much comic relief during post parade bantering and president dunns contribution to refreshment 
 bar profits was appreciated by all many kind words and plaudits were received by branch members for their efforts and 
 success in the parade and ceremony however we primarily 0:primar 0:ily felt privileged that we were allowed the opportunity to 
 pay tribute and respect to our fallen comrades the edmonton branch was well represented in calgary for the trooping the 
 colour ceremony on the 13th of september and those attending are sincere in their thanks for the hospitality extended by 
 the regiment following the national association meeting on sunday the 14th of september the edmonton branch was allowed the privilege 
 of hosting 
 100 on the 10th of may 1969 the edmonton branch proudly marched to the city s cenataph 0:cena 0:taph to 
 do honour on the occasion of the 54th anniversary of the battle of frezenberg 0:frezen 0:berg carrying the national flag 
 of canada is mickey yost and the regimental camp flag was carried by neil nuefeld the marching troops of the 
 branch are led by mr joe dunn president the edmonton branch ppcli association pays its respects on the occasion of 
 the 54th anniversary of the battle of frezenberg 
 101 members of the regiment and association to a spot of refreshment prior to their departure for home many members 
 were confronted with immediate plane and train schedules nevertheless they did drop in for a short visit to the better 
 ole and this courtesy was appreciated in 1970 the branch will seek permission guidance and assistance from the regiment and 
 the association on the matter of purchasing and or designing 0:design 0:ing an association flag this flag will be for 
 display and inspiration at branch meetings and parades it is agreed that much thought and discussion will be necessary before 
 this project will become a reality during 1969 edmonton branch membership increased to 10 honourary life members 41 regular members 
 and 12 serving members the total membership 0:mem 0:bership of the edmonton branch in 1969 is 63 which is an 
 increase of 33 over 1968 it is hoped that this membership increase will continue in 1970 tentative plans are being 
 made for edmonton branch representation to the national association meeting in winnipeg in september 1970 if no one else muzz 
 kozak and joe dunn will be there to pay off their membership wager to ernie dodd the edmonton branch mourns

 112 ottawa branch we once again are proud to announce to all patriciadom that the ottawans are in good spirits 
 and barely solvent if the treasurer absconded 0:abscond 0:ed with the entire proceeds of the bank account it would not 
 even be considered 0:con 0:sidered petty larceny the most outstanding branch legislation which has been enacted during this year allows 
 all world war i members of our branch of the association to be paid up life members of our branch 
 effective 1 january 1969 on 8 april 1969 jim stone turned over the office of president to dick whitmore an 
 original this annual meeting was held in concert with a social get together and buffet luncheon at the r c 
 a f officers mess on gloucester street ottawa another outstanding social event was our fall banquet which was held on 
 12 november at the transport officers mess brigadier general george brown then colonel was our guest speaker and he shared 
 some interesting reminiscences about his time with the ppcli dick whitmore glen bannerman and gault donaldson laid a wreath at 
 the national cenotaph on the 11th november on behalf of the regimental association we are in a unique position in 
 ottawa because the serving members generously invite their association brothers to mess functions in the various establishments in the city 
 such a harmonious relationship allows us to keep informed about regimental news and events two of our branch stalwarts have 
 departed from ottawa bill stirling who has been posted to mobile command headquarters and bill dawson who has retired to 
 thunder bay their enthusiasm will be missed our officers for the year 1969 were honorary president colonel s h hill

 1969 was a quiet year for our branch with our members scattered throughout england we seldom get together our annual 
 luncheon was again held on the bth of may to commemorate the battle of frezenberg 1915 twenty one of us 
 including four wives sat down to dine in the victory club marble arch very obviously missing because of poor health 
 were colonel hetherington and h f paddy o connell it is the first annual luncheon paddy has missed in many 
 years of great pleasure to our members was the opportunity to welcome brigadier j a de lalanne and n g 
 m lougheed from canada and mr andr e verstraete from ypres truly a memorable gathering the agenda called for us 
 to hold the annual general meeting immediately 0:immedi 0:ately prior to lunch but this had to be postponed for a 
 later gathering with the secretary delayed by a train failure and the president and some other members arriving late due 
 to other transportation problems the branch business was put off and we proceeded to enjoy our luncheon joe neller was 
 escorted by his son in law to arras vimy and ypres in june and the branch secretary was able to 
 travel with them this was joe s first visit to france and belgium since he left there with the regiment 
 at the end of the first great war after a night in arras the group travelled to vimy and enjoyed 
 a picnic lunch in a spot where possibly quite a number of patricias had spent time in the trenches 52 
 years before from vimy the journey more along the lines of a pilgrimage continued through lens and armentieres enroute to 
 ypres many places of interest in and around ypres were visited not the least of which was the patricia 
 115 memorial at frezenberg in ypres they were entertained by mr and mrs verstraete and also attended a burgermeister s 
 reception in the town hall mr a deham the burgermeister was made an honourary life member of the ppcli association 
 in 1968 at the reception was a party of household cavalry with the oldest guardsman having first enlisted in 1903 
 joe neller having enlisted in 1900 became the senior soldier present and was therefore accorded yip treatment we regret that 
 on the last day of 1969 we learned of the passing earlier in december of 696295 david reid at thorpe
