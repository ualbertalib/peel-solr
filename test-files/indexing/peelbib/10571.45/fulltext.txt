 1 message from the colonel of the regiment major general g g brown ostj cd another challenging and productive year 
 for the regiment 0:regi 0:ment has gone by and the regiment rides high i have visited all battalions and the 
 battle school and have been most impressed with the morale training discipline enthusiasm and most important regimental spirit which are 
 all of the highest order our colonel in chief lady patricia continues to inspire us all with her interest dedication 
 and her abundant energy as she visits with us at work and at play in march despite a dreadful cold 
 she visited her patricia s of first battalion on exercise sovereign viking on ellsmere island 0:is 0:land she saw installations 
 at resolute bay went to little ellsmere to visit a cominco mine above and below ground and followed that up 
 by visiting all patricia s participating on a high arctic patrol either on the trail or in their tent groups 
 while the wind chill hovered at 113 degrees fahrenheit i was warmed by her keen interest as well as the 
 great affection in which she is held by her patricia s she presided at a retirement dinner in ottawa with 
 regular and retired patricia s before her high arctic visit and her second battalion after it was a great pleasure 
 for me to see her recognize the service of our comrades majors bill love dave snowball fred yokes dick wallace 
 and captain paddy collins and present them with their retirement gifts 2 ppcli put on a first class show as 
 her farewell to canada as i write this the finishing touches are being put on another of her firsts a 
 visit to exercise ric a dam doo a regimental familiarization exercise for our new officers this has been a banner 
 year for promotions good talent and ability have been recognized with promotions to junior nco rank to senior nco to 
 warrant officer and to subaltern field officer and general officer the regiment is providing fine leaders and gaining the recognition 
 0:recog 0:nition it deserves next july i will be stepping down and giving to another the great privilege and honour 
 of being your colonel this will bring to an end thirty seven years of continuous service to our regiment and 
 a total of forty five years of militia and active service to the canadian army almost two of those years 
 was with the loyal edmonton regiment 0:regi 0:ment now 4 ppcli in italy and northwest europe during world war 11 
 the canadian army has been very good to me and i shall always be most grateful for the privilege of 
 serving i believe the greatest and by far the most outstanding reward that i have received has been to know 
 the canadian soldier in war and peace particularly the infantry man the product of our regimental system he is a 
 wonderful brave kind tough compassionate caring citizen who most of the time holds his true feelings under a rough exterior 
 in other words a superb fighting man a patricia i hope to visit all of you in the coming months 
 and thank you personally in the meantime and if i don t see you please accept my everlasting gratitude and 
 admiration

 editor s note albert e carson joined the ppcli in 1940 following basic training this account was presented by his 
 wife mrs alma carson following his death in 1980 it is published to give an insight of the more personal 
 thoughts and experiences of the ordinary soldier during that period of our regiment s history i enlisted january 25 1940 
 at fort osborne barracks winnipeg while training in winnipeg my home away from home was at 862 warsaw avenue winnipeg 
 with a company of first division reinforcements about may 12 1940 we went aboard the duchess of bedford at halifax 
 one other troopship in the convoy our escort was the british battleship the revenge the ocean voyage was a wonderful 
 experience i was taken on strength of the field battalion p p c l i at cove barracks england on 
 may 22 1940 we had arrived at liverpool about may 20th during the battle of britain in the summer of 
 1940 we kept moving about to many different places first in a park near oxford then to kettering northampton 0:nor 
 0:thampton back to cove surrey then three weeks along the south coast east of brighton woodingdean to rottingdean the beauty 
 of the english gardens and fields in summer i shall always remember for most of 1941 we were in or 
 near godstone surrey but also at westerham kent and spent some time at brighton on my leaves i paid memorable 
 visits to london stratford on avon edinburgh 0:edin 0:burgh glasgow and the trossach district loch katrine in scotland also in 
 scotland i visited the lumgair homes at carnoustie at loughton near london i had several visits with members of the 
 simmons family in london i purchased a violin from w e hill and sons on bond street on a few 
 occasions i played this violin for the troops another favorite spot in london for me was foyles book store on 
 charing cross road on march 17 her birthday we had a visit from the gracious and beautiful lady who gave 
 her name to our regiment princess patricia of connaught she came to see us again several times we spent most 
 of 1942 in sussex on the downs near brighton at woodingdean at hampton park near polegate 0:pole 0:gate and at 
 eastbourne on the evening of august 13 1942 we kept watch along the sussex coast for returning survivors of the 
 raid on dieppe from march to may 1943 we were at seaford sussex preparing to leave england in early june 
 of 1943 we at last bade farewell to the south of england and went by train to hamilton in scotland 
 near glasgow about june 20 we were aboard the langibby castle in a great convoy of ships we sailed far 
 west out in the atlantic then far away to the south to tropical latitudes afterthatwesailed northeasttogibralter about july 8 1943 
 we passed gibralter passing the shores of africa to the south on july 9 1943 we sailed slowly to the 
 east a great number of ships spread out over the sea on july 9 evening we went north toward sicily 
 12 30 a m july 10 we climbed down from the ship into our assault craft the wind was very 
 strong and the sea rough we continued north toward the beaches of sicily at dawn july 10 we swept in 
 on the coast of sicily just west of pachino the first canadian division was now a unit of the british 
 eighth army under montgomery while aboard ship i was transferred from d rifle company to the intelligence section at battalion 
 headquarters the work of the i section is mostly caring forthings like maps and messages and most of all to 
 know where everybody is and what is going on all the time among those on my assault craft were lt 
 col lindsay who was commanding officer of the p p c l i another was corporal drew who like myself 
 was a member of the i section two british soldiers who were bth army signallers were on the craft they 
 were next to me in the boat so i could talk to them we were very soon inland from the 
 beaches by a few hundred yards the italian coast guard troops seemed completely surprised by the attack and offered little 
 resistance on the evening of july 10 i was given the task of escorting a group of italian prisoners back 
 to the beaches my ability to speak a little italian thus became useful immediately it was late morning 0:morn 0:ing 
 on july 11 when i was at last able to leave the beach area and make my way forward to 
 try to catch up with the p p c l i making my way forward alone i was famished and 
 thirsty under the hot sun i stopped at a wretched hut such a dwelling as the very poorest sicillians had 
 as a place in which to live at the door of the hut there was a woman and two small 
 children all three clothed in rags i said to her making my best effort with italian i o ho fame 
 i have hunger she gave me a piece of black bread 
 3 and a glass of wine all my life i have never been more grateful for a kindness shown by 
 late afternoon of july 11 1 had rejoined my own unit we made our way slowly northward toward leonforte everyday 
 was equally hot the sun blazing down from a cloudless sky lt smith the officer commanding our intelligence section was 
 wounded on about july 18 his wounds were severe and i do not believe that he rejoined the p p 
 c l i i had enjoyed working with him he had interviewed me aboard the langibby castle to request my 
 transfer to his section my work included gaining information re casualties this brought me in close touch with the first 
 aid men and in particular with dr fairfield our medical officer among the p p c l i officers lt 
 smith and dr fairfield were two whose friendship i especially valued advancing east from leonforte my friend winston dobson fell 
 in the field during an attack the night of july 22 1 had known him for three years in england 
 and i kept up a correspondence with his parents after the war our advance was stopped for nearly a week 
 at agira here i became acquainted with a few sicilian families which gave me a chance to improve my spoken 
 italian one family had an old violin they were delighted when i was able to tune it well enough to 
 play a few pieces it was near leonforte that i picked up in a field a letter written by a 
 very young german girl about ten years old i would estimate by the handwriting i remember the first line of 
 her letter it read ich habe mit grosser freude deinen geliebten brief erhalten i have with great joy received your 
 dear letter the letter was addressed to her brother a soldier her simple child like words of affection reminded me 
 that the strain of warfare and separation were just as great for the families of german soldiers as for my 
 own family and the families of my comrades from agira we made out way eastward to the western slopes of 
 mount etna after a few days we made our way to a rest camp area about sixty miles or more 
 south west of catania our part of the sicilian campaign had ended when we reached mount etna i believe the 
 nearest town to our rest camp was a village called milletelo the best part of our stay there were the 
 few trips to beaches near catania where we could swim in the mediterranean sea note erhalten may not be the 
 correct word september 3rd and 4th 1943 it was time to have a look at italy so we made a 
 dash across the messina strait to reggio di calabria on the toe of italy there were no enemy troops to 
 be seen when we landed we made our way very slowly through rugged mountain country all bridges being blown out 
 in a few days we arrived at a small town i believe it was cittanuova i was becoming ill with 
 hepatitis jaundice and i had to be evacuated back to hospital in sicily i went back by air ambulance that 
 is in an old two engine british bomber converted to an ambulance 0:ambu 0:lance plane my one week stay in 
 hospital was very pleasant the hospital had been an italian hospital it was just north of catania on the lower 
 slope of mount etna i was then sent for three weeks to a rest camp at the south end of 
 catania where i could enjoy swimming in the sea a fast trip by night from syracuse to taranto in a 
 small ship brought me back to italy i remained for about a week at 4 canadian base reinforcement group camp 
 near taranto and was able to see a little of that city i attended a service one sunday at the 
 british eighth army base at taranto it would be late october of 1943 when i rejoined the p p c 
 l i the patricias were out of the front line and camped at busso near cam pobasso when i rejoined 
 them very soon we were moving north to continue the arduous campaign along the adriatic coastal plain toward ortona i 
 recall the crossing of the moro and sangro rivers on christmas day we were about a mile south of ortona 
 about two weeks later we had established a line about a mile north of ortona and extending west to the 
 mountains 0:moun 0:tains for a time this became a sort of fixed winter line with no further advance to the 
 north some soldiers were given five day passes for a holiday at bari i was one of the lucky ones 
 and so i came to know bari better than any other italian city i became acquainted with some italians at 
 bari and ortona this gave me a chance to improve my ability to speak their language i think ortona would 
 have been a very nice town in more peaceful times i expect they have it all rebuilt long before now 
 i recall one night north of ortona when four or five men of our scouts and snipers section went forward 
 in the darkness and rescued a wounded soldier from the very doorstep of the enemy line they returned to safely 
 the wounded man recovered 0:reco 0:vered i believe it was some time in april that the first canadian division was 
 withdrawn from the line north of ortona it may have been in march for a week or two we were 
 encamped near the adriatic quite some distance south of ortona then we moved again to a camp north west of 
 campobasso during this time i transferred from my work with battalion headquarters 0:head 0:quarters and rejoined d company this was 
 the company 0:com 0:pany i had served with in england during the last days of april i was becoming ill 
 with malaria on may 1 1944 it became necessary for me to leave the p p c l i in 
 the field i was at a field dressing station in campobasso for a week receiving treatment for the malaria next 
 i stopped one night only at a hospital near caserta after this i went to the canadian x 8 camp 
 at avolino near naples my stay at avolino for about a month until about june 20 was perhaps the most 
 enjoyable part of my italian journey i would walk through the town during the afternoons and evenings talking to many 
 different people and bartering with the shopkeepers at one house there was a violin which i played at another house 
 there was a small girl her name was maria greco one day little maria said to me i o voglio 
 avere dente bianchi come i vostri i wish to have teeth white like the yours and she wanted to know 
 if i could find a tooth brush for her she danced with joy when i brought her a new tooth 
 brush i had found it by digging down into my kit bag the time for me to leave italy had 
 now arrived near the end of june i made the short journey to naples in an army truck all of 
 those in the truck on their way back to england we went directly to the dock area on the beautiful 
 bay of naples and went aboard the french cruiser la gloire a swift passage by night across the mediterranean and 
 we arrived at oran in the morning my stay on the shore of north africa was to last for only 
 four hours toward evening we went aboard the american liner the monarch of bermuda this was truly a luxury ship 
 it had been used as a holiday cruise vessel before the war the journey to england in fine summer weather 
 was very enjoyable and so on a fine summer day in july 1944 our ship sailed into liverpool harbour and 
 i saw the green fields of england before me once more i had been in england for more than three 
 years may 1940 until june 1943 and so coming back to england was just like coming home i spent only 
 a few days at a reception camp nearwitley this camp was just up the hill through the trees above 
 4 haslemere road i was becoming ill with malaria again so i had to go into hospital first to a 
 hospital near hindhead then to another hospital not far from fleet and godstone i was able to leave the hospital 
 one afternoon and i had a nice walk through the godstone area where we had been in 1941 on leaving 
 hospital instead of sending me to the first canadian infantry base the powers that be misdirected me to a base 
 camp for machine gun regiments in this way i arrived at otley yorkshire otley is a very lovely town with 
 a river flowing by and lots of park areas they did not seem to know what to do with me 
 at the camp so i simply kept out of the way most of the time by spending afternoons and evenings 
 in the town i was listed at camp headquarters as misdirected personnel with no documents 0:docu 0:ments next they sent 
 me to the main camp at witley where i was still misdirected personnel after a brief stay at witley i 
 at last was sent to the base camp for the p p c l i at aldershot where my papers 
 or documents caught up with me after a brief stay with the patricias at aldershot my next move was to 
 no 1 canadian repatriation camp at thursley surrey here i was to stay until my repatriation to canada in may 
 1945 it would be either october or november 1944 when i arrived at the camp at thursley there came an 
 evening in about late october or november when i made my way to chichester hall at witley i believe it 
 was a saturday evening the hall was crowded i just waited inside the door for a time presently i caught 
 sight of a tall slender girl in the midst of the crowd i made my way through the crowd to 
 her and said simply would you care to dance please this was the beginning 0:begin 0:ning of thefriendship of alma 
 grace long and myself we passed the evening together and when the dancing ended we walked along the quiet road 
 to her home pine view on haslemere road one day when i was in guildford i was able to buy 
 a bicycle an old one but in quite good shape once i got going with the bicycle i came to 
 enjoy riding along the winding roads in the district up and down hill there were many interesting villages within easy 
 riding distance 0:dis 0:tance some of them were godalming witley milford haslemere hindhead churt and thursley and so in this 
 very lovely part of western surrey the last few months of my stay in england passed by these were the 
 months of december 1944 until early may 1945 about may 7th or bth was the day i was to leave 
 thursley to go to liverpool the evening before i left i was able to call to see alma at liverpool 
 i went aboard the duchess of bedford the same ship that had brought me across the atlantic from canada five 
 years earlier i arrived home about may 20th it was norman who came by car to meet me when i 
 came out on the bus from winnipeg my dad my mother and wilma were at home to greet me when 
 i arrived with norman at our old farm home four miles south west of thornhill manitoba i had thirty days 
 leave at home during july and august i cared for the barracks vegetable garden at fort osborne barracks in winnipeg 
 on september fourth i received my discharge i had completed five years seven months and eleven days service with the

 exciting training involved extensive heliborne operations featuring platoon raids against obsolete sam sites supported 0:sup 0:ported by cobra gunships familiarization 
 training with our american counterparts included a defensive live fire exercise using their weapons skiing on us style bangie boards 
 and a chinook jump for those who were para qualified the exchange was an unqualified success reflections of c rations

 fall pcf cycle under the trained eyes of sgts white and bynkoski our soldiers soon became proficient in the art 
 of handling avgps the course involved driver maintenance road moves cross country driving and tactical employment of the avgp the

 all in all a very interesting exciting and satisfactory year for ranger company patrols we moved by helicopter and conducted 
 two live fire exercises the weather averaged a comfortable 56 c with a low of 90 c there was one 
 white out which stranded a patrol for 48 hours in their vehicles but all survived the highlight of the exercise 
 was the visit by our colonel in chief the countess mountbatten of burma along with the colonel of the regiment 
 and the regimental 0:regimen 0:tal major oh yes the co and rsm were there also the colonel in chief visited 
 the support base and the local area then flew to meet the deployed patrol in their bivouac area she met 
 and spoke with each member of the patrol an event which we shall all remember trivia comer maj brigden ate

 fishing was superb c coy therefore was there during the off season when even the inuit stayed home in fact 
 after drilling through nine feet of ice it was found that the inuits were not the only ones that stayed

 firm base quickly set up in several abandoned and dilapidated buildings after many days of hard work in fact maj

 9 adventure training talk about a year one adventure after another with sgt l shot a moose here last fall 
 mckinnon as chief instructor the coy deployed to the james river area for a week of learning how to survive 
 in the bush there was water aplenty both from the river and the sky at least for the first 48 
 hours sgtßuchanon ably instructed in the use of the survival fishing kit confidently maintaining that everyone would have lots offish 
 to eat and then failed to catch anything himself despite his custom fishing tackle the first day was spent living 
 under hoochies in the base area after a nights rest the coy then lined up to be searched each man 
 was permitted basic clothing web equipment ten matches a candle 20 cigarettes and an improvised weapon upon completion of the 
 search the oc and csm were looking at nearly 1000 contraband cigarettes tins of corned beef untold varieties of packet 
 soups coffee milk and sugar and enough money for both to retire in comfort for the survivors success came in 
 many different forms pte coulson discovered a fondness for frogs legs 6 pairs pte watson and pte radcliffe caught a 
 fish apiece and numerous squirrels barely escaped with their lives the majority however went hungry but not disillusioned when the 
 exercise ended two and a half days later most agreed that they learned something if only that fish and game 
 don t come easy no matter how hungry you are another excellent year for the green machine comes to a 
 close combat support company another year has passed and it seemed that the only time the coy was together was 
 during co s parades and the start of the pcf cycle our teams of specialists were involved in practically every 
 major exercise as well as supporting the rifle companies in all aspects of individual and collective training the year kicked

 hard worked hard and played hard at the end of it all we were the elite track drivers and tow

 there was more to being a pioneer than the ability to grow a beard and if you are still a 
 non believer ask mcpl skibinsky he s been trying to grow his for a year now seriously the pioneer course 
 is an extensive theoretical 0:theoreti 0:cal and practical course that encompasses a myriad of minor engineering tasks the candidates on

 success with a lot of study hard work and an ability to take a lot of ribbing about the fuzz

 actual trek of mortar platoon down the south nahanni river under the auspices of csm cbt sp coy mwo hamilton 
 the platoon was put through a gruelling training program in preparation for the mighty waters of the nahanni workup commenced 
 with the intricacies of the canoe and paddle on the calms of the ghost river reservoir we then proceeded to 
 faster water on the bow and north saskatchewan 0:sas 0:katchewan rivers where the members of the platoon got their feet 
 and other parts of their anatomy wet with the conquest of these major alberta rivers tucked away it was on 
 to the nahanni although our trek started off slow it did not take long before we were into the fierce 
 waters of the nahanni after a portage around virginia falls and a few days rest we were ready to attack 
 the much faster water of the lower nahanni winding downward the river turned and twisted like a spiral staircase our 
 boys showed deft control throughout the voyage down this unrelenting river only one canoe capsized the operators of which shall 
 remain a mystery if only to protect their egos the fishing along the way was excellent and quite a few 
 trout and grayling were expertly extracted from these northern waters just ask our leader capt tony i ll catch one

 11 administrative company it was one of those years seemingly more than enough support to provide with not enough time 
 nor enough personnel to meet our commitments however adm coy survived even if we had to knit spare parts and 
 personnel in order to do so a hectic fall was spent preparing the battalion for the ordnance engineering inspection getting 
 ready for our portion of the commander s staff inspection training our new oc and 2ic major liggett and capt 
 novokowsky supporting the pcf courses and retraining our new oc and 2ic we all thought that the fall would never 
 end and that long awaited christmas break would never arrive which would allow the coy to revive the wounded send 
 the oc for a hair transplant and restock his diovol allow maint pi to feed themselves something other than grease 
 and oil and the adjt to almost empty his in basket after our well deserved rest the coy deployed to 
 that great ice box of alberta camp wainwright to support the battalion during our winter battle school due to the 
 extreme cold temperatures the majority of the coy not employed in the luxury areas fed by the herman nelsons could 
 be found providing expert advice to those lucky enough to be so employed the battalion accomplished its aim despite the 
 harsh conditions but only through the excellent support and hard work of adm coy on return to calgary the coy 
 was again spread through the battalion and across the country supporting the other coys it seemed that the only time 
 we were complete as a coy was while on battalion exercises however we persevered got that term from a zipperhead 
 and were able to repair and replenish the battalion stocks just in time for waincon after a very successful concentration 
 and finally getting the oc and 2ic trained we returned to calgary only to find out that the oc was 
 posted to gagetown and the 2ic was promoted and cross posted to a coy my god will this cycle never 
 cease all in all the year was very demanding and very satisfying adm coy came through when required and successfully

 13 ex rapier thrust 82 ex rapier thrust 82 saw 1 ppcli in wainwright this year but not as part 
 of the brigade we conducted our own battle school with a lot of excellent training and hard work the most 
 memorable thing of the exercise has to be the extreme cold the average temperature throughout the period was close to 
 40 c and one day s training was even cancelled due to the wind chill factor the actual brigade exercise 
 was cut short by two days because of the weather the battalion fared well under the conditions with few casualties 
 training was demanding but educational 0:educa 0:tional and there is no question that the soldiers learned the importance of good 
 tent routine we were a bit of an international force this year with a us coy b coy 4 9 
 infantry battalion manchu a norwegian platoon and of course our british exchange officer capt alan carroll still recovering from an 
 appendectomy 0:appen 0:dectomy it felt even colder to all of them the exchange units fitted in well with the battalion 
 and there was a considerable exchange of views and many lessons were learned by all concerned there were four activities 
 in the battle school that combined most of the training and knowledge required to operate in winter conditions a long 
 range patrol advance to contact helicopter assault and a minefield breech tow live fire activities were conducted demonstrating 0:de 0:monstrating 
 that the platoons were well trained and could perform well in adverse conditions all in all it was a memorable 
 exercise with many lessons learned international friends made and poor sleep due to the cold the most remarkable thing of 
 the exercise is that our vehicles made it up to wainwright and back again regimental day 17 march 1982 on 
 this year s regimental day festivities the companies found themselves competing for three trophies tug o war 0:tug 0:o 0:war 
 european handball and the old favourite broom i 100 0:broom 0:i 0:100 throughout the day no one company dominated the 
 events with the following overall winners tug o war a company european handball b company broom i 100 combat support 
 company however due to a scoring system that many of us suspected was devised by major ethell it was his 
 boys in a company that received the aggregate trophy as overall winners of the inter company competitions after the protests 
 of oc b major bragdon and oc combat support captain mcdonald had died down with oc c coy capt austdal 
 either chuckling or remaining unusually 0:unusu 0:ally solemn in the background the highlights of the day and every regimental day 
 for that matter was finally upon us the officers versus senior ncos broom i 100 game since the big hockey 
 match two months earlier the officers had been begging to get another shot at the senior ncos you see any 
 sport where these two teams could be pitted against one another was is always will be a big hit with 
 our co lcol ray crabbe so after having lost the hockey game to the senior ncos by the narrowest of 
 margins it was only fitting that the field of battle for a rematch should be the highlight of the year 
 next to the french grey cup the annual broom i 100 fiasco right from the start we knew this was 
 going to be a different contest altogether for the first time in recorded history the rules were going to be 
 enforced no more of that stuff that vcs and dsos are made of no more flying tackles no more soccer 
 football murderball mixup just straight up honest checking something we had to explain to the senior ncos and this is 
 where their wisdom stepped in knowing that their hopes were slim in a game where ball control was the key 
 they enlisted the support of the junior ranks on the sidelines to haul nearby officers off the playing field throughout 
 the entire game but alas despite this underhanded support the senior ncos lost 1 0 and it was swo connell 
 who had to graciously receive the highly coveted trophy the horse s ass from the co who knows what rsm 
 simpson has up his sleeve for next year battle school 82 without any questions or doubt the battle school that 
 was conducted in april 1982 had to be the highlight of the training year it was the culmination of a 
 lot of hard work and training by all concerned as well as being a workup for waincon 82 there were 
 a total of nine activities the majority of which were conducted with live ammunition beginning at the individual level and 
 workinc upto platoon size tasks nbcw training instinctive shooting grenade fire support lane forced march and shoot advance to contact 
 and a helicopter night ambush all platoons including the support weapons did each of the stands in five days needless 
 to say the battalion was quite busy throughout the period the training was probably the most realistic conducted by the 
 battalion in the last few years old uniforms blood animal guts and mannequins contributed to much of the realism with 
 the exception of the nbcw and first aid stands these were more instructional in nature live ammunition was used for 
 all the stands it became obvious that the soldiers developed a lot of confidence with all weapons and ammunitions as 
 the week progressed 0:progres 0:sed they learned to work with their buddy and to be ever conscious of personal and 
 peer safety all in all it was a most memorable training period that did much to increase professionalism morale and 
 esprit de corps the battalion as a whole is looking forward to doing it again next year 1 ppcli at 
 wainwright advance parties deployed to wainwright at the beginning 0:begin 0:ning of may for their annual extravaganza of training as 
 tentage was being erected even hardened campaigners were forced to admit that the sub zero conditions were to put it 
 mildly unusual the main body arrived on 5 may 82 in relatively fine shape apart from the usual round of 
 avgp horror stories broken down vehicles and in one case an avgp which turned on its side attempting to evade 
 a school bus as training began the weather improved the mosquitos 0:mos 0:quitos appeared in earnest and clouds of thick 
 dust were stirred up over much of the training area as avgp crews practised movement and tactics one highlight was 
 the combat team live fire exercise which proved to be most realistic the 72 hour battalion exercise was fast moving 
 and interesting exercising map reading at all levels as the battalion fought its way through the badlands the brigade exercise 
 in contrast seemed notoriously slow as 
 14 the lar team winners of the 1 cbg small arms competition is perhaps inevitable the shortage of helicopters led 
 to the cancellation of the keenly awaited air mobile exercise the brigade sports day was rained out and the heavens 
 opened for the road move back to calgary this proved to be an interesting exercise of humour and patience as 
 vehicles broke down or were separated from their parent packet all in all waincon 82 was dubbed a success as 
 many lessons were learnt and valuable training was achieved retirement parade for capt jw miles mmm cd on the 14th 
 of june 1982 a retirement parade was held for capt jw doc miles at currie barracks cfb calgary after six 
 years of service as the regimental adjutant capt miles was leaving the calgary area for a one year tour with 
 the united nations truce observer force in israel capt miles was given the honour of reviewing the first battalion 0:battal 
 0:ion prior to his departure for the middle east and subsequent 0:sub 0:sequent retirement from the forces the ceremony included 
 an inspection of the battalion complete with queen s and regimental colours by capt miles and presentations of canadian forces 
 decorations and mountbatten medallions the latter were presented to those members of the battalion who had marched as part of 
 the patricia contingent in the funeral procession for the late lord louis mountbatten father of the colonelin chief 0:colonel 0:in 
 0:chief of the regiment the countess mountbatten of burma capt miles also delivered a short speech in which he emphasized 
 the value of the regimental family and the importance of doing one s job as a professional in attendance for 
 the parade were members of capt miles family as well as major general g g brown colonel of the regiment 
 following the presentation the battalion marched past with the salute being taken by capt miles upon his return from israel 
 capt miles will have completed 32 years distinguished service to canada and the regiment he originally enrolled as a private 
 soldier in the rcic in august 1950 and proceeded to korea with 2 ppcli in november of thatyear histour included 
 action at kapyong for which the battalion received the united states presidential citation it was also during this time that 
 the nickname doc was first applied to capt miles as a result of his duties as a medical assistant and 
 stretcher bearer capt miles served two years with the rcamc returning to the regiment as a corporal in 1953 he 
 was married to leslie marjorie baker in 1955 and continued his service in various capacities until an unfortunate parachute accident 
 in 1957 despite injuries that kept him hospitalized for over three months capt miles returned to duty with ppcli and

 hark back to one of my earliest experiences as a young officer in my first battalion to aptly describe the 
 first battalion s sports program for 1981 82 cwo de bruyne who retired earlier this year was the csm and 
 i vividly remember him during one of his tirades to the company the first and foremost reason any of you 
 people are here is to prepare to fight and win in war he harangued as he did so well unfortunately 
 we don t have a war right now but we ve got sports and that s almost as good now 
 get the hell out there and destroy those 0 a better description i couldn t imagine battalion teams 1 ppcli 
 fielded a total of three teams to represent the battalion in the regular garrison leagues most of which competed in 
 exercise strong contender as well for two of these teams it was a building year but their records were impressive 
 nonetheless the battalion hockey team coached and led by wo legge had an outstanding season the team fought its way 
 to the championship in the cfb calgary inter unit league beating out 1 svc bn in the final game 7 
 5 this championship took its toll in injuries however leaving the team less the services of several key players notwithstanding 
 0:not 0:withstanding this the battalion hockey team placed second in strong contender dropping their last game of the competition to 
 the second battalion for the battalion broomball team it was an experience gaining season in inter unit play that paid 
 rich dividends later in the year getting off to a slow start the team finished fourth overall in the cfb 
 calgary league however under the coaching of sgt turner they came on like blockbusters during strong contender defeating the ldsh 
 rc team in the final game and winning overall for the battalion soccer team it was a building year also 
 coached by mcpl nabess the team placed fourth overall in the cfb calgary inter unit league inter company leagues the 
 battalion sports war literally kicked off last fall with the football campaign fortunately for a coy a single battle does 
 not a campaign make as the french grey cup winners lost their first two games by a touchdown each but 
 with superior coaching and outstanding playmakers like pte macdonald the most valuable all round player of the french grey cup 
 and pte vandenberg the most valuable defensive player the underdog a coy team capped off the extremely hard fought season 
 with a 22 6 win over b coy company hockey was almost as rough an affair as football and more 
 than once the artillery was absent and could not add any couth to the common brawls b coy finally came 
 on to prevail defeating adm coy in the final game nor was company broomball to be denied it too was 
 a hard fought campaign which contributed its fair share of bumps and bruises to the sports war in the end 
 it was combat support coy who walked away with top honours defeating c coy in the final game of the 
 season battalion sports day the sports year ended on a slightly different note in 1 ppcli this spring and the 
 companies got a rest from pounding each other for one day at least on the battalion sports day 28 jul 
 instead the officers laid life and limb on the line facing the sr ncos mcpls and cpl ptes in turn 
 at soccer water polo and softball it ended with a short it s so good hff hear your voice again

 that they would never lose to the officers again this side show was opened in the morning with the cpl 
 ptes beating the mcpls in soccer after inflicting quite humiliating defeats on the officers and sr ncos in turn that 
 was the last seen of the cpl ptes in the winners circles as the morning events brought us to tire 
 tube water polo it is rumoured that the tire tubes were inserted at the last moment when the sports officer 
 learned that rsm simpson floats like the titanic be that as it may the cpl ptes and sr ncos were 
 handily defeated by the officers and mcpls respectively leading to a wet showdown 0:show 0:down just before lunch the result 
 a 6 4 win by the officers the main campaign of the day was reserved for the afternoon when all 
 four teams were taken out to the ball field these were high scoring affairs played all afternoon 0:after 0:noon starting 
 with the officers knocking off the sr ncos 27 25 in 5 innings what defensive play i the officers team

 the officers squeaked by the cpl pte team by a score of 11 10 in five innings winning softball and 
 the day s events overall thus ended the sports war 81 82 yet even as this article is being written

 he briefly toured the unit lines looking at the company organizations and expressing great interest in the newly renovated quarters 
 in bldg b 8 and in the avgp mock up load carry the commander expressed his appreciation of the battalion 
 s hard work at the end of the day and all ranks breathed a sigh of relief until it starts 
 again next year family day once again 1 ppcli had a successful family day family day is an excellent opportunity 
 for all battalion family members to get together in a social fun environment and get to know one another this 
 year was no different as the families were blessed with a fine sunny day we ve had lots of those 
 since lcol reay left and an afternoon packed with fun games and displays it is hard to say what was 
 the most popular event for the children the death slide small arms display with blanks or the grizzly rides certainly 
 they were the most active also popular were the children s competitions baseball throw sack race long jump and the 
 50 yard dash of course all kids were winners as were the parents as there was very little baby sitting 
 required with so much activity the mothers were also involved in the competition with an egg and spoon race that 
 concluded the day s events the mothers children were more interested in throwing the eggs rather than racing but such 
 is to be expected on a fun filled day calgary stampede armed forces day 1 ppcli guard of honour billed 
 as the greatest outdoor show on earth the calgary stampede has earned a reputation as ten days of whoopin ridin 
 and all around good western fun for all traditionally the last day of the stampede is armed forces day during 
 which the canadian forces are paid a special tribute by the citizens of calgary as part of the day s 
 activities 1 ppcli was asked to provide a 100 man guard of honour tasked to perform in the grand stand 
 show prior to the rodeo championships and closing ceremonies of the stampede for 1982 the guard was comprised of members 
 of a and b coys drilled by csm brausen and commanded by major r p bragdon the troops performed their

 off to the applause of the crowd the remainder of the armed forces participation consisted 0:con 0:sisted of static displays 
 on the midway these were provided by all local units including the ppcli regimental museum the displays gave the local 
 populace a chance to see the vehicles weapons and equipment used by the armed forces and allowed them to chat 
 with soldiers from the different arms overall the day was a great success and enjoyed by all first battalion looks 
 forward to an equally good day at the next greatest outdoor show on earth nijmegen marches whoever said that an 
 army marches on its stomach has never taken part in the nijmegen marches on 10 july 1982 fifteen members of 
 1 ppcli departed for germany and ultimately nijmegen holland for the 66th annual international marches the nijmegen international 0:interna 0:tional 
 marches are a four day event the route for each day involved a tour of the city of nijmegen and 
 the surrounding 0:surround 0:ing countryside with a different route being marched every day to avoid the chance of getting into 
 a rut an average of 25 miles were covered each day and just to make things more interesting a rucksack 
 containing a ten kilogram sandbag had to be carried training started with 21 hopefuls competing for the fourteen positions on 
 the team the only shoe in was the medical assistant mcpl doc busby he was to be instrumental in the 
 treating of our aches pains and blisters during training and the actual marches while riding his bike during the march 
 he came to the painful conclusion that the feet are not the only part of the human anatomy that is 
 prone to blisters the training was to be short in duration but very intensive we managed to cram two months 
 training into four weeks this was accomplished 0:ac 0:complished with gallons of sweat and yards of moleskin at the completion 
 of training most felt that the actual march was going to be a walk over we arrived in germany on 
 14 july and commenced a four day intensive training camp to become accustomed to the european climate food beer and 
 people all of this was successfully accomplished with much individual effort and perseverance during the nijmegen marches the city assumes 
 the air of a carnival with street dances open air taverns and much comradeship the people of holland were friendly 
 to all the participants but seemed to have a special place in their hearts for canadians only a few of 
 the more hardy members of the team went into the city after the day s march to participate in the 
 festivities the rest of the team were content to soak sore and tired feet sample some dutch beer from the 
 mess and get a full night s sleep before the next day s march each day a different route through 
 the city of nijmegen and the surrounding countryside was marched we marched on everything from gravel to pavement and everything 
 in between did you know that there are four major designs of cobblestone and that each one has its own 
 peculiar way of torturing already sore feet but the friendship of the dutch people lining the route and the beautiful 
 scenery combined to ease the pain of each day s march everyone was glad but also saddened when the last 
 day of marching was completed this was an accomplishment 0:ac 0:complishment that will not be soon forgotten by those participating 
 the one thing that everyone agreed to was that they would not volunteer for any more marches until next year 
 s 67th annual nijmegen marches and so ends a very successful year for the first battalion more friends are leaving

 the annual brigade summer concentration in wainwright the battalion bivouac at border lake provided a base of operations from which 
 to conduct individual and collective training from section to battalion level the battalion battle school proved to be an ambitious 
 0:ambiti 0:ous undertaking where cbt sp coy organized ten mini exercises designed to practice the basics of soldiering in all 
 phases of war the battle school covered platoon and section live fire confidence building first aid and casualty evacuation nbcw

 may also brought a long awaited highlight for a coy when they participated in a small unit exchange with the 
 2nd battalion 16th infantry regiment of the us army the month long exercise in fort riley kansas familiarized the coy 
 with american equipment and tactics and enabled them to participate in a divisional exercise of particular interest was the use 
 of the miles laser simulation system every man and veh was equipped with laser emitting weapons and sensitive receivers hits 
 and near misses were faithfully recorded by an annoying buzzer needless to say the fieldcraft of the soldiers improved greatly 
 as the exercise progressed in turn the battalion hosted coy b 2 16 th us infantry for the duration of

 their morning runs wo two feathers and his 92 year old granny were instrumental 0:instru 0:mental in whipping the pi 
 into shape during the battalion and brigade exercises recce pi displayed its obvious flexibility talent and initiative naturally sorry there 
 were no water skis for the assault water crossing but anti tank platoon was using them recce pi also made 
 its mark during the battle school by conducting ex foggy bottom this exercise tested the rifle platoons in very challenging

 award for self defence sgt hart kept all the drivers entertained especially no maintenance mcnabb who wanted to work in 
 the kit shop anyway on a more serious note recce pi worked hard and performed well mainly due to a 
 concentrated team effort by all mortar platoon it was not until waincon after a period of inactivity that mor pi

 regiment being the only nato unit in the brigade however was to have its headaches communication drills and sops and 
 fire discipline all had to be standardized hard work and a sense of humour however soon had the obstacles out 
 of the way and 2 ppcli had the distinction of having twelve mortars smoking 0:smok 0:ing in direct support but 
 it was not all work a nato unit must also find time to relax and enjoy itself as several soldiers 
 can relate that is if they can remember as the final exercise drew to a close and everyone bid farewell 
 it was apparent many friendships had been made as everyone tightened their belts it was an exercise few would forget

 47 2nd airborne commando during the past year 2 commando has been in a perpetual state of motion after returning 
 from a month of well deserved post cyprus leave the commando jumped mind the pun into a period of intensive 
 patrol training that culminated in ex rampant runner 30 nov 4 dec 81 ex rampant runner was a patrolling exercise 
 started by a midnight drop onto dz gorvad in cfb borden the exercise stressed 0:stres 0:sed small unit special operations 
 and saw 2 commando sub units recce and destroy a number of installations in camp borden during the night of 
 03 04 dec all patrols infiltrated into the blackdown park area and attacked and destroyed a bde signal installation in 
 conjunction with cf 5 air strikes at first light the exercise ended with the commando forced marching to the airfield 
 and flying back to petawawa training for the year ended with helicopter ops being practiced during ex picquet rotor the 
 final two points worthy of noting for the year 1981 are that the men s christmas dinner was a success 
 and the officers humiliated the senior nco s 5 2 in the annual hockey grudge match the new year began 
 with winter indoctrination which was followed very quickly by ex response specialle and a first light para assault at 46 
 degrees into earlton ontario for a great number of us it was the first time ever exercising on civilian owned 
 land and the opportunity provided a number of memorable incidents wo gill became a cow doctor and delivered a baby 
 bull one morning while on sentry 7 platoon and captain mcdonough became known as in the bag seven and the 
 british exchange officer captain barry froze his hooter one of the most educational and refreshing things learned during the exercise 
 was that there are actually people out there who still think we need an army and who are outright friendly 
 to soldiers the people of earlton and elk lake went out of their way to welcome us and showed us 
 their hospitality by letting us use their houses baking food for us and bringing hot drinks to cold troopers before 
 we left earlton the commando also took the opportunity to become involved with the local recruiting program and about 70 
 all ranks put on well received static displays in area schools february was a relatively static period in which we 
 re zeroed weapons practiced battle drills and conducted a short exercise that saw 7 platoon awakened by the adjutant who 
 was also commander of the enemy force the regimental birthday was celebrated on march 17 with the usual birthday jump 
 unfortunately though the pilot corrected the wrong way for wind drift and the first stick ended up 500 metres into 
 the trees needless to say the number 1 also known as colonel cowling the regimental 0:regi 0:mental commander was less 
 than impressed at the end of march the commando squeezed onto a fleet of buses and headed once more for 
 camp borden where we conducted patrol training live fire battle drills tank hunting and personal weapons qualifications a point of 
 particular interest on this exercise was the emphasis on leadership skills at the junior nco and below level this was 
 carried out in two ways first by covert 5 man para inserted patrols using ct 2 steerable parachutes onto small 
 isolated dz s the second was a section competition held for the remainder of the battle school with points being 
 awarded for all skills being practiced the former was extremely successful especially 0:espe 0:cially with the training and practice of 
 special operations and the latter made for a keen competitive spirit throughout 0:through 0:out the commando mcpl b j mclean 
 of 2 section 5 platoon won the competition with mcpl p arnold and mcpl m g marshall and 1 and 
 2 sections of 8 platoon taking 2nd and 3rd we returned to petawawa on the easter weekend and after jumping 
 onto dz anzio marched to the regimental battle school bivouac site on easter monday this period of training concentrated once 
 again on the use of live ammunition and battlecraft all personnel took part in jungle lanes trench clearing section platoon 
 and commando 0:com 0:mando attacks intensive demolition training and patrolling 0:patrol 0:ling 2 commando distinguished itself in the latter by 
 taking first capt drew wo gill and 8 platoon and second places capt lewis wo westacott and 5 platoon in 
 the regimental patrol competition the battle school was concluded by a march and shoot competition and we didn t win 
 so we won t talk about it except to say that wo mccarthy and 6 platoon came third th regiment 
 participated in ssf directed training in may and in june we celebrated the 40th anniversary of military parachuting in canada 
 the celebration included a freedom of the city of pembroke parade the trooping of the colours static displays and an 
 all ranks trooping ball which featured the newly released airborne film also in june the regiment changed rsm s and 
 rsm bakker late of the ppcli battle school is now flexing his pacestick at the helm ex prairie feud was 
 our next trip to the field and was initiated by a para assault into camp wainwright and a live fire 
 regimental attack onto park farm the exercise was designed to test the regiment in the defence and was highlighted by 
 the usual digging wiring and patrolling on returning from wainwright the commando was once again pavement bashing in preparation for 
 the change of command parade that would see the co lcol w j g bewick replaced by maj cp dillon 
 and the csm mwo fisher e j replaced by mwo franc g p since the change of command parade 2

 56 ppcli band the band has had another interesting and very busy year performing at a myriad of functions band 
 tours and parades the season commenced with a series of visits to various hospitals and nursing homes in the calgary 
 area in september that month also heralded the start of the band s participation in school concerts the latter are 
 a regular part of the band s schedule and about six concerts are presented monthly during the fall period we 
 undertook 0:under 0:took our first tour and travelled to saskatoon saskatchewan 0:saskatche 0:wan red deer grand prairie alberta nelson and 
 trail b c the season came to an end with the annual swing of men s christmas dinner concerts held 
 in mid december this year a new twist was added when captain swaneveld the director of music organized a christmas 
 tv concert it proved to be most successful and gave the band valuable exposure to the civilian population of southern 
 alberta the new year commenced with a tour of the crowsnest pass area of southern alberta and bc which was 
 followed by tours to kamloops kelowna vernon edmonton moose jaw yellowknife nwt and to williston north dakota during the february 
 to june period interspersed with the tours were additional recording sessions school concerts and mess functions the band also participated 
 with 1 and 14 service battalions when those units were granted the freedom of the city of calgary during stampede 
 week the band was actively involved not only playing during the armed forces day activities but also provided daily band 
 concerts throughout the week all in all the ppcli band has had a very busy and interesting year and all 
 members look forward to next year s schedule with both first and third battalions trooping the colour for our colonel 
 in chief hopefully with second battalion involved in cyprus the band will be able to include that island on its 
 itinerary until next year av revoir the ppcli band editor s note the following article was submitted by p 22191 
 w ray stephens of oakville ontario thirty six years have gone by since i joined the regimental 0:regi 0:mental band 
 of princess patricia s canadian light infantry in winnipeg that was in april 1936 while some of the faces grow 
 dim and memories fade there are still a few left around and perhaps if not known might be of some 
 interest and value to those who now carry high the torch or sound their trumpets as in the case of 
 the band until about 1935 canadians were not allowed in the regimental band it was entirely british under the astute 
 and disciplined baton of captain tommy james the intrepid entrepreneur for such he was the band was supposedly formed in 
 toronto during world war i however a small historical note describes how one captain thomas james bandmaster of the royal 
 winnipeg 0:win 0:nipeg rifles took that band overseas it was there that captain james had the idea of creating the 
 band of the ppcli as the regiment at that time was using the edmonton 0:edmon 0:ton pipe band and the 
 brass band of the royal canadian regiment my era however begins in 1936 when i was perhaps about the fifth 
 canadian to join the otherwise british regiment finally the colonials were being allowed in the band up until then comprised 
 of seasoned british military musicians from the imperial army and the royal marines it is quite doubtful if ever again 
 there could be assembled such a group of superb army musicians thanks of course to the cleverness and strategy of 
 one thomas james a barnam in his own right when i first joined i was quickly made captain james batman 
 a duty evidently in keeping for colonial musicians especially 0:espe 0:cially young ones however my job lasted only one week 
 after i kept serving the captain s breakfast of bad eggs it didn t take long for an egg to 
 go bad sitting in a hot window all young canadian newcomers at that time had to take the full three 
 months trained soldier course before even blowing an instrument but the type of british musician was really proficient robertson clarinet 
 boley keeler clarinet whose daughter ran off with a new canadian clarinet player when he deserted mick toohey clarinet les 
 morrison french horn bob sumner bassoonist extraordinary who was with the first contingent overseas in 1939 and later became the 
 band director of the band in tuxedo after the war sgt harry simpson euphonium with a tongue faster than the 
 side drummer could pardiddle band sergeant butler trombone also interim bandmaster in the period between captain james and mr streeter 
 mann bass trombone and harry armstrong tuba who was also my teacher and without a doubt among the greatest tuba 
 players i have known including even my friend lan king the virtuosso of australia who was so accomplished that sir 
 gordon jacobs composed a concerto for tuba and orchestra for him armstrong later became head gardner of tuxedo barracks after 
 the war there were others but memory fades at this point so came the canadians in 1935 excellent young musicians 
 0:musi 0:cians not up to the standard of the older british ones but shortly capable of holding their own and 
 more roly hill trumpet who died of leukemia around 1943 jack bailey trombone who went to trail bc in 1937 
 when trail sent a representative to the ppcli band to scout for professional brass musicians roly hill went with him 
 ed gibney coronet who wrote the book brass playing for raphael mendes and now resides in vancouver arthur fraser a 
 dedicated musician on french horn who left before the war joined the fort garry tanks and saw action as a 
 major in europe and became director of the south carolina state university music department and founded the columbia symphony in 
 1964 he died in 1972 and the university dedicated their new concert hall fraser hall to this ex ppcli bandsman 
 i ray stevens came along about this time 1936 on tuba and after six years overseas not all with the 
 regi 
 57 ment was discharged in 1946 eventually spending thirty five years in the music publishing business and retiring in 1981 
 as president of the company publisher s association 0:associa 0:tion etc it is interesting to note that in 1938 when 
 the rcmp decided to form it s own band they approached the ppcli musicians openly and quite a number went 
 through the tests and passed to qualify however the regiment panicked and gave the musicians married rights free daily passes 
 and sergeant s mess privileges in the few years to follow before the war others came such as murray church 
 sax who served overseas and spent his service with the ppcli until retirement ernie mckeever moose trombone spent his service 
 with the rce and retired a wol frank mcdonald trombone who transferred out of the divisional band in england and 
 became a lt instructor with the officer s training school in aldershot england and is alive and well in vancouver 
 charlie crawford the first jazz trumpeter who copies his arrangements from records of that time and during the war flew 
 war planes across the atlantic for air transport command george laplante clarinet and best miler in the regiment arthur britton 
 euphonium staff shawcross trumpet and rifle shot who served as a company commander 0:com 0:mander in korea fred ligertwood tuba 
 spent his post war years in the band of the rcaf as did most of the returning ppcli bandsmen when 
 there was no ppcli band around jack jackson trumpet who finished the war as a provost in germany but went 
 into the rcaf when it was over as did crebo french horn then there was ernie topham clarinet who became 
 a noted bc lawyer and bill mercer french horn who completed his service with the rce it is interesting also 
 to note that ligertwood stephens and mercer were very active on the regimental soccer team in early 1939 wol len 
 streeter arrived with all of the diplomacy of an angry dictator complete with imperial army background and knellar hall training 
 also added about this time were others such as baldry naskar bennett hames cribb moskalyk the cossack bass and so 
 on including a veteran from the regiment larry thorsteinson who went on to fame as a canadian radio personality had 
 his own radio show broadway is my beat in new york and was seen as the colonel in the tv 
 show west point not bad for a bandsman to colonel in one step the band progressed rapidly during the short 
 few months under mr streeter they had no choice five hours daily individual practice standing up note by note with 
 bleeding lips from playing and bleeding piles from standing one grand concert in the winnipeg auditorium and it was over 
 about fifteen bandsmen signed the pink slip and went overseas with the regiment in december 1939 in the medical section 
 under doc corrigan the band of the ppcli no longer existed after several months in england trying to keep dry 
 a small regimental band sprang up among the fifteen bandsmen and with borrowed horns they performed perfunctory duties such as 
 church services marches concerts in the naffi remnants of world war i abolution rooms and the occasional burial as required 
 wo smith of battalion hq assumed musical duties mr smith was an intellectual gentleman who at one time had also 
 played french horn then the band broke up as a detachment headed to scotland in an attempt to be the 
 first canadians into action by attacking norway outfitted in ankle long sheepskin coats and wrapped with a bandolier of 303 
 bullets the remaining bandsmen faced their fate but at the last moment were replaced by the yorkshire regiment band and 
 all who went over to norway and were never seen again the regiment settled in surrey during the battle of 
 britain but there was no band efforts were made but the bandsmen by now had tasted soldiering and found it 
 a better way of life by being in london on weekends than playing at a church parade or an officers 
 mess it was 1941 or perhaps late 1940 when lt l streeter arrived in england to form the canadian army 
 band overseas first to be called back were of course the members in the regiment and they went to camp 
 witley where the first canadian divisional band was created and the first official army band of the second war it 
 was basically all ppcli but eventually all regimental insignia had to be removed for one standard divisional patch the first 
 band sergeant was bill moskalyk the cossack bass who had such a tremendous bass voice he won a scholarship to 
 the royal college of music in london and was stationed there for three years moskalyk was an accomplished youth of 
 twenty standing six foot two and also was a challenger to the regimental heavyweight championship during the early days in 
 england his opponent which nobody challenged was wo specs mack the pt instructor and although moskalyk put up a good 
 fight it was all over in thirty seconds sgt murray church came next and when he was taken ill sgt 
 stevens me became the band sergeant so here ends the history of the band up to this point ppcli regimental

 58 how do you describe 1982 at the canadian airborne centre stupendous exciting demanding interesting painful it s been all 
 those and more if nothing else it s certainly been eventful to date there have been 14 basic para three 
 jumpmaster one para instructor three mfp three ueo three dz lz ez controller and four packer rigger courses totalling more 
 than one thousand students 0:stu 0:dents the year started well with lcol d d don dalziel our commanding officer joining 
 the century club by making 0:mak 0:ing his 100 th para descent about this time we also had some visitors 
 from the arab state of abu dhabi needless to say they found our edmonton winter somewhat cooler than they were 
 used to experiencing as a result of this visit mwo collier and mwo clavette were able to return to the 
 arab state in may to give some much needed para instructor assistance we also ran the annual geritol and army 
 cadet serials these two courses are the most interesting to come through the centre each year the over forty and 
 undereighteen 0:under 0:eighteen crowd are subjected to the same demanding standards expected of all regular basic para serials however the 
 esprit de corp and motivation shown during these serials is second to none one notable addition to the geritol course 
 this year was mr nick lees better known as major danger columnist for the edmonton journal major danger enjoys abusing 
 his body in the best airborne tradition the sky hawks have now completed their 12th year and the 889 th 
 live demonstration of aerial aerobatics and precision freefall parachuting between the end of april to the beginning of october the 
 sky hawks have performed 50 shows in front of more than two million spectators this year s schedule took the 
 sky hawks from whitehorse in the yukon to gander newfoundland and from dominion day celebrations in ottawa july ist to 
 the b c summer games in vernon 8 c august 26th on the 19th of september the team set a 
 record by being the first demonstration team to jump over cfs alert this year s officer in charge is capt 
 gerry vida who has 2 700 jumps 23 years service and has served with all three battalions of the ppcli 
 other serving patricias are capt romas blekaitis team administrative officer wo billy bolen who has just retired for a second 
 time with over 33 years service sgt roy comeau mcpl geof crossman and cpl tim ryan the remaining members of 
 the team come from a variety of regular and reserve units remember i mentioned painful well for those of us 
 who thought we could remain physically idle while here at the centre soon had our hopes destroyed as rsm witt 
 introduced the infamous pegasus days they usually consist of a combination of fighting order running climbing shooting rucksacks and jumping 
 needless to say the centre has experienced the odd blister and sweat soaked shirt all good airborne fun it s 
 been an excellent year here at the airborne centre and we look forward to an even better one next year

 62 1 royal green jackets commanding officer lt col cclo owon mvo mbe in the middle of july 1981 the 
 battalion completed a four month tour on the border between northern ireland and eire due to the increased terrorist activity 
 surrounding the deaths of various ira hunger strikers our tour had been very active there were a number of contacts 
 including cross border sniping the mortaring of one of our platoon bases and the mining of a saracen apc all 
 the crew were killed in this incident the battalion returned to its main base at hounslow near london for four 
 months before moving out to northern ireland again however this time the battalion moved with all its families and became 
 one of the resident battalions the battalion is stationed beside the main airfield at aldergrove this lies about ten miles 
 inland from belfast aldergrove offers a modern airy barracks and good married quarters in the town of antrim some seven 
 miles away the battalion is responsible for the security of north belfast one rifle company with a small battalion tactical 
 headquarters is sited in the middle of the catholic area from where the greatest trouble can be anticipated though all 
 the battalion is involved during periods of tension the level of terrorist activity has not been high this year and 
 this has allowed us to get on with other things some training in england has been possible and a number 
 of skiing mountaineering and diving parties have visited scotland each of the twelve rifle platoons takes part in a two 
 day inter platoon military skills competition which partly takes place in the bleak hills along the north east coast so 
 far five platoons have taken part and the inter platoon competitive spirit is not unapparent many activities 0:ac 0:tivities are 
 flourishing in the comparative stability of northern ireland and the sailing and fishing clubs both hope to get all the 
 benefit that they can from the situation at the moment of writing we have just heard that our battalion band 
 has been the target of an ira bomb attack while playing in the bandstand in regents park london six bandsmen 
 have been killed and twelve more are in hospital this is a shattering blow and is a sad note on 
 which to end our news 2 royal green jackets commanding officer lt col mjc robertson mc every year one starts 
 off by saying how busy a time one has had this year we really mean it our initial introduction 0:introduc 
 0:tion into our mechanized role in baor came to a close on 21 august with the majority of the battalion 
 departing on pre northern ireland block leave after two months intensive training the battalion was fully prepared for a four 
 month tour of duty in the republican area of west belfast on our return to germany in late march 82 
 preparations for the pre batus british army training unit suffield training began in earnest now the highlights the battle group 
 open day was held in early july 81 and was aimed at showing our families and the local minden civilians 
 the equipment we use and the roles we in the battle group play a platoon attack demonstration a free fall 
 display royal green jacket drill and finally an extremely good sounding of retreat were among the features of the programme 
 this was one of the few occasions that we have managed to listen to the band this year for in 
 baor all bands come under the control of hq baor we fired our annual personal weapon test and the tickle 
 competition during the sennelager field firing period in august 81 this was followed by a further fortnight of team battle 
 shooting we also managed to run the annual bramall trophy which consisted of a variety of tests for platoons 7 
 platoon commanded by lt robin berrill excelled at the eight mile cross country march and falling plates shoot and emerged 
 as the winners following our august block leave all our attention and efforts were directed towards northern ireland a thoroughly 
 professional nitat team advised us throughout our training and we were exceedingly grateful for their constructive criticisms and useful tips 
 the three week package of concentrated shooting and training in a simulated urban environment were to pay substantial dividends in 
 belfast on 15 november we took over command of the west belfast patch from 45 royal marine commando west belfast 
 was still simmering from a summer of violence after the collapse of the hunger strike the royal ulster constabulary ruc 
 were very much asserting themselves 0:them 0:selves with the military increasingly taking on a supporting 0:support 0:ing role the four 
 month tour was in almost every way an outstandingly successful one it would be wrong however 0:how 0:ever to lay 
 stress on the many successes arrests and finds we had when the tragic deaths of riflemen holland malakos and rapley 
 are so fresh in our minds with less than three days to go in belfast their mobile landrover patrol was 
 caught in heavy gunfire directed at them from a well planned and executed pir a ambush despite this one frustratingly 
 sad incident on balance we were blessed with good fortune patience restraint and professionalism 0:profes 0:sionalism were exhibited daily by 
 our riflemen as they went about their thankless and often tedious tasks following our post northern ireland block leave we 
 began mechanized soldiering again on 3 may 82 and found the pace of life no less hectic than where we 
 left off last year field firing in sennelager cpxs and mechanized training for our batus battle group in soltau have 
 kept all of us occupied up until the time of writing superimposed on the already ambitious programme has been the 
 armoured infantry trial which has lead to the battalion reorganizing into four rifle companies each of two platoons plus a 
 support platoon one of assault pioneers recce mortars and anti tanks this has called for a considerable degree of flexibility 
 the months ahead of us are fully booked two companies 0:com 0:panies plus battalion hq will go to canada to 
 carry out live firing on ex medicine man 5 with all our battle group affiliations a total of over one 
 thousand men meanwhile our other companies are preparing for minden week in september conducting live firing and getting ready for 
 the autumn ftx it will undoubtedly be a worthwhile and rewarding period we welcome capt jim morgan ppcli who is 
 on attachment 0:attach 0:ment to us for two years and who is now firmly in the chair 
 63 as 2ic d coy from the officers ncos and riflemen of the 2nd battalion we extend our best wishes 
 to brother riflemen wherever they may be for the year ahead 3 royal green jackets commanding officer lt col rh 
 ker mc july found the bn ready to take over as the spearhead mobile reserve deployable worldwide within 72 hours 
 as spearhead approached the increasingly violent disturbances 0:distur 0:bances of the hunger strike in n ireland made an emergency tour 
 appear very likely but after a recce over the water and an intensive 10 days n ireland training package in 
 lydd for the entire battalion the situation quietened down and we ended up with an uneventful six weeks in cambridge 
 with spearhead behind us we took three weeks summer 0:sum 0:mer leave and then started training for the tarleton trophy 
 inter platoon competition this took place at the end of september and consisted of a very intensive 30 hour exercise 
 the testing of every member of the platoon in a number of skills in camp and finished off with an 
 inter platoon shooting competition three weeks later the battalion moved to cyprus for ex moon base a five week bn 
 training period although we had only completed a six month un tour of cyprus the previous year it was very 
 pleasant to come back and get another five weeks of summer just as the english winter was starting the first 
 three weeks were spent with the companies moving between four separate bases spread all over the island in the far 
 northwest each company was able to enjoy excellent field firing conditions in the deserted akamas peninsula and superb snorkelling and 
 swimming in the rocky coves of its coast in akrotiri the empahsis was again on shooting but with water sports 
 coming a very close second while one platoon practised for the bn shooting competition or shot its apwt another platoon 
 would be enjoying the facilities of the bn watermanship centre water skiing sailing canoeing and windsurfing with expert tuition were 
 available to everybody a third company base was the troodos leave centre in the heart of the mountains as military 
 uniforms and equipment were forbidden here in the republic of cyprus adventure training took priority and the company spent its 
 time climbing abseiling and trekking through the mountains to explore the farther villages and the remoter corners of the mountain 
 range the final company was based with bn hq in bloodhound camp near episkopi and was more straight forwardly military 
 concentrating on field training over the rocky and almost moon like landscape of the evdhimou training area by the end 
 of this period as many riflemen as possible had shot trekked waterskied swum and sailed and become extremely fit in 
 the process we then moved to dhekelia for the bn rifle meeting and finished off with a three day bn 
 counter insurgency exercise back in the very barren hilly and almost waterless 0:water 0:less akamas peninsula the exercise almost entirely 
 on foot had two features of special interest the first was the provision of two donkeys and a usually inebriated 
 cypriot donkey handler for each company as first line transport the second was the arrival of the final day s 
 rations on their own feet at the rate of one locally purchased cypriot chicken per half section which led to 
 some interesting demonstrations of field cooking throughout the winter courses were run for signallers mortarmen jncos and section commanders with 
 study days and as much apc familiarization training as possible all this individual training then culminated in exercise phantom bugle 
 when we took part in the largest mechanized exercise held in uk for the school of infantry combat team commanders 
 course we held a two week skill at arms meeting at hythe and lydd in march and then finished packing 
 up in oakington before moving to celle in early may since our arrival here we have become a mechanized battle 
 group as part of 22 armoured brigade with almost a hundred armoured vehicles of our own in contrast to our 
 handful of landrovers in oakington the town is superb the most beautiful in northern germany and the local people are 
 very friendly we are looking forward to a very enjoyable five year tour in our new role 4 royal green 
 jackets commanding officer lt col cjp miers 4rgj has had a busy and enjoyable year since july 1981 there has 
 been a steady influx of potential recruits keeping the battalion well up to strength the one advantage 0:advan 0:tage of 
 the employment situation in this country has been that a number of volunteer riflemen and officers have been available for 
 additional training and for extrabattalion 0:extra 0:battalion duties doing valuable pr for the regiment assisting other units such as eton

 69 3rd battalion during the period july 1981 june 1982 old faithful had two major concerns these were firstly the 
 gearing of the battalion towards an airmobile role and secondly the move from woodside south australia to its new home 
 with the rest of 1 brigade in holsworthy barracks sydney the period also saw the departure of ltcol s krasnoff 
 as commanding officer in january 1982 and the reins taken over by ltcol j connolly from 15 june 1981 to 
 30 june 1981 the co and many senior officers from the battalion participated in exercise tropic lightning the cpx in 
 hawaii they certainly appreciated the opportunity to work with the us army not to mention the sights afforded by the 
 islands from september 1981 the unit began to move married personnel across to holsworthy to form the holsworthy detachment of 
 3 rar a move of 1 100 km as the galah an australian parrot flies this body prepared the way 
 for the move across of the unit s stores and personnel most of the unit s married members were across 
 by december 1981 and the single members returned from leave to holsworthy by february 1982 the battalion was on the 
 ground in holsworthy co located with 8 12 medium regiment royal australian artillery we were co located in the lines 
 until may which created something of a squeeze despite the fact that everybody to some extent missesthe quiet rural atmosphere 
 of woodside the unit has now settled comfortably in the big smoke of sydney the unit maintained a heavy commitment 
 to support other units and activities particularly exercise kangaroo 81 where we supplied a headquarters defence company general duties and 
 most of our officers and senior ncos as umpires for the period 12 octoberto 5 november this coupled with support 
 to various army reserve courses meantthatfora large part of the latter half of 1981 the unit was light on the 
 ground on 2 december 1981 3 rar held a final parade at woodside the unit flag was lowered for the 
 last time as the unit bid a formal farewell to woodside the move to sydney saw the end of a 
 16 year association with south australia ltcol krasnoff commanded the parade which also saw the unveiling of a plaque commemorating 
 the time spent in south australia the importance of live firing was emphasized in 1982 by exercise shut out held
