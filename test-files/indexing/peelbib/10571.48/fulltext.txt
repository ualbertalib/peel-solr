 iii colonel in chief princess patricia s canadian light infantry the countess mountbatten of burma cd jp dl in may 
 of this year i was able for the first time since being appointed colonel in chief in 1974 to visit 
 my patricias stationed on my side of the atlantic after many years absence my husband was able to accompany me 
 on this visit to my second battalion who we found in very good heart and shape and enjoying the challenges 
 and experience after our visit to them in baden soellingen we were privileged to be part of the contingent which 
 travelled up to ypres in belgium to take part in the 75th anniversary of the battle of frezenburg i think 
 we will always remember this occasion as one of the most moving of our lives to see for ourselves the 
 evidence of that terrible campaign in the great war which cost hundreds of thousands of lives over the years and 
 nearly wiped out our own originals it was an extraordinary experience to have a veteran of that battle with us 
 in the presence of jimmy vaughan who celebrated his 90th birthday during the visit what supermen those soldiers were merely 
 to survive those horrific conditions of living let alone fighting however i do know that the modern soldier has the 
 same spirit and pride in our regiment as did the much admired originals and would acquit himself as bravely if 
 the need ever arose i feel very proud to be part of such a splendid regiment and send my warmest 
 wishes to you all and your families 
 colonel of the regiment princess patricia s canadian light infantry seen from my own viewpoint 0:view 0:point 1985 was yet 
 another good year for our regiment each battalion and 2 ab cdo has in turn distinguished itself 0:it 0:self in 
 one way or another the battle school maintained the high standard all have come to expect of it regimental 0:regi

 patricias whether they be with the french grey battalion in gagetown or elsewhere 0:else 0:where have made valuable contributions to 
 the operational 0:oper 0:ational and administrative effectiveness of the canadian forces the regiment s own extended family and in particular 
 the ppcli association has dramatically increased its membership and expanded the scope of its activities but for the high standard 
 of professionalism 0:pro 0:fessionalism and personal dedication of all ranks and for the hard work and initiative of the officers 
 and members of the association none of this could have happened each one of us every patricia is in one 
 way or another responsible for the success of the regiment and hasacontinuing responsibility to see that success is maintained making 
 plain what our obligations 0:obliga 0:tions and opportunities are in this regard and what goals are to be pursued collectively 
 and consistently over time must continue to be a central function and major challenge of regimental government an important element 
 of our success this past year has been that we have for some time past been operating 0:oper 0:ating within 
 a planning framework this framework sets out the longer term objectives which should inform 0:in 0:form all of our planning 
 and in consonance with which shorter term goals can be set plans can be made and the results of regimental 
 activities can be carefully and consistently evaluated we must all be aware of the regiment s objectives and to the 
 extent that opportunity permits conscientiously 0:con 0:scientiously seek to advance them it may be that not colonel w b s

 t3e itb telephone 403 240 7525 message from the national president ppcli association as we enter into the 38th year 
 of our founding as a regimental association i can t help but wonder where we are headed in the years 
 to come you might well ask yourselves that if i don t know then just who does as an association 
 we continue to grow as evidenced by the formation of two new branches in the past two years and also 
 by the revitalizing of another branch and the continued growth of existing branch strengths but that is not what concerns 
 me what does concern me and i know is of concern to others as well is just what are our 
 long term goals and objectives one can argue that our constitution sets out the aims of our association and indeed 
 it does to refresh your memory our aims briefly are to 1 perpetuate comradeship and esprit de corps 2 maintain 
 and promote regimental tradition 3 establish and maintain a regimental museum 4 assist members and widows and children of deceased 
 members when other social agencies are unable to do so and 5 undertake educational programmes through the hamilton gault memorial 
 fund in my opinion we meet the challenges of the first two aims with no difficulty whatsoever it is the 
 last three items that concern me are you aware that the association is the owner of all that rests in 
 the regimental museum the museum is in desperate need of new facilities in the very near future if we are 
 to ensure the safe and proper storage of our priceless regimental artifacts i have recently been in touch by letter 
 with all branch presidents to outline to them one of the ways that we as an association might be able 
 to help i look forward to receiving their suggestions and to further discussion at our next annual general meeting in 
 edmonton in may i am also concerned about the degree and the amount of financial support that we can provide 
 to our members when it is clearly evident that we are the last resort for help i solicit your thoughts 
 and ideas that you may have either directly or through your branches the last item that of educational programmes is 
 not so pressing but one that we should be thinking about nevertheless give these items some thought i would like 
 to hear from you r m middleton president ppcli association

 8 the patricia s treasure cart jeffery williams in the regimental museum is an exquisitely executed model of a golden 
 treasure cart straight out of oriental mythology it is a souvenir of service in the korean war yet forty four 
 years ago it had been designed to smooth the path of japanese expansion in south east asia in 1952 the 
 officers of the first battalion decided that they should have a souvenir of their service in the far east to 
 display in the mess ideally it should be of korean origin but investigation turned up nothing which originated in that 
 sad country which held any appeal the only oriental items of military historical interest which were attractive in a decorative 
 sense were japanese samurai helmets and swords while all members of the regiment serving in korea had been to japan 
 these items were ruled out because their presence there had only been incidental to the task of fighting the war 
 the officers felt that if they could not obtain a fitting korean souvenir they should obtain something typical of the 
 orient as a whole further it was far more important that the item be an acceptable work of art than 
 that it have any military significance the place for trophies of war is the regimental museum not the officers mess 
 since i was going to japan i was instructed to look for something suitable in tokyo i discussed the problem 
 with the canadian ambassador and with friends who had lived in the far east for many years they suggested various 
 art galleries and an old firm of gold and silversmiths miyamoto shoko there i found the treasure cart mr uchida 
 one of the directors told me its story in 1941 planning had begun for a state visit to japan by 
 the king of siam the two countries already enjoyed friendly relations which the foreign office in tokyo hoped might be 
 developed into a full alliance in march of that year the japanese had supported the siamese against the vichy french 
 at the conference table and had won for them considerable territories in laos and cambodia if the siamese would side 
 with them the road to burma and malaya would lie open during his visit they would seek to impress the 
 young king both with the sincerity of their friendship and with their power every detail must contribute to that end 
 even the gift with which by custom the emperor would greet his brother from bangkok throughout the orient it was 
 the custom of centuries that when an overlord visited one of his territories the local ruler would present him with 
 tribute in china and in countries like japan and korea which share her traditions this usually took the form of 
 a cart form of a cart loaded with treasure silks gold silver spices and precious stones references to such incidents 
 abound in the history of the east and in its fairy tales at one time the kings of siam had 
 been the most powerful rulers in asia and they were quite accustomed to receiving tribute from their vassals while gold 
 and precious stones in themselves were entirely acceptable as tribute to most oriental rulers it was considered indelicate to offer 
 these to one so powerful as the sovereign in bangkok annually the kings of the other countries of south east 
 asia would each present him with a tree of solid gold every leaf and twig being as finely made as 
 a delicate piece of jewellery what more suitable present then could be designed for the emperor of japan to give 
 the king than a symbol of the traditional tribute of the orient modelled in gold it was in these circumstances 
 that an official of the imperial household called upon miyamoto shoko to produce a miniature treasure cart loaded with bales 
 of silk jars of spices jewels and bullion all delicately made in gold the cart itself was to be in 
 gold and silver with silken drag ropes seeking credit for the first time or just need credit for a new

 sales ltd 9th ave 11th st s w calgary ab by appointment only 
 9 the cart was completed in good time but the exigencies of war interfered with the visit it was postponed 
 then later cancelled miyamoto shoko were informed that the model would not be needed ruefully they placed it on an 
 upper shelf of their display room in tokyo more to impress customers with the quality of their workmanship than in 
 the hope that it might attract the eye of a purchaser it was plain to me that the goldsmiths regarded 
 it as something of a white elephant and were glad to sell after having it inspected by experts who pronounced 
 it a work of excellent quality i agreed to buy it for the equivalent of six hundred dollars the cart 
 was first displayed in the officers mess in calgary then in other stations in canada and germany it was an 
 interesting talking piece and guests in the mess often speculated on the motives of the japanese in designing such a 
 gift for the young king of siam was the treasure cart intended as a graceful gesture of respect or was 
 there the suggestion of mockery even of a veiled threat in the payment of tribute by the mighty emperor of 
 japan to little siam so widespread was the interest in the treasure cart that it has been moved to the 
 regimental museum where its beauty and workmanship may be appreciated by all members of the regiment and by the general 
 public regimental donations 1985 the regiment wishes to acknowledge and sincerely thank the following organizations for their generous financial donations

 15 1985 was a time of big changes for the first battalion football fans would call it a rebuilding year 
 a year where we put the memories of cyprus behind us and got down to the business of infantry training 
 again the 85 season brought with it a wave of new faces as trades and retirements took their toll of 
 the wellknown 0:well 0:known players and of course it was the year of the big game ry 85 with all 
 the other clubs in the cf coming to play on our home turf but to no one s surprise the 
 home team dug deep and came up with a winning year from waxing the competition at strong contender to chasing 
 the americans around their own training area to showing everyone at ry how things are done the first battalion again 
 demonstrated the style that makes us in our humble opinion the best battalion in nato here s how it went 
 mcplmoriey recce pi rv 85 brim frost the first big event of the year was ex brim frost at fort 
 wainwright alaska it seems the dreaded fantasians had gained a toehold in the trackless wastes south of fairbanks and were 
 resisting all attempts at throwing them out fortunately our american cousins in 172 bde had the sense to call for 
 help and within hours that big white 707 was winging its way north with a hardy band of first battalion 
 warriors on board or at least that was the plan in actual fact our heroes were treated to the shortest 
 service flight on record as the cockpit filled with smoke the pilot announced that we were turning back due to 
 a minor electrical problem and sure enough all the minor fire trucks were lining the minor runway with their minor 
 lights flashing as we came in sadly the mysterious malfunction couldn t be fixed on the weekend and with tears 
 in our eyes we returned home to watch the super bowl and dream about the land of ice snow and 
 three dollar beer brim frost princess patricia s panzer grenadiers ambush tel 403 246 9464 hermann krehmer y mountain view

 16 when we finally did arrive in alaska it was to face a slightly different challenge than the usual wainwright 
 winter ex four feet of powder snow on the ground turned 1 km moves into death marches and left even 
 the most graceful snowshoers stumbling around like drunken elephants and then there was the featureless terrain we quickly learned about 
 ballpark grid references or as one sgt put it if you can t see the road you re lost anyway 
 so make up something that sounds close faced with such obstacles plus the fact that the entire enemy force ended 
 up on our battalion s route progress was understandably 0:under 0:standably slow and we were a mere 24 hours ahead 
 of schedule at endex the yanks were extremely grateful for this small mercy and said they might even invite us 
 back if we promised not to laugh at their inflatable boots anymore of course once the ex was over the 
 really serious work began telling war stories and trading for american kit it was a rough two days but we 
 finally boarded the airplane for home secure in the knowledge that we d snapped up every last poncho liner in 
 a 50 mile radius wo white in sunny alaska fire mission division strong contender after brim frost the usual annual 
 routine took over pcf courses were run equipment was repaired and the officers swarmed off to shilo for a study 
 week the big news though was ex strong contender as the stalwart lads of the broomball volleyball and hockey teams 
 went off to do battle for the glory of the battalion while unforeseen technical difficulties choke choke kept us from 
 winning all three trophies the hockey team did us proud as they skated past the strathconas into a final against 
 the highly rated at least in their own minds 1 svc bn team it was a hard fought contest but 
 eventually superior skill and size triumphed and the first battalion took home the silverware then to prove it was not 
 a fluke the same team won the base league final and went on to place third in the fmc nationals

 year s guest of honour was mgen g g brown past colonel of the regiment who reviewed the parade and 
 stayed on to watch the sports day that followed what he saw was almost a clean sweep as combat support 
 coy took the tug of war broom i loo and floor hockey titles only a b coy victory in european 
 handball broke the monotony as the men from combat support easily won the overall prize the day was capped off 
 with the organized mayhem known as the officer sr nco broom i loo game although new records were set for 
 mir customers the officers once again took home the coveted horse s ass leaving the sr nco s to settle 
 for the other parts mgen brown also took the opportunity to present the bn with the hamilton gault trophy all 
 of the infantry battalions in the cf including the airborne commandos compete every year for this award with justified pride 
 we can boast that 1985 was the fourth victory in a row for 1 ppcli four years of being the 
 best marksmen inthecf if the founder were still alive today he would be happy to see that the patricia tradition 
 of excellence in shooting is being carried on by the first battalion first battalion once again the top shots of

 18 unbeknownst to the peace loving patricias though trouble was brewing the godless forces of orangeland plotted to paralyze canada 
 by seizing the industrial heartland around wainwright godless yes bright no by mid april diplomatic solutions had failed and the 
 first battalion along with a few assorted guys from those other units deployed to form the first canadian division and 
 next time i catch you boys playing with my radar set you ll all be grounded cpl hargrave takes a 
 bearing on home westgate hotel 300 km ry 85 the main event ry 85 proved to be a resounding success 
 with the battalion able to exercise as a complete unit for the first time since we left for cyprus the 
 emphasis was on small unit training at first and many hours were spent perfecting skills on the grenade assault range 
 and section live fire range each platoon also rotated through first aid and chemical warfare stands as well as a 
 live fire night ambush patrol pioneer platoon was busy supervising the digging of an authentic warsaw pact defensive position on 
 badger hill much sweat was expended on this project but the end result was an excellent training aid for the 
 rifle companies with extra realism provided by live explosive charges taped battle noises and uniformed enemy soldiers this exercise in 
 trench clearing was one of the high points of the training year and a good lesson for all another bonus 
 that helped make the training realistic was the latest in technological toys the sawes small arms weapons effects simulator by 
 adding a low powered laser to each rifle sawes forces soldiers to take field craft seriously each man wears a 
 sensor harness which makes a very embarrassing beeping noise when hit by the laser and the only way to stop 
 the beeping is to roll over and stop moving it looks like the days of bang bang i got you 
 are gone forever rv 85 field testing the new combat long johns rv 85 sgt anderson in the warsaw pact

 19 as the small unit training drew to a close each man could look around and see the vast improvement 
 in individual skills section battle drills and platoon and company tactics sure there were scary moments such as a certain 
 young subaltern let loose with his first grenade and annoying moments fighting in an nbcw suit on a scorching day 
 comes to mind above all there was a lot of plain hard work but the results were worth the trouble 
 by the time of the final div exercise first battalion was a tightly knit team equal to any and second 
 to none as we drove across the ribstone on the final attack sending the orange hordes fleeing before us few 
 would doubt that we had the spirit and skill to do any job our country might give us capping off 
 the two months of ry was ex antelope in suffield leaving wainwright and its sea of caterpillars behind we joined

 thought they had the answer a threeroom 0:three 0:room bungalow underground unfortunately the laws of physics intervened but the bearded 
 wonders are undaunted apparently they re working on a new model with a two car garage meanwhile the rifle companies 
 made a few holes of their own including some rather large ones 84mm in the targets at the live fire 
 ranges few things in life are as miserable as lying motionless at an ambush site for half of a wainwright 
 night but somehow cutting loose with gpmg tracer and 84mm heat rounds makes up for the waiting lobo gunner gave 
 us a chance to work out the bugs at platoon and company level i e to train the new ocs

 22 ripley s believe it or not an interesting story surfaced recently which is beyond belief considering the time of 
 the incident our regimental history volume 11 shows the regiment winning a total number of 369 decorations distinctions and awards 
 while the accuracy of this number has been under suspicion for years it certainly does not contain the award given 
 to a patricia by the german empire bavarian minister of war in 1918 the story which follows was related to 
 the regiment by a recent visitor to the museum and archives no less than the grand nephew garth cochran mr 
 cochran donated several artifacts and supporting documents to this story 475801 private h a cochran a member of the 3rd 
 mcgill company joined the regiment on january 21 1916 at the battle of sanctuary wood june 2nd 1916 he was 
 critically wounded and eventually taken prisoner and found himself in a military hospital just outside munich during his convalescence period 
 he was permitted to work for a german business as a free man it was during this period that private 
 cochran was to be decorated for bravery with the bavarian cross of military merit 3rd class the citation reads war

 25 patricias return to frezenberg by lieutenant m j parker in regimental history the battle of frezenberg is remembered as 
 a fight which left the originals of the ppcli dead and the patricia s truly bloodied as a regiment may 
 8 1985 marked the seventieth anniversary of this very significant battle and the second battalion spent this on and around 
 the ground on which the battle was fought the battalion s commemorations of the battle of frezenberg took place over 
 the period of a week beginning at its home at cfb baden soellingen highlights of the baden based activities were 
 a briefing on the battle to yips battalion members and their families a keenly contested drill competition won by a 
 company and mess dinners the battalion was very fortunate to have our colonel in chief in attendance for these activities 
 lady patricia also undertook her first tour of the battalion lines in its new home since 2 ppcli rotated to 
 west germany in 1984 the battalion has also been honoured with the presence of the colonel of the regiment colonel 
 wbs sutherland brigadier jimmy de lalanne mr jimmy vaughan a surviving veteran of the battle and major rod middleton national 
 president of the ppcli association the highlight of the week was travelling to the actual battlefield at bellewaerde ridge and 
 the frezenberg memorial on bellewaerde ridge for a service of remembrance following this the battalion marched the five kilometres into 
 ypres retracing the route taken by patricia s seventy years before after they had been relieved from the line following 
 the battle of frezenberg once in ypres the battalion halted at the famous cloth hall to ask to exercise the 
 regiment s right to the freedom of the city from the mayor ceremonies in ypres concluded with an evening drumhead 
 service at the menin gate during which the regimental colours were re dedicated the massive arch of menin gate was 
 a most suitable setting for this ceremony on its walls are recorded the names of thousands of allied soldiers who 
 died around ypres during the great war including the many patricia s who fell at frezenberg in the end the 
 week presented a unique opportunity for the battalion to represent the regiment at a site on which the early foundation 
 of our regimental espirit found its base it was also a fitting time to re affirm the battalion s present 
 commitment to peace in europe lest we forget mr and mrs j w vaughan and brig ret d j a

 era of trench warfare to ptes robinson and duncan much of the countryside the battalion could devastate for many the 
 sight of burning vehicle hulls the smell of cordite and the familiar heave of a crew served weapon provided a 
 welcome respite to the doldrums of garrison life if there is one word that would be used to describe the 
 battle school it would have to be intense during the first week the training focused primarily on honing the skills 
 of the individual soldier at the fire group and the rifle section level close quarter battle lanes machine gun and 
 pairs fire and movement ranges provided unit members with valuable experience in manoeuvering with the complete inventory of platoon weapons 
 in particular a highlight of this year s battle school was the opportunity to fire the new 84mm rocket assisted 
 projectile rap round experience was also gained in employing the m 67 hand grenade on the grenade golf course and 
 in firing the 60mm mortar during the numerous twilight shoots by the completion of the first week the average battalion 
 soldier had employed more weapons and fired more ammunition than rambo could have possibly imagined remember throw the grenade not 
 the pin sennelager battle school by lieutenant c r king on 19 may 1985 the second battalion left behind the 
 boot polish and pace sticks of the frezenberg celebrations and took to the ranges of camp sennelager to conduct the 
 first battle school of the year originally designed as a training refresher in weapons handling fieldcraft patrolling chemical defense drills 
 and battle tactics the sennelager battle school turned into an exercise of seeing how many of the british army s 
 figure 11 targets and how laden oh you mean load i normally weekends are pretty quiet affairs in the camp 
 sennelager 0:senne 0:lager community not so while the canadians were there as the second battalion selected the weekend period between 
 the first and second week of the school to conduct its annual march and shoot competition conducted on perhaps the 
 hottest day of 1985 this gruelling event had the various platoons of the battalion complete a 23 kilometre march and 
 compete in a variety of military skills stands the competition had a number of surprises as maintenance platoon under the 
 command of captain lan poulter captured first place in the afv recognition first aid and grenade assault stands alpha company 
 made a strong showing as 1 platoon had the best time for the ten kilometre forced march while 2 and 
 3 platoons obtained the best scores on the range practise and obstacle course respectively once the scores were tabulated however 
 9 platoon under the command of warrant officer g m smith achieved its second consecutive victory in this annual event 
 after an evening of soaking blisters and satisfying burning thirsts the battalion commenced the second week of the school by 
 conducting section and platoon sized field firing ranges these ranges were constructed to exercise commanders and soldiers in gasthaus engel 
 food rooms parties schwarzach 07227 2419 
 28 their battle skills under conditions that simulated those of actual combat the platoon attack range was particularly impressive as 
 platoons attacked through buildings and woods and were constantly subjected to accurate enemy artillery fire at the conclusion of this 
 part of the battle school sections and platoons had gained considerable experience and had learned many valuable lessons in tactics 
 and the application of firepower the sennelager battle school was an immense success for the battalion as it provided not 
 only an opportunity for everyone to practice individual skills but also to apply new techniques and ideas there can be 
 no doubt that this training period has made a great contribution to the battalion s ability to fulfill its operational 
 role in europe to those old enough to remember sennelager remains a first class training facility thanks i needed thatl

 hammelberg by captain j ft byatt on 26 june 1985 the battalion rolled into kampftruppeschule ems in hammelberg for its 
 first ever period of detailed dismounted fibua training the bundeswehr maintain an entire village bonnland for the purpose of allowing 
 nato infantry battalions the opportunity of practicing street fighting where it should be done on the streets for most participants 
 the exercise was one of the best that they had ever attended enthusiasm could be measured by the 50 plus 
 visits to the mir during the first two days of training due to overexuberance in this realistic and demanding environment 
 the emphasis was on individual section and platoon level training for this exercise the support platoons re organized themselves into 
 rifle platoons even the bhq signallers under the command of the new signals officer capt larry conan aitken were seen 
 dashing from building to building the first stage consisted of individual skills training which was conducted for the battalion by 
 a cadre from a coy 3 rgj who were experienced in fibua techniques some of the details of room clearing 
 booby trapping and just being able to move in and around buildings were passed on by the 3 rgj soon 
 imaginations caught fire and some truly sadistic solutions to both attacking and defending a house were tried after two days 
 of individual stands the fighting started in earnest platoons having had an opportunity to shake themselves out conducted operations against 
 each other platoon on platoon skirmishing progressed to company on platoon and the exercise culminated in a battalion attack on 
 bonnland which was vigorously defended by a coy 3 rgj special mention goes to 13 platoon which was composed of 
 our vehicle and weapons techs who downed tools picked up their rifles and gained a lodgement on one side of 
 the village at the beginning of the attack well done maintainers overall it was an excellent training period it was 
 a tiring but exhilarating week and most young soldiers agreed that they had learned more about their profession in this 
 short period than at any other time in their service come out come out or 111 blow your house down

 we came we saw we conquered those were the first words spoken by the new arrivals to the second battalion 
 to form the new and exciting delta company actually the words were more like look out germany the champagne company 
 is here hailing from the third battalion victoria british california lotusland an entire company of young fresh blood was added 
 to the duty roster of 2 ppcli not since 1973 has the second battalion been graced with the presence of 
 a fourth rifle company under the leadership of major wylie kemp they crossed canada and the briny sea and plunged 
 headlong into the untamed world known as cfb baden bringing along a bit of west coast refinement and plunge they 
 did right out of two months of ry 85 in wainwright alberta the boys of delta company after a week

 and olesluk enjoy a sunny day in the hohenfels training area fallex 85 by lieutenant j hammond the battalion participated 
 in fallex 85 from 20 august to 20 september 1985 the exercise was actually a series of shorter training exercises 
 culminating in a ten day brigade level defensive exercises the first phase of the training was conducted at hohenfels training 
 area in bavaria hohenfels is a historic training site dating back as far as the 1930s and the ranges are 
 still covered with debris from that era and from exercise ww ii in which most present nato and warsaw pact 
 members took part in the late stages of that training evolution it was used as a prisoner of war camp 
 run by the germans who placed second in the exercise in may 1945 the gates of hohenfels were opened and 
 the incarcerated soldiers were released since then nato allies have returned to the largest manoeuvre area in germany for annual 
 training even 4 cmbg starring 2 ppcli makes this annual trek the first two weeks of hohenfels were spent reviewing 
 company and combat team operations this training included section and platoon up downs sneaking and peeking and work d up 
 to fully mechanized leopard chasing at the company level once the work up period of training was completed the battalion 
 moved out into the restricted manoeuvre area rma which is in fact the west german countryside itself in this phase 
 fully mechanized road rallying was emphasized it was here that recce platoon found that their german vocabulary of gum gum 
 and flavour flavour was insufficient and further vocabulary was issued such as window speed spacing and beamer bashing b company

 during this period all vehicles and soldiers were issued with miles equipment to make the training more realistic the final 
 phase of training was a ten day defensive exercise conducted in the gerrman countryside it was here that the battalion 
 learned that people really do dig in in germany regardless 0:re 0:gardless of what rumours fly around in canada the

 32 second battalion sports by lieutenant m pretty the keen competitive edge and spirit of the second battalion was very 
 evident in the 1985 sports year the year started on a high with our hockey team the rebels winning the 
 canadian forces europe hockey championship by overcoming the van doo citadelle in a closely contested final game the two teams 
 went the full five games with the rebels winning the first two in overtime and the fifth game by a 
 score of 9 7 to become the new champions of the league the inter company sports programme was both intense 
 and rigorous the companies competed in sports such as flag football floor and ice hockey baseball seven aside rugby volleyball 
 and soccer the french grey cup was again contested for in appropriate weather last year we had the fog bowl 
 this year we had the snow bowl this has now become a tradition in 2 pp and congratulations go to 
 the rsm for ordering the weather combat support company and the newly arrived deltoids of d company battled through one 
 and one half feet of snow 1 weather fog and a blizzard combat support company was victorious 8 0 and 
 also won the trophy for the best float the honour of miss french grey cup went to the lovely lady 
 from c company the annual 4 cmbg sports meet was a big success our track and field team made significant 
 progress but it was still not enough to end the ir22er reign of 11 years 2 pp finished second with 
 180 points and ir22er with 195 to remain brigade champions the unit rugby team the baden bayonets did quite well 
 last year in the us forces rugby league and has a good shot at the finals this year the bayonets 
 also visited 3 rgj in celle but suffered a loss of 6 0 possibly because their hosts ambushed them the 
 night before the unit volleyball team is doing well in its first year of league play and is expected to 
 give the boys from lahr a run for their money the past year also saw the unit soccer team the 
 kanadisher kickers achieve considerable success the first highlight of their season came during the most impressive performance at the amateur 
 world cup held in holland the team placed 14th out of 96 competitors the best showing ever by a canadian 
 team in this tournament the kickers easily won the 4 cmbg league championship 0:champion 0:ship with a record of 18 
 wins and no losses the battalion team augmented by a few players from base baden then won the cfe regional 
 playoffs and the right to represent europe in the cf national championship the kickers after much hard work and many 
 anxious moments returned home from canada as cf champions all in all at all levels of competition the year in 
 sports has been a resounding success for the unit the achievements of all have greatly contributed to the morale and

 3 ppcli a year of change 1985 for the third battalion princess patricia s canadian light infantry was a year 
 of change what changed you ask well just about everything but the weather those familiar with our humble abode here 
 in victoria know that sunshine is constant as attested by 48 days without rain during the summer months a surprise 
 snowfall in november did not last long enough to turn the grass brown in january winter exercise in chilcotin was 
 cancelled and companies were forced to head to the northern portion of vancouver island to find snow before the soldiers 
 could air out their parkas and mukluks they were issued the new infantry webbing in preparation for ry 85 ry 
 85 of course epitomized the year s changes work dress to combats houses to tents and cars to avgps to 
 name but a few a change of command parade followed in july lcol merv mcmurray said farewell to the battalion 
 handing command over to lcol tony anderson hot on the heels of that was a personnel change of major proportions 
 when the battalion s a coy was sent to germany to support our nato commitment many new soldiers arrived from 
 the battle school and other parts of canada to fill the void amidst this evolutionary environment it was noted that 
 one other thing besides the weather has not changed at 3 ppcli their commitment to excellence which continues to flourish

 the name entails this year s winter exercise was held in an alternate location from that originally planned unable to 
 run a battalion winter exercise on the mainland in chilcotin we opted for a company level exercise up island in 
 the area of ml washington where much to everyone s surprise the snow was in abundance exercise dates tied in 
 comfortably with the brigade ski school which was also being run in that location many of the soldiers had the 
 opportunity to get in some downhill skiing when not engulfed in winter warfare the thick forests deep snow and frozen

 since the armoured defence platoon and corps of drums amalgamation for the majority of the soldiers it meant a dual 
 role tow gunner or track driver and bandsman timetables were hard to adjust at first but now all training exercises 
 performances and taskings are met without too much difficulty as soon as both organizations were joined we went on a 
 winter exercise in forbidden plateau on vancouver island where they got acquainted with pulling toboggans up and down steep mountains 
 in the spring of 1985 with a new strength of over 40 and only one third of the platoon qualified 
 tow we had to run a basic tow gunner course because of the dual role we ran band practice in 
 the morning and the tow course in the afternoon with lots of flexibility and patience everything went well with 15 
 newly quaified tow gunners armoured defence platoon was ready to go to ry 85 in wainwright for over a month 
 and a half we trained as adp on two battalion exercises we were enemy force we also did heliborne operations 
 and even provided a protection party for the commanding officer on top of all the training our instruments were brought 
 up and band practice took place a couple of hours a week the drum line performed numerous times for different 
 mess dinners in the field a drum head service was conducted in the battalion bivouac area and a mini tattoo 
 was done in conjunction with the ppcli regimental band and the 3 rcr pipes and drums near the end of 
 ry 85 more hours were devoted to band practice in preparation for the 3 ppcli change of command and the 
 calgary stampede there was no lack of hardware for the sat this year on the 4th of july the 32 
 member corps of drums performed for the change of command parade soon after the parade they did a free style 
 performance for the guests and then flew to calgary to be part of the greatest show on earth at the 
 calgary stampede 1985 in calgary they performed as many as three times a day much to the pleasure of the 
 stampede organization committee after leave in august they were back in their uniforms for the 2 cdo freedom of the 
 city in ottawa upon return from ottawa the posting season saw three of our best performers get posted to germany 
 with 2 ppcli we also lost all our track drivers either to germany or to gagetown in fall of 1985 
 we ran a driver track course the course went very well and even got to go to yakima firing centre

 44 third battalion brings home gold by corporal g savard the third battalion ppcli small arms team departed for wainwright 
 on the 13th day of july and trained on the ranges until the 26th of july prior to participating in 
 the canadian forces small arms competition at connaught ranges in ottawa the team faced certain challenges during their training such 
 as the extreme heat different lighting conditions and various wind changes at camp wainwright this proved to be to their 
 advantage in the long run because similar conditions occurred during the competition in ottawa there was not much time to 
 see the sights in the country s capital for the team members since a busy schedule was ahead for each 
 man the preliminaries included zeroing practices for all weapons before the big event took place among the team s noteworthy 
 accomplishments in the competition were 12 men placing in the top 50 shooters in winning the letson trophy sgt steve 
 hitchcock placed fifth and pte barry ferguson placed sixth our 12 man letson team consists of sgt hitchcock mcpl mullen 
 sgt trelnuk mcpl whaley cpl pearce cpl savard pte ferguson re soroka pte leedham pte miller pte maclaren re coish 
 the last time the ppcli won the letson trophy was in 1977 all 12 members will wear the letson rifle 
 on their uniforms for the remainder of their career there is presently only 14 letson rifles in the battalion itself

 57 2 airborne commando lieutenant e m thorson nineteen eighty five proved to be a busy and productive year for 
 2 commando members of the unit took part in training from the high arctic to the panama jungle with a 
 number of stops in between the year s training began with a winter battle school in petawawa which covered the 
 usual round of basic winter warfare training conventional ranges and field firing an added and important feature of the 1985 
 battle school was practice in construction of expedient shelters using natural materials airborne after the winter battle school the snow 
 hardly had time to settle before the commando along with the rest of the airborne regiment began preparations for a 
 radical change from cold weather operations this time it was to be desert training in fort bliss texas the exercise 
 began in early march with a jump into the desert to conduct a united nations style peace keeping operation as 
 practice for a possible un emergency mission the regiment was deployed between two wartorn nations to keep vital installations neutral 
 demonstrate un control of a demilitarized zone and to control guerillas the next phase in texas was a desert survival 
 school the commandos were taught what to eat and not to eat how to find water and how to construct 
 shelter the test came in the form of a two day survival scheme movement was kept to a minimum in 
 the heat of the day as the soldiers laid up in spiders holes dug into the floor of the desert 
 among the items on the menu cactus wild rhubarb and hares despite the best efforts of the commandos no snakes 
 were eaten mcpl plantz in the better vie the survival school was followed by a commando exercise in the form 
 of escape and evasion training again movement was kept to a minimum by day as section sized groups moved in 
 darkness to platoon rendezvous the enemy force was composed of american tanks and helicopters some of which were equipped with 
 thermal imaging devices this technological advantage meant that field craft choice of routes and vigilance had to be of the 
 highest standard both day and night in all 2 commando covered about 50 miles the final phase in texas saw 
 2 commando deployed as part of a regimental operation on to drop zone desperation in this case the enemy was 
 the us 9th infantry division s high tech brigade armed with m6o machine guns tow missiles and grenade launchers mounted 
 on fast attack vehicles dune buggies the regiment was initially deployed to ambush an enemy advance and after the ambush 
 moved up to help hold forward positions alongside the us 3rd armoured regiment the ambushes were very effective in one 
 case 12 riflemen with a gpmg were credited with knocking out a company of fast attack vehicles the exercise was 
 nearing its conclusion when 2 commando was released to infiltrate enemy rear areas and conduct raids and ambushes once more 
 with great success this time the enemy brigade intelligence cell was captured intact the unknown commando before leaving texas the 
 airborne regiment marched through the streets of el paso to receive the freedom of the city after 48 hours of 
 well deserved r r deep in the heart of texas the regiment was on its way home to prepare for

 58 within two weeks of returning from texas the regiment had cleaned up reloaded and moved off to dundurn for 
 the first part of rvbs training was devoted to field firing on expedient ranges built by the troops in the 
 rolling saskatchewan parkland the highlight of 2 commando s training was the last 50 meters of a live fire assault 
 course modelled after a soviet style defensive position with special permission from defence headquarters to reduce safety limits the commando 
 was able to conduct a live fire exercise that was as realistic as possible in peace time home made bangalore 
 torpedos were used to breech the barbed wire m 72 rockets and 84mm anti tank rockets were used for bunker 
 busting while small teams cleared the enemy trench complex corner by corner using live grenades covered by close in overhead 
 machine gun and light mortar fire after the intense live fire training the commando emerged from dundurn confident and ready 
 to take on the rest of the army single handed after staging out of saskatoon international airport the commando 0:com

 years the battle school entered 1985 with a full slate of courses what with summer taskings and major exercises the 
 tq3 and leadership courses are pushed into the prime and lovely training months of september through to march thus winter 
 1985 saw the battle school with from six to eight courses at any one time which peaked in march with 
 346 people on strength as posted or increment staff and students the battle school took part in the camp wainwright 
 winter carnival at the end of january doing very well and winning the overall competition each platoon took on a 
 major event which saw some excellent results especially in the skit and snow sculpture events the headquarters staff did their 
 part by taking on the events that required competitors during training hours the battle school observed the regimental day by 
 conducting a sports competition which saw north west europe platoon winning all the sports events the traditional broom i loo 
 game was played with the senior ncos once again using their overwhelming numbers and weight to trounce the officers the 
 number of candidates from the battle school going to the career courses in gagetown resulted in the ci going back

 comd pausing after giving words of wisdom to his platoon team at the regimental day sports competition ry 85 brigade 
 headquarters directed that the battle school would have no increment staff during ry 85 so the timings of all courses 
 were adjusted to allow positions to be filled by permanent staff this resulted in a reduced course load during ry 
 which was further reduced as we waited for the ytep platoons to graduate from cornwallis consequently some buildings were empty 
 and were immediately snapped up by the umpires even with this reduced load during most of the spring three platoons 
 were in training at any one time this combined with the number of senior officers in the area provided an 
 opportunity to have a number of these senior officers review graduation parades we also took advantage of the presence of 
 the regimental and unit bands to have music for many of our graduation parades bgen reay was the first of 
 many senior officers to be reviewing officer when he inspected the graduation parade for gothic line 8411 and rimini line 
 8412 on 3 april and on 4 april he was reviewing officer for the joint parade of the combat leaders 
 course 8501 and the infantry section commanders course 8501 other reviewing officers during ry 85 included colonel mackenzie from fmchq

 the battle school conference room which was followed by the louis scott cock o the walk competition as the shoot

 the summer block leave the courses started to add up as the two direct entry courses started and the ytep 
 courses arrived from cornwallis the battle school strength rapidly increased until mid september when for a two week period there 
 were 10 platoons and a strength at 487 during most of the fall the battle school had 9 platoons and 
 a strength of over 400 the instructors had interesting working conditions as quonset huts were used as lecture buildings and 
 the available training aids travelled from platoon to platoon without getting a chance to cool off on the shelves some 
 relief from this load was provided by the meet and greet in october and the men s christmas dinner those 
 of us who had not been here for the first ytep in 1983 84 were somewhat overtaken by the numbers 
 and the amount of work generated as the year closes we can look back with satisfaction at a full year 
 of successful training and forward to another year that for the next few months will be just as busy table

 presented the band with a few new challenges and surprises without a doubt the most important event was ry 85 
 for this exercise each member of the band was issued with combat clothing something which is not normally on our 
 scale of issue as we are not considered to be in a field trade but in the mud and dust 
 of wainwright it sure made sense our part in ry 85 involved a lot of mess dinners graduation parades change 
 of command parades and of course the huge divisional parade on june 4th for that we really appreciated the assistance 
 of the rcr band from gagetown and the drum and bugle bands of i and 111 ppcli without them it 
 would have been a lot more painful as it was the most notable part of the parade was the helicopter 
 full of photographers which hovered about twentyfive 0:twenty 0:five feet overhead scattering music far and wide and nearly knocking us 
 off our feet we had to tear ourselves away from wainwright at the end of may for a weekend in 
 yellowknife there aided by the snowbirds and skyhawks we helped the citizens celebrate armed forces weekend and they in turn 
 showed us what northern hospitality is all about during the rest of the summer we did change of command parades 
 including one in victoria for 111 ppcli guards of honour for the governor general and for her majesty the queen 
 mother and a number of public concerts we bid farewell to two longtime members of the band last summer wo 
 pete jemus and sgt ed devroom pete started out in the patricias 28 years ago as a paratrooper and joined 
 the band seven years later since that time he has been an important and valued member of the trombone section 
 as well as adding a lot to our concert programmes with his vocals we hear that he has settled in 
 very well in chilliwack running their station band after a career of 32 years in the ppcli band sgt eddie 
 devroom stepped into civilian life ed was recruited as a saxophone playerin holland in 1953 and spent his entire career 
 with the band he is well known around the base as a runner with participation in many running events to 
 his credit including the 1981 montreal marathon he can now add cycling to his training thanks to a 15 speed 
 mountain bike presented to him by the band at his retirement bash in february of last year we were visited 
 by commander george morrison cd director of bands comdr morrison heard the band perform in concert inspected the band on

 67 serving on the east coast by major r r f burns what is the ppcli doing way down here 
 these are familiar words which i hear on a fairly regular basis in halifax and other east coast towns and 
 cities either that comment or as i travel around the 18 bases and stations in atlantic canada some airman sailor 
 log type clerk or ma will rush up and say what battalion are you with as they encounter probably the 
 first patricia they have seen since they left the regiment on posting and or remuster the chances of this happening 
 both at military bases and on the city streets are of course greatly increased in the autumn when we put 
 our tunics on with our familiar shoulder titles and before we put on great coats or parkas they all miss 
 the regiment particularly the feeling of family they had there which does not exist for them in their new trade 
 or appointment it reminds me of how much we take for granted in the regiment and also just how few 
 of us there are down here outside the confines of gagetown and cornwallis some of us are fortunate to be 
 in pairs both here at maritime command hq and at atlantic militia area hq although the 2lt here is really 
 only stranded for a year between phases others serve on alone at the fleet school at cfb halifax at cfb 
 greenwood and with rss at st john s nfld amherst ns and kentville ns now the navy is not the 
 place where one usually finds things regimental so i feel very fortunate to have found a very valuable although somewhat 
 unlikely regimental connection in the person of commodore retd wp hayes i had previously met him some years ago when 
 he was the commandant of the cf staff college and i was a student but only recently discovered that he 
 was a personal friend of our founder and of course mrs gault he met them and became a close friend 
 through an interesting series of events beginning in england in 1939 this association continues as commodore and mrs hayes visited 
 hatch court just last year with the nations who carry on the family tradition there commodore hayes has kindly agreed 
 to prepare a piece for next year s patrician recounting the interesting and very personal memories and anecdotes of his 
 times with hammie i am particularly indebted to him for undertaking this task as there are few around who personally 
 knew the founder plus the added interest of seeing him and in a sense the regiment from a different perspective 
 through a sailor s eyes so there you have it a brief report from a westerner serving down home on 
 the east coast and while there are not many of us out here we do manage to get around and 
 are delighted to discover to discover that the regiment is known in some pretty unlikely spots ctc and cfb gagetown

 earlier that day to some members of the small arms course the brigadier remarked the air force has never changed 
 it took them thirty minutes to fly out there and five minutes to get back the ride out was for 
 flight pay and the ride in was for dinner the next morning at 0900 hrs all patricias and ex serving 
 members from nova scotia to quebec assembled in the drill hall the french grey battalion with the camp flag present

 zero temperature all ranks warmed their linings with some good old fashioned moose milk while waiting for the start of 
 the traditional broom i loo games general de lalanne dropped the ball to start the games but not before he 
 made sure both centremen had their sticks firmly on the ground as usual that was the last time the sticks 
 touched the ground during the games general de lalanne was able to chat with some of the wives in attendance

 tilt due to the large ytep program in house on the 17th of march fifteen of us plus three retired 
 patricia s from the area joined the patricia s from ctc in gagetown for the regimental celebrations the festivities included 
 a meet and greet in the wos and sgts mess on arrival where old friends were re acquainted the major 
 event took place the following day on the soccer field for what else but the traditional snr nco s beat 
 the officers broom i loo game this year was no different as the snr nco s from cornwallis and ctc 
 joined forces to administer a devastating blow to the officers following the tournament it was back to the mess to 
 hear more tall tales and war stories over a few cool ones and make plans for the dance and banquet 
 that night the banquet was held in the oromocto legion and there were 250 plus patricia s in attendance a 
 gathering of this magnitude was refreshing and brings home the true meaning of regimental family a good time was had

 74 loyal edmonton regiment 4 ppcli airborne platoon effective 1 sep 84 the unit was tasked to maintain a 27 
 man platoon ready at short notice to operationally support 2 cdo of the canadian airborne regiment the platoon continues to 
 function at full strength and at a furious rate fortunately our location just several hundred yards away from the canadian 
 airborne center allows us to maintain a close working relationship with the parachute training wing this in turn produces tremendous 
 advantages to our parachutists including the ability to get in jumps with every j stage of the basic para crse 
 and the ability to have candidates for this erse available on a stand by basis in addition to our normal 
 erse vacancies mwo rw johnston with members of the airborne platoon the entire platoon took part in several practice tactical 
 night jumps into camp wainwright which culminated in a night descent to capture cattallo bridge during a northern alberta militia 
 district ftx later in the year they again did a night assault into wainwright during a joint exercise with elements 
 of 2 cdo and the royal westminster regiment some of the platoon are getting to be on a first name 
 basis with the higher branches of individual trees at wainwright a number of the platoon were fortunate enough to be 
 attached to 2 cdo for a month long exercise in texas the only let down of the year was when 
 suggestions that the platoon participate in a limited way in a canadian airborne regiment tactical exercise during ry 85 fell 
 on deaf ears sgt l hartenberger with airborne platoon sgt hartenberger was one of three unit members on the 1985 
 sky hawks parachute team band during the past two years the unit brass and reed band has flourished under the 
 guidance of director of music lt colin bonneau colin a school teacher in his civilian life took over the band 
 when they were so low in numbers that they had to be combined with the band of 418 air reserve 
 squadron for any performance the band now numbers 25 musicians who are also fully trained infantrymen infantrywomen in some cases 
 they keep a very full schedule of concerts and parades including the opening of the provincial legislature and ceremonial parades 
 or mess functions for practically every unit at cfb edmonton several members were attached to the ppcli band in calgary 
 this past summer they most certainly enjoyed the posting and the individual reports received back indicated that the regimental band 
 likewise appreciated their participation work is progressing to raise money to put the entire band into proper scarlet uniforms during 
 1986 this may be greatly helped by indications from the provincial government to designate the band as the official provincial 
 band which would result in some monies from government grants other groups have also indicated their willingness to donate so 
 look for their debut before next fall capt matthews a coy capt cars ted r wpg r maj rice a 
 coy and believe it or not lt bonneau director of music at mil con 85 prince of wales armoury the 
 unit s home from shortly after the first world war until the 1960 s was the prince of wales armoury 
 in downtown edmonton there was a short time at ortona armoury in the river valley and then the move to 
 our present quarters at hamilton gault barracks within cfb edmonton we are now sandwiched into administrative offices along with the 
 militia district headquarters staff and every other unit in the district political sleight of hand between the three levels of 
 government has resulted in the armoury being the property of the city of edmonton but also being designated a provincial 
 historical building which precludes any structural changes to its appearance you would be surprised how few civilian uses there are 
 for an armoury if you can not make structural changes the biggest users are the edmonton food bank and sunday 
 flea markets 
 75 our new honorary lieutenant colonel lcol ed l boyd cd spear headed the formation of the prince of wales 
 armoury foundation which has maintained a continuous pressure on both the military as well as the political chain of command 
 to have the dnd agree to leasing back at least part of the armoury for militia use guess which unit 
 he is pushing to move there we seem to have lost the initial battle a fmc report was not favorable 
 but detractors don t know ed boyd not for nothing does a man serve alongside fellow officers like george brown 
 jim stone and owen browne through such battles as the liri valley rimini line and ortona colonel boyd is now 
 well underway in his second assault which has so far included a private interview with the associate minister of national 
 defence the city of edmonton has offered the foundation a lease on the building the only thing holding things up 
 is one major tenant to pay a lion s share of the rent if the dnd comes through other tenants 
 would include the united services institute various cadet corps and a military museum hon lcol and co speaking to unit

 and now the loyal edmonton regiment was moving by train to eastern canada prior to going overseas a stop was 
 made at lestock saskatchewan while at this stop a coyote puppy was handed in with a card around its neck 
 asking that it be accepted as a mascot in a reply to the donor colonel griesbach wrote it is perhaps 
 singularly fitting that we should have a coyote as a mascot after all he is an animal which is to 
 be found all over our western country and although he has a somewhat shady reputation the fact remains that while 
 other wild animals have retreated before the march of civilization the coyote of western canada is doing business as usual 
 perhaps it may be that after the march of german kultur has spent itself it will be found that this 
 regiment has been dilligent in its business and will be found sticking around western canada again like our friend the 
 coyote needless to say the coyote puppy was accepted and christened lestock in september prior to the 49th leaving england

 he lived a long and happy life lcol marshall contemplates proper military procedure when finding a frozen coyote on one

 a good improvement over last year and the band is progressing slowly the corps at present is looking for a 
 band officer the corps was privileged to have been able to send two of its cil officers and a senior 
 cadet to the keremeos outwardbound camp to attend the mountain school and the cross country ski school our annual inspection 
 parade turned out to be very good with interesting static displays and an excellent display by the cadets on the 
 rappelling tower all cadets that wished to attend camp in 85 were able to go and we are looking forward 
 to many cadets attending summer camps this year the parade for major general quinn colonel commandant of the royal canadian 
 army cadets which took place at cfb calgary harvey barracks on 17 june 1985 was attended by all army cadet

 has had another full year with activities ranging from a major exercise in denmark to an operational tour in the 
 falkland islands throughout the year we have remained based at tidworth in hampshire as part of the united kingdom mobile 
 force ukmf in september the battalion went to denmark for three weeks to take part in a nato exercise ex 
 bold gannet this involved a work up period in jutland followed by an exercise on the island of zealand in 
 a truly multinational exercise we were attacked by american aircraft german helibourne troops danish and dutch marines and fought alongside 
 a danish mechanised brigade for many riflemen this was the first time they had trained over normal countryside outside designated 
 military training areas and the added realism this gave coupled with the generous hospitality of the danes made ex bold 
 gannet a very fitting climax to our first year with the ukmf after a short leave we set off in 
 october for a five month tour in the falkland islands the advance party travelled on the airbridge involving a 13 
 hour trip in a hercules including in flight refuelling while the main body moved on a converted north sea ferry 
 from ascension island in the falklands we were deployed with battalion headquarters at goose green three other company bases on 
 west and east falklands and a detachment in south georgia 800 miles away it was quickly apparent how lucky we 
 were to be on a summer tour although the wind rarely drops and there is little shelter it was far 
 warmer than we had anticipated and the hostile weather conditions we had expected only occasionally affected our activities apart from 
 the operational commitments of guards and reaction forces we were able to patrol extensively around the islands meeting and getting 
 to know many of the locals we were able to carry out some ambitious training projects which included a 48 
 hour platoon assessment exercise for each platoon and a live firing exercise for each company which culminated in a deliberate 
 attack supported by harriers naval gunfire and the mortar platoon our tour finished in march 1985 and we sailed back 
 to ascension island on the ss uganda an old p and o educational cruise ship since our return we have 
 been running a period of individual training and our programme is now geared towards spearhead duties in october and an 
 exercise in kenya in january 1986 2 royal green jackets commanding officer lieutenant colonel j p o beddard mbe our 
 last report ended with a preview of exercise lionheart the event turned out to be a mixed bag for 2 
 rcj after a gallant defence of a certain village and its surrounding woodlands by massed attacks from german dutch and 
 american armour the exercise directors considered that a report of calais had occured instead of going into pow cages the 
 battalion motored to the rear but for us the war was over the autumn of 1984 was taken up with 
 cadres 85 riflemen started a jnco s cadre with 40 receiving their tapes at the end of eight hard weeks 
 christmas was celebrated in minden in the traditional way with the outgoing qm major brian hill after 6 years in 
 the chair surpassing even his own high standards the winter also saw the skiing team once again winning the daily 
 telegraph cup and with the help of lcpl dobson in particular maintaining their position on the highest placed infantry team 
 in the competition sadly new years was the last performance of our own band was it just that because they 
 were going we felt they had never played so well the members of the band have gone different ways the 
 largest number to the peninsula band in celle chifton barracks is a sadder and quieter place without them for 1985 
 the main challenge of the training year was the 2 rgj battlegroup s visit to canada for exercise medicine man 
 2 early in the year we gathered our team together armour from 3rd royal tank regiment guns from 3rd field 
 battery and sappers from hameln and any number of individuals to make up the 1000 odd strong battlegroup hard training 
 in trying conditions at soltau together with meticulous planning by the movers and administrators under capt qm chad lacey brought 
 us to canada in may to take part in this now familiar but none the less exciting 6 week exercise 
 by all accounts not just our own it was a resounding success and in particular showed the professionalism of the 
 young riflemen in the battalion let no one say that standards have fallen while in canada a number of contacts 
 were made with ppcli officers and senior ranks in calgary more if exercise ry 85 had not been underway but 
 with capt duane domanko as 2ic of d coy we had little difficulty establishing contact canada took away most of 
 the battalion though a rump of c company remained behind to make the most of the adventure training at stiebis 
 the joint berlin light division skiing and mountaineering 0:moun 0:taineering centre in bavaria run by capt eddie bright on the 
 sporting front the battalion efforts have been curtailed especially in the team sports by the heavy training commitment the boxing 
 team however hoping to exchange last year s runner up trophy for this year s champion s shield were the 
 highest hope for a major sporting success sadly the championship was denied them on a technical decision but the team 
 made up for it by getting three winners and one runner up in the baor individual competition being placed third 
 in the army championship and providing the coach and half the team members for the baor team lcpl lee was 
 selected as a member of the army team that won the inter services boxing while the judo team came third 
 in the army championship with such excellent results the second battalion is well proud of its fighters both boxers and 
 judoists in the less well known sports a number of successes must also be recorded not least lcpl leach s 
 time of 2 hrs 45 mins in the vienna marathon the fastest british runner in the race and major pearson 
 s championship of the infantry boardsailing in the novice class the battalion says farewell to lt col beddard and welcomes 
 back lt col hayes as co colonel jon and his wife felicity leave for england with the battalion in very 
 good heart a wives club in top form and with the best wishes of us all the future holds the 
 prospect of a winter in northern ireland a return to our old stomping ground in west belfast together with the 
 build up training under the northern ireland training and advisory team nitat baor commanded by 
 79 maj hearn lately oc c company it will be a busy winter but our last in germany as the 
 battalion takes up the role of demonstration battalion at the school of infantry warminster in august 1986 3 royal green 
 jackets commanding officer lieutenant colonel c b q wallace obe the 3rd battalion has now been stationed in germany for 
 three years with only two years of the tour remaining the battalion is based on the outskirts of celle one 
 of northern germany s most picturesque towns maintaining a strong historical connection with the british royal family the pace of 
 life in germany remains hectic and so it was with some relief that the battalion was warned for an operational 
 tour in northern ireland mid way through our tour here some 40 of the battalion had previously served in the 
 province but this percentage included few of our riflemen who looked forward to the avi month tour with some anticipation 
 training commenced in mid june 1984 when our apcs were handed over to the rear party prior to three weeks 
 block leave a short period of internal security training took place within barracks after an interesting week of presentations by 
 the northern ireland training and advisory team nitat atthe same time members of the battalion attended numerous courses preparing them 
 for the very different tasks ahead of them returning to work at the beginning of august we launched into an 
 intensive training programme culminating in three weeks training at sennelager training centre which ended with the interplatoon 0:inter 0:platoon competition 
 the tarleton trophy on 4th october 1984 at 1600 hours 3 rgj assumed operational control of the west belfast taor 
 after an absence of ten years within two hours of arrival we had recovered a weapon although the situation has 
 changed considerably from the tours of the early 19705 the terrorist is still very much in evidence and just a 
 fortnight after our arrival we suffered one fatal casualty and one severely wounded in a highly professional and well executed 
 ira ambush two weeks before the end of the tour we had an opportunity to redress the balance when the 
 ira attempted a less professional ambush the battalion suffered no casualties and a successful follow up led to the arrest 
 of one of the gunmen and the possible wounding of another one of the weapons used in the ambush was 
 also recovered the tour ended in mid february 1985 and the battalion was able to take three weeks well earned 
 leave before returning to their mechanised role in germany since our return we have been busy reminding ourselves of mechanised 
 training participating in a divisional cpx ex morning glory in april and a period of field firing at sennelager training 
 centre during may which culminated in a brigade live firing exercise on hohne ranges the battalion looks forward to a 
 busy year ahead with further battle group mechanised training and a brigade ftx 4 royal green jackets commanding officer lieutenant 
 colonel p j lyddon mbe 1985 for 4 rgj has been a year of extremes we have had a hectic 
 demanding and enjoyable year in which the conflicting demands for change and stability have given the battalion much to chew 
 on and much to do the training has been of necessity geared to the demands of serving an armoured brigade 
 in baor coupled with the competing attractions of ta life in london and oxford annual camp saw us exercising and 
 field firing at otterburn we exchanged a 150 strong company of green jackets with b coy 2nd bn 130 th 
 infantry regiment the illinois national guard who did much to enliven our lives our company spent two very enjoyable weeks 
 at fort mccoy wisconsin with no one feeling homesick for otterburn at all the exchange was highly regarded by all 
 taking part with many useful and interesting lessons military social and lingual being learnt on both sides despite the american 
 connection our links with 12th armoured brigade were not allowed to grow rusty despite our being unable to train in 
 baor as a battalion in 1984 we were able to send watchkeepers on several formation cpxs the commanding officer lieutenant 
 colonel p j lyddon mbe managed to persuade 0:per 0:suade the brigade staff to come back from germany and run 
 a logistics study day on our behalf needless to say the attractions of the subject and the lure of a 
 weekend back in the uk for the presenters made the occasion a great success success or near success on the 
 field of sport has come 4 rgj s way we came second in superior style but with less goals in 
 the london district football and were inexplicably pipped into second place by the same opponents in the six a side 
 as well this year we hope our rivals 269 commando battery will be looking less pleased with themselves and our 
 company teams will be training hard the battalion skiing team ably lead by captain tony marvin came second overall in 
 the ta competition at aviemore this success was well celebrated on the occasion by the other members of the team 
 who hope to acquit themselves as well if not better in the next competition shooting has been a high priority 
 this year a keenly fought battalion rifle meeting in october 1984 at pirbright laid the groundwork for better shooting in 
 the future we have high hopes for that elusive animal bisley success with a young team who came a promising 
 second in the district ta saam this year if the year past has been busy and fulfilling the year ahead 
 contains much to be getting on with there is 5 rgj to be raised we are off to camp at 
 soltau in october and a new training year to get to grips with yet with all these challenges we will 
 be bent on ensuring that life remains fun for that is what ta soldiering is all about may we take 
 this opportunity to extend a welcome to any of our affiliated regiments who have anyone coming to london we are 
 particularly lucky in having lt alan patterson with us at the moment from the 6th bn hauraki royal new zealand

 80 light division depot winchester commanding officer lieutenant colonel m k om dewar 1984 closed with the depot going through 
 a particularly busy patch as platoons of between 70 and 80 recruits were forming up regularly the trend has continued 
 into 1985 but the difference now is that the platoons are even bigger the largest forming up in june at 
 115 recruits at one point training company exceeded the figure of 380 ranks and although that total has now subsided 
 somewhat there appears to be no let up in the vast influxes of recruits from the recruiting offices there have 
 been large and significant changes in the faces around the depot over the last 12 months lt col peter chamberlin 
 handed over command to lt col mike dewar during a snowbound passing out parade in january in which winter blizzards 
 forced the parade to be held in the gymnasium rather than the normal ceremony on the square the rsm wol 
 taylor was towed out of barracks in a speedboat in april after handing over to wol brennan we have also 
 received a 2 i c onto the establishment in the form of major john wykeham who on arrival in his 
 office has set about co ordinating the training programme for our new barracks at flowerdown passing out parades have seen 
 a variety of guests including general mostyn the divisional brigadier brigadier lowe and our recently departed quartermaster lt col john 
 lane who put on his greens for perhaps the last time before going into retirement in kent a busy social 
 programme has been in action in july the depot stopped everything to put on the final sounding of retreat to 
 be held in peninsula barracks the week was a tremendous success and apart from all the social activities in the 
 messes the performances 0:per 0:formances were watched by unprecedented crowds on two of the three nights the gates had to 
 be closed to prevent the barracks from overflowing we also held a depot sports day in july at which teams 
 drawn from all corners of the depot competed in egg and spoon races throwing the cricket ball and throwing the 
 welly traditional sports involving the conventional forms of running leaping and throwing were relegated firmly to the imagination also entered 
 in the unusual occurrences register is the first ever official photograph of the personnel of the light division depot winchester 
 a depot parade was held at the beginning of july and after the adjutant and rsm had spent half an 
 hour trying to obtain an aesthetic balance to the picture by marching troops hither and thither the photographer snapped a 
 notable first unlike battalions who measure their year very often by where they have been we as a static unit 
 and home of the regiment measure our calendar more by people and events in this sense 1985 has seen a 
 major event in the process of turning winchester into the home of the light division and not merely the royal 
 green jackets in april the regimental headquarters of the light infantry moved into peninsula barracks from shrewbury so setting in 
 train an ongoing series of events that will eventually end with the total amalgamation of the two regimental depots a 
 process which will continue to gather pace throughout the year to all canadian soldiers past and present we are proud 
 to say yesterday training for war essential to be specialized as a soldier what are we fighting for the old 
 belief fighting for our country what does it mean freedom kiss us goodbye standing in a hole six feet x 
 two feet x chest deep waiting for the enemy as a soldier what are we fighting for remember the good 
 times riding the first bike being only six years old freedom protect us enemy meets enemy to remain alive as 
 a soldier what are we fighting for the girl that is four those wild brown eyes innocent not knowing the 
 future freedom god hear our prayers battle in a new land personal conflict to live again as a soldier what
