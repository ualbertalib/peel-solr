 regimental notes winnipeg station p p c l i at winnipeg in conjunction with all other units of the defence 
 forces in m d no lo paraded at the legislative buildings on 12th may to take part in the ceremonies 
 0:cere 0:monies held in connection with the coronation of his majesty king george 71 the parade was under the command 
 of col d s macßdy obe vd officer commanding 20th infantry brigade units assembled at the market square and then 
 marched via main street portaso aye memorial bculovadc osborne street a salute of 21 guns was fired by c bty 
 r c h a owing to the fact that nine members of the band were away at the coronation in 
 england it was not possible to troop the colour this year in commemoration of tho battle of frezenberg as an 
 alternative the commanding officer called a parade on the football field at which tho colour was carried by lieut c 
 b ware and after the general salute and inspection by the co lie reminded all present of tho significance of 
 the day in tho history of the regiment the parade then marched back to barracks and proceeded to consume the 
 odd barrel of beer this was the first time that the a company bugle band had played on a parade 
 with the colours thoy made a first class job of their playing and all present hope they continue to toot 
 on route marches etc on may 9th tho regiment attended all s lnts church i or the annual ioimontal cliurch 
 parade tho parade was joined at the hudson s b y store by members of tho patricia club and proceeded 
 to the cenotaph where last post wr s sounded and a wreath deposited by the commanding officer after the service 
 at all saints church the d o c m d no lo took tho salute oad the troops returned to 
 barracks 64 
 65 the annual doc oration day parade was held on the 23rd may and once againe p p c l 
 i were on parade and marching all around the town on the 28th may the unit proceeded to shilo camp 
 man by train arriving there at 1400 hours the camp went along very smoothly until just after supper on the 
 23rd june when one of tho most if not the most violent wind sand rain and thunder storms in the 
 history of manitoba struck the camp in ton minutes only one tent was left standing a company orderly room which 
 was housed in a wooden hut 10 a 12 feet landed in the sergeants mess water tank about 100 foot 
 away and the roof landed squarely on the road a further 25 feet last fortunately no serious casualties were caused 
 amongst the patricias those who w ere at 3t charles in 1923 admit that the storm there was nothing on 
 the one we had on tho 23rd at the time of nam tin these notes the weather is extremely hot 
 and a strong south easterly hot wind is driving the sand into everything we own end it looks as if 
 a repetition cf the 83rd june may yet return last night sunday tiu 4th july the first of our travellers 
 left shilo for points west major carvosso lieut ware and 17 other ranks leaving for dunddrn camp where they will 
 operate from 6th to 19th july it is understood that a school for phat players is to v be organized 
 on british war establishment lines in the fall several members of the sergeants mess have applied for positions is instructors 
 but the general concensus of opinion is that pl should be candidates arid that we should import a westerner as 
 instructor members of the sergeants mess in winnipeg are losing a good friend in conor f higgins p c o 
 c who is leaving in a few days con ir higgins is w ell known to members of the regiment 
 at esquimalt and we know he will find many old faces waiting for him among the patricias sport at winnipeg

 they marched through the city to the cathedral headed by thoir pipes and drums at johnson street bridge they were

 rev dean quainton preached the sermon and referred eloquently to the proud record of the regiment and to tho solemn 
 thought and object behind the memorial service following tho service b 1 company and the ex patricias present paraded to 
 the war memorial outside the parliament buildings where lieut col m r ten brooke mc deposited a wreath in the 
 name of the regiment while pipers of b company played the lament the old comrades accompanied the parade back as 
 far as the johnson street bridge where they fell out while b company marched back to barracks mention must be 
 made here of the the excellent work of our pipe band last fall on our route march they lightened many 
 an otherwise weary mile and now on both the coronation parade and our annual church parade they did yeoman serod 
 ee we now have four pipes and six drums in the band which considering the fact that they get little 
 cr no opportunity for practice except in their spare time play very w ell together and do us credit whenever 
 they appear on may bth many members of 3 company gathered at the c p r docks to say good 
 bye to lieut col and mrs nivon who were leaving on an extended trip to the old country a large 
 crowd of their many friends in victoria also turned out to send with the travellers best wishes for a happy 
 crossing and a pleasant stay over there word has since been received that liout col pivon and his party have 
 landed in england after a calm and pleasant voyage and that they aire finding their new surroundings 0:sur 0:roundings to 
 their liking lieut sutherland became an apostle of the bren gun for a while during the late spring and made

 weather was nearly perfect 0:per 0:fect and much interesting training as carried out particularly 0:parti 0:cularly in exploring and comparing 
 the work of horsed and mechanized cavalry the infantry co operated in an overnight 0:over 0:night scheme with the mobile 
 troops at the end of the camp menawhile there were running concurrently eith the unit training camp schools of cavalry

 of course but this one was quite out of the ordinary run many of us saw for the first time 
 the mechanized cavalry tent pegging from motor cycles either single or side car models it made no difference no they 
 did not use swords thoy used bayonets and thoy got their pegs too incidentally the infantry placed well up in 
 the money in the mounted events wo are glad to announce the regimental land of the r m r was 
 in camp and played for mess later in the evening at retreat thoy stopped in deference to the time honoured 
 ceremony and groat was the amazement of the listeners when the call sounded forth it was undobtedly retreat one would 
 never deny that but with a difference it was played on a cavalry trumpet by one who shall be nameless 
 but who was quite clearly used to the good old bugle the result was quite novel not to say astonishing 
 nd we hear that it cost someone a lar e number of or refreshments later all the units in camp 
 were inspected by the district officer commanding before they returned to their home stations on may 31st abour eighty members 
 of esquimalt station moved to heals range preceded by an dvance party under lieut a e t paquet several improvements 
 have been made at heals this year including a new hut for o m stores another for ammunition stores andm 
 last but not least a healthy addition to the canteen building the latter has been very popular particularly during the 
 two weeks of heavy rains and cold evenings housey housey is occupying its usual place in the sun as premier 
 attraction of lie floor show musketry got under way promptly the next morning some lazy bod loving people claim it 
 was too promtly and the results this year are gratifyingly well above last year s record the weather man started 
 off tho month of june in the best of spirits arid camp life was a pleasure until 
 about the fifteenth of the month then for some reason beyond our ken the powers that be ruling the skies 
 turned against us and for the remainder of our stay at heals we had almost continuous rain how eberybody knows 
 what happens when it rains in camp 5 we just carry on as though nothing had happened i sure but 
 we don t like it and it doesn t make the small task of hitting the elusive bull any easier 
 it is hard enough at the best of times and undoubtedly the very vile weather experienced just as we came 
 to classification 0:classifica 0:tion day was all that prevented us from making 139 at least company shot for 1937 is

 humourous moments on 0 wing a new innovation at s rcoo there was never a dull moment aside from never 
 being quite sure when you wore going to pave to reach frantically for your respirator for dear life tho effects

 found themselves attacking the seme place and gave a fine demonstration 0:demonstrat 0:ion of bush warfare in arriving safe and

 to offer them a drink and that at 0600 hrsl on another operation an all night out post about half 
 our troops were most obligingly provided with hot shaving water by a local farmer the fact that most of them 
 had already shaved at a cold spring did not lesson the kindness of the gesture our commanding officer holidaying a

 80 sports notes grantland bunclock ad lib before introducing the 1937 38 season your commentator would like to mention his 
 visit to sarc oe gamp while a guest of the branch school at the above mentioned it was my good 
 luck to soe m a company softßall team play in several gomes thoy have a wonderful team in all departments 
 but only one good battery their hitting power is second to none with tho second baseman a lou gerhig thoy 
 played several games against championship teams using the alberta rules and lost only one gome to the champions of alberta 
 7 to 3 which playing under strange rules was a very creditable performance nov to mention s b company we 
 wore unable to enter a softball 0:soft 0:ball team in tho island league but two of our company pte glendinning 
 and cpl teskey pitched for tho island league champions and runners up with rumours of combined training at sarcee for 
 the unit next year your commentator predicts some very keen and closely fought contests the opinion formed is that tho 
 pitching staff of b tj company if still intact will most likely silence the batting power of the slugging details 
 of a m company in the field a company appear to have the edge so much for my remarks we 
 will leave the rest until the unit meets next summer now for the 1937 38 season at work point our 
 rugby team appears favourite to win the barnard trophy with lots of young players and the enlistment of a vancouver 
 rep hooker wood the pack is as good as ever and our doubtful positions at present appear to be the 
 weakness at center three quarters but before the ond of tho season it is hoped to fill this position from 
 some of the speedy recruits now enlisted our greatest blow is the loss of cur coach sergt bob qpuinn who 
 loaves us for winnipeg i believe that tho unit there has an english rugby team if so our loss will 
 most certainly be their gain however ser gt smiling bill wharton has taken over the onerous job of handling some 
 twenty five eager rugby enthusiasts and we have every confidence in his ability to lead to team still further on 
 the road to fortune and championship of our soccer league at present little is known except that the garrison is 
 entering the saturday league little has been seen of the new faces and until they arc tried on the field 
 of battle few conclusions can bo formed tho garrison field day was held during the latter part of may and 
 our unit while up against good competition managed to retain tho aggregate cup great credit must be handed to cpl 
 llack who won three events and placed several others until the tug of war event our unit was tied with 
 the composite units and the winning of the tug of war turned the scale in our favour it is hoped 
 in the future to see many new faces in the track events to relieve cpl mack of the burden ho 
 had to c rry your commentator will be ablo to clarify the form charts of the various toons more concisely

 the afternoon of april 10th where we were met and welcomed by capt chas o neill d mus j who 
 had been selected as musical director of the composite band 3 soon as our baggage was cleared we were driven 
 to the citadel and shown our temporary quarters after a much appreciated meal and wash and clean up we were 
 free to do as we liked under the guidance of bandsmen c longman and t smith royals b2e regt erstwhile 
 members of tho i p cp i we were conducted around the citadel this is a very interesting old fortress 
 and from the ramparts we had a magnificent view of the stately st lawrence distant blue mountains and surrounding vicinity 
 0:vici 0:nity of quebec it was near here of course that the historic 0:his 0:toric battle of the plains of 
 abraham was fought later on we proceeded to the city of quebec and we were greatly intrigued with its narrow 
 cobbled streets and ancient houses of french architecture quebec is a city rich in historical interest and we paid a 
 visit to the actual house where general montcalm was drought back wounded following the defeat of his army by general 
 wolfe we were very tired and it was late by the time we returned to the citadel but wo had 
 spent a very pleasant evening 
 83 the following morning we were joined by the bandsmen of the royal canadian regiment from london ontario and after 
 they had been shown their quarters we repaired to the band room chambro fan fare and our first rehearsal began 
 altogether we spent ten days at quebec and in addition to band practices we spent many hours on the barrack 
 square and were taken on several route marches we also attended a funeral played at the officer s pless and 
 were present on the occasion of a general inspection of the r 22e regt on tho evening cf april 3

 april 28th we pulled out from wolfo s cove in a tender to the s s montcalm which had left 
 montreal with the main body of the canadian contingent on board that morning as we drew up alongside playing popular 
 band numbers a great welcome awaited us from troops who gathered on deck to watch our arrival among those lining 
 the ship s rails we recognized our old friend c q k s a mcechan who had left winnipeg several 
 days before us the days spent on boa rd were very pleasant bond rehearsals 0:re 0:hearsals were held every morning 
 and wo gave programmes of music in the afternoon the evenings however wore entirely our own and many a congenial 
 and carefree hour was spent swapping yarns and singing the old time war songs on the evening of ley 7th

 after on inspection by the gcnerol staff of the southern command end a speech of welcome by the mayor wo 
 entrained for pirbright camp arriving there about noon we spent two days here prior to proceeding to london for tho 
 coronation and were quite busily engaged rehearsing for tho ceremonies pirbright is the summer training and musketry camp for the 
 brigade of guards and during our brief stay there we had for cor neighbors tho scots guards and had the 
 opportunity of seeing them on parade very smart they looked very clean and wo could not help marvelling at the 
 clockwork precision of their drill movements however the general concenus of opinion was that wo much preferred being in the 
 canadian army to the guards the guardsman s pay commences at about 48 cents per diem on the morning of 
 play 10th we proceeded by train to london and were marched to tho olympia building here we were quartered until 
 tho 12th and although the accomodation was poor having to sloop on the floor the food was excellent being catered 
 by lyons altogether there must have been well over five thousand troops staying there australians hew zoalandors rhodesians africans the 
 mountios and besides ourselves representatives of the regular army 
 84 pay 12th coronation day came at last and we left olympia about nine in tho morning and marched all 
 the way to the vicinity of buckingham palace where we joined the main body of the procession and what a 
 sight it must have been to the spectator a seemingly endless procession of marching troops drums beating and bands playing 
 along the route thousands of si htsoers were shouting themselves hoarse one could not help feeling a little proud as 
 he marched along to the accompaniment of such an outburst of loyalty to tho british empire at buckingham palace we 
 halted until the abbey ceremonies 0:cere 0:monies were over then proceeded to constitution hill where another halt was made until 
 the royal family entered the royal coach then the actual procession commenced around trafalgar spuarc past canada house piccadilly circus 
 along regent street along the thames embankment where the king had kindly arranged for thousands of london school children to 
 be accomdated all around london we marched the weather kept fine until th 3 late afternoon when it commenced to 
 rain and what a downpouri ge got soaked however we stuck it cheerfully enough although a great many brilliant uniforms 
 were completely ruined the long march ended at knightsbridge barracks where a bedraggled but not down hearted canadian contingent climbed 
 into motor busses wliich conveyed them back t o olympia it had been a thrilling 0:thril 0:ling day a day 
 to remember and each one of us felt very gproud to have been chosen for the occasion the following morning 
 we entrained back to pirbright camp arriving there about noon a little rest and time to get cleaned up again 
 and we wore back in london on may 14th to get our coronation medals from wellington barracks the irish guards 
 band played us to the palace whilst a great crowd turned out to watch us go by we marched through

 yarn comes from jim christie who was over gram salt spring island for our annual memorial chuch parade some little 
 while ago in tli 3 latter part of july and early ugu3t 1915 tho regiment occupied a very quiet sector

 in the line continually 0:contin 0:ually for nearly a month with the exception of an occasional reconnaissance night patrol and 
 tho usual dawn or dusk shoot the sport was a bit tame and rather monotonous half a mile or so 
 behind the line a rather nice farm had for some reason been left intact by tho enemy in fact the 
 owner was suspected of being a german spy i had noticed when passing the farm a very nice garden and 
 field of potatoes 0:pota 0:toes green peas nd other vegetables while our rations were always as good as could be 
 expected it struck mo that a batch of fresh vegetables would make a welcome reinforcement 0:reinforce 0:ment to our usual 
 mulligan accord w v two of us armed with sandbags struck out one forenoo i to do a little harvesting 
 on turning an acute bend in the read behind an old distillery we came face to face ith our erlg 
 dior goneral and staff we saluted the party smartly the general who had often spofcen to me before wanted to 
 know where we were going it was then that the suspected spy story came in useful i for one was 
 very thankful when the general s order was to carry on the good work corporal and also not to bo 
 asked hat the sandbags were for my experience with senior british officers has been that they use very good judgement 
 when asking for information probably being a bit of a rogue themselves hi any case the vegetable raid was successful 
 and appreciated by the sniping section
