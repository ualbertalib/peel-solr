 where a vast army of stenographers live full to day young women are found everywhere in busidays 3 to the
 historian the series offers more ness usually wnting letters on the type writer but often acting as confidential secretaries and
 as such than just a simple autobiography politicians receiving comfortable salaries 5 businessmen and social leaders tended to leave a

 their emerging role in the that the idea had become so widespread that it disbusiness world at the turn of

 average woman and tends to the develop i cannot remember when the idea of becomment of practical business qualities however

 perhaps it was born of the united states the average girls in toronto the really hideous life i had led

 would be sorry for anyone law firms and insurance offices pay the best who would have to read the details
 of those sa laries noted the rert 8 wearisome uninter esting year s but perhaps i a good stenographer had
 to take shorthand be lived them for a purpose for they have since served able to spell have a good
 knowledge of english to show me how vividly interesting life became and have some familiarity with the technical terms after
 they were over of commercial houses insur ance companies at five i started to public school and until i was
 banks etc many fail said the report be 16 i walked the straight and narrow path that leads cause they
 do not endeavour to acquire business to a teacher s certificate then i took the hems knowledge thinking that to
 be able to write so out of my skirts and the bows from my hair and many words per minute
 in shorthand and tran hied me to the backwoods to teach a country scribe the same on the typewriter is
 all that is school in the rooney settlement i feel so sorry necessar y but they are mistaken 9 for
 myself when i look back on the first years i in calgary the opportunities for stenographic taught that school gomorrah
 saskatchewan was work expanded with the population in 1902 only a r egion of hills and stump fences and primitive
 eight women were employed as stenographers but people a place where the men put cement floors by 1911 the numbers
 had increased to 442 at the in their pig pens but did not have the thoughtfultime when the series of
 articles appeared more ness to buy a carpet so that their wives might not than 750 women in calgary were
 listed as steno have to scrub the dining room floor graphers or typists i think it must have been the
 rain that planted the author of the series is unknown when one the idea in my mind or perhaps it
 had been there reads the account particularly the less than and the rain sprouted it as rain has a habit
 of doing flattering descriptions of some of her co workers with other things besides ideas it had been such anonymity
 is understandable even then the pouring for three days i was nearly frantic with names of persons and places in
 the article obvi listening to the tap of the drops on the window ously have been changed to protect the
 innocent pane i had read the few trashy novels that the the guilty or the stenographer herself one can house
 contained and played on the organ and my glean from her account that she was born on a resources were
 at the limit my instrumental perfarm possibly in saskatchewan taught school formances never lasted long for my repertoire was then
 gave it up to go to business college after scant there is a tavern in the town and receiving her
 certificate she arrived in calgary tenting on the old camp ground that was sometime in 1913 she was then in
 her early tweri about the size of it ties and described herself as a clear eyed girl the men sat
 in the kitchen and played checkers with a white freckiy skin and two braids of straight and smoked the smell
 of their damp clothing was brown hair around my head she was pain not particularly sweet and occasionally they spit
 fully shy prone to tears and extremely insecure on the floor finally toward the evening of the but also quite
 intelligent and quick to learn third day one of them stretching his arms about the account which follows is an
 abridged ver his head voiced my thoughts exactly i have got sion of her autobiography the log of a cal
 to do something or go mad gary stenographer only minor editing was picking up a kettle of hot water which
 had been the office of calgary brewing in 1913 shows a predominance of male staff put on the stove for
 the tired mrs greig to mop nation that night and handed it to my head trustee the floor after the
 men s afternoon idleness he with the inane beginning here is a billet doux tramped heavily out of the house
 toward the barn for you i watched him with my eyes but my brain must he was stupified for a
 moment for i was as have been a blank for i was not surprised when much a part of gomorrah
 as was the schoolhouse i saw him chase and catch a little pig about eight have you got another school
 ma am he weeks old and kill it i saw it all from the window enquired where i sat the
 scalding scr aping and cleaning i am going to business college i announced the other men went on with their
 games and i proudly still stared at the operation in the barnyard and he looked still more stupified said nothing
 maybe you would like to stay until christmas in about an hour the kitchen door opened and my boy levi
 be learning quite a bit in walked mr greig wit h the pig in his arms pink no i shouted
 i shall do well if i stay until and smooth and now dead i do now know what the first
 of july i shall go crazy if i stay in this was the cause the look on the men faces
 the hades any longer astonishment of mrs greig or the utter i stuck to my post until the last day
 and then ridiculousness of the situation but something with nine hundred dollars in the bank a few snapped in my
 head or my heart and i rushed to pounds of circulars from the mortimer business my room and laughed and
 cried until i was ex college under my arm and a great desire for hausted and the strain that ran
 under the laugh knowledge in my rebellious mind i shook the ter and the weeping was i must go away
 i can mud of gomorrah from my rubbers for it was not stand it any longer it was reiterated persis
 still raining tently as if someone were trying to argue with me i shall never forget my first day at
 the college not to go only the knowledge that my funds wer e sufficient it was the last of may
 so i wrote out my resig and the reflection that an ugly duckling once became a swan kept me from
 terminating my he fact that the shorthand teacher had told me that business career before it had begun and creep
 back i would have no difficulty in getting my diploma to gomorrah behind the hedges and stump fences and in
 keeping a position after i did get it for my that i so despised foundation was good meaning i supposed
 that the girls at mortimer were pretty and petite i knew how to spell and punctuate and might do their
 hair was wound in cunning little knobs over a little arithmetic if the occasion required their ears their skirts were
 short and narrowed that summer passed very quietly and peacedaintily there were fluffy ruffles around their fully i made a
 few girl friends but not so much necks and wrists and they were altogether so as a speaking acquaintance among
 the boys an different from poor little countrified me that the unconquerable fit of shyness had swooped down tears came
 into my eyes in spite of all my efforts upon me and i would go scarlet if one so much
 the girls were about the same age as i was some as looked at me sometimes i wondered how i
 were older but they looked and acted as if they was going to tackle the men i would meet in
 a were cared for and caressed instead of having business life in a city but he thought did not stay
 taught school for five year s and buffetted with long for i was not one to meet my troubles i
 was irascible parents and surly trustees always too much occupied with the ones that were i sat at my desk
 in the corner and took my staring me in the eyes to have time to look beyond bearings all the
 rest in the room seemed to be them to the procession that was waiting to move acquainted with each other
 girls and boys and up in the confusion and irregularity which always on the very last day of september i
 gr aduated attends first days of terms they laughed and joked i had a diploma two feet by three sever
 al cards and seemed to be so happy that i felt doubly mis setting out my accomplishments and abilities an
 erable but there kept running in my head the immense ambition and a fund of energy that has words of
 a letter i had received from the mother since astounded me of two boys with whom i had struggled for
 three yet after all i had something else i had a years without teaching them so much as that two
 broader view of things i knew how to dress and and two are four i have the letter yet in
 my holy my table manner s had returned at the greig s of holies a funny place to keep it
 yet it serves i had eaten with my knife at the risk of cutting to remind me that troubles are
 all trifles and that my throat i had grown used to pouring my tea time smooths out all the rough
 places in his rough into the saucer to cool it and used a toothpick with journey the dexterity of a
 sword swallower but gradually the mother of the boys in question had been my old time refinement had come back
 to me i born in kingston penitentiary and there was a story was a quiet confident clear eyed girl with
 a white around the rooney settlement that the grandfather freckly skin and two br aids of str aight br own
 hair had his particular nail in the building on which around my head such was my equipment for my to
 hang his hat and if he found any other man s life as i set out from saskatchewan for the
 offices hat on his nail when he went back which he fre and business men of calgary quently did he
 promptly knocked it off and hung my introduction to the joys and sorrows of a his own on its accustomed
 peg so no wonder i stenographer s life was through the medium of an could not teach johnnie and herbie
 anything and insurance office the manager is not in calgar y no wonder i r eceived saucy letters from their
 now which is a very good thing for calgary it mother which used to cause me sleepless nights seems to
 me and anxious days but i really think the memory i was sent up to the office early on a
 monday of those letters saved the situation for me for as morning by the remington typewriter company i sat there
 with the words of them running through and as a i hunted up the place i decided it was my
 mind i felt so thankful that the old times were the most wonderful institution in the world here dead that
 i would not have cared if i had been was i a green country girl not a week in calwearing
 hoop skirts and had been bald headed gary and without a friend and yet i had a posi the day
 passed as all days ar e bound to do and tion all picked out for me and by night i
 would the only pleasant thing i could pick out of it was have earned some money just because i had
 gone to a little concern down in the herald block and would have sat down to my typewriter just a
 speck had stated my case happier the office was not ha rd to locate for i had been it was
 a busy season for the office for hail well directed and in a few minutes the manager insurance premiums were
 being adjusted so that was looking me over at the same time i was there were eleven of us side
 by side down the taking a few glances at him and this is what i length of the room i
 did not pay much attention saw a big stupid looking man with a huge face to them the first morning
 for i was occupied with that looked as if he had slept in a mustard plaster filling in the forms
 that had been given me and i think i would not have minded the red lumpy did not look up
 from my machine contenance if his stomach had not been so fat but in the afternoon the fun began as
 i was since that time i have known and liked fat men taking my place after lunch mr slogan came
 into in fact i think i prefer them to the thin ones but the room he was in the same
 dishabille for the at the moment mr slogan s bulk seemed to be day seemed to have grown hotter and
 an immense especially objectionable cigar adorned his mouth now if there is one thing it was extremely hot weather just
 a farewell i like it is to see a man smoke a cigar and to be shot at us before
 winter came in earnest mr near enough to smell the smoke but the cigar in slogan had no collar on
 nor tie and his shirt was the mouth of that monstrosity gave me no pleasur e turned in at the
 neck for greater coolness i he stopped to fix a ribbon on one of the machines reasoned with myself while
 i was being approved and as he did so the door opened and in came that it was not my
 place to criticise my employer s a girl who had not been there in the morning i appearance i was
 there to do his work and i thought she was a new one who had just arrived would not have
 to look at him but i could not she was very tall and slight and wore her skirts help feeling
 that if he had been tidy and clean i well above her boot tops mr slogan caught sight i his
 is how downtown calgary looked to the alithor about 1913 it is a view lookinit north east from first street
 west of her and this was his gr eeting hello dollie her it looked to be the pr ettiest dress
 i had ever late again if i had legs as long as yours i would seen she was not tall
 but so pr ettily shaped that go and shoot myself she seemed to be above the average height she had
 i been dollie i would have been crushed handled her typewriter as if she hated it and i absolutely extinguished
 but not in the least dis really think she hated all the rest of the girls and concerted she hung
 her hat on a peg and answered mr slogan especially for her expression and the quite nonchalantly oh go and
 tell that to your way she had of holding her head was indicative wife my horror cannot be imagined i
 had heard of loathing whenever she happened to look at him and read of how a business girl should deport
 her as she was coming back from the desk where self but this was beyond anything i had ever we
 were handed our work when we were finished dreamed of what we had she leaned out of the window a
 but i found that the excitement had only begun moment to get a breath of dusty calgar y air as
 sitting beside me was a pretty girl who had been bad luck would have it mr slogan was in the
 there i learned for about four weeks and knew room at the time somewhere or other perhaps the ways of
 the place better than i did mr slogan on a postcard i have seen a picture which is supseemed to
 be in a genial mood that afternoon and posed to be funny and is entitled oh for a pr esently
 he sauntered over to my pretty neigh shingle evidently mr slogan had seen the piebor and began miss blake did
 you ever hear ture too at any rate he did not wait to sigh for the story of the little
 boy and the dimple it a shingle but snatched a ruler from one of the sounded innocent enough for what
 are more inno desks and playfully applied it to the pretty dignicent than little boys and dimples miss blake un
 fled girl i held my breath with horror and anger suspectingly answered that she had not heard the as she
 turned quickly and faced mr slogan her stor y so he proceeded to tell her though loud little brown face
 was quite white but she did not enough for several of the girls to hear when he speak she stared
 at him for fully a minute had finished there was a hideous silence i looked standing straight and still while
 he was chuckling straight ahead of me and my ears were crimson in a rather embarrassed way then she quietly
 with having to listen to such a tale mr slogan took her hat from the wall just as quietly put
 it swaggered from the room laughing loudly i on and walked out of the room that was the last leaned
 over and patted miss blake s hand and time i ever saw her and i am sure that she would
 received an answering pat that helped us both out take care that she would never meet mr slogan for the
 rest of the afternoon again i stayed until 7 o clock that night helping to that night i did some
 more thinking still lying check up the work the rest of the evening i spent on my back to tr
 y to ease the irritating ache that flat on my back on my bed trying to think but had got
 into it when i at last fell asleep i had my mind was in a frightful jumble of thoughts decided
 two things one was that i would spend part of the time i was back in gomorrah and part one
 more day in mr slogan s company and the of it i was in mr slogan s office but wherever
 other was that as a business girl i was a failure i was i was a miserable girl and might
 better go back to my school house but the next day found me back at my post where at least
 my tender sensitivities were safe if possible it was hotter than the day before and from offence my first experience
 had been such my back ached with the unaccustomed work i a shock to me that i was afraid to
 try any more filled out forms until i was dizzy and still more but when morning came my cheerfulness had
 forms were handed to me but i was not so shy returned as it always does in the morning so
 i as the day before and began to take more notice changed my mind about going back to teaching of
 the other girls i immediately noticed one of but not so about leaving that insurance office them although i did
 not know her name and had that evening i informed mr slogan that i was no chance to speak to
 her for she sat in a far not coming back he blustered and fumed and corner and did not speak
 to anybody she had grumbled that it was hard luck on a fellow to get brown hair and brown eyes
 and brown skin and a new girl into the office and just when he had a shabby brown dress to
 match them all but on got her taught how to do the work then up and left edmonton have i
 not earned my money i demanded so when it was proposed to me that i should how long did you
 spend teaching me to fill out join two girls for a sunday afternoon at bowness those forms i was nearly
 wild with delight that saturday night he seized a cheque book and wrote me a cheque my dreams were a
 series of picnics all of which for something over four dollars i could hardly either ended disastrously or had no
 ending at all bear to thank him but there was no use for my i spent sunday morning restlessly walking
 about being a pig just because he was one so i corn the house wishing for the afternoon and at
 two pelled myself to take the cheque politely and i also o clock i was on my way to the
 place of meeting wa lked out of the office never to return with a box of sandwiches tucked under my
 arm my chin was just a trifle higher and my shoul and as happy a heart as i had possessed
 since my ders the least bit broader as i strolled down first arrival in calgary street west that night and
 anyone looking at my at the corner i found two boys and two girls expressionless countenance would never have i
 knew the girls because they had invited me to guessed the eruption that was in progress behind the picnic but
 i had to be introduced to the boys it but by the time i had reached my room i was
 one of them took the introduction in a very bored laughing the funny side of those three days had manner
 the other was tolerably polite but not at hit me and hit me hard i could not have helped a
 ll interested it i have an irish mother at bowness we found a cool spot beside the it has been
 written that the canker of the city river and deposited our bundles one of the girls is loneliness and certain
 it is that my first six had brought a book and she suggested that she months in calgar y proved
 the correctness of that should read to us until we got hungry the two idea as i moved on to
 my next position as girls sat down with their backs against a couple stenogapher in a law office i had
 my work during of trees and the boys flung themsieves on the he day and was happy but the moment
 i entered ground and placed their he tds on the girls laps my room at night such a desolate feeling
 hit me it seemed quite a natural proceeding and i disin the face that i would turn straight around go
 guised my astonishment as well as i could back to the office and work until ten or eleven i camped
 at a little distance and watched o clock merely to get away from he awful sense developments i can see
 that book yet it was of aloofness in those days i found that work is saracinesca by marion crawford and
 it the best and most entertaining companion that one seemed a lot of rubbish to me because the girl can
 have provided that the work is sufficiently began to read just where she had left off at some hard and
 at the same time interesting other time the others seemed to understand the such an experience was not mine alone
 i hap plot and the thought came to me that this picnic pen to know that it has been borne
 by numerous was just one of a number when the same book other stenogaphers in this wonderful horrible had been
 read and the same head holding indulged city for me some of the worst times i had were in i
 wondered then why they had asked me to spent in front of fmndlay while waiting for a car come along
 as a serpent in their eden and could at six o clock such crowds of people and not arrive at
 no other explanation except that they one to whom i could speak nor one who could knew i was lonely
 and felt sony for me still i speak to me i have stood on a saskatchewan could not see wherein
 my loneliness was being prairie absolutely alone except for three elevator mitigated in the slightest degree tops on the horizon
 and a few gophers trotting i did my best to become interested but my mind about and have felt less
 friendless and deserted would wander as i watched the quartette i could than i used to feel as i waited
 at centre street for not help thinking that the girls had the worst of a blue car i remember the
 first time that some it they sat bolt upright against a hard tee which one spoke to me on the
 street i walked on air was tiring in itself while the boys were lying for the rest of the day
 and during the half hour down with a soft pillow for their heads then i immediately succeeding he event i
 was so excited wondered if the youths knew the meaning of the that i was not sure whether i was
 in calgar y or word shampoo certainly their hair did not look ‘ d ‘ d major calgary businesses maintained
 a large staff of stenographers and typists this is the stenographic poo 1 for the cpr land department in 1915
 it and one of them showed no sign of having on the bank and when one of the women came
 even a speaking acquaintance with a razor to dip a can in the water she nearly stepped on the reading
 went on if i had ever had any con me and noticing my briny countenance inquired nection with the story
 i would have lost it by this the trouble i truthfully explained that i was time so presently i got
 up without any interrup fighting an attack of homesickness tions ‘ or inqui ry from the others and rambled never
 shall i forget those people in five through the bushes up the river i followed the minutes i had dried
 my tears had been introduced path for a short distance and then sat down on to the whole pleasant party
 and was eating potaa ledge with my feet at the edge of the water and to salad and drinking lemonade
 just as if i had watched dead gophers float down the river known them all my life i had completely
 forgot i smiled hard ver y hard to keep my face from ten my literary friends down the river when
 i wrinkling in a more undignified way but at last did recollect them it spoiled my appetite for a i
 had to acknowledge that the tears were trickling moment but i promptly forgot them and the fun down my cheeks
 i could not delude myself with went on after lunch was over we found a tiny the excuse that i
 was crying over the sad fate of owl and in the interest which it created i still furthe gophers and
 was forced to confess that i was ther forgot my troubles until i heard a shout which sniffling not because
 i did not have a head to told me that i was being sought i said goodbye hold but because
 i knew that i would not have to the good samaritans who had rescued me from held one if it
 had been provided and i did so myself and went to meet my companions i said long to be like
 other girls and find pleasure in nothing about where i had been beyond mentionsitting in an uncomfortable position and nursing
 ing the owl and they accepted the explanation a boy s untidy ungroomed head i felt as if i i
 think they would not have cared if i had found would never have another day s happiness unless a roaring
 lion so long as i had not disturbed their my disposition changed in that direction spooning another picnic party had
 in the meantime so i ate a second lunch with them joined in without my observing it located just above
 me the conversation as well as i could and said how much i was enjoying the afternoon it was a
 fact eyes which gave him the aspect of a fly bitten i was enjoying it for those stange people had
 horse his suit was a tragedy a greenish gray revived my liking for humanity which had color polka dotted with
 something that looked received a severe check during the half hour i had suspiciously like gravy his only prepossessing listened
 to the reading of saracinesca feature was his hands and they were exquisitely it was late when we got back
 to town and i long and white and delicately shaped during the parted from the happy four with no regrets
 that course of his brief friendship with me he never night was the only time i can remember when i
 reached the hand holding stage which most men was glad to get back to my room i usually hated attain
 but if he had i am sur e no piece of satin it so violently i sat by the window
 thinking over would have been softer or smoother than the skin he events of the day i would not have
 parted with which covered his splendid digits the memory of it for anything those dear good he did not believe
 in work but had a theory people had said such funny silly things to make that the world owed him
 a living he put this me laugh they had talked to me of ontario theory into practice on every possible
 occasion though they had come from england they had for an hour at a time he would sit with his
 feet discussed homesickness until i felt as if it were on his desk his chair tilted back a cigarette in
 a pleasure and a privilege and also a joke they his mouth and his eyes shut dreaming his had invited
 me to go and see them socia listic dreams a nd i used to wonder if the time what wonderful
 results thought i can were far distance when he would be given a bit develop from what poor beginnings even
 such of sound advice and escorted to the door a very unpromising beginning as a head holding in the meantime
 he was good to me and helped picnic to make my first struggles in calgar y a trifle a few
 weeks later i was reminded of an un pleasanter one day he was seized with a bright biblica l beatitude
 which goes something like this idea which he confided to me and which was as blessed is the man who
 attendeth strictly to his follows he knew of a place down in east calbusiness for he shall stand before kings
 but the gary where fine mushrooms grew and he was quite chances are that the other fellow will be sitting
 willing to go down and gather them if i would with the queens whenever i think of that little cook
 them and we would have a tea party bit of nonsense i think of mr stoop and ever i had
 been having a very dull time and anything the thought of mr stoop verifies its truth was welcome as a
 diversion so i stated the case he was the first young man of my acquaintance to mrs white the quiet
 little widow with whom in calgar y and i was still at that stage of lone i was then boarding
 and she fell in with the idea someness and homesickness when even a friendly at once she and her daughter
 wee going out to rhinoceros would have looked good to me as we tea on saturday and i might have
 the use of the were in the same office and i took his work i had stove and the pretty
 little dining room where we a splendid chance of observing him and the result three ate our meals together of
 my observations was that i decided that he was i was highly excited and secured two cookbooks he most attractive
 unattractive man that i had ever which gave information on the subject of seen i have yet to figure out
 what the attraction mushrooms i learned that they were generally was eaten along with beefsteak and that the gravy was
 he was ver y tall and of such a build that one thickened with flour i reflected that mr stoop
 expected that he might at any moment break off had said nothing about who would buy the steak at the
 knees his face was extremely thin his chin or supply the flour and that it would not be much receded
 and his teeth would have given a sensi of a tea party without something beside mushtive dentist heart failure his
 eyes were large and rooms but i was so glad to have a little bit of melancholy and hollow the
 result of too little fun that i would have supplied the rest of the sleep and too much midnight poker
 he wore his supper if it had taken my last cent life gets hair long quite to his collar in
 the back and to monotonous when it is spent everlastingly with the end of his nose in front he was
 continually a widow and an old maid flinging back his head to get his bangs out of his i bought
 a cake some bananas and a little paper pail of rochon s cream then i set the table very without
 making a sound and the weary droop of charmingly for two put some chairs on the ver his shoulders called
 forth from me bushels of a ndah and sat down to await the mushrooms they sympathy but i did not
 express it and crept out took a long time in coming i was beginning to of the office leaving him
 there alone get rather restless and the sun was grinning at me when he was handed the cheque for 25
 that as it slipped down into the west before i spied mr day he had 6 00 in his pocket
 that made 31 stoop sauntering up the street he looked utterly if my addition is correct that night he played
 a exhausted and came along as if each step were slot machine and lost every cent and woke up on
 his last his hands were in his pockets and i won sunday morning without a position or a dollar dered
 where the mushrooms were he managed shortly after that he left calgary on some to climb up the steps collapsed
 into the chair and money supplied by one of his sisters i did not explained that it was so late
 when he finally got blame him for going but i was afraid that wherever time to go after the mushrooms
 that he thought he went he would still be on the rocks he came it best to come along without
 them rather than to to see me the night before he went away i asked keep me waiting i did
 not know whether i looked him what he was going to do he answered that as heathenish as i felt
 but i kept my temper sweet he was finding out his calling in life by the process and kindly offered
 to lead him to the bathroom of elimination during his twenty five years he he looked as if he needed
 to be soaking for a week had tried and found that he was not suited to in chloride of lime
 mining school teaching or law but he had hopes so we had the beefsteak without the entre and that some
 day he would strike the occupation that i comforted myself with the thought that even if he was meant for
 i had hopes along he same line he had got the mushrooms they might have been but i also had
 fears and the fears were such that toadstools and perhaps i was having a lucky they put the hopes in
 the shade but i will never escape from being poisoned have a chance of finding out if my anxiety was
 after he had been pretty well filled and there justified for since the night he told me goodbye was not
 a scrap of anything left on the table we i have had no tidings from him sat in mrs white
 s little den by the light of the so passed away mr stoop from calgar y and fire and mr
 stoop quoted to me snatches of on looking back at the short time during which robert service and omar khayam
 his voice was he favored me with his acquaintance i cannot entracing it was like a friend s caress i
 leaned discover any benefit which either of us derived into it and loved it and forgot that he was a
 shift from the same i am wondering if he is still less law student with a creasy greasy suit of
 eliminating his options clothes and a faculty for forgetting his promises if i were to accurately describe this office in
 when he finally said goodnight without a word which i am now working people might say of thanks for the
 trouble i had taken or a look of that girl has made a big mistake she is attemptappreciation for the
 good meal he had eaten i felt ing to give us an idea of a cozy corner in heaven as
 if he had conferred a great favor on me by instead of a business office in calgar y where of
 coming the spell of the poetry and the melody all places men are out after money and are not of
 his voice gave me the blues for the next day accustomed to let even consideration for their so i really
 think he got more out of his tea party stenographer stand in the way of their search than i did
 but it would be the people who would be but the end was drawing near he came down making the
 mistake and by the time i am through to the office any time that he happened to take with my
 yam i am afraid there will be a mad rush the notion and the mistakes he made were stupen of
 stenographers for my position only they will dous so one saturday morning he was summoned not know in which direction
 to rush to headquarters given a cheque for 25 told that i shall call my firm messrs good better he
 need not appear on monday morning and left best bamsters solicitors notaries etc calto think things over gary alberta having
 got that far i am at a loss i believe he actually did some serious thinking which member to describe
 as which because they that morning he stood at the window a long time are all so much of a
 muchness that i do not know the office staff was nestled in with floor samples at metals ltd headquarters in
 calgary about 1915 which is really the best i think perhaps the one dark which all goes to prove that
 i have the best i work for would be mr best for he is the best employer in the city
 and appreciate my blessings one to me mr better is beautifully plump and marches in he makes me work hard
 but it is much the and out of the office like a grenadier even we same with stenographers as it
 was with david frivolous stenographers recognize the fact that he harum s dog and the fleas namely a reasona is
 unusually clever and we respect him accordble amount of work is good for a stenographer ingly and are rather ill
 at ease in his presence it keeps her from brooding on being a occasionally he condescends to joke with us
 and stenographer but i do not mind the hard work we laugh as heartily as our embarrassment will for once
 in a long while mr best smiles at me allow for instance he often anxiously inquires and at such times
 i go up into the seventh heaven if he looks as bad as he feels when we tell him it
 is a good thing for me that one smile effects that a lady client is waiting to see him he
 wants such a miracle for the ones i get are few and far to know if she is pretty sometimes
 he offers us between but when i get one i know that i have a cigarette which we politely refuse
 if he hapearned it and it warms the compartments of my pens to miss a day at the office we
 feel as if someheart like a friendly hot water bottle body had died and if he should go away forever
 my conversation with mr best is strictly in the our hearts would smash into a thousand pieces business line we
 rarely touch on personal mat to mr good we take all our troubles he is ters but when he rings
 my bell i catch up my book a regular electric iron for smoothing out the and hustle in for my
 dictation with as much creases in our office lives if we have a headache alacrity as if i were going
 to a dance if he should and think we would like to go home in the midask me to work
 all day sunday i would eliminate dle of the afternoon and take a fresh start the next sunday school and
 risk my eternal happiness and morning mr good paves the way for our deparcheerfully pound my typewriter from daylight till
 ture if we have indulged too freely in pretty col lars and ice cream and find ourselves stony broke with
 a visit looks over my shoulder and ventures with payday in the dim distance it is mr good to suppose
 that i have enough work to keep me who approaches the bookkeeper and secures our busy until six o clock
 i of course have cheques ahead of time if we have made a serious by this time my right hand
 neighbor s nerves mistake in our work and are afraid to confess to have played out entirely and she gives
 him a cold headquartes mr good is the intercessor and stony glare and tells him to hurry up and dictate
 saves us many a reprimand what he has to say before she goes crazy the but oh our law students
 how shall i describe relief of the other two rascals is evidenced by their them even with a dictionary on
 my knee old grateful glances at the victim nuttal did not know our law students else he usually after a
 scene like this he goes out and would have hunted up more expressive adjectives buys up some chocolates at such
 times we are to help me to do he justice so filled with remorse that we almost have no our
 third year student is a good young man room left for the peace offering we make splen he goes to
 church sunday and passes round the did resolves which are forgotten as soon as the contribution box but unlike the
 man in the song taste of the sweets disappear he is invariably he is just as good on weekdays and
 i am sure he good natur ed invariably courteous and if we would not steal the gold out of his
 grandmother s would pattern our manners and morals after his jaws or from any other place even if it sat
 up and it would make things easier for us all begged him to help himself we disrespectful girls the office
 life of a law stenographer is not have nicknamed him grandma to our in monotonous it is intensely vividly interesting
 finitesimal brains it seems a huge joke but we filled with the lights and shadows of other lives ought to
 be ashamed of ourseif because he is very one hears numerous hard luck stories some kind to us and has
 never failed to help us out of true many fabricated but if one does not know any difficulty or answer
 any question that we take which is which the sympathy is excited just the to him same sometimes we are
 called upon to settle our second year student is a mystery and a family rows but the facts of these
 are quite safe mystery is always interesting to a girl we are in our keeping for it has been impressed
 upon tr ying to decide whether or not he is a woman us garrulous girls that office secrets are not
 to be hater and have almost come to the conclusion that divulged he might be if he wee let alone
 but one thing as my lunch hour comes between one and two is certain he himself is not apt to
 be hated by the o clock and as i am frequently alone in the office women and only his iceberg
 attitude and zero between twelve and one i often get trapped into ma nner have saved him from being run
 away with listening to a tale of woe that some talkative client long ago the thing i like most about
 him is that simply must tell to someone at such times i am the men all like him and that
 is a sufficient guaran like the wedding guest who was held up by the tee that he is made of
 the right stuff ancient mariner and i stop struggling and listen our first year student is henpecked he has a
 with the outward appearance of a lamb though heart as big as a barn and we girls impose on him
 inwardly i am as r estless as a fish worm on a disgracefully if he wants some work done he
 re hook quests us very politely to do it whereas if he one drowsy noon i sat at my desk
 day dreamspoke in a loud voice and ordered us about such ing which habit of mine is disastrous for the
 firm is the contrariness of feminine nature that we but rather entertaining for myself i was brought would comply much
 more willingly he comes to my everyday senses as the door was timidly along with a number of files under
 his arm and pushed open and a woman sidled in she look in a meek supplicating voice inquiries if we
 are scared to death i stood up politely and tried to all busy no answer we all pound away as
 if our look at her reassuringly in order to convey to her lives depended just then in our speed he
 stands that she was not in any danger when she entered behind my left hand neighbor and jiggles first on
 our peaceful law office my glance was at the one foot and then on the other until she in desper
 same time questioning which was meant to daw ation tells him to move on then he favors me from her
 the nature of her business i have deve loped a wonderful brand of questioning expres nearly her whole history she
 cried at intervals sion it saves the fatigue of talking and i had difficulty in understanding her for she she
 whispered that she would like to see a cer talked in a rather broken english which however fain one of
 the firm but i had to tell her that he sounded pleasing when not punctuated by sobs was out a
 nd would not be back until thee o clock her name was mrs vineberg and she had three she sat
 down and stared helplessly at the ceiling children and lucy was such a clever child and and i stared at
 her could learn so well at school only she had to stay she was a very pathetic little creature with
 a at home and mind charlie and jakey while mrs lined wrinkled face i marvelled that any vineberg went out
 cleaning the house was falling woman s face would be so crossed and criss to pieces and she was afraid
 the children would crossed with wrinkles and yet beneath the net break their bones on the rickety steps or catch
 cold work i could find a trace of bygone prettiness because of the dampness of the surroundings she her eyes
 were blue and her hair very soft and did not make much money and most of what she brown though
 badly kept and straggling over her did earn went for fuel to warm the suburbs of calcoat collar her dress
 was a faded blue and she gary for the house had sprung in places and she wore black stockings with
 brown shoes in her could not keep the cracks stuffed well enough to hat was a dilapidated feather which i
 suppose keep out the cold was after all an attempt at style such as we all woman like she started
 at the end of the story attempt though in a different way and worked around to the beginning and after
 a i was wandering into a nother reverie on the pos desperately long time i became aware that there sibilities
 of my some day developing into a was a mr vineberg evidently he did not figure withered old woman when
 my visitor began to very largely in mrs vmneberg s scheme of things talk and she stopped only when she
 had told me except to be the cause of the whole trouble from u i i 51 i 4 soinetitiie

 in life was and i gathered that he was a kind husband and to drink beer at the neighboring bar
 but he always father that he was so consider ate to her that he took care to be hanging around
 at meal times and did his best to conquer his taste for liquor but it his appetite was prodigious the
 way mrs vine was a losing game that he died at peace with his ‘ berg berated her absent better
 half was not slow family and that mrs vineberg grief was and i was ashamed to find that my sympathies
 overwhelming were wavering between the two with the suspi i was genuinely sorry for her and disgusted cion of a
 balance in favor of the latter and yet with myself for remembering that she had been one or two things
 she said gave me a hint that so bitter against him on her first call i thought she still had
 a smouldering affection for the broken up all the comforting hings i could and said them stick to which she
 was tied to her and as before my sympathy seemed to when at last i got a chance to say
 a few words work wonders i brushed her poor black skirt from my inexperience with shiftless husbands i gave her
 a clean handkerchief and sent her on spoke and my words showed how very ver y in her way not
 exactly rejoicing but at any rate in experienced i was better spirits than she had been previous to her well
 mrs vineberg quoth i i am sony coming for you you certainly seem to be up against it then i
 fell into another daydream how was but you came to the right lawyer when you came it possible that a
 woman could give up her youth here we all know that a woman takes a huge her good looks her

 mrs foolish enough to get tangled up with a husband vineberg and notwithstanding the sacrifice and i would stand by

 without any growling and if he so me and find words of defence for the man who far forgot me
 as to spend his time in the bar of had caused the wreck i have heard a song that a
 hotel i would be the last one to tell his failing sets forth that love is half a rosebud and

 a girl to say to an old the singing she would change the proportion to married woman but it seemed
 to do her good one tenth and nine tenths and she brightened up considerably she shook i looked down at
 my little underwood which hands with me and said that she was glad she so faithfully helps me earn my

 little typewriter sympathy i was surprised to hear it but perhaps but because i am only a girl how can
 i help some i had looked the sympathy if i had not expressed day changing my mind it about our
 stenographes well we are just it was four weeks to a minute when mrs vine like any other bunch of
 girls in a large office berg again humbly walked into the office this some weeks we live together amiably other

 was the color of an eastern snow apple get disgusted with our lot and dream dreams of in december and
 her eyes were nearly swollen going to vancouver or some other far off field that shut my heart sank when
 i saw her coming for looks greener than the one close at hand when i knew not what disaster would
 be poured into all the men happen to be out of the office at the my unwilling ears same time
 we have hilarious doings among our i was not kept long in suspense this time the selves but when we
 feel one of them coming up lotus eating mr vineberg was dead he had the street we cool down very

 automobile trip to the peace river george w parkes is back in the city after an automobile trip from calgar
 y to peace river crossing a distance of 1 014 miles mr parkes says that he believes he is the
 first man who ever made a journey all the way from this city to the crossing exclusively by auto the
 trip couldn t be called exactly a bed of roses said mr parkes it was pretty fair sledding from calgar
 y to edmonton the going was a trifle thick and slushy but nevertheless the road was fairly fast in spots
 and the 200 mile stretch was negotiated without any very great difficulty but from edmonton to athabasca i seemed to
 make about as much progress as a squirrel on a treadmill and from there to grouard and peace river crossing
 i actually thought i was going backwards i ll never forget the difficulties of the trip going and coming from
 peace river crossing to athabasca the wheels of my machine sunk to the hubs in snow and slush in places
 and sometimes i could only travel about three miles an hour the roads were cut up by sleigh and wagon
 ruts i passed dozens of teams which were freighting into the peace and grande prairie districts the crossing is a
 typica l scene of frontier activity everybody is buying and everybody is optimistic i would not advise anyone without capital
 to go there however it costs a dollar to get a good meal and three and four times that for
 lodging men with small stores and supply houses are making money selling to trappers and homesteaders but there is very
 little acti ity of any other kind on the ground most of the property which has been sold at peace
 river crossing has been handled in edmonton it is being re handled with startling rapidity and the future is being
 generously discounted by purchasers who have faith in the growth of the town which many people are inclined to think
 will some day be a good sized city one thing is certain however it will be impossible for grouard and
 peace river crossing both to be big places they are only 89 miles apart grouard has a population of close
 to 2 500 now and many business houses and banks have been built there what is possibly the biggest single
 deal in town property in the north country was closed there a few days ago when a syndicate from newport
 news virginia paid 100 000 for a large block of chose in property the townsite of grouard is one of
 the prettiest i have seen it slopes gently to lesser slave lake on the northwest end of which it is
 located and commands a fine view of the surrounding country mr parkes made the trip in a six cylinder chalmers
 car he morning albertan calgary april 6 1914 peter erasmus by george h gooderham peter erasmus was one of that
 small group august 1859 leaving the blackfoot country to of mixed bloods whose names appear frequently return to his friends
 and relations in settlements on official documents and in reports pertaining to along the river route to fort garry he
 development of western canada when a mis peter refused to continue with the expedition sionary or representative of the crown
 had to meet through the mountains for unrelated reasons in with the indians erasmus often acted as guide his report
 capt palliser spoke well of him and and interpreter he played a much larger role in referred to him as
 doctor hector s man doctor shaping the history of the country than has been hector was palliser s first lieutenant
 and had credited to him trained peter in some surveying and apparently peter was born in 1833 of a danish
 father and valued his services by giving him extra an ojibway mixed blood mother in the red river responsibilities settlement
 of kildonan his father had fought at easmus came into prominence again in 1862 waterloo and later became a hudson

 travel west to extend chief factor w h cook and was three fourths the work started by steinhauer among the
 crees indian peter received his early education in the and stoneys the rev mr macdougall needed settlement school and then
 assisted his uncle the a guide a fur trader recommended peter and he rev henry budd a native anglican clergyman
 was accepted he joined the rev george and his in his work at la pas at age twenty he entered
 teenaged son john at fort carlton and remained st john s college winnipeg where he was a as guide and
 interpr eter for some time he guided fairly promising student it was hoped of course them to victoria edmonton and
 other western that he would qualify as a minister of the gospel indian settlements it is understood that the relain
 the anglican faith but he had no such inclina tionship with the macdougalls was a happy one tion instead he
 left to take a position as inter particularly between the two young men john a nd preter and guide to
 the rev thomas woolsey peter a wesleyan missionary woolsey was a brother erasmus remained in these parts and was marin
 law and the successor of the rev r t rundle ried to a native woman at victoria mission in who
 was the first non conformist missionary to 1864 he did some trading for the hudson bay travel across the prairies
 company and was so well and favourably known while at la pas erasmus came to know a by indians and
 metis that lt governor alexander native missionary the rev h b steinhauer an morris chose him as interpreter when negotiating
 eastern indian who had r eceived his education at tr eaty no 6 in 1876 when the crees and victoria

 treaty on the north saskatchewan called victoria and and later adhesions settled them the author was for many years indian
 agent ofl the steinhauer made this his future home but blackfoot reserve then became regional supervisor erasmus who was a
 restless soul joined the of indian agencies for alberta after his retirement palliser expedition as guide and interpreter in in
 1954 he joined the glenbow foundation and wrote this article four years later he died in calgary in 1977 1857
 he remained with the expedition until attitude of the government at ottawa and some of the representatives in the legislative
 assembly and even if men like erasmus did not support riel they were hurt by the manner that they were
 treated after the rebellion virtually all halfbreeds were treated as outcasts and were not permitted to hold their heads up
 with pride for their earlier accomplishments i am convinced that was ‘true with erasmus nevertheless he was a force in
 the settlements of cold lake and st paul de metis and it must be assumed that the liberal regimes that
 followed he conservative government of sir john a macdonald got the support of peter and his friends that would be
 consider able but even if it was not recognized in some tangible form at first it certainly was during the
 laurier regime when the sifton brothers and frank oliver were the powers in western canada in 1908 frank oliver proprietor
 of the edmonton bulletin and the sitting member fom that constituency was minister of interior in the laurier government i
 remember that he visited the blackfoot indian reser e that summer and made a speech to the indians from the
 platform of the indian office it was a real occasion for the indians but it developed that the honorable frank
 had more than the interests of the non voting peter erasmus treaty indians in mind he was thinking of a
 good friend among the voting half breeds peter eras following this meeting the name erasmus does mus shortly after the
 minister s visit peter not appear in print for years with his good arrived to fill a newly cr eated
 position that of education training in the palliser expedition and assistant rationer oliver had known the leading association with outstanding
 men and knowledge mixed bloods from the days when he freighted of the countr y and native tongues erasmus could
 across the prairies and wanted to help them peter have assumed responsible positions but apparently had not prosper ed and
 a little help was justified he had no such ambitions preferring the free and though this particular position had no
 meaning easy life of the hunter voyageur and part time there were others to do the rationing as an old
 employee of the hudson s bay company he did party healer once said peter was rewarded for operate a small
 company post at good fish lake faithful service with a government sit for a number of years with the arrival
 of new it was at the blackfoot thdian agency that i first settles the mode of life even by the
 indians met peter erasmus in 1909 he was then a man changed they became farmers and fresh business of 76
 but he did not look over 50 a big man centres sprang up the business of his little post weighing
 200 pounds he presented a distinct condwindled and it was closed out trast to the blackfoot and white man he
 wore politically there was representation on his a beard a straggly affair he was slightly bald but behalf in the
 north west council at regina and beard and head were black the prominent facial a lso in a rather vague
 way in the house of com feature was his nose to a stranger it was revoltmons and senate at ottawa
 such an intelligent ing a mass of pitted flesh that laid flat across his mixed blood as erasmus was bound
 to resent the brown face the sides were no longer connected with the cheeks and these lobes could be folded
 i think his best tall story was about his encounter back to expose the nostril bones he never with buffalo
 he was riding up the valley of the explained how he grew such a monstrosity bow at the foot of
 a cutbank when he heard a his demands were very simple he lived in a rumbling sound ahead he thought
 it was caused room over the office and the furnishings corn by a sudden gust of wind likely a chinook
 which prised a cook stove bed table and chairs with rushes out of the south west stirring up the leaves
 a few utensils and a lamp he wore only pants a nd branches of tees in the flat on emerging
 into and dark cotton shirts except when it was very a broad valley he found out he was wrong the
 cold then he donned an old black coat around flat was filled with buffalo stampeding towards his waist however was
 tied the traditional half him he was horrified what was he to do with breed sash peter had the spirit
 and dash of a a cutbank on one side and deep water on the other young man but kept mostly
 to himself when off as peter told it he paused at this point then duty he did not mix with
 the blackfoot though proceeded i was young and supple so i just sat he spoke their tongue very well the
 children of my horse until the head of the herd hit it then the indian agent were his real pals
 he was gentle i jumped on the back of the nearest bull and leaped and kind and told such wonderful
 tales from back to back until i came to the end of the during the day he kept himself busy
 as possi herd and landed on the ground again i didn t have ble with little choes and if nothing
 to do he a scr atch on me but of course i was afoot retired to his room and wrote
 folklore he burned peter s government sit at the blackfoot the night oil in writing tales told him by his
 grand agency ended with the defeat of the laurier mother a nd then one day he loa ned these to
 a lady government by the borden conservatives in 1911 visitor who claimed she wrote for a church paper he returned
 to the saddle lake country and set never to have his work returned tled in the cold lake district as

 the also very proud of his fitness and his prowess as drummers forgot neither the erudite nitchie nor a young
 man for example he claimed at one the warning time he could raise himself to a standing position peter was
 restless even in his eighties and he from kneeling on hands and knees with 800 was so furious at the
 lack of interest of the governpounds of shot piled on his back he would show ment in the welfare and
 education of the children with a gleam in his eyes a six inch scar across of mixed bloods that he
 started a school and was his stomach and wait for how did you get the teacher to get a school

 petition the blackfeet signed by the majority of the taxpayers the half peter erasmus posed with indian and white friends
 on the blackfoot reserve about 1910 breeds squatted in settlements and rarely paid nition of his services to the mixed

 were mormons the park wardens and buildings for refuge against severe storms were not happy with the influx of sheep
 they in spite of the weather setback between 1901 cropped the grass so short that it was no longer and
 1906 he numbers of sheep in western canada possible to prevent the effects of rain and snow increased from the

 richard c har exception rather than the rule at that time most vey a veter an sheep man established the
 first of the sheep men had flocks varying in size dipping vats and shearing plant at chin lakes 2 between
 500 and 5 000 sheep when sold the these new methods coupled with a more co knight flock enabled richard

 john chip nities he combined leadership in the church with man was assisted in his operations by his cousin leadership
 in the community he became a high ab chipman but this man soon returned to utah priest in 1924 and
 served for many year s on the and was r eplaced by john s only son reed that town council

 to go to quite different from those of john i chipman his american fork utah in the fall of 1908
 and to interests and activities precluded long absences enroll their daughters at brigham young univer from magrath and thus a

 had grow chipman joined other sheep men who were been disastrous for jesse knight who lost enorgetting together to offset
 the loss of range to set mous numbers of sheep and cattle he approached tlement and to obtain additional grazing
 land richard c harvey with a view to exchanging his john chipman took his place in this movement sheep for
 harvey s cattle a deal was struck for and became a member of the alberta wool the fall of 1903
 and harvey turned over most of growers association ‘ he was well known his cattle kept a few milk cows
 for himself and throughout the sheep country for he travelled received 2 000 sheep by 1907 his flocks of sheep
 regularly to and from warner by train until his had increased to a size where he required more death in
 1922 20 grazing land than was available in the stirling the school of agriculture at raymond maintained herds of sheep
 as part of its educational program the herd is seen grazing near the school in 1923 area so he purchased
 a piece of land on chin the dominion experimental farm at many coulee with more feed available he brought berries
 recognizing the ronmellet superiority for several flocks of sheep up from montana and alberta production for wool and mutton tried
 to fattened them for winter sale to burns co in carry on the br eed that harvey had established by
 calgary cross breeding romneys with rambouillets the richard c harvey early came to realize that experimental farm obtained new breeding
 stock the sheep flocks in alberta did not comprise the from each and started their breeding program but type of
 sheep best suited to the available range they were unable to achieve the high standards he therefore set about establishing
 a br eed of that harvey had established with his romnellets his own that would serve the dual pur poses
 of to distinguish their attempts from the original the wool and mutton with advice front successful experimental farm s sheep
 were called romnebreeders elsewhere he bought registered romney lets with only one ‘ 1 marsh rams from england and rambouillet
 ewes richard c harvey was a pioneer in ways other from the best flocks in montana and utah these than
 producing a new registered breed of sheep became the foundation for the romnellet note the he was the first to
 adopt the australian method double ‘ 11 breed he continued to perfect the of sheep shearing and sheep men came
 many breed and received encouragement from govern miles to have their sheep sheared at his chin lake ment departments and
 from the sale of his sheep corrals he developed a tail docking machine that to other breeders cauterized the wound
 and thus considerably he still had natural difficulties to face the reduced the losses from docking sores and infecsnows of
 the winter of 1919 prevented his 25 000 tions he was the moving spirit behind the necessheep from grazing and
 many of them perished sity for sheep men to group together and was in spite of superhuman attempts to bring
 feed to recognized by his fellow sheep rancher s by them the prices of mutton and wool continued becoming the
 first president of the southern to fall throughout the l 920 s with the result that alberta wool growers association
 he was unable to pay off the bank loan for the another large sheep rancher who came into his 1919
 winter feed in 1933 the bank disposed of own in the l 920 s and later was james b ririe
 most of his flocks leaving him about 1 500 head of magrath he had come to canada with his and
 the chin coulee property on which to run parents in 1899 from lehi utah 25 his father them this was
 very well adapted to sheep being james b rine was one of hose ca lled to settle open range for
 miles with a lake of water at hand in canada because the mormon church believed however by 1935 much of
 the neighbouring land it was best to send well to do people to new cornhad been taken overforfanning so harvey
 decided munities so that they would be able to help others to take his purebred sheep up into the okanagan
 who were not so well off he probably had the valley where he later sold them best equipment of any
 settler ririe chartered a train and brought in purebred brought their mother and their sister maggie with rambouillet and memo

 harker ranch was sold to clark ations increasing them until he was the largest lund and the harker family moved
 back into sheep rancher in canada at one time he bought magrath nephi worked as a stock buyer and later

 another large rancher renowned for the number shearing it was james a ririe who was later and solidity of his
 structures was john taylor responsible for bringing the austr alian corriedale heninger born in mount pleasant utah in 1875 and
 the columbia range sheep into canada 27 on hearing of the opportunities in alberta he nd another leader from magrath
 in the sheep his father chartered a railway car loaded it with ranching business was nephi harker son of levi

 way that james a ririe had walton who had come to visit her brother been called to canada as a
 man of position to andr ew living in raymond j t took on a shar e help he new settlers

 ewes their amazing success for himself in the sheep ranching business in 1915 production in lambs and wool launched him
 into nephi took over the ranch some twelve miles the sheep business for life each ewe had twins south of
 skiff and he and his family moved out and one had triplets there for ten years later when the children
 went after five good years j t bought the property to school they lived in town and would only come
 owned by horace welling and moved his family out to the sheep ranch during the summer to welling in 1908
 but within a year he was holidays forced by encroaching settlement to move his nephi had five sheep camps with
 10 000 head sheep to other grounds the great open unsettled of sheep to care for 3 000 of which
 he ran on prairie east of stirling was a boon to sheep and shares for other ranchers sheep herders were
 with cattle men the short grass was abundant in wet the flocks all year and extra hired men were taken
 years and land could be bought or leased on easy on during he summer to help with lambing shear terms
 he acquired land southeast of wrentham ing and putting up hay before their own sheds and moved his sheep here
 this was known as were built the harkers had their sheep sheared the coulee ranch 3 and he became the
 largest at conr ad montana on the harker ranch there sheep r ancher in the area expanding further east was
 a dipping vat where sheep men all around to king s lake and eventually on to the lucky the country
 came in turn to dip their flocks the strike area which was even then available for wool was always taken
 to conrad to be shipped sheep ranching by train supplies such as coal would be shipped although from 1910 to
 1917 he had branched to the harker ranch from skiff or warner out into the wholesale and retail butcher business
 at one time nephi found a small half starved shipping from welling to markets in lethbridge australian blue sheep dog
 near the vats he looked taber blaimiore and other places in the pass and after it and twice that dog
 saved his life bringing had bought the lank brothers dairy at blairmore him and his horse home safely in blizzards
 thus in 1914 combining the two businesses j t ‘ s the australian blue sheep dog was introduced to main
 interest remained sheep the other activities he prairies early on in the sheep business were just sidelines in importance the
 walker family three miles to the west of two good wet years and abundant crops the harker ranch was their
 closest neighbour between 1908 and 1910 had created a need for nephi had hired peter and adam walker to come
 storage for large quantities of grain j t realized from scotland to herd sheep for him they this and in
 the spring of 1910 decided to build has a shingled roof and glass windows and the huge wooden entr ance
 door s are 16 feet wide to permit a team of four hourses abreast to enter easily with a full
 load of hay although its height would seem to so indicate this was not a three storey building nor was
 it completed as j t heninger had originally designed it the ground floor was to house the wintering and feeding
 of 4 000 to 5 000 sheep the second floor was to house the ewes and lambs a lambing house
 with a ramp leading to it from the ground floor the third floor or cupola about sixteen feet square was
 to be john taylor heninger s office in practice much of the construction was never completed but he barn was
 used as a sheep shed with stalls along the north wa ll and partway along each of the east and
 west walls the weighing scale still there is located a little off centre on the south side of the barn
 inside the riser beams like telephone poles are set in foundations of concrete each roof partition was supported by a
 series of these poles coinciding with each roof structure the floor was origina lly dirt but over the year s
 has built up that distinctly unique brand of flooring now about five feet thick known as str awpattie the barn
 was used to house sheep until the death of j t heninger in 1949 it is now under the owner
 ship of he crow indian ranching company owned by pen as schoens morrisons nemeths and douglasses who use the barn
 for cattle in addition to putting up solid structures on concrete foundations j t heninger realized that the days were
 gone when one could simply go out and buy more land the land was no longer available in sufficient quantity
 the time had come when to expand one s oper ation one had to increase the productivity of the land
 one had that is one had to feed more sheep on the same acreage the only way that that could
 be accomplished was by increasing the water supply and that could only be done by irrigation or conservation j t
 used both methods and gained a wide reputation as a water conservationist in 1927 he obtained permission to divert water
 for irrigation purposes from the etzikom coulee in the lucky strike area the water was to be used on pasture
 land that was to be cultivated and was valued at 15 an acre he built many dams over the prairie
 to catch the spring run off so that his sheep could have water near their various grazing areas he built
 several dams at his home place hay lake which he used to irrigate his crops of alfalfa oats one of
 the pioneers of alberta s sheep industry john t heninger is seen here with his wife about 1909 an elevator
 an engineer was brought in from minneapolis to supervise the construction james wilde was the warehouse foreman and the elevator
 was in operation by october 1910 the elevator was later sold to ogilvie flour mills and is still in use
 by the alberta wheat pool j t put up many buildings including a large shearing barn near wrentham later dismantled
 and a hog barn to house a modern hog oper ation amongst many others all these structures were designed with
 permanency in mind to secure that hundreds of tons of cement wer e used even in his own house the
 concrete foundation of the old house barn is now used as the foundation for the house of the pen as

 saturdays besides a mixed train will leave calgary on saturday morning for edmonton and return on monday morning this will
 give a train each way on four days of the week and will be a great accommodation to the travelling
 and business public at present the trains leave calgar y at 9 a m and reach edmonton at any time
 from 8 to 12 p m this is a long and slow ride the inconvenience of arriving at such a
 late and uncertain hour aggravates the case very seriously for the traveller while the local business man is as badly
 off not getting his letters until next morning under the new arrangement there will be a pleasant run at a
 fair and safe rate of speed no delays at points along the line except half an hour at red deer
 for dinner and an early and certain arrival in edmonton plenty of time to reach town before supper and even
 do some business and for an early delivery of mail commercial travellers who have certainly not been lacking in their
 attention to the town may be expected in still larger numbers when they can come in one evening do business
 and go out next morning and if it were summer there is no doubt that a large tourist travel would
 be developed the accommodation train will be of advantage chiefly in moving between points along the line but it might
 be of more business advantage in this way if it ran on other days of the week than saturday and
 monday the concession of this improved train service is a most satisfactory recognition of the growing importance of edmonton and
 will do a great deal to help that growth and importance the fourth train should be accompanied by a corresponding
 increase in the number of mails a board of trade reminder to the post office department would be in order
