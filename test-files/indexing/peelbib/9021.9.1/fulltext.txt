 rambling into the big sand hills rough country with blow holes high ridges sparse bunch grass and ground cedar there
 was nothing in sight until we came close to an old dry gulch there three brush wolves and a bunch
 of magpies came out circled warily and watched me from the top of the gulch rim in range land that
 means something is in trouble a crippled or dead animal and the predators have a prcspective dinner in sight the
 old saddle horse snorted as we rode into the shadows of the brush hidden gulch bottom then i saw it
 one poor buffalo cow was down and dead she looked as if she d died during the night grunting plaintively
 and trying to nuzzle his dead mom was a baby buff i guessed he was about three days old pretty
 weak and gaunt and a really pitiful sight as we rode in closer the ragged and motherless little cuss sure
 looked forlorn and though weak and wobbly true to his buffalo instinct stood up to us tail curved high he
 butted into the horse s shin bones the green eyed brush wolves on the ridge would have had calf steak
 for lunch if we had not happened along buffalo color is pretty well consistent the calves are born with a
 yellow or mustard coat darkening to true buffalo color at about three months the exception of course is the albino
 which is very rare and was generally held in reverence by the indians in the days when the great herds
 roamed free but this little orphan buff was unusually marked he had a small dirty white patch in the centre
 of his forehead so right there and then i gave him the name one spot of all the 39 000
 buffalo raised in the buffalo park reserve from 1909 to 1939 one spot and another young bull with a white
 patch on his ribs and white plume tail were the only two of this large bunch to show any white
 although i always hoped and watched for mr cotton wus for many years with the park service at itainwright and
 is the author of numerous ar ic es on the west now a resident of calgary he is also a
 prominent wood carver of western subjects one spot the buffalo e j bud cotton editor s note this article by
 mr cotton won third prize in the society s recent i ioneer writiitg competition it was down in the big
 sand hills one may day in 1919 that one spot the buffalo my saddle horse and i got acquainted i
 was range riding on the buffalo reserve at wainwright on patrol with my favorite saddle horse frost the 5 000
 odd head of buffalo were pretty well scattered enjoying life after a very hard winter and it was calving time
 these yellow bellies were numerous and gamboling around their moms paw buffalo generally was off ranging clear of his pesky
 and frivolous offsprings his domestic life shattered as mom was too busy baby sitting to give him any attention one
 of those albinos to come on the pint of canned milk water and sugar scene we never had one at
 the park down one spot s throat with the aid of a beer bottle the rest of the quart but
 what to do it was easy to catch ttered over his wet nurse and was spa the little buff he
 d let me get close then the ground but the starved little cuss pile into me a grunting but was
 too seemed satisfied i put him to bed in the weak to do much harm i couldn t leave stall
 next to the saddle gelding who the fighting little cuss there by his dead seemed quite friendly as he sniffed
 his mommy for the brush wolves so i de new stable partner cided to try to take him home to
 the line cabin i tried to carry him on the i took some ribbing from the town saddle but trying
 to hold that kicking druggist a few days later when i bought frightened little brute was an almost im some
 baby nipples and castoria pills possible job then too the saddle horse but one spot thrived on his diet of
 had some objections so rather than canned milk and oatmeal and often not getting bucked off and having to walk
 content with his stable room he would anyway one spot and i decided that ramble into the line cabin if
 the door footwork was best happened to be open he d grunt for a little sugar and kick or bunt
 our shins i figured the baby buff would run if there was too much delay then he away if i
 turned him loose so i carried would lie under the table or bunk conhim for about a mile praying for
 a baby tentedly chewing his cud carriage or something as he was so wiggly and was getting heavier every he
 attached himself to my big saddle yard however everything turned out bronc frost and would follow him fine for when
 one spot squirmed around when in the pasture i used to loose from my tired arms he got the idea
 pen him up when out on patrols for i he would adopt my saddle horse and believe that he would
 have followed us much to the chagrin of the old bronc he all day it was funny too for the
 bronc kept crowding in close to his legs liked him and would start nickering figured frost would kick the day
 when we were nearing the cabin and lights out of him but after a few snorts there at the gate
 would be one spot and sniffs he seemed resigned to the grunting and impatiently asking to be baby buffalo s
 attention fed once fed though he would head getting aboard again we started off for the stable or pasture looking
 for his for home the old horse with nostrils pal the saddle bronc distended and eyes wide stepping along we
 kept spot around for about six gingerly to avoid stepping on little one months or so he was good company
 spot as he wobbled along crowding around the cabin until he got too rough close in to the horse s
 hind legs buffalo and frivolous he was a great tourist fashion as he had done with his attraction especially in
 posing for our mommy picture with the baby buffalo this was one spot would lie down every climaxed one bright
 sunday afternoon half mile or so and would have to be when a bride and groom showed up coaxed to
 get up and go again he was calling some endearing phrases she a bewildered and hungry little buffalo casually walked
 up to one spot he just couldn t understand why all his where he was peacefully sleeping and nuzzling around
 the old bronc s legs grabbed him by the ear she just wanted wouldn t produce something for that a
 sort of chummy pose while hubby empty tummy that was crying to be stood close by with the camera not
 filled charmed by feminine society and peeved at being disturbed from his cozy nap those long twelve miles back to
 the one spot turned all buffalo and line cabin in the battle river hills was butted fast and furious into
 this thing of a slow affair one spot played out and billowing skirts and shrieks i had to carry him
 the last half mile there were no dairy cows around but it hearing the howls i rushed to the was
 the canned milk era for the park rescue and dragged the thoroughly ranger s service and i got the most
 of a aroused one spot away the buffalo herds at wainwright formed one of the largest concentrations of these animals
 in the world although once doomed to extinction the few remaining buffalo thrived in park under the care of the
 canadian government those little stub horns rattling on the female in choosing the company of some lady s shinbones must
 have hurt but handsome young blood instead of an after the rescue when the lady had old decrepit battle scarred
 hero calmed down i was surprised when i heard her bawling out the hubby for so finally he joined the
 old bachelor standing by and howling with laughter bulls that roamed away from the main at the mixup instead of
 coming to her herd happy maybe free of all marital rescue i often wondered just how that cares and strife
 at last but one spot honeymoon trip ended probably that seemed soured on life and only asked groom never mentions
 the word buffalo to be left alone he had no respect for but that incident ended one spot s men
 or horses who tried to corral him camera career so after a session of during the annual fall roundups so
 he chewing up my saddle strings latigoes rambled free and alone in the river hills and other riding gear i
 took him way desiring only to be left undisturbed if out and turned him loose with the main we got
 close to him with a saddle horse herd he d just shake that shaggy whitespotted head and dare the rider
 just to but for years come winter he d al start something that 2 000 pounds of ways show up
 and stick around the old buffalo beef could charge mighty stable corrals begging for a handout fast and certainly discouraged
 any of hay the west line cabin and the ambitious rider from moving him from battle river hills where he
 had been his favorite brush patch bottle raised were always the home range for him but with the snow and
 cold one spot would stake out his claim close to i too liked to see him and held the that
 old line cabin despite his mean idea that maybe he was looking for me disposiiton i believe the old boy
 had the years rolled by and i often saw a kind spot in his heart for me this him with
 the main herd he was mas he showed one morning sive arrogant yet majestic he was boss of his herd
 and ready to fight all it had been around 30 below all night comers during the mating season my the
 frost haze hung in the river coulees baby had grown up all 2 000 pounds as i rambled down to
 one of the spring or more of him heads to open a waterhole for the ammals hoar frost covered the
 willows and each year young bulls grew up and visibility was just about nil as i started contested one spot
 s supremacy in the chopping away and cleaning the ice herd fights and the resultant injuries particles from the bottom
 my ear lugs slowed the old boy up these factors were pulled down and i looked like an were combined
 with the fickleness of the eskimo hunting seals then something told me that all was not right in the a
 host of stetsons and loosened saddle world glancing up i saw him it was horns were the order of the
 day one spot he was only about a yard then it happened riding back to the away intently watching me
 how long line cabin saddle tired after a long he had been there and how he had day s patrol
 i took a shortcut through arrived so silently is anybody s guess a brush covered ravine on an old buffalo
 there were tears in those wicked eyes trail it was dusk with a light snow fall i hoped they were
 for pity but knew that they were only caused by the frost ing both old frost and i saw one
 as i gazed into that homely fuzzy face spot about the same time but it was too late buffalo wise
 the bronc snorted and with its frostily steaming nostrils i real tried to wheel away but one spot ized it
 was the closest i had been to one spot since i had bottle fed him had us just where he
 wanted us right under the bronc s flank those wicked years ago and i sure was hoping that curved horns
 and shaggy head hit the he d remember those tender days i figured any sudden movement on my impact cartwheeled
 the saddle horse down the slope i preceded him and part would precipitate things and it landed in a bunch
 of willows a shakenseemed ever so long that we gazed knowingly into each other s eyes it was up winded
 and scared cowboy luckily useless for me to get up and try to make one spct kept on going and
 a ton a run for it anyway the old saddle or more of peeved buffalo passed me by he looked
 mighty big and his breath horse had discreetly vanished so on smelled bad hands and knees i slowly backed out
 of there expecting any second to see one spot had killed frost his the old bull come snorting in to
 finish old babyhood pal and scared the wits me off but one spot ignoring me out of his wet nurse
 i looked for him completely ambled to the water hole for days after that with blood in my eye for
 a drink with my fur hat riding high and a 303 rifle in my hands swearing i lost no time
 in getting out of there vengeance but i didn t find him maybe he remembered me i waved him as
 usual though when the cold wina glad goodbye and hoped should we ter days arrived one spot rambled meet again
 that there would be a stout in looking for his hay handout he corral fence between us looked quite unperturbed
 and rumbled i was always glad just the same to his pleasure as i grudgingly forked some see the old
 boy show up around the line hay over the corral but he was carrycamp at times though i sure cursed
 the ing a scar along his ribs where i had ornery old fellow especially when rid apparently creased him with
 a wildly ing home only to find him peacefully and hurriedly aimed 303 bullet on lying down right at the
 only gate to the the day we had tangled i had lost all cabin enclosure the only procedure love for
 my adopted baby buff found out after many frustrating tries in 1939 when we cleared all the aniwas to tie
 the old bronc down the fence mals out of the wainwright reserve the a ways walk down to the haystack
 and day of reckoning came for one spot dump over a forkful of hay one spot we shot him in
 the battle river hills he would casually survey the situation was too tough for beef so they turned then slowly
 amble down rumbling his him into pemmican and his hide adorns displeasure at having to walk so far somebody s
 den the scalp lock with its and looking sulky about having to leave white marking i kept for a souvenir
 his strategic position at the gate thus but i ll always want to remember he would let a hungry and
 weary rider one spot as the little orphaned yeland horse get into shelter from the cold low belly buffalo that
 adopted frost as father time took his eventual toll and me down in those sand hills i ll one spot
 became a mean and solitary try to forget that he very nearly sent old gentleman he generally roamed me to
 join those rider s in the sky alone in the timbered river hills any wherever rests his spirit i hope
 he is unwary rider coming close to his hide living happily in a buffalo heaven all out was liable to
 get the shock of his his own but compelled to wear hobbles life as the old bull came charging out

 sunday best walking and driv us naming of medicine hat your readers will be perhaps interested in knowing the indian
 legend connected with the name of medicine hat it is as follows many years ago a battle took place between
 the blackfeet on the one side and a body of crees and sioux on the other which resulted in a
 victory for the blackfeet the scene of the battle was beside what is known among the indians as bitter lake
 a small body of water at the end of the valley here and connected with the saskatchewan the legend runs
 that either during the battle or in the confusion resulting from it the medicine man of the sioux tribe lost
 his hat the symbol of his office among his tribe and by which he was distinguished from the rest of
 them the indians have their peculiar superstition about the losing of the medicine man s hat that if it be
 lost all the herbs roots charms and potions which previously were efficacious in removing the ills of their flesh will
 afterwards be useless accordingly when the battle was over he and a number of his tribe set about to search
 for the lost hat their search proved fruitless but continuing it with the hope of success till late in the
 evening they were amazed and horror stricken on seeing through the deepening twilight apparently standing on the surface of the
 bitter lake for a moment and then disappearing b e n e a t h the waves an immense figure
 bearing the resemblance of a man with hand outstretched on which rested the object of their search the medicine man
 s lost hat such is the legend of the medicine man s hat the sioux call the place paquapi meaning
 a hat on his hand the traditions of the other tribes correspond with this one of the sioux the name
 of the locality in the blackfeet language is ne ye ho the hat on the breast and the cree name
 na ye o the hat on the hand we think the sioux name paquapi a very beautiful one and the
 name that should be given to the town in our opinion the names associated with the localities are the ones
 they should receive and not those having no association with them whatever the regina leader july 5 1883 7 expedition

 after a with a little flour and flints added after few preliminaries one of the warriors got a while a
 stalwart warrior belonging to up shook hands all round and then made another band came forward and made a speech
 it is seldom that a chief un the following speech dertakes to address an assembly but all our bravest men
 are dead we always has his speakers with him whom he advises in council beforehand are now without friends long
 ago my chief said that we would see white war the substance of the speech inter riors to defend us
 now i believe what preted by mr leveille was as follows he said i never saw men like this before
 and i am glad to see them and will give the great spirit gave the land to all them good

 a o ranch for a dance they out to take refuge in the indian tepees packed their clothes in the
 bedding and at the river mr brown disregarded the when they reached slickup lake so warning and he and his
 companion named by the boys on account of the started out on reaching the river the ablutions and general slicking
 up which storm overtook them they debated took place there they donned their whether or not to stay there but

 there that the thriving then with so little cultivated land town was established two and one half everyone turned out
 to fight them miles east of the original site indian rumors fort benton montana word has been received from the
 blackfoot agency to the effect that a few days ago three lodges of blood indians came into the piegan camp
 and stated that the entire blood outfit from north of the line was on the war path old men and
 young and that they were coming on this side to steal horses from the crows and whites and to rob
 and plunder wherever they can it is on the programme to kill cattle whenever they are needed and if opposed
 in their interesting pursuits they will kill their opponents to the last man in short they want it understood that
 they mean business this trip the indians who came into the peigan camp say they would not join the trouble
 there is much too much bluster about this to amount to much but still it would be well for the
 military authorities to be on the lookout there are bloods on this side of the line now and numerous depredations
 have been committed the troops in northern montana ought to be able to put an end to this kind of
