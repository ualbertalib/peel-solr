 edmonton is a city set upon a hill which cannot be hid a place whose domes towers spires and sky

 at night for over fifty miles distance both east and west the edmonton of circa 1840 does not conform in
 any of these respects it was not a city it was not set upon a hill except in the very
 narrowly restricted prospect of one viewing the place from the river level immediately below the fort gates and it could
 be and was very effectually hidden from view until one actually reached it one could have formed no idea of
 just how near or far the fort might still be until the voyager upstream had rounded the last bend of
 the saskatchewan just east of the present 10 5 th street bridge or until the traveller by land had reached
 the very edge of the bench on the south side where the blackfoot trail drops down its narrow coulee beneath

 to be quite arduous van tighem had to build anew father 18 e legal who was in charge of the
 blood bishop grandin consecrated during his indians came to help the priest for long life several weeks and with the
 assistance of the whites the chapel house was built in 1904 father van tighem was called to the general chapter

 were not very fluent in english this trip his first return to belgium in and since we had to speak
 in english twenty years he accompanied bishop every sunday we divided the work be e legal he spent a wonderful
 month tween ourselves each of us had to pre visiting at home the highlight of the pare and give a
 sermon only every fifteen trip came when he had an audience with days but we had to learn it by
 heart st pius x after an absence of seven and word for word months he returned to lethbridge to renew
 his activities he built a chapel when the house was completed in at coutts on the american border where fort
 macleod father van tighem began he went once a month building a little log chapel in pincher thanks to the
 development of coal creek thirty miles west it was built on a hill overlooking the village with mining and irrigation
 the town of letha good view of the rockies some twenty bridge was growing considerably the miles away pincher creek
 was at this ministry became crushing and he was no time a centre of french canadian longer able to carry
 on alone for a ranchers towards the close of 1885 period of fifteen years the priest was father van tighem
 had three churches kept busy with two masses each sunday three sermons and of course catechism to serve fort macleod
 pincher creek confessions and baptisms to be able and lethbnidge when the priest went to work with his people who

 much for one being considerably greater than that of man my parishoners he said were fort macleod the priest was
 transferred good catholics simple in their own to lethbnidge and father lacombe re ways generous towards the church and placed
 him in fort macleod always willing to lend a hand i have baptized the children of some of those at
 first he says i was somewhat whom i married when i arrived in lethlonesome at lethbnidge i had left a
 bridge and i even married some of these good house at fort maclead and here i before i left the
 parish i had the joy had barely a shelter for a while i of baptizing the children and their childhad
 to sleep and study in the choir loft of ren the church he thought it was his duty to ask
 soon the priest built a sanctuary for for some re enforcements therefore he the church and then two small rooms
 asked for five priests for the city and behind it next he built a school for neighbouring places which were
 already the children and in 1890 the faithful quite populated here we have a few companions of jesus came to
 lethbridge reflections of the priest in his diary occupying the convent the priest had which does not lack savour as
 well as built for them up to this time father indicating his profound humility the van tighem had had to
 cook his own following merits to be quoted being meals but with the advent of the sisters no longer able
 to carry on alone i had he ate at the convent to write to my superior to ask for five
 priests immediately then i think i in 1894 he extended the church by made the mistake of my life when
 i half and bishop grandin came to con added that i could not b e the superior secrate it it
 was the first and last that of the community in my simplicity it 19 this is a part of ford
 street in lethbridge as father van tighem knew it in the late 1880 s the priest saw the community grow
 from a small mining town to a prominent centre of southern alberta seemed to me that since i had been
 pas my work at the hospital he says tar in lethbridge for many years i had became very interesting i
 noticed the a right to be superior what presump desire which those poor sick persons had tion on my part
 in writing to my super for my visits they seemed to be disiors and telling them i could not be
 appointed when the hour was over i superior when they had not told me that spent many wonderful moments at
 their i was going to be they had never even bedside always trying to encourage suggested it by writing them
 that i them did not think that i was capable of being superior i was doing that very thing but
 father van tighem thinking this immediately they sent three priests and work demanded too little activity and two more were
 to follow shortly father knowing that there were places in the lestienne was named superior i had south that needed
 priests especially to pack my things and go to edmonton strathmore where there were dutch i left lethbridge on june
 17 1909 my people he offered to start to build new presumption merited my being punished missions his superiors hesitated
 for i was sent to the jail with criminals of some time not wishing to impose a all ages races
 and of every religion pioneer task on a man his age but not having committed every type of crime having
 any other priest to send he was sent again to the south he arrived in father van tighem b ecame

 a single word in a jourof which was written in 1844 nal dr gloven asserts that the use of the
 american ship rather than an another controversy in the career of american ship by thompson implies thompson surrounds his activities

 of his trans mountain posts then the north west company minutes which in 1810 when the americans were on refer
 to thompson s trip as his plans their way to establish a post at the for discovery not our plans
 for dismouth of the columbia thompson began coveny imply he was not under specific his trip to the pacific orders
 it is unlikely that the argument can be settled effectively unless more the first question dr glover asks is conclusive
 evidence is presented was thompson ordered to hurry over the mountains in 1810 11 in order to it is true
 however that thompson forestall j j astor s expedition to secure arrived on the upper saskatchewan the mouth of the

 a shocker and perhaps it was of the athabasca river to a route once intended to be just that there
 is no used by a party of freemen and nipissing maliciousness about it yet no effort is indians this resulted
 in further delays made to spare the man or the legend while the canoes were brought down that has surrounded

 the other hand we question the saskatchewan early in october and had wisdom of placing such a blanket crtinot made

 thompson can provide setbacks when he could not control his evidence to refute any or all of dr gbmen in
 the winter camp and all but one ver s claims their only recourse is to of them deserted with these

 was already established when thompson work and hardly seems to be the place reached the mouth of the columbia on
 for comments which have not been sub j uly 14 th 1811 iected to the scrutiny and rebuttal of it
