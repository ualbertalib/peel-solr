 that took place in the city curiously giving edmonton musicians a place to teach and enough he does not seem
 to have taken part in provided a focus for musical events in the city operas at least not as a
 vocalist although he may to supplement the enthusiastic efforts of local very well have played in the orchestras that acmusicians
 and dramatists there was a constant companied them succession of travelling vaudeville companies the first decades of the 20 th
 century were not light opera companies and dramatic companies a time for musical specialists in edmonton so passing through the
 city vaudeville shows were hendra performed as a violist tenor conductor by far the most common with their coon songs
 and even as a violinist from time to time in may clog dances and cake walks but it was also
 pos 1907 when jean forsyth vocalist and teacher at sible to hear three or four different light operas alberta college
 gave a recital hendra stutch 2 shortly after the edmonton ssmphon orchestra was formed hendra became a member of the
 viola section the orchestra is seen here in 1922 bury and iva wright pianist assisted her me to lake the
 first chair in the violin section among other presentations hendra played it was a little disconcerting for the audience to
 walther s prize song from die mei stersinger on see the concertmaster of the orchestra suddenly the viola 0 less
 than two years later he appeared usc to his fict step to the front and break out as tenor soloist
 in a performance of messiah in in song however in those days we had to make first presbyterian chuith in
 january 1909 the things go one way or another 3 conductor jackson hanby had been about to im the music
 festival for which hiawatha was pieport a tenor but was delighted to discover that the pared was the fourth annual

 sponsored hanby again conducted a choir at first presby a festival in ottawa attended by eight musical and terian church
 this time in a performance of the eight dramatic groups from across the country creation by haydn and again hendra

 stutchbury consulted with the performance of coleridge taylor s hiawatha s vernon barford jackson hanby beatrice craw wedding feast to
 be presented at the annual ford and hendra and they decided that it made music festival in may hiawatha presented
 one more sense to create a regional festival at which of the most striking demonstrations of hendra s many could
 participate than to send a small group versatility in later years he described the occasion of people at great expense
 to a distant city to an edmonton journal reporter thus the first regional music festival in canada i was talking
 to vernon barford the other day came into being in edmonton in may 1908 needand harkened back to his pmduction
 of hiawatha less to say the organizers also played an important in 1911 he had asked me to sing but

 suddenly has made the deep valley of the saskatchewan with its wooded banks a perfect yet changing dream of beauty
 during the past week while the colors lack the brightness and startling variety seen in an eastern forest there were
 so many tinges from light green to yellow with here and there a few dark green spires of spruce standing
 almost black against the lighter color of the dying poplar leaves that the eye was quite as much delighted with
 the softer and harmonious shading as with the startling contrasts of the east the view from any point on the

 miles east of medicine flat on seven persons creek on a ranch 5 which formerly belonged to the packing company
 but which is now the property of mr day four automobiles conveyed the party to the scene of action the

 we saw off in the distance on the open ‘ prairie a bunch of horses grazing as the first automobile
 approached at the rate of forty miles an hour they pricked up their ears and were off ‘ ‘ like

 time ago there was an outcry against doukhobors and and galicians ukrainiansj on the ground that they were foreigners who
 could not be readily assimilated later on the fear was expressed that the canadian west would be americanized by the
 flow of settlers from the united states today there is a controversy over the english immigrant he is charged with
 being a grumbler on his behalf it is said that he often comes to this country under false representations as
 to employment and cost of living and that when he arrives he is coldly inhospitably and rudely treated the raising
 of a race question is a piece of folly the new arrivals and their children will become canadians if they
 remain the question is not one of race but of suitability a russian or austrian peasant may be better suited
 for farm labor in canada than an englishman born and bred in a city to all alike we owe justice
 and kindness we should see that they are not lured to canada by false representations and when they do come
 we should care for them bearing in mind that even the unsuitable ones may be here by the fault of
 others when there is a wave of immigr ation there is a tendency to overdo the business and to exagger
 ate the benefit of an increase of population without regard to suitability in the older countr y there is a
 desire to get rid of those who are not successful and to bundle them off to the colonies with thevague
 idea of making a new start in life certain persons such as steamship agents have a direct pecuniary interest in
 sending out as many emigrants as possible the time has now arrived when the flow of immigration requir es to
 be guided and perhaps checked r ather than encour aged at all events statements as to the advantages of settlement
 in canada ought to be pared down to the strictest accuracy we injure ourselves as well as the immigrant if
 we allow him to be deceived western globe lacombe may 7 1907 9 two british gentlewomen by emma curtin the

 of her versatility and courage is revealed through a particular incident which occurred just after the shaws had arrived in
 alberta on their travels the shaw family had run into a windstorm causing some damage and much confusion helen played
 an important part in gaining control of the situation her lovely golden hair 7 had been messed up during the

 suffering from mal de mer to and show it too is to hear some bumptious very self made and very
 uneducated canadian talk enjoying a skipping match to the delight with 54 against england which she was received by her
 relatives who were tickled to death to see her 3 this first letter her attitudes gradually began to change provides
 a wonderful sense of barbara s cheerful however as she grew to love the freedom of the disposition love of
 adventure and sense of making prairie life and became more accustomed to its the best of everything character traits which

 fact that george s education ‘‘ wasn t niuch 35 after the wedding the newlyweds and hess eight year old
 son marvin left calgary to begin their new life on baraca farm stopping ton a locality established in 1910 with
 little more than a post office about twenty miles from youngstown barbara had reached a turning point in her life

 the hess children the journey was domestic chores and farm work were no disgrace an arduous one by horse and

 might have enjoyed family again in 1924 fifty miles north west to the because of their status in the old
 country these tankerton district of mannville this was to be two british gentlewomen started afresh in alberta the last time

 little time at the family ments within their own domestic sphere remained farm 43 thus with the help of alvin

 vocations of music and often gathered her children around the original farm at mannville still remains in the the piano
 to sing she also gave music lessons to family local children and trained the school choir for annual festivals something
 she may well have done as a teacher in england mrs hess became closely associated with the tankerton school which
 her children attended serving as the secretary treasurer of the school board from may 1926 until june l 940 as
 her children grew older and more independent barbara also became involved in community work she became a charter member of
 the creighton women s institute a local organization of farm women which held its first meeting in the creighton school
 house in august 1932 organizing many fund raising events in aid of local education and later the war effort barbara
 alice slater died on april 13 1941 at the relatively young age of fifty seven her letters remain as testimony
 to the versatility and determination of a woman whose class based education and upbringing had taught her to feel entitled

 suit the tongues of the proverbial fishwife or costermonger but which are shocking falling from the tongues of children of
 tender years of all stupid and silly vices profanity is one of the worst and most abominable a simple statement
 of fact is much stronger than any statement embellished with swear words and no lie is made any the more
 believable by being franied in profanity in fact both truth and falsehood are weakened by swearing and taking the lord
 s name in vain foul epithets and comparisons are not convincing but are almost invariably disgusting except to those making
 use of theni profanity among men seems to be growing less and less at least in public places and among
 those who may lay claim to decency and some education but the habit seems to have firmly fixed itself upon
 a great many of the boys who may imagine it mannish to use profanity and smoke cigarettes western globe lacombe

 god has taken from us two of our darling children katie the delight of my heart and our sweet little
 harry they were taken from us within ten days of each other dear mother seems to have almost a forecast
 of the loss that has befallen me when she says in wishing us happy xmas c one hardly likes to
 be so long ahead of times dates in this uncertain life truly one knows not what a day bring forth
 how different was our xmas to that pictured for us oh how different my darling ill iijii 1 ‘ i
 rtiiil 1914 katie just laid in the cold grave my darling wife on a bed of sickness at death s
 door and myself for the poor little willie as if he was their own watching over my darling harry watching
 for his in fact sister youville calls him her grandson she last breath walter by far from out of danger
 only showed the greatest sympathy with us in our poor little willie who could be said to be out of
 bereavement she had been attending on harriet danger and he like a little orphan as neither his and my dear
 katie but was obliged to go to the mother or i able to care for him had it not been
 mission to look after things she told us to send for the great kindness shown us by the sisters of
 for her if any one was worse when she bid little charity i know not what i should have done
 katie good by the dear child said to her why they nur sed my darling wife children and cared are
 you in such a hurry the last words she ever 20 spoke to her when she came again it was
 to see we had the dear little fellow removed i went my darling a corpse she loved my darling harry
 out shortly after expecting to find that he too had as her own child when he died she said to
 har breathed his last but was surprised to find that riet dear mrs traill i shared your love for that
 he was still alive by this time they had laid out child now let me share your grief and she
 was my darling girl and were making grave clothes sincere he was the only child that would ever for my
 darling boy again i went into the next go to her and not seem afraid of her w room was
 told that he had taken a turn for the i will try and tell you of this very severe trouble
 better he continued to improve and i began to that has come upon us on deer 12 th my darling
 entertain hopes of his ultimate recovery but next harry who had been ailing for some time was day his throat
 began to swell walter then took attacked with the scarlet fever which had been in ill and was very ill
 indeed he gave more trouble the neighbourhood for some months on the night than all the others as he appeared
 to suffer more of the 14 th willie the dear katie were attacked little willie was getting better when the
 dear on the following morning harriet was very sud katie died poor little fellow he was very ill for denly
 taken ill i was obliged to send for the sister 3 days during which time he did not taste food
 superior at the nunnery who came at once and of any kind after that he rallied and was no further
 rendered every assistance in her power we had trouble the greatest difficulty in keeping harriet from i had still walter
 the dear baby to attend to choking the children too got rapidly worse and they both required the closest attention
 walter i thought i would have lost them all at once i being very restless he did not stand pain
 well slept with my darling girl all the time she did when i found that harriet was so bad and
 had not seem to be in so much danger as her brothers such need of some one with her i
 sent a couple till the morning of the 18 th when she rapidly grew of men to fort pitt 170
 miles for mrs mckay worse and before night i saw that she was to be she left fort pitt on
 christmas morning 6 taken from us the baby also was at that time very christmas day was particularly melancholy day
 low indeed tho he lived for several days after with me true harriet was somewhat better but my darling girl
 was so very good throughout walter was very ill and that night my darling her illness never giving any trouble
 but taking harry was very low i watched by him till after the medicines without a murmur never failing to
 midnight expecting every moment would be his thank me dear dear child it was very touching last but after midnight
 he rallied and my hopes the forethought and tenderness she evinced she were again raised it so continued till the
 evening cried nearly all the first night that dear little harry of the 28 th every night he appeared to
 be just took ill little did i think they were so soon both dying and would then rally and appear
 so very to be with their savior the evening of the 18 t h much better that evening just before
 dark mrs she was very delirious altho she always knew me mckay arrived she was pretty tir ed having come
 the dear mother was too ill to render her any from fort pitt in 4 days nights a distance of
 assistance shortly before her death when the 170 miles in rough weather no road she death film was on her
 eyes i asked her do you appeared to think my child might recover shortly know me my darling she replied
 don t ask after her arrival the sister who i had sent for me that again of course i know
 you dear arrived she sat with me while mrs mckay had child it was the last words she said to
 me a sleep he appeared no worse that night than we feared to tell harriet but she perceived it usual
 so after mrs mckay awoke about midat once but was quite resigned she did not night i lay down being
 ver y weary about 3 they however fully realize the dread reality at that awakened me to say that my
 darling child was time at the same time my darling harry was much worse he taken a sudden turn for
 the lying at death s door the sister superior came worse he died in a few minutes after i am
 to me and told me that we must have him moved thankful to say i was spared the pain of
 seeing into the next room as he had but a few moments either of my darlings in convulsions to live
 and that she would not answer for the result it was such a comfort to have dear mrs mckay on
 the mother who was in great danger with us at that most trying time harrict was still 21 harriet william
 traill s ssife is seen here at left in 1913 ssith her mother mrs william mckas and behind theni is
 her sister mrs lass rence clark too weak to realize her loss she was unable to joiced to see mr
 mckay who turned up a few shed a tear for some days after she did not shut days before mrs
 mckay was to start he spent an eye to sleep for four days nights her sense about 4 days with
 us and then the worthy old of hearing was remarkably acute i never saw any couple returned to fort pitt
 65 thing like it no one could speak even in very low walter has been obliged to remain at home
 since tones in any part of the house but she heard it the middle of deer we cannot part with
 him now distinctly the house would be unbearably dull little willie i trust that i am fully resigned to the
 divine will is the life of the house he is very amusing someand i know that my darlings are infinitely
 happier times he begins to tell some romantic story and where they are but still the flesh is weak and
 the if checked for telling stories he says perhaps heart yearns with an unspeakable longing after the it is true
 perhaps only 56 dear absent ones 63 of the five children born to us we have only two left now
 no wonder then february 16 th harriet and the children are if at times we feel our loss very keenly
 remem comparatively well now there remains a ber there are no kind friends and neighbours to great deal of sickness
 in the neighbourhood come in and console us 4 the burden falls chiefly scarlet fever there is not now a
 family heavier on my dear harriet who at the time was that have not had it or have it now
 there are sick so dangerously ill as not only to be quite unable in every house in some dwellings there
 are only to nurse the dear sufferers but she was unable one or two on their feet there have not
 been to realize at the time the death of her children many deaths as yet but i fear more will
 ensue she could not weep she always said that she did harriet and i watch with a friend over his
 sick not feel that they were dead but that they had gone children there are five sick in the house
 we away on a visit now she realizes in all its fullness hear of sickness in every quarter mrs hardisty
 the sad reality and feels the loss in a two fold is we hear very ill so also her sister
 mrs harridegree son young at slave lake we are well enough mrs mckay stayed with us about 3 weeks off
 for grub but the people around us are living till harriet full recovered we were greatly re from hand to
 mouth 22 spring 1879 has a few very easy lessons but they do not we cannot but be sad at
 times i have brought occupy much of his time harriet to edmonton for a change of scene and i believe
 we will see more or less of the surair i could not bear to see her moping so we veyors
 this summer they are going to explore left ll biche on the 7 th of may and came here the
 country near lac la biche for a railway route staying a day at victoria as i was unwell that i
 am acquainted with the head surveyor mr day we lay in camp harriet stood the journey very king who is
 from port hope and an exceedingly well and the children enjoyed it as they generally nice gentlemanly fellow i met
 him at edmondo walter rode the whole way on his pony ton two years ago i shall be glad to
 see them bob walter is improving the time while we hope they may remain in our neighbourhood some stay here
 by going to school master willie is time supremely happy when the other children are at i believe my chance
 of promotion is pretty good home but when they are off to school he don t as i am first
 on a list of thirteen who have been know what to do with himself proposed and of whom about six
 will probably harriet is going to go down to fort pitt and will be promoted all the officers in these
 parts i probably remain there for some months it seems mean in this department voted for me so my the
 past winter has been an unhealthy one all over chance is fair but i must not be too sanguine in
 the winter was cold and there was a great deal deed there is no great reason to be elated for
 at of distress in this country owing to scarcity of pro best it will only be a junior trader ship
 which will visions of all kinds fish buffalo were very not bring me a fortune but at worst is worth
 150 scatte rabbits are a great stand by in this country per annum however it will be welcomed if it
 when other food fails but they were very scarce comes better late than never i had quite made the past
 winter the indians starved miserably on up my mind to try my fortunes at stock raising the plains in the
 woods one indian was appre or something else at the expiration of my present hended yesterday within a few miles
 of this ed engagement which terminates in ‘ 81 monton house for having eaten up his wife i have had
 two or thr ee letters from walter this family during the winter there was a similar case summer he says
 that he writes often but the letlast year only the man merely ate two of his sons ters go astray
 he is about selling a piece of in this case he ate his whole family 68 ground that he bought
 for me when i was at grand forks in ‘ 76 and which has turned out a very good speculation
 summer 1879 i went to down to fort pitt on the 28 july ultimo to see after some business and
 pay a visit fall 1879 to my dear wife i am thankful to say i found both i am very
 lonely here llbj by myself having her the children quite well but i cannot take no company of any but
 my books i am anxious them back with me but will leave them until in mind about my darling wife
 i suppose her conafter harriet s confinement with ethel which finement will take place about a month hence will make
 her return to me very late in the fall from september 14 th as there are no telegraphs i trust
 i may have the delight of seeing her re i shall not hear a word till i go to meet
 her in stored to me all right with a dear little child to november so you can judge how r
 estless i shall fill in a measure the blank in our circle i shall be till that time last night
 i lay awake for hours probably leave on the 5 th or sixth august at thinking about her i could
 not sleep till near daylatest were harriet able to travel she would on light and such a night it was
 it rained torrents no account remain behind mr mrs mckay and was so dark that lying in bed without light
 are both the same kind friends that they have ever i could not distinguish the windows the beat of been
 mr mckay has been down at carlton for the waves on the shore just below the house was some weeks
 and only returned a few hours after oppressive my thoughts were very much on my my arrival the dear boys
 are very happy here darlings who are now in heaven sometimes i having nothing to do but play walter it
 is true dream of them no long since i thought my 23 darling katie was with me i was sitting
 in the before he wrote it is true that there have been rocking chair and she was on my knee
 with her no dividends for some years but the share holders arms about my neck and was kissing me over
 have given a guarantee of 750 per annum in case over again as so so often used to do what
 a there are no dividends so that sum may be set terrible disappointment for me to wake and find down
 as the minimum salary of a junior trader it was a dream a dream than can never be not only
 so but that 750 is equal to twice my realized it is strange little harry with his former salary of
 500 because i get my supplies smile temper is so seldom in my thoughts at a much lower percentage have
 a considerable compared with my other darling increase of allowances i e groceries of course i count the days as
 they go by till i shall see in the event of the company realising a profit my beloved ones again
 surely i am blessed in my salary would increase in proportion and we having a wife who is one with
 me absent and may reasonably hope that when the present finanpresent others would find her no doubt a very cia
 depression in europe is at an end that our afcommonplace woman and so no doubt she is in fairs will
 improve and that the good old times of many ways but only those who know her spirit profit may return
 at any rate i will be thankful as i do can ever know her real worth i can con for
 present mercies scienciously say that we never disagree in any the sweet little ethel is very well and as full
 thing her heart is ever tender towards any one of smiles as she can be she always laughsj in distress
 and her hand is also liberal she never when she catches my eye or hears my voice she yet turned
 a deaf ear on a tale of distress there never cries when she awakes but laughs at any was a
 birth in our neighbourhood and all the one who goes near her not that she don t require women as
 usual collected harriet as she usually nur sing for she is never contented unless someone does sent some chocolate sugar
 c c the has her she never cries except from hunger or ladies were regaling themselves thereon when one when
 she wants to be taken up she is very strong began to sigh and appear very dejected when her on
 her legs and can almost sit alone she is going neighbour s enquired the reason she said i wish to
 have teeth soon which is a wonder for none that i too was going to have a baby why you
 of ours have had teeth till they were a year old have lots of children and you are getting old
 walter is still going to school where he makes yes but when ever i had a baby oke mas quato
 good progress the nuns say that he had a great the lady always used to give me chocolate aptitude for
 learning but they don t consider him sugar flour c but as it is i never taste such strong and
 say that it would be injudicious to force things 7 him to learn he understands french well converses a little
 now with the mission people at home is ver y shy of showing off his accomplish winter 1879 80 ments
 in french i tried him the other day with the month of december was extremely cold but a french vocabulary
 and was well pleased with january was not remarkably so but instead was his progress his pronunciation is very good
 you ver y stormy so indeed has this month february might say perfect so far as his knowledge of the
 been hitherto there is a general scarcity of fish language goes about the lake of other provision throughout master willie
 is the same harum skarum as the country except in the settlements where the full of life as he can
 be he keeps the house in settlers depend upon their own recourse not a roar a litter i never saw
 a child so fond of upon fish or buffalo cutting up paper making a litter generally he the last mail
 brought me no canadian letters is very fond of his little sister we have a little but i had a
 short note from mr clarke con indian girl that we have adopted she is a little gratulating me on having
 received my commis older than willie willie plays with her when his sion i have not seen it yet but
 supposed it has brother is at school he is always so glad to see gone up to edmonton and will
 come to hand the his brother when he comes from school he is first chance clarke had seen it or
 had been offi always speaking of what he will do when he is cially apprised of its having been awarded
 me big but i am sorry to say smoking is one of the 24 view of the catholic mission buildings
 at lac la biche things he aspires to when he is a man of 2 cart wheels and a few
 willows the con tom mckay who lives at prince albert is struction of such a craft seldom occupies more doing

 college for bishop saskatchewan who resides days ago as of july 25 th and will be away more there when
 at home but he spends most of his than two weeks yet i had a note from harriet time abroad
 begging if my boys are spared to us yesterday by the man who brought the letters we will send them
 there instead of sending them harriet s man had killed a moose they expected farther from home 7 to reach
 pitt today the children were quite well when she wrote little ethel very good mr summer 1880 mrs mckay will
 be so glad to see them ethel there is great abundance of wild fruit of all was only 8 or
 10 days old when h left last fall kinds strawberries raspberries c and a fruit mr mckay is just as
 fond of his grandchildren that grows in the muskegs the plant is very like as he is of his own
 and that is saying a great deal a geranium but the fruit about the size colour as he is quite
 wrapped in his family so also is of wild raspberries it is very luscious and makes mrs mckay a preserve
 that a lmost resembles honey in flavour last night july 25 we had a tremendous storm transparency fish have been
 very scarce all of thunder lightning with hail and the heaviest summer we have received no imported provi rain i
 ever experienced it came through the roof sions as yet so we have not been too well off altho like
 a seive the fences were blown down and we always had enough for ourselves we can every thing flooded no
 tent could have stood always kill beef when too hard up but of course before it for a minute my
 garden was beaten as when not actually starving i don t like to do so 72 fiat as a floor
 and some plants buried others i only lately returned from edmonton as of july washed out by the roots two
 of my men are out 25 th 1880 i was absent 29 days the rivers on a trade should be
 on their way home if so were all flooded so we had to cany the skin canoe they must be
 nearly drowned as they have no and use it frequently i did not even cany a tent covering but their
 blankets 73 harriet was on the i enjoyed myself well enough at edmonton but road during the storm and this
 caused me much the trip to fro was a very rough one uneasiness til i heard that she was safe
 the storm i am all alone again at lac la biche harriet did not pass near them altho it raged
 over an the children are off to fort pitt on a visit i will extensive piece of country making a
 clear sweep go and meet them at beaver river when i expect where it passed the rivers are all high
 and the them home the rivers are all high so h has to roads nearly impassible the lake is higher
 than carry a skin canoe two hides sewn together ever seen by the oldest inhabitant and hor ses which are
 converted into a canoe on a framework have to swim two creeks between this the mis 25 sion we have
 had no strangers in the way of ton who i invited when i was there last fall he surveyors policemen
 c but today is the time only stayed two days we are well off this winter appointed for payment of
 the indian annuities but for everything except furs they are very not a sign of paymaster staff or other s
 they scarce 76 really mismanage these things shamefully 74 at new yearsj we have to feast everyone that comes a
 long and kiss all the women from the baby fall 1880 girl in the was pessoon up to the old
 toothless i left lac la biche two weeks ago as of sep hags such as burns described in tom o
 shanter tember 20 18801 and came up to edmonton with we began the feast at sunrise and it was sunset
 my son walter who cannot go to school on account before we got through during which time the of high
 water at llb i had occasion to come here table was full continually altho they were still on business so
 left w with the hardistys who coming we ran off being invited at a neighbour s have a boy much
 about his own age and with house where there was a dance not that we whom w is great friends
 we left all well at home danced except walter who joined in a jig we the little ethel is i
 suppose walking now if she merely went to get rid of our tormentors is in health harriet will be very
 dull during our we are just weaning miss ethel who is not very absence i met a great many strangers
 at edmon troublesome willie has a sore throat and harriet ton mr hardisty s house is always crowded with is
 complaining a little 77 w illie always suffers a government officials surveyors c good deal when he catches sore throat
 it seems we have had a cold wet and very disagreeable to be like a croup with him and we
 treat him summer the most unfavorable season for agricul accordingly 78 little ethel is a funny little soul ture that
 i have ever known the fall frosts set she tries hard to speak she calls the pig koo in much
 earlier than last year the crops are still koo which she means for koo koosh which standing for want of
 weather suitable for harvest is cree for pig she imitates koo koo very well ing them and a great deal
 of the wheat oats she calls horses kuldies she likes to feed herself ar e damaged by the frost the
 garden on the whole but spills it all over walter has most of the nurshas been good and we have
 some ver y fine vegeta ing on his hands just now our girl peggy is bles altho some of the
 seeds only reached me in a very smart tidy little woman i hope if we are june removed from this
 as i expect will be the case i anticipate a hard winter for the natives last that she will go
 with us 9 winter was ver y hard but i fear this coming sea i would gladly send harriet down
 to canada son will be worse on account of scarcity altho next summer but she won t hear of it
 because she we may reasonably hope for a warmer winter than could not join me for a full year she
 says that last which was the coldest on record i have made when she is with her own father mother
 she my house more comfortable than it ever was be is miserable if i am away and she would be
 worse fore harriet is not by any means strong she if she were among total strangers 8 m i am
 afr aid cannot stand hard work and it is hard to get good harriet cannot go home to canada till
 the c p r servants in this country little ethel is very is finished the papers speak of it being
 complete amusing so is willie the mails have changed in three years surely in that time they will be able
 their routes so that i am more cut off from the to give me a furlough i never greet with
 any of world than i have ever been since i came to the my old friends in the country but
 i suppose some countr y i keep my health well the throat always of them will find their way to
 saskatchewan bothers me niore or less but the doctor has given i have not been at edmonton this winter i
 am me something now which i hope will give me longing for letters and yet after being long without relief
 harriet suffers at times from toothache but intelligence from home am half afraid of hearing she is too great a
 coward to have it drawn bad news our joys are seldom unmingled in this world whooping cough has been very
 prevalent winter 1881 in our settlement i am thankful to say my chil we had one visitor with us at
 christmas mr dren have escaped so far and as there are now few william anderson indian agent from edmon cases
 of it i hope they may escape altogether 8 26 i have been told by mr hardisty that this will
 like an old man but nearly all his funny sayings probably be my last winter at lac la biche he
 are in cree did not intimate where he intended sending mc the weather just now is fine altho rather sharp
 but from other sources i learn that it is to slave we had very cold rough weather in octr novr
 lake lesser slave lake to distinguish it from but now i think we are going to have fine weather g
 s lake which is very far north l s lake is there is not more then 4 inches of snow
 which about 300 miles north edmonton so you may be is unusual at this season we have never had sure
 i have no great reason to congratulate my the thermometer below 40 and seldom so low self on the change
 more especially as i am only now beginning to make myself comfortable here however perhaps i may be more comfortable
 sumntnu 188 there if i really go but of course nothing is deter we left our old home at lac
 la biche on sunmined as yet i regret the change for harriet s day morning the 12 th june not
 that i ever travel sake 82 we will be out of the way altogether on sunday when avoidable but all
 our crew being there you need only expect to hear from us once catholics were anxious to attend mass at
 the misin a while say 3 times a year there will be sion where we remained over night we were
 very no society at all there here we have the nuns and kindly received by the good nuns priests who
 one or two besides we also have a chance professed great regret at our departure government official or police officer
 there we we had to take some cargo for the mission so will see no one it was noon the
 next day before we got started walter is not going to school this winter we the kindness and attention we
 received from one try to teach him a little ourselves but i am sorry and all could not have been
 greater and we left to say we are by no means regular and he does all the nuns in tears
 they were very much atnot learn much in consequence willie does not tached to harriet and the children they followed
 know all his letters yet he does not seem to care us to the water edge a midst good wishes
 kind about tr ying to learn he is not dull however but words several of my old opponents took the
 troucan pick up anything quick enough i think he is ble of riding to the mission several miles to bid
 quicker in that respect than his brother he speaks me goodbye and one and all appeared sorry for ii a

 turn of the century there were no deep freezes or other facilities for keeping beef fresh during the hot summer
 months as a result farmers often had cattle on the range but no meat in the pantry because it spoiled
 so quickly the problem was solved by some farmers when they banded together to form a beef ring which slaughtered
 one animal a week and distributed the meat to each participating family the pr actice became so popular that the
 feder al government issued guidelines for persons wishing to form a ring the following article published by the lethbridge news
 june 30 1904 is based upon those guidelines although livestock is grown on almost every may exchange numbers if they
 find it mutually canadian farm the farmer as a rule finds it very advantageous two small families may combine difficult
 to furnish his table with fresh meat during for one share the summer months salt pork and poultry are in

 shall supply a steer or heifer of fresh beef would make the problem of preparing under three years old sound
 healthy and in good meals much easier for the women of the house condition dressing from 400 to 500 pounds
 of hold and would ensure a more wholesome and beef and grain fed for at least six weeks previous palatable

 it both inconvenient and expen supply another or it may be accepted at a lower sive to send a member

 sale of beef but are groups of ber and hangs thereon the portion for each family farmers who co operate

 fact that a successful exportation of canadian creamery butter to china has met a successful sale at remunerative prices notwithstanding
 the heavy freight charges from eastern canada to the coast via c p r and thency by sea to china
 should attract the attention of butter makers to alberta the greatest field for daiy products in the whole of canada
 and the nearest to the china markets canadian cheese has made its mark on the european markets and from this
 the trade has assumed mammoth proportions and it now forms the largest single item of our exports canadian butter however
 has not kept pace with cheese in the european markets as it has been claimed that the long sea voyage
 deteriorated its quality and it was thus not able to compete with the butter nearer the market china however wilt
 not have much choice as canada will have advantage over any other competing countr y and as alberta is the
 nearest large dairy district of the dominion to this market there should be no reason why she should not have
 the call on the market although as yet sufficient butter has not been raised to supply the home demand this
 is a state of affairs that cannot exist much longer last year there was more butter produced in alberta than
 ever before and this year bids fair to exceed it many times fainthearted ones have asked many times where is
 our market to come from provided we do raise a quantity for export and now the question is answered china
 with her teeming millions will want all the butter that canada can spare her and if the farmers of alberta
 are alive to their own interests hundreds of tons can be shipped every year eastern canada whose lands are worth
 30 40 and 50 per acre and where cattle have to be fed six months in the year can ship
 two thousand miles further by rail than we have to ship why should not alberta s farmers who have many
 acres of the richest pasture land in the world watered by the purest streams and springs and where the climate
 allows the cattle to range for at least ten months is the year without any fodder do so with a
 greater profit when these facts are taken into consideration we cannot but come to the conclusion that these prairies must
 yet become the happy and prosperous homes of thousands who will reap the advantages which a bounteous nature supplies to
 those who will reach out their hands to grasp them calgary tribune january 23 1889 30 western bookshelf winter sports
