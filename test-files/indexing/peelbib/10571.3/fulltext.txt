 41 r he modern rifleman by captain f f worthington m g m m p p c l i por 
 perhaps seventy years or more the infantryman has been faced with the unpleasant fact that as the volume and accuracy 
 of small arms fire increased so has his ability to stand up to the attack decreased at first it was 
 hardly perceptible but like a large wheel gathering momentum the true condition became more and more apparent there is little 
 evidence however of the truth being fully realized during the years proceeding 1914 although the british appeared to have grasped 
 the significant importance of weapon skill as witnessed by the musketry proficiency of the old army after the first deluge 
 in 1914 the automatic weapon was elevated to royal honours as a defensive arm and took its toll of human 
 life thereby drenching the battle fields with the blood of infantry who vainly endeavoured to fulfil its time honoured 0:hon 
 0:oured role preponderance of numbers in the attack only served to swell the butcher s bill so long as those 
 automatic arms remained 0:re 0:mained intact a series of great battles were fought from first to last with little to 
 show save a staggering casualty list of infantry now nothing is easier than to offer criticism in the light of 
 after events and condemn tnose who failed on account of a defective vision on the other it is so very 
 human to develop a set of preconceived ideas which are handed down from father to son as it were therefore 
 it is not strange to find happen wht did happen in the bloody years of 1914 and on this is 
 particularly easy to understand when we look back on the years directly following tho war and see what took place 
 within the infantry but out of tho welter of opinions has emerged a more or less definite doctrine as to 
 tho functions of the rifleman as yet it is far from being complete and in its wake have risen several 
 groups of counter opinions usual in such conversions the first extreme are those who still look back on the good 
 old days fully convinced that the infantry was still is and ever will be the queen of the battle field 
 so long as no change in training is made on the other extreme are those v ho contend that modern 
 infantry can occupy and hold but not capture ground therefore must be relegated to a lower catagory than heretofore certainly 
 it would appear that the cycle of development leans toward the latter extreme when viewed from the standpoint of weapons 
 the newer organization which we have seen come into being 0:be 0:ing during the past few years savours of defence 
 
 42 what little attention the infantry has received has been mainly associated with the perfection of its predominantly defensive weapons 
 certainly the fifleman as such has been given but little consideration true such catch phrases as fire with movement soft 
 spots spirit of the bayonet had their innings but have finally faded out of the picture there are now indications 
 from which it would appear that the rifleman may receive something more than a wave of the hand and a 
 few kind words i call attention to sec 51 of the new infantry section leader training wherein a formula of 
 three aids are given for the rifleman to fulfil his object in the attack i e cover formations and fire 
 it is now fully recognized that for a rifleman to attack over open ground is fatal to success unless the 
 enemy s fire is completely subdued it is equally well recognized that to give this adequate fire support means to 
 draw upon every available 0:avail 0:able resource to the fullest extent which opens the whole question of infantry values to 
 severe criticism let us admit then that open ground is not suitable infantry 0:in 0:fantry ground which incidently is precisely 
 what the above quoted manual suggests and pay particular attention to the type of ground best suited to wit enclosed 
 ground immediately we do this we must think in terms of fighting under these conditions which leads us at once 
 to the question of supporting fire by the same process of deduction it will be seen that the more dense 
 the enclosed area is the less fire support is possible therefore the rifleman is more dependent upon his own resources 
 the result is that the more adroit the rifleman is in scout and field craft the better are his chances 
 of success in other words if he can acquire man3 r of the qualities of the primitive hunter as suggested 
 in the new training sc manoeuvre regulations he is an efficient rifleman if not he is but so much cannon 
 fodder this does not moan reverting to the stone age but to model our methods after such experts in scout 
 and field craft as for example certain tribes of north american indians the north american indian was no mean fighter 
 and what superiority the white man could claim at the outset was mainly in fire arms and fire water however 
 as time went on the white man did acquire the methods of the red man and proved his equal in 
 turn i think that we too have much to learn from his manner of fighting in close country to illustrate 
 this let me take you back one hundred and seventy years to a little frontier town in new hampshire where 
 one robert rogers received his early education as he himself modestly said m i could hardly avoid some knowledge of 
 the customs 0:cust 0:oms and manoeuvres of the indians furthermore i acquired acquaintance with the uncultivated deserts mountains valleys rivers 
 lakes and passes 
 43 he comes into our picture in 1755 just prior to the time when braddock met defeat at the hands 
 of the french and indians on the monongahela his military career is commenced by providing escorts to provision waggons between 
 albany and fort edward n y his ability appears to have been recognized very early in the campaign as he 
 carried out a series of reconnaissances 0:reconnaiss 0:ances to ticonderoga and crown point later he harassed the french communications with 
 montreal even carrying out a daring raid on the indians at st francis on the st lawrence river between 0:be 
 0:tween montreal and quebec all of which was over hostile territory full of hostile indians thoroughly aroused and eager for 
 scalps he was at the capitulation of canada and commanded the troops who moved by boat from montreal to the 
 capture of detroit in 1760 during this period he raised organized and trained a body of troops later known as 
 the queen s rangers records show that he conducted what would now be called courses of instruction the training of 
 selected officers of the regular army such regiments as the buffs 3rd the king s own 4th the cheshires 22nd 
 the inniskillings 27th the black watch 42nd the essex regt 44th the northamptonshire regt 48th the border regt 55th and 
 k r r are among those who had officers under his tuition rogers kept a journal during these years which 
 he had printed in 1765 he says with apologies it was not written in silence and leisure but in deserts 
 on rocks amidst the hurry disorders and noise of war the circumstances described above only tend to enhance the value 
 of what he has to say in the matter of fighting and on which he has compiled twenty eight trite 
 maxims a few of which i take liberty to quote iv some time before you come to the place you 
 would reconnoitre 0:re 0:connoitre make a stand and send two men to look for the best ground for making observation 
 vi if you march in a large body with design to attack divide into three columns abreast let proper guards 
 be kept in front and rear with suitable flanking parties at due distance let them halt on all eminences to 
 take view if you are attacked keep out the flanking parties to keep the enemy from pressing hard on your 
 wings which is the usual method of the savages vii if you are obliged to meet the enemy s fire 
 fall or squat down till it is over then rise and discharge at them be careful to support and strengthen 
 your flanking parties advance from tree to tree some firing the while viii if you oblige the enemy to retreat 
 be careful in your pursuit to keep out flanking parties and prevent them from gaining rising ground where perhaps they 
 would rally and make a stand 
 44 ix if you are obliged to retreat let the front party fire and fall back till the rear hath 
 done the same this means you will oblige the enemy to pursue in the face of constant fire x if 
 the enemy is so superior that you are in danger of being surrounded let the whole party disperse each taking 
 a different road to a place of rendezvous appointed if surrounded form a circle and make a stand till darkness 
 doth favour your escape xiii when pushed upon by the enemy reserve your fire till they approach very near which 
 will put them in great surprise and consternation and give you an opportunity of rushing upon them with your hatchets 
 xiv when encamped for the night fix on sentry posts in such a manner as not to be relieved till 
 morning each sentry post to be six men with two on the constant alert if they see or hear anything 
 which alarms them they are not to speak but one is to acquaint the commander at the first dawn of 
 day awake the whole party that being 0:be 0:ing the time when savages choose to fall upon their enemies xvii 
 before you leave your camp send out small parties to scout around it to see if there is appearance of 
 tracks of the enemy that might have been near you during the night xix if you have to cross rivers 
 avoid the usual fords lest the enemy should have discovered you and be awaiting xxi if the enemy pursue your 
 rear take a circle till you come to your own tracks and then form ambush xxii when you return from 
 a scout and come near to our forts avoid the usual roads thereto lest the enemy should have headed you 
 and formed ambush xxiii when you pursue any party follow not directly on their tracks but endeavour by different routes 
 to head them compare these maxims of the ranger with those set out in infantry section leader training and you 
 will observe a great similarity from which you may draw your own conclusions 4 s e if jjc 
 45 c q m s c w norton with the going to pension of c q m s c w 
 norton we have lost one of our old timers who will be greatly missed by all ranks c q m 
 s norton joined us at london ontario on april ist 1920 and since then has made himself well loved by 
 everyone fortunate enough to serve with him q m s norton first became a soldier on the bth july 1893 
 when he joined the bedfordshire regt at hertford of the 12 years 292 days he spent with that regiment over 
 11 years were spent on foreign service mostly in india during this time he was awarded the india medal 1895 
 with the clasp for the relief of chitral the 23rd of september 1914 again saw q m s norton in 
 uniform and for over five years he served with the c e f in canada england and france in addition 
 to the chitral medal he now has the 1914 1915 star british war medal victory medal and the medal for 
 long service and good conduct for over fourteen years q m s norton has been with the regiment and we 
 are genuinely sorry to lose his services it is our earnest hope that q m s and mrs norton have 
 many years of happy life ahead of them they are making their home in esquimalt where they can come often 
 to see us 000 0:000 
 46 esquimalt station notes field training l934 on august 29th at 0730 hours b company marched out of barracks on 
 their way to comox 8 c for annual field training the journey was made on h m c s skeena 
 whose personnel did everything possible to make the trip a pleasant one we were honoured on this voyage by the 
 company of major general e c ashton c m g v d district officer commanding m d no 11 the 
 morning was cold and foggy but about noon the sun cleared away the mist and in the latter part of 
 the journey we were treated to a very interesting and convincing display of naval gunnery and torpedo work h m 
 c s vancouver which accompanied us acted as target for the gunnery practice and h m c s armentieres which 
 came down from comox to meet us was the target for the torpedoes about 7 00 p m we arrived 
 at our destination and got our camp organized that night lieut h f pullen r c n and about fifty 
 ratings were in camp on tho spit and made us welcome unfortunately the ships had to put back to esquimalt 
 in the early hours of the morning but we soon settled down to a friendly routine with the naval camp 
 indeed it was surprising how sailorly our troops became aye aye sir i was soon the standard reply to an 
 order and one man is on record as announcing to the adjutant that the p o cook wants to see 
 yovi sir parades gave way to the ancient practice of piping all hands on deck and our semaphore experts insisted 
 on making a signal to a distant station rather than merely sending them a message tho following week was devoted 
 to field training the rifle platoons took possession of the range and daily attacked myriads of target enemies with great 
 dash and elan varying this with treks into the surrounding country to harden up a bit before the long walk 
 home the machine gunners formed a whaler s crew and coxwained by sgt henry rowed vigorously about the neighbouring sea 
 planting targets consisting of anchored logs etc which were later effectually annihilated from gun positions on the spit after viewing 
 these nautical adventures one well known person remarked that all machine gunners are crazy we wonder on the lighter side 
 of things the navy entertained us to a corn boil on the spit on friday 31st august unbelievable quantities of 
 corn cobs testified to the good trencher work done by all present and left us wondering just where the time 
 and energy came from for all the good hearty songs that featured the evening on the following monday there was 
 a return 
 47 engagement when both services met in a smoker which was voted a complete success by all present unfortunately on 
 this same monday the machine gun platoon had to leave for home due to a fiery threat to our estate 
 at heal s range a fuller explanation is to be found elsewhere in this volume but it must be stated 
 that it was hard to leave just as the provisions for the smoker were being unloaded onto the jetty however 
 they got away and arrived home by bus late that night the rest of the company finally said good b 
 e to comox on thursday 6th september and boarded the joyful and numerous smaller craft to the mainland jetty on 
 the first leg of the journey home the first day s march brought us to tsablo river where we camped 
 for the night c s m mitchell armed with a great spear went in search of some marine additions to 
 the larder but was attacked by greatly superior forces of hornets who left sundry mementoes of their visit on the 
 c s ms neck and head at qualicum our second day s halting point the river provided 0:pro 0:vided fairly 
 good fishing and major colquhoun got in a bit of good shooting yes the season is open marching conditions so 
 far had been excellent but worse was in store for us our third day s march brought us to craig 
 s crossing where nature not satisfied with the proximity of limitless quantities of seawater 0:sea 0:water gave us a heavy 
 rain storm which thoroughly soaked everyone 0:every 0:one and everything in camp sergeant mcvie became a casualty here and had 
 to return home by some more comfortable method suffering from a bad case of stomach ulcers next day we marched 
 over a great number of formidable hills to arrive eventually at departure bay where t e had a day s 
 halt it wa a real treat to discover a reasonably level piece of ground again and the sea bathing was 
 excellent there were many rumours current that our machine gunners would rejoin us here but our look out proved abortive 
 the having decided to remain firemen and leave the marching to the rest of us on tuesday the 11th we 
 marched on through nanaimo remembered 0:re 0:membered chiefly as a watery blur the rain had started again with a vengeance 
 and after halting for lunch within sight of cassidy s pub of loving memory to the emma gees continued along 
 to ivy s green where we made our next camp some slight difficulty was experienced in getting fires to burn 
 in the everpresent 0:ever 0:present rain but we were soon settled down for the night wednesday morning looked a bit 
 cloudy and the command quick march was apparently the long awaited signal for at that word down came the rain 
 again and it was no gentle showert at chemainus we fortunately got the use of a hall for our lunch 
 
 48 and wore able to get the water out of our eyes the afternoon took us past t f ostholme 
 to warwick house where we made our billet for the night on thursday we passed through duncan and lunched at 
 the indian reserve at cowichan bay beuna vista hill was a bit terrifying and took a bit of effort when 
 we tackled it but we made camp all intact by this time c s m mitchell had developed some really 
 sporting boils on his neck and head in which affliction 0:afflic 0:tion he had tho company of lance corporal nicholson 
 lieut sutherland and cpl bundock also were displaying bandages this time about their knees which were not in tho best 
 of shape however on friday we all got off to a good start and after crossing brentwood bay on the 
 ms cascade reached heal s camp and hot baths that night hu s to sleep in and plenty of hot 
 water for showers were treats that beggar description and it was a happy company that retired at an early hour 
 that evening 0:even 0:ing saturday morning the 15th wo marched into barracks at tentwenty 0:ten 0:twenty to the music of 
 our own drums glad to be back home the possessors of boils mal de knee etc took care to remove 
 all sign of bandages at the last halt and we came into range of sgt henry s cine kodak showing 
 no signs of the wear after the march 000 0:000 0:er 0:s of tho march generally much could bo said 
 the rain at times rather soriousl3r hampered the work of our mouth organ band who found that their instruments were 
 almost perpetually full of water and inclined to be a bit squeaky while tho same element prohibited the use of 
 drums for about half the march however we made up for all that in tho last two days when the 
 band did good work and certainly helped to clock off the miles the c s m had serious misgivings for 
 awhile about whether he would make it but a consultation with dr bark and his horoscope brought such predictions of 
 glorious success that all doubts vanished sgt mcvie we understand will sit for the next interpreter s 0:interpret 0:er 0:s 
 examination in gorman since the advent of his bevy of dobormann pinschers q m s i wood and sgt smith 
 reminded us of treasure island as they made trip after trip with the jolloy boat from the spit to comox 
 for further provisions it was a joy to any sailor to see them loaded until the gunwales were practically submerged

 in the amphitheatre on september 27th 28th and 29th and was again a great success a class of 40 members 
 of the regiment put on a display of physical training and gymnastics that proved one of the feature numbers of 
 the sho r with many grunts and groans the squad got into training during august under q m 3 1 
 harper and when the tournament came off were in the best of form the display opened with the squad doubling 
 into the arena and breaking out into a maze drill which finished in open formation in the centre then followed 
 a p t table of twelve exercises without word of command after which the class went to the vaulting horses 
 which had been placed in position before the show commenced fourteen exercises were done over the three horses the act 
 ending in a tableau on the apparatus 0:appara 0:tus the team then retired to the applause of the audience which 
 was very gratifying in its intensity a display of chair gymnastics was also given by eight picked men from the 
 above squad it consisted of many intricate movements 0:move 0:ments done from ordinary kitchen chairs and with a good deal 
 of tumbling and ground work thrown in made a very effective performance 0:per 0:formance that was much appreciated by the 
 audience 000 0:000 there was one very amusing incident at the tournament and that was during the opening performance of 
 the hampstead heath highway robbery scene after a remarkable exhibition of musical fan fares on the part of the horn

 55 disillusionment by corioral l c o morrison r l c l i it was an idoal summer s day 
 the place a picturesque sleepy country farm by a silver mirrored stream sat a man and a maid the maid 
 was leaning against a tree her left arm round her companion s shoulder her eyes were half closed there was 
 a happy smile upon her face telia stropki was in love the man appeared less illusioned he stared dismally out 
 to where a swarm of flies danced around a piece of orange peel lodged behind a half submerged stone there 
 was a pathetic martyred look in his sad eyes his arms were folded loosely before 0:be 0:fore him in a 
 gesture of resignation and lance corporal butts felt as lugubrious as his attitude suggested he was turning 0:turn 0:ing over 
 in his mind the events of the last few days of course he had never intended seriously to encourage the 
 girl she should have known better a soldier on furlough in a one horse town lonely well surely she should 
 have understood he gave her a quick surreptitious glance impossible he would have to tell her the truth but how 
 there came the difficulty hellj why had he taken so much of farmer stropki s home brew last night and 
 after the party there had been such a gloriously full moon the sky was a bejewelled canopy of twinkling stars 
 romance j he had been drunk had kissed her and she him and now the damage was done and she 
 had fallen for him so badly so much for an attractive uniform why the devil hadn t she read some 
 of those post war books she was so unsophisticated of course he cared a little for her but she was 
 far top fat and he didn t like her eyes they were far too small and green her nose was 
 much too long and her chin aggressive if ever he married her but why contemplate that the possibility was too 
 remote besides there were no vacancies on the married strength darn it all why had he been so foolish but 
 how could he tell her he hated the thought of hurting her he would not be able to stand the 
 look of reproach in her green eyes the whole affair was unfortunate he buried hie face in his hands and 
 moaned softly tired darling telia was so considerate 
 56 a little he replied she was too much in love to note the weariness in his voice w why 
 don t you have a little sleep she said you ll be quite comfortable hc r not a bad idea 
 thought the lance corporal perhaps when he awoke feeling refreshed he d be in a better condition to tackle this 
 problem but supposing he started to a sudden smile flittered across his face what a brain wave yet dare he 
 do it it would require some very clever acting anyhow 0:any 0:how it would be the easiest w y out 
 better to disillusion her that way it would be the kindest in the long run yes he would do it 
 it ould offend her sensitive soul but often it was kind to be cruel thanks telia he said i think 
 i will have a little sleep she smiled lay your head on my lap by a series of wriggles he 
 contrived to worm himself into the invited position close your eyes dear telia laid a fat finger to her lips 
 and pressed it against his lance corporal butts shuddered he must disillusion her this farce could not possibly go on 
 for several minutes he remained inert breathing softly then very slowly he began to snore deliberately it had a crescendo 
 and diminuendo effect he began with a soft rumbling noise at the back of the throat it was a horrible 
 noise tho exhalation was worse this proved to be a long drawn out whistle shrill and nerve racking he could 
 barely refrain from laughing only sheer will power prevented him he felt sure telia would not be able to tolerate 
 that for long this horrible noise must disillusion hor disillusion her irrevocably no carefully nurtured girl like telia could marry 
 a man who snored so terribly it was unthinkable yet she gave no indication of protesting he felt rather chagrined 
 hat was the matter with the girl he resumed his snoring only with more intensity heavens would she never protest 
 h d she no feelings hat was the matter with her if his unconscious snore had provoked the ire of 
 his comrades in the barrack room most of them seasoned old warriors surely this deliberately determined effort must prove intolerable 
 to tolla perhaps he hadn t been forceful enough he would double the volume she would be bound to wake 
 him presently tell him in that peculiar voice of hers that he was snoring this time the low rumbling noise 
 at the back of his throat resembled almost the noise of a farm yard even the cows on the opposite 
 side of the stream ceased their grazing and stared continued on page 64

 60 the 0 d e s s v mk ii or how the machine gun platoon went from here to 
 there and vice versa an explanation not an excuse in the book of things that are to be it was 
 written among many matters of equal import that certain servants of the king should walk upon their feet for a 
 prescribed distance to wit from there to here also many and several details relating to their conduct whilst so employed 
 and these servants did get themselves into the king s great ships and thus did they go from here to 
 there that they might not be too fatigued to perform the king s commands but alas i who can foretell 
 the fate of man or say with certainty which path he shall follow truly has it been said that one 
 man in his time shall play many parts and not always that one for which he hath been cast eor 
 even as the certain servants of the king had completed their preliminary tasks and even as they were preparing themselves 
 0:them 0:selves to walk upon their feet from there to here as they had been directed there came across the 
 king s land a host of djinns and evil spirits who wrought grievous harm to the lands of the king 
 by going secretly through the king s fair forests and plunging their evil flaming breath into the roots of the 
 tallest of the king s trees and the most luxurious of the king s undergrowth now indeed was the king 
 angry he did command divers of his servants as many as were gathered about him to fare forth into the 
 forest and smite the djinns and evil spirits as best they blight and he armed them with many weapons both 
 axes and pick axes and mattocks as well as shovels and bill hooks in great number but the djinns and 
 evil spirits were exceeding many and of a great and persevering perversity and in his wrath the king cried i 
 will have me more servants that i may now and for all time smite down and conquer these evil ones 
 i and lo word of this did come even unto certain of those servants who were preparing to walk from 
 there to here as they had been commanded and these took counsel among themselves and said alasi our feet are 
 too tardy and slow of movement to bring us unto the king in his hour of needl we shall have 
 unto us a chariot and they gat them a great chariot drawn by many hundreds 
 61 of horsepowers and speedily were they drawn from there to here yea with greater speed of motion than they 
 could have attained walking upon their feet and they did fare forth into the forest and take up the strange 
 weapons provided for them and they did battle against the evil ones until the day when they could come before 
 the king and say unto him lol and behold the djinns are conquered 0:conquer 0:ed and smitten down ode to

 62 august 26th 26th 1918 tho success of the british at amiens earlier in august brought within range an advance 
 to the hinderiburg line with st qucntin oambrai as the strategic objective attacks were accordingly instituted along the whole british 
 front with the above object in view on august 26th the operations were widened out to tho north this new 
 advance was to drive the enemy from the high ground east of arras clear the whole arras albert railway 0:rail 
 0:way line and threaten cambrai the beginning of the battle was most auspicious zero hour was 3 00 a m 
 august 26th and by 7 00 a m the bth brigade had reached its first objective east of monchy le 
 preux and the 7th bde coming up behind it was ordered to pass through the r c r and p 
 p c l i were in the attacking lino with half of the 42nd bn forming a guard to the 
 left flank of the bde the patricia s were to attackthe trenches running north from monohy to the village of 
 pelves on the scapre and then across the undulating 0:un 0:dulating country to jig saw wood and the trenches beyond 
 progress at first r as quite easy but on reaching faction friction trenches they found the enemy was holding these 
 in strength while from the village of pelves the whole of our position was enfiladed with dense machine gun fire 
 captain white sent up from bn h q to re organize the firing line owing to heavy casualties among officers 
 there reported 0:re 0:ported that progress was slow owing chiefly to the heavy enemy machine gun fire from both front 
 and flank two tanks which were in support to the regiment were called on to crush out these machine gun 
 nests but were both hit before reaching the line held by the infantry all that their drivers could do was 
 dismount their guns and work them alongside our men getting as far forward as possible the patricia s now found 
 themselves enfiladed from both flanks for they had gotten ahead of the units on either side on the left capt 
 tonßroeko got all of no 2 coy into faction trench but was unable to pross further forward without flank and 
 artillery support and had to content himself with constructing barricades against counter attacks on the right conditions were even worse 
 capt white reported that he had found remnants of 1 3 and 4 coys on the right very confused major 
 macpherson and 
 63 lieuts gammell and biddulph were dead and the right of the line was being held together by the bravery 
 and coolness of a platoon sergeant incessant machine gun fire from cartridge and stokes trenches was causing very heavy casualties 
 indeed and the germans were also very strong and active about the spur at the right during the whole afternoon 
 and evening the regiment was under intense fire in a thoroughly unsound position casualties were heavy and the support companies 
 were soon absorbed 0:ab 0:sorbed into the firing line a platoon at a time the enerrry counter attacked between 6 
 30 and 7 00 in the full force of two battalions and had they got to grips it would have 
 gone hardly with the thin and exhausted line fortunately word was gotten through to the canadian gunners whose co operation 
 and support with the infantry had been splendid all day and although the weather made contact aeroplane work almost impossible 
 their shells smashed down on the enemy concentrations especially in jig saw wood in front of the patricia s r 
 and broke up the attack before it got properly under way not a german soldier reached the canadian trenches through 
 the night the enemy sent at least five bombing attacks in force against no 2 company which were beaten off 
 with heavy casualties and morning found us still in possession of the previous day s gains on the 27th two 
 bombing parties of the patricia s tried to reach pelves working up friction and grenade trenches however they found the 
 position too solidly held and were eventually forced to retire when their store of bombs ran out after inflicting heavy 
 loss on the defenders during the night 27 28 the british guns bombarded pelves and by morning the germans had 
 begun their withdrawal on the morning of the 28th the patricia s were ordered to advance 0:ad 0:vance on jig 
 saw wood a sniping patrol under lieut lopston moved along stokes trench for about 500 yards and then overland to 
 a point on haversack lane which gave a good field of fire into 0:in 0:to jig saw wood there was 
 an exciting race for this post between 0:be 0:tween the p p c l i scouts and a party of 
 ten or twelve germans who were making for the same spot lieut lopston s party won the race by 100 
 yards and after a very sharp little encounter drove the germans off with loss a runner was sent back to 
 capt tenßroeke and under very heavy fire a lewis gun was brought up to man the post the patrol now 
 moved forward and reported massing of germans in jig saw valley nov however the main body of the patricia s 
 came up and united their lewis ms with the artillery to make the valley a death trap for the germans 
 concentrating there at 11 00 a m orders came for the patricia s to advance and capture jig saw wood
