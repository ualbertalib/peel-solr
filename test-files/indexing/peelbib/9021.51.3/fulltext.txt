 trek from utah to cardston from being an empty and uncharted leaving logan utah card and his party wilderness while
 many immigrants came travelled to helena montana from there from the east others followed well they went to the sun
 river country where established north south trails from montana they picked up the riplinger road this one of these was
 the canadian mission trail started from sun river and ran north ‘ 0 as the mormons termed their effort to
 to the blackfoot agency which was located establish a settlement in southern alberta on badger creek it then continued north
 which began in logan utah there of robare on birch creek to emigrant or charles ora card received encouragement immigration
 gap on the international from church president john taylor to seek border from there it proceeded on to refuge in
 canada from the persecution of standoff and fort macleod passing only federal marshals in utah as a british one and
 a half miles to the east of the subject and former resident of eastern present town of cardston canada taylor
 believed that the members of the church would find the canadian evidence that the first mormon company oovernment to be
 much more tolerant of travelled the riplinger road rather than the b charles ora card leader of the their rehioious
 practices than had the whoop up trail comes from several expedition from utah to goven ment of the united states
 at that sources during the golden jubilee of the canada the town of cardston time united states legislation prohibited the
 trek celebrated in 1937 fred shaw a was named in his honour church s practice of plural marriage feeling member
 of the north west mounted police that this was infringement upon their from 1878 until 1883 later a rancher in
 the religion the mormons challenged the cardston area stated constitutionality of the law and practised civil disobedience repeated arrests forced
 don t confuse the whiskey gap trail with many mormons to go into hiding moving the mormon trail the card
 company from one place to another to avoid arrest came through what was known as rather than live in this
 manner many fled to immigration gap that was south lwestl of mexico where they could practice plural whiskey gap i
 think too you should marriage in peace understand that there were two benton trails one often reads of the benton
 trail card accepted his leader s direction and well there was an upper and a lower organized an exploration party
 into what is benton trail cardston was on the upper now british columbia and alberta after benton trail and lethbridge
 on the lower many weeks of travel he determined that benton trail the area near the present cardston was an
 appropriate site for his proposed settlement the upper benton trail was the riplinger when he returned to utah he organized
 a road and the lower benton trail was the pioneer company to establish a colony whoop up trail a comparison
 of the although the achievements of this group names of the rivers streams towns and have been well documented a
 detailed places along the riphinger road in northern description of their route has not montana to the names mentioned in
 the alberta history summer 2003 diaries and personal histories of members details old township maps drawn on a of the
 1887 mormon pioneer company much smaller scale also proved useful demonstrates that they followed the riplinger road through northern montana
 the riplinger road was marked on the township maps but was labelled as the it appears logical that if the
 pioneers were trail from macleod to the u s border travelling on this road in northern montana a careful comparison
 of the route of the they would continue to travel on the same riplinger road as marked on george route
 in southern alberta this is dawson s 1884 survey and the 1910 especially reasonable given the fact that the alberta
 sectional survey map to the route riplinger road passed only a short distance of the trail shown on the township
 maps as to the east of the present site of cardston the trail from macleod to the u s in
 support of this the lethbridge sheet of border indicates the trails were one and the 1910 alberta sectional survey map
 the same shows the route of the riplinger trail and a lesser used trail branch running west there are a
 number of pioneer accounts toward the town of cardston that describe the three day trek from the international boundary to
 present day a review of the journals of selected cardston the journey took them across mormon pioneers indicates that they
 were willow creek and the st mary s river following an existing chart or map for before finally reaching lee

 that exiles for our religion we drove north as these or similar maps were available to far as willow creek

 important because thursday june 2 1887 although it over the years much of the original trail has stormed nearly all
 the forenoon it cleared been ploughed under or lost to road up about noon and we went to work and
 construction it would have been difficult to made our boat preparatory to crossing identify the route used by card s
 party the st mary s on the morrow tonight we without the aid of these maps because the had a
 sharp frost i should here relate we scale in which the survey maps were drawn held a fast day and

 comments of charles card jane site to comniernonate the entry of the bates and mary lula woolf ibe that mormon
 pionee into canada 2 willow creek was close to the border unfortunately oven the years vandals and both card and
 bates state that the wagon harsh weather eroded this monument company drove north as far as the creek making it
 necessary to replace it in i 987 and made camp ibey indicated that a with a modern one located at
 the side of a storm forced the pioneers to stop at the nearby piilih ic road 2 creek early in
 the day a 1901 township it was near willow creek rohph creek that weather conditions forced card and his ‘
 small company of pioneers to make camp zina card wife of charles card states that a member of the north
 west mounted ‘ gl police piloted their group across the st mary s river 2 jane bates remembered that it
 was sergeant brimner that met the pioneer company as they travelled to the st mary s river and then helped
 them cross the swollen stream 25 mary ibey noted that two north west mounted police men rode into their camp
 on willow creek jonathon e layne stated that they crossed the st mary s river near a police detachment archive
 research confirms the existence of the old north west mounted police post on the st mary s river 26 an
 1896 map shows the trail from macleod to the u s border among the early settlers at map shows the
 riplinger road crossing a or the riplinger road passing on the south cardston were these three small creek named rolph
 creek side of a north west mounted police patriarchs seen here about approximately three miles north of the quarter section
 27 this site is seven miles 1900 left to right are john a border evidence of an old trail can
 still be northwest of where the pioneers were woolf henry l hinman and seen in this area in the form
 of wagon ruts camped on willow or rohph creek the charles ora card entering and heaving the creek wolsey current
 landowner guy bowlby described provided this insight the traditional site of the police barracks as being located a few hundred
 yards west of willow creek as it used to be known is his home 2 fred shaw remembered just a
 couple of kihometres north of my house the official name of that creek is there was a mounted police detachment
 rolph creek when i was growing up on the st mary s where the upper everyone used to call this
 creek willow benton trail crossed the river the creek because of the willows that used to detachment was just above
 the old pilling grow in the creek bottom the house four miles southeast of government changed its name to rolph
 cardston the old detachment was creek in honour of some men by that flooded out in 1888 and a new
 one was name that used to farm near the creek i built on the east side of the river don
 t know why the government did that willow creek was a much better name the satellite readings for the old
 trail the trail is pretty visible both leading in visible just south of the bowlby home were and running out
 of willow creek compared to the map coordinates showing i grew up seeing those old wagon ruts of the location
 of the riplinger road in a the original trail almost every day of my contemporary setting these measures early life
 my father told me many times support the conclusion that the old wagon that they were part of the original
 pioneer ruts still visible south of bowlby s home trail the one charles 0 card travelled are likely part of
 the original pioneer trail over and i do not doubt the testimony of and that the traditional site of the
 police my father 23 post is reasonably accurate 3 fl alberta history summer 2003 jonathon e layne described the place
 reported that a miracle occurred according where the pioneers crossed the st mary s to jane ehiza bates and mary
 ibey the river river as deep and dangerous due to the was too high to cross card had been spring
 run off jane bates recalled this advised that it would be weeks before crossing anyone could cross the river safely
 both bates and ibey indicate that the pioneers the wagon boxes were tied down so they fasted and prayed that
 they could safely could not float away even so the water cross the river and arrive at their ran in
 soaking everything with the destination at lee s creek in a timely sergeant piloting the way several trips manner they
 felt that their prayers had were made double team each time been answered when the river dropped crossing and recrossing
 until the seven enough to allow them to cross over safely wagons were safely across as well as the stock
 and drivers the crossing had been after crossing the river the pioneer accomplished in four hours 2 company travelled north
 westerly toward the lee s creek area the brethren of the long time resident and local historian east cardston hutterite
 colony currently forest jensen observed the following own much of the land where the pioneers relative to possible crossing sites
 travelled after the crossing peter hofer cattle and range manager for the colony when i was growing up there were
 three commented on the evidence of old trails or four places where people commonly that still exist on land west
 of the river forded the river one was located directly directly across from the original site of the east of
 aetna near the place where lithe old north west mounted police post tanner family had their first home another was
 located on the south end of there is an old wagon trail in the river the quarter where the old
 north west bottom down by the old pilling place you mounted police detachment used to stand across the river from
 the old can see this trail just to the east of a more pilling home and there was one more
 recent vehicle path there are several located further north i am not sure which places where old wagon ruts come
 out of one of those fords the pioneers used 22 the river and head north there must have been more
 than one place where people the 50 th anniversary of the guy bowlhy contributed this insight used to cross in
 that area the trail runs arrival of the mormons in north as it climbs up out of the river canada
 was celebrated by this the quarter on which the old north west bottom then switches back to the south up
 parade in cardston in 1937 mounted police post used to be on is literally crisscrossed with old wagon trails it
 must have been a very busy place there are lots of tracks in ‘ ‘ different places leading to the
 river but some of the most pronounced are located near the south end of that quarter by the number and
 depth of the wagon ruts in that area i think the pioneers crossed the river on the south side of
 the quarter i owned by the north west mounted police there is a good place to ford the river there

 the exact to the original lee s creek 1887 camp route the pioneers followed during the final here the mormon
 pioneers ended their leg of their journey it is well known that journey and established their settlement they camped on
 the east side of lee s from the information presented in this creek when they arrived in what would paper
 it is now possible to retrace the mosi later become the cardston townsite in fact likely route of the mormon
 pioneers there used to be a small stone monument through northern montana to the marking the place where the pioneers
 first international boundary and on to their final camped according to town historian campsite at lee s creek the authors
 hope willis pitcher that this work will encourage increased interest in this important pioneer this cairn was located on the
 east side trail of lee s creek near the main office of sage industries the creek has changed course since
 the monument was erected dr wright and dr dorius are if the cairn was still standing it would professors of

 his young charges by close ties of blood and race combined with the highest education and culture of one of

 carpentering is the only trade taught but the excellence of the finish and appearance of the buildings now in course
 of completion for blacksmith and shoemaking shops the work being done by the boys under the supervision of the carpenter

 pupils in taking advantage of their opportunities the school building is finely situated on a commanding position overlooking the red
