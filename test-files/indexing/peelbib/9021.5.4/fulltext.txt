 when the alberta farmers association and the canadian society of equity decided to unite in january 1909 the new farm
 body which thus appeared on the alberta agricultural scene was a climax to the organizing efforts of edmonton district farmers
 over a period of thirty years heretofore the western origins of the united farmers of alberta have been credited to
 the territorial grain growers association founded at indian head late in 1901 but closer examination of territorial events before the
 turn of the century reveals that the story goes back to 1879 it is indeed with the work of the
 edmonton agricultural society and the publicity accorded this nascent farm movement by the edtnonton bulletin that one finds a more
 historically reliable starting point for an account of the alberta antecedents of the u f a it is however not
 because the ed if it had not been for frank oliver monton district had the honor of holding the pioneering
 publisher of the edmonton the first agricultural exhibition in the bulletin little or no record of the first north west
 nor because the edmonton stirrings of territorial agricultural ac agricultural society was the first ever tivity would be available today
 even organized in the north west 2 that the though the minute books of the edmoñnucleus 0:edmonnucleus of the u f
 a is depicted here as ton agricultural society do not seem to being found in what is now the capital
 have been preserved one has but to turn of the province such a conclusion is to the files of the
 bulletin for detailed based instead on the definite and suc accounts of the individuals and events cessive links in membership
 which are associated with the growth of the society discovered when one examines the exe during the 1880 s and
 the 1890 s since cutive lists of the edmonton agricultural the bulletin under oliver s direction made society the strathcona
 branches of the such a special point of publicizing the territorial grain growers association growing agricultural activities in the and
 of the alberta farmers association edmonton area it is possible to note the alberta branch of the society of several
 prominent names in the work of equity and finally of course the u f a the local agricultural society which
 keep itself these links go back to the early recurring as the farm movement in 1880 s not long after
 the edmonton northern alberta broadened in scope agricultural society was re organized in from the humble beginnings of 1879 if
 response to the editorial promptings of more complete membership lists were frank oliver but they become much available it is
 likely that an even larger more numerous in the later 1890 s par number of similar links between the ticularly
 with the organization in 1894 early farm groups in alberta would be of the south edmonton or strathcona established agricultural
 society such other off despite the pioneer work of frank shoots from the parent body during the oliver and the

 mounted policeman gets snow blind and is lost a horse s instinct saves his life chas parker a member of
 the north west mounted police stationed at macleod started from standoff for the st mary river with despatches during the
 late storm after travelling some distance he became snow blind and lost his way and had been out five days
 and nights without anything to eat when he was found by the stage driven en route to macleod from fort
 benton the particulars as given us by mr hugh munroe a passenger on the coach are much as follows they
 found him sitting on his horse in an almost unconscious state about sixteen miles this side of milk river on
 the benton trail he did not seem to care where he went or what became of him they took him
 from his horse but after he sat still a few moments he could not move when he saw a loaf
 of bread he thought he could eat ten of them but was unable to touch a small piece of it
 the horse showed itself almost human he had no lariat to tie him with but when he would lie down
 in the snow at night the horse would stand near him all night occasionally coming up to him and licking
 his face in the morning he would come to him to be saddled this horse kept going with him until
 he struck the trail when he stopped short and then turned and followed the trail until he met the macleod
 coach parker said that at one time he felt so desperate that if he had had a piece of paper
 and pencil to explain his action he would have shot himself his first thought on returning to consciousness was his
 duty wondering how he could get the dispatches which he had saved to their destination constable parker is from toronto
 and is a son of the auditor of the credit valley railway he has had a pretty tough experience and
 we are truly rejoiced to be able to record his almost miraculous escape from the very jaws of a terrible
 death we understand that he is improving and we trust that very shortly he will have entirely recovered fortunately the
 weather was not very cold or he would undoubtedly have perished as he had on light clothing and only a
 felt hat parker was brought in from whoop up yesterday and is now in the hospital here under dr deveber
 s care who will no doubt soon bring him round mr munroe then went on to say that these reports
 which go east of freezing etc in this country give people an idea that it is a terrible country to
 come to but said that he had travelled across the prairie for sixteen days in the same storm and had
 not felt the cold as much as in ontario or even california winter travelling in any country would be anything
 but pleasant where the distances in some instances between houses reach up into the hundreds of miles fort macleod gazette

 although understanding very little of this language i have held short conversations with crees and sarcees who have grasped intelligently
 the thoughts presented many of the signs are closely allied to the deaf mute sign language a young man whom
 i met who was deaf and dumb showed me several signs which were similar and others where the difference was
 very slight a friend of mine whom i wished to call was nearly a mile distant and consequently beyond the
 reach of my voice being much perplexed i turned to an indian and told him my difficulty and he observing
 another indian beyond the person desired made signs to him which were effectual as he went up to the man
 and told him that he was to return which he did such is the utility of this indian form of

 for oil for years past reports have been spread from time to time regarding the presence of asphalt and petroleum
 tar in the country surrounding edmonton and a good deal of time and money has been expended in the hitherto
 vain effort to locate the actual springs indian stories were told of springs of black mud here and there but
 none of these stories could ever be traced up to actual fact the indian who knew the place was dead
 or the one who had heard of it was unable to find it or the spring having been found it
 was only black mud not the wished for petroleum color was lent to these reports by the known facts regarding
 the vast petroleum deposits on the athabasca which might easily extend to underlie the edmonton district by the fact that
 limestone boulders saturated with petroleum tar in a hard dry state were frequently found on the river bars and by
 the further facts that in the valley of a creek about 60 miles south west of edmonton large boulders or
 broken pieces of sandstone saturated with tar were found and a similar find was made at pigeon lake the weak
 point of these discoveries was that although beyond question the tar was there being only in loose moveable pieces of
 stone no clue was given as to the locality of the spring from which it came a local company was
 formed to bore for oil at the creek mentioned but the drill procured was unsuited for the purpose and soon
 broke and the boring was abandoned this was the last attempt that was made to find oil until monday of
 this week rumors had been gathering ever since spring opened as to the existence of a most peculiar spring north
 of st albert and on monday last p daly drove out to the place about 22 miles distant to investigate
 on his return he brought with him a number of pieces of earth or mud saturated with tar so as
 to be quite flexible and a pan full of the tar itself in a semi liquid state taken out of
 a hole which he caused to be dug to a depth ci about five feet apparently the tar had exuded
 through a crack in the ground saturating the surface earth and being itself hardened by the process about two feet
 below the surface the first pure liquid tar was found in what appeared like pockets as far as the digging
 was carried the color of the tar is black with a very slight brownish tingle it is of the consistency
 and has very much of the smell of ordinary coal tar in every way it exactly resembles the tar found
 on the athabasca which has been pronounced by geologists to be the product of petroleum beds the tar burns readily
 in a fire giving off smoke and a smell exactly like petroleum whether or not the tar is a sure
 indication of a profitable petroleum field there is no doubt of the genuineness of the find and as little that
 is it is not confined to that single locality edmonton bulletin june 16 1892 ukrainian pioneers in western canada by
 p j lazarowich the first ukrainian immigrants to come to canada of whom we have official record were two peasants
 ivan pillpiwski and wasyl eleniak who arrived in montreal on the ship oregon on the 7 th of september 1891
 they had come from a small ukrainian village of nebiliw in galicia which was then part of the austrian monarchy
 settlement at gretna just south of winnipeg about which pilipiwski had heard from some german friends at home when they
 arrived there they were so impressed with the progress and general well being of this community that they decided to
 bring their families over as soon as possible and settle there pillpiwski went back late in the spring of 1892
 but eleniak decided to hire out locally as a farm hand until he made enough money to go back for
 his own family pilipiwski s report of what he saw in canada created a sensation not only in his own
 village but in the neighboring villages as well landless when they landed on canadian soil they had between them some
 240 at montreal they took the train for winnipeg which was their i r s t destination they had come
 to investigate reports which they had heard about the v a s i uninhabited stretches of fertile land in western
 impoverished and illiterate peasants thrilled at the prospect of a better and happier life if not for themselves then for
 their children as a result late in the summer of 1892 twelve families from pilipiwski s village actually sold their
 property and emigrated to canada two or three families remained in manitoba but the others went on further west and
 settled in alberta in the area north of lamont and bruderheim where they formed the nucleus of a large block
 of ukrainian settlers in alberta the children and grandchildren of these original pioneers live and farm in that area to
 canada to encourage settlers from other countries the government was offering 160 acres of this land to every male adult
 for a nominal filing fe 9 of 10 to pilipiwski and eleniak each of whom possessed only four or five
 acres of tired unproductive land such reports stirred great hopes in their hearts they therefore decided to find out the
 truth for themselves pilipiwski possessed better than elementary education but eleniak could barely read and write this day for pilipiwski
 his return home resulted in an unhappy episode in his long and ci d v e n t urous life
 shortly after his arrival the number of people in the surrounding area who decided to emigrate to canada grew to
 such proportions that the austrian authorities became after a stay in winnipeg then a small western town they decided to
 travel further west into saskatchewan and alberta in the course of the next few months they visited the area around
 yorkton saskatchewan and then went west and south as far as calgary but they were not impressed with what they
 saw and returned to winnipeg from there they travelled to a small german alarmed and took stern measures to halt
 temporarily closed the door to all further the exodus as a result pilipiwski was immigration arrested on a charge of
 sedition he was tried convicted and sentenced to between the first and the second world one month in prison but

 first world war philip konowal won premier douglas campbell of manithe victoria cross toba writing on the occasion of the
 60 th anniversary of the arrival of the first ukrainians in canada said in part space does not allow me
 to discuss any other fields of endeavour in which the ukrainian canadians have played or are playing important parts i
 must for instance omit such a vital calling as the teaching profession because to do it justice would require a
 separate paper such activities as the various branches of athletics or sports in which the ukrainians have many national figures
 such artistic pursuits as drama art folk dancing folk music arts and handicrafts and several others in all these pursuits
 or activities the ukrainian canadians are contributing something to our developing canadian national culture the ukrainians came to this country
 to seek freedom in return for the freedom they found they have bequeathed to us their own distinctive culture they
 have assisted in the development of our province and have done much to bring prosperity to manitoba their sons and
 daughters are now bringing us fame in many fields including those of music and scholarships manitoba is proud of her
 ukrainians and the contribution they are making to the business and public life of the province in conclusion may i
 quote a few paragraphs from statements made by distinguished canadians of non ukrainian origin describing the achievements of ukrainian canadians
 and their contribution to the material and culture welfare of our country particularly the west prof g w simpson head
 of the department of history university of saskatchewan speaking before the first ukrainian canadian congress in winnipeg in june 1943
 on the subject the cultural task of our generation made these observations the ukrainian people he said have a distinctive
 cultural tradition he then enumerated four different forms or aspects of this tradition namely deep religious faith language and literature
 the tradition of music and especially folk music and lastly arts and handicrafts besides bringing their sturdy hands the ukrainian
 sons of the soil brought a colorful culture which has become familiar to many albertans above is a ukrainian dance
 demonstrated in edmonton about eight years ago this photo is from the edmonton bulletin photographic collection preserved by the gle
 bow foundation calgary in september 1951 speaking in win of the soil a static and conservative factor nipeg at a
 banquet concluding the in our dynamic society folk culture a vital source for the arts in music painting letters 60
 th anniversary celebrations of the and the dance passion for freedom by ukrainians in manitoba prof w l mor which
 the democratic faith of this country ton of the department of history univer has been revived and renewed devotion to
 sity of manitoba gave an address on culture by which the cultivation of learning and the arts has been refreshed
 and the topic the common heritage he strengthened it is a great accession to the concluded his address with this
 eloquent common store of which ukrainian canapassage dians may be proud and for which all in entering into the common
 heritage canadians are grateful it lies with us all the ukrainian pioneers brought much love then to develop this common
 heritage fire at fort macleod on the morning of the 5 th dec 1880 the western row of buildings of
 the police fort occupied as stables was entirely destroyed by fire which accidentally caught in the harness room adjoining the
 stables in about two hours the entire row of buildings was in ruins and had there been a high wind
 blowing at the time the whole fort must have gone up in smoke the quartermaster s storehouse caught fire but
 through the extraordinary exertions of captain c ebenezer denny and his force of policemen the building was saved a few
 of the citizens of this place were on hand and aided materially in saving adjoining buildings from destruction corporal patterson
 won glory and a reward of 40 for the excellent manner in which he handled the babcock extinguisher when the
 alarm was given patterson made a rush for the extinguisher and slinging it upon his back charged across the parade
 grounds bucking harder than a three year old broncho in order to mix the contents so that there would be
 sufficient gas generated to make the machine work with all its force when he reached the burning buildings he pointed
 the hose properly turned the cock and ‘ whiz no he didn t ‘ whiz worth a cent as he
 had forgotten to fill the machine with water consequently there was no gas generated but he got the reward all
 the same for his good intentions except the loss of the buildings there was no property of any value destroyed
 as the horses were all gotten out in time to save them from the flames and there were a good
 many valuable animals in the stables when the fire broke out at noon yesterday capt denny had his men paraded
 and made a short but appropriate speech to them thanking them for the noble work they had done in preventing
 the fire from spreading today he issued the following address to the citizens which speaks for itself to the citizens
 of fort mac 1 e d gentlemen allow me to thank you for the kind assistance you rendered me and
 my men on the occasion of the fire in the fort and for your valuable exertions in aiding to prevent
 it spreading it was first my intention to have convened a public meeting at which i could have thanked you
 personally but thinking that owing to business it might be inconvenient for you to attend i beg in this letter
 to express to you through mr davis how highly i appreciate your kindness c ebenezer denny fromn the river press
