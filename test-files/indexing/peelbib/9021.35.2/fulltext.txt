 1929 he set up a studio in cal in the light of two parallel developments in his gary and began
 work as a fulltime artist life the first may be found in his several interests then the depr ession hit
 a year later another not connected with painting and the second in exhibition of pastels drew much more praise than
 the canvases he did for himself and the future sa les down but not out gissing put his career together
 they provided the raison d etre for his on hold and headed back to the ghost river to commercial orientation
 find ajob and re think his life though convinced versatility was very important to gissing and that his future was
 as an artist he had reserva was probably associated with his romantic desire tions about the saleability of pastels his
 decision to actualize dreams he once remarked that he ranching and ranch life ssere favourite themes of gissing during the
 early period of his career ‘ i his s ater c i is entitled line camp 4 could never be
 single minded about art or anything else for that matter his restless spirit sought fulfilment in a variety of endeavours
 his painting was thus sandwiched between building tasks spinning and weaving writing poetry and short stories designing and inventing and
 most of all his model trains just like his painting which attempted to preserve nature on canvas gissing actualized his
 romantic love of tr ains by reproducing them in minature his ghost river railroad featured an outdoor elevated track on
 which he ran his beautifully hand crafted carriages pulled by powerful steam driven locomotives that were exact replicas of operational
 models what is so remarkable is not the extent of gissing s model rail system but the fact that he
 built it all himself from the locomotive whistles to the very moulds to cast the intricate engine components more than
 anything else gissing s model trains exemplified the practical lengths he was prepared to go in order to realize a
 dream roland gissing there can be little doubt that gissing faced a years he enjoyed a small circle of compatible
 dilemma with his painting during this period his friends and the variety of endeavour he craved appreciation of the public
 taste led him to produce and needed his saleable paintings had given him paintings that sold well but which were
 incon both renown and a good livelihood while his prisistent with his personal fulfilment as an artist vate collection preserved
 his individuality and clearly the compromise upset him greatly and hopefully guaranteed his future place as an artist though he
 was convinced that he had to cater to things were going so well that one wonders about the market place
 until he had made his name he the course of gissing s career had he been able was not prepared
 to sacrifice his own inner need to preserve the harmonious world he had built for for artistic self expression thus
 over the years himself between 1935 and 1944 he built up a private collection of paintings which on march 3
 1944 a fire in gissing s studio he hoped one day to exhibit to the world as the changed the
 course of his life within a few short work of the real roland gissing most of these hours he saw
 his house writings model trains paintings had little of the airy lightness charac and private collection of paintings reduced to
 teristic of his more popular canvases rather they ashes the pragmatist in him quickly rebuilt the were darker more suggestive
 of turbulence and house and tried to renew a familiar lifestyle for characterized by a much subtler use of colour
 the romantic however a life s work had gone up also included in gissing s private collection were in smoke
 and with it the dreams it represented scenes of ranches in southern alberta they gissing never really recovered from this
 tragedy represented his effort to preserve the relics of a for with his creative vistas dimmed the pragmatist bygone era

 growing isolation from the mainstream consciousness among the public generally of new directions and ideas in art he became inbenefitted
 traditional artists like gissing whose creasingly detached from the alberta society of established reputation and picturesque landscapes artists the official
 forum for artistic expression gave his work both credibility and high appeal in the province instead he spent more time
 with he found it difficult to keep pace with demand the group of mostly mateur enthusiasts who made commissions alone

 there were simply too many strikes against him in his own time he was neither for mally trained nor particularly
 well versed profes sionally in art he painted much of the same thing and was seen as too prolific and
 static creatively moreover his style was incompatible with the i contemporary movement towards landscape im i pressionism even his commercial
 success was held suspect since artists of his day generally did not make comfortable livings without sacrificing ‘ i something
 of their vision there remains however one inescapable fact roland gissing s immense popularity should not and cannot be ignored
 time and the perspective it brings will probably work in his favour superior gissing canvases may then be assessed on
 their own merits rather than in the light of their meow patibility with current trends or their association ‘with lesser

 practice of polygamy which i am not aware of discouragement rather than approval of such a ‘ 5 yet exists

 had a letter from a friend in utah this offence if them is any proability of its introdrtction rather than
 we should wait until it has become estab party stated that in some instances the mormons lished in canada 5

 who then was sitting as the migration and the request for the allowance of member for assiniboia east and as
 minister of plural marriages the interior dewdney had been lieutenant simultaneous to the introduction of an anti governor of the
 north west territories from 1881 polygamy bill in the commons was the presenta to 1888 and had had as extensive
 a knowledge of tion of bill f in the senate on feb 4 1890 con mormon activities in alberta as
 anyone in cabiservative senator william john macdonald of net he had a lso been visited by card lyman and british
 columbia introduced an act respecting taylor in the fall of 1888 he commented offences relating to the law of marriage
 and it received speedy first reading sixteen days later i thought it was proper in view of these reports that
 i should through my deputy communicate with the it received second reading and its proponent won leaders of these people
 asking for an explanation mr dered aloud if by having the bill in senate the cant the leader of the
 party was not in the territo liberal government in the commons might be ries at the time the letter reached
 them but another moved to embr ace his legislation gentleman whose name i forget answered the letter and st ated
 most positively that they were not pisictising if there are mormons in the north west territones po lygamy but that
 they were keeping to the solemn wherever they settle they will practice the tenets and promise they had made the
 government on the return customs of their sect it is therefore necessary and of mr card to the colony he
 wrote a second letter wise that we should at once prevent the spread of this these letters have only been
 lately received and i have canker in our country i do not know how many mor not yet placed them
 before my colleagues but are now mons there are in the north west territories or to what in the privy
 council office mr cant st ated still more extent they practice their peculiar customs but it is said strongly than
 the gentleman who had written previously wherever they are they are sure to practice polygamy that these people came here
 for the purpose of obeying i think the best feature of the bill is that which dis our laws and
 were not practising polygamy and he qualifies offenders from being candidates for election invited the strictest and closest investigation to
 serve as members of the house of commons or legislative assembly of the north west territories blake pressed his point
 on the unfitness of morto serve as jurors or to hold any office under the crown mons as law abiding
 settlers he felt that if they or any public or municipal office in the north west wer e in difficulty
 with the american authorities territories it will be one of the chief means of obtaining information and securing conviction under
 the act at over polygamy they would be less likely to lawelection time no doubt those people will take differ
 abiding in canada his questioning of dewdney ent sides and their opponents will find out the weak even evoked a
 response from the prime minister spots of their characters mr blake it is very well understood that the reason with
 that he motion to vote was tgreed to and the mormons left the united states is the difficulty they 12
 have with the american government arising out of the present provision which leaves it in the option of the question
 of polygamy judge to merely impose a nominal fine is an illusory sir john a macdonald no doubt punishment and
 will develop the hope in the breasts mr blake that is a most serious question and when of the mormons
 or others who would seek t evade they object to remaining in another country where the the law that they
 may escape with a fine laws are practically the same as here only perhaps mulock s second point dealt with
 continued less strict it is difficult to underst and why they should cohabitation come here to obey our laws mr
 dewdney i think the bulk of those leaving are under this law i presume if a man is once convicted
 fleeing from justice 2 of having married say a dozen wives and has paid the penalty he will be exempt
 from further liability newspapers interpreted this dtalogue to mean as regards the marriage though he may be reached that dewdney
 practically admitting what mr under the subsequent clause sub section 6 which deals blake had said 22 with the crime
 of continuing to cohabit with two or more women at the same time the exchange between blake and dewdney temporarily
 deflected debate on the proposed mulock wanted assurances that penalties for criminal code amendments proposed by justice contr acting plural
 marriages in canada were stiff minister thompson after blake s final question and that cohabitation with two or more women
 william mulock liberal member for york north irrespective of where the marriages were solemhad two points he wished incorporated into
 the nized also carried a formidable penalty thompson plural marriage prohibitions was quite agreeable i am willing to increase the
 i would just call attention to the plural clause and ask penalty 25 blake then intetjected that prison the government
 whether they consider the proposed sentences be mandatory i think imprisonment penalty is sufficient to meet the evil this is
 not a case ought to be made imperative but thompson of dealing with the evil of bigamy if it were
 the penalty in that case is much more severe than is pro was unmoved vided hem but we are here
 trying to prevent what may blake then returned to questioning dewdney become a serious moral and national ulcer the about

 two days and two nights people to which dewdney replied that it was a to the hamlet in which these
 people live and who i am told expresses the opinion that they are not quite matter of standard procedure to
 respond to corso monogamous now as is represented 27 respondence irrespective of source dewdney responded we have received no three
 members of parliament picked up on the such report yet i have only seen some accounts inducement issue quebec conservative
 william of interviews published in the newspapers 28 bullock ives asked how it was possible to keep the member for
 norfolk north next spoke and the mormons out of canada and wilfrid laurier offered his perceptions on the mormon arrivals
 wondered if communications with the mormons john charlton had little good to say about the new by government officials without
 remonstrances s ttlers in the north west against po lygamy could be misconstrued as tacit encouragement of those practices when
 ed i doubt very much whether the governnicnt would he mund blake interjected that card s wife was one justified
 in view of the experience of the united states in retërence 0:reterence to the momions in ottering any encourage of the
 numerous daughters of brigham young ment to the immigration of those people it has been dewdney replied to ives that

 it is init has kiund them to he thoroughly disloyal to the institutions of the country and it has been

 new brunswick provincial legislature and there are many in idaho and in utah who would be was once pr esident
 of its executive council he was anxious to come here we would probably tind that one of the delegates to
 the 1864 quebec conferwe had a great deal of trouhlc on our hands i do not believe this is a
 desirable class of immigration i must ence and the 1866 london conference which laid admit that utah which i have
 visited twice has been the foundation for national identity in 1867 converted by theni iron wilderness into a cultivated mitchell

 questioned dewdney about reputed incentives given the mor i have listened to the remarks of my hon fnend from west
 durhan mr blake my hon friend from north mons to come to canada in the commons he wellington mr mcmullen
 and my hon friend here wt rned that mr charlton who is always an authority on moral questions and while
 i conimend the government for if they the mormons get a settlement in the north taking care to preserve the
 morals of this country i west they will continue secretly to practice those must differ with those hon gentlemen who
 say we abominations which they are guilty of in other parts should not allow the mormons to come into this
 counof the world and i think it was exceedingly unwise tr y we have a free government we are a
 free people that the slightest inducement should have been held out and any man can come here and demand pemiis
 sion to them to conic into that country it would have been to occupy any unoccupied lands which are set
 apart better if possible to prevent any of them from coming for those people who come into this country to
 settle in there hut if they do come in there they should he here an hon member says we iliust
 draw the line made to understand that the law will be strictly applied somewhere i draw the line at their
 obeying the laws and that it will cwsh out the improprieties which they of the country and if these people
 give their pledge have been guilty of to obey the laws if they state that they will give up their
 polygamous practices and will live in the same dewdney replied that the ‘‘ honorable gentle way as other people do
 i think they deserve consider 14 to foreefully present the case himself sir john a macdonald the hon gentleman blake
 is quite correct that they ought not to get any encouragement as regards the con tinuanee of that peculiar institution
 of their religion which is so objectionable they certainly have received no acquiescence or encouragement with regard to that they
 have received no encouragement even to come to this country at all they came as i understand it from utah
 because they were as they alleged harshly used not only with respect to an attempt to cnforee monogamy but that
 they were harshly used generally and they thought that in the wild west there was a prejudice against them which
 they could not overeome they were oppressed they were not allowed to sit on juries and all that kind of
 thing and therefbre they removed to canada where they could have the protection of our law they caine in of
 their own accord lam personally aware of these circumstances because i have seen them mr card and some others came
 to ottawa some of them are british subjects by birth one or two are canadians by birth and others were
 born in the united states they said they wished to settle in canada they were informed what our law was
 and they were told explicitly and distinctly that we were aware that the great cause of the antipathy towards them
 in the united states was the practice of polygamy and they must understand that the people of canada would be
 firmly opposed to that practice as the people of the united states were they said they were aware of that
 charles ora ard but they wanted shelter from what they considered opation when they are coming here in consequence of
 pression they were told told by myself that in the severe laws which have been passed by our neigh any
 case where the practice was proved they would hors to the south of us it has to be admitted that
 they be punished with the utmost rigor of the law they are first rate settlers that they are industrious and
 fm said they were quite willing to submit to the law they gal and all we should do is to
 see that they obey the attempted of course to argue their case and they dislaws which compel them to live
 as other people do in cussed the doctrines of mormonism generally with me a chnstian community to let them know
 that they will i said to them you must understand that there must have to cany out what they have
 professed and to con be no misunderstanding about it there will be no form to the laws of the land
 in which they are living leniency there will be no looking over this practice if they do that i do
 not think any person should take but as regards your general belief that is a matter bethe ground that they
 should not be allowed to come tween yourselves and your conscience we are glad into this country because they may
 have been mormons to have you in this country so long as you obey the formerly and may have mormon
 inclinations now laws we are glad to have respectable people her long as they do not practice them i quite
 approve of majesty has a good many british subjects who are the provisions of the bill to prevent the difficulties
 that mohammedans and if they came here we would be have existed among our neighbors and i would let these
 obliged to receive them but whether they are mohampersons understand that if they want the pnvilege of medans or mormons
 when they come here they must settling in our country they will have to obey such obey the laws of
 canada i told them this and they laws as this legislature may enact and as long as they professed a
 sincere desire i have no reason to doubt do that i think we ought not to discourage them from their
 sincerity to submit themselves to the laws of coming in canada for the sake of the rest and equity that
 they blake then apologized to mitchell for suggesting thought they would get instead of being surrounded by a turbulent crowd
 who were oppressing them in that the mormons ought to be prevented by legts ever y way 34 lation from
 coming to the north west territories blake s fear was that the mormons might have the prime minister succinctly described
 card s the mistaken notion that they could do in canada visit in 1888 though whether his recollection of what
 they could not do in the united states it was accurate one cannot tell it doesseem that namely pursue the
 theology of plural wives the the subject of allowance of polygamy tn alberta prime minister was aware of blake s
 point and lest was discussed and that mormon initiatives in this any who attended this committee of the whole in
 regard were rebuffed limitations on freedom of the house of commons misinterpret his govern religious practice in canada seem to
 have been ment s firm stand on mormon polygamy he stood the same as in utah with the notable exception

 america 10 subsection one of section four of chapter one application of the canadian law caused some con hundred and
 sixty one of the revised statutes enticern for the members and after the prime minister tied an act respecting offenses
 relating to the law had spoken mulock wonder ed how the law could of marriage is hereby repealed and the

 we cannot be too astute in trying to frame b any kind of conjugal union with more than one a

 to declare what the law is but what c what is among the persons called mormons is steps are we

 way they may be able to defeat the very law we are mormon in canada for violation of the thompson

 are traitors in our midst we have it on unimpeachable authority that there are men in this province who have
 formed themselves into an organization for hindering as far as they can the prosecution of the war two of them
 were located in the travis district wearing buttons on which were inscribed the words no men and no money for
 the war they are without doubt two of a number the button has a white rim and a black face
 on which is the inscription in letters of white white and black betokening the white feather of cowardice and the
 black designs of treachery who are instrumental for this organization and where and by whom were the buttons made such

 home in clyde scotland and we all sounded calling them to divine worship in the seemed as if afraid to
 make a noise one of my dining room br other s picked up his mandolin and began to play during
 the service it seemed as if a great calm softly some of the old hymn tunes the effect settled over
 the ship and then the engines started was ver y depressing as i not feeling any too again when the
 people came out from the service happy at the prospect of our parting the cab the fog had lifted and
 a ship was sighted coming arrived which was to take me to the ship and only from montreal this caused
 great excitement for then did i realize fully the step i was taking not we had now been nine days
 on our voyage across a word was spoken as my mother and i clasped the ocean hands a farewell wave
 of the hand and off i set the sail up the st lawrence was something arriving at the ship s
 side i saw many sad fare to be remembered it was the month of june and wells which only made
 me feel worse i waited everything looked its best the quaint little vilwith my brothers as long as i could
 and then i lages all with their churches with tall spires beautoo had to bid them farewell and go on
 board the tiful trees and the sun shining made it look like ship down in the cabin i found friends
 who like a fai ryland myself were going to join those who had started when we came to quebec we
 were allowed a home they were all having a good cry so i was three hours on shore we did
 not think much of able to give full vent to my feelings one of them the old part of the
 city but felt rewarded for our asked how did my mother take it and when i climb after we saw
 the view from the heights of thought of her sad face as i clasped her hand in abraham we tried
 to do a little shopping but farewell i said if this ship stops at greenock could make no success as
 none of us could speak i m going home but i felt better by that time french we were told
 afterwards that one man had and so i came to canada gone into a cafe and picking up the menu
 and as we sailed down the river clyde and looked pointing out different things said roast beef and on the
 familiar landscape we all wondered what potatoes the waitress startled him by saying we would come through ere we beheld

 soon as catherine arrived in medicine hat in 1905 she married james neil above is their wedding photo we did
 not manage to reach montreal till the all those i knew however i soon found that some next day when
 we got up on deck after breakfast of my fellow train travellers were the same ones we were at the
 wharf and the luggage was being who had crossed the ocean with me unloaded some of us stood watching for
 a short we were all rather amused as we watched the time and i got a surprise when i saw
 a friend come beds being made up as the trains at home were on board ship he had gone to
 canada only a very different but we found we could travel quite month before and had settled at montreal he
 had comfortably except for the bumps when we come to help my friends and i through the customs started away
 from a station travelling in a train and then he would take us to another friend s one soon becomes
 acquainted with one s fellow home passengers and the first question was where it took quite a time before we
 were free to go are you going of course as i was on my way as there was such a
 lot of luggage it was all laid to be married i came in for a lot of teasing out in
 groups with the initial above so it was not we had great fun cooking our meals on the very hard
 to find our belongings i had brought train s little kitchen stove sometimes we had time out a great many
 wedding gifts but the customs to get a meal at a station or else we could buy officer was very
 nice about it he soon made his bread and other eatables marks on my trunks and then we were free
 to go in 17 days from the time i had left my home visiting i arrived at medicine hat after
 spending three after going to see my friend we took a sight nights and days on the train right away
 i was seeing car to tour montreal it seemed to me to told to go and bring my future husband
 to meet be a very busy city the streets were crowded and the people i had travelled west with i
 walked up i thought the ladies walking about looked very gay and down the platform but could see no one
 who in their light summer dresses and large hats the resembled the man i was looking for i began to
 day passed all too quickly and then we had to wonder if four years had changed him so much make
 our way to the station where my train was that i did not know him leaving for the west then
 i noticed that a man was following me quite a number of the passengers from our liner and finally he
 asked mc if i was looking for somecame to see us off as well as our friends and one of
 course i put on my haughtiest air and as i said good bye i felt as if i was really
 leaving walked on but he spoke to me again and told me 19 he was the chief of po lice

 my shoulders to keep me dry when church and by the time i got there i found the i got
 to the hotel i wondered why the men rose minister s wife and a friend ready to stand as witand
 walking to the counter looked at me and then nesses i owe them quite a debt of gratitude for smiled
 i did not know that only indian women they had decked the altar with flowers to make wore shawls and
 to see me with a shawl and a me feel that somebody cared large hat trimmed with flowers must have
 been after the wedding we went to send a cable to a novel sight my mother and then to have
 our picture taken the chief asked the hotel clerk to find me a then i decided to do a little
 shopping i was room and you can imagine how i felt when he amazed at the price of goods compared
 to those said he was sony he did not have one a travel in scotland i wanted a brown betty
 teapot to hold ling show company had come to medicine hat six or seven cups of tea and when i
 asked the and every room was booked the chief asked to price and was told it was 60 cents i
 turned to my see the proprietor and when he told him that i husband and said 2 6 fora 6
 ½ p teapot the had been travelling for 17 days he called the clerk heard me and he happened to
 be a scot so housekeeper who found me a room it had a door he laughed and told me i
 would have to forget leading to another room adjoining but she told the old country and its prices and remember
 that me the key was on my side so i wouldn t be i was in canada disturbed two days
 later we started for grassy lake and the chief had asked me if would require any my future home arriving
 ther e on june 22 nd of my luggage and when i gave him the tags for as i came
 from a large city i had never been those i wanted he had the hotel porter bring them on a
 farm except for a short visit of a week i was up from the station when he arrived he said
 i an only girl and had been r aised by one of those hear you re from the clyde i
 felt that here was reserved scot s mothers who think it time enough someone from the old country so i
 did not feel for a girl to learn things about married life after so much alone they are married always
 in the hope that she most of the help in the hotel at that time were will be at hand
 to tell a young wife all she should chinese i thought they were women as they wore know unfortunately for
 me i was married at gowns and their hair was braided and wound medicine hat so my mother was far
 away round the head medicine hat was a small town in 1905 there that first night was the longest one
 i ever spent were only a few houses on the hill the rest of tired after my long journey in
 a str ange hotel the town was in the valley along the bank of the and no one to meet
 me the chief had told me river it was considered the prettiest town in the that the train from grassy
 lake did not get in till west at that time and looking down from the hill next morning at six
 when morning came i heard on the neatly painted houses it seemed to deserve someone enter the adjoining room and
 strop a the title i fondly imagined that gr assy lake razor and shave i was sure it was my
 fiance and where i was going would be something like it then thought it would be a joke to open
 the door it was three in the morning when the train got and surprise him but on second thought i
 cha nged into grassy lake and i soon discovered there my mind it was a good thing i did as
 i found wasn t even a platform or a depot i found that out later that the man was a
 stranger out when i stepped off the train and landed on i was up and dressed by the time the
 clerk told the ashes at the foot of the railway bed i soon me there was someone to see me
 i went out of picked myself up and made for the conveyance my room and there found jim waiting for
 me he which was to take us to the ranch it wasn t a taxi was as brown as a
 berry with being so much out or a buggy but a lumber wagon driven by my side and the years
 had changed him quite a bit husband s brother when we crossed the double but in manner he was still
 the same as the man set of rails on the track i thought it was a rough who had gone
 to canada fr om scotland four year s road but before i got to my home i was very cer
 2 one of the first sights which greeted catherine on her arrival at the ranch were men shearing sheep this
 is a viess of shearing at the same location a less years later tam it was a very rough road
 the two bottom corners of the sack were tied and the trail leading south from grassy lake was after a
 few bundles of wool had been thrown in cox s trail and after it came out of the coulee a
 man went into the sack and tramped them then it branched off one going south west to cox s more
 were thrown in until the sack was full and and the other going south east to neil s known it
 was sewn at the top lifted with a lever and as neil s trail after we came out of the
 coulee tossed down this went on until all the day s clip my husband asked his brother if he was
 sure we was sacked other men were busy grinding their were on the right trail as it was a very
 dark night shears in readiness for the morrow he said he couldn t tell till we came to the bump
 after the wool was all away the sheep were it came all right and i nearly fell out of the
 dipped using a slough in a coulee the men fixed wagon as the night was very dark i did not
 get a dip there with a long gangway at one side and a view of the landscape after a drive
 of 10 miles two little corrals on the other after the sheep we arrived at my new home then i
 realized i swam through the dip they were put into these was alone in a strange country with no neighbours
 corrals to dry and then were allowed to go someno stores and little experience in cooking or times the sheep
 would stop in front of the dip and housekeeping no amount of coaxing would make them move the sheep were
 being sheared at the time i ar again so that the men had to lug them to the vat nved
 and as the shearing pens were a mile up the and throw them in coulee i was left alone all
 day i felt that my after shearing and dipping and the wool was romance had not ended like most fai
 ry tales and shipped we made preparations for the summer they lived happily ever after rather it looked camping out
 with the sheep as if i were to live alone ever after in the days before i came this was
 an easy job soon after my arrival i walked to where the the tent was put in the wagon along
 with a cook men were shearing as i had never seen anything stove and some grub and any suitable location
 near like that before shearers were paid at the rate of a slough was all right but with a wife
 along a seven and eight cents per head and a good shearer camp wagon had to be built i watched
 it go up could do a hundred in a day after supper was board by board as they nailed them
 to the upover the wool was put into large sacks which held rights on top of a running gear there
 was one between two and three hundred pounds according little window at the back with a shelf for odds to
 how good the packer was a scaffold was niade and ends above at both sides the cook stove was of
 four posts supported by cross beams and stand put in a little cupboard built at one side and then ing
 about 12 feet high the sacks were fixed to we were ready for moving a square l rame fitted on
 the top of the scaffold the team was harnessed and hacked up to the 21 camp wagon but neither horse
 seemed at ease so back i went to show that i could try i got a with such a high
 affair behind it as soon as they tr ap down off its nail and hammered the pin into were hitched
 onto it hey bolted and the beautiful the ground so that the coyote could not take it little home went
 all squeegee the window frame away then i looked at it and tried to figure out and glass broke into
 splinters and the nails in the how to set it i could not even open it but i was roof
 sprang up leaving a space all round by the not going to be beaten so i went into the camp
 time the team was stopped it looked pretty sick took down the stanley mills catalogue and home opened it at
 traps i could see the thing open but the men unhitched the team put a heavy rope how that was
 done was another matter i was round the frame of the wagon and made the pulling at it with all
 my strength on it when i horses pull on the rope till the building was straight heard not set yet
 there was my husband again then they nailed cross braces on it to make grinning at me he took the
 trap and placing it it ready again for moving the roof could be fixed on the ground used his feet
 to open the jaws then later i saw that he had only been kidding me he was the horses wer
 e hitched up again but both re glad to know that i was game to try and had fused to
 budge an inch pulling them or using the hurried after me in fear that i would get my hand the
 whip made no difference everything proved caught in the teeth i never did set a trap so my ineffectual so
 after some time when one of the lesson didn help hor ses had lain down the men got another team
 we got our water from a slough at the bottom and off we set for our first camp i was
 not in of the hill and we had to get the day s supply early side but walking like the
 horses i had balked in the morning before the sheep broke camp or as this was a sheep district at
 that time we were else we got pretty dirty water as the summer adnot confined to our own land and
 the sheep were vanced the wigglers began to appear in the water moved to a new pasture each week and
 it was anything but nice to have to str ain them all summer we lived in the camp wagon at
 through a piece of cheesecloth it was a case of first we had two kitchen chairs and later i had
 an maun dae has nae inaister easy chair our bed was at the back and was plenty we were very
 much troubled with coyotes and high so hat boxes could be put below as there the sheep could not be
 left without a herder or was little extra room supplies were brought to they were sure to get into the
 band it would not us each week and of cour se i had no choice in have been so bad
 if only one sheep were caught what i got we had lots of salt pork and beans but ver y
 often the coyote would wound several and i often longed for fruit or vegetables but here before eating one was
 nothing of that kind to be had we did not use a corral for the sheep so when our first
 camp was on top of a hill from where the mosquitoes were bad we had to take our bed we
 could get a fine view of the sun ounding coun outside and lie in front of the flock or they
 would tr y but on no side of us was there any sign of be miles away by morning if
 a thunderstorm habitation we saw nothing but cattle and horses came up as it often did they sheep would become
 from morning till night except at rare intervals restless and sometimes stampede and many a time when a stray rider
 came out to the camp for a i was awakened roughly when the sheep would meal run over me when
 i was at my first camp i had lots of time when we left our home to go herding we
 did to think of my days back home when i could lie not lock the door but left everything so
 that any in bed till eight in the morning but there it was tired rider could get shelter the privilege
 was not getting up at 4 30 to make breakfast and many abused for each person left things as they
 found a morning while may husband was eating break them pots and dishes all clean and the fire r eady
 fast i would go after the sheep and turn the lead to light so that they could not wander too
 far the country was used only for grazing and there when i was cleaning the camp one morning were thousands
 of cattle and horses running wild a coyote came up from the coulee and began each spring and fall there
 was a round up when eating a dead sheep i thought if a trap was set calves and colts were
 branded and returned to the we could get him so i went to get my husband owner s for a
 fee generally of 5 00 to come back and set it i was very much hurt when the cattle came
 in droves and used our when he said i was a fine sheepman wife when camp wagon as a scratching
 post i often took a i couldn t even set a trap i thought he meant it tablecloth and shook
 it outside the door to try and 22 ‘ he neil sheep herd is seen at the ranch near burdeli
 alberta make them go away i was afraid to go near them were around as they seldom saw a rider
 a woman would cer when the insects were bad the horses and cattle tainly be a curiosity and as our
 camp wagon was came right up to the house and we built smudges always beside a slough we had stock
 all the time by burning straw and sagebrush the animals coming for water would stand in a long line to
 get the benefit of my first summer was made very miserable by the smoke you could put your hand on
 an the mosquitoes they decided i was something animal s back and kill as many mosquitoes as the fresh and
 no doubt green and they were evidently hand would cover fond of scotch bread making was one of my first
 great my arms and legs became a mass of blisters problems i got a packet of yeast cakes and tried
 and i could not keep from scratching them i really to follow the directions but i had many failures got
 scared when my legs began to swell and and few successes for several days the pans i looked blue in
 places so i thought it was time used were for baking powder biscuits and thereto try a remedy we had
 little in the line of medi fore shallow so the bread ran all over the oven cine at the camp
 so my husband suggested trying i thought to remedy that by putting pieces of cardbathing my legs with vinegar but
 the cure was board round the sides but great was my distress worse than the disease next i tried bathing
 with when the cardboard caught on fire when i hastily baking soda and found that as good as anything pulled
 the pans out of the oven and onto the floor but best of all was to take a supply of
 medicines the bread went flat then i tried baking with sourand ointments with us dough yeast it was made by
 keeping a little piece later on the flying ants got after me once of dough each time i baked and
 when needed when i was doing up my hair i bent down to steeping it in potato water no matter
 how carecomb it over the top of my head when i heard ful i was the bread would turn sour
 the second a pit pit pit from the stove i went over to see day and had to be fed
 to the dogs what it was and got a lot of ants down my back i had never seen dried
 apples before my mar that was when i discovered our stovepipe was riage and the first time i cooked them
 i put in so not tight and that there was enough room to let many that the lid soon lifted
 up and i had to take in the sunshine and the rain and the ants the in some out i
 did this several times and then realized sects nearly drove me crazy and i ran out to the that dried
 apples were not to be measured as ripe sheep where my husband was herding to ask him ones and i
 learned to steep them first before cookwhat was stinging me poor girl this is an awful ing all the fruit
 we used was dried apples country to bring you to he said i soon learned prunes peaches and pears our
 jam came in large to put a net on when mosquitoes or flying ants cans and was labelled as raspberry
 strawberry or 23 plum but the only difference in them was the two the snow was all gone and we
 moved to a labelling they all tasted alike more sheltered spot where we put up a corral as it got
 to fall we divided the ewes and lambs thinking that if another storm came up in the night for weaning
 both resented this and for the first we had the sheep safe two or three days the cries especially at
 night everything was looking its best now the rose were deafening we kept them apart for two bushes had on
 their autumn tints the grass had weeks but as a snowstorm came then we had turned to golden and the
 wild geese were soaring to put them together again the snow was new high above us all proclaiming that winter
 was apto the lambs and for the first day they ran from proaching we left the sheep with a herder
 then bush to bush or ate any green thing they saw but and made for our own home it was
 there we hey soon got down to digging like the rest i could planned to spend my first winter in

 at spy hill which was reached at 2 30 here a number of friends of the riders had assenibled and
 a substantial lunch was spread which being partaken of music and songs beguiled a lazy half hour the field then
 directed its course homeward in the course of the afternoon a coyote caused a view hallo and gave a short
