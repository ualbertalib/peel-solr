 113 from the editor s dugou t like the school teacher who when he came late for school changed the 
 clock we have our own ready made alibi for the date of issue of this number however unlike the teacher 
 we are merely being honest with ourselves and our readers heretofore our official publication date has been the first day 
 of may august november and february in spite of every effort however we seem to have developed the habit of 
 making our appearance about the middle of the above months the reason is that the first of the month has 
 been found to be an exceptionally busy time for the members of the patrician staff who despite all their devotion 
 to duty cannot do more than one thing at a time in view of this fact we have changed the 
 official date of publication to the fifteenth day of may august november and february respectively we believe that with this 
 change we can promise our readers that we will be out on time it is with a great deal of 
 pleasure that we offer our heartiest congratulations to the machine g un mechanized platoon on winning the cambridge challenge bowl 
 they have just cause to be very proud of their win for the competition is always keen for this coveted 
 trophy 
 114 taken along with the winning of the walker cup by the machine gun platoon of b company the record 
 of the regiment for last year is eminently satisfactory add our representation on this year s bisley team and we 
 can swell out our chests with very pardonable pride of course our task now is to prove that pride doth 
 not in this instance go before a fall by retaining these two trophies within the regiment for the coming year 
 it will be a fine test of our prowess and one to which we all look forward eagerly in this 
 issue we make a departure by printing actual photographs if ever an occasion demanded a little extra effort it is 
 the celebration of the silver jubilee of our gracious king s accession we hope the innovation will prove popular with 
 our readers and that we shall be able to produce more of these in the future one of the main 
 deterrents to this policy is it 3 heavy cost pictures will always add to the interest of any story and 
 we promise to print as many as we can afford if our readers will only nominate themselves all as agents 
 for the patrician and secure one other subscriber this doubling of our list would enable us to incorporate many new 
 improvements in our publication we are indebted to the daily colonist and the victoria daily times for the cuts of 
 the two photographs reproduced in this issue we hope you will enjoy the article on page 136 describing the work 
 of the royal canadian corps of signals this is a side of their work that is little appreciated outside of 
 their own corps but which is of great value to the country at large the time is approaching when we 
 again push off to camps and begin to think of classification und camp schools and rifle associations and things like 
 that we are looking forward to seeing a good many from winnipeg at sarcee this summer and hope that you 
 will bring whole bags full of news with you when you come west this issue completes volume two of the 
 patrician we are anxious to make volume three even bigger and much better than any issue so far our efforts 
 will be greatly helped if we receive suggestions and ideas from our readers as to their wants the ideal magazine 
 is the one which pleases its readers 
 115 so let us know what sort of material you like and we will do our best to procure it 
 for you incidentally i am sure that many of our readers must have some really good stories and news items 
 that should be printed if you have found out the horrible truth that you cannot write in a manner suitable 
 for publication let us have the idea and we will wrap a story around it it is the material especially 
 that pertaining to the regiment that we want most not yet have we the support we want from the ex 
 patricia s throughout the country we are grateful for the stories sent in of their doings but would like to 
 see our paper in every one of their clubs and homes and be able to keep a good liaison between 
 those who have served in the regiment any help that our readers can give tov ard this end news stories 
 subscriptions 0:subscrip 0:tions of course will be greatly appreciated by the editors as with other journals of this nature the 
 principal function of the patrician is the maintenance of esprit de corps and happy relations between scattered detachments of the 
 regiment and ex members it is with a view to increasing our influence in this connection that we make the 
 above appeal if you know of any ex member who is not aware of the existence of this magazine 0:mag 
 0:azine send us his name and address and we will be pleased to forward a complimentary copy yours faithfully it 
 is with deep regret that v e record the death of captain h l leverin r c e who was 
 killed in a motor accident in victoria on may 14th captain leverin s death came as a great shock to 
 all ranks in the garrison he was well known to all of us and will be greatly missed on all 
 sides our deepest sympathies are extended to mrs leverin 
 116 esquimalt station notes well weill the machine gun platoon have again proved that they can do it we wondered 
 two years ago whether their gesture in winning the walker cup was just a flash in the pan but hen 
 they turn around and win it a second time it must be because they delivered the goods we are glad 
 to offer our congratualtians on their fine showing and note that they are not wasting time in mutual admiration but 
 are training in deadly earnest to hold it again this year si weapon training has spread throughout the company lately 
 and the weekly training parades are largely given over to this form of activity with camp and annual classification looming 
 up very close now all ranks are doing their allotted bit of holding aiming and trigger pressing not to mention 
 the more complicated evolutions known as toet in preparation for an attempt to wrest the cambridge challenge bow 1 its 
 present holders incidentall next to ourselves there s no one we d like better to have it than its present 
 owners sjc sj the signallers spent a very busy three weeks recently filling the air with iddy umpties at the 
 conclusion of which lieut j g e morton r c c s district signal officer conducted the 
 117 annual classification although tho results are not yet out the signallers have already planned several ways of profitably spending

 126 the retort courteous by john w lawrence in those hectic days of 1914 when recruiting offices sprang up overnight 
 like mushrooms and when the flower of our land rushed in droves and crowds and avalanches to don misfit uniforms 
 and become heroes a la mode there came one bright morning to a certain recruiting station in toronto the prize 
 specimen of all those hordes taken by and large he was built like a guardsman six feet two in his 
 stocking feet forty eight around the chest and with muscles like grisled iron he was superb and the sergeant in 
 charge looked kindly on him and made him at home in due course he was despatched to barracks and more 
 or less fitted with a uniform and a set of equipment then he began his training he was an adept 
 pupil he learned with small effort and seemed to the manner born as it were his greatest triumph though came 
 on that eventful day when he was taken out for his first efforts with the honoured ross rifle on the 
 30 yards range he towered over the rest of the squad like a colossus and he stood there at ease 
 like a veteran the sergeant major looked at him appraisingly he was the most likely thing he had seen for 
 quite some time when his turn came to fire the above mentioned functionary gave him his especial attention fuller he 
 said that was the giant s name fuller have you ever handled a service rifle before no sir said fuller 
 standing like a statue at attention urn the sergeant major looked thoughtfully around u here sergeant brooks give this man 
 some firing point instruction the two lay down on the firing point and the sergeant explained the intricacies of trigger 
 pressing and those things which sergeants do explain when giving firing point instruction and then no 606789 put the butt 
 of his rifle to his broad shoulder glanced along the sights and fired five rounds the sergeant major went along 
 examining the effort of the amateurs opposite no 5 target he stopped and gazed long and earnestly the bull was 
 missing in five shots private fuller had completely demolished that sacred centre ring fullerl he thundered continued on page 141

 136 the royal canadian signals at work tho majority of the readers of this publication are familiar with the operation 
 of the r c signals insofar as military duties are concerned and it was thought that it might be of 
 interest to give a short synopsis of the wireless stations operated by the r c 3 other than those of 
 a purely military nature of these the largest system of stations is that known as the north west territories and 
 yukon radio telegraph system this system consists of a chain of stations with edmonton alta as it s southern terminal 
 and extending northwards to herschell island in the arctic ocean and westward to the yukon territory stations mainly are located 
 at the chief trading posts and mining centres along the athabaska river athabaska and great slave lakes mckenzie river and 
 great bear lake and three stations in the yukon many of these stations are located at points which have only 
 sprung into being in the past year of two by reason of mining discoveries etc and not shown on the 
 average map and in order that you may better visualise tha vast territory covered by this chain of stations the

 cases equipped for transmission 0:trans 0:mission and reception on both long and short waves the staffs at stations average three 
 men one of whom is trained as a mechanic for repair and maintenance work which is a vital factor as 
 at the majority of the stations transportation 
 137 is confined to two or three river boats per year in july and august the system is operated as 
 a commercial system that is all stations are open to accept business from the public at regular rates as laid 
 down from time to time all classes of domestic messages as well as cables etc are handled the system has 
 its own tariff book and this in conjunction with c f r c n r western union and postal telegraphs 
 tariff books allow of tolls for any class of message being computed to any part of the world commercial procedure 
 in operating receipt and delivery of messages and accounting is used solely the terminal at edmonton is the transfer point 
 for all traffic to and from cp a cn telegraph lines and is connected to these two systems by sounder 
 and teletype circuits edmonton is also the accountingoffice 0:accounting 0:office for the system this being a separate department from t

 aklavik dawson is the transferpoint for the government telegraph service in the yukon and 8 c which is operated by 
 the dept of public works and also for points in aiaska traffic for which is transmitted by radio telegraph to 
 stations of the u s signal corps who operate the stations in alaska norman and aklavik are transfer points for 
 boats operating in the arctic and also for stations operated by the dept of marine and those operated by private 
 mining companies personnel on all r c c sig stations are also trained as meteorologists by the meteorological dept and 
 they are the official observers it might be of interest to note here that weather reports are compiled throughout canada 
 at the same hour namely 0700 hrs and 1900 hrs e s t daily this means that at some of 
 the stations an operator must get up at 0230 hrs local time take our word that compiling this return in 
 the dead of winter with the thermometer ranging from zero to 70 below zero is no fun these weather reports 
 are transmitted twice daily to toronto and victoria and the reports from aklavik and dawson have an important bearing in 
 the forecast for the pacific coast weather reports are also furnished on request at a nominal charge from any station 
 to any parties operating aircraft in tin territories all arrivals and departures of aircraft being report od to the stations 
 concerned this has been an important factorin 0:factor 0:in the development of the north and its value in dollars and 
 gents cannot be computed the systam also handles free of charge traffic for various departments of the government between ottawa 
 and points in the north this traffic is not handed over to the two commercial companies at edmonton but is 
 handled from edmonton station by radio over whajt is known as the inter provincial radio system operated by the corps 
 with stations at edmonton winnipeg camp borden and ottawa to be continued
