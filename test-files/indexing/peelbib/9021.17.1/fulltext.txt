 past by robert c wheeler a fur trade historian has observed that the tempo of north american history would have
 been slower had the beaver been a fugitive illusive animal like the fox the indians quickly disc 3 vered that
 white men would trade useful goads for furs this exchange constituted the fur trade a system of barter between whites
 and indians it was said that axes knives mere nails being of tempered iron made stone hatchets and bone needles
 and awls antediluvian minnesota like much of canada was dr davis met the three divers and a prime target of
 the fur trader at one talked them into making a trip with time or another there were several him along
 a part of the minnesotahundred small trading or wintering posts ontario boundary waters he knew that within the geographical boundaries
 of these waters had served as one of the the present state each strategically main fur trade routes and that
 perhaps located on a route used by indians by they still held fur trade relics and they the late 18
 th century the fur business did at the foot of horsetail rapids had assumed large proportions with in davis and
 his divers found seventeen dependent traders and rival companies brass kettles ten were still nested competing for the riches in
 less than all 17 belonged to the nest fitting pera century hundreds of tons of trade fectly together in a
 graduated series goods were brought from europe and the smallest was six inches in diameter new france to the northwest
 by french and the largest 20 inches the kettles english and scotch traders we concluded were new when lost although
 20 th century historians davis presented them to the mmknow a great deal about the fur trade nesota historical society
 and out of his surprisingly little attention has been initial find came an organized project given to the actual trade
 goods their to search the fur trade routes the same origin methods of manufacture identi divers used by davis volunteered
 their fying marks and how they were packed services they had no knowledge of for shipment existing fur trade litera
 the history of the fur trade so our first ture gives a very incomplete picture move was to bring them
 to st paul the quetico superior project which i am where they were shown many pieces of about to describe
 has already contri fur trade goods from land excavations buted useful new information on trade such objects as axes pipe
 tomahawks goods bells and many other items they were shown silver crosses and exquisite cop in the fall of 1960
 dr e w davis per brooches long interested in fur trade history had an idea looking from his home high
 we believed the divers might be above lake superior davis saw some more interested if they knew something scuba divers
 working on a shipwreck about the nature and extent of the fur he recalled that the diaries of fur traders
 trade how goods were packed in 90 occasionally mentioned accidents pound bales at montreal for shipment to canoes upsetting in
 the rapids with loss the western posts of life and merchandise why not use grand portage a hilly 8 z

 of the minnesota historical society he presented this paper to the centennial conference on the history of the canadian west
 at ban f in 1967 1 the pigeon river was the gateway from from montreal to grand portage the lake
 superior to the maze of intercon fur traders used the huge montreal nected lakes and streams that form the canoe

 of feverish activity was smaller 26 feet of lesser draft also each summer of birch bark it carried about one

 american historian frederick jack long portage and reloaded into north son turner left this word picture piled canoes it was
 said that twenty north high with bales of peltries and propelled canoes were required to carry the contents of twelve

 by an act of nature thousands of provisions and equipment years ago glaciers produced these water our quetico superior underwater
 reways forming them conveniently in a search project began in the spring of general east west pattern leading the 1961
 at grand portage where we found fur trader from one watershed to another nothing of significance on our first try
 several months later our first major dis fortunately early canadian artists covery was made on the basswood river have left
 us records of how the fur northeast of ely diver don franklin traders travelled a brigade of barrel found 36
 iron trade axes and 24 assorted chested banty legged voyageurs as chisels and spears the axes were of sembled at
 lachine near montreal to different sizes but of the same type begin their 1500 mile journey to grand the chisels
 were used to cut holes portage frances hopkins painted the through the ice for spearing muskrat voyageurs camped en route
 along the beaver and for fishing the spears rocky shore of some lake or stream the though badly rusted were
 recognizable canoe pulled up and overturned to pro axes chisels spears and other iron vide shelter an obstacle like a
 water objects are listed in inventories of the fall couldn t be argued with the voya period as ironware geurs
 portaged or carried around it but rapids varied in drop in kind in volume a month after this find we
 returned and from season to season there was to the basswood to discover we had no single technique for getting
 through overlooked more than a thousand lead or around them the voyageurs often musket balls only a few feet from
 where lined their canoes some rapids they the axes were found it was here as ci poled pulled others they
 shot if they diver that i saw my first trade goods shot the rapids empty portaging the on the bottom
 a real thrill for one cargo this was a de charge if they working in the field of history shot
 rapids with a half load a demi one of the many interesting aspects charge accidents did happen of this project
 is that it combines re 2 in 1869 artist frances hopkins wife of a fur trader painted this view of
 voyageurs camped during the long gruelling trip to the west search in fur trade literature with re tween lake nipissing
 and georgian bay search under water in this connection particularly at parisienne and double one of our best leads came
 from the rapids journal of alexander henry the younger a trader who described a canoe accident between 1961 and 1965
 numerous his journal entry suggested that we searches were conducted separately by minnesota and ontario many were unsearch not only
 in the rapids and immediately below them but at greater successful but a surprising number prodistances beyond for according to
 duced results on the granite river a henry several bales had gone quite far part of the old grand portage
 fur route before sinking taking a cue from this we found such items as a briitsh shoe we moved out
 from the rapids into buckle of 1775 vitnage and a single iron deeper water where we began finding axe encrusted
 to it were some eight to trade beads don franklin picked up ten lead musket balls a gunf lint a
 mass an unidentified mass which turned out of small lead shot and a gun worm also to be an assortment
 of knives some with from the granite river came north west handles of bone and others of wood trade muskets
 when the rust was removed by electrolysis the marker s mi the same site produced gunflints a tials were revealed
 on one of the barrels metal pipe with burned tobacco still in later identified as an 18 th century birthe
 bowl several lumps of vermilion mingham maker of trade guns x rays paint used by the indians for decora of
 the muskets showed that both were tion even pieces of fabric loaded with shot late in 1961 the royal ontario
 at a set of rapids below curtain museum of toronto joined us in this pro falls where fur trader david
 thompson ject it was agreed that the two in near upset we recovered an excellent stitutions would share not only
 the arti trade musket in the laboratory our facts found but would exchange infor technician found the gunflint still held
 mation photographs techniques and firmly between the jaws of the hammer the results of research soon after join and even
 more amazing the small piece ing us the canadian team made signi of leather used to cushion the flint was
 ficant finds along the french river be intact 3 interesting by products of the search including an almost perfect 18
 th century for fur trade material are the archaic rum bottle and parts of gin and wine objects recovered in
 at least three in bottles these finds were interesting stances a small flint projectile point a because they confirmed stories
 that large section of a pottery vessel and a voyageurs drank heavily at this point six inch flint spear which
 certainly just before starting their long trip west proves that prehistoric peoples were using these same water routes long before
 in the late summer of 1963 we inthe advent of the white trader vestigated the site of fort st charles
 a french post built by la verendrye in the water conditions under which 1732 a dam at kenora has raised
 the our divers work make this project quite level of lake of the woods to some six different from other
 underwater archaeo feet above the old level immediately in logy far one thing the water is cold front of the
 historic post and some three and fresh and many objects are well to six feet deep we found the remains
 preserved for another the divers fre of a stone wharf extending about 30 quently work in fast water so far
 we yards out into the lake have not used lines the divers move freely through the current and have late
 in the summer of 1964 we redeveloped a technique of virtually turned to the granite river and added crawling along
 the rocky bottom two more discoveries to the list at little rock falls a short lift over and we use
 only experienced divers handy camping spot the divers began working in fast water an inexperienced turning up broken clay pipes
 parts of diver is apt to panic for his face mask pewter spoons beads and shot which can be whipped
 off by the strong cur seemed to indicate that the fur brigades rent or his regulator can be torn from
 also used it as a resting or camping his mouth the hazards are many in spot cluding snarls of invisible
 monofilament line left by fishermen fortunately we we then moved to horsetail rapids have had no serious accidents although the
 granite river site where davis had a diver not connected with our project found the nest of kettles this was
 the lost his life at silver falls looking for third time our divers had worked the trade goods such unauthorized
 search area and we were not too hopeful ing by the way is now unlawful in horsetail rapids is a
 bad one narrow minnesota fast and strewn with boulders obviously it gave the voyageurs trouble and it ordinarily the waters
 in which we still dumps a fair number of unwary work are quite clear but in the fall of modern
 canoeists each year in 1789 1963 we searched the pigeon river near alexander mackenzie described it as the site of
 fort charlotte a warehouse an irregular meandering channel depot at the west end of the grand terminating by a rapid
 and de charge of portage the visibility in the pigeon one hundred eighty paces this des river here was zero
 because it drains cription fits horsetail though mackenzie through muskeg and the water is dis didn t call it by
 name colored with tannic acid so we had to devise a different technique a line while the shore crew watched
 divers was run from the shore to a point mid brought up an almost perfect voyageur s way in the
 river along the bottom at clay pipe complete with long stem bethe end of each eight foot section of line
 fore long a diver surfaced again about we fastened a long metal stake each out of air and reported what
 he believed diver was responsible for covering his to be a bundle of spears we had been eight foot section
 of the rope as it was waiting for such an opportunity having moved forward along the bottom this made our
 share of mistakes in the past meant that he had to search by feel moving things and losing the opportunigroping
 through about four inches of ty to study and photograph material in muck in spite of these laborious efforts position
 in the early years our methods we recovered about two dozen objects were pretty haphazard we improved 4 divers inspect
 36 trade axes and an assortment ol 24 ice chisels and spears discovered below rapids on basswood river near ely
 minnesota left to right are curt anderson don franklin and dennis dalen them gradually however especially we left the mass
 of material on the after the conference on underwater bottom and on the 10 th of september archaeology which was
 sponsored by returned loaded with tents airlift and our society in 1963 that conference camera gear first we ran a
 line from gave us a splendid opportunity to learn shore to the middle of the stream just what was being
 done all over the world below the base of the rapids the water the third conference was held in 1967
 at the end of the rapids dropped from in miami two feet down a slope of about 25 degrees to
 six feet then at 45 degrees and now back to horsetail rapids to a pool depth of 15 to 18
 feet the another diver in the process of feeling current made it difficult for a diver to around the bundle

 on the route there was no sensation of the camera to slave lake which we crossed and firing except for
 the flash encamped at its lower end it is called ‘ the portage of the drowned and it re after
 it had been well photographed ceived that name from a melancholy and measurements taken the divers accident which took place
 many years ago two canoes arrived at the upper carefully lifted the mass to the surface end of the portage
 in one of which there our spears turned out to be a bundle was an experienced guide this man of
 files these were needed to sharpen judging from the height of the river deemed it practicable to shoot the rapid
 axes and knives hudson s bay corn determined upon trying it he accordingpany records in london reveal that in ly
 placed himself in the bow of his canoe the year 1733 the company was trading having previously agreed that if
 the one file for one beaver skin passage was found easy he should on reaching the bottom of the rapid
 fire a in 1963 the quetico superior under musket as a signal for the other canoe to follow the rapid
 proved dangerous water research project received its first and called forth all the skill of the guide 4 000 grant
 from the national geo and the utmost exertion of his crew and graphic society s committee on research they narrowly
 escaped destruction lust as they were landing an unfortunate and exploration up to that time we fellow seizing the loaded
 fowling piece had operated on a shoestring in a nurn fired at a duck which rose at the instant ber
 of cases services were donated the the guide anticipating the consequences divers of course volunteered at cur ran with the
 utmost haste to the other end of the portage but he was too late tam falls a cessna 180 on
 floats was the other canoe had pushed off and he placed at our disposal on the knife arrived only to
 witness the fate of his lake trip the u s forest service donated comrades they got alarmed in the mida
 beaver increased funds permitted the die of the rapid the canoe was upset and every man perished purchase of more
 sophisticated diving equipment needed camera gear and the thanks to the research efforts of construction of our airlift our college
 history majors we now have a second major break through came listed some 50 different accidents all in 1965 when
 we employed college carefully plotted on a map and we have also assembled a wealth of information history students to
 search fur trade literature for recorded accidents especi on canoe routes methods of negotiating obstructions and good clues to possible
 ally productive were the personal jour future search sites nals and diaries of such traders as thompson the two henrys
 alexander incidentially this research shows mackenzie franklin pond fidler and that fur trade accidents didn t happen others to give
 you an idea of how and every day or even very frequently where these accidents happened shortly after the union
 of the north west would like to quote from a few first and hudson s bay companies in 1821 hand
 accounts william mcgillivray took nicholas cumberland and hudson house jour garry to lachine to give him some idea nals 1778

 me he was 12 ing his long association with the north days weather bound in the sea lake west company
 one half of one per cent which is the cause of his late arrival would cover all the losses the
 company he also inform d me that he has accompanied two of the canadian traders sustained from lost canoe cargoes
 holmes and graves with ten canoes going up aloft he says they lost two in 1965 we took advantage of
 this canoes one on the great fall and an research to dive for the first time at a other in
 crossing the cedar lake by site where we knew trade goods had carrying too much sail the men was saved
 but no goods been lost walter icenyon of the royal 6 ontario museum and i made plans for the advantage
 of his situation jumped a joint expedition to the winnipeg river whilst the current whirled the canoe around the steerman
 finding himself to look for trade goods lost by alexander within reach of shore jumped upon the henry the younger

 midman not being sufficiently active but let s let henry himself tell it remained inthe canoe which was instantly carried
 out and lost to view from the diary of alexander henry amongst the high waves at length she the younger
 1800 appeared and stood perpendicular for a moment when she sank down again aug 9 th at daybreak we embarked
 and i then perceived the man riding giving the indians each a dram we were upon a bale of dry
 goods in the midst troubled by a thick fog which caused us of the waves we made every exertion to
 lose much time in going round the to get near him and did not cease callbays we at last got
 astray and were out to him to take courage and not let obliged to wait until the weather cleared go

 the bale arose to portage de lisle about 50 paces the man appeared no more the over one of my
 canoes to avoid the canoe we found flat upon the water trouble of making this portage passed broken in many
 places however we down near the n shore with a full load hauled her ashore and afterward col as my
 own canoes was soon over the lected as many pieces as we would find portage we loaded and embarked and
 the men had landed a few packages on pushing from shore i perceived the above the rapid otherwise our loss

 this would eat up valuable time so we and we went up to take aerials purchased a bendix depth finder

 white school teachers clergymen traders rcmp personnel and other public servants it is located in the north eastern corner of

 social classes the writer apparently aristocratic bourgeois and proletarian overlooked the fact that say in 1860 each of these in

 g thomas this paper is an attempt to sketch the histoniography of the canadian west in the period when the
 region was dominated by the fur trade although there is today a respectable body of historical writing on the canadian
 west there exists as far as i am aware nothing in print that attempts to examine that body as a
 whole no attempt to examine the directions it has taken or the historical philosophies of those who have contributed to
 it though there is a general recognition among students of the field of the importance of particular contributions for example
 arthur silver morton s monumental work a history o the canadian west to 1870 71 no one has tried to
 do for western canadian history what professor j m s careless has done for canadian history in the largest sense
 in his seminal article frontierism metropolitanism and canadian history which appeared in the canadian historical reviezv of march 1954 it
 would be unpardonably arrogant even to hope that this paper could fill the gap at most it can only indicate
 that a gap does exist and perhaps that the gap ought to be filled it seems best for the purposes
 of this voyages of 1801 or john west s journal of paper to limit discussion largely to the 1824 of
 course we must recognize their histoniography of the prairie west or importance without such sources we perhaps more precisely to
 that of the should have no histoniography it is region lying west of hudson bay and however as sources that
