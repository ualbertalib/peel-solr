 mary e inderwick in september 1883 mary ella lees left her home in perth ont and went on the newly
 built c p r to join her brother at mountain mill west of pincher creek her brother w r lees
 had come out a year earlier to establish a lumber mill for senator peter mclaren and finally agreed to let
 his sister come to stay with him much against her family s wishes mary and her maid lizzie left ontario
 and went by rail to calgary en route mary met a young rancher charles inderwick who seven months later became
 her husband after travelling overland from calgary to fort macleod mary met her brother and went to her logging camp
 home on april 13 th 1884 she married mr inderwick and moved to his home at north fork ranch twenty
 two m i 1 e s north west of pincher creek where later in the same year she wrote this
 letter to her sister in law the ranch was owned jointly by her husband and jonas jones but two years
 later in 1886 in the face of mounting debts they sold out to a b few in her letter likely
 written with future publication in mind mrs inderwick deliberately changed the names of persons and places pincher creek and fort
 macleod were called saint francis and fort lorne in her manuscripts but were correctly named in her first draft such
 names as james draynor mrs borden mr barret mr leslie miss smith mrs lingham and mrs comstock are all ficticious
 although the persons are real fortunately mrs inderwick also kept a diary during this period so some persons can be
 identified the men are for the most part unknown although the most frequent visitors mentioned in her diary are f
 w godsal f dewinton and a h lynch staunton the original manuscript and diary are now in the glenbow foundation
 archives calgary and the letter is published with the kind permission of mrs c c inderwick of perth ont the
 editor i have been living here six months times if one has any friends or if it is and have
 never written you but you everyone for himself and the devil take have not written me and i thought your
 the hindmost however i shall come to honeymcon had swept me from your the bothersome humans later and shall memory
 till i got your idiotic post card tell you lots of lovely things first idiotic but how gladly welcomed we
 are on a cattle ranche which is dear this is the only life i have very large and well watered
 having any number of troubles in fact too several creeks running through it as numerous to mention but i forget
 them well as its two boundaries the west and all in this joyous air with the grand middle forks of
 the old man river the protecting mountains always standing other boundary is the mountains so we round the western horizon
 they seem are in the foothills no plains here but the very spirit of the old hymn abide the most
 glorious ranges of hills and rolwith me oh thou that changest ling prairie they all seem so near that not
 ‘ and they are the dearest most one starts to ride to a certain landmark constant of friends and alice
 let me tell but finds oneself still no nearer at the you that in this small corner of this end
 of an hour i saw the white roofs of mighty north west one wonders some the houses of pincher creek
 the other day though we were 22 miles away then there are the exciting rides think of the delights of
 this clear air when i go with charlie to drive a bunch then let the housekeeper in you think of
 of cattle to another part of the range the appetites which this air gives men the other day we were
 out and i was to and women though we don t count much drive some cattle through a coulee while
 in this way here and the huge meals charlie rode over the hill to bring some that must be forthcoming
 at regular in others the coulee was a narrow little tervals every day pass between two high hills and all
 the we have a cow camp a shack for cattle went through except three old the cowboys and they have
 their own bulls they stood pawing and growling cook so we only get an occasional one and looking at the
 horses in a way that for meals if he happens to be riding would have appalled me had i been
 on nearer the house than the camp they the highest hill on foot but having joy are a nice lot
 of men i love their at under me i cared for nothing so i tried tempts to help me appear
 civilized to ride up to them waving my quirt a though they ride in flannel shirts they plaited leather whip
 the cowboys never come to the table in shirt sleeves always use it hangs over the wrist by they have
 a black alpaca coat hanging a leather loop and it makes a very conin the shack attached to the house
 and venient whip i use it on the range but each one struggles into it to live up to i
 have a lovely crop for pincher creek the new regime which began with a and church bride at the ranche
 this is done so en to return to my bulls they looked thusiastically and with such good will as though
 they were going to have a that i have no qualms of conscience that free fight and joy was determined
 not i am a nuisance not like a young eng to take part he swerved and turned lishman who came
 out to stay with us and would not face them i thought if and came to dinner in a flannel
 shirt we rode up they would move on and i with no collar and no tie and when i wanted
 to get through but joy thought hinted to him that i expected a coat he differently evidently for he behaved
 in bought a buckskin one trimmed with such a determined way the bulls by blue flannel and wore it i
 spoke of this this time were making horrid noises and to charlie and he said it was that he lashing
 their tails and horns casting had always had to dress for dinner and threatening looks on me struggling with now
 he wanted a change and liked to an obstinate horse just in the midst of play tough but when he
 had been this charlie came riding down the hill roughing it a while he would appreciate calling to me to
 go back he had to fire anyone trying to live in a civilized way two or three shots over their
 heads be the cowboys anyway back me in fore they moved on out of that wretched my attempts and indeed
 back me in all narrow coulee it makes me shudder to my schemes because i ride well i verily think
 of it for charlie said if joy had believe if i did not ride they would have gone up to
 them they would have gored nothing to do with me as it is they are him and where would i
 have been we rather proud of me and oh alice i do won t pursue that question believe i could
 still take pleasure in i hardly ever blunder into such difriding if i were a deaf mute and you ficulties
 and generally can drive a few know what a trial that would be to a red cattle all right they
 do look lovely on haired girl like me if you could only the sunny slopes all looking so happy feel
 the rocking motion of a good lope and strong and handsome i have my through the grass and hear the
 creak of mind full of the finest pictures and if i the saddle and see the horses fresh look could
 transfer them to canvas my fame after a long ride at this pace especially would be made forever my own
 beauty joy when john there are other days and rides this my cook breaks my best cut glass dish i
 is when i go out with charlie to bring in fly to the stables and have my joy some horses
 and if they are bronchos we saddled and ride till i know that cut simply follow joy and i joy
 would glass is nothing to make or mar one s scorn to take any easy cut so we go lovely
 day over the steep sides of hills at a break 2 ah i should not tell you these things for
 i am sure they sound terrifying to you in the lazy lap of luxury they would have to me a
 year ago but they are only incidents of interest and little ‘ excitement now whether i ride alone or ‘‘
 with charlie or with a party as we sometimes do i love it i sometime and very often long for
 a woman to come and live near me i have made all sorts of offers to a few of the
 men who are near us in the way of helping them to get their shacks done up if only they
 will go east and marry some really nice girls but they are all so far from being in love with
 anyone and so charming that they answer me the only really nice girl we know is married with the most
 cheerful grins at me that it ends in laughter as many things do here we have a very large ranche
 miles and miles leased from the government at the author mrs inderwick loved her a cent an acre it sounds
 silly but if ranch in the pincher creek district your lease is large the rent is enough for everything is
 an experiment here now the country is so young and losses seem to me to be much more common neck
 pace where a false step would end than gains however i was going to exin disaster but joy never makes
 it nor plain that there are a lot of young men does captain charlie s horse we gra who have
 fenced in a couple of acres of dually head off these flying horses and land on the range with charlie
 s perbring them nearer and nearer the cor mission and farm and have a few horses rals til we at
 last get them safely inside it seems a hard life for very little return and oh then for a cup
 oftea if it is except that it suits the nomadic nature afternoon and a quiet hour in my sunny of
 the men the odd part and the splensitting room i in my small rocking chair did part is that they
 are almost all charlie smoking in his long easy chair gentlemen and their shacks with earth and both so happy
 and contented floors go to my heart so i ask them for often i ride alone and then i see
 meals all or sundry extremely often such wonderful things i come suddenly john my cook calls them the locusts and
 on a small pond with ducks a pond one delightful scotchman he calls the i must have been the discoverer
 of as no chief of the locusts and not a scottish one knew of it and all wanted to see
 it chief as you might think the irreverent but i have absolutely no bump of locali kid at the cow
 camp calls him the ty and i never could find it again once lord s own nephew because he heard
 an animal which i believe to have been that he is the nephew of lord c i a mountain lion
 disclosed itself to view do not know how he heard it as mr in among some small hillocks but it
 draynor has never mentioned the fact looked so surly that we lost no time in to us getting out of
 sight another day a big i am at the present time the only grey wolf stood and looked sternly at
 white woman on this river or the next me i levelled my crop at him but he only added scorn
 to his appearance and stood his ground he was out on an england he was sometimes referred to locally open
 plain and not near me as lord brooke 3 er for that matter as the next ranche is i have
 tried to make use of a squaw owned by a bachelor i am 22 miles who is the nominal wife
 of a white man from a woman and though i like all the near us to do the wushing but
 had to men and enjoy having them i simply give it up she stolidly went on rubbing long to talk
 to a woman so about once a table napkin all the time i was away a month i ride into
 pincher creek with from her side one morning and when i charlie and stay a night with my dear returned
 hoping to see a tubful of washest friend here mrs borden 2 she is such ed clothes i found one
 table napkin in a whole souled splendid woman she holes the result of an hour s work when was the
 first white woman in pincher i showed her how to scrub the floor she creek and came by way of
 covered wag sat in the middle of the floor aimlessly gon from montana with her two children slopped all round
 her poor james what splendid pluck it does me good draynor who was once they declare a to talk to
 her and every man loves her missionary and poor araminta i give not in a sighing silly way but because
 up the task of training her the odds she always makes them comfortable and were too much for my courage
 and padarns their clothes and talks to them tience and i now send my washing to sternly if they are
 doing anything a dignified coloured lady in pincher wrong i am sure she has done more creek 4 who boasts
 that she and the good than 10 parsons could have done police commissioner s wife were the first at any
 rate the sort i have met out here white ladies to arrive in the country it does seem to me
 a shame that there time is nothing to her and if i were an are parsons here for the indians
 and ordinary woman and not a bride with none for the dozens of young men eng a good trousseau i
 shiver to think what lish irish scotch and canadian who so might happen to me when weeks go by sadly
 need the restraining influence of a and no laundry can be cajoled from our strong manly tactful christian leader aristocratic
 auntie s stately dwelling they are all broad minded enough to shall i tell you about my first ball overlook
 the creed as it is there is only at fort macleod at the police barracks one man of this sort
 here now and he is on our invitation was written the name the roman catholic priest at the fort of
 the people with whom we were to 30 miles away a he comes to pincher stay we were new people
 and knew no creek every fortnight and holds service one so we were kindly taken in by a and attends
 to the needs of his small livery stable keeper and his sister 5 at flock he is a truly good
 man and if he least i was for charlie had some sort is a jesuit he is such a thorough
 one of a shakedown in somebody s office my that he appears to be only a simple maid also had
 an invitation and stayed minded noble gentleman he is a bel in the same place i have since let her
 gian and speaks english with a slight go as she got so discontented with her foreign accent which is an
 added charm position it was the first ball to which everyone likes him the squaws were not allowed to go
 but i shall tell you sometime about a there were several half breeds it is a visit i made to
 the indian reserve and prohibition country and my dear i somethe two clergymen settled on the reserve times wonder that
 i do not develop a to teach the indians i think the indians fierce thirst for whiskey for 9 men
 out should have been isolated in the moun of every 10 seem to suffer from it and tains and left
 with their own lives and it is always to be got in some way ways of living and never allowed
 to eat always costly and never good of the fruit of knowledge as revealed by 2 mrs a m morden
 who came to the area from the white men who came to live among hamilton ont in 1880 them they
 could teach civilization a 8 father leonard van tighem an oblate priest great deal too but our inconsistencies went to
 fort maclead in 1883 by 1885 he had are too subtle for his direct mind and churches at pincher creek
 and lethbridge and in 1888 he was transferred to the latter point when he tries to follow he is lost
 and mrs sanderson a negro woman came to the area under the circumstances the sooner he as a servant of
 mrs james f maclead and was becomes extinct the better for himself fondly known as auntie and the country 5
 d horan the local shoemaker and his sister north fork ranch in the pincher creek area was the home of
 mr and mrs c h a r i e s inderwick this view was taken in about 1884 at first
 we knew very few people man he knew they were still sitting as none of the men near us had
 come in talking business when we arrived she and there was only one pincher creek was quite heart broken and
 i was very woman for whom i do not care but sorry for her but could not see why she
 there was a young canadian whose should feel so badly when her fiance had brother the editor of a paper
 i knew a home waiting for her and had wanted slightly at home with his half breed her to marry
 him a month before when wife he had been cheering himself with i said why not send him word that
 she more than one drink and while charlie would marry him next day she dried her had gone for my
 handkerchief which i tears and wrote the note had left in the dressing room he came we left for home
 early in the mornup and asked me to dance i said i was ing though there was a concert on
 for engaged but charlie did not appear and that evening and an impromptu dance he was growing cross and i
 desperate but i had had enough and was wild to when a broad shouldered officer turned gel away round and
 said to me ah this is our dance mrs indeiwick i felt that he fort macleod is one of the
 last should have had the victoria cross that places to live in all the world it is on he saved
 my life we have since got to a bare flat spot high above the river know him very well and
 like him he is covered with small stones which the from halifax as two or three of the never ceasing
 wind drives hither and nicest officers are thither with little clouds of dust the barracks lies south of the cluster
 of log i met some very nice men but i am huts called the town and the whole effect bound
 to say i thought the women were is disheartening in the extreme how rather a lot of cats more or
 less though the people live here happily i do not since i have discovered two very sweet know and i
 don t think they are very ones the dance was more odd than de happy they seem so gossipy and
 so lightful when we arrived home back at different from what the women ought to our quarters i found my
 hostess in tears be in the west but i think most of their it seems she was engaged to a
 protestant husbands drink very hard when occaagainst her brother s wishes and through sion offers and that seems very often
 the uplifting influence of some liquor he had managed to get decided to send 61 n her diary mrs inderwick
 noted that miss horan had been married to parker on new year s her home and had enforced this by
 sell night her brother being at last talked into reason ing the house and everything in it to a over
 it 5 that they are all with one or two excep time being the only colonist among so tions bitter
 many english mr barret who was they are so different from my dear there said you are mistaken i am
 a whole souled mrs borden she is a colonist as you call it and in a few methodist and does
 not go to dances i words managed to show this very imwas there one sunday when we met two possible
 man that he was overstepping englishmen and all went to a methodist the bounds of politeness i afterwards service with
 her at the barracks it cer found that mr barret had been born at tainly was a poor service and
 the mm the cape his father was in the navy ister not very eloquent though very and was stationed there
 for a time earnest and suffering all sorts of hard it strikes me very forcibly all the ships in his
 good cause but he was the time how inately different we are from wrong sort of man to do much
 good to those from the british isles people of wicked humanity he was learned in this school master s type
 had had a deall but sympathy with young men s high cent education a very good home and spirits and
 love of fun and he lacked his people were in comfortable circumnice genial manners one of mrs bor stances just
 as good perhaps as many den s englishmen who had just arrived of us canadians still he is far beneath
 from england attacked the minister and us in every way in himself in a word the whole service in such
 an uncharit he is not a gentleman and all that lowable way that i lost my temper and he er
 middle class are the same i suppose thinks now that i am an ardent metho the difference really is that
 our parents dist you remember our feelings when and grand parents were gentle people we went to that methodist revival
 meet and in spite of the hardships of canading out near misty lake i could never ian life in their
 generations preserved be a methodist after that but i was so the true spirit of gentle breeding angry for mrs
 borden s sake though she i at times found the companionship seemed only amused at the whole con of fresh
 englishmen very trying to my versation that i glorified the whole nerves charlie was away for a week church including
 the awkward little and his partner in the ranche 8 and a man who preached to us friend of charlie
 s with whom he had there are so many englishmen here gone to school and had met in fort macand
 a couple of english women the leod one day were left at the ranche latter are of very different types
 but the and talked england to me as i thought men are almost all nice though they 50 stupidly showing
 me beautiful photonearly all have no tact in the way they gi aphs of oxford and comparing her talk of
 canada and canadians the beauties with winnipeg and her uncrowning insult to me is the cool way in couthness i
 asked how old oxford is which they say but we do not look on and then remarked that winnipeg was
 you as a canadian and they mistake about 9 years of age and it seemed odd this for a compliment
 it makes my can to compare a young and lusty baby with adian blood boil i answer that though a
 learned polished and very beautiful i have married an englishman i have woman the daughter of culture and the not
 lost my identity and i am purely best in everything in art and science canadian and am proud of it
 they i rather thought i scored over this simply do not understand that i really but i completely lost my
 temper when mean it mr leslie offered to bring me some nest one day we had the village school eggs
 from england when he returned master here he is an englishman but from his next holiday i said oh why
 of a very different class to the men we go to england for nest eggs you can know 7 he
 began to badger me about buy them in fort macleod medicated canada and was surprised that i did too it
 was not the words but the tone not answer but just took all he said as that told and next
 time he and mr barinformation at last he said why i 7 a e cox who was school teacher at
 pincher creek heard that you are very easily roused in from 1884 to 1891 defense of your country and have
 a bad 8 jonas jones 6 so very insular and perhaps it is best when they have been out here
 for a few jj years when they become the most delightful men in the world even in their fresh state
 i can t help liking them but the women the few who have come to these wilds are so unsuited
 to the surroundings one whom we shall call miss smith of london lives with four brothers and has brought all
 her traditions with her i went to call ‘ and was ushered in and announced by one of the brothers
 a small woman with a very prominent nose and teeth rose from a low chair beside an open grate stove
 and greeted me in a voice that sounded to me like a fog horn it made me jump and think
 anxiously of how long i would be expected to stay but i soon became accustomed to this booming sound from
 such a small body and rather enjoyed myself charlie and one brother joined us ‘ while another brought in a
 tea table and ‘ ‘ then the tea tray just as deftly as any butler miss smith who is older
 than the eldest brother took it all as a matter charles inderwkk was an englishman who of course her brothers
 had been in the bought a ranch in the pincher creek distnct 1 in the early 1880 s country some
 time but she had deen a brief month they invited us to dine ret began to talk to me about
 england i and sleep a couple of weeks ago and i burst out with oh don t england me quite
 enjoyed myself there was a cerany more i am so sick of it wasn t it tam excitement about it
 which is lacking awful but the weather was bad and i elsewhere for we had to dress for dincould not
 get out my domestic arrange ner one so very seldom wears a low ments were not going very smoothly and
 dress that when one does the occasion this never ending laudation of england is a remarkable affair the dinner was
 got on my nerves very simple as they keep no cook but when charlie returned i told him i do
 all the work themselves and when would not be left again with two eng we rose and swept from the
 dining room lishmen though they had tried to be we did not leave the men to enjoy a nice because
 they knew so very little of quiet smoke only but to wash up they canada but thought they knew so
 much appeared later looking guiltless of ever and had made me so angry he went to having seen a dish
 towel or dirty plate their shack and asked them what they i often wonder how miss smith had been saying
 to me to make me so passes her time having no household resentful they declared they had tried duties and
 not being a very ardent horse very hard to entertain me and keep me woman her drawing room is a
 rather from being lonely another englishman pretty room one great attraction being who had come home with charlie re a
 small english upright piano which will marked well we must be a very insist on going out of tune in
 this very bumptious race we are hated whenever dry climate but it is still a great pleawe step off our
 own little island and sure as it is the only one i know on a we don t mean to
 be disagreeable either charlie himself in telling me of 9 miss garnett with her brothers jack louis walter this said
 i think it is because we are and arthur 7 ranche they have one at the barracks oughly thankful to
 get outside again into at fort macleod but i know of none god s gocd september air still there is
 nearer a charm about these two people living you should see miss smith in the simple life of hardship and
 toil to church she wears always the same hat which they are so unaccustomed and so a black english walking
 hat with a handicapped by want of training but black veil and a mannish coat she appreciating so fully the
 smallest prolooks very neat and you could mistake duct of their toil it is a pleasure to her for nothing
 but an englishwoman hear of their triumphs though after this and to her this is a very good way of
 shall be glad to hear of them only paying her a direct compliment she but alice the third is a
 very pretty asks nothing better woman and altogether a man s woman 0 there are two other english women she
 sings and twangs a guitar rides of very different types one lives with rather well has a delightfully musical her
 husband on a small ranche near voice and speaks always quickly and pincher creek and is devoted to dogs as
 it were joyously she also smokes she invited me out to see a real english cigarettes with the men i
 know you will home so we rode over one lovely after say i am putting on modest airs in maknoon
 and found the home a very small ing much of her smoking but darling place cut up into many small
 boxes you know i never smoked cigarettes with dignified by high sounding names but anyone but jack and charlie that
 is what s in a name indeed the rooms the very highest compliment i can pay a were so small
 and so dark that coming man and so far i have reserved it for in from the glare i inadvertently
 sat my own brother and husband but she down on a chair which already held smokes sitting on the restaurant
 steps three puppies my terror equalled theirs with half a dozen men of course her and it was a long
 time before peace was husband is one of them and worst of all restored luckily for them i am a
 light she looks so pretty over it weight and did not sit down heavily she and her husband came to
 see there seemed to me to be pups all us and of course had to stay all night i over
 the place not only on the chairs had such a bad time there those four but in the air i
 mean i could fancy i breathed them and when tea arrived ‘ jii her diary mrs inderwirlc refers to a
 number and i was given a sloppy cup full of of women whom s ic frequently saw these indude mrs
 leslie wi lock mrs charles kettles milky tea and some home made bread mrs george lies mrs j geddes mrs
 j heron one can get no other kind i found and mrs scobie the women in her letter likely great
 trouble in disposing of it though lie from this group mrs lingham seems quite pleased and proud of her english
 home i was thor view of the corrals and stables of north fork ranch in about 1884 8 english people
 sat talking of england ing cattle to the nearest hay stack or the pantomine of their childhood the at any
 rate driving them from the opera military tournaments races i thickets near a stream where they go for can t
 tell what not and all smoking shelter but remain to die cows differ and mrs comstock was making the most
 from horses in this way a horse will beautiful eyes at charlie of all people paw and uncover the grass
 but a cow now dear just imagine how really mad has no such instinct she eats only such i felt
 inside but determined to put up a stray stuff as may stand out from the good front and seem to
 like it and the snow this pall of snow throws a shacharming things she said to him i could dow
 over our days for as long as it lasts not tell you just what they were for they 10 days
 even two weeks and every would not sound the same without her ear is listening for the happy sound of
 pretty intonations and arch looks he the first murmuring of a chinook thinks her such an innocent intelligent witty woman
 quite a rare specimen in one night we were sitting just as i deed aren t men all vain she
 flatters have told you and suddenly someone said the chinook we were all outside charlie and he believes all she
 says it in a second there was a low roar in the makes me wild and still dearest he is

 in i only love him more but with a protect and made coffee and were a much more ing love
 in this case for i know she is a flirt and only wants every good looking joyful party than an
 hour before that young man at her beck and call married night one end of our roof was carried off
 but i was in another part of our or single but married preferred because of the added zest given the
 game by rambling house and sleeping like the hurting the feeling of some woman enchanted princess i did not hear
 any however even if she were to break my thing but was content to know that the heart which she
 cannot do i would not long looked for wind was reducing the give her the satisfaction of knowing she hated
 snow to great poois of water and had even hurt me freeing the grass and saving our precious cattle from
 starvation it is a won i know you are saying why oh why derful wind in twelve hours the snow

 the sister by sheilagh s jameson one of the most worthy centennial projects carried out in alberta in 1967 was
 the erection of a memorial to a woman whose accomplishments should serve as an inspiration to women of all time
 the project to honor her undertaken by the women of alberta culminated in a simple but impressive ceremony in the
 alberta legislative building on march 16 1967 this was the presentation to the legislature of a portrait of roberta catherine
 macadams who had the distinction of being one of the two first women representatives in the alberta legislature and the
 first and only woman representative to be elected by the armed services in the british empire the portrait was accepted
 by premier e c manning hon arthur dixon speaker and m maccagno leader of the opposition on behalf of the
 people of alberta the suggestion that such a tribute cumbed to the lure of newspaper life be paid to roberta
 macadams was made came west and was city editor of the by mrs cornelia r wood m l a at

 the first step in establishing leslieville village occurred in 1906 when edmund bureau built the above store and stopping house

 methodists early made their so he went but very unwillingly they home available for services and settlers brought all their
 furniture and all was began gathering there from near and well until they reached red deer when far regardless of
 denominational differ their troubles began they bought a ences to attend meetings which were team and wagon got their stuff
 loaded conducted by any ministers who came and started for the homestead but not to our locality the reillys were
 musical being accustomed to such things as mud people who possessed an organ and holes a n d crooked trails
 fording their oldest daughter mattie was also streams and balky horses or horses of a fine singer the first minister
 from the any kind they got discouraged turned outside to hold a service was mr pat around and went back
 thoroughly disstone from lacombe he was followed enchanted with the much vaunted by others whose names i do not recall
 west but mrs mcneil was one of but they were generally students from those who do not give up easily
 her the different denominational colleges husband s health demanded it so later who spent their summers ministering to on they
 made another attempt and f inscattered congregations in the newly ally reached their son s homestead settled west country when
 mrs mcneil saw the sod about that time a young man house which was to be her home all her
 named fred mcneil came from london dreams of a cozy comfortable little ontario took up a homestead not far cabin

 she was a only one of its kind in the district his brave woman and optimistic and so she parents
 mr and mrs john mcneil were started making the best of setting up to follow him as soon as he
 had built a housekeeping in her new domain with house for them to live in mr mcneil the help of
 my husband and his oxen had for many years worked as a motor logs were hauled from a nearby ravine
 21 and lumber from a distant sawmill a log was a gala day for all concerned in house was finally
 built and made warm those days any occasion that brought and comfortable people together was a social affair a time
 for fun and good natured jollity during the ensuing months this lady generally with something to eat which played an
 important part in the lives was always a treat to those who hapand doings of the leslieville community pened to
 be bachelors afterwards a it was she who first saw the need of a nephew of mrs mcneil cleaned the
 church building and promptly started to paddles and decorated them finishing do something about it the mcneils them with the
 date of the occasion i were methodists but the country was still have my paddle fast filling up with people
 of different beliefs and little attention was paid to the finishing of the interior of the denomination mrs mcneil evolved
 a building was done by john reilly who plan whereby a building could be built was an experienced carpenter he
 also by the settlers themselves all working made a pulpit and a large number of together meetings were called and
 seats to accommodate future congregaplans were made to decide the size of tions at one of several meetings held the
 building the site was already concerning this project the naming of settled as mr bureau had generously the new building
 was the subject of donated a square plot of land measuring some controversy as was often the half an acre
 as most of the home case mrs mcneil calmed the troubled steaders were interested in the project waters with this
 suggestion why not they went to work promptly and in a call it bethel union church and the short time
 the required number of logs idea caught on as it seemed a fitting were hauled and piled at the building

 the claim which was taken up before survey comprises the west half of section 18 township 52 range 26 west
 of the 4 th meridian the improvements made by wright before his death consisted of ten acres of breaking with
 crop and fencing partially in each of the quarters forming the west half of the section and the walls of
 a house on one of the same quarters after wright s death a brother now in the mounted police at
 battleford was appointed administrator and was expected up about the 1 st of october to look after the place last
 week the walls of a house were put on one of the quarters close to wright s field by francis
 whitford for frank boisvert who arrived from oregon during the summer and who apparently intends to jump the claim now
 that the land is surveyed there is no excuse for claim jumping and the taking of the claim of a

 b hosie the little white school houses which were so prominent before the turn of the century and for a
 couple of decades after are fast going the way of the horse and buggy they belong to a past age
 but throughout western canada they once dotted the countryside from five to eight miles apart and were the centre of
 the community it was in these little white school houses where the rural children received their education with one teacher
 handling the grades from one to eight in the centre of the one roomed school was a pot bellied stove
 which provided the heat in winter while behind the teacher s desk on the platform was a large blackboard covering
 part of the wall a means of discipline was a heavy strap that the teacher kept in the top drawer
 of the desk and on one side of the wall hung a large clock the interior of the school was
 painted with rather a drab brown shade my parents william and adelaide parents were anxious we get an educa connors
 homesteaded in the potter tion creek district a few years after the turn of last century it was a rough

 teach at potat rimbey which was over four miles ter creek she was a tall woman around away so my
 father helped to organize six feet who wore long founced skirts what was known as potter creek school touching on
 the ground and her hair it was named after the first settler a done up in a knot on top
 of her head doctor who had come from north dakota she had come from the new england in 1903 and
 who lived by the creek dr states and was hard to get acquainted potter was not allowed to practice medi
 with a box social was held at the cine in canada and as his wife could not school to raise
 money to buy some extra stand the wilderness they returned to desks shortly after miss hall was hired north dakota
 after three years all communities held a box social in those days to raise money for any need the school
 was built for five hund ed cause so one was held in the potter red dollars and was opened in
 early creek school miss hall was a woman winter of 1908 the first teacher was nearing forty years of age
 and a young john craig who came from dundee man of around twenty had bought her scotland he had taught
 the potter box he apparently thought he was creek students for only a month when he buying his steady girl
 s box but it died from a heart attack and the school proved to be a disappointment to both closed
 for two months when miss hall saw who it was she went outside and hid in a clump of trees
 it was difficult in those days for tea and did not come in for the rest of the chers to
 get boarding places so it al evening the young man took the box ways fell to my mother s lot
 to board the back to the auctioneer in hopes his girl s teacher she boarded the teachers for box hadn
 t yet been sold but it was and three dollars a week which included she was eating lunch with his
 would be their laundry and mending there was rival really no money in it considering the work but if no
 one would board the after miss f hall left another teateacher the school would close and my cher came from
 london england he mrs hosie an alberta pioneer now lives at 1217 retaliack st regina 26 view of potter creek
 school five miles west of bimbey in 1908 the teacher at centre is florence hall was cheap and whenever he
 went away one reason my father stuck up for him for a weekend he would ask mother to but he
 wasn t much of a man for he was reduce his board bill which she always completely unappreciative of what
 my did many times he gave her only two parents did for him we lived a mile dollars for five
 days board and nothing from the school and always walked it extra for his washing or mending summer and winter
 but the teacher one woman who lived half a mile thought it was too far to walk so he from
 my parents took a great dislike to bought a slick black horse from an this teacher she had a family
 of six american civil war veteran who homechildren and she soon turned her chil stead north of the school this
 man dren against him one day when she thought a lot of the horse and always was passing the school
 she stuck her took good care of it as it was a head in the door while classes were on
 thoroughbred but as he was returning and shouted you are not fit to teach a to wisconsin he hoped whoever
 got the bunch of hogs never mind children horse would be good to it however it this uprooted the school
 for a little was a sad day for the horse when he while was sold to the teacher my father
 was secretary and trus he used to ride the horse to school tee at the time he went to this
 woman and would tie it to a post there the big and told her to stay out of the school
 boys would throw stones at it as they yard and not to interfere with the tea disliked the teacher and
 it seemed to cher however the trouble did not end ease their minds by taking revenge on there as two
 boys one noon grabbed his horse when they arrived back at hold of this teacher and took him to the
 my parents house my father had to creek and dumped him in luckily the feed the horse and my mother
 said the water wasn t deep and all the teacher teacher was incapable of looking after got was a good
 wetting my father went it the animal finally came to a sad to these boys parents and told them ending
 when the teacher didn t put the that if anything like this happened halter on straight and it lost an
 eye the again the boys would be expelled poor horse became a skeleton after that and finally ended up in
 being shot the the community seemed to be down teacher left after a couple of years and on that teacher
 and i think that was the settled in calgary 27 the next teacher that taught the different date as these
 used to be well potter creek schcol was from hamilton attended they would have a large ontario he took his
 politics very seri christmas tree on the platform and ously and i remember how he used to people would bring
 their gifts a prolecture to the higher grades at school on gramme was held first and the children the subject
 he kept good discipline in would sing and put on a dialogue the the school and one day when a
 couple of teachers generally arranged this with a boys started throwing water about he little outside help the ladies in
 the told them to stop when they didn t he community would bring cake or sandgot the strap out and
 gave them a real wiches while the people who came from licking and water throwing never oc other districts were
 not asked to bring cured again anything the children were all treated the rural school used to have two to
 a small bag of candy play grounds one side for the boys and these christmas trees were enjoythe other for
 the girls the boys used to able affairs for the old timers and the play fcotball and sometimes baseball children
 as it was a get together during noon hour and recess the girls where the parents would meet the teawould
 gather leaves and flowers and cher the chairman was some well press them between books as kind of known man
 in the community and while a hobby as well as a recreation the programme was on he would get up
 the school opened at 9 o clock in and interrupt it by saying he had just the morning with arithmetic
 lessons and got word that santa claus was arriving after recess we had geography in the the small children would
 sit with baited afternoon we had spelling and history breath as bells would ring outside soon lessons and sometimes composition
 a figure garbed in red appeared and children in those days were punished rushed to the platform he would bow
 for not getting their lessons correct one on one side of the platform and then rush form of punishment which
 was most em to the other side and bow again and barrassing for a child was to be sat up
 then he was away when he got outon the platform in full view of the other side he would ring
 the bell again and children and wearing a dunce cap was away to the small children it was the school
 inspector called once a a something that held mystery for them year and his report went to the secre those
 cold still winter nights had tary i remember one school inspector a certain fascination as the sleigh bells who was
 a very stout man he would could be heard for a mile away in those slip quietly into the school
 and walk to days young men especially had strings the platform sometimes before anyone of sleigh bells wrapped around their
 had time to notice him he had a gig horses and at these christmas trees as they used to call
 them something like you could hear the sounds of sleigh bells a high wheeled cart and a single horse coming
 from different directions with its tail braided up and tied with bright ribbon it was generally in the there was
 no stable at the school spring when he called and that was the so people had to tie their horses
 to the rainy time of the year so he probably fence and cover them with horse blanrode in this high
 wheeled cart so as to kets inside the school on these cold be sure of getting through the mud holes
 evenings there would be the aroma of in december there would be christ coffee as the ladies generally had the
 mas trees as they called them in those water boiling on top of the stove and days held in the
 schools each school coffee on the way ready when the prowould try to hold its christmas tree at a gramme
