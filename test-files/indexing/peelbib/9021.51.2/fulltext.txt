 our oxen irom their winnipeg for the further and as we hoped neighbors i regret to report that the sudden
 more golden west we had seen in each demand for caits had commercialized the successive summer hundreds and hundreds industry

 our ponies and loaded with buffalo robes way that in several instances the carts we wending their creaking way from

 dusky winnipeg we knew that the trade in robes and seemingly guileless native craftsmen was as much the backbone of
 commercial had been made to sell rather than to stand winnipeg in those years as that in beaver up under
 heavy loads on a long trip also that the vendors of the oxen seized what alberta history spring 2003 u

 been the other we took the camp fires while crossing the plain was qu appelle hill and after untold labor
 and taken on before leaving the hills there pains arrived with much delay on the plateau prepared to resume the
 were only two or three good watering comparatively even tenor of our way places in the 40 mile stretch which
 meant north westward that extra long drives had to be made between and even those watering places as we moved
 forward spy hill was on our were not to be relied upon right beyond the big cut arm creek was
 the long and beautiful stretch of the the lowest and therefore the most miry pheasant plains with the blue rise
 of the point on the plain was the crossing of the file hills across our front and the pheasant wolverine
 slough a stagnant alkali creek hills in the distance on our left the file that was the cause of immeasurable
 and not hills were merely rolling country with a always silent grief during wet seasons to greater percentage of poplar
 clumps or many worthy freighters and their always bluffs than where the surface was more patient but not always reliable
 motive level beyond the file hills was another power lanigan a railway junction point plain with poplar bluffs more thinly
 with its stores banks churches elevators scattered and then the big touchwood and all the equipment of a modern city
 is hills these were higher than the file about three miles from the crossing of this hills there were more
 of them and both slough of utter despond if any of the bluffs and ponds were larger but the freighters
 who wended weary way across pioneers who had laid out the cart trail the big salt plain in the season
 of 1876 or were engineers by instinct the trail wound in the immediately succeeding years had among the hills and
 around the ponds been asked to choose between locating in called sloughs always taking absolutely the hills or on the
 plain my guess is that the best grade available so that the hills 100 per cent would have chosen the
 hills were no impediment to the movement of and if their choice had been restricted to the freight judged by
 the map the main line of plain i venture the belief that the site of the the canadian national must
 be almost on future town of lanigan would not have been the old cart trail all the way between spy
 among the selections this is one of the hill and touchwood station many instances which show that the pioneer oliver
 met a cavalcade of metis who has the pick of the counti y frequently hunters using carts of this type
 beyond touchwood hudson s bay post the if not generally overlooks the best bet sketched near pembina in 1858 trail
 took a slightly more northerly course and in about a day s travel from the post we reached the edge
 of hills and looked out on the big salt plain ‘‘ salt in this case meant alkali this was our
 first glimpse of the entirely treeless prairie which stretched westward broken only by river valleys ‘nearly to the foothills of
 the rockies in all ‘ ‘ the country we had come through we had never been out of sight or
 reach of wood p ‘ but here was a stretch of 40 miles from the touchwood hills to humboldt telegraph
 office absolutely without wood and in dry seasons such as that of 1876 very scarce of good water the surface
 was level there were some alkali ponds and what was ‘ alberta history spring 2003 humboldt office on the telegraph
 line and we of course reciprocated to the best of our surveyed railway route was at the northerly ability and
 the crossing was made safely limit of the salt plain it was about six and without serious delay but so
 far as miles westerly from the present railway friend gabriel was concerned we might town of humboldt the trails to
 the have been there yet batoche and gabriel dumont ferries on the south branch forked there both had duck shortly
 after making the crossing and lake and carlton as their objectives but reaching the plateau level the new and the
 battleford traffic took the gabriel trail lightly marked battleford trail turned because it was materially the shortest not sharply westward
 away from that to duck touching duck lake the ferries were lake and carlton i recall that as we made
 about four miles apart our first spell or noon camp in the country of the great saskatchewan history concedes that
 dumont was a alongside a fresh water slough we saw in capable military leader in 1885 but the distance a
 pair of white cranes the protected by time and distance i make bold rarest the largest the most beautiful and
 to say that in 1876 he was a rotten the most elusive of all prairie fowl on ferryman his idea
 of operating a ferry was looking over the map i conclude that where to provide a scow scarcely large enough
 to the cranes found the solitude and safety carry four loaded carts without the oxen that were a first necessity
 of existence to equip it with four sweeps and a long tow them is now located the thriving town of
 rope collect the ferry toll retire to his rosthern bungalow on the brow of the hill and let matters take
 their course the reader may in due course after leaving the south wonder how it was that under such branch
 we struck the trail from carlton to conditions his scow was not allowed by the elbow the trail was deeply
 marked it same aggrieved freighter to simply drift was the route by which the hunters from the down stream the
 reason was that if a batoche duck lake and prince albert freighter had been so unfortunate as to let settlements
 reached the buffalo herds of the scow escape friend gabriel would have the great plains westerly and southwesterly called on
 the mounted police at carlton between the battle and red deer rivers at and the freighter would have had to
 pay for the elbow the new trail to the new capital it there was of course no ferry cable the
 forked to the right and turning scow was rowed across by the use of the northwesterly followed the telegraph line
 four sweeps necessarily it was carried a between the eagle hills and the river as long way down stream by
 the swift current there were many small streams coming after the carts were pushed off by hand the down from
 the hills to the river there were scow had to be towed up stream far enough many steep little valleys
 to cross which so that allowing for its being swept down made difficult going for ox trains we had stream
 again it would reach the shore been told to take another trail which forking where the rest of the carts
 were standing westward from the river trail went around waiting to be pushed also by hand oxen or the hills
 and so avoid these inconvenient horses had to swim the river a party of valleys only two such as my
 partner and me could not by any possibility have got our the elbow was a general camping ground outfit across
 the river by gabriel s ferry it was the first point on their homeward fortunately a party of french half

 railway a new trail after leaving an old camp ground does not become well defined for some distance when we
 left the elbow camp giound we did not notice the battleford tmaml turning off to the right so we followed
 the wcll in irked huntems tiail southwesterly and soon crossed the ‘telegraph line that went direct from humboldt to battleford
 we crossed eagle ci eek by a not difficult crossing and shortly ‘ ‘ entered the higher country and rolling
 hillb ‘ ‘ ‘ which lie between perdue and biggar on e c the c in idi in picilmc and

 the we traversed even in the thuchwood hills of buffalo hunters on eagle case of the touchwood hills the grades
 was seldom if ever as much as six inches in river west of the present city of diameter and generally
 very much less saskatoon it was sketched wei e easy there was plenty of grass and d sufficient water but
 no wood save a little what had killed the forest after its having et milton cheadle bi ush on the
 banks of the ponds the hills attained the growth that we saw was as were stony on their tops and
 the only thing gm eat a mystery as the growth itself the to be seen from the highest of them
 was standing trees showed no signs of having still more rolinded hills also with stony been injured by fire we
 heard afterwards tops to my partner and inc the region that there were indian legends which gave seemed to us
 to realize that expressive supernatural accounting for the destruction phrase the abomination of desolation of the forest and possibly for
 its growth as 01 course the fact that by this time we had well but we never learned the particulars
 begun to think that we were lost did not aid we only knew that its name was the ghost us
 in a favorable estimate of the outlook woods i recall that as we reached the edge of the woods there
 was a human skull after travelling the hills for what seemed a hanging on a limb of brush close to
 the long time the country became more level trail water and wood were more scarce but we still got sufficient
 to carry on with possibly a couple of days after leaving the comfortably one morning when several ghost woods the
 trail passed along the days out from eagle creek we saw on our north side of a somewhat sandy ridge
 on left front standing out of the naked plain a which grew some small brush in the side dead forest
 of large poplar trees the bark of the ridge was a spring of good water had been stripped off these
 trees were here we saw the first direct evidence that somewhat scattered and there was no young we were in
 the buffalo country there had growth between the tree growth occupied been a considerable kill in the vicinity rising and
 sandy ground the trail passed heads and other debris of the hunt were through its northern tip scattered about profusely
 that the kill had been recent was shown by the condition of how far that forest extended south we did
 the refuse we made camp that night on the not know how trees of that size could have east side
 of a low ridge which lay across grown in that locality was a mystery for the the trail when the
 dark had closed down alberta history spring 2003 run discredited either horse or rider or possibly both as the pmoccssmon
 moved ‘ forward the hunters topped every rise in advance on the lookout for buffalo and to i see before
 being seen by them following were the covered carts in which the wives of the hunters travelled with their young
 ‘ children and hommsehold belongings then came the empty freight carts which were to bring back the product of the
 hunt fresh meat dried meat or pemmican and hides or robes as the case might be larger children i ode
 in them half grown boys and girls were on horseback spread out or either side of the carts and capeming
 their horses over train of metis carts en route to we heard the hark of doe 5 and the sound
 of the prairie in great delight as they drove the red river in 1858 the indian drum beyond mime ridge

 is usual to the half breeds ol the party owned the best make an early start and if the days
 are long horses and most of the carts the indians to make two stops in the day instead of one
 preferred the travoms to the cart as a mneans oxen move slowly and as their working of transport a horse
 equipped with a power comes only from the grass they eat travoms could not haul as much as one they
 must have plenty of tmmne for grazing attached to cart blmt he could haul much between spells of work more
 than he could carry as a pack and colmld move over the prairie without regard as always we pulled out
 bright and early to trails much more qlmmckly than either the and soon the trail passed through a camp of
 cam t or the pack horse the travoms was an hunters no doubt those who had made the arrangement by
 which two light poles kill the remains of which we had seen rested at one end on the horse while
 the there were 20 to 30 leather tepees possibly other ends trailed on the ground behind a three times as
 many carts and dogs galore light framework behind the horse kept the with horses grazing on the prairie in the
 poles a fixed distance apart and carried the distance only the dogs expressed curiosity load only ponies were used by
 the buffalo or possibly derision as we passed slowly by hunters on their mnovenients on the plains a couple of
 hours later the cavalcade of the grass was green the sky blue the sun hunters and carts ponies and dogs

 picture was vividly impressed this was the life these weme the aristocrats of on my mind i wish i commld
 transfer it as the prairie but in a few years the buffalo had vividly to print but that is impossible

 to their own standards of life had buffalo runners horses qualified by been reduced to litter and abject poverty strength
 speed and endurance to catch and stay with the buffalo herd long enough the extinction of the buffalo was an
