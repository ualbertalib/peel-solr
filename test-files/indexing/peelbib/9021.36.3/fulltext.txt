 a formal enquiry the depression had created a by 1930 eighty one men were employed on the paranoia among some
 citizens of edmonton of force using the motto to be the best it heightened criminal activity particularly due to proved
 to be one of the most progressive of all the unemployed and the large number of transients moving through the
 city as well a civic election growing up on a farm near rivercourse alberta held in november of 1930 brought
 the problems marion johnson has always had an intense interest of policing to even greater public attention in fact in

 edmonton at the onset of the depression the glowing all other major western canadian cities were record of achievement of
 the edmonton police experiencing a similar pattern of criminal activity department appeared to become tarnished un during the depression chief
 constable a g favourable economic conditions fueled concern shute stated that current crime is just as bad in that edmonton
 was experiencing a serious increase other western cities as it is in edmonton and this in crime which the police
 were both ill equipped city is not an isolated case 8 and ill prepared to meet the edmonton bulletin edmonton
 s force however was the only carried daily reports of crimes prosecuted through municipal police department to come under he
 po lice court indicating just how seriously the strident criticism and be blamed for not coping depression had affected the
 city assault cases with the crime wave the demand for greater a nd thefts were numerous and youths seemed the
 efficiency to meet the growing criminal activity most frequent offenders came not only from the press but also from the
 for example three city youths were charged city politicians when a civic election was anwith holding up and robbing a
 city streetcar while nounced for november 12 th candidates sprang masked and armed with guns 2 another youth to exploit
 the allegations of police corruption and was charged with the armed holdup of a south side inefficiency butcher store 3
 from manitoba came news of the former mayor griesbach had predicted this conviction of an ex constable from edmonton in
 type of politicking in a draft report on municipal the shooting death of a woman after a drinking police written
 in 1928 he felt that as long as the spree 4 on november 6 1930 the bulletin head police were
 under direct control of a city council lines proclaimed wave of crime continues the councillors were usua lly deficient in
 matters with no abatement citizens complain to mayor pertaining to law enforcement and men who are douglas demanding remedy â€˜
 elected will invariably be guided by public sen was there really an increase in criminal activity timent 9 he further
 perceived it a serious during this period the queston is a difficult one detriment to the efficiency of the policel
 that to answer certainly the economic situation seems law enforcement is not taken very seriously until to have triggered the
 enforcement of specific crime has become rampant offences for example railway police arrested some members of city council were calling
 for many people for sleeping in rail cars 6 although an investigation into police affairs some months this crime may
 have been inconsequential the prior to the election they had hinted that they arrests were meant to control the number
 of ti an did not think all was well with the police adminissients who were considered a potential criminal tration
 and suggested that an investigation element might be desirable although the political and any increase in the number of other
 offences social climate had been cool to the original idea is hard to analyze there may have been more the
 crime wave in october and november occurrences of crime as people were foited to turn created conditions more favourable to
 the sugto illegal means of survival on the other hand gestion criminal activities may have been amplified by the as
 police commissioner mayor j c douglas press thus heightening public awareness of the deemed it was necessary for him to
 take some crime situation certainly the public peiteived that course of action although he was not being a problem existed
 and this led them to suspect challenged for the seat of mayor he appear ed accountable for inefficiency within the
 force and the spark of discontent and lack of confidence moved to answer the criticisms only six days by the
 public in the police department is growing prior to the election he publicly threatened chief in the opinion of the
 city commissioners who are shute with a drastic reorganization of the depart now demanding action 4 ment if the administration
 could not cope with the dr fred a keillor an incumbent alderman cr ime situation in a letter to the
 chief he called was one of those who initiated the idea of an for immediate action and strong measur es
 investigation long before the election even threats but r efr ained fr om specifying what these should that he would
 be defeated at the polls if he did be 2 not lay off the police department did not deter the
 bulletin rose in mild defence of shute him the warnings made by an unspecified protesting that some onus for policing
 pr oblems person may have actually improved keillor s lay with the council chief shute has repeatedly campaign making him
 appear a champion of the asked for mor e men to carry out patrol work and citizenry whether the threats
 were legitimate or investigations said the newspaper but the not keillor declared that n elected representaeconomy wave which has been
 in vogue at city tive of the citizens had the right to insist on hall for some year s past
 has resulted in these efficiency of the police force in order to secure applications being turned down 3 the best
 possible protection for the citizens 5 the mayor was not the only politician to raise he also announced his intent
 to continue his the problems of the police administration during criticisms until efficiency was established the civic election campaign in
 fact the topic keillor was returned as the top aldermanic canbecame popular among aldermen and according didate at the civic
 election surpassing his near est to the bulletin opponent c l gibbs by 247 votes the count fanned into a
 flame by the current crime wave being 7 136 to 6 889 16 undoubtedly part of an example of the
 crime wave which struck edmonton late in 1929 occurred in the downtown area a waitress at the king edward hotel
 agnes allen was shot and killed by her assailant on october 28 the man whose alias was william montgomery then
 shot himself earlier the waitress had asked chief shute for protection and the police had warned montgomery to leave the
 woman alone above the police are at the scene of the murder keillor s success may be attributed to his
 persistent problem in the force in this way he attempted attack on police inefficiency while his outspoken to placate council
 and the public ness contributed to his large victory unlike mayor despite the suggestions aldermen maintained douglas he did not
 allow the matter to rest and that an investigation into police affairs was necesrefused to endorse the mayor s election
 day com sary and plans for the enquiry were finalized at ment that it did appear as though the crime
 wave the first meeting of the new city council investiwas being successfully combatted at present 7 gation into the efficiency
 of the city police would rather keillor continued to press for an inde focus on the physical condition of the
 men and pendent probe accepting the large vote as his amount of police training given them as well as mndate
 8 his charges against the police depart the efficiency of the force and co operation ment were straightforward while he
 considered between men and officers the last detail remain chief shute and his personnel to be absolutely ing was the
 appointment of a qualified man to honest men 9 he complained of inefficiency and head the enquiry of a lack
 of harmony between the men and officers on november 29 mayor douglas announced of the department 2 he believed that
 the depart that major general william a griesbach had ment was more like a mexican army than any consented to
 take on responsibility for conducting thing else all offices it is top heavy we need the enquiry he proved to
 be a popular choice more men patrolling the such criticism the bulletin commenting was punctuated by incidents from the recent
 crime griesbachj stands high in the esteem of his felwave for example keillor learned that a store low townsfolk he
 is to the manor born had been r obbed one night and then again the in police matters he inherits
 the fine traditions following night despite placement of two police which have made the r n w m p the
 pride of officer s on surveillance 22 canada public sentiment was swayed both by the city griesbach s father had
 been a member of the newspapers and the council in favour of an inves nwmp since its inception and griesbach
 himself tigation the issue of ineffiency was widely had had an extensive military career serving in supported as was the
 assessment of top heavy the boer war and world war one in the l 920 s organization particularly because it
 suggested a he studied policing in western canada and drafted r elatively simple solution fewer officer s more various articles
 on the subject including men on the beats hence less crime municipa l police and policing alberta for chief shute
 there were no easy answers to in addition to this background in policing he the criticisms concerned with maintaining a
 had legal training and experience in politics favourable public image and meeting the demands during the federal election in 1905
 griesbach was of city hail he began a crusade to impr ove the defeated when he ran against the formidable
 department he started by assigning extra duty for liberal frank oliver he also had experience as the city police and
 decreasing office details to an a lderman and in 1907 had become edmonton s incr ease men on the beat
 as a measur e to combat youngest mayor these experiences familiarized crime 23 he then offered that griesbach with various
 difficulties in the governcruiser cars equippe d with sawed off shotguns ment and administration of the police force and revolvers
 and wireless receiving apparatus griesbach enquiy was well organized and so that they can be in touch with police head

 and issued to mayor s and chief answers to the solution of edmonton s crime constables of other major western
 cities namely wave winnipeg regina saskatoon calgar y van in shute s view problems in administration and couver and victoria
 by doing so he attempted the resultant inefficiency stemmed from city hall to obtain comparative data on which to analyze
 withholding adequate funding shute treated the edmonton police department the next step demands for an enquiy as though they were
 was to invite individual members of the force to directed towards a solution of the immediate crime confidentially submit complaints
 or suggestions problem and not an indication of any general his third move was to hold public hearings which edmonton

 that a number of the older men charge of police corruption was made george g be got rid of to
 make room in the force for younger men 4 seven men already had been policing and to move toward a
 modernized force mandatorily retired as of december 31 1930 he believed the old requirements bred mediocrity griesbach also investigated the
 allegation that in the force the edmonton police department was like a mediocrity therefore in physical fitness and in mexican
 army with something like thirty four intellectual capacity is one of the factors which officers out of eighty men â€˜
 42 this figure proved militates against efficiency of your police to be inaccurate of a total force of eighty one
 force 47 only six or 7 4 percent were officers except for there also was a problem in the detective
 unit winnipeg which had 13 04 percent officers his the commissioner described the detectives as figure was close to the
 ratios for other cities lacking in sufficient education youth and what griesbach s analysis of population and area is commonly
 called pep it is impossible for revealed that the ratio of police to population was them to look like anything
 but promoted policesimilar to other cities but edmonton was under men and an intelligent criminal could spot them policed on
 the basis of area as griesbach had at 200 yards and immediately go elsewhere noted earlier edmonton was under policed
 due new qualifications were recommended for to its excessive area and cosmopolitan popula recruiting a more modem police force rather

 required to improve efficiency in po licing fat and slow 49 as they got older leaner lighter the metropolis men

 s report was lauded for its com 1931 the press heralded the results griesbach prehensiveness it touched many aspects of
 the finds city police force 70 efficient no cor police force 5 one problem particularly shocked ruptibility is found by
 investigator but slackness the investigator he had read thirty constables abounds the enquiy disclosed no form of notebooks found most
 of them to be ifiegible and actual wrong doing in the department but gries discovered one fellow who had written
 up his bach noted the pr esence of much ignor ance of book four days in advance noting visits by
 the police duties dullness and car elessness on the inspector and patrol sergeant 5 although a cerpart of the force

 police work any reliability of in the report to begin griesbach advocated the the information would certainly be open to
 quesimmediate r etir ement of eight men based on age tion if a report had been written four days ahead
 poor physical fitness and past usefulness to griesbach suggested the men s notebooks be counter this retirement he suggested the
 immediate checked by an officer to increase their accuracy establishment of a pension scheme so that men and efficiency would
 be given consideration for years of service further improvement was suggested in the eduand so that the right type of
 man would be induced cation of the force the commissioner advocated to enter police work as a vocation frequent lectures
 on various legal topics and related to this griesbach found that qualifica enrollment in university level courses a prelimitions for
 admittance to the police force were not nary training period revolver practice and conhigh enough tinued drill exercises were regarded
 as necessar y for the past twenty years it would appear that for effective police work as well griesbach was

 roughly to weigh in the serve as a handbook for all men on the force the neighborhood of 180 pounds
 and to be able to only book in existence had been written in 1909 read and wnte and do simple

 a new manual in an earlier time griesbach recognized the grow would set out instructions in police procedure ing need
 for edmonton to advance its system of conduct duties rules and regulations in his investigation w a griesbach criticised edmonton
 detectives for lacking in education youth and pep he noted that an intelligent criminal could spot them at 200 yards
 above is the complement of city detectives a few months before the investigation the report also suggested periodic review of

 taken 53 use of po lice discretion and the influence it is idle to say that the union has not
 greatly of prominent people in the community harmed the interfered or that the intervention of the union integrity of the
 force to counteract this the has not resulted in any specified instance of formation of a police commission was recom
 resulting inefficiency or lack of discipline the mended to protect the chief constable and police fact of the matter is
 that a union exists that it men from the interference of citizens members has intervened between the chief constable and
 of the commission would include the mayor the governing body and that behind such intervention looms the menace of the
 stnke 55 police magistrate and a senior district court justice this combination would take into con the city had entered
 into an agreement with the sideration both the budget of city hall and the edmonton civic employees federation including requirements
 of law enforcement to supplement local 74 the city of edmonton policemen s the commission griesbach suggested the imme association

 outside the force a man with administrative interference of the union in promotions and in disexperience education brains and capacity

 the force ineffective chief constable and his duties would include the alberta labor news voice of the alberta responsibility for
 organization of the force federation of labor vehemently objected to one segment of griesbach s findings was griesbach s entire
 report extremely controversial he reported that the with one exception there is nothing of imporpolice union interfered with the efficiency
 of the tance that is new in the report of general griesforce by curtailing and abridging the authority of bach
 on his investigation of he edmonton po lice the chief and should be abolished griesbach s force the fact that
 the newspapers headlined the section recommending abolition of the police not pleased in a letter written to the partner of
 men s union is a pretty good indication of the his law firm he said real purpose behind the investigation
 a careful review cannot but bring to mind the i am bound to say that i was surprised when i
 comment that the mountain labored and heard that popple had been appointed to his brought forth a mouse present office
 he may be a good man but he would not have been my choice generally speaking griesbach found the he
 further complained of popple s inadequacies police to be an honest force no evidence had in carrying out the recommendations
 been presented to support the innuendos of bribery the police regulations prepared by popple are a nd corruption chief shute
 emerged as an honest very badly done one visualizes this production man and the cominissioner hesitated to lay respon as

 grade eight educations scattered griesbach pointed out that shute was neither a throughout canada briefly i have a very poor
 strong man in the department nor was he in control opinion of the draft 6 of the force however griesbach
 was receptive to popple s the bulletin viewed the enquiy as request for help in revising the copy and through
 thorough and comprehensive the report of the his assistance it reached a final state acceptable commissioner is exhaustive and he
 has brought to the parties involved toget her a vast amount of information on police on the whole griesbach was
 extremely critical matters which will be permanently useful of city council s attitude to the suggestions he had having called
 for an investigation it is to be sup made he wrote to his law partner posed the city council will
 take prompt steps to it would appear that the council have carried out put the recommendations of the commissioner my
 recommendations to some extent in the most into effect and thus bring the force up to grudging awkward and reluctant
 manner i need standard not stress further my disapproval of the course such confidence in city hall proved to be
 mis that they have followed 6 placed as council members hesitated to enact most but in the long run at
 least some of his places of griesbach s measur es some recommendations were utilized were not perceived as expedient particularly
 the abolition of the union another factor preventing the changes made as a result of the investigation implementation of the
 recommendations may have were important in the evolution of the edmonton been cost city hall operating with a deficit police
 department although other influences budget during the depression could ill afford later shaped the police the investigation in 1931 comprehensive

 sweden to visit their friends and promote canadian immigration interests several leading canadian papers have r ecently published paragraphs stating
 that the governments of sweden and germany strongly object to canadian agents working in those countries in the interest of
 emigration so far as sweden is concerned the statement is denied by gentlemen who are familiar with the facts it
 is stated that while only licensed agents are allowed to sell tickets there is no other restriction anyone may insert
 in the newspapers notices of meetings and hold such meetings on reporting to the chief of police to whom all

 yesterday afternoon was decidedly unpleasant for a few hours about noon it commenced raining and in a few minutes the
 rain changed to wet snow which driven by the high wind rendered travelling on the prairie exceedingly difficult and dangerous
 work the storm was even worse out to the west than at lethbridge about ten o oclock the old veteran
 stage drive polly started out from macleod with his coach well filled with eight passengers it was raining at the
 time but when he got on the big hill the storm of wind and snow struck the party overturning the
 coach and lifting pollinger out of the seat but you bet your life i held on to the strings he
 remarked when describing the adventure the coach was again righted and the driver with the assistance of the passengers who
 did not relish the prospect of spending the night on the prairie managed to reach the house of mr a
 j whitney where they put up for the night reaching lethbridge about ten this morning considerable anxiety was felt in
 town for the safety of the party but it was thought that if any man in the country could bring
 them through safely that man was pollinger the police however started out this morning in search but had only gone
 a short distance from town when they saw the broad smiling face of pollinger bobbing up ser enely in his

 the issues of suffrage immigra not view the right to vote on an equal basis with tion and women and
 children were prominent men as essential rather the activities which areas of attention in addition concern over the members did

 edmonton and concern over the growing number of immi local council of women elcw and the grants amply illustrate this
 contention westward ho chapter of the imperial order of daughters of the empire lode elise schneider graduated fmm ihc university

 one of the many women s patriotic suffrage was not an issue for either organization organizations in edmonton presents a
 flag to major although some individual members undoubtedly frank fane before his unit went overseas in world war one were
 in favour of the idea an examination of attitudes and activities position with the westward ho chapter of lode regarding
 these issues leads to the conclusion that in 1913 almost without exception the women they were derived more from the
 fact of the of both groups were married a number of their women s membership within the middle class than
 husbands were professionals working in the fields from an identification with gender in other words of medicine university teaching and
 politics 9 the women in the edmonton groups were not in the years leading up the granting of equal feminists
 in the sense that they desired full eco franchise to women it is significant that neither nomic and political equality
 with men rather the local council nor the westward ho chapter they accepted society s definition of the woman s
 of lode considered suffrage as issue some mdiplace and merely sought to extend their traditional vidual members were in favor
 of votes for roles into the public domain women but the movement was not supported westward ho was the first
 chapter of the lode by either organization as a whole in alberta formed in edmonton in 1905 like the in
 fact the subject was for the most part not lode nationally it was a patriotic organization mentioned in the minute
 books of the two groups the chapter concerned itself with such activities except in a few instances as late as
 1914 the as procuring flags for the use of schools and hold westward ho chapter voted against the appointing an
 essay writing contest for school children ment of a standing committee on franchise for on a patriotic theme 2 most
 notable however women in the same year a member of the was their work during world war one the local
 local council opposed a committee on franchise chapter in edmonton immediately assumed res considering it unnecessary since the equal franponsibility
 to assist needy families of soldiers by chise league of edmonton and district had been supplying donations of food and
 money 3 formed 2 likewise lady aberdeen dispelled the lode in general aided both the families misconceptions federally about the
 national counof men overseas as well as sick and wounded cil of women being a suffrage society by stating soldiers
 and men engaged in combat specifically at the first annual meeting that council was not these women provided clothing for
 soldier s sup dedicated to any one propaganda and that its aim plies for the red cross and hospitals raised
 was simply â€˜ mothering 3 money for ambulances machine guns and books he subject was however debated at a canadafor
 men at the front as well as aid for their wives wide meeting of the national council in 1910 at
 home 4 equal voting rights were at first objected to on the edmonton local council of women was technical grounds
 4 the resolution was passed affiliated with the larger national organization the the next day by a vote of 71
 to 51 even though national council of women of canada unlike several representatives of local councils argued the lode the
 council s main focus was the eco that many of their members were against it 5 nomic and social problems
 of women 5 evidently the national council along with the edmonton local council of women while numerous affiliated societies came
 to endorse not as active in war work as the lode seemed suffrage somewhat reluctantly to have accomplished more for
 women and chil the relative lack of concern over suffrage as dren locally in their first year of operation in
 an issue for the local council and the lode can 1908 they set up committees on public health be interpreted
 as a reinforcement of these women s laws for the better protection of women and chil belief in their traditional
 role they considered the dren and free employment 6 although the focus right to vote on an equal basis with
 men largely of both groups differed somewhat they seemed unnecessary lady taylor president of the to have held the same
 views on important issues national council used the argument that male and in some cases even collaborated on the form
 suffrage was not successful because in the west ing of petitions the foreigners could be bought for a dollar and
 fur ther many women belonged to both groups if the men could be bought for a dollar their wives mrs
 annie bulyea for example wife of the could be bought for fifty cents 6 she concluded lieutenant governor 7 was
 the honorary president that while english women might need the vote of the local council in 1908 and held the
 same canadian women did not women instead they directed some of their most important activities towards improving conditions for women
 and children which can be seen as an extension of the maternal role specifically the local council undertook work in
 the interests of women and children in a variety of ways the committee on laws for the better protection of
 women and children was concerned with dower rights for widows 20 and homesteading rights for women council s efforts on
 the latter question involved their support for a petition from the national council advocating homesteading for women of british birth
 who had resided in canada for one year 2 on the loca l level the local council set up a
 day nursery for children of working women which could be used as a permanent shelter for neglected or illbred children
 22 in its first six months of the program the local council leased a house to provide care for nine
 children during the day and three both day and night the house also contained a women s free employment bureau
 the lode achieved nothing comparable for women and children locally however as early as august 18 1914 the westward ho
 chapter held emergency meetings to consider urgent cases of distress among soldier s wives 24 the chapter loaned 80 to
 one wife to help her go to england where she could earn a living with the reasoning that she would
 be a charge on the chapter mrs j v h bulyea wife of alberta s first lieutenangovernor was honorary chairman
 of both the local lode and local council of women she is seen here on the grounds of government house
 in 1915 other reports on the subject confirm that canadian women in general were not interested in obtaining the vote
 at that time the canadian annual review in 1909 stated that suffrage was practically a new issue to canadians 7
 in 1913 the president of a college women s society introduced a speaker with the statement i heard her on
 woman suffrage and she even made a subject like that in which so few of us are interested very entertaining
 the preponderance of middle and upper middle class women in edmonton within the local council and the lode can explain
 their lack of desir e for the franchise speaking of middle class club women in other parts of canada one
 writer noted that they had the leisure time to pursue activities apart from caring for their own children and turned
 their attention to social welfare causes 9 this aspect of middle class women s lives can be seen to apply
 to the women in edmonton the important point is that their leisure time was not spent in working toward political
 or sexual equality for anyway a report from the municipal chapter in december 1914 is a lso representative of the
 lode s concern for women and children and stated that 38 families were being provided for within edmonton the westward
 ho chapter made suggestions as to pr ojects which could be undertaken in the interests of young girls concern for
 young immigrant girls led to the suggestion of a club room for homeless and foreign girls some members were concerned
 about the proper conduct of these girls and protested to the city that they not be allowed to sell daily
 papers to the public 28 they also did not think it proper for these homeless girls to work in hotels
 and urged a petition on the subject to the superintendent of moral reform the victorian background of the lode members
 was responsible in part for their concern over the sexual morality of young foreign girls in the instances cited there
 seemed to be anxiety for the consequences of contact between the un lode the issue was also of national importance
 protected young girls and the public of course due to an increase of nearly two million people with the increasing
 urbanization and industrializa in the country s population from 1901 to 1911 tion of the period more young women than
 ever over one million of whom settled in the three before were engaged in work outside the home prairie provinces

 scarce in fact the beaver house chapter of the lode addressed the problem by providing fare while the demand for
 immigrants generally infrom liverpool for prospective servants which the eluded farmers farm labourers railway workers girls wer e to repay
 out of their first six months and domestic servants 36 a significant number of wages new arrivals sought permanent employment
 in the whole question of immigration was a matter urban centres 37 in the decade from 1901 to of great
 interest for the local council and the 1911 the populations of calgary and edmonton ji one of the edmonton women
 who belonged to the local organizations but still supported the franchise was nellie mcclung she is seen here at right

 doubtful areas such as housing water supply and sewage sympathy with the allied cause presented a disposal 38 these factors
 combined to produce grave danger to canada s success in the war serious health hazards which were said to have
 the municipal chapter of lode also came out caused more deaths in canada than world war against countries at war
 with canada by setting one up an anti german and austrian league and the r elationship between immigration and urban
 advocating a boycott of all products from social problems was therefore an understandable germany concern for urban women s organizations
 the while the lode s bias against germans and local council advocated the use of science to austrians likely came
 about as a direct result of determine the desirability of particular immigrants the war they possessed a general intolerance of

 institutional two women s groups concluded response to urban social problems was very comthat negmes and whites cannot live in

 an important means of assilessness and the development of bitter race milating immigrant children other reforms enhatred 43 dorsed by
 women s groups in edmonton involving by woodsworth s own account in 1909 there an institutional solution included for example

 fact that the local council and lode canada was virtually non existent many canadians members were part of the middle

 the consequences of carol bacchi emphasizes the class membership of allowing such r acially different groups into the the women

 further by altogether stating that the interests of their social religious the westward ho chapter of lode specifically and ethnic

 city during world war the suffr agists were predominantly members one 46 in a resolution to the dominion and of
 an anglo saxon protestant social elite provincial governments and edmonton city dominated by pr ofessionals and the wives of council
 they expressed the fear that germans and professionals who endorsed woman suffrage as among the many patriotic projects supported by
 the lode and other groups was raising money for belgian relief funds enabled the organizations to buy food such as

 edmonton a parallel can the achievements of both groups especially in be made between the relative importance of sex the
 area of work for women and children conand class for both canadian suffragists and the tributed to the advancement of
 women in general local members in edmonton in the period under although r aising he status of women seems not
 discussion the movement for equal voting rights to have been heir primary intention their endeawas not a focus for he
 two local women s groups yours outside the home definitely had this effect they like most canadians saw their role
 within the local council s concern for homesteading the home and family as their most important and dower rights for
 working women and the care function this belief was shared by the dominant of their children and the lode s
 implicit assumpsociety in which it was also unpopular for women tion of responsibility for the maintenance of needy to demand
 sexual equality members of the local families during the war are examples of the ways groups in edmonton therefore provided
 little in in which the women members found expression the way of support for women and their issues for their
 maternal qualities in the public sphere this point is r einfor ced by the conclusions of they were not questioning
 their role within the the feminist historian lynne teather she notes home and family but rather he fact of their
 being that while groups such as the lode took some married and middle class allowed sufficient free constructive actions for
 women without woman time for the pursuit of activities outside the home suffrage as an issue these groups each worked

 and menta l change for women 55 lode members as well as for many canadians in summary he members of
 the local council at the time they accepted the common view that and the westward ho chapter of lode addressed
 northern races and civilizations were superior to issues which were significant to most canadians southern 56 for this reason and

 p xii 54 ibid p 149 kiondikers lesser slave lake the snow is everywhere in this country and has been
 for weeks the water in the lakes disappeared in late november and the entire population outside of a few okemous
 and a favored missionary or two are back to that fare of all fares spuds whitefish may the lake never
 cease to nourish them the geese and ducks have passed south to a warmer clime and a few r oving
 klondiker s heading in the same direction have concluded to stay with us during the winter our warm reception and
 the temperature of local diversion was too congenial to resist it savors of home is the way one man put
 it and the chance to purchase the ever saleable cigarette made another feel like an english gentleman despite his ragged
 raiment and a body that had not been in touch with water for months so much for our r eputation
 fr om the roving kjondikers standpoint there may be little in it that reflects cr edit in the eyes of
 an outsider but to a slave laker it means much these men have been up against a hard hard game
 from the outskirts of edmonton to wherever their unbroken bronchos saw fit to steer them they passed here as they
 were going north and gave us the gobye on account as their actions spoke of a superior clay that was
 used in their construction they thought us indians no doubt and perhaps we acted like such we however meant them
 no harm and took no offense their appreciation of our hospita lity now is flattering to say the least as
 yet we cannot say we have noticed any change in local manners and when we sit down to our daily
 fish with our guests outside of their appetites we cannot see much differ ence between us they can tell us
 how to trade of cour se how to hunt and other accomplishments that only a klondiker knows anything about but
 that is natural of course they have travelled so far and under different circumstances for instance there is an englishman
 across the bay who left england six years ago came over in a boat the name of which i forget
 though i have heard him tell it fifty times and arrived in a big town down on the atlantic coast
 he lived a fast heat so he says so he finally lost his reckoning and drifted with the tide towards
 the golden north he can tell you the name of every town of importance ever y railway division and even
 down to the water tanks on the different roads that form the connection between edmonton and the eastern coast he
 got himself tangled up with a party of gold enthusiasts at edmonton and they started for slave lake peace river
 and any place north and west of that they had more than their share of adventures they all claim this
 as far as they went and that was up the nelson to a point where no white man had ever
 been before there he wintered got back to st john in the spring drifted down the peace on a raft
 to the crossing and came over the portage with a freighter built a shack and laid in a stock of
 potatoes and whitefish got some firewood and started in to be sociable with the natives falls into their easy agreeable
 way of living takes in all the tea dances picked up a little cree got a scarf to hold his
 trousers in place wear s moccasins and a stetson hat got his hair cut decent wear s a moose skin
 coat and german socks and before the winter is over if he has luck will gather in a team of
 bronchos in some way or other dig up an abandoned pair of bob sleighs left by a fellow kiondiker with
 less grit and will some day drive into edmonton for a load of freight and hen all who care to
 read the register and who don t will learn what we are like and where we come from edmonton bulletin

 dent rather than a licensed medical doctor during of coalbanks or in its successor the prairie level that time town
 of lethbridge he was never referred to in byers name appeared on a may 17 1884 the macleod gazette or
 in the lethbridge news 4 petition from employees of the lethbridge one r eason byers is so little remembered is
 that collieries and other residents of the hamlet of he was without formal qualifications while in coalbanks asking the dominion
 government to lethbridge to practice as a medica l doctor he had establish a post office in the riverbottom commu
 spent some two years as an apprentice to a physinity it was signed by 183 individuals including cian he then
 had taken two years of classes at herbert byers m d later john d higin he school of medicine in

 probably in lethbridge from fall 1883 dr b r yant byer s came from winnipeg and shortly after the august
 typhoid epidemic to stayed at the riverbottoni boarding house he took about november 1885 with his medical training care of
 the sick but he was not connected with he likely was a very useful person for the time the north
 western coal and navigation company and place particularly with help from mr s limited 3 hannah hill a practical nurse
 5 byers would it is not known why eyers came to coal have understood sanitation and the importance of banks
 lethbridge he had emigrated to canada isolation in the treatment of contagious diseases in 1882 and was living in winnipeg
 when a local he would have been able to set broken bones a ized typhoid epidemic broke out in the
 coalbanks common type of injury among miners and teamsters riverbottom community in august 1883 spread he seemed to be familiar
 with the simpler mcdiby water from a communal well it resulted in two cines of the day and his later
 life suggests he deaths those of henry stafford and britton was a caring person with the well being of his
 stephens coalbanks as not unknown to the people patients ever uppermost in his mind one suspects of winnipeg there were
 several reports in the that local authorities were aware of his unofficial newspapers of sir alexander t galt and his
 new mining company the north western coal dr alex johnston is one of southern alberta s leading hisiorians a past
 president of the historical navigation company limited particularly in society of alberta he is a retired range specialist who august

 hat it employed 100 men activities of the sir alexander gall museum in and expected to produce 500 tons of
 coal per day lcthbndge status but recognized his usefulness the literate element tended to ignore him a primary reason why
 he is not mentioned in most historical accounts of the period byers was born at greasboro rotherham south yorkshire near
 sheffield england on september 17 1860 a son of william and anne byers 6 he received his schooling at lynn
 grammar school norfolk and manchester gr ammar school lancashire he then began his long association with medicine at leeds medical
 school leeds west yorkshir e here from 1878 to 1880 he was apprenticed to a general medical practitioner and attended
 the hospital service in leeds infirmary 7 in may 1880 he registered in the medical school and took formal classes
 in 1880 and 188 l in 1882 he came to manitoba and according to his obituary for some years was
 active in the survey of western canada this was he period when he practiced medicine in coalbanks he probably left
 lethbridge about november 1885 in december the north western coal navigation company limited hired dr frank hamilton mewbum of the
 winnipeg general hospital as company and resident physician mewburn started his practice in lethbridge in january 1886 the college of
 physicians and surgeons of the north west territories began to register members in 1886 possibly another factor in byers leaving
 the region as his lack of an m d degree would soon have been revealed in 1888 he was listed
 in the manitoba municipalities section of henderson s north west director y as byers herbert percy m d selkirk but
 was not listed in the selkirk entries for that year in 1889 he was shown as a medical student living
 in winnipeg he graduated on june 6 1890 from the university of manitoba medical college 3 it was obvious that
 he had been given credit for classes taken in 1880 81 at leeds medical school and was able to obtain
 his canadian medical degree with only three or four semester s of formal study at the university of manitoba he
 r egister ed with the college of physicians and surgeons of manitoba on december 3 1890 he then went to
 the new settlement of melita at that time a small collection of tents on the hill west of the present
 townsite this town herbert percy byers became a medical doctor in manitoba after his early experiences in the lethbridge area
 except for six years in selkirk from 1896 to 1901 was the scene of his life s work he was
 enr olled as a charter member of the manitoba medical association at its founding convention on october 8 1908 and
 was for many years a member of the brandon district society of the mma 5 after his return to melita
 from selkirk dr byers took little part in the affairs of the rest of the province in 1913 he opened
 a private hospital in his r esidence to car e for contagious medical diseases and maternity cases this was another
 measure of his devotion to the task of bringing the ver y best care to the ease comfort and health
 of his patients and helped to keep him abr east of modern advances in medicine he left surgical tr eatment
 to those of his colleagues who wer e more recently trained and more accustomed to the art but generations of
 his patients blessed him for his skill in diagnosis his wise choice of treatment and his ever gentle and diligent

 the fullest extent of the law any settlers who are caught dogging running or otherwise worrying cattle there was a
 good deal of talk about the cow business generally nearly everyone present gave his experience of the winter and while
 all agreed that it was a pretty stiff one yet they spoke in good spirit and expressed the belief that
 the losses of range cattle would be comparatively light from the figures given it was estimated that the loss would
 be under 8 per cent calf losses however will be rather heavy calf branding will commence on the north side
