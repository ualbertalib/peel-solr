 east to buffalo lake near alix then south across the red deer river and across the bow iliver some distance
 east of calgary from there he continued south to the oldman river in the fort macleod region at this point
 he turned back retracing his path for a distance until he branched of f and crossed the bow at the
 mouth of the highwood river from there he passed north of calgary until he found his old route to rocky
 mountain house although the proportions of the map are sometimes incorrect it is amazingly accurate in most important details for
 that reason father de smet s route is probably also correct monroe who was thought to be some ally in

 the years that followed he devoted his life to the church and to the indians first at norway house and
 later in alberta he brought friendship and christianity to the cree stony and other tribes in the area at the
 time of his tragic death on about jan 24 th 1875 he was seeing the mission at morley taking shape
 under the direction of his son rev john mcdougall then looking for new fields for missionary labors he was making
 active plans for a mission to serve the blackfoot tribes the letters reproduced here give some indication of rev george

 number of sources including a booklet of tribute published in montreal in 1875 reports in the press and papers in

 for when the storm had passed there was more than twenty years has been the not less than a foot
 of snow which patriarch of his tribe in a two week resting on the big crop of bunch grass journey
 i had a good opportunity of made travelling extremely laborious for observing him at our first encampment both men and
 horses when we startled he said to my son i want you to sing a band of buffalo or a
 flock of antelope for many years i sing myself happy the animals were soon lost sight of in with god
 before going to sleep i can the cloud of snow they raised in fleenot see how anyone can enjoy religion
