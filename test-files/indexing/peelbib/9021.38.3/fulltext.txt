 enlisted as a regular soldier in the united alberta as a young man he was a leading states army he
 was assigned to the 13 th regiwhiskey trader in charge of one of the infamous ment and was sent to
 fort benton in montana ter american trading posts in alberta fort whoop up this fort was a major reason the
 north west mounted police force was sent by the canadian government to establish law and order in 1874 thirteen years
 later davis was elected as the first member of parliament for the alberta district of the north west territories he
 served ten years v in that capacity from 1887 to 1896 then accepted a post in the yukon as collector
 of customs and v went on to establish a mining operation during the v gold strike era ‘ davis appears
 to have been a particularly ambitious man and may personify many who journeyed to the frontier in search of monetary
 gain one may ask whether the fr ontier molded davis or did men of a particular personality type feel drawn
 to the frontier and inevitably leave their mark upon it what sort of individual actively engages in a violent and
 illegal enterprise that promises to destroy the native population and the fur trade itself not only did d w davis
 appear to have little sympathy for native people but throughout his career he seems to have had little sympathy for
 any interests other than his own and showed little respect for the people of alberta in the way he was
 elected to represent them at the highest ronald watson davis government levels v v ritory enlistment papers show his occupation

 author who has a masters degree from the doubt affected his later views with respect to life university of calgary
 san acting hentage planner for the city 01 calgar y and death in 1866 he attended poughkeepsie war not only
 did the soldier have to cope with a letter addressed to his mother in 1870 near this problem but he
 also had to deal with the atti the end of his enlistment states that he intended tude of the local
 citizenry that he had been sent to stop here in montana for one year at least to protect and serve
 as a montanan wrote to the if not more that is if i do well the first year from new
 york herald there is nothing so little his reading of various newspapers he concluded thought of in this part of
 the country as a soldier i think it is very dull all through the states looked on upon with scorn
 and contempt 2 and that is one reason i stop here in montana in a letter dated january 17 1869
 davis ex davis was twenty one years old and already he plained ihat he had moved to a place sixty
 five had a well defined formula for living he wanted miles from fort benton this would have been fort financial
 success and did not intend to be bored shaw the post was known as the queen of while achieving it
 montana forts for the amenities it had such as after his discharge on april 28 1870 davis lawns and shade
 trees it was established in 1867 began to work as a trader for the firm of hamilton as the key
 base for the high border countr y well and healy in a letter dated june 1873 he mdisituated where peigans

 sher pany that i have been for the last three years 7 man considered fort shaw the most important post
 and that he was working at fort hamilton which in montana as the indian tribes could be closely was better
 known as fort whoop up his wages monitored from its strategic position 3 davis also wer e a princely 150
 a month plus board which indicated that he had moved up to a better posi is what a man has
 to work like a slave for on a tion and his wages amounted to 26 85 per month farm for
 six months 8 lewis saum points out no doubt his education in bookkeeping helped win that davis was the epitome
 of the forty niner him his position who seemingly put the stamp of approval on the i am now msk

 private soldier can get i have wit h latent hostility charge now of military stores at this post and davis

 trader one of the many who had penetrated will bet and as big a stock of goods only perhaps blackfoot
 country legally the hudson bay of a different kind i have one set of books to company was responsible for
 the territory keep 4 however it had no way of enforcing authority thus important aspects of davis s character are
 mdi the southern region was without effective law a cated in parts of this letter as he describes how few
 years earlier the american fur company he intends to have 1 000 saved when he leaves which had challenged the
 monopoly of the the army at this time he was cashing cheques h b co had met reverses and sold
 out in 1864 for a discount and making money playing the old system collapsed and the era of the free
 poker he said that he already had 500 saved trader evolved buffalo robe hunters entered the this is quite impressive
 when one calculates that region and buffalo hides for use in making power he had nearly doubled his income in
 two years machinery belts created an endless demand of wheeling and dealing healy and his partner alfred j hamilton a
 davis suggested to his father that he did not nephew of i g baker led the invasion north as want
 to return to the east nor did he r eally want they moved their trade across the boundary in to
 stay in the territor y i think that it is a poor 1869 manyothersfollowedtoshareinthebonanza place for a man in my
 opinion but still i have had paul sharp provides an american perspective good offers to go to work when my
 time is out when he suggests that the free traders brief and by responsible men 5 however none of sojourn
 in whoop up country was based on the the usual ventures appealed to him he was more approach the english
 had initiated in 1607 that interested in the profits to be made by working of grabbing the robes while they
 lasted meanfor the businessmen who were involved in the fur while debauching the indians with whiskey to trade in what
 davis refers to as british posses secure their properties quickly and cheaply sions but by the 1870 s this practise
 was completel y davis was in charge of fort whoop up during the early 1870 s when whiskey and violence
 created so much havoc among the plains indians in the above view a band of blood indians is seen in
 front of the heavily fortified post contrary to the methods used by the established hugh dempsey describes trading companies at
 that time the liquor was transported to the post in its con the region north of fort benton became one
 centrated manner ten gallons were dumped into of the most lawless areas on the frontier a rendez a 40 gallon
 barrel and the resi filled up with vous for tough and restless men from every part water burnt sugar or
 oil of bourbon was then of north america and europe these men added for flavoring fought each other resisted the
 monopoly of the when trading for liquor the indian passed his honorable company and tricked the indians as they own
 half gallon keg and a buffalo robe through freely violated the laws of both countries in their the trap door
 to the trader the keg was filled greed for profits and the indian warned not to drink it near the
 davis was a man of striking and commanding post but to return to his own camp appearance a lover of
 all sports especially horse if an average trading party about nine gallons racing billiards and poker he was an extra
 good of liquor would be sold the remainder of the mixer with people and having a commanding per robes would
 be traded for ammunition cotton sonality was well liked his word was his bond print vermilion and other trade objects
 ‘ he was never known to fail a friend he was although the free traders were involved in an known
 as d w to all of his friends he was called illegal enterprise condemned by most americans spit ayna or
 tall man by the blackfoot he was as brutal and disreputable they did not view themintelligent and even tempered and
 built up a sue selves in the same light some traders imagined cessful trade with the indians in the words
 of his themselves as benefactors bringing the indians the old benefactor john healy he was my best good things of
 life many whites living in the man 12 west also believed that whiskey would help elimi it was reported that
 the trade at whoop up nate the indian problem making it easier for during the winter of 1872 was good
 and the store civilization to advance cecil denny stated that room was overflowing with two thousand buffalo the north west
 mounted police found these free robes worth 12 000 however the winter had traders to be a ver y decent
 lot of men in spite not been devoid of trouble a traveller at this time of all that we had
 heard against them many recorded that there were at least seventy dead of them d w davis being typical were
 recently among the bloods that winter due to the direct out of army uniforni and were relatively decent cause of
 liquor obtained at one of the posts as by frontier standards attempting to avoid violence unless extreme circumstances prevailed commented
 the indian and the trader had a symbiotic rela if we had only been allowed to carry on the bustionship
 the trader did not wish to infuriate the mess in our own way for another two year s v v
 v indian in that he was outnumbered in strength and there would have been no trouble now as to feedneeded
 to obtain the robes and pelts to turn a ing the indians for there would have been none profit if
 the indians wanted whiskey and rifles left to feed whiskey pistols strychnine and that is what was supplied the indian
 did not wish other like processes would have effectively to destroy the source that provided the firewater cleared away these
 wretched natives 8 thus the whiskey traders were allowed to continue on october 9 1874 after a long and arduous
 with their destructive activities during the years march across country from manitoba the norththat the large companies had traded whiskey
 they west mounted police arrived at fort whoop up realized that in order to obtain continued supplies but d w
 davis who was in charge of the post of fur the indians should not be destroyed free was absent although
 the police had been expecttraders did not have this view in a short time ing a confrontation an employee and
 a few indian the blackfoot were stripped of robes pelts horses women greeted the men and invited them to stay

 the whiskey trade for the most part was at free traders financed their businesses through an end merchants such as

 davis reported that indian treaty money totalling davis had by this time taken an indian wife he sixty thousand dollars
 was spent inside of four was willing to help healy rule with an iron days with the 1 g baker
 company collecting hand ‘ about one half of it a very good retail disease and social disorganization as well as

 time before could get such a share 22 by this time however there may have been he wrote from fort
 calgary march 13 1878 other reasons than those of economics for davis to his mother who apparently wondered if he

 with a blood indian well no i never intended to nor don t yet i woman named revenge walker by

 to v v written accounts employees of the dominion government officers of the mounted police and v the hudson s

 and each carcass contained bladders full chosen to represent them in ottawa davis was of whiskey contraband at that for

 settlea thousand dollars as to who would win and my ment conflict was inevitable empires are not lost father always
 considered he won the election by without battles and davis was an important figure driving up to lac la biche
 with a noted horse during the last days of the era when the cattleman man of the early days frank
 strong they took was king along john costigan a well known lawyer of in 1895 davis decided to end his
 political the early days and they cut out a lot of non career after two successful terms in office there
 existent half breed voters he always considered may have been many reasons for his retirement that won him the election
 34 but two of these may be identified election cam davis s constituents the cattlemen were rela paigns are expensive

 beef prices had im bay company in 1891 and this no doubt removed proved consistently throughout the period from an
 important source of funds of more relevance 1884 on and the political influence of the ranchers was the decline of
 the large cattle ranches the was remarkable they had sympathetic representa golden age of ranching was over by 1895 when
 tives on town councils and beyond this they had many of the large companies had gone out of access to
 superior levels within po litical structures business with d w davis in the house of commons and davis retired from

 the control of two indivi all right for producers and i look for better things duals after davis interceded later
 when the to be found there than any other portion of the ranching community felt it did not have a

 stayed with him at fort cudahay the a new company was formed which was headed first north west mounted police

 then bought the calgary herald to transportation and trading company of chicago create the calgary herald and alberta journal this
 company transported tourists to the yukon by augmenting their metropolitan influence with and operated trading posts at fort cudahay on
 the most influential newspaper in the southwest forty mile river miller creek stewart river cattlemen gained much wider coverage for
 their and pelly river what remains puzzling is davis s counter arguments to the persistent accusations of connection if any
 to healy s operation what did pro settlement press 36 healy mean when he suggested that he would be there
 were many problems over water rights pleased to see that you are taken care of reserves the settlers requested that
 the matter of knowing the background and history of these two water reserves be decided by a majority of resi

 engine he was informed by ottawa that he must give up d w davis died in the yukon on june

 banquets and the davis an important era in the history of alberta would davis was a prominent citizen in dawson
 city yukon his son chester behind the girl with the checked yoke dress was among the children celebrating christmas there
 in 1898 9 not be an exaggeration donald watson davis american civil war veteran and whiskey trader was the last
 of a unique breed of men who chose to live beyond the pale with respect to what was expected of
 those with civilized sensibilities west writ large of the inner man we can know the tragedies and triumphs he experienced
 through his life reflect the saga of the great northvery little davis gave few interviews he left few is therefore
 impossible to know how he viewed personal papers and he did not keep a diary it the society that he
 helped to form and that in its own way helped form him and his children both white and mixed blood
 one cannot view davis as a canadian hero nor as a man who was devoted to the future of his
 piece of the west life on the canadian prairies has been generally depicted as one of hard work hardships and
 sacrifice prosperity was the domain of those sturdy yeomen who had god and weather on their side the remittance man

 is no problem before the people today of greater importance than the building of good roads thanks to the progressive
 railway policy of the rutherford government we are rapidly securing branch lines of railway which will spread out within a
 few years over the whole province but this only increases the need of good wagon roads over which the increased
 grain crops must be hauled road work is now being done throughout the province and it might not be out
 of place to draw attention to a few phases of this important matter in thirty years of road making in
 the west the government officials of both saskatchewan and alberta have tested every method and observed every result their experience
 should have taught them something and that experience should be of value to local improvement councillors and road overseers one
 conclusion the government has reached is that the middle of the road should never be plowed up and in fact
 they go so far as to refuse any grant to a district where the plowing of the road is permitted
 the sod is the natural foundation upon which the road should be built the prairie trail is the best road
 we have liberal use should be made of brush as a foundation in all sloughs and mud holes these are
 not improved by piling mud into mud to make more mud the foundation is the first consideration and nature in
 this district supplies the best possible foundation by every slough in the form of brush the ditches should be kept
 as far apart as road allowance will permit so the grade will not be kept soaked wherever water stand culverts
 should be put in in solving the problem of every slough the question of drainage should be the first one
 considered get rid of the water and the road problem is solved the great majority of the local improvement councillors
 are entirely dissatisfied with the present system of local government we quite agree that radical changes are necessary a new
 municipal act has already been foreshadowed and will probably be the main business of one session of the legislature alberta

 classroom control young inexperienced suffered cruelly i forget who called on me to anxious to appear competent they hesitated to
 ask settle the dispute for help until often the situation was quite out of without the least idea of how
 i would do so control and their effectiveness as teachers quite i arranged a conference at the school involving destroyed
 myself the boy his parents and the teacher she at this point the teacher or a parent in the recounted
 his misdeeds particularly his insolence killam school division would seek the superin and demanded an apology the boy s mother
 was tendent s assistance mine in short in the days extremely vocal about the assault on her son and before
 the school divisions were organized only maintained that it was she who should apologize one thing could have been done
 in such circum the father hitherto silent suggested that in his stances dismiss the teacher who might be so dis
 opinion each owed the other an apology i gave enchanted as never to return to the classroom the teacher a
 look significant i hoped but she fortunately under the divisional system there was oblivious i then suggested that i should
 like was another solution although i always tried to to speak to her alone we two adjourned to the warn
 beginning teacher s there is nothing in the cloak room where i intimidated that i thought the contract that says
 you have to be loved some father was right still fell into the trap especially since trained reluctantly she agreed
 mutual apologies were teachers were scarce those were the days of the tendered and accepted and once more peace correspondence
 cour se supervisors whom the prevailed in that little school teachers scorned as sitters and to save them in the
 killam school division there were two fur the profession i was usually able to arrange rur al schools their districts
 adjacent to each other a transfer or trade of positions with a teacher in but otherwise quite isolated from the
 rest of divianother school but only if all concerned were sion in one of these it had apparently become a
 agreeable tradition that during out of classroom time the thus i would be able to keep a teacher and she
 oldest boy or boys tyrannized the other children usually she could retain her dignity and self the situation came to
 my attention when the respect eventually becoming a competent instruc teacher reported that two brothers had been untor and va
 lued member of her community but some disciplinary cases were solved otherwise one contretemps between a young teacher and dr

 also larger frogs rorized by two grade ix boys suffering such another problem arose when a rural school near indignities
 as having their caps thrown down the alliance shrank in enrollment to two pupils holes in the outdoor privies and
 forced to eat brothers and the board of trustees decided to close ‘ horse apples from the school stable a
 diet sup it and pay the parents to convey the boys to the plenient favoured by sparrows but not usually
 by nearest school however since they came from people a family with a known history of tuberculosis i suggested to
 the teacher that she suspend the although the youngsters had been given a clean two miscreants pending action by the
 divisional bill of health by a medical officer they were most school board she as principa l of the school
 even unwelcome in fact were cruelly har assed by the though it had only one classroom had that power older
 boys resident in the district soon the young but i did not even though i was superintendent teacher phoned me
 to tell me that the parents of of the school division a principal can suspend all the other children were
 going to keep their chila pupil but only the board of trustees can expel dren at home as long as
 these two boys attended him or her what should she do she took my advice and in due course the
 boys suspecting that said parents were probably with their parents appeared before the board listening in on the party line
 i told the teacher when they had heard all the circumstances the to keep the school open even if only
 the two trustees asked me for advice i recommended that brothers attended and if the other children did not they
 not be allowed to return to their own school i would prosecute the parents to the full extent or attend
 the one next to it but be permitted to of the truancy provisions of the school act also register at
 any other in the system this recom i would visit the school forthwith which i did mendation they accepted the
 treatened boycott was averted 13 after arriving at the school and sending the girls well the principal replied with a
 laugh out to play i had the biggest local boy stand back when geordie first got here he sure was
 a to back with the older of the two brothers the problem but i m told that one day a
 couple of former was a head taller i asked him if he had older boys took him down to the
 washroom and ever heard of british justice yes he had did he warned him ‘ geordie if you don t
 str aighten up think it was british justice for him and his friends and fly right we re going to
 beat the shit out of to bully the brothers the way they had been doing you no more trouble with
 geordie of course i got no answer i then proceeded to in some other discipline cases my role as supergive
 the local boys a scolding such as they had intendent was peripheral one involved a grade never had before or
 probably since and promised xi class in sociology in the heisler high school wor se if there was more trouble
 then i dismissed a subject wherein credit and standing were obthe school tamed on the basis of the school s
 recommenda the teacher young but eminently sensible told tion rather than by provincial examination the me that there was no
 str ap in the school and the students in this class taught by the second high pupils knew it consequently
 they had no fear of school teacher were so unruly that the principal a whipping so on my way back
 home i stopped threatened to cancel all the teacher s recommenat a hardware in alliance and purchased two feet dations
 for credit in that subject if the students of two inch belting there is no such thing as conduct did
 not improve when it did not the a legal strap although many people think there principal carried out his threat
 enraged students is i charged my purchase to the school division and their parents appealed to the minister of eduhad
 the store parcel it up and on the way out of cation against such arbitrary action town i mailed it
 to the teacher as the department of education s man on the i am happy to say that as long
 as that school spot so to speak rural superintendents then were r emained in operation the strap was never used
 not local but provincial appointees i was directed the knowledge that it was in the teacher s desk to investigate
 report a nd recommend after interwas enough viewing both the principal and the teacher con on other occasions discipline problems
 got cerned i po inted out that it was the principal s solved without the intervention of the school staff
 and not he teacher s signature that the department let alone the superintendent one such case in required for high
 school standing in grades x and volved geordie illegitimate unwanted appa xi subjects and therefore the action should be rently
 unloved but living with his mother then honoured no credits should be granted without married to a man who was
 not geordie s father it in short i recommended that the principal s it is therefore not surprising that geordie
 sought decision should stand attention in the little one room school he attended this appar ently was not an acceptable
 recomeven if he could obtain it only by anti social and mendation for the department then sent out not disruptive
 behaviour in fact he was a pain in the one but two high school inspectors as a sort of neck
 or lower to a succession of young school court of appeal however they endorsed my marms recommendation and not one
 student in heisler eventually the school was closed nd its pupils high school received credit for sociology that including geordie
 transferred to the school in year alliance on a visit to that centre i asked the prin after the war
 ms kelly was probably well past cipal stan mallett how geordie was doing retirement age we daren t ask and
 sadly crippled geordie who was the bland answer by arthritis about 1948 we closed her little one you know geordie

 school not far yes that geordie away the latter with a mixed catholic and pro he doing fine no trouble
 at all testant enrolment had a reputation for belligerence what did you do to him i demanded between the two
 groups before and after school nothing hours en route from and to their homes come on stan what happened on
 a routine visit to the school i asked her if 14 there was any discipline problem none she act makes
 pupils responsible to the principal of replied then i pressed her about this on going their school which she was
 for their behaviour guerrilla warfar e oh she said i heard about from the time they leave home until they
 return that and put a stop to it so i asked her how she did it how i wondered could
 this old lady who well she answered you know i was could hardly hobble across the school yard to her
 teacher of this school back in 1917 i didn little home control the behaviour of pupils a mile anyway all
 my present pupils parents were my or two down the road and out of sight even pupils then so i
 simply told them that this sort though she had the legal authority the school of thing had to stop and

 title has its origin as almost everyone throughout canada must have known in the energetic promoter and manager sir john
 lister kaye this gentleman has just returned from having completed another tour of the company s eleven properties running from
 balgonie to langdon sir john is judging from his happy expression just as pleased as punch and with good reason
 for he brings with him the most glowing accounts of the work in every branch of farming on the 110
 000 acres there can be no doubt that the shareholders in the old country will be most thoroughly satisfied with
 the result of the first year s working and management of this huge concern when the company first started operations
 there were many ver y many who were inclined to scoff at the idea of farming on such an extensive
 scale being successfully carried out these must admit now that they were wrong as there is every indication of the
 company being a financial success sir john has received permission from his directors to enter upon the butchering business the
 centre of operations to be at calgary the plans for the slaughter houses and shops have been drawn up by
 messrs child wilson and have been sent to the directors for their approval the attempt to domesticate range cattle for
 dairy purposes has been most successful and at balgonie stair dunmore kincarth crane lake gull lake and bantr y at
 which farms there are about 500 cows cows are a lready being milked sir john deserves great credit for this
 movement and ther e is no reason why other r ancher s should not also utilize the milk from their
 cows instead of letting it go to waste sir john has lately submitted a report to his directors regarding a
 creamery and cheese factory and they are so satisfied with the report that arrangements will be made by sir john
 and mr richardson the vice president of the company who will arrive at new york to day to begin the
 work at once the creamery will be at swift current and the operations will be commenced next october the cream
 from the 10 farms will be shipped per express every 24 hours to swift current sir john on his own
 account has offered a silver cup to whichever manager has the greatest number of cows milking by october the plans
 for the creamery which is to be constructed of concrete are being drawn up by the company s architect a
 sample of butter made from the milk of the range cows has just been received by sir john which he

 to settle somewhere in western canada lossing ‘ ‘ his wife who attained her 50 th birthday on the trail
 and their 14 year old son travelled with the group on a canadian pacific railway colonist car to edmonton where
 the party stopped to take stock of its options hearing good reports about the sparsely settled region of the beaver

 magazine published at london ontario canadian hinterland while still a young boy he after five successful years on the editonal
 staff concluded that if canada was to amount to any of that paper albright began to encounter hostility thing as
 a nation it would have to consist of more from a section of his readership in the election than a
 thin ribbon of settlement along the 49 th parallel this idea stayed with him all his life and mr vick

 former protestations of innocence and the impossibility of finding a jur y to convict them the first move in the

 the vigilantes for the purpose of discussing the merits or demerits of a petition which was drawn up in their
 behalf to be presented to his excellency the governor general asking his protection from the law of the land to
 which they are subject under the charge of malicious destruction of property setting forth that they are law abiding citizens
 who think they act on the side of right and justice in the absence of governmental authorities well perhaps they
 did think all that and were ignorant of the law in such matters they ought to have been sure on
 the subject ignorance of the law is no excuse considering all things it was not a ver y easy matter
 for the vigilance committee to even think that they were on the side of right and justice for their mouthpiece
 the bulletin said plainly in its first issue after the formation of the society what the intention of the government
 is cannot be told but the intentions of the people the vigilantes are known and whether legal or illegal right
 or wrong just or unjust they will carry out these intentions to the extent of their ability and all that
 will hinder them will be the opposition of a stronger force then themselves their desire to act on the side

 three articles consisting of the letters and reminiscences of w e trail at lac la biche these deal with the
 period from the winter of 1875 76 to the autumn of 1878 the first part appeared in the spring 1990
 issue of alberta history and dealt with the period 1874 75 winter 1875 76 the winter has so far as
 of december 30 th been a pleasant one altho we have had some severe cold as high as 66 degrees
 below zero we had a ver y heavy gale of wind one night about the beginning of the month which
 i thought would have carried off the roofs of the houses it v damaged the roof of the stores some
 of the settlers houses it was by far the heaviest gale of v v v wind i ever expenenced in
 winter however we have had ver y little wind besides very little snow i do not think we have more
 than 4 inches of snow we are well off for all the necessities of life as the trades flourishes we
 have very 4 little to complain of i have much busier times v than i have had since i left
 fort ellice i am obliged to take my dogs run after foes we are ver y hotly opposed by traders
 but they will have v to go to the wall just before christmas we received some canned fruits sweets for
 the children from v walter our children got far more of such things than i used to get when i
 was a child perhaps ‘ iiiiaiii ed ard traill they get more in a year than i ate in all
 my childhood their aunt kate grandparents send them sweeties mama only gives walter i two or some ever y opportunity
 not a few but sometimes three she papa eat all the rest i will tell 3 or 4 pounds at
 a time walter also contributes her all about it a liberal share sometimes i think they get more new years
 is the busiest time in the year for than is good for them one day harriet heard me but this
 year more so than usual harriet too katie saying to herself in cree i will tell grand had too much
 to do master willie is very troublepapa i will tell grandpapa that when he sends some she has to prepare
 a feast for everyone 23 within several miles compass so you may judge toronto winnipeg but ther e the three
 days that that without a servant she has her hands full i i spent passed quickly and pleasa ntly enough
 my am thankful to say with the exception of harriet brother walter had been at garry and expected suffering for
 sometime past from a succession of to see me on my return so he did but only boils we are
 all in good health long enough to r ecognise each other he being on i have made up my mind
 to ask once more for one steamer i on another we passed without leave to go home next summer they
 should slacking speed so we had not even time to injustice let me go next summer mr lawrence speak 3
 i he had been at garry and was on his clarke promised when i consented to come to this way
 up with hamilton the cc some place that if i was successful in trade that he would others use his
 influence to procure me leave this coming i certainly shall not be able to affoal a lake holisummer i have
 been so far successful that the day for sometime to be sure of 1700 i have r eturns of this
 outfit far exceed the r eturns of any spent this summer i bought 480 acres of land year for sometime
 past so that i have good grounds in the states which in the course of a few years for claiming
 the promised reward if i get leave should pay some high interest 33 in addition my i will probably take
 the family with me but that trip from fort gany to ll biche cost me as much will depend upon
 circumstances we heard lately as my expense from ft garry to canada from mr mckay who is well the old
 couple are back 34 altho the governor had promised me quite alone as all their children are at school in
 that i should be at no expense in returning home red river i intend if all is well taking harriet
 from garry i had to buy a horse conveyance and the childr en out to pitt with me in spring
 and which cost me above 200 which i could ill spare if we go no further i will return leaving
 them there as my expenses have been very high for some time should i get leave to go home it
 i left winnipeg on the 8 th september in comis probable i may leave one or more of the chil
 pany with r hardisty invalide a clerk two then with the grandpar ents my mea ns are limited young ladies
 one the niece of a brother officer it would be a great expense and not a little going to join
 her uncle the other a canadian girl trouble to take them all with me altho mr mckay going to many
 a doctor at edmonton who she has kindly offered in case of my going to defray never saw we had
 seventeen horses 5 four part of my expenses of course i should not like wheeled vehicles a cart i was
 proprietor of to take anything from him but i know his kind a buckboard and a mare i had also
 two horses heart if i refuse to accept it he will give it to so called supplied by the company
 the ladies harriet were green hardisty being rheumatic was helpless and our only man was lazy so i had to
 stir summer fall 1876 my lumps especially as our horses were very i took my leave and went to canada
 harriet wild at least those that had life enough to be so a nd walter visited carlton house while willie
 and some on the other hand were so tame that they kate remained with their grandmother at fort pitt could
 hardly be induced to move the roads were i enjoyed myself excessively wherever i went bad and it took long
 to hitch up and get underamongst old friends and acquaintances i found way things were dull enough were it not
 for the the parting from my family a most trying one ladies who used to vary the monotony of the
 thing altho you might not think so from my manner by driving into each other now and again at the
 i was obliged to appear unconcerned and i may expense of the waggon wheels which gener ally have appeared heartless
 but it was only by a great were two or three spokes the worse for each eneffort that i controlled
 myself if as i trust a rail counter you may be sure that in the long run they road is
 built into the peace river within a few did not improve in appearance i mean the wagyears i may yet
 see my dear mother once more gons nor yet the ladies for that matter for the wind in the flesh
 but if is not the will of god i have and weather did not improve their appearances a sure certain
 hope of a happier meeting where much there will be no more partings 3 on my return as the spokes
 began to be a premium with us trip it was dull enough on the cars between and the game of
 breaking them got somewhat 24 this group picture shows the traill family about 1896 harriet and william are seated while
 behind them are their oldest children walter jessie willie and ethel at centre are maria mary and harriet while in
 front are anne and catherine monotonous our ladies varied their amusement had sent some bread by brereton so we ate
 some by breaking an axle now and again considering bread and then made a shelter for miss c and left
 that they generally came out head fore most at her to pass the night no doubt in fear and tremeach
 encounter i was surprised they did not try bling next morning some of the horses were some other way of
 amusing themselves we broke astray so we were absent from camp quite a while axles not less than five times
 when we reached looking for them when we returned we found fort ellice we had two mended but before we
 got miss c crying she thought we had deserted her forty miles they broke another i wanted to put we
 over took the rest of the party at noon after in a wooden axle but hardisty insisted in waiting which
 we had no adventure more than a few while we sent brereton back to ellice to get the break down
 of axles c i was head carpenter and axle mended wheelright i made wooden axles with no tools we waited
 till next afternoon when hardisty but an axe butcher knife i got to carlton miss bunn the man left me
 miss coulson and found h at carlton with walter willie to wait for brereton follow on sundown came kate being
 with her grandmother at pitt no brereton we had nothing to eat no tent however i had an oil cloth
 with which i set to work winter spring 1877 and made a shelter for miss c when just as i
 had finished it was getting dark brereton turned i was back at lac la biche in time for christup we
 went to work and got the axle on and mas in may of 1877 i brought down harriet and started
 off but did not go a mile when the axle the children to fort pitt for a change and to
 see heated stuck fast we could do nothing but the old folks only mrs mckay however is at camp so
 camp we did without wood it being a home harriet is disappointed at not meeting her plain but as luck
 would have it mrs mcdonald father the children are all well they are all with 2 us we intend leaving
 master willie with his to victoria to the treaty of course they will all grandmother who wishes to have him
 walter return i should not grieve if they never did 3 m i was going to school at the r
 c mission he was am always busy either gardening or carpentering only been in attendance five weeks but promises when
 not engaged with my regular business to get on well we will have a quiet house with the strawberries are
 beginning to ripen and i think only little kate through the week walter on there will be a great show
 of them as well as sundays willie is beginning to say a few words berries of almost every description there
 is cer i never in my life saw a child with such a mania tainly no fear of them ripening
 before full grown for horses he seems to think of nothing else and as we have seldom seen the sun
 since i returned drives them even in his sleep he is a very hearty from pitt it is the coolest
 season i have ever witboy for his age and tho willful has a good ‘ nessed till my return there
 was no rain since disposition then it has rained every day i leave for llb tomorrow 28 th of may
 we the children have a new play fellow what do had a pleasant trip down arriving here fort pitt you
 suppose it is a tame skunk of which they on our tenth day 17 th we lived on ducks are
 as proud as if they had a new baby brother geese most of the way as we were hard up
 for or sister but really it is a dear little fellow very all kinds of provisions except potatoes at our
 post playful it is cleaner than a cat and follows them ere i left the flies commence to be very
 trouble all over even outside they set up a doleful howl some they will plague us more or less going
 yesterday when they thought they had lost him home we hope to feast on eggs going home as when they
 were picking berries the flies espethis is the laying season there are plenty of lakes cially the bull dogs are
 ver y troublesome the on the road the ducks at this season are ver y cattle horses never leave the
 smoke during the poor days 4 how long i will stay at lac la biche i do not fall 1877
 know i have made application for a change to some place where i can be near medical aid my we
 are very happy just now in having our throat has not troubled me so much since i got darling willie
 with us once more mrs mckay my medicines but still i fear i shall not be able came we had
 looked for her earlier but heard to effect a perfect cure i shall try mother s lime that she was
 ver y ill with lumbago we also heard water cure when i have convinced myself that my that our boy
 was ill so when they did not turn up present treatment will not result in a perfect cure at the
 appointed time we were ver y anxious but it is poor policy to try remedy after remedy not all our
 fears were needless as they both appeared fully testing one before trying another the hb in good health willie has
 grown a great deal he affairs owing to the extremely low prices in the has grown a full head since
 we left him in may european markets for fur are in a very unsatis last he talks pretty plain and
 is very amusing factory state nor are things in this country much he mixes cree english together in a very
 funny better through mismanagement unless they keep manner he is very fond of his grandmother and faith with me i
 shall very likely leave the service is very much spoiled by her i fear he calls me next spring however
 i shall i hope know more grandpapa his mother hallet walter is wat of my own mind on this subject
 next month or eter he says panks thanks for everything at longest after the council i am in hopes that
 he calls cows oxen calves lonreau french for i shall be appointed to the charge of battleford bull and is
 very much afraid of them but of or more properly speaking the hbc post at that horses he has no
 dread he will ride any horse place 36 he is put upon hold on like mexican he will get a
 rope and put a noose on it and throw it over summer 1877 the heads of his brother or sister
 me chapsa we are jogging along in our usual hum drum netainesis i have caught my horses we had existence
 the weather is very warm of late 37 roast ducks for dinner as soon as he sat down there will
 be quite an exodus from this place he said she sheep duck me like a bone on during the summer
 the people will all be going one occasion i was working with some mcdi 26 of 110 skins and had
 not done i called the father in who merely said how did the little scamp get in he did not
 so much as say a word to the boy which with other circumstances would lead to the belief that he
 was not unaware of what his son had been about i sent a dispatch to the officer in command at
 fort saskn requesting his immediate presence to sift the matter to the bottom r a few days after a corporal
 interpreter were sent for to apprehend the young scamp he was on an island with his father fishing the weather
 was rough and no large craft so we had to wait several days when the wind went down they secured
 their game and took him off to victoria but before going subpeonaed myself and two others to appear at fort
 saskatchewan to testify what we knew about the affair altho i was daily expecting h arriet to be confined with
 henry i was obliged to leave her with her mother and shut up my shop and off we came the
 trial took place the day we arrived he was found guilty and a true bill being found against him he
 was remanded till the arrival of a stipendary lawrence clarke who was stationed at fort carlton was magistrate who is
 competent to try criminal traill s superior officer in the hudson s bay company cases 43 i trust the young
 rascal will get a few years in the reformatory which is all that will save cines he got a bottle
 to play with and wanted him from the gallows the whole family are a to open it so when no
 one was noticing him he nuisance to the neighbourhood we had to took the hammer and broke the bottle and
 spilled enter into recognisance to appear when the judge the contents he calmly said me sikena i have comes but
 as it may be some time i have come emptied it with hammer a turnip he calls either here edmonton
 to wait for the trial this is very lump or the cree 00 te se i could fill pages provoking
 but i have to submit i have hired a of his funny little ways sayings he is very gentleman to
 go down and take charge during my willful but very loving and after a fit of bad temper absence which
 will be ver y pleasant for harriet generally proclaims me good boy and comes who knows barter a good name
 for a trader to be kissed 4 when we left carlton to go to ll biche in ‘ 74 we
 travelled with him mrs mckay s may is her e winter 1877 78 too as witness so i fear the
 old lady will be unable on the night of the 11 th instant of october to return before i go
 back which will be very in 1877 a son of william ried reid formerly of convenient for her as she
 came up with wheeled fort pitt entered the shop the thief a lad of vehicles about 13 years had entered
 by one of the gable i canot make up my mind as to whether to leave windows on which i
 had nailed cotton instead of the service or try something on my own a c at parchment or glass as
 it is several feet from the present a commission is worse than my wages but ground i deemed it impossible
 almost for anyone we must have a change soon and we hope it may much less a child to effect
 an entrance and am be for the better i should not wonder if the whole of opinion that he did
 not enter unassisted he was thing changed hands soon in a year or two more detected by lighting matches to
 choose the articles we must send our children away to school if h he wanted he had already taken to
 the amount would only consent to let them go so far it would 27 be so nice to send them
 to mother and katie to the r c m school and gets on well i don t could attend her
 aunt s school walter a boys think much of their system of teaching but for all school but i fear
 she would not like them to be that he makes fair progress in reading spelling where she could not see
 them at least once in the c he also reads french but is very shy about year showing off his
 accomplishments the nuns assure us that he understands all that is said to him spring 1878 in that tongue 47
 i trust in god that my katie the season is the earliest i can remember here may be able to
 learn the pia no tho i don t believe or in canada april 28 th the ice is almost all
 she has the slightest ear for music harriet learned out of the lake the trees coming out in leaf a
 little music at school but has forgotten all about we are now living on fresh fish which is a change
 it after hung fish which we have been confined to my throat keeps about the same way i don t
 all winter i am fisherman in fact just now i have ‘ think it gets any worse i am still
 applying the not a soul to do hand s turn as my only help left remedies i got in philadelphia
 they keep it from me the other day i will however have another getting worse at any rate 49 i
 have not suffered tomorrow nearly so much lately but at he same time am very the baby little henry growing
 fast as dear anxious to be cured 5 a little pet as ever i saw tho i say it myself
 he i left home on the 9 th of may i stayed 3 days ver y seldom cries indeed he
 is almost always at victoria attending to my packing c then crowing laughing he is smart for his age and
 drove up here edmonton in one day 75 miles strong he catches hold of everything and tho he since then
 i have been busy as a sailor i was cannot sit quite well if placed on his back turns off
 for home the day on the 23 rd may 5 i had at once the little fellow lies on the
 bed in only been home six days when i got orders to a beaded moss bag sucking his thumb laughing
 come out here victoria and relieve the officer at me willie says papa look at your boy in charge who
 has gone to fort saskatchewan he is laughing at you master walter still goes upon business this is my second
 trip out here ‘ i s j i v v vi l ‘ v i life was harsh for traders
 and trappers in the lac la biche area above is an illustration by frederic remington of travellers on the trail
 near the fort in the 1890 s 28 this spring the first time i was absent from home to attend
 her school even were mother kate 21 days the steamer northcote is expected to take the responsibility worry of two
 young and some one must be here to receive the cargo indians i could not send them before a year
 from and see to the reloading of her c so here i am this time then their mother would have
 to take i don t know for how long the water is high and them has been for some days
 so that the steamer should be close at hand but there is no knowing fall 1878 the want of rain
 in the spring is the great draw i have just about october 6 th returned from back to this country
 june is the rainy month of edmonton where i stayed about ten days i had the year and sometimes july
 august but it by no means a pleasant trip it snowed the night seldom rains in may there is promise
 of an abun before i left home i got drenched before i got dance of all kinds of wild fruit
 if we have no frost 6 miles the trees were loaded down with snow to cut the blossoms this victoria
 is a dolefully so that we could hardly force a passage through dull place nothing whatever to amuse one and
 after the snow melted we had rain almost every nothing to do at home i always amuse myself day i
 was on the road sometimes snow the road by working the garden workshop and at odd was as you may
 imagine anything but in a fine times by fishing here it otherwise so i have to state my saddle horse
 once broke thr ough a read old papers look out at the river in hopes bridge and could not get
 out i hitched another of seeing the steamer 52 horse to his neck by the tail and hauled him out
 we at least the priests myself are very much i hope my travelling is over for the season i don
 t interested in the war news it is very tan suppose i shall have any great amount of winter talising
 to have to wait indefinitely for news if travelling the state of affairs in europe don t come to some
 we still live the same old monotonous life few settlement soon there will be no market whatever things happening worthy
 of record however so for furs so there is no very pleasant prospect in long as we are in the
 enjoyment of good health store for junior officers i am sometimes at a loss we need not worry about the
 quiet life we lead what to do as regards my future means of liveli this country is changing very much
 every time hood no doubt the service presents a livelihood i go out to the frontier i find it getting
 more and so long as the concern holds out but if the price more civilized that is to say i
 see a great deal of furs does not rise i don t suppose the share more of the white man
 and his evil ways hear holders will continue to invest their money in such more blasphemy and wickedness in a
 day than i a hopeless speculation it is now over two years used to hear in the course of a
 year you know since the commissioned officer s r eceived a single that it is a lways the roughest class
 that first find cent for their services and still the price of furs their way to a new country falls
 v harriet left me for a month on a visit to her i cannot however make up my mind to
 launch parents at fort pitt she had a pleasant trip and out for myself i suppose i will be called
 upon just got back before the bad weather set in she to decide when i go to edmonton if i
 decide upon heani that her brother henry met with a serious remaining in the service i must send my children
 accident he was going out duck shooting at the to school it will cost not a little if i send
 them fort gate he met an indian and stopped to speak to winnipeg i have been thinking that perhaps to
 him he set his gun on the ground holding his it would be cheaper for me to send them to
 canada hand on the muzzle a child came along and for two or three years to send katie to the
 ladies pulled the trigger the charge passing through the school at st johns would not cost much less than palm
 of his hand and carrying off the brim of his half my wages of course it is only an idea
 hat an one of the bones of his hand striking him unless either kate or mary could take charge of
 on the eyebrow he will probably lose the use of them w k it would not be practicable it his
 hand m would be an under stood thing that i should pay we had a most peculiar fall and most
