 the boom of 19 11 12 descended upon edmonton as if overnight there were signs of increased real estate interest
 about mid summer of 1911 and by mid november advertising filled columns of the three daily papers real estate offices
 filled all available buildings and blackboards outside of the offices were filled with chalk written specials today the boom was
 bringing a tremendous business in its train staid and wisdom laden men and women were buying lots on the usual
 terms for those days a third down six and twelve i caught the fever along with the some years to
 come so on monday rest but had no money i was married morning march 5 1912 i was at the
 during the summer and my wages were back of the counter of the old building 75 per month i was
 livestock clerk facing south on wh yte avenue about for the department of agriculture thanks five doors east of the
 c p r tracks and to the kindness of and my father s pull was soon initiated into the business
 of with the honorable duncan marshall buying and selling minister of agriculture when my brother in law came from olds
 to visit as i look back through the years i us i explained to him the opportunities recall a few
 anecdotes that are woven of making money in real estate and into the fabric of this ungodly boom asked h
 im to back my note for 250 which was destined to do far more harm this he did without a
 moment s hesita than good tion and for his kindness i remember rewarding him with a pair of shoes one
 interesting experience related to an option which quigley held on a my first venture was a lot in windsor quarter
 section of land in the vicinity park bought for 650 a third down six of 83 rd street and some
 two or three and twelve i sold it a week later for miles south of whyte avenue this 750 and
 was in business the winter option called for a purchase price of was mild which helped stimulate busi 21 000
 a third down and i do not ness at the beginning of march 1912 know what was to be done
 about the i was in the office of a d quigley and balance on the appointed day mr he asked
 me wh at my wages were quigley took 7 000 in folding money when i told him 80 per month
 includ out of the bank put a pistol into his ing a raise of 5 in january he said pocket
 in case of a hold up and he and john if you will come to work for me i drove
 in a ford down to the optioned i ll give you 85 a month and ten farm when we arrived
 we found the percent of the commissions on all the owner an elderly foreign born lady from land you sell
 for me i was a timid central europe or thereabouts at the young sprout and hastened to get the back
 of the house washing with the advice of friends wife and even the aid of a scrubbing board and a
 wash deputy minister of agriculture george tub and without the least inclination harcourt who advised me to take mr to
 friendliness mr quigley explained quigley s offer as real estate conditions to her that he had come to take up
 the were sure to give great possibilities for option and had brought the money for mr jviddrie a resident of
 edmonton delivered this pu mer to time edmonton brunch of the society oti april 18 th 1962 1 the first

 it or discuss the deal mr pointed professor of horticulture owned quigley sued her for her refusal but jointly the
 double corner lot on 106 th late that fall the court dismissed his street and whyte avenue bought some action
 and awarded the old lady corn time before the boom for a fair and plete ownership of her land they
 ruled reasonable price another man with that th is old lady did not understand bulging pockets approached the two our
 language or our options it seems intellectuals and offered them a reported to me that the court was to be
 cam sum of 33 000 cash for the corner mended for its action in protecting an that s where the
 university men proved honest old lady as for mr quigley that they were better scholars than it was a blessing
 in disguise had he financiers the deal was refused and won he would have been faced with some years later
 the property reverted a heavy indebtedness after the crash to the city for taxes these are only came in the
 following year unless per passing examples of a ruinous boom that chance he resold it in the meantime brought in
 its train neither sense nor earlier in 1911 mr quigley had bought reason a quarter section of land from a
 mr fulton a part of which is now fulton mr quigley also owned a lot on place south of hardisty
 and capilano 104 th street a little north of the furnsubdivisions in 1912 fulton bought iture store between 80 th
 and 81 st back sixty acres for the same price as avenues he was offered 10 000 cash he had
 received for the 160 acres the for this property which had nothing on year before leaving the hundred acres it
 but an old building used for a clear profit for mr quigley chinese laundry to show the tenor even among
 some realtors mr quigley the spring of 1912 was furious with turned the offer down the city later real estate
 activity a number of busi took the lot for taxes to show how ness blocks were built during the sum
 furious the boom had become i even mer i recall the crawford block the sold five lots sloping down into
 the machine building corner of 102 nd street ravine at the east end of the old mill and 81 st
 avenue part of the commercial creek bridge these were sold on corn hotel the tipton block the hulbert mission for
 5 000 for elmer luck a block and the whyte block teacher at strathcona high school the terms were a
 quarter down six twelve building permits in 1912 amounted and eighteen on this deal the cash to 14 000 000
 not only an all time high down payment was all that was ever up to that year but a record
 for the paid as the boom had passed its peak next 34 years i can well remember before the next
 payment fell due anywhen going to work in the morning way my earnings of commissions hearing hammers pounding away on
 amounted to more than my wages new buildings in every direction there were something like 400 real estate in april
 elmer luck offered 1 800 a third six and twelve for any lot in offices in edmonton a city of
 approx garneau i made a similar offer and imately 31 000 in addition there were hosts of curb stone brokers
 selling on only once did i get any response mr the side many of our citizenry were quigley was over
 town one afternoon all too gullible some made money and and phoned me saying that he could many later lost
 it buy a lot in garneau for 1 800 a third six and twelve should he put a deposit for
 example the minister of the on it for me my reply was yes he strath cona baptist church was advised
 returned to the office in an hour or two to buy a lot on whyte avenue west but before he
 was back i had sold the of 111 th street if he could manage it property for 2 000 mr
 luck made so on the advice of honest and sincere enough out of his 1912 speculations to people he bought
 the lot what the sad take him to leipzig university germany outcome was i am unable to relate to study

 240 sold in the 1912 he revealed some disconcerting spring for 375 and up intelligence the alberta capital is all
 here is a sample of a typical newsthe talk there meaning winnipeg paper advertisement dressed up as a he said
 edmonton real estate is being bonanza millions have been made in sold as extensively there as any property the past
 few years in investments in in or around winnipeg they have some edmonton real estate these millions edmonton property listed
 there that have been made largely by small inlooks a little bit suspicious one sub vestors men and women who
 have had division in particular was shown on a only a small amount to invest but they beautifully colored map
 the property invested it at the right time and in the is actually not far from leduc and pros right
 place the time is now and the pective buyers are given a bird s eye place is fairmont the high
 road to view of edmonton from the blankety wealth price 75 and up 647 lots sold blank heights which are
 supposed to on the opening day this property is be in close proximity to the edmonton bordered on the east
 by 50 th street a city post office mile north of 137 th avenue and today to show how quickly
 paper profits is wholly within the municipality of were made a quarter section adjoining sturgeon in nearby mackenzie heights subdivision
 930 lots were offered at the country club in the west end pur 100 to 120 a piece on easy
 terms chased for 5 000 in 1910 sold in 1912 for 48 000 and the new owner offered this subdivision
 like its neighbor fairto sell it for 73 000 the man from mont is no longer a subdivision but whom
 he had bought the land obtained agricultural land in sturgeon municipalit 30 days earlier for 35 000 when the ity
 calder district was opened in the spring in downtown edmonton corner lots of 1912 it claimed to be the fastest
 at 101 st street and jasper avenue were growing suburb when the bronx sub selling for 2 000 per front
 foot and indivision opened 1 200 lots were sold in side lots brought anywhere from 1 0003 to 1 500
 subdivisions in all directions held the spying paid off one of the staked out their lots on ground that had
 number mr aitken caught sight of until then been productive farms some some hudson s bay co men carting a
 real estate offices went far afield and safe into a small ch urch hail on 103 rd promoted the sale
 cf lots in fort george street near the spot where taylor and b c tofield athabasca leduc cam pearson stands
 today so mr aitken rose and many other places the boom camped near the doorstep and george was everywhere kettyls
 was not too far behind men came from every direction like a swarm during the history of edmonton no of
 bees discovering an open honey hive event was ever as fantastic as the and stuck to their places throughout the
 hudson s bay co land sale that took night sitting on old chairs nail kegs place on may 12 1912
 this notorious inverted buckets or anything else that incident leaves me without suitable would support their posteriors on monadjectives to
 describe it one sunday day morning a young investor eager a young theological student george a to put his money
 into a h b c lot of kettyls told me a little of the inside fered george 130 for his
 place in line information relative to the sale of these george never the type to gamble too lots deeply turned
 the seat over to the new prospect and walked away with the the hudson s bay reserve is located 130
 i believe that the pressure was near the centre of the city extending so severe that the company went ahead
 originally from the river to 118 th avenue with the sale on the monday afternoon on the north and from
 101 st street to l 2 lst street on the west by 1912 most actually there were two sets of
 of the reserve had been bought as far tickets or lotteries the first one was as 107 th avenue the
 sale price per lot alloted to the first 1 500 standees or being about 25 the story goes that sitees
 these tickets were a sort of adthe pioneer merchants larue and picard mission to the grounds tickets when once got
 the corner lot on jasper avenue these 1 500 were assured of their place and 104 th street in trade
 for a pair of in th e line they drew another ticket to pants determine the order in which choice
 was to be granted there was no rela when the land boom appeared to tionship between the ticket establishing be
 at its height in the spring of 1912 the place in line and the ticket that the company decided to
 have a sale determined the position of the purchaser on april 24 th the newspapers carried for example the man
 who was at the the news that on tuesday may 12 at doorstep with number 1 in line drew 2
 00 p m there would be a sale of lots purchased ticket number 910 yet he but to heighten the
 excitement th ere had turned down 1 500 for his place would be a lottery on the monday bef ore
 in line the man who drew purchase the sale fifteen hundred tickets were ticket number 1 was 928 th in
 line he placed in a barrel and fifteen hundred was a retired farmer james walsh and investors would be allowed
 to take out was reported to have turned down one ticket each which would permit 27 000 for his purchase
 ticket a neat him to buy four lots however the of pocketful of money was made by a ficials of
 the sale decided to go under young visitor from winnipeg named ed ground and not announce the place of alexander
 ed s friends got him out ta the sale until the last minute so until the all night vigil where
 he drew ticket sunday afternoon nobody knew where number 5 and sold it the same day for the sale was
 to be held the curiosity 5 000 that killed the cat was nearly killing the prospective investors now it is
 here within a week barber shops pool that young george kettyls comes into rooms and drug stores were lined with
 the play he told us that he and some offers to sell less desirable tickets others were going out to
 do a little scout after some weeks the excitement died ing to find out if possible some clue as down
 and the company did not sell to the place where the sale was to be nearly all the lots that
 were ticketed edmontonians had grand ideas for a civic centre in 1915 the above sketches prepared by architects morell and
 nichols show the proposed centre looking south at left and looking north to put a little life into the sagging
 until many real estate doors closed for realty sale the h b c built the best keeps paved street in
 edmonton it was about eight lanes wide cutting diagonally one more incident must be told bethrough the reserve and the
 city built fore bringing this account to a close two lines of street car tracks along its in 1912 the
 city council began to study entire length they named the route the possibility of laying out a civic portage avenue
 and that was its name centre north of the civic block they until the royal visit in 1939 when the
 wanted to establish a big civic centre city council saw fit to change the name or metropolitan area surrounding a
 to kingsway a change which in my beautiful central lawn the city council mind was absolutely unnecessary the passed a
 resolution stopping the sale construction caused a flutter in the sale of any city owned land in the three of
 lots on each side of the street and it blocks north of the market square but seemed that the vacant
 expanse of it turned out that a third of the land was prairie was going to share in the city
 s owned by private citizens and several building program but after a year it of them were members of the
 city counwas easy to see that the whole project cil when the cost of purchasing the was falling flat and
 noth ing more could land was added up it totalled a shockbe done to raise it up unless the corn
 ing two and three quarter million pany undertook some sort of building dollars while many owners of these project this
 it did by building a cluster lots were rubbing their hands in hopeof homes around 109 th street and to
 ful anticipation of a fat and juicy deal the south of portage avenue the with a cornered city council it
 was not hudson s bay land sales gave to edmon until march 18 1913 that the council ton the peak
 of the boom and like the came out with a formal resolution the tail wagging the dog it broke the
 boom municipal council of the city of edmonton deems it advisable to establish a civic sporadic attempts were made to
 center being a park or open space for drag out the last dying gasps of the the purpose of building
 thereon various boom but it was only a matter of time buildings of a public or semi public nature and
 laying out said lands in after 1912 the decline was rapid an ornamental manner to raise the two years later
 the first world war two and three quarter million a fabu was upon us and soon many buildings bus sum
 in those days th e council both commercial and residential were went to the burgesses and put it to a
 empty a condition which ruined many vote the taxpayers with pockets but a property owner we rented our sixtoned tight
 would have no part of it roomed furnished house for 7 50 per and voted no so the real estate
 month rather than see it remain empty collapse came with deadly vengeance the city found itself the owner of and
 the city eventually took practically 75 000 lots which had reverted for unall the required lots for unpaid taxes paid
 taxes there were no more dreams had the plebiscite of 1913 passed the of easy money for many years the
 city of edmonton would have made its years 1913 1914 saw the boom pass last payment of the bond in

 1891 6 thompson s journey to the red deer river edited by hugh a dempsey in november 1800 scarcely more
 than three weeks after returning from a trip to meet the kootenai indians see albe ta historical review winter 1965
 pp 1 8 david thompson was off on another exploring expedition on nov 17 th he set out from rocky
 mountain house with duncan mcgillivray four employees and a peigan indian guide to visit the plains the main reasons for
 the journey were to explore the area to learn of possible mountain passes to determine the distance to the missouri
 and to gain permission from the peigans for iroquois and saulteaux trappers to enter their hunting grounds the eastern indians
 had been brought out by the north west company as trappers and boatmen thompson s trip took him south to
 the bow river at the present site of calgary south to the highwood north west to the present stony indian
 reserve and west to the seebe district there he and mcgillivray climbed a mountain before returning to rocky mountain house
 this was not thompson s first visit to the bow river country in september 1787 he had left manchester house
 on the north saskatchewan north east of the present lloydminster with a party of five other men they had travelled
 wsw passing eagle hills and finally reaching one pine in the vicinity of olds shortly afterwards they came in sight
 of the mountains and entered the chinook belt thompson mentioned the month of november was full as mild as th
 e month of october at the trading house the men crossed the bow river at a point thompson estimated to
 be thirty miles from the mountains and a short time later they met some peigan indians they accompanied them to
 their camp at an unspecified location and remained there for four months in the spring of 1788 thompson and the
 party returned to their fort after having made a successful trade with the indians during his trip in 1800 thompson
 was more precise about the route he followed however several points are in doubt often because thompson grossly overestimated his
 distances for example thompson s trip from the red deer river to the bow could not have been more than
 75 miles yet the total distance given in his journal is more than 100 miles fortunately certain landmarks make it
 possible to correct most of his calculations although his route cannot be followed with complete precision the original journal entitled
 journey to the bow river and rocky mountain is in the ontario archives and is published here with the kind
 permission of its archivist throughout the text thompson s original spelling is retained and punctuation is added only where required
 for clarity the only exception is the word course which he sometimes abbreviated to co for clarity th is word
 is spelled out in full any further additions to the original text are contained in square brackets ‘ glower richard

 countrymen ha ling started at 7 o clock saturday morning taking with him a small flag to wave when ‘
 he got to the summit on arriving there he waved his flag b ut both he and flag were too
 small objects to be seen by those who were watching with field glasses ha ling arrived at camp at 12
 30 noon just taking five hours and a half thereby winning the bet the chinese who lost the bet having
 doubts that ha ling ever got to the top of the peak it was agreed that before paying over the
 money several of those interested should go up with him the following day and if the flag was found on
 top the mountain would be handed over to ha ling accordingly the next day they ascended the peak being led
 by ha ling and on this occasion they took with them a 12 foot pole and flag six feet square
 on gaining the top ha ling s little flag was proudly flapping its tiny form to the breeze proof positive
 that ha ling had won the bet the chinese set up their flag pole and unfurled their scarlet flag to
 the breeze and proceeded to descend from the giddy heights which was safely accomplished under the guidance of ha ling
 the flag and flagstaff can now be seen by the naked eye as the peak has no name let it

 new museum by sheilagh s jameson alberta has reached an age of maturity during the first decades of the country
 s history its people like those of any frontier land were mainly men of action in those building years the
 urgency of the present and vision for the future precluded much thought of yesterday when a country reaches the point
 where it ceases to be completely preoccupied with the activities of the present and concerns itself with gathering and preserving
 fragments of the past it is laying a foundation upon which to build a better future alberta has attained that
 point in recent years albertans have become acutely aware of their history the varied cultures which they represent and of
 the necessity for preserving them a striking manifestation of this interest in history was the opening in calgary in december
 1964 of the glenbow foundation alberta government museum this museum is a joint project the history and mineralogy the primary

 22 the roundup of 1887 alfred e cross it was about june 1 1887 after the most severe and disastrous
 winter ever experienced in the cattle ranching history of north america reaching along the prairies east of the rocky mountains
 from mexico to the bow river in the north west territories of canada few of the ranchers lost less than
 40 per cent some losing 100 many losing 75 per cent the round up met at what was then known
 as the high river crossing composed of a stopping house a goodsized stable and stockade corral all built of logs
 this old stopping house was run by buck smith who used to whittle sticks being one of the habits of
 many old timers while he related his wonderful experiences in hunting buffalo poker and an occasional bottle of mail being
 so far removed from the red eye were the principal attractions outside world and living so close to the stage
 and mail coach running from nature with all the freedom of the usi calgary to fort macleod called at the
 bounded prairie without a living soul it had been a wonderful fascination if you ever experienced it you can never
 get free from a longing desire to experi ence it again the high river round up was composed of two
 complete round up outfits the most important was known as the bar u which was owned and operated by the
 north west cattle company with fred stimson as manager and george lane foreman fred stimson was a unique character known
 from the atlan tic to the pacific more especially in the ranching country both north and south of the boundary
 line he was also well a known arcund the eastern township wh ere he was born in the province of
 quebec and in montreal where he caused endless amusement with his wonderful stock of western stories i was fortunate to
 have the privilege of spending a few days with him in the old city of quebec where he had lived
 in his youthful days he was received with open arms of real genuine welcome by everyone especially the ladies i
 al ways look back with great joy to those days of exquisite pleasure spent with a e cross such hospitable
 people george lane then foreman of the crossing once or twice a week going bar u outfit was boss of
 the high rivet each way men in those days did not round up and a strict autocrat with al seem
 very much interested even in the cowboys his word was law and nc mr cross owner of the a 7
 ranch and founder of calgary brewing and multi g co lid gave thi paper to a n eetimmg of the
 calgary historical society in decen ber 1923 23 one disputed it he was widely known the little bow and highwood
 rivers over most of north america especially with tom lynch as wagon boss and the west and down into mexico
 even captain of the roundup while we were reaching as far as old france from by ourselves we were all
 young and where he imported some of the finest full of beans except lynch and old percheron horses ever produced
 in ad nigger green the cook and one other dition to this he became probably the the mosquito creek pool
 outfit went largest grain growing farmer in canada east from high river crossing heading and one of th e biggest
 cattle ranchers for the mouth of the bow river taking a strip of country about 40 miles wide a description
 of the bar u outfit as we went would not be complete without including a noted old timer george emerson
 the on the way down we had some pilot who always rode in front of the amusing experiences with wild
 bronchos wagons on a fine horse showing where most of us had a large proportion that to camp and get
 water george was were not even decently halter broke and the expert calf marker cutting the under had only been
 ridden a couple of times butt from one ear and the under half it can be readily imagined what would
 crop on the other to perfection emerson happen wh en about a hundred and was one of the oldest old
 timers in the twenty were run into the rope corral west coming up from maine or vermont made up with
 two wagons and two of in the 1860 s and for years freighting the best ropers were told to catch
 and from fort garry to edmonton with an work the riders horses outfit of red river carts about the second
 day out hunter the sheep creek ranch company powell who was a beautiful roper and which also worked with the
 bar u one of the best cow hands that ever wagon was under direction of john came to the country
 caught one of my barter one of the most powerful and bronchos he was a particularly active forceful men of
 the west and an old four or five year old well bred and full time hudson s bay man the
 story is of life when the noose of hunter s rope related of a wild longhorn steer making settled round
 his neck several of us for him in the corral and not giving him made a dive to grab the
 end of the time to jump the bars he turned lariat but were too late he had a grabbed a
 horn in each hand and gave straight run out of the rope corral the steer such a twist that its
 neck getting right away rawhide rope and cracked like a pistol shot unfortunately broncho disappearing over the prairie typhoid attacked
 him and he was one like a violent chinook wind of the first persons buried in the calgary this was
 the last we saw of him cemetery the horse was found a couple of months this leads one to barter
 s right hand after but the rope was gone he afterman john ware the finest negro i wards made a
 splendid mount for one have ever met a splendid cow hand of the north west mounted police i and the
 greatest broncho rider in the was not sorry to see him disappear i west it was like a snubbing post
 when had a string of 10 but only two were a broncho came up against the end of gentle the
 balance gave me a terrible john s lariat he was a beautiful roper time and a perfect horseman he was
 taught they used to josh me saying that by his owner when a boy in slavery i talked in my
 sleep about the various days as the story goes the master buckers and particularly a grey one made all his
 boys ride the bronchos which afterward also went to the bareback giving them an awful licking mounted police i shall
 never forget with a black snake if they dared to fall when riding this grey one day having off so
 it is hardly necessary to say that a bad time keeping the saddle john they were expert riders ware rode
 up saying let me ride that the other roundup outfit was known boss you bet i changed onto his gentle

 the one evening we had a little bunch prairie would get the horses into camp of cattle camped on the
 prairie about and that the rest of us could return 75 miles from the nearest human being there he directed
 us and we returned the cattle were quieted down in sight of to the camp where after waiting camp the
 only horse saddled was that anxiously until after dark hunter and of the day wrangler jimmy johnson henry quietly walked

 someone caught and picketed a horse that night shouted that the horse had broken loose that evening when we lost

 and after several hours at their longest so we all started there we tried to find the trail of the
 wagon were about a dozen of us but one after but could see no sign of it another they dropped
 behind it is at about one o clock th e sun came out probably conceited to say this but i
 for a minute i remember that we argued herded off the bunch and had them about which way it went
 however stopped when some of the others caught we decided that it had gone its usual up course and we
 found a new survey line 25 and got our proper directions i felt various directions so that all the country
 certain we would cross the wagon trail was carefully covered and very few as it had to go south but
 there were cattle were missed when all the cattle no signs of it so we kept travelling east were rounded
 up they were put into and came to the confluence of the bow three bunches of about a thousand head

 even ago in czarist russ a to its eventual covered the absent leader sorokin in migration to canada at the
 turn of this far off uruguay a little over a decade century from the rugged early periods ago this reviewer
 was a member of the of settlement largely in what is now ubc doukhobor research ccmmittee for saskatchewan to the
 migration of a a year and therefore knows something large segment still further west to the about the complexity and
 difficulty of kootenays of british columbia and the researching a group like the sons of schisms in the group with
 the emergence freedom so full credit goes to the of the radical wing upon which this book author for her
 tremendous work and focuses this is a story of a complex effort yet one can t help but wonder group
 of religious fanaticism of re about the representativeness of her fusals to conform to public schooling sample of interviews documents
 repaying taxes and other social norms of sources the larger society of spectacular protests the author has an exciting style
 ol of arson and nudism when pressured and the author does an eye catching writing thus her book reads easily
 and job of writing a most exciting book well like a fascinating spy story or murder mystery but this gives
 rise to but what kind of a book is this a an uneasiness that there may be too personal account
 of a group one has much journalism slipped in to interfere gotten to know quite well or is it a
 with the objective historical analysis novel a sort of social science fiction the truth for example pathetic warped combining factual
 and documentary people or i talked to terrorists italics materials with the freedom of going be mine these indicate that
 in the guise yond the facts to round out the story of innocent descriptions she has gra or is it
 an historical and analytical ac tuitously tossed in judgments intercount of the sons of freedom one which spersed with accounts
 from records are we are to take seriously as authentic dramatic dialogues simulating the con to proceed with appropriateness as
 well tent alid tone of what the author has as fairness the reviewer must know the perceived as the event
 which took place nature of the book he is reviewing fcr true this makes for more lively reading tunately the
 author herself offers the but the reader is literally led by the objectives when she states in the intro nose
 to the conclusions the author wishes duction this book is written in the to establish hope that truth will halt
 the perpetual destruction of children in the amoral for the social scientist a most serious violent world of the sons
 of freedom shortcoming stems from the author s in doukhobors it became a mission sistance on the equivalence of fact
 with for me to reveal what i know is the truth to illustrate an event may have truth in the
 hope that out of this can occurred and documentary evidence come some answers to what has been may establish that
 event as a fact but for two centuries an insoluble and at what is the meaning or effect of that
 times untenable problem this book fact this calls for interpretation which then is intended by her to be an his
 means in the context of the situation torical account of the sect and the social mores values and motivations truth
 behind the canadian problem within which the event occurred thus associated with the sons when the author states those who
 survived peter s pressures became stronger this reviewer read terror with some pioneers more determined to be successmixed feelings on
 the one hand there ful and self sufficient p 41 or many 31 stirred by sensational and irresponsible situation and
 not as the truth for those writing and broadcasting mistakenly who wish to explore one would do well wept for
 the doukhobor children at that to compare this book with hawthorn time p 295 these are her conclu ed time
