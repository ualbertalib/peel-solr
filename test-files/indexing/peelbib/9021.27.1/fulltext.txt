 capital stock was issued for petroleum lands situated on lesser slave river athabaska from mr e r kent one of
 the members of the company who obtained his title from the original discovers osborn smith and cameron who were granted
 their title from the dominion government the title is therefore indisputable and the stock non assessible the capital is 1
 000 000 the property of this company consists of 320 acres of petroleum land situated on the lesser slave river
 four miles from the athabasca into which it rum is both these rivers are navigable up to the property of
 the company for the largest class of vessels and a steamboat is now being built by the hudson s bay
 company to run on them the route from the petroleum fields at present is by these rivers to athabasca landing
 110 miles thence by land over a level prairie road about fifty miles to a point above edmonton on the
 north branch of the saskatchewan river which flows into lake winnipeg thus making connection with winnipeg and prince albert and
 other towns in its course and connecting with the south saskatchewan which crosses the c p r at medicine hat
 surveyors of the c p r have been engaged during the past season running lines west and north of the
 athabasca river which runs within a mile of the projected territory as soon as the road from this city to
 hudsons bay and the c p r to port moody and british columbia is built as it undoubtedly will be
 within a couple of years this petroleum property will be as contiguous to liverpool as the petroleum fields of pennsylvania
 now are and two thousand miles nearer the pacific coast china and japan judging from the surface indications of the
 petroleum fields where gum is immense quantities can be seen in patches to a larger or smaller extent over the
 whole territory and where petroleum exudes from the bank all along and flowing down the river front for about two
 miles and showing along both banks of the creeks which run through the middle and into the lot and divides
 it and finding the same indications of gum and oil in pools at the back part of the lot at
 the bottom of some rising ground nearly a mile from the river front the company claim these indications prove beyond
 a doubt that large reservoirs of petrolurn must exist below and that inexhaustible supplies will be found by boring for
 it the directors have concluded to develop the property by putting down wells the general manager has gone east so
 as to make the necessary purchases of machinery to effect these objects it is the company s intention to prosecute
 the work vigorously as there are no obstacles to prevent work being done at any time of the year the
 company claim that never has there been a more promising petroleum territory discovered than that now owned by them and
 they are confident that there is a big bonanza in store winnipeg times nov 21 1883 buffalo bone industry in

 a living into 1887 when more bones were shipped during the next three years they brought in from moose jaw
 than from any other point over 100 carloads of bones to charles reid in canada the town merchant removing the
 last traces mr plante continued to purchase buffalo of the great bison herds that had once wanbones through 1888 12

 jaw had been picked clean so the other metis to the west were filling their prairie scavengers were forced to
 range far carts and trailing to maple creek the south in quest of the buffalo remains their buyers in that
 area were the dixon brothers efforts in this area brought mr baker about local merchants who dealt in practically every
 imaginable good it is not known brothers for the bones so laden and just when these men first began handling

 of bones to railway sidings between lumsden and the end of the line 52 other metis unable to find work
 near battleford began collecting the buffalo bones that lay between the elbow of the north branch and the south saskatchewan
 river 5 by fall they and other prairie gleaners were said to have delivered as many as 50 000 heads
 at saskatoon together with as many of the other bones of the carcasses as the pickers could find 54 w
 h duncan had opened a store at saskatoon in 1890 and as the pickers began bringing wagonloads of bones into
 town he offered to take them in trade for goods the idea was readily accepted by the metis since barter
 was a way of life with them so hundreds of tons of bison remains were hauled to duncan s market
 in exchange for credit 55 from distances of up to 15 miles the pickers came with their cargoes eager to
 receive from the pioneer merchant between 5 00 and 7 00 per ton sg duncan left records indicating that his
 bone business attained rather impressive dimensions for his diary showed four carloads of skeletons shipped out on september 6 1890

 in the course of supplying this demand for bones the pickers were constantly searching for new areas to exploit one
 such tract was the qu appelle valley an area that was literally white with buffalo bones in 1889 stimulated by
 an offer of 7 00 a ton for these relics by messrs crawford osment of indian head the metis began
 scouring the district for bones 5 their labors soon had five carloads of skeletons heaped up at the station and
 more were coming in almost daily the following year saw about twice the volume and six on the 17 th
 as the trade in bison remains progressed in 1890 the volume of sun bleached relics brought in to saskatoon exceeded
 the capacity of the railroad to haul them away when this occurred the bone dealers were forced to stack their
 investments along the sidings at the station while additional supplies of freight cars were sought the unshipped skeletons were organized
 into neat rectangular piles about eight feet wide eight feet high and 33 feet long the same dimensions as a
 boxcar thus making it easy for the owners to take inventory of the stock on hand 58 each rick was
 constructed by interlocking the horns on the assembled with h a axford cornering most of the business 5 by the
 middle of 1 890 nearly all of the readily accessible bones had been mustered at the indian head depot leaving
 many pickers waiting for one of several proposed branch lines to open up new areas for their trade one region
 that the pickers looked forward to exploiting was the country between the qu appelle valley and the saskatchewan river in
 1890 rails were laid out of regina across this skeleton littered terrain toward the town of saskatoon and bone scavengers
 assembled all along the right ofbuffalo skulls to form a perimeter with the loose bones making up the centre at

 in 1894 in galicia in the village of probizna western ukraine then occupied by the austro hungarian regime he was
 the oldest of a family of eight children and learned from an early age that hard work and hunger went
 hand in hand a bright student he finished eight classes in four years of school but from then on he
 began to shoulder a workload that would have taxed a much older and stronger boy at 12 years of age
 he went to work on the czar s highway levelling gravel on the roadbed for this he was paid 40
 cents a day the following winter he was hired to shovel snowdrifts on the same highway earning 30 cents a
 day in the spring when he was considered older and stronger he was put to work hauling gravel by wheelbarrow
 to fill in holes and ruts in the road caused by melting snows all his earnings went into the family
 coffers young as he was the boy accepted his lot in life knowing that in a small way he was
 helping his parents in their struggle for survival in the next few years he worked at van ous jobs he
 planted trees in a government reforestation plan he hired out to wealthy polish landowners to work in their fields at

 brushed off howsheaf of grain he cut and tied as nick grew older it became more apparent that there would
 never be a future for him in his homeland his father owned ever once the idea had taken root in
 his five morgs of land about seven acres and mind he could not get rid of it it became when
 time came to subdivide it among eight a battle of wills between father and son children there would hardly be

 were thoroughly disillusioned nick watched advised to keep on going their baggage them comparing this to the railroad work would
 be delivered to them by boat later he d done last year in alberta nick felt in the season left
 with nothing but the sick he d worked hard last year but at clothes on their backs they waited out
 the least the work was clean hoping that somecold mountain night huddled around a where along the route they would
 find more camp fire this was the first of many such tolerable conditions the six men continued nights to come
 the journey during the day the men ploughed in the meanwhile other men discouragthrough deep slushy snow wetting their ed
 by the walking were dropping off by foot gear and clothes at night it turned twos and threes at each
 succeeding station cold and everything froze without blan at mile 166 the only remnants of the kets or change of

 here the guide informed them that scrambling up hills and down ravines they as far as he was concerned this
 was the were tired enough to fall asleep sitting on end of the line they d had their opporlogs around
 the fire tunities same as the others now they were they arrived at the first station soon on their own
 after leaving tete juane cache labourers hungry and tired another full day s walk were busy working on a large
 mountain behind them the men entered camp and side cut snows melting under a warm sun asked for something to
 eat but the guide turned the work area into a quagmire men had already passed along the word they working
 in rubber hip boots operated a were told since they weren t anxious to steam shovel which scooped up mud
 and work there was nothing for them in camp debris and dumped it into a rail car mount the contractor
 was under no further obligaed on a narrow gauge railway there were tion to provide them with meals two tracks
 and a switch as well as two lighting a fire at the edge of the campcars when one car was
 full a horse pulled site they spent the night shivering with cold and hunger at daybreak they set out paying

 had to they were barely dragging their feet they buy their own shovels axes saw axle sat down dejectedly contemplating
 their grease blasting powder and dynamite for next move their weariness must have blasting tree stumps and rocks the conshown

 them of rail in lieu of payment the sub con why the sad faces one of them asked tractors agreed
 to provide their own men it was a familiar tongue and sounded like for dumping the cars and building the
 dump music to their ears they were charged 1 00 a day for board if you only knew how hungry
 we are per man a total of 300 a month nick replied we haven t eaten since yes because of
 the consistency of the clay terday morning and have two days walking provisions had to be made to ensure a
 solid behind us footing for the tracks as well as the horse the man shook his head to prevent the
 cars from toppling over in the soft mud the men first had to cut logs you won t get anything
 here either and lay them lengthwise on top of these unless you re working in camp that s com they
 laid the ties crosswise to provide a pany rule even if you were to starve to solid base for the
 tracks for the same rcadeath son they built a sidewalk for the horse so what do we do now we
 re too hun after supper the men prepared for next gry to walk any further day s work the snow
 cover was shovelled come and work with us there s four off rails extended when necessary switch of us we
 ve taken a sub contract and can changed rocks and stumps blasted and use all six of you various other
 jobs that would otherwise it didn t take long to convince the hun take time away from hauling fill the
 work gry men they agreed to join the group they had undertaken was no better than that was how nick
 and his friends be the labour they had passed up at the other came employees of a sub contractor having
 stations along the way snow remained in agreed to work they were given food and the mountains until the end
 of may then that night they fell into a deep sleep too it melted and ran in streams down the
 tired to even notice the bare wooden bunks mountain sides soon the men wallowed in mud up to their knees
 the men were now under agreement to build a dump for the railroad bed and to living conditions in camp
 also were bad haul approximately 8 000 cubic yards of the bunkhouse was made of logs with a dirt the
 cut bank was 700 feet long but canvas top with no windows for ventilanot long enough to merit the use
 of a steam tion there were two rows of bunk beds shovel so the loading was to be all done
 along the walls with a stove in the middle by hand the cut was composed of a layer altogether 22
 men lodged there including of sand a layer of yellow clay and finally 12 hungarians plus nick s friends at
 a layer of a sticky substance called blue night the air inside became intolerable clay men working and sweating all
 day long developed unpleasant body odours while after an engineer surveyed a cut he while socks drying on an overhead
 rail adestimated the depth of each strata in the ded to the smell there were no facilities proposed cut for
 hauling this to the dump for bathing and the river was two miles the men were to be paid 25
 cents a yard away too far to walk after a long day s for the sand 38 cents a yard
 for clay and work the bunks were covered with cedar 1 00 a yard for the blue clay dump cans
 boughs which unless renewed regularly were to be filled by hand then hauled by dried and added to the overall
 mess and horse along a narrow gauge railway to the dirt dump there were two sets of tracks and the
 food too was poor shipped in from a switch while one car was being emptied edmonton it came by barge
 from tete the other car was being filled jaune cache and took days in transponta the sub contractors now composed
 of tion without any means of refrigeration ten men rented a horse from the contractor meat began to spoil before
 it reached camp and upon arrival it was stored for future sulphur matches boil them and use the use in
 a hole dug in the ground by the water for bathing the itch after three time it reached the table
 it was fully ripe months of suffering nick felt the first mea hungry as the men were the unpleasant sure
 of relief however the itch did not smell of rotten meat was more than they clear completely until after they
 had finishcould endure rather than eat it they tos ed their contract and were on their way to sed it
 out before they helped themselves to fort george at one of the deserted camps the steady fare of beans and
 hard cheese along the way nick found a paper bag of there were never potatoes or eggs and even sulphur
 after that he washed himself frethe bread which was baked in the makeshift quently in sulphur water until the infection
 camp stove was half raw and often inedible disappeared the men would have walked off the job the bedrolls and
 baggage did not reach had they not been under contract for they them until mid july when word came to
 were to be paid only if the work was corn pick them up at a point on the river two
 pleted rather than forfeit the hours of miles from camp men dropped whatever sweat and toil they had already put
 in they they were doing and ran for their longstuck it out for the remainder of the sum awaited belongings
 at last there would be men a change of clothes during this time nick developed an itch however when they
 looked at the bags on his arms and body he had no change no one was able to recognize his
 own for of clothes as the baggage was still missing they had been picked over by men in other and
 aggravated by sweat dirt and chafing camps one by one the men picked the the rash festered and the skin
 turned raw ones that looked best to them some had as there was no doctor in camp he suffer tags
 with names almost obliterated by rain cd in silence too embarassed even to tell and wear and tear in transportation
 while his friends it was fortunate that an older others had no tags whatever nick picked man noticed his condition
 for he advised a cardboard valise with a blanket tied on nick to wash in a sulphur solution since the
 outside inside he found two white there was no sulphur to be had in camp shirts two pair of socks
 a towel and a the next best thing was to buy a box of razor he was particularly thankful for
 the blanket and towel everybody wants bread but we have for the duration of the summer life in none to
 sell many people come through camp never improved rains fell mosqui here but we have only a small supply of
 toes multiplied by the millions and there flour it must last us until we finish the was complete isolation from
 the rest of the job sorry but we re not in the baking world in camp there were hungarians business
 we haul gravel portuguese japanese swedes poles rus thus dismissed they continued their sians and ukrainians differences arose journey on
 empty stomachs two more days among them sometimes not only words passed before hunger and weariness finally were exchanged but
 blows as well still caught up with nick in his exhausted conthe days passed and by the end of august
 dition he started to run a temperature and work at the station drew to a close to had an overpowering
 desire to fall asleep complete the project nick and his friends at last it came to a point where he
 gave had to leave a clean work site they re up and refused to go any further he found moved
 the logs and ties and burned them a comfortable spot under a fir tree and levelled the grade and then
 dug ditches hoped his companions wouldn t miss him along either side of the new dump only no sooner had
 he closed his eyes however when all was done did the construction when two of his friends came back to
 haul engineer give them an estimate of amount him to his feet holding him up they dragof fill hauled the
 total value of work done ged him along with them they even tried was 4 000 to cheer him telling
 him that food and then came the calculation of expenses fort george couldn t be much further away after deduction
 for board equipment sup that evening they reached a camp that plies etc the men had 1 218 left over
 was still in operation by this time nick for five months of work broken down into was delirious as his
 friends lay him down days worked by each individual it amount on the floor of a bunkhouse expecting the ed
 to as little as 65 for two men who d worst booked off sick often others received from during the
 night someone brought him 96 to 154 the highest sum went to the a crust of bread but nick was
 too sick to four original sub contractors who d worked eat he fell asleep and slept through the the longest
 nick received 128 for 128 night when he woke up in the morning days of back breaking toil a dollar
 a day the fever was gone he felt weak and shaky no more no less but the will to live
 was with him again and if the men had expected to be paid in hearing that fort george was only
 five cash they soon found out they were mis miles away was the best news he d had in taken
 instead they were given a time sheet a week mustering his last ounce of strength and statement to cover their
 work they and with some help from his companions then had to go to the main office in fort nick
 reached their destination shortly be george for their money they packed their fore noon fort george was a scattering of
 few belongings and soon after breakfast log buildings and ramshackle sheds but it started out unable to buy food for
 the was a welcome change from the empty road they dreaded the prospect of the 103 wilderness the place was
 home to a handmile walk to fort george on empty stom ful of permanent residents and a stopping achs but
 luck was with them the first night place for numerous transients locating the when they came to a camp willing
 to sell company office the men turned in their them supper statement and time sheets collected their next morning they
 set out after break pay and went in search of an eating place fast and walked all day only to
 find camp they found a restaurant near the river after camp deserted to appease their grow where food was prepared
 in a log shanty ing hunger they picked berries along the and served on a long table under the open
 way two days later they were still living sky at 35 cents a plate they enjoyed their on berries only
 at one place did they come first full meal in many days across a small group of men working they
 their next objective was to buy a few were russians hauling gravel nick and clothes and then clean up they
 found a his friends saw their outdoor oven and ask store that carried underwear shirts overed if they could buy
 a loaf of bread alls shoes and other apparel each invested one of the men shrugged his shoulders a few
 dollars in a change of clothes then went back to the river to bathe and dress than planned and the
 resulting avalanche discarding their rags and tatters they em wrecked the tunnel sending the rail car erged out of the
 bush feeling like human tumbling into the river following this misbeings after so many month of dirt and hap the
 boss ordered his helpers back to deprivation clean up the mess but the men refused as small as fort george
 was it was no they had no wish to be buried alive by different from other frontier town boot still
 another slide they quit instead three leggers sold whiskey at 20 a bottle men weeks after starting on their new
 job they played poker and gambled away their hard were on their way back to fort george earned money fights
 broke out through the fall season was fast advancing nights the day and late into the night men talked were
 cooler and rains fell the four partand exchanged their experiences with in ners bought a few more extras including ends
 and strangers another set of underwear and mitts they for three days and nights nick and his then bought several
 loaves of bread and friends stayed in fort george but with cheese for the road back to tete jaune meals
 at 1 00 a day and lodging at 1 00 cache on the third day out rain began a night
 they knew they could not afford to fall in earnest and the men were forced to stay too long without
 work on the to seek shelter under some firs until it stopmorning of the fourth day they split into ped
 later they found that the heavy rain three groups their four new friends went had made the grade impossible for
 walking their way while two of nick s companions as sticky mud hampered each footstep wanted to head back to
 tete jaune cache either they would have to wait for it to and home nick threw in his lot with
 the dry or they could walk along the embankthree remaining men who had decided to ment where windfalls and thick
 brush prego west where they heard some swedes sented its own kind of barrier they were were looking for men
 to work on a daily saved from making a decision by the hoot basis of a steamboat on the river
 setting out the new camp was 28 miles west of fort immediately in the direction of the sound george on
 reaching their destination they they found the boat docked and unloading found the company consisted of eight goods on the
 river bank nick and his corn swedes who had a contract to blast and rades approached the captain and asked
 clear a right of way along the side of a him if he d take them along he agreed on
 mountain they had a side cut started with payment of 2 50 per person to take them five separate tunnels
 bored into the moun as far as the canyon 14 miles away shorttam later the tunnels were filled with ly
 before reaching the mouth of the canyon blasting powder and dynamite all were the men were dropped off the captain
 showconnected to a single battery which enabled ing them where to bypass the canyon and them to set off the
 blasts at the same time its waterfall at the other end he told them the resulting explosion brought down a
 there would be a gasoline boat waiting big chunk of mountain and tumbled it into should they want further transportation
 the adjoining chekako river nick s group following his directions they arrived above of four was then given the job
 of expand the falls where for another 6 50 the gasing a tunnel making it large enough for oline boat
 operator offered to take them the tracks and rail car to be used in haul 18 miles to a point
 near the new division ing gravel the men timbered the tunnel at mcbride rather than face another long as they
 worked making a sturdy log ceil walk the men decided to fork over the ing with a trap door for
 overhead loading money but even after the trip they still then when two of the helpers pushed had to go
 some distance before eventually the car in one of the swedes would open meeting a steel gang working out of
 mc bride the trap door and start a stream of loose gravel flowing into the car when it was arriving
 at camp that night they went full more men joined to push the car out to the construction office where
 they were and dump the gravel on the grade accepted for work and permitted to join when loose gravel stopped
 coming down the company workers at the supper table on its own the company man set off an next morning
 the new arrivals were assignother small blast however one day the ed to their various duties nick s job was
 explosion moved more of the mountain to pound spikes into the newly laid ties at the rate of 25 cents
 an hour for a ten hour day the steel gang averaged two miles of track per day working conditions were
 more tolerable than those of summer and though the men lacked medical attention most of them survived only the odd
 wooden cross at the side of the rade bespoke of death by accident or sickness with the cooler weather meals
 also improved there was less spoilage and more variety so the workers were less discontented work progressed steadily until the
 railroad finally reached fort george during the second week of january 1914 railroad construction was then sn pended until the
 bridge across the fraser river was completed on the steel gang nick found a new friend joe andruski who was
 two years his senior a close comradeship developed between the two men based upon a mutual liking and respect joe
 was much taller and stronger than nick so he soon assumed the role of big brother for which nick had
 many occasions to be thankful they also learned to share their problems as well as their trust in each other
 when work on the steel gang drew to a close at fort george the company asked the men to wait
 until the new bridge across the fraser river was finished however it did not offer to keep the men in
 food and lodging in the meantime at 2 00 a day their earnings would soon be gone rather than wait
 it out nick and joe decided to quit while they were ahead they picked up their pay at the office
 and were given a free pass for the length of one division others of their group learning of their decision
 decided to quit too the company paid them but refused to hand out any more free passes a group of
 seven started out on foot from fort george carrying food for the road and a supply of tobacco and matches
 the sky was overcast and they were soon heading into a snowstorm it fell heavy and wet at first then
 turned colder their clothes froze as did their shoes but there was no stopping along the way until they found
 shelter at midnight they came to a box car on a siding when they slid open the door they discovered
 others who had taken shelter and were now snoring soundly the car was cold but at least the men were
 out of the wind bone tired after many on their retur from constr uction work in the mountains nick gill
 right and his friend anton smerchensky had their photographs taken in edmonton in january 1914 hours of plowing through heavy
 snow the newcomers fell asleep too oblivious of the freezing temperature inside the half filled coal car nick awoke later
 to find joe shaking him and shouting in his ear get up everybody wake up before you freeze to death
 through the partly open door nick saw the flicker of fire light outside wakened earlier by the bone chilling cold
 inside the car joe had built a bonfire before waking up the others one by one the men got up
 making their way on stiffened legs to the warmth of the fire on second count they found one man missing
 young mike hamaliuk was too far gone to wake up on his own so joe carried him out while the
 others made room for him by the fire it took a vhile for him to thaw out but in the
 end against the wall wrapped themselves in ie was none the worse for the experience their blankets and prepared to
 fall asleep rhe rest of the crew covered with coal before long loud shouts and threats brought lust huddled like
 chimney sweeps around them back to reality a trainman demandhe blazing fire breaking their fast by shar ed a dollar
 from each of them for allowing ng pieces of bread them to stay on for those who were asleep at
 the first sign of daylight they set out he administered a kick to wake them up again walking for miles
 before they reach tired and hungry all the men wanted ed the next siding where there was a small was
 to get to civilization where they could station while warming up around a fire buy a meal and find a
 warm place to sleep a train with ten flat cars and a caboose when they all paid up the trainman
 was pulled in from fort george on its way to 30 richer as soon as the train began tete jaune
 cache a number of transients moving the men dozed off again were hitching a ride on one of the flat
 cars nick woke up a little later shivering so nick s party joined them glad for a with cold the
 box car seemed to be at a chance to get a rest from walking stand still and when he slid
 open the door it wasn t long before a trainman emerg he discovered that the engine was gone ed from
 the railway station with a revolver the car had been shunted off at the next in his hand he motioned
 for the men to siding and left there outside it was pitch get off and one by one they left
 all except dark and cold waking his partner they nick and joe built a fire and spent the remainder of
 the night replenishing it while soaking up its what makes you bastards any differ warmth at the first sign of
 daylight they cnt he roared started out again a few hours later they the two men pulled out their passes
 and were overjoyed to have reached the division showed him he motioned them into the point at mcbride caboose just
 as the train gathered speed the town had grown since the previous having ascertained that no one had jumped fall
 they found a stopping place where back on again the trainman returned to they bought a hot meal and lodging
 for the the caboose and still flourishing his re night a passenger train was due to leave volver he ordered
 nick and joe out onto the following day so they bought tickets the flatcar there to keep from freezing and
 arrived in edmonton on jan 20 1914 in the bitter cold they kept running back for nine months of work
 nick had less and forth along the length of the car some than 200 to show for his labours it
 was 40 miles later the train came to a stop and several years before he felt he had enough the
 men were ordered off saved to establish himself on a farm in once again they started walking by the meanwhile
 he had more experiences nightfall they reached still another siding as a railroader and later still as miner in where
 they found a single boxcar hitched drumheller after he left the mines he to a stationary engine seeking shelter for
 farmed for many years becoming a model the night they climbed into the car where farmer and taking an interest
 in public they found others who had the same idea affairs and farm organizations in later nick counted 28 men
 they found a space years he retired to edmonton salvation army the salvation army was the great attraction yesterday early
 in the morning they commenced operations by a hallelujah feast at the barracks from 10 to 11 o clock they
 paraded the streets led by capt young and his concertina and singing the catchy airs which are the chief feature

 certain that my brother ben got him on a trade now sleepy shuffle was also intended to lull the ben
 was a top rider and while the colonel rider into a little siesta too for three times took a bit
 of breaking my brother did not the old rascal tried to catch me napping mind and by letting him buck
 a little every and always at top of a steep little hill time he got on him he was guaranteed
 down would go his head his neck would that no one else would ride him if he hap disappear between
 his legs and i would pened to be away be looking at a lot of nothing below the one 24

 you never rode his belated doging was no problem for the nor will ride a better one and clem did
 colonel and another steer went to join not disagree the cut the colonel lived to a great age great the
 colonel was very fast and won many for a horse that is which is all too short little races at

 not a gross violation of the queen s regulations as well as an outrage on religious liberty besides being most

 empire religious liberty is the most carefully guarded of all rights and that in all things the rights of a
 private soldier are as sacred as those of a commanding officer they should not forget in whose employ they are
