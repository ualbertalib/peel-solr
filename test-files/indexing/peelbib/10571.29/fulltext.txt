 the patrician 5 editor s notes the patrician is published later than usual this year this was the result of 
 the change of command at the depot and the disruption of normal routine caused by new procedures involved in the 
 transfer of the depot from alberta area to training command 0:com 0:mand i think we have all now learned our 
 new jobs there is a lot of work involved in the production of the patrician and we offer our special 
 thanks to lt col l w basham for his kind interest and many helpful suggestions to lts v d cole 
 and r j gillis for their work on the compilation of the book to rsm d i t roe and 
 sgt moseley c a for maintaining statistics and to mrs j r d falconer who as a clerk at the 
 depot maintains our association files and takes a keen interest in her task in the process of doing some research 
 for this volume we came upon volumes i to v which were published in winnipeg during the years 1933 to 
 1938 these volumes provide some very informative and enjoyable reading and would be of particular interest 0:in 0:terest to anyone 
 who served during that time they are available at the depot for perusal starting with this edition we will discontinue 
 the hyphenated dates of the volume the patrician will be published in march annually to cover the preceding calendar year 
 we think you will find the feature article the all canadian route of 98 by lt nette most interesting ken 
 nette on the slightest provocation can also produce a first class lecture with coloured slides covering the trip the article 
 on the band may well be the last appearing in the patrician the band now belongs to air transport command 
 they continue however to give the regiment first class service it may be noted with interest that the article on 
 the royal green jackets the rifle brigade shows a change in the name of our allied regiment this edition marks 
 the fiftieth anniversary of the death of our first commanding officer lt col f d farquhar dso an article in 
 his memory is included we are particularly grateful to the branches of the association for their contributions 0:contri 0:butions which 
 in all cases include lists of members it is hoped to publish such lists in all future editions the regimental 
 museum located in the leonforte building at the home station is in excellent shape for visiting arrangements see page 23 
 the kit shop is operated with the aim of providing service to members of the regiment and the association we 
 are having some difficulty with suppliers some of whom are now running nearly a year behind in fulfilling orders that 
 is the reason our service is slow on some items a copy of the kit shop price list is included 
 with each copy of this edition literary contributions to the patrician are invited from all members of the regiment and 
 all branches of the association they should be typed and double spaced articles should be addressed to the commanding officer 
 ppcli depot hamilton gault barracks edmonton alberta and should arrive at the depot by 31 january 1967 in closing we 
 wish the best of luck to the second battalion on their impending move to germany and wait to welcome the 
 first battalion to the home station whjs 
 the patrician 6 the alt canadum haute ai 9 93 stage i by lt k a nette owing to the 
 success of adventure training exercises nahanni i and nahanni ii second battalion princess patricia s canadian light infantry decided to 
 attempt to re travel the trail of 98 and a rough plan was drawn up and submitted to canadian forces 
 headquarters for approval the exercise was to be based on the route covered by the prospectors on their journey to 
 the gold fields of the yukon in 1896 gold was discovered 0:dis 0:covered in the klondike creek area of the 
 yukon territory within the next three years an army of would be millionaires arrived to pluck their share from the 
 various creeks and rivers these people came from all over the world most of them arrived by steamer from seattle 
 but several thousand attempted to reach the goldfields by the overland or all canadian 0:cana 0:dian route this hazardous route 
 began at edmonton where the prospectors gathered throughout the winter as soon as the spring thaw had cleared the ice 
 off the rivers usually in early may they freighted their boats and equipment to athabasca landing 90 miles north of 
 edmonton from there they followed the athabasca river as far as lake athabasca crossed the lake and proceeded down the 
 slave river to great slave lake after crossing great slave lake they followed the mackenzie river as far as the 
 mouth of the gravel river now called the keele river they tracked their boats as far as possible up the 
 gravel river and then waited for winter as soon as winter had made travel over the river ice possible they 
 would load their gear on sleds and haul it over the continental divide to the hess river there they would 
 wait for spring breakup and then float on rafts down the hess and stewart rivers as far as mayo landing 
 or dawson normally this trek took approximately eighteen months second battalion party would travel this route in two stages stage 
 i would be a journey by riverboat from athabasca alberta to the mouth of the keele river where gasoline would 
 be cached it was proposed that stage ii would be a winter trip using over snow vehicles of the ski 
 do type this latter phase would start at hay river on great slave lake resupply from the cache of fuel 
 left at the keele river and then proceed west over the continental divide to mayo landing yukon territory i was 
 fortunate to be selected to organize and command stage i of the expedition the plan for stage i called for 
 a party of eight men to travel aboard two large outboard powered riverboats all provisions and equipment with the exception 
 of fuel would be carried with the party fuel was to be resupplied at mcmurray fort smith and fort simpson 
 editor s note accounts of these exercises are given in patrician of 1964 1965 and weekend magazine dec 1965 
 the patrician 7 second battalion possessed one 32 foot riverboat named the hamilton gault this boat had been built by 
 the 1964 adventure training team and was used on exercise nahanni ii as the plan called for two boats another 
 one had to be constructed after much deliberation it was decided to build a boat of the texas dory design 
 this was a 30 foot flat bottom boat with a high bow and a wide downswept stern it was considerably 
 wider than the old boat with about a foot and a half more freeboard construction began in early june under 
 the expert eye of l cpl miller ev of the pioneers and by mid july the first trials were carried 
 out on the north saskatchewan river the boat passed all its tests with flying colours we were to learn later 
 that this design of boat is not suited to fast water although it served us well and was extremely efficient 
 on great slave lake and the wider parts of the mackenzie river the new boat was named admiral ramsay ii 
 in remembrance of the admiral ramsay a 27 footer which had been lost during a river accident on exercise nahanni 
 ii a call for volunteers had been made in may and response had been very good from the many applications 
 i received i chose the following patricias to form my crew sgt wilson ca cpl long raj cpl ritthaler d 
 l cpl macfarlane aa l cpl mcneil rr l cpl peskett raj and pte bray dm by the time the 
 majority of the team arrived back in edmonton from the summer concentration at camp wainwright both boats were shipshape 0:ship 
 0:shape and the bulk of our equipment and provisions had been gathered nevertheless our last week in edmonton was extremely 
 busy and we were all very happy when at 0600 hours on the ist of august we waved good bye 
 to the hamilton gault barracks we arrived at athabasca at 0900 hours and proceeded with launching our boats and stowing 
 our gear as there is very little traffic on the upper athabasca river we were quite an attraction and several 
 of the local inhabitants came down to see us off several of them had colourful tales to tell us of 
 the grand rapids and i couldn t help feeling that they didn t expect us to be able to negotiate 
 this stretch of dangerous water by noon we had all our gear aboard and after a quick lunch we pushed 
 off beginning what were to be seven of the most memorable weeks of our lives i should mention at this 
 time that as well as eight humans the expedition had two canine members skip a german shepherd pup and henrietta 
 a spaniel of undetermined ancestry these two mascots were extremely valuable throughout the trip as their antics kept us all 
 laughing and did a great deal towards keeping our morale at a high level our first problem occurred one and 
 one half hours out of athabasca the motor on the admiral ramsay ii sputtered to a halt refusing to restart 
 only after completely dismantling and cleaning the entire fuel system were we able to continue on downstream owing to this 
 unexpected delay we did not cover a great distance on our first day out we were on our way the 
 next morning and made almost 100 miles that day spending our second night at the mouth of parallel creek eai 
 ly on the morning of our third day out we arrived at pelican portage and spoke to dick newman dick 
 and his family are the only inhabitants of pelican portage he gave us some valuable advice on running the rapids 
 
 the patrician 8 which began around the next bend he advised us to stop and talk to earl kay a 
 trapper who lived further down the river earl had made the trip through the rapids in 1964 with a party 
 from the national geographic society before we left pelican portage dick newman gave us some heads of lettuce from his 
 garden we in turn gave him a box of cookies for his children of whom he seemed to have a 
 bountiful number we found the pelican and stoney rapids to be nothing more than rough water and passed through them 
 without incident arriving at earl kays cabin early that afternoon we found him to be a very interesting person who 
 agreed to come with us as far as the grand rapids he successfully 0:suc 0:cessfully guided us through the rapids 
 dv joli fou and we arrived at the grand rapids early that evening we landed about v o miles above 
 the rapids while half of our party set up camp and prepared supper the remainder of us set out to 
 have a look at the famous rapids what we saw was by no means reassuring the river at this point 
 runs directly north and is divided into two channels by a large island the rapids run along both channels about 
 one half mile long and are completely impassable to river traffic in 1898 a group of enterprising businessmen had established 
 a narrow gauge railway on the island cargos were portaged along this railway and the empty boats were lined down 
 the east channel sometime in the 1930 s during spring breakup the island was completely sheared off by the outgoing 
 ice the railway and all buildings were carried away and as river commerce had ceased with the construction of the 
 northern alberta railway in 1925 they were never replaced the rapids themselves have changed considerably during the past 65 years 
 at one time it was very easy to get onto grand island however since 1898 a rocky point has been 
 built up which stretches for about a mile above the island the river on each side of this point is 
 extremely swift shallow and rocky as the river is bordered with 300 foot cut banks it was impossible to line 
 our boats down the shore we had to get our boats onto grand island and this task became the first 
 step of what was to be a three day operation that evening we ran the hamilton gault down to a 
 point about one half mile above the rapids unfortunately she hit a submerged rock rather hard which caused minor damage 
 this however was just a taste of things to come we spent a very enjoyable evening with our guest earl 
 kay he told us several stories of his adventures on his trip downriver the previous year and some interesting facts 
 about the local wild life the next morning we moved the admiral ramsay ii to the spot where we had 
 left the hamilton gault and the remainder of the day was taken up with getting the two boats onto grand 
 island the next two days found us up to our waists in the water as we lined the two boats 
 down the side of the island both men and boats took a terrible beating as they were bumped against and 
 dragged across the jagged rocks by the swift current after a day and a half we arrived at the end 
 of the island and decided to run through the remaining stretch of rapids which did not appear very rough the 
 plan was for the admiral ramsay ii to go 
 the patrician 9 trail of 98 phase i scale 100 miles to i inch 100 50 0 100 200 
 the patrician 10 through first and if successful the hamilton gault would follow we realized our mistake as soon as 
 we hit the main current the water was very rough and so muddy that we couldn t see submerged rocks 
 until we were almost on top of them the boat hit three submerged rocks without causing any serious damage and 
 then with a sickening crunch it grounded on a large rock which had about three inches of water flowing over 
 it the crew of the hamilton gault who had been watching us through binoculars later told us that it looked 
 like the boat was going to stand up on its stern and flip over backwards the boat sat on the 
 rock for about four or five seconds at the time it seemed like a minute or more and then slid 
 off almost going under the boat was badly damaged and half full of water fortunately none of our gear was 
 damaged and as no one had been hurt we chalked the whole thing up to experience that night we managed 
 to move the hamilton gault from the island to the main river bank and we spent the next morning lining 
 it through the remaining rough water both boats had taken a terrible beating and required repairs we decided not to 
 stay at the grand rapids but to move on to buffalo creek about 20 miles downstream we went through the 
 little grand rapids without incident but discovered soon after that the skeg had broken off the motor on the admiral 
 ramsay ii the motor was not functioning properly and the boat was taking a great deal of water needless to 
 say we were a pretty sorry looking crew when we limped ashore at buffalo creek to lick our wounds three 
 days were spent at buffalo creek while we hauled our boats up on shore turned them over let them dry 
 out and repaired them we splinted the split frameworks and put fiber glass patches on all the holes we also 
 carried out maintenance on the motors and on departure from buffalo creek on the 10th of august they were both 
 running better than ever we ran through the brule rapids without any problems and spent the night at the algar 
 river the 11th of august was one of the most exciting days of our trip we left the algar river 
 early that morning and arrived in mcmurray at around 1600 hours during that interval we ran through nine sets of 
 rapids the first we encountered were the boiler rapids these rapids are so named because the scow carrying the boiler 
 for the first hudson s bay company steamboat to be built in northern canada was swamped there and the boiler 
 was lost as far as i have been able to find out this boiler has never been recovered and is 
 still somewhere in the athabasca river these rapids are very rough with extremely high swells but apart from a few 
 tense moments we had no trouble running through them the middle rapids long rapids and crooked rapids also gave us 
 little trouble as by this time we were becoming quite experienced river rats the remaining 0:re 0:maining rapids on the 
 athabasca river the rock rapids little cascade rapids cascade rapids mountain rapids and rainbow cascade are all a series of 
 cascades these are rock ledges stretching from bank to bank with drops of from one to five feet the current 
 is very swift and once you commit yourself to a course there is no turning back they are very difficult 
 to see from upstream first appearing as a thin white line stretching 0:stretch 0:ing the width of the river you 
 cannot see how deep the drop is until you 
 the patrician 11 are about 10 feet above it at this point it is too late to change your mind 
 we jumped the boats over the ledges by floating to about 20 feet above the drop with just enough power 
 on to maintain steerage putting on full power for about two seconds and then pulling the motor out of the 
 water dropping it back in as soon as the stern had cleared the ledge both boats took some water over 
 the bow and the sterns took a savage beating on the rock ledges although this was all very exciting and 
 adventurous we were all very relieved to have the last cascade in our wake by this time i was half 
 expecting to find my fingerprints permanently impressed into the side of the boat while somewhat terrifying these cascades have a 
 beauty all of their own some of them look just like a miniature niagara falls and i consider myself lucky 
 to have had the chance to see them the country bordering the river in this area is also very beautiful 
 because of the obstacles presented by the grand rapids and the cascades this country is almost untouched by human hands 
 there is a bountiful supply of game at one point we saw a bear on one side of the river 
 and a deer on the opposite bank the country appeared very peaceful and although only 300 miles from edmonton it 
 was the most isolated area that we travelled through lining the hamilton gault through the grand rapids l to r

 the patrician 12 when we reached mcmurray old holes in the boat had re opened and new ones had developed 
 again we had to haul the boats up on shore and repair them our supply of fiberglass resin was almost 
 exhausted by this time and we were unable to get any at mcmurray because of this we were not able 
 to repair the boats as efficiently as we would have liked and the hamilton gault was still leaking badly when 
 we left mcmurray after a few days the natural swelling of the wood brought the leak down to a mere 
 trickle nevertheless l cpl macfarlane developed a very efficient 0:ef 0:ficient bailing arm over the next five weeks we left 
 mcmurray on the 13th the country north of mcmurray is very different from that south of it the river more 
 than doubles its width and the current is so slow that at some points it does not appear to be 
 moving at all the country on either side of the river is very flat and marshy because there is a 
 great deal of commercial shipping on the river all the channels are well marked and as l cpl peskett put 
 it it was just like driving down a highway about 20 miles from lake athabasca the river splits into several 
 small channels near the mouth of the channel we followed we came upon a dredging barge this barge had been 
 working on the channel into the lake but as it was sunday the crew had taken the day off they 
 were very hospitable and as they seldom had visitors they were very glad to see us we had a very 
 pleasant visit with them during which they radioed fort chipewyan and got us a weather forecast as the forecast was 
 favourable we waved goodbye to our new found friends and proceeded across the lake arriving at fort chipewyan at about 
 1600 hours fort chipewyan is a large settlement populated mostly by indians we spent half an hour sightseeing and then 
 pushed off down the riviere des rochers the country was very rocky and the mosquitoes unbearable we were all very 
 glad that we had brought mosquito nets along the next day we arrived at the junction of the riviere des 
 rochers and the peace river these two large rivers coming together form the slave river the slave is a very 
 slow wide river which is one of the main tributaries of the great slave lake in some places the river 
 is almost two miles wide as the channel was well marked all we had to do was sit back and 
 enjoy the view we arrived at fitzgerald late in the afternoon of the 16th from fitzgerald to fort smith there 
 are 16 miles of extremely dangerous rapids in 1898 the prospectors had a choice between making several back breaking portages 
 or having their boats freighted around by oxen we had made previous arrangements to have our boats portaged by northern 
 transportation 0:transporta 0:tion company they were very busy however when we arrived and it was august 18th before they were 
 able to accommodate us the 17th was spent on the dog river a small tributary of the slave it is 
 interesting to note that alexander mackenzie also camped on the dog river before making his portage of the rapids about 
 a mile up the dog we found a very beautiful natural camp site there was a small waterfall with several 
 large deep pools the fishing was excellent and we all had a chance to do our laundry and get our 
 gear in order it was a warm sunny day and although the water was very cold some of us went 
 swimming 
 the patrician 13 the next morning we reported to the wharf at fitzgerald our boats were plucked from the water 
 by a mobile crane known as a cherry picker loaded on trucks and dropped back into the water at bell 
 rock the northern transportation company bell rock camp is nine miles north of fort smith they were very kind to 
 us there allowing us to stay in their quarters and eat in their mess hall the area around bell rock 
 is a museum of a past era everywhere you look you see old boat hulls old wooden barges and bits 
 of machinery from the hudson s bay company steamboats everyone enjoyed our stay and despite the weather being miserable the 
 next day everybody was in good spirits as we refuelled and pushed off downstream on the 20th we had our 
 first look at great slave lake we were all impressed with this huge body of water but we were to 
 learn to hate it during the next few days the water was very choppy but with the wind behind us 
 we made good headway as we proceeded west we spent 15 minutes at fort resolution a small bleak looking settlement 
 and then pushed off to the little buffalo river where we camped for the night after leaving the little buffalo 
 river the next morning we proceeded west following the shoreline the southern shore of great slave lake is very shallow 
 and rocky as a result we had to travel over a mile out from shore in order to keep from 
 running aground there was a strong northwest wind blowing and the lake soon became quite rough the situation 0:situ 0:ation 
 worsened to the point where the hamilton gault was shipping water over the side and we were forced to run 
 for cover we were lucky enough to find a place where we could safely bring the boats to shore we 
 then prepared to sit out the weather by noon it was obvious that the above left 2nd battalion adventure training

 the patrician 14 weather was not going to get any better that day so we moved the boats to the 
 leeward side of a small island and set up camp for the night the weather got steadily worse all day 
 and it was noon the next day before we could safely venture out on the lake again the lake was 
 still very rough but the wind had shifted so that it was directly behind us the swells were about four 
 feet high and 20 feet apart both boats especially the hamilton gault threw up a considerable amount of spray and 
 to make matters worse a drizzling rain began falling at about 1600 hours we were a very wet and miserable 
 crew who rode the surf into hay river that night we spent the night at a partially completed tourist camp 
 ground and with a hot meal in our stomachs and a roof over our heads our spirits rose considerably the 
 next morning we were dismayed to find that during the night the heavy surf had washed our boats up onto 
 the beach both boats were high and dry by digging tugging and pushing we were able to get them afloat 
 and by 1000 hours we were again at sea although the wind had dropped considerably it had again changed direction 
 0:direc 0:tion so that we were heading directly into it we were forced to travel at a very slow speed 
 and run a zig zag course we made very slow progress 0:pro 0:gress and used up a great deal more 
 fuel than we had anticipated we arrived at wrigley harbour at around 1600 hours that afternoon wrigley harbour is a 
 sheltered bay which forms the end of great slave lake and the beginning of the mackenzie river we spent the 
 night on a small island and pushed off the next morning glad to be back on a river once again 
 we found the mackenzie to be a very clear fast flowing river with an average width of about two miles 
 in two places it widens out to form lakes beaver lake the first of these lakes begins about 10 miles 
 past wrigley harbour it is about 20 miles long and 5 miles wide as the weather was good we had 
 little trouble crossing it that afternoon we arrived at fort providence here we made a careful check of our fuel 
 supply and discovered that owing to our large consumption on great slave lake we did not have enough left to 
 take us to fort simpson which was our next refuelling point fortunately there was an army survey team working in 
 fort providence and through them we were able to purchase the extra gasoline we needed we pushed on and spent 
 that night and the next day at the mouth of the horn river a tributary of the mackenzie here all 
 had a good rest and a chance to get our gear in order the next morning we crossed mills lake 
 the second lake on the mackenzie river this lake is about 15 miles long and 10 miles wide as there 
 was a stiff wind blowing the lake was quite rough and we were all very glad when the river narrowed 
 to its normal width the current was very strong and we made good time arriving in fort simpson on the 
 28th of august despite arriving late we were able to refuel that night and moved on the next morning although 
 our boats were considerably overloaded they were carrying over 750 gallons of gasoline we made good headway on our second 
 day out of fort simpson we learned how treacherous the mackenzie river can be and almost met with disaster a 
 sudden blow came up and the water became quite rough both boats ran for shelter behind a large sandbar covered 
 with willows after about half an hour 
 the patrician 15 the wind died down and as the sandbar was a very poor camp site and an even 
 worse harbour for the boats we decided to push on we had just gotten into midstream when the wind came 
 up again considerably worse than it had been before the waves were about three feet high and two feet apart 
 and as the wind was blowing against the current a curious curling effect was produced the admiral ramsay ii was 
 in the lead and we immediately decided to turn and head for shore the hamilton gault was already heading for 
 shore at this time we got turned around safely and were heading for shore when a large wave broke over 
 our stern drowning out the motor private bray immediately jumped up on the point of the bow and his weight 
 counter acted the weight of the water we had taken in over the stern it is possible that his prompt 
 action is what saved us if the stern had gone completely under our overloaded boat would certainly have swamped by 
 paddling we were able to get the boat pointed in the right direction so that the waves were not hitting 
 us broadside the crew of the hamilton gault seeing that we were in trouble changed their course and came out 
 to help us they made a pass in front of us and we threw them our bow rope they were 
 unable to hold on to it however and had to let it go they attempted to make another pass at 
 us but as we had the situation under control and they themselves were in danger we waved them off they 
 immediately headed for shore about 40 feet from shore a large wave broke over their side and the boat began 
 filling up with water again quick action saved the day they threw everything that would float overboard and by lightening 
 their load were able to stay afloat until they reached shore where the boat settled on the bottom in about 
 two feet of water by this time we had succeeded in paddling the admiral ramsay ii to shore and we 
 assisted them in recovering 0:re 0:covering the items they had jettisoned luckily we did not lose any thing and nothing 
 was badly damaged as heavy waves were breaking over the sunken boat it would have been useless to attempt raising 
 it until the weather was calmer we set up camp and spent the night at this spot the next morning 
 the river was as smooth as glass and in a surprisingly short time we had the hamilton gault bailed out 
 and afloat we reloaded the boat and were ready to move on by noon unscarred but somewhat wiser men for 
 our experience we arrived at wrigley the following day wrigley is a very small settlement consisting of a hudson s 
 bay company store a church a school and about 25 small cabins we cached two drums of fuel here for 
 use on our return trip about 10 minutes after leaving wrigley the wind came up again and after our experience 
 of two days before we decided to put in to shore and wait for calmer weather the river remained rough 
 all that day at 0600 hours the next morning we pushed off and made 20 miles before the river again 
 became too rough for travel we were able to move on at 1700 hours and we travelled until last light 
 the weather was extremely cold and the north wind made it very miserable in our open boats the river was 
 calm the next morning and we got an early start there 
 the patrician 16 was a cold drizzling rain falling which soon turned to wet snow that morning was the most 
 miserable four hours of the whole trip by noon however the skies had cleared and although it did not appear 
 to get any warmer the sun put us all in a more cheerful mood our goal the mouth of the 
 keele river was reached early that afternoon 0:after 0:noon after caching the drums of gasoline to be used by stage 
 ii of the expedition we set up camp and spent the next day there on the sth of september we 
 started our return journey upriver and arrived back at wrigley on the 7th we picked up our cache of fuel 
 and pushed on to old fort island a spot we had camped at during our trip down river we arrived 
 back at fort simpson on september the 11th and refuelled i telephoned edmonton arranging to have transport waiting for us 
 when we arrived at hay river our trip from fort simpson to wrigley harbour was uneventful however our old enemy 
 great slave lake was waiting for us although it is less than 35 miles from wrigley harbour to hay river 
 it took us over a day to make it we left wrigley harbour on the 16th and were forced ashore 
 by rough water an hour later darkness found us on a small island about 15 miles from hay river the 
 next morning we pushed off as soon as it was light enough to see the horizon and we arrived at 
 hay river at 0700 hours our trucks were there to meet us and we lost no time in loading our 
 boats and gear by 1100 hours we were heading south on the mackenzie flighway after an uneventful road trip we 
 arrived in edmonton late in the afternoon of september the 18th we had spent exactly seven weeks on our journey 
 stage i of exercise trail of 98 was a crowning success as well as planting the cache of fuel for 
 phase 11 we met several interesting people and learned a great deal about the canadian north i feel that my 
 story would not be complete without adding a word of praise for the men i had with me they all 
 worked very hard and regardless 0:regard 0:less of how bad the situation appeared someone could find something humorous in it 
 morale was always at an extremely high level partly due to the efforts of our cook l cpl macfarlane although 
 we encountered several obstacles that were not anticipated conquering them was all part of the game these made the trip 
 all the more exciting and memorable i assure anyone who is interested in doing a trip of this type that

 the patrician 25 regimental band a bandsman s lot is not an appy one so might one paraphrase gilbert and 
 sullivan whose father incidentally was one of the original professors at kneller hall the royal military school of music from 
 whence all patricia bandmasters have graduated but if not happy certainly varied 1965 followed its normal pattern for the band 
 though three engagements 0:engage 0:ments all on alien soil deserve mention in february we flew by boxcar to regina where 
 we played governor general vanier in at 27 we had to crowd into the terminal building with the guard of 
 honour and so could only play the royal salute this on friday then a long wait at rcaf moose jaw 
 in a blizzard until monday when at 1000 hrs sitting in a bus with a frozen fuel line between moose 
 jaw and regina we watched his excellency s plane fly overhead over a thousand miles to play six bars of 
 salute again in saskatchewan this time in august to play for the sunset ceremonies held thrice weekly in regina coupled 
 with various diamond jubilee celebrations we were dispatched from regina to prince albert to play for the lt governor of 
 saskatchewan we played his royal salute and then being eaten alive by mosquitoes stood smartly at the ready waiting 0:wait 
 0:ing for the end of his speech and 0 canada however he stopped talking 0:talk 0:ing and walked off abruptly 
 completely unaware of our presence this time over 700 miles by bus for a six bar salute lastly in saskatoon 
 now in october we participated in the opening of the saskatchewan potash show here we played various receptions and a 
 provincial banquet for the more than 1000 international delegates and also were committed to play in the industrial exhibition where 
 we were given an exhibition stand 9 x 35 for 40 men plus stands and fronted by a busy aisle 
 truly stimulating conditions in marked contrast to these engagements all carried out away from home were the many functions we 
 carried out with the regiment the trooping retreats dinners and dances which are a normal part of regimental 0:regi 0:mental 
 life all found their place in our time table and the band s efforts were well received a new venture 
 in the band s travels was also well received in 1965 for the first time in several years the band 
 played extensively in the schools of the province playing an entertaining but definitely educational programme we played to over 40 
 schools and a total audience of over 10 000 children in these as in all our concerts the name of 
 the princess patricia s was brought prominently to the fore and the enthusiastic reception 0:re 0:ception the band received both 
 for its musicianly performances and also for the conduct and bearing of the individual members often under excessively 0:ex 0:cessively 
 trying conditions never failed to gladden the hearts of all who care for the good name of the regiment the 
 band played over 200 engagements 0:en 0:gagements in the year covering all of alberta and most of saskatchewan in keeping 
 with its role as the army s public relations medium one cannot 0:can 0:not help feeling that it will be 
 a tragedy if the distinctive full dress uniform and the proud name are allowed to lapse with amalgamation what could 
 take the place of has anyone seen the colonel to finish a programme in truth a bandsman s lot is 
 not an appy one but all we need to make it happy is an audience now and a future to 
 look forward to

 1964 after the hectic hustle and bustle of the jubilee year it is a welcome respite 
 the patrician 35 social activity in the mess has continued in the normal swinging fashion with plenty of entertainment provided 
 by the committees concerned several bingos were held throughout the year with many excellent hummel figurine prizes available the mess 
 hockey team proved quite active during the season and many enjoyable social evenings were spent between here and the bde 
 sgts mess the year has been perhaps marred slightly by the many members departing 0:de 0:parting on various postings and 
 retirement we were saddened by the departure of rsm mrs aj rudd for canada a farewell dinner was held in 
 his honor and also for lt col brown who left for canada about the same time we were also sorry

 to an end with a flurry of assorted activities including 0:includ 0:ing the annual mess christmas draw the men s 
 christmas dinner an at home to the gentlemen of the officers mess the general consensus seems to be that this 
 tried and true tradition has ground to an exceedingly slow pace in the past few years surely age cannot be 
 the factor a cocktail party was held in the mess on the 26th with all members and their ladies proceeding 
 to the rhf mess afterwards a most cordial welcome was extended 0:ex 0:tended by their members and an enjoyable dance 
 and buffet followed the old year went out and the new came in with an exceptionally successful ball held in 
 the unit gym the members true to form looked forward with an eager alert and clear mind to the levee 
 the following morning with that we bid farewell to 1965 and look ahead to 1966 we wish all the best 
 to our old and new friends alike and only hope that with time our association will deepen corporals mess now 
 that ist battalion is well ensconced in the green hills of the sauerland the corporals mess is a going concern 
 the year 1965 was ushered in with a new year s ball perhaps one reason for the inclemency of the 
 weather since could be attributed to the manner in which the new year was greeted a very successful function of 
 the mess has been the weekly bingo nights this addiction is nourished week by week as the pots increase on 
 march 17th the regiment celebrated lady patricia s birthday the corporals mess concluded birthday celebrations with a ball held in 
 
 the patrician 36 the west wing of the men s mess the officers mess is still trying to justify paying 
 more for a four piece band than the corporals mess paid for a ten piece band on the ist of 
 may a rather strange dance was held as part of the 50th anniversary of the battle of frezenberg celebrations while 
 the greatest attendance for the year was recorded the same cannot be said of the band it proved to be 
 non existent the new pmc was elected on the grounds that he must always sing louder than the outgoing president 
 should a similar situation occur one highlight of 1965 was the come as you are found dance held in may 
 a committee visited all members of the mess at their homes during an inauspicious hour the resulting attire discovered by 
 the committee 0:com 0:mittee members was noted and recorded on the night of the dance all discrepancies in dress resulted 
 in dire punishment for the offender the dance was a great success and typifies life at the corporals mess the 
 4 cibg corporals mess sports league is very active and the calibre 0:cali 0:bre of play steadily improves the corporals 
 mess participated with vim and vigour in the hockey and softball leagues and reached the finals in both the 1965 
 66 hockey league is in full swing as the patrician goes to press the mess has already given warning that 
 it does not intend to be a runner up the foul weather and high winds which have characterized 1965 have 
 had their effect on the corporals mess all agree that it is rather difficult to receive the dutch tv station 
 when the mess antenna lies mangled on the soggy turf as 1966 dawns the members hope for a return of 
 good weather and look ahead to that time of confusion termed rotation nijmegen marches ist battalion team steps out commanded

 the patrician 37 men s canteen the patricia arms like the famous windmill has had another year of uninterrupted service 
 only one soldier was denied its privileges for misbehaviour the canteen had a credit balance in each of its monthly 
 statements one of the highlights of the year was a four day trip to paris which was organized by our 
 lady in green miss joan barter wvs she was also busy conducting games evenings with other units in the area 
 we seem to have been able to take the prizes in most of the dart tournaments stag parties were enjoyed 
 by the single men on the 17th of march and at new year s 65 while the married men and 
 their wives were hosted by the corporals mess for these functions improvements to the canteen during the year have been 
 steady with additional dart boards placed in the wet bar and a new ping pong table for the wvs lounge 
 the new year expects to see the installation of new cafeteria facilities also included in the something new department is 
 the sale of liquor the final year of ist battalion in germany is expected to be one of continued enjoyment 
 of the facilities in the newly renovated canteen until rotation time and handover to our sister battalion in the fall 
 sports in 1965 the ist battalion was extremely active in sports and as the trophy case clearly displays the results 
 were fruitful numerous records were broken and higher standards established owing to the tremendous efforts by our athletes patricias participating 
 in their respective sports demonstrated the highest traditions of teamwork and spirit found in our regiment it is with regret 
 that we bid farewell to s sgt gammon the head of our pt staff who has been posted to the 
 aspt camp borden staff gammon was a member of the regiment until recently when he transferred to the aptc the 
 majority of patricias will remember the hard workouts under him and will attempt to keep up the high standard on 
 which he insisted we wish him the best in his new endeavours the number of firsts which the battalion mustered 
 in 1965 were many our representative teams successfully defeated other units to place first in the following brigade competitions track 
 and field soccer swimming 0:swim 0:ming judo bowling and golf the track and field team had an exceptionally good year 
 and at the brigade meet l cpl c petit broke his own brigade record and set a new brigade and 
 army record by putting the shot 94 feet 3 inches l cpl petit is also the british army heavyweight boxing 
 champion the 4 x 100 metres relay team with a time of 44 8 seconds just missed the army record 
 of 44 7 in the final analysis the patricias had totalled a score of 1731 2 points with the nearest 
 opponents some 17 points back the ist battalion soccer team had a tremendous season mainly due to the untiring efforts 
 of sgt george payne who displayed a great deal of soccer knowledge and patience in guiding the team to the 
 brigade and canadian forces european zone championships it was not an easy 
 the patrician 38 season for the team but because of excellent teamwork they were able to complete their second undefeated 
 season in brigade play this fall we have put ourselves out on a limb and challenged the natives at their 
 own sport by joining the 2 br div soccer league the competition has stiffened up considerably somehow we wish there 
 were some british hockey teams which could be included in our brigade league the swimming team started from scratch this 
 year as we had not participated in this sport to any extent in the past years under the guidance of 
 lt tb winfield the team conquered its growing pains and placed first in the brigade competition highlights included cpl clare 
 s record in the 50 metre butterfly and the new records set in the 4 x 50 metres medley relay 
 and the 4 xso metres free style event another team which has made great progress in the past year is 
 the battalion judo team the two individuals responsible for the training and conditioning of the team are cpl keddie and 
 l cpl perry neither had previous experience in judo prior to our arrival in germany yet both now have brown 
 belts and have produced a winning team in succession ist battalion won the brigade army of the rhine and british 
 army championships this is an example of teamwork and spirit on the part of all members of the judo club 
 capt pe vik receives the currie trophy from brig aj tedlie first battalion went on to place 3rd in the

 the patrician 39 moving on to the smaller scale sports bowling and golf come to light although the number of 
 team members was considerably smaller the enthusiasm and effort put forth were no less than those displayed in the major 
 sports both teams won their respective championships in the brigade hockey is always a hot topic for discussion from many 
 points of view particularly as our 2 ic major ga gunton releases ever increasing funds for equipment for the team 
 at any rate wo 2 f dodd certainly put forth a diligent effort in coaching our team to the brigade 
 semi finals it would appear however that our fast but light team is not quite a match for some of 
 the heavier service corps players from fort chambly maybe we should devote some of our practise time to eating the 
 team fared well by placing two players cpl kemp and pte wark on the high scoring column in the league 
 statistics the fastball team reached the brigade semi finals despite having to practise in the rain and mist unfortunately the 
 weather had a lot to do with interrupting the league play we are certain that this team will do much 
 better next season the spring of 1965 saw the finals of the basketball and volleyball leagues the basketball team lost 
 to the fort garry horse in the semifinals 0:semi 0:finals and the volleyball team fought to a second place in 
 the brigade finals in basketball capt jw furlong topped the brigade scoring ladder with pte dr pickerl not far behind 
 inter company sports for the season 1964 65 were dominated by support company due no doubt to the large number 
 of available players 1 ppcli judo team 4 cibg baor and british army champions 
 the patrician 40 the football french grey cup volleyball and soccer championships were taken by support dashing delta company succeeded 
 in capturing the basketball championship the texas bar trophy went of course to support company for the greatest number of 
 points attained in inter company 0:inter 0:com 0:pany sports under the new organization the inter company competitions should be less 
 one sided the fall season is now in full swing judging by the schedule it will have more emphasis on 
 inter company competition the various unit representative teams are beginning to shape up well already the hockey rink reverberates to 
 the clash of hockey sticks and crashing bodies while the gymnasium echoes to the thumps of volleyballs and basketballs when 
 we as professional soldiers look upon the increasing emphasis on sports in the army we see a continual striving for 
 teamwork team spirit physical fitness and competition this is in keeping with the best traditions of the army and the 
 regiment and although we may not realize it as we play the sports are in fact making better soldiers and 
 citizens of the future the real value of sport is not the actual game played in the limelight of applause 
 but the hours of dogged determination and self discipline carried out alone imposed and supervised by an exacting conscience the 
 applause soon dies away the prize is left behind but the character you build up is yours forever brig aj

 the future each departing member throughout the year was presented with an engraved teaspoon they are too numerous to mention

 was the birth in june of the one hundredth baby since our arrival the honours for this go to mrs 
 vatter she was presented with a suitably engraved infants silver mug a bus load of our members spent a very 
 enjoyable day in cologne on numerous occasions it was felt the driver should have been furnished with a street guide

 the patrician 56 soccer for the second successive year the battalion soccer team did not play in an organized league 
 however the team did compete in two army tournaments finishing second in both this proves that a good team lies 
 dormant within the battalion during the wainwright summer concentration the team participated in a brigade knock out tournament being defeated 
 finally by the sherwood 0:sher 0:wood foresters 1 to 0 in late september the battalion entered the soccer team in 
 the annual pearkes zone play offs there were only three teams entered rcaf namao rcaf cold lake and 2nd battalion 
 the first game with cold lake ended in a 6 to 0 victory for 2nd battalion because of four spectacular 
 goals by pte heinrich a 4 to 1 victory for namao over cold lake set the stage for an exciting 
 final after two periods of sudden death overtime the battalion went down in defeat 3 2 to rcaf station namao 
 we look forward to better things on arrival in germany and hope to build a strong contender there there is 
 no doubt that the battalion will be missed on the alberta soccer scene over the past ten years we have

 were settled in balai ringin camp on the only road of any consequence in sarawak itself only seven miles from 
 the border with only two forward bases c coy hq had no tactical role and much to the sorrow of 
 major stevens cave had been disbanded major cave himself toek over command of hq coy from major mike carleton when 
 he left n september for pre staff college courses and commanded the hq bass each base had a 105 mm 
 gun of 79 cdo bty ra and the coy 81 mm mortars rifle platoons were switched between bases by helicopters 
 as the tactic situation demanded by now rifle platoons had completed their familiarization period tl e border area including the 
 border ridge itself which was in many plac s precipitous 2 000 feet high jungle covered and narrow thus confinii 
 g movement to the slippery track along the border itself was well knovn to all platoons the art of cutting 
 helicopter landing pads along the border so that reserve platoons could be flown in to cut off any enemy incursions 
 was well understood and practised the process of winning the hear s and minds of the local inhabitants by frequent 
 visits to kampongs in bo h forward and rear areas doctoring their sick and winning their confiden e by our 
 presence was well under way with increasing confidence amoi g the villagers information about the enemy was beginning to flow 
 met freely but the enemy was little in evidence soon it became clear that the aggressive and reasonably efficient enemy 
 unit which had made four major incursions of company strength or above into the area during the previous three months 
 and had nearly taken out a forward base of o n predecessors 2nd bn the parachute regiment had been withdrawn 
 platoon after platoon came back from 5 8 day patrols of the border area tired but unblooded and having seen 
 no trace of the enemy on two oc casions cut off operations using two to four platoons flown in by 
 helicopt sr were mounted to deal with reported incursions on one of these a sm ll enemy party frightened by 
 routine harassing gun fire withdrew hslf an hour before the stops arrived in position the other proved a fal e 
 alarm a border scout with a nightmare our first contact when the leading scout of a patrolling platoon had a 
 fleeting shot at four fleeii g 
 the patrician 71 enemy on a steep jungle covered hill in a thunderstorm was unsuccessful he missed and was missed 
 in return with experience our own scale of operations increased until we were inounting company patrol and ambush operations in 
 the border area of up bo seven platoons in strength and lasting up to eight days at last in arly 
 october came success a small force acting on a lead and consisting if 7 pi alastair stewart and the recce 
 pi sgt cameron under captain mike scrase dickins surprised just after dawn an enemy force of about platoon strength bivouacing 
 in the border area and drove them back under lover of 105 mm gun fire over the border killing eight 
 and wounding five ye had no losses ourselves this was a remarkably successful little operation 0:oper 0:ation reflecting great credit 
 on all concerned and well deserved after months of intense but unrewarding operations during the remainder of our tour in 
 sarawak operations continued at high pressure but without further physical contact we continued to fflominate the forward area by intense 
 patrolling and ambush operations sometimes under intermittent and inaccurate mortar fire from the enemy bide of the border but no 
 further enemy penetration took place in december however a new threat appeared rfn masterman of b coy returning eighth in 
 line along the border ridge from a company operation stepped on an enemy laid plastic anti personnel mine he was 
 evacuated fflirect to kuching hospital from a hastily cut helicopter winching pad and escaped with the loss of one leg 
 below the knee he had however by she time he reached hospital lost a lot of blood and it was 
 a close run thing again just before christmas we had another mining incident 7 pi alastair stewart sent to prove 
 a helicopter landing pad on the border in an area which had not been visited for sometime so that major 
 f avid ramsbotham and the company commander of the relieving cornmany 0:corn 0:many of the ist bn durham light infantry 
 could fly in to join them found he pad mined the helicopter was hastily waved away and the platoon located 
 and cleared with considerable caution a total of eight mines in the area of the pad fortunately in the final 
 sweep which was then mounted to leave the border area clean no further mines were found meanwhile in the rear 
 areas we were extending our range of patrolling to cover kampongs in places particularly near the sea never before visited 
 y british troops we did this mainly by longboats with outboard motors frsing the rivers this was very interesting work 
 making a good break rom border operations and platoons rapidly improved their boat handling skills apart from these patrols the 
 only break the men had during the hole six months was one four day stay at pri expense in a 
 chinese hotel in kuching this was a highly popular period of rest and recuperation and many intriguing stories are still 
 current and so on 2nd january 1966 the time came to hand over our responsibilities 0:respon 0:sibilities in sarawak to 
 the ist bn the durham light infantry and after i short stay in nee soon transit camp singapore to return 
 to england for five or six weeks leave our time in sarawak had been ixtremely testing and occasionally exciting the 
 climate the appalling going the intensity and long jungle operations put a strain on even the roughest of men the 
 cheerfulness and professional efficiency of the rifle platoons on who inevitably the major burden fell and the loyalty effort and 
 tremendous sense of purpose shown by those in less glamourous roles

 and presented by brigadier a hamilton gault there are still some things in connection to this trophy that are a 
 mystery initially how this project wound up at the rcs of i and not as a regimental project secondly why 
 i was selected for the model maybe brigadier gault directed that a patricia would be the model or maybe it 
 was the wise judgement of the school commandant colonel pr bingham before the trophy could be made a design had 
 to be chosen this is where i the model came in major friel informed me that i would have to 
 pose for a photographer and the position would be the prone and would be photographed from all angles the photographs 
 would then be sent to brigadier gault who would decide which one he wanted to use the photograph selected would 
 be used by the sculptors as they worked on the trophy there was some humour as well as trials and

 be the expert and ensure i was in the correct position before the camera was allowed to click i dressed 
 as ordered and went to the studio at the specified time after waiting for over an hour the photographer finally 
 appeared now for the trials and tribulations the photographer a mr brown had car trouble to the tune of approximately 
 15 00 and this financial set back affected the hamilton gault trophy mr brown lived as you might say from 
 hand to mouth and the money he spent on his car was meant to buy the film for the project 
 so he informed us that the work in this session could not be completed because of the lack of film 
 during session two mr brown who by this time had come by some money and was able to purchase the 
 film needed took an overhead photo this was done by brown crawling through the attic trap door and get 75

 the patrician 77 ting himself into position s sgt white placed me directly below the trap door and got me 
 into the correct firing position in order for the photo to be taken other than mr brown emerging from the 
 attic covered with dust and dirt session two was uneventful there are some things which i thought were humorous that 
 resulted in a third session with photographer brown after session two mr brown presented his work to the commandant tfor 
 his perusal prior to despatching it to brigadier gault colonel bingpam 0:bing 0:pam found several things wrong with my turn 
 out and the pictures in general in one of the pictures you could see the soles of my boots and 
 pne of the hob nails was missing of course this would never do in several others my left hand with 
 a wrist watch and ring showed and phis was definitely out my assistant s sgt white had forgotten about the 
 background scenery and a large overloaded garbage basket appeared en several of the proofs as a result of all of 
 this a third session was arranged and conducted without incident mr brown submitted his finished product once more this time 
 it made the grade in april 1957 i received a personal letter from brigadier gault written in his own hand 
 and he thanked me for the part i played in his trophy and informed me that i would be going 
 down to posterity at the hands of garrards the silversmiths he also told me that on his next visit to 
 the battalion i was to ensure that i approach him so he could thank me personally unfortunately the latter never 
 came about as he passed on even before he could present his trophy for competition baseball hockey equipment archery equipment

 rsm wol james gordon austin mc cd left the ppcli depot and hamilton gault barracks for his new posting as 
 garrison sergeant major at halifax he had been with the ppcli depot as rsm since 1 sep 61 where he 
 was held in awe by recruits and staff and respected by all his modus operandi may not have always been 
 by the book but he got things done the museum and the depot barracks were a joy to behold and 
 his memory of all things regimental was outstanding wol austin commenced his army career as a private in sep 39 
 with the royal canadian regiment attaining the rank of sergeant after a brief tour with the canadian training school he 
 was posted to the royal winnipeg rifles promoted to wol and saw service with that battalion in north west europe 
 he was awarded the military cross for his leadership and coolness under fire and for the inspiring example he set 
 to both officers and men of his battalion he returned to canada via 8 canadian repatriation depot and took his 
 release in sep 45 wol austin soon realized that civilian life was not for him and jan 47 saw him 
 back in uniform as a sergeant in the rcr he shared the period may 47 to may 52 between the 
 joint air training centre at rivers and the officer can

 office one day and a young lady answered and wol austin asked her what she was giving him for christmas 
 without a second s hesitation the young lady said a baby austin to which wol austin had no reply known 
 affectionately as mick the stick because of his erect and soldierly posture rsm austin was a shining example to many 
 young sergeants a new breed of rsms has taken over the efficiency remains but the waxed moustache the imperious air

 the patrician 81 lt col francis douglas farquhar dso coldstream guards first commanding officer princess patricia s canadian light infantry 
 cmmrwm colonel farquhar was born on the 17th of september 1874 the son of sir henry t farquhar baronet he 
 joined the coldstream guards on the 29th of april 1896 and became lieutenant on the 24th of january 1898 pie 
 served in the south african war was mentioned in despatches received the queen s medal with 5 clasps and was 
 awarded the dso on the 27th of september 1901 he served with the chinese royal infantry from 1901 to 1902 
 the somaliland field force from 1903 to 1904 and on the general staff the war office from 1908 to 1913 
 colonel farquhar married lady evelyn plealy hutchison the sister of the 6th earl of donoughmore he was appointed military secretary 
 to the governor general of canada hrh the duke of connaught and was promoted lieutenant colonel on the 6th of 
 october 1913 a position he occupied at the outbreak 0:out 0:break of war in august 1914 on the 12th of 
 august 1914 colonel farquhar was appointed 0:ap 0:pointed to command ppcli he commanded during mobilization 0:mobiliza 0:tion training and in 
 the operations in france january march 1915 he was twice mentioned in despatches and died of wounds on the 20th 
 of march 1915 
 the patrician 82 lt col francis douglas farquhar dso first commanding officer princess patricia s canadian light infantry this year 
 of publication marks the 50th anniversary oj the death of our first commanding 0:command 0:ing officer the following article was 
 submitted by mr rg barclay secretary treasurer of the toronto branch ppcli association it was no light task that faced 
 francis farquhar hamilton gault his second in command and herbert buller his adjutant in those hot august days at lansdowne 
 park in ottawa over a thousand men from every corner of canada and every walk of life had joined the 
 newlyformed 0:newly 0:formed regiment all but a scant fifty had seen military service and 456 of them wore the ribbons 
 of many campaigns but by the time the regiment disembarked at plymouth on oct 14 1914 the old loyalties had 
 been submerged and now there was but one loyalty to a fair and talented princess named patricia and one determination 
 to follow the precepts laid down by francis farquhar and earn his commendation in three short months he had taken 
 the flaming spirit of hamilton gault the cold courage and training of buller and the talents and vices of a 
 thousand officers and men into his slim hands and molded them to a new purpose and in a new image 
 and had laid surely and solidly the foundations of a great regiment in late december the patricia s were in 
 france and on the 6th of january 1915 the men were in the trenches none of us who came later 
 can visualize those early trenches in and around ypres shallow ditches filled with mud and water parapets which in many 
 places would not stop a bullet no communication trenches and often isolated from the trenches on either side in addition 
 the stench of rotting flesh from bodies of former occupants disenterred time after time by the never ceasing enemy shell 
 fire that these early patricia s stood up to these appalling conditions 0:condi 0:tions and the constant probing of the 
 enemy speaks well for their courage training and endurance through it all they had the flaming example of their commanding 
 officer and they could not let francis farquhar down one of the men who lived through the dreary hell of 
 that winter wrote much later and each night at each fresh alarm that gallant gentleman came among his men to 
 inspire them with the freshness of his own courage his ever ready smile bespoke the tender heart which thrived despite 
 a lifetime of military training it was at the worst moments that he came to stand with his men radiating 
 such a store of cheer and bandinage as to uplift the dullest of them and feed anew the fighting fire 
 of each so he stayed until tidings came of worse than this befalling down the line it was then that 
 the quality of the perfect officer welled up in the great heart of the man good night my children he 
 faded off amidst the graves and mist not once but many times men swore mightily and registered this oath that 
 francis farquhar could have my heart s blood but farquhar was more than a leader and moulder of men he 
 was 
 the patrician 83 as well a brilliant professional soldier in those early days the regimental commander had more scope than 
 was given those who followed he sighted many of his own trenches made his own dispositions and in many ways 
 was his own master it was francis farquhar who planned and executed the first reconnaissance in force the trench raid 
 which was adopted by the whole british army the raid may not have altered the over all strategy of the 
 war but there is no doubt that it harassed the enemy and it certainly raised the morale of our own 
 fighting men in another field departing from precedent he recommended men from the ranks for commissions in their own unit 
 and five were so promoted before his death this practice was followed by his successors and before the end of 
 the war 335 men were commissioned 104 of whom served in the regiment for the man who disdained enemy bullets 
 and shell fire and spent so much time in the open between his headquarters and the trenches and between isolated 
 trenches too there could be but one end and the end came all too soon on the night of march 
 19th after the regiment had been relieved he was hit by a chance bullet while showing the commanding officer of 
 the relieving battalion over the new line of defence which he farquhar had planned his wound was mortal and he 
 died in the dressing station before morning the following letter written by one of his junior officers eloquently voices the 
 thoughts of all who knew him france march 22nd 1915 dear lady evelyn last night we paid our last respects 
 to the colonel it was the first beautiful evening we have had the lovely sunset still slightly tinged the sky 
 a new moon and the stars were quiet and clear overhead a warm stillness 0:still 0:ness and peacefulness seemed with 
 us as we stood by the grave yet just beyond there was the constant crackle of rifles now and then 
 the whine of a bullet or the loud explosion of a bomb peace upon one side war upon the other 
 it all seemed a token of the termination of a soldier s life and the beginning of the peacefulness of 
 death we stood at the meeting place of the two have we the right to grieve for the dead who 
 have lived and died as the colonel we can only be sorry for ourselves and each other his face showed 
 no sign of suffering or regret he died while sleeping there is not a man in the regiment who does 
 not feel a great and personal loss no other man in so short a time could have won so much 
 respect and affection as a canadian i feel a national debt of gratitude to him an imperial officer who could 
 have commanded die highest position in the english army he accepted the task of creating as well as commanding a 
 new and untried canadian regiment he knew well how to combine the discipline and dignity of the regular rritish army 
 with the easy independence and democracy of a volunteer colonial regiment at all times he exercised a tact and kindness 
 which removed difficulties or overcame them he more than any other has given us a reputation and a standard which 
 we must strive to maintain he himself is with us no longer but his influence and his memory will endure 
 with the life of the regiment 
 the patrician 84 after the short simple service that evening general fortescue addressed us he said that the loss was 
 not only our s but the division s and that of the whole arm as well he personally he said 
 had never met a finer soldier nor a nobler man he tried to say more but could not some of 
 the men too broke down i was with the colonel for some time at headquarters not long before he was 
 wounded we were in the low cellar of a ruined farmhouse immediately 0:immedi 0:ately behind the firing trenches he chatted 
 and discussed the trenches in his cool humourous way we separated and i did not see him again i can 
 hardly yet realize the extent of my own personal loss i had real affection for the colonel in a way 
 i have felt for very few men he was always so friendly so encouraging i was anxious to do well 
 in order to please him in the firing line his coolness and courage had a great effect on me i 
 hardly felt any nervousness if i were with him and i had entire confidence in his judgment he has helped 
 me and given me chances in every way it was he who wrote general snow and commended me after our 
 attack i owe him a great deal and if i too must die i cannot have a higher ideal than 
 to die as he did in your great grief these things must comfort you yours very sincerely talbot m papineau 
 francis farquhar did not die and will not die as long as princess patricia s canadian light infantry is in 
 being today his great spirit hovers over the hamilton gault barracks in edmonton fort macleod in germany and the highways 
 and byways of the world wherever the men who wear the regimental badges may be found his precepts and example 
 which he so firmly rooted in his contemporaries and those who have followed 0:fol 0:lowed after have coloured and enriched 
 the lives of the thousands who through the last fifty years have served in the regiment and now live their 
 humdrum civilian lives blow out you bugles over the rich dead there s none of these so lonely and poor 
 of old but dying has made us rarer gifts than gold r g b compliments of tegler building downtown edmonton

 1965 another good year in the annals of the winnipeg branch of the association good in the respect we were 
 able to keep up our welfare program and give much needed help to our widows and orphans as well as 
 to patricias who were finding the road a little rocky with excellent co operation and aid from our ladies auxiliary 
 and the benevolence of business firms in the city we have been able to completely 0:com 0:pletely clothe our twenty 
 seven orphans and widows with the proper seasonal 0:sea 0:sonal clothing and shoes bedding consisting of blankets sheets pillows and 
 cases have been supplied one young lady entering nurse s training was completely outfitted with uniforms a nurse s watch 
 and all the essentials 0:es 0:sentials a widow s home was painted throughout and inlaid linoleum drapes and curtains supplied 
 christmas hampers and gifts were sent to six families to help brighten up their festive season employment was obtained for 
 four patricias during the year without the help of our good ladies a lot of this would have been left 
 undone although a small organization in numbers they have been big in their help and in the work they have 
 willingly given through rummage sales bake sales and numerous small projects they have raised money which has been a big 
 asset to our branch 
 the patrician 98 our congratulations go out to the four young people who were the recipients of the ladies auxiliary 
 scholarship awards in 1965 caroline campbell catharine nicholson margaret squibb and garth perkins we held two reunions during the year 
 one in may and the second in october both were well attended some three hundred patricias their wives and friends 
 at each most of the credit for the success of these two get togethers must go to our president lloyd 
 martindale who doubling as entertainment chairman was the work horse for both engagements our branch lost three stalwart supporters this 
 last year in lieutenant colonel vince lilley who was posted to cyprus mr jack shirkie transferred 0:trans 0:ferred to st 
 catharines ontario and mr syd larmon who is now residing in edmonton alberta their loss is greatly felt by this 
 branch but we know they are doing whatever they can to further the name patricia in their new localities the 
 executive of this branch during 1965 consisted of honorary president dr ce corrigan honorary vice president r bob dunn padre
