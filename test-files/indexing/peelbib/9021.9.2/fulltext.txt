 i tried to break the spell he sang on in two months he died of a broken heart and of
 rapid consumption and i buried him in a lodge on the crest of one of the foothills many of the

 the masters of the prairie no longer but have been overborne by a superior race diseases were attributed to the

 spirits of the prairies are believed to use these freaks of nature as residences some of them presiding over the

 use by all the medicine men and poisons are also employed with more or we may smile at the ignorance
 of the less fatal results every man is believed natives in their treatment of disease and the medical priesthood may

 more which had to be planed with an old than half a century on the warpath fort benton some time
 ago 40 head of horses were stolen on the teton by cree indians a pursuing party was organized and followed
 the thieves into the cree camp near fort walsh complaint was made to the mounted police authorities and col irvine
 immediately set about recovering the horses the indians horses were rounded up and branded horses to the number of 26
 were identified and turned over to their owners these were all of the 40 head that could be found at
 that time but among them are some of the most valuable horses taken and include the galbreath s t a
 11 i o n and j d weatherwax s animals the indians especially the young bucks objected strenuously for a
 long time to giving up their plunder and declared that they would fight first but the counsels of the older
 men finally prevailed however those who objected and parted so reluctantly with the horses are determined to get even they
 have taken the war path and a large party had started before the horses were fairly given up for this
 side of the line declaring their intentions of making a grand cleanup of horseflesh and moreover of keeping them next
 time unless they were recovered after a fight so we give ranchmen especially those on the teton and marias warning
 let them look sharp to their horses a messenger was sent from fort walsh to spread the news of the
 war party s approach fort macleod gazette july 1 1882 early explorations along the bow and saskatchewan rivers by james
 nevin wallace probably everyone in calgary has at one time or another paid a visit to the district called bowness
 to the west of the city when entering the city park by the main gate a heavily timbered hill may
 be seen about half a mile to the west and south of the park probably few people have ever noticed
 the trees on the hill and the few who have done so have probably dismissed them from their minds with
 the idea that they have seen groves of spruce many times before but a closer look will raise a suspicion
 that the familiar outline of the spruce is wanting the trees have a heavier more rounded top the f o
 1 i a g e is darker the branches more massed together and if a person goes actually up to
 the trees he cannot but be impressed with their stately form some of them running to two feet in diameter
 well over 150 years old these trees are not spruce they are which we know by the names bow and

 first white men to go down these rivers about eight years earlier that is in 1786 a post called manchester
 house thompson on this occasion in the year had been established by the hudson s 1800 travelled from the camp
 at high bay company about 40 miles above river up the bow river as far as the battleford the trend
 of the trade was gap returned again toward calgary much more rapid along the north than and then went northwest
 to rocky mounalong the south branch owing to the tam house if he ever established the uneven temper of the
 southern indians post now known as old bow fort it must they seemed to have been friendly as a have
 been on this journey or a year or rule but were so liable at any moment so later but the
 whole history of the to break out in murder and plunder ruins called old bow fort is in an unthat
 no reliance could be placed on satisfactory condition them among the party who established manchester house was david thomp nothing
 in the way of exploration or son then sixteen years old the post trade has been recorded along the upper

 the flood and who had been a partner of the north the next time thompson visited the west company in
 charge of several upper part of the river was from rocky posts on the north saskatchewan deter mountain house in
 1800 he travelled mined to go up the south branch as far as he could and there establish a win

 finally at canoes and 25 men and travelled up the the union he became chief factor and river which he
 calls bow river without was subsequently governor of assiniany other name from the forks near boia prince albert unfortunately macdonald
 s accounts of his travels were writ the dread of the blackfoot was great ten long after his retirement from
 the fur in those early days and palliser writing trade and he is sometimes very indefin 35 years later states
 that on this occasion the company sent up 100 men with ite mackenzie but even with that number he does
 not specify the exact place they could not hold the post for more he selected for his winter post which
 he than a few years during which time they called new chesterfield house in all lost a considerable number shot
 down probability it was where the later by the blackfoot at last the place was chesterfield house stood which we
 abandoned as being too costly and too know was close to the mouth of the red dangerous and it was
 never occupied deer river it has been stated that a post again had been built in the same locality in
 1791 while the authority for this does the next event in order of time along not appear yet macdonald s
 name the river of which we have record apwould indicate that there had been an pears to have been the
 establishment of earlier post 1 a post called peigan post 2 elsewhere i have put forward the suggestion that here
 macdonald joined soon after by this post stood at the site commonly the h b co built houses and remained
 called old bow fort and that some at during the winter when spring came least of the ruins there are
 really the rethey put everything movable into their mains not of any post so far back as canoes and went
 back down the river 1801 but of peigan post built in 1832 we know that in 1832 rocky mountain chesterfield
 house does not seem to house was ordered to be closed and a have been occupied again until after the
 new post was to be built to trade with union one of the reasons being that a the peigans but
 we have no direct statenew post had been established on the same river in 1805 six miles south of the
 1 at the time this paper was written a number former ill fated south branch fort but of detailed histories
 and documents had not yet a year after the union that is in 1822 been published to clarify the history
 of chester the hudson s bay company sent up a field house the first post was built near the confluence
 of the south saskatchewan and red deer large party of men under donald mac rivers by peter fidler of the
 hudson s bay co kenzie and re established chesterfield in 1800 traders from the north west company house this time
 at least we know ap and xy company soon had posts nearby by the proximately where it was for its
 site is spring of 1802 these had all proven to be unprofitable and were abandoned an attempt was shown on
 palliser s may as being on mode in the winter of 1804 05 by john mcdonald the north side of
 red deer river and of the nwc and joseph howse of the hbc to about three miles above its confluence
 re open the trade but again they were unsuccesswith the south saskatchewan it was jul and the new posts were
 abandoned the final try was made in 1821 when donald mckenzie of very probably on the tongue of land the
 hbc again built chesterfield house when about three miles below the present em it proved to be too dangerous it
 was abandoned press it seems some effort should be in april of 1823 and never re opened made to identify
 the exact place so as to 2 a detailed study of peigan post has been made have it marked in
 some way by j b a macleod of calgary so that its history is no longer in doubt it was
 established by the donald mackenzie was a brother of hudson s bay co in 1832 and rocky mountain roderick founder
 of fort chipewyan on house was closed the intention was to lure the peigan indians away from the newly established
 lake athabasca and cousin of the great american forts on the missouri however the explorer alexander donald who had plan
 failed and peigan post was abandoned in been first with the n w co had subse january of 1834 this
 site became known as old quently become one of the chief men of bow fort and is still given this
 name by local historians see peigan post and the blackfoot astor s fur trading venture at the mouth trade by
 i e a maclead canadian historical of the columbia river and when the review sept 1943 pp 273 79 ment
 where this new post stood during barter was chiefly for provisions that is the two years of its existence 1833
 and pemmican and buffalo robes and very few fine furs were obtained so that by the 1834 it clearly had
 connection with time the goods were transported and the rocky mountain house and palliser s few furs sent to lake
 winnipeg very little account of the history of old bow fort profit resulted besides frequent attacks were made on them
 by the blackfeet and beside which he camped 66 years ago several of the company s servants lost their in
 august 1858 seems to confirm the lives in defending the establishment view that it was a hudson s bay company
 post established for the peigan the remark that the furs went to lake trade if the post had been built
 by winnipeg might be construed to mean thompson it would have been a north that they were sent down the
 bow river west company post and it should be and south saskatchewan but it is more remembered that when writing
 his re probable that they would go overland port palliser had the advantage of hay to rocky mountain house by
 the ancient ing spent a winter at rocky mountain stony indian trail from the modern mor house where no doubt
 he had often ley and then down the north branch to discussed earlier days in the trade edmonton so as

 separate grounds firstly there was its is with the americans charter in virtue of which it claimed all chief justice
 draper who appeared the area which drained to hudson bay before the same committee for canada which included all of
 manitoba nearly said that rival traders had the effect of all of saskatchewan and all of southern demoralizing the indians
 by a free use alberta except the watershed of a few of intoxicants to draw trade and caused small streams
 in the south such as milk bloodshed between the rivals themand frenchman rivers this large area selves he added that
 while much of the was known to the company as rupert s opposition to the company was undoubt land secondly
 in the year 1821 when edly based on patriotic motives yet he the h b co and n w co
 were amal would not be fair if he did not state that gamated the imperial government sim some of the
 most prominent opposition ultaneously granted an exclusive right really arose from men eager to share in to trade with the
 indians in all parts of the profits of trade british north america not covered by the charter this license which
 was for the area covered by this exclusive 21 years was part of the policy of the license was known
 as the indian ternimperial authorities when they had in tory in distinction to that known as sisted on union as
 a means to stop the rupert s land the license was renewed strife and bloodshed between the two in 1838
 for another 21 years not howrivals strenuous objections were made ever without opposition in the imperial against such a policy
 of exclusive trade house canada in those days taking especially in later years when it became little interest in the
 matter and this secrather the fashion to attack the hudson s ond term was drawing to a close as the
 bay company on almost every imagin year 1859 approached able ground yet this was one of many cases not sufficiently
 recognized in can the third basis for the hudson s bay ada where the imperial government company claims was a

 the imperial parlia the company did not wait until the mentary committee in 1857 bore testi license and grant would
 end but apmony to the need of keeping out rivals plied in 1857 for renewals in this they so as
 not to weaken the authority of the were following the common policy that h b co it is easier to
 negotiate a new term be fore the old one expires people being years of its existence nothing said thus taken
 off their guard as it were the attorney and the solicitor general of and only realizing the opportunity of the
 england could be more opposed to a end of a term when too late british sense of justice than to
 deal with this charter or principles which might be in this case however the general applicable if it had been
 granted only march of events had brought about a 10 years ago strong opposition in the imperial house and an
 opposition somewhat less effec while the committee was sitting the tive because viewed from too narrow a chairman who was

 committee ities expressed its indebtedness is well worthy of study especially by those who it is however remarkable that palare
 not prone to give fair credit to the user never refers to the exploration desire to reach just conclusions which
 going on immediately to the east of him characterized the imperial government when dealing with contentious matters palliser reached fort
 garry in july of the surrender of rupert s land 1857 and exploring as he travelled westerly along the usual
 route via fort the mistake made all through the ellice and qu appelle he reached the negotiations by many people
 in canada elbow at th e end of august he then was that they treated the charter and travelled up
 the south side of the river the company as a thing of yesterday for about 25 miles there was at
 that deriving no right except from the actual time a constant war going on between wording of the charter instead
 of recog the crees and the blackfoot as recently nizing the accumulated force of the 200 as the spring of
 that year seventeen out were never there of course he was depending on his latitude observations the latitude of carlton
 having been accurately found many years before by franklin and other explorers when the men found to their surprise that
 it was late next day when they reached the post palliser says they entertained the most exalted ideas of the
 power of his sextant at carlton they found richard hardisty in charge here hector and the others were to have
 their headquarters while palliser left for fort garry travelling this time by the more northerly route by way of touchwood
 at touchwood he states that he was most hospitably received on october 15 1857 by mr thomas taylor who was
 in charge a digression may here be made to point out that while frequent accusations some of them unjust have
 been brought against the hudson s bay company that it opposed any effort to make known western conditions every traveller
 and explorer bears testimony to the assistance he has received at the hands of the company s officers blakiston one
 of palliser s assistants says they seemed anxious to rival one another in good offices to a stranger and that
 no charge was ever made while living at any of the company s posts the two prominent men of the
 palliset ex pedition were capt john palliser left and sir james hector these men led the parties which made detailed
 studies of the western canadian prairies foothills and mountains of a band of twenty five crees had been killed by
 blackfoot close to the elbow the blackfoot using bows and arrows and rolling large stones down on the crees palliser
 s intention was to travel up the south branch as far as the mouth of red deer river and from
 there to go north to canton where he had been instructed to winter when this intention was announced it was
 received with alarm by all his men who thought they had done wonders in getting so far into the blackfoot
 country even his right hand man among the halfbreeds the redoubtable mackay stated that persistence in such intention would break
 up the whole party finally palliser decided it would be unwise to go on so on september 27 he crossed
 the river to the north side and set out for carlton when still a considerable distance from carlton some of
 his men who had been at that post some years before became indignant with palliser for camping one evening when
 they said they could easily reach the post before dark to palliser s assertion that they could hardly get there
 even by next evening they replied how do you know you father desmet visiting rocky mountain house from oregon writes
 mr j e harriott although a protestant received me with a politeness truly fraternal he is a most amiable gentleman
 these qualities characterize all the gentlemen of the h b co in may of the following year 1858 palliser returned
 to canton and the expedition moved westerly around the elbow and then to red deer river which they crossed to
 the south about fifteen miles east of the present town of red deer finally they fell in with the buffalo
 and camped at the place marked slaughter camp on his map this was on rosebud river close to the present
 irricana here palliser divided his party going straight south himself with one on two men while hector and the rest
 went up the bow river palliser states that on his way south he reached a salty lake two miles long
 and half a mile wide after katchewan the pass was named by palriding six hours this seems to be ches
 user after a legendary indian who made termere lake which however he names a wonderful recovery from the blow of
 lake oscar on his map showing it about an axe but there is a difference of five miles north of
 the mouth of pine opinion as to whether the indian s name creek they pushed on until long after was
 kananaskis or kananaski it seems dark and camped without wood or the latter is the correct form and that the
 water when next morning they found terminal s is really possessive and to their surprise that they were close according
 to modern rules of naming to the river we can readily believe pal should be omitted palliser used three liser
 s remark that they hurried down different forms in his reports and maps as fast as possible to account for
 the long time from chestermere lake if it from the summit palliser went west was that lake we may assume
 they node to kootenay riven and returned again straight south ignorant of the sudden by the same pass but came
 east down southerly bend in the river and not find the highwood river from which he went log it they
 turned off sharply to the west north to his winter quarters at edmonton to look for it there they crossed
 by the crude means of while palliser had been making his rolling their few belongings in a tent trip to
 the south and then northwest to and towing the bundle behind their old bow fort and kananaskis pass horses which
 had to swim the river at hector had gone west up bow river he length they reached the boundary notes
 dream hill which is the modern where in full view of chief mountain big hill near cochrane certainly a case
 palliser made the latitude 49 05 he where the old name should have been then turned north and travelling some
 retained and then he crossed deadman what west of his former route he tried to river now known as ghost
 river he make directly for old bow fort but get notes old bow fort but gives no inforting into difficulties
 had to back out to motion about it proceeding up the river ward the east and then turn south again
 he turns south to examine what he calls on august 4 1858 he states that he an old neglected pass
 formerly used came in view of the south saskatchewan by the cree war parties and which they river near the
 mouth of kananaskis called vermilion pass he went over river he does not even mention the al this summit down
 the western side to ternative name bow on this occasion beaverfoot riven up that stream northwesterly and over a local
 divide and bow river was crossed about four so reached the lower part of kicking miles above old bow fort
 and he found horse river this he followed up easthis men camped there with very little erly and so reached
 the pass of the same meat but with a very great deal of fear name if thompson did not go
 oven this of the blackloot summit at one time or another as some from here palliser went up kanana people
 believe then hector was the first skis river and explored the pass of that white man who came through in
 any name of the existence of the pass he event he is the first to call attention to states he
 was told by james sinclair a the pass and it is therefore the more resident near red river as far
 back as regrettable that the present ugly name the year 1848 sinclair had said that he should have been given
 to it directly by intended to use this pass the next time hector himself the name is derived from he
 should cross the mountains and pal a serious kick received by hector himuser believed that he subsequently had self from
 a horse while at the point of crossed the pass starvation they were making their way easterly up the river
 on the western at the summit they found a small lake river hector states that the men called draining to
 the pacific close to the the river kicking horse from the acciheadwaters of kananaskis river and dent and it was
 from the river that the palliser remarked that while their tea pass received its name if he had known pail
 was filled with pacific slope water that it would be traversed by a contintheir scanty supper of tough elk meat
 ental railway he would no doubt have was boiling in the waters of the sas chosen some more graceful name
 but no member of the expedition ever antici river this he did and following down pated that a railway would
 go that way that river passed rocky mountain house that is the unfortunate history of so and reached edmonton many
 unsatisfactory names the feature part of the following winter was spent at the time seems to be of little importance
 and a name is carelessly given by palliser with the blackfoot near often merely as a temporary expedient rocky mountain
 house ostensibly he states for the purpose of hunting but yet the unsuitable name clings and not really to get
 acquainted with the inonly that but it is repeated for many dians so as to facilitate his next season s
 other different features in the vicinity work from the summit hector travelled next season 1859 palliser had a difeasterly down
 a small stream and after ficult time getting a party together as a few miles came to a larger stream
 every one in edmonton had a dread of from the northwest and then to a large going south among the
 blackfoot finriver which he states his stony indian ally he collected what he called a motat once recognized as bow
 river and ley crowd of 15 persons and they all after a little time he himself began to travelled by
 way of handhills and then recognize the mountains about 20 miles southerly to berry creek to the red deer to
 the east it would seem therefore that river and down near that river first on hector was not sure of
 where he was the north side and then on the south travelling until he had actually come side until he
 reached its confluence with some miles down bow river the south saskatchewan the latter river was forded and they passed
 westerly after coming down the river for some distance some stony indians were met the construction of the c p
 r through the with and hector then decided to go mountains was a great engineering feat this northwest over bow
 pass and so reach view taken august 1 st 1884 shows the end of the headwaters of north saskatchewan the

 palliser going west the railway which crosses the prairies through the pass now known as blak as far south as
 possible very probably iston pass to the south of crow s nest a route even further south than kicking while
 hector followed up the south side horse pass would have been searched of south saskatchewan and bow riven for had
 not the condition been laid down past where calgary now stands and that the pass followed must be at least
 from there travelled some distance up 100 miles from the boundary the present elbow river which at that time and
 indeed almost until the arrival the wish to have a southern route of the c p r was known as
 swift creek was not long in fathering the thought that such a route was feasible and one striking off to
 the northwest he of the means to bring this to pass was crossed the modern jumping pond creek the employment
 of an american enwhich he calls tent creek and so gineer as the american practice of the reached palliser s
 former ford near old day tolerated grades and curves which bow fort where he crosses bow river were very distasteful
 to british en he then turned west went up pipestone gineers major rogers the engineer empass over the local divide
 to north sas ployed we may well believe was put katchewan river and so down to ed on his metal
 to get the railway through monton kicking horse pass and it must be remembered in regard to what follows very
 little survey work or exploration that he was a most experienced railway was done along the upper part of bow
 engineer before he came north river for the present route of the c p r until the year 1882 in
 1871 an attempt rogers in the year 1881 stated that his had been made to get a line through route
 would go up bow riven to the kick howse pass at the headwaters of north ing horse pass and that
 he could safely saskatchewan river but in the next assure a descent from the summit to the year it was
 found that yellowhead pass columbia not exceeding 80 feet to the was very suitable and no further sur mile that
 would be about 1 ½ percent veys were made for any pass further application was soon after made to the
 south so long as the undertaking was a government for permission to go by government enterprise in february 1881 kicking
 horse pass and this was the whole undertaking surveys con granted struction and everything else was in 1882 rogers reported
 that an exturned over to a company and it was cellent grade had been found to the east not long
 before the northern route was down bow river the maximum being 37 abandoned the desire to adopt a more feet
 to the mile but he remarked that southerly route than that through ed the location down the west was not
