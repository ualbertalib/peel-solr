 cousins there is one claim to discovery in the crow s nest pass area about which controversy has raged and
 because it has been widely publicized by press and radio and stated in books intended for use in alberta schools
 it is necessary to discuss it here in august 1941 there appeared in the lethbridge herald an article by freda
 graham bundy entitled a link with the past which told of the discovery of a small lead plaque with the
 following inscription on it anno xxvi regni ludovici xv prorege illustrissimo domino domino marchione de beauharnois mdccxxxxi petro gaultier de
 laverendrie posuit on the reverse face was a roughly scratched message pose par le chevalyer de lay to st louy
 la londette a miotte le 30 de mars 1743 mrs bundy had purchased a box containing odds and ends at
 an auction sale at drewry s glen ranch on todd creek near the mouth of the crow s nest pass
 this box lay unused and neglected until 1935 when quite by accident the plaque was discovered in it mr drewry
 was dead by this time but his brother thought that the lead plate might have been dug up with some
 other relics when the basement of the house was excavated about 1915 this spot had always been a favorite camping
 site for indians as artifacts had been turned up there several times before and since mrs bundy brought her plaque
 personally to the public archives of canada but had heard nothing further from them although some readers of the 1941
 article had written to the press to say that they had similar plaques which were souvenirs the present writer decided
 to follow columbia river historical expedition july 1926 up the story the original la verendrye compliments of the great northern
 railway plaque was discovered at fort pierre south dakota in 1913 and from his the drewry plaque had no such
 inown journal it would appear that la scription verendrye placed only one plaque and inquiry at the great northern railway
 that in the area near fort pierre the public relations office revealed that they public archives sent the writer photographs
 of both the drewry and fort were reasonably certain that the inscription was put on all plaques that they pierre
 plaques while a rubbing was issued dr william kaye lamb the obtained from a known replica left by dominion archivist
 who has shown conthe late judge howay to the library of the university of british columbia the the spelling appears
 as tod and todd on howay plaque had printed upon it different maps this paper is taken from a master
 s thesis prepared by mr cousins at the university of alberta edmonton in 1952 mr cousins is now dean of
 lethbridge junior college 1 siderable interest in the discovery found to make peace with tne icootenays who that replicas were
 also struck in 1925 were in a state of great fear after numerin connection with the upper missouri ous clashes
 it has been stated that de historical expedition it was his surmise smet chose the western end of the that
 the plaques were made in two series crow s nest pass for the first part of one with and one
 without the great the trip but since it has been established northern stamp dr lamb compared the almost certainly that
 he went through rubbing of the replica with the drewry white man pass this is scarcely likely plaque and arrived
 at the following con however there is other evidence that clusion 2 he visited the valley of the elk several
 times in a letter he said the fine ‘ 1 the back af the two plates are absolutely identical so
 far as the ordinary river des chutes comes roaring down eye can see and crosses the plain before it joins
 its 2 the inscriptions on the front are like waters to the mcgillivray kootenay wise identical but in order to
 leave and having remarked large pieces room for the great northern railway inscription the railway company of coal along the
 river i am convinced placed the whole inscription slightly that this fossil could be abundantly prohigher up on the plaque
 cured he is obviously referring to the in a later letter dr lamb concludes elk river the only one noted
 for coal i have hunted up an early descrip in those parts hence de smet was both tion of the
 original plaque and i find the first known traveller in the pass and that it measured 81 2 by 6
 1 2 inches the discoverer of its coal if the alberta plaque 31 4 by 21 i is the palliser
 expedition in 1858 first genuine we must assume therefore that gave recognition to the crow s nest pass la verendrye
 not only duplicated his by that name lieutenant later captain rough inscription with uncanny ac thomas blakiston had been charged
 curacy but accomplished this feat while with exploring kootonay pass to see at the same time greatly reducing the if
 it lay in british territory blakiston scale of the copy this seems to me a after a dispute with palliser
 went off most improbable feat and makes it all from the main party and his account the more certain that
 all the small appears in the section of the palliser plaques are merely modern copies report known as further papers
 he if the plaque had proved to be an listed the pass as a known pass at 49 original it
 would have been a fine start degrees 40 minutes north latitude and ing point for this article but it does
 called it the crow nest pass the not seem to be so also much to the north kootonay was given

 that early wards between the livingstone range travellers had little regard for the pass and the porcupines which was conwhich

 photographed near pincher creek in 1895 road and seldom used there was camping site near some hotsprings however a well
 defined path when he where michel creek comes into the elk crossed it in august and he ob phillipps stated
 that he had been there served the old trail coming in from the with peter boyle in the 1860 s

 river it would be intesest owes its name they decided to follow ing to know which of the crow s
 nest up michel creek and after travelling series of passes was followed by the through heavy timber for several days
 indians who were almost all flatheads found large trails which were certainly or kootenays and who would have not elk
 trails passing out towards the turned south as soon as possible to lake phillipps writes we found trees reach the
 tobacco plains when michael covered with buffalo hair and it was phillipps came through about fifteen evident to both of
 us that we had passed years later there was no sign of a trail through the rocky mountains without along
 the route now traveued by the going over any range this is the first road and railway trip ever made
 by what is now known as the crow s nest pass phillipps michael phillipps is by all available realized the
 importance of a pass with evidence the first white man to tra no mountain to go over so he decided
 verse the crow s nest pass he had to work for a trail been a factor in the hudson s
 bay company posts in montana and idaho and his account is somewhat vague for when all posts in the western
 part of he gives no details of the route he took the united states were sold phillipps or to what
 lake he was referring or post at tobacco plains was among them why it took several days to go not
 more being free for a time he decided to go than ten miles or even how the hot northward to
 do some prospecting in springs became moved about twenty five 1873 in company with john collins a miles to the
 south neither does he trapper he started north up the elk mention meeting any white settlers in the area w
 s lee was already settled valley no fire had then swept the valley and although there were no trails ‘
 michael phillipps memories of thirty years ago the going was comparatively easy published in a special edition of the fernie
 press they camped a few days at the place in 1905 all of the following narrative is from this account
 there are few of these books left where fernie was later built then since the fire of 1908 but mr
 wallace of fernie moved north and rediscovered an old formerly of the free press has one 3 by the lake
 which bears his name and in the same article phillipps tells ol he claimed that in the same year 1873
 sending dr dawson a sample of coal he travelled from his ranch up to where and a rough pen sketch
 of the elk river frank stands today and discovered the using his own names this probably sulphur springs there he
 said that it explains why local names and governwas the year before the police came to ment names are more
 in accord on the the country e west side of the pass in the summer of 1874 phillipps re once
 the pass had been opened it turned with woods william saunders was soon one of the main connections and jim
 morrissey a miner they between the kootenays and the plains found and named morrissey creek and and became one of
 the most used sumtook out some coal they named the mer trails in the country with horses next large stream
 coal creek phillipps and cattle from as far as kamloops continues we could find nothing but being driven through it
 it became a coal and coal everywhere next they matter of intense interest to the ranchers named lizard creek from
 some green of the pincher creek and fort macleod lizzards they found there jim mor district and is mentioned quite
 frequentrissey complained bitterly about finding ly in the early newspapers only coal but it was not until they went up
 the bull river two years later tn 1881 the canadian pacific railway that they found anything else they made an
 exploratory survey of the were more taken by the iron and gold crow s nest pass but the canadian they
 found here than by the vast coal government for military reasons opdeposits of the elk valley posed any main line
 so near the international boundary in the same year phillipps was able to persuade the alexander staveley hill went through
 british columbia government to grant garnett s ranch to the mouth of the pass him a small sum to define
 the trail and tells of a settler who had tried according to phillipps gold commis ranching well up into the
 valley but sioner william fernie opposed this plan now had settled near the mouth of it saying the indians say
 there was no in 1882 john craig went from the such pass and there is no use wasting oxley ranch
 at granum on a quick dash the money however phillipps and up into the pass but mentions no settlers a
 mr ridgeway blazed the path through at all and the trail was made staveley hill was unable to find a
 there is a rather curious fact here police post that he thought was at police which needs explaining phillipps nar
 flat in 1881 which suggests that a rative describes the route now traversed temporary station might have been by the
 railway and one would conclude placed there about that time in 1883 that the trail went that way yet in
 because of the increase in cattle rustling 1883 dawson followed the well defined through the pass a permanent post was
 road which went directly from island established with two men in charge lake through tent mountain pass and fairly substantial
 log buildings were southwestward to coal creek and then erected there in 1887 and the following into the elk valley

 seams of three feet and three feet any known indian trail the indians six inches in the river bank a
 few miles still preferred the north kootanie below the falls lundbreck on the pass because it was more direct the
 middle fork he was more excited map accompanying the report shows the about the prospect of going up into the
 pass with two summits going from island pass the following year lake across michel and marten creeks to coal creek
 and into the elk valley the most interesting feature of the explorations was the discovery that in the region where
 fernie is today of the crow s nest pass wide valleys based on cretaceous rock occur west of the first
 the passage between turtle and bluff range which is formed of paleozoic lime mountains he called the gap a name
 stone and that in the cretaceous rock an which is now used for the opening in important intercalation of volcanic
 material the livingstone range where the oldappears in which traces at least of copper ores occur it is possible that
 in some of man north fork flows the now isolated troughs of cretaceous rocks coal beds may yet be found

 return after covering only a as monotonous and plateaulike in outline he believed that the coal bearing few miles and

 area had been both burned and logged came down from them over and the small pines of from fifteen to
 twenty feet high that barred the way dawson was not the only notable were easily removed by bulldozers visitor to

 account is more original road got around the barrier of interesting to the modern resident than crowsnest lake did it
 follow the route that of dawson s description because now taken by the railway or did it go it is
 less concerned with geology and through phillipps pass or as the local more with the notable surface features inhabitants say
 over the summit craig considered that civilization ended according to dawson the old trail at the ranch of john lee
 but up at the turning to the north at the east or lower sulphur springs he found a pioneer in
 a end of the crowsnest lake ran west log cabin who proposed to build a ward nearly parallel to it
 in a narrow sanatorium there the visiting rancher dry valley a better track has lately called bluff mountain the lion

 half a dozen jumps before john turned him over he had him tied in no time but in his anxiety
 to make time did the work carelessly and before the limit five minutes expired the steer kicked himself clear and

 some of them 1 ½ miles long and the highest grade skinners or one who not a tree in sight
 for miles and miles skins six the middle grade skins four it s nearly always blazing sunshine but and the
 lowest two one feels very grand mostly there s an icy wind blowing all skinning six all day in the

 porridge and pie varied by pork had happened and told me to jam down beans and tomatoes pronounced most my

 lends me some who daren t go back for some reason times to fetch the three old cows in unexplained
 they are always together from the pasture or to chase home the and seldom say very much to anyone forty
 odd horses off the range on sunday else though they are the cleanest of the evening where they spend the
 week lot and have been soldiers there is end it s a little bucking beast and one man from manchester
 in fact so every time he bucks i rock forward so much so as to be almost unintelligible that my
 stomach gets dug heavily into and the rest are sheer canadian oh by the horn on the front of the
 saddle and i forgot a finn who calls jam it hurts most horribly but i haven t yam and syrup
 seerop also quiet parted from him yet and cleanly we had a belgian who came the day before me but
 he left the company is rather odd to put because he was afraid of his horses he it mildly but
 they are jolly good fellows was simply filthy the farm hand type at heart once you are acclimatized to is

 have been on three things with my six team the plough the may 29 1925 friday again and toseeder and
 the packer but as the seed morrow i shall take this into town in ing and ploughing is nearly finished
 the little wagon called a democrat and they are putting me back on the packer post it the most monotonous
 of all from day s i am having just as good a time as end to day s end i
 sit perched on this ever and am very happy everyone is huge roller affair clanking up and down very nice
 and kind and i am getting behind my sweating horses in a huge to be quite a teamster when you
 start cloud of powdery dust we arrive back in to work at 5 30 the day seems pretty at the
 end of the day shuffling along long but it s all jolly interesting and two miles of prairie trail ankle
 deep with it s getting particularly so now that the alkali dust and the only way you can wheat is
 coming up and we can see distinguish which is horse and which whether we have been successful in is harness
 is the sweat streaks it s our efforts awful stuff to clean out of them and my back and arms
 ache fit to bust it s a a farmer at home would have a fit man s job to get
 it off myself as well if a team of horses and a plough was to drive all over his fields
 cutting great you get too dry if you try and smoke long ditches through the young wheat when you are
 working so i carry a and leaving hoof prints all over the pocketful of corn out of the seeder and
 place here they think nothing of it chew mouthfuls of that and then spit and it makes apparently no difference
 it out it s not very nice but it keeps to the wheat which immediately springs one s mouth moist
 and one s lips from up again in the banks of earth either getting caked side of the furrows where
 the irrigation water goes all over the field the foreman told me today that he is very pleased with my
 work and that i succeeded this afternoon in upsethe is amazed at the way i ve caught ting a load
 of hay huge wagon huge on quicker he says than anyone he s load and six horses the leaders shied
 seen he is vastly tickled that i was an at a pair of mallards that rose from a officer he
 observed the marks on my ditch and before i could yell at them british warm where the stars had been
 to pull one wheel was in the ditch and he always stops and talks for hours the load was going
 i was on top at to me when he comes and sees me work the time and as it slowly
 capsized i was ing in the morning the others are scrambling furiously around it so as to always curious to
 know what he has be on top when it was on the ground been talking about because he never however
 i had to clear the wagon of stops long on his round with them hay before the horses could move
 it and then set to work and load it up he has arranged to pay me 50 dol again i
 shan t hear the last of that lars 1 q a month for the present and until someone else does
 something like through harvest if it is a good one they it pay about five dollars a day mr badvises
 me to save enough out of my yesterday i was upset off my plough pay to put me into an
 argricultural col on rough ground and the day before lege through the winter when i shall be yesterday one of
 my horses failed to qualified for a much better paid job appear from the pasture in the early next spring
 the colleges he tells me morning and later on was found dead are very cheap indeed and that for the
 poor marjorie who died foaling we course one only pays thirty dollars for knew there was something wrong with the
 winter though one s lodging and her because she was a cranky wildkeep have to come extra of course i
 eyed anxious old thing pulling desper 12 ately away all the time and working cursing teamsters in a spud cave
 pickat a half trot and always in distress ing over a nasty smelling collection of through doing all the work
 now i have rotting potatoes one in about ten being no horses liable to either kick or bite fit for
 consumption the rest go to the in the stable but the team is sort of pigs or rather hogs now
 that i am a slow and lazy and my new horse in good canuck and pronounced hawg marjorie s place
 is what the foreman however on the 3 rd day of sitting in the calls an idle god dam son
 of a bitch semi darkness myself and another and i have to carry a pocketful of stones turned as the
 cook put it sick at our and keep shying them at him all day stummicks and were sent out irrigating
 because he s too far in front to reach instead while those whose stummicks with the slack of the lines
 mr b were made of sterner stuff wished they d after letting some one else find out if thought of
 the device before we did i was any use has now suggested that now we are splashing about like water
 if i want a change of job at any time rats in gum boots directing water all he will take
 me into his department of over wheat oats and alfalfa it s rather the c p r as rodman to
 a surveyor but jolly letting the water out of the big that means i lose money because i ditch into
 a little ditch and cutting a should have to have a room in town hole each side in the banks
 of the little and feed myself out of what little more ditch and watching the water spread i d get
 in salary added to which i all over the section you want irrigated shouldn t be with horses or having
 any after it s spread nicely all over that thing like such a good time as i am out bit
 then you cut away the dam and here at the farm build up the banks and do it again june
 12 1925 we have had two further down we use long handled good days rain this week which has shovels
 sharpened like razors the promade everything look wonderfully green fessional irrigator owns and carries his and new and has made
 everybody feel own and when he buys it he chooses very fresh and clean it has also kept it as
 carefully as a golf club and carries the dust down a bit all ploughing a little stone to keep it
 sharp a cloth seeding and harrowing is finished so this view on the duke of sutherland s farm all the
 teams are having a rest till we shows six binders being drawn by tractors and start haying which we do
 very shortly six drawn by four horse teams at right is a i have been employed with three other lone
 stooker while at left in the carriage are m l flong and r d sangster in white shirt ‘ y
 5 4 5 1 5 y 4 5 5 ‘ 55 e f 15 13 the author found that irrigating
 the fields was preferable to sorting rotten potatoes in a root house the above scene taken in a wheat field
 in the irrigation district is typical of th irrigator s work to dry it at the end of the day
 and a they pulled so hard they broke the little wooden spoon thing to scrape the whiffle tree which was
 solid oak so mud off it he also uses it in times of it was called good enough and afterconflict
 as a weapon of offence and can wards it took four horses all their time split heads quite neatly with
 it to lift it with two new trees of course now nobody points the finger of scorn two of my
 horses won me a bet on and says there are those devils tom monday at dinner time one of the
 and henry but they look with respect teamsters came in and said he was and say those are the magnificent
 stuck with a load of oats and that as horses that broke the tree pulling at his two horses couldn
 t lift it out there the grain tank were no two on the farm could do it so they would
 have to put four on the june 19 1925 haying is in full foreman who is always poking fun at
 swing and horses and men are going me because i am so proud of my horses hard from shriek of
 dawn till sundown and bucking about their prowess laugh at about 9 at night the grey horses ingly remarked that
 henry and tom come home blue and the bay horses two of mine noted for bad behaviour come home black
 and the poor things could do it easily roars of laughter are simply falling over their feet the and i
 took him up we hooked them in hay crop is enormous this year and and when i yelled at them
 they heaved if the grain crop is nearly as good they on a steady pull for ten seconds and will
 pay a record wage i have only bang went the whiffle tree of course got two horses to drive now
 as i am both horses fell forward on their noses working with a dump rake in the alfalfa and the
 load never moved an inch but field which they have started cutting 14 henry horse and tommy dodd are my
 he won t stand any rot from the elevator two slaves and henry horse being man either if he starts
 bawling at him young and part cayuse tries to go every the old horse strikes instantly and won t time
 i clank the lever to dump a rake move full so it s eventful soon i fear he ll catch
 me napping and succeed in getting yesterday he had a load up about away i only hope i fall clear
 of the half way when the man yelled at him rake to step up faster he stopped at once and
 proceeded to back till the load was two of us have been having a ter on the ground again and
 had to be led rible day of it on the dumprakes both up to the end of his walk after
 that rakes took it into their heads to go incident the elevator man learned sense wrong mine kept on refusing
 to lift and punch behaved himself and dump the hay and his got the dumps and wouldn t stop lifting
 with i spent all day looking forward to every turn of the wheels once every my evening swim some evenings
 it s two rounds we d have to stop and try almost dark by the time i get in and
 and adjust them and then they d go the mosquitoes are something cruelwrong again and we d adjust them but
 it is the best moment of the day again until we were all hot and my two matrons minnie and
 polly are bothered and saying things about the turned out polly has a strapping foal duke and his parsimonious habits
 one and minnie expects one at any minute good thing we had to come home early they come and watch
 me swimming because they got so that nothing but every night and blow great snorts at a hammer and a
 cold chisel and some my shirt on the bank while the foolish new parts could do any good there foal
 redistributes her feet in all direcis a tame mechanic here who is sup tions minnie i m sure is its
 godmother posed to keep all machinery in running because she s always with the two of order he caught it
 we were nearly them crazy with the heat and the nuisance and the mosquitoes which get at you a cruel
 joke was played on me and whenever you keep still so someone certain others at a dance one night the
 had to be shook up we also have first i had attended here some of the nose flies which sting
 and lay in the bunch had not secured partners and horses nose and lips so that they spend felt sore
 so after the dance when we the whole day violently nodding also were sitting out with our partners they they
 wear gauze muzzles which help sauntered up very grave one of them a bit but not entirely approached and with
 a perfectly solemn face and in a very loud voice remarked henry and tom are doing real well say mike
 when you ve finished with in the rake but they are such uncertain my suit and shirt don t forget
 to hang brutes you never know what s going to them up again on my door will you happen henry
 always stands up when what was one to say it was my shirt asked to back up which is very
 perilous and my best blue suit but it was no while tom never starts normally but good explaining that all
 the girls for tries to jump through his bridle it adds yards round were in fits of laughter to the
 interest but renders one liable the only thing to do was to go with to go off the little iron
 seat backwards them while they did it to some other poor guy which i did the horse on the elevator
 has to be a very very wise and trusted old the prairie is gorgeous now all chum ours is called
 punch and is as little flowers and tiny short wild roses clever as a man he has one of those
 about six inches high gophers of enormously swollen legs which look as course are everywhere they have short if it
 s going to burst and never does ears so you can t see any ears at all so joe describ
 es him as a cross bred and think they are deaf but you are horse three quarters clyde and the
 wrong you also think they are picket other quarter thorough bred elephant pins sometimes and again you are 15 wrong
 we ran across bunches of wild jumpy about the mamas who are just range stock horses and cattle all of
 aching for a chance to run in and hook them belonging to someone but too you it nearly happened several
 times much trouble to bother with the horses but the puncher watches them and rides some of them beauties are
 all short them off and slaps them with his hat actioned when they gallop which spoils we are still stiff
 and aching a calf them to my mind weighs a good deal and when you ve thrown about fifty you
 begin to know july 12 1925 everything goes on you ve done some work we brand on from day to
 day as usual on fine days the left flank and it seems always to be we hay at high pressure
 on wet days the left flank that the calf is lying on we don t hay but haul manure and
 on and his legs surely fly around when he s the days following wet days we don t turned over
 if he kicks you his hoofs hay either the rakes go out and turn cut like razors it over but
 until it s quite dry or cured as it s called it can t be put up i have my
 plans all ready made out for getting home to see you all sometime i succeeded in persuading myself and get
 paid for doing it the only not to go to calgary with some of the thing i haven t worked
 out yet is how bunch last week for the stampede they to get back here again without paying got back
 tonight full of good cheer and i can easily get a job in calgary on bad beer having had a
 wonderful time a stock train crew and another job on a and seen a gent called greasy cox montreal or
 quebec cattle boat to liveran arizonan carry off the prince s prize pool but i don t think i could
 just face for the bucking and world s champion stoking my way across the atlantic back rider as canada has
 won it with pete again and that seems my only hope i vandemeer and pete legrande the last could do
 the work easy enough being two years it s only fair i suppose that in pretty fair shape at present
 but it the states should have it now as they would be beastly thinking of the corking got everything else
 roping hog tying time everyone was having above decks and bull dogging the thing that won the hearts of our
 bunch most of all seems if i feel i shant have enough money to have been a gentleman who drove
 for college this winter i shant trouble thirty six head of horses round the because joe says he ll gladly
 take me streets of calgary and trotted them part on as one of the two that are kept here of
 the way just think of the weight through freeze up which in its way is of leather he d be
 handling they were something of a compliment pulling six wagons loaded with grain fastened on to each other i d
 certainly the water behind the dam is sinking like to have seen that lower and lower and is getting quite
 hot at nights now the mosquitoes are last week two of us me and the quite terrible everywhere particularly manchester
 man were sent out to help at nights when they trumpet all around brand the duke s calves on the
 range you when the trumpeting ceases you me being strong spent the day wrestl have to pass a hand rapidly
 all over ing he was in charge of the fire and your face neck head and chest because the irons
 it is a moot point which got you know the little blighter is on you hottest him or me or
 the irons it just showed me the difference between the july 23 1925 haying is still in full fun you
 can have branding a few and swing and i m now using the third team sitting on the fence part
 of the time of horses since haying began the others watching the fun and the work you being so thin
 and worn that they ve can do when there are 240 husky here been turned out to pasture jock and
 ford calves to be wrestled branded ear jim they are real good horses but have marked and some of them
 cut all in a habit of chucking it in a tight place one blazing hot day the smell of burn
 so far rather awkward at times but ing hair and hide makes you feel very they haven t done it
 for the last two or very sick after a bit and you get a bit three days so maybe thoughtful
 handl 16 teamsters such as the author had great admiration for slim moorehouse driver of this team at the 1925
 calgary stampede the outfit owned by glen house consisted of 32 horses and eight grain wagons which the driver skillfully
 guided through the centre of calgary ing will cure them you feel rather a my back under a haycock after
 my fool when your horses stop and walk lunch but pat burke will have none of back just when you
 want one last good it and we have to sweat for heavens heave on a heavy load sake from the
 time we get up from lunch to the time we hook up again from we have got a lad working
 here at what i have seen of our man i feel that the moment who is boxing a ten round
 i can safely risk five dollars on him contest in town on the 7 th of next month he has
 finished on his little farm and is against any average light weight on the night of his fight just waiting
 for his crops to ripen so is putting in time and making a little money working here we are used
 the mosquitoes are a terrible plague every night as chopping blocks punch we have to cover our doors and wining
 bags and sparring partners he is dows with butter muslin at nights and a powerful little beast and to go
 one after we are shut in for the night get round with him entails being knocked to work with a
 little tin sprayer and partially senseless for any of the men of some stuff called flytox which smells his weight
 i m just big enough to be very vile but at least permits you to awkward for him to handle
 so i get sleep more or less in peace plenty of it sometimes three two minute rounds a night tonight
 my lip is split another uneventful week has gone but i have the satisfaction of knowing by but in it
 i have done a great many that he sprained a thumb on me he is things all different we had
 a wet bebeing trained by one of the irrigators ginning to the week so couldn t hay whose ring name
 is sailor pat burke a i ve been ploughing in ditches irrigathird rate rough houser but a very ef tion
 in one of the wheat fields so that ficient little trainer who orders us the binder can cross them again
 a sparring partners about like so many british farmer would have had apoplexy dogs the gloves are even taken out
 to if he d seen us rollicking around with the hayfield and we work during the two teams in the
 ripening wheat to lunch hour skipping running and say nothing of the wheeled plough and sparring personally i like to
 sleep on the spike harrow 17 another profitable morning i spent shut up at night there was even a with
 huge stakes boards seven inch slight frost the other night nails and a sledge hammer constructing a beautiful spillway out
 of the dam so i haven t made up my mind about that the water is banked up a bit
 in the winter yet i don t think even saving the loch but is coming through down hard i can
 get enough money to do the creek just the same my work is college really comfortably so i don t
 effective though unbeautiful and i think i shall do it at all but just stop used so many nails that
 joe said he d on in my job here for the winter and have to take some money off my
 july see how things are carried on through pay roll i ended by dropping the freeze up such as keeping
 the water sledge into the water and had to take open for stock carrying grain to the off my bags
 to get it then the after elevators in town and carting hay out ncon of that day i spent with
 the estim on to the range for the horses incidentable and never to be too much belauded ally there are
 lots of things to shoot joe in the barns paring horses feet and hunt and joe doesn t mind lending
 they are none of them shod through me his armoury when i want it the spring and summer so their
 feet grow long and crack and have to be we are getting raised next month to pared and rasped back
 into shape again xty five dollars to meet harvest wages this we did all over canada so that will be
 more money to put in my sock there s not now we are back again at haying much there yet
 but it s none so dusty and working away for dear life we for a short time haven t nearly
 finished the first crop yet and the second crop is ready to tonight while returning from swimcut where we started
 and getting ming we had an adventure we were ranker every day chased by a she weasel we interrupted her
 as she was carrying a baby some had a trying afternoon with a re where else and she dropped her
 child fractory dump rake which sometimes and charged us being prudent young wouldn t dump and at other times fellows
 and unarmed at that we dug wouldn t stop dumping i succeeded in out for home at the same time
 taking finishing the field and just then joe off our hats to mrs weasel who mcicame along the two of
 us struggled dentally turns to ermine in the winter with the thing for about an hour and and is worth
 four dollars a skin without any result it was as bad as ever so joe rose up and said give
 aug 3 1925 nothing of vital import me those lines he jumped up on the has happened to me mowers
 and rake and drove across an irrigation binders both going strong together we ditch at a trot after which he
 arose are nearly half way through the second from the ruins and in some satisfaction hay crop and the binders
 are well into remarked now they ll have to buy the wheat the oats of course will not us a
 new one be ready for a bit yet joe has i think at last realized how very important i some
 time ago we cut off a wild am to the welfare of the farm and duck s head on her
 nest with the mower the canadian land co generally he so we brought the eggs home and put has promoted
 me to first mower at them under a hen and hatched out nine seventy bucks a month which means out
 of fourteen and they are swimming that i have to cut into the field about tame as you please the
 place first going round the irrigation ditches is swimming with ducks thousands of and then turn and come back in
 my them and the young ones are just tracks cutting a back swathe none too getting on the wing preparatory
 to easy when one wheel is on the ditch going south for the winter we hear bank and the mower
 is kicking like a coyotes singing at night now so that horse you ve got to watch your sickle means
 that their cubs are starting to and lift or lower it as the bumps come hunt and the hens have
 to be carefully and keep the horses straight without a 18 ciouds of dust rose into the air to choke
 the driver levelling the land this man operates a five horse outfit cut swathe to guide you further to thomas
 of whom i told you won that he says he s got a binder for me his fight in the
 third round with a punch when haying is through which means that travelled from the floor or some six horses
 and a very much more com place and must have been doing eighty plicated piece of machinery then when miles
 an hour when it landed right on they start threshing i m to get a grain the mark the other
 poor lad closed up hauling job with four horses in hand like a jack knife with a horrid hiccup on
 a grain tank two trips into town and lay twitching and grunting an every day to the grain elevator for
 enthusiastic lady at the back it was an that they are going to pay six dollars open air show bawled
 out stop the a day roughly 25 s not bad when i fight stop the fight billie in his corner
 was getting 16 s in the army bawled back well that s what i done ain t it today i
 ve been on what is called a slip really it s a horse shovel and brooks fair and stampede is
 coming not a chemise two horses pull it along off on the 7 th and 8 th of next month
 the ground and a man at the handles and we are to get in free if we ll help tilts
 it so that it digs into the ground out the chutes saddling outlaws and and scoops up a great slice
 when it running in the steers and calves will is full he leans his weight on the i we have
 a puncher from n dakota handles and the edge comes up and skinning here and he is going to ride
 the team drags it away to the dumps he s very keen that i should too and in this way
 ditches and things are made will lend me the outfit i have con if however the gentleman on the sented
 provisionally the provision being handles digs his edge in too deep the that i don t get cold feet in
 the meanhandles fly up and the thing turns over time we have been practising on a wrenching the insides nearly
 out of the bunch of thomas some evenings and man holding her down when you are i must admit that
 while i can ride working the slip and driving the team straight bucking and scratch away at as well you
 ve got a job on hand that s shoulder and flanks wave my hat and what three of us were
 doing this after shout yippee like a little man as soon noon as he takes to a disgusting habit called
 19 weaving i become piled instantly this on pulling out to let the others past affords much amusement which i
 have while i did repairs temper was very had to limit to a nightly allowance of very thin towards the
 end and a b ue four falls or spots before the eyes after haze was hanging over me four falls
 or as soon as spots appear last saturday when i was in town before my eyes i quit after the
 spots with the rest i went down to the station my nose bleeds and i don t like that to
 see the trans canada come in and here has occurred a pause of 24 get any mail that came in
 for the farm hours owing to sleep overtaking me when she caine in there was an american girl sitting in
 the window of a have spent my first day on a binder pullman and she looked us all over a
 pretty grim day too the binder squatting on our heels and leaning was the oldest thing in its line on
 the against things and she called to someplace and just about dropping to pieces one oh say ernie she pronounced
 it needles kept coming unthreaded knot oinie come look at all the hicks supter failed to knot sickle kept plugging
 porting the deepot gordon and ole up and ended by breaking and the our punchers were also there in their
 canvases which revolve on rollers and very brightest neck handkerchiefs and carry the cut stuff up to the packers largest
 hats and were deeply wounded and knotter were slack and refused to if i m in town i always like
 to go down revolve i was black oil from top to to the station and see the trains und toe
 by supper time the horses had people go through you never know done nothing all day and i had to
 keep you might see somebody you know lethbridge in 1890 lethbridge is an interesting place to visit the old and
 the new life of the plains are strangely intermixed amidst the bustle and noise of the collieries and railway works
 the bull teams from fort macleod wind their way slowly into town while the stalwart blood indians with their painted
 faces and dress bedecked with beads and brass lounge dreamily around as if mystified with the clatter and clamour of
 civilization the daring cowboys whites mexicans and half breeds a picturesque lot with their sombreros leather leggings and flying neck
 scarfs dash up and down the streets on spirited broncos and now comes a string of mormon wagons canvas covered
 straggling across the river reminding one of the old emigrant days when wagons were the only means of transport across
 the plains and to cap the strange medley the stage coach a genuine stage coach drawn by four horses managed
 by a reckless swearing driver dashes into town with a flourish that almost takes one s breath away these things
 give a pleasant zest of life in the thriving town but the old things must give way before the vigorous
 march of the new away to the west the giant peaks of the rocky mountains mark the narrowing limits of
 the former and by the end of another decade the bull teams and the stage coach will have fulfilled their
 destiny and be laid aside the noble indian will have learned to work and the cowboy will have degenerated into
 a commonplace herdsman the land will be filled with civilized industries and all else will have passed into history winnipeg
 free press christmas l 890 20 the beginning of leslieville by mary c bailey on the 4 th of may
 1903 alex thompson his son george and george bailey left wisconsin for western canada enthused by literature obtained at a
 country fair describing all the advantages of this new country and with some ideas as to a western move already
 in their minds they finally agreed on red deer as their choice of possible location and arrived at that place
 on may 7 th from there they went westward against the advice of some well wishers who earnestly endeavored to
 show them the superior advantages of the land to the east of red deer after a three day trip by
 team and democrat with a driver and a land guide they returned and filed on three quarters of section 30
 township 39 range 4 west of the 5 th meridian some 40 miles from red deer which was to be
 for a time the site of their first post office and trading place red deer was not very big in
 those on consulting their cornerstakes that days roads were trails good in dry they had made their camp on the
 east weather almost impassable during side of george bailey s quarter half rainy spells people forded the streams a mile
 from their building site neverand rivers there was no towns of theless they began cutting logs for a sylvan lake
 benalto eckville condor 14 foot by 20 foot house hewing them or leslieville only a big beautiful land on both
 sides to a uniform thickness of unspoiled by civilization waiting for five inches as the wood was of poplar some
 hardy folk to come and make use and balm fairly soft and easily cut the of it there was water
 and abundant work progressed rapidly this task acpasture for stock and fertile soil to complished their next problem was how
 produce food for all who possessed to get the logs to the spot where the health ambition and necessary know
 house was to be built as they had no how to utilize these natural assets the horses three pioneers saw
 the possibilities in this area they had chosen for their future right there nature stepped in and homes and never
 had occasion to regret gave them something else to think about their choice they awoke one morning to find the
 ground covered with snow and more on the 13 th of may they arrived coming down every minute if these
 and took possession of their new home new settlers suffered a little from cold steads bringing with them their trunks
 feet at this juncture they probably had a small tent camp equipment a good some justification it snowed for three
 supply of food two rifles and a shotgun days and then froze over hard when and a small amount of
 lumber then they awoke the next morning they found they said good bye to the teamster who a crust on
 top of the snow that would had brought them and their stuff out bear their weight and their hauling and
 were on their own problem was solved necessity they the first house was to be built on say is the
 mother of invention so mr thompson s quarter as he had a out of their necessity they evolved a family
 to consider then they discovered plan they cut a strong pole a few feet mrs george w bailey is a
 daughter of alex thompson and writes of leslieville s beginnings from first hand experience leslieville is about 35 miles west
 of red deer mrs bailey now lives at 4601 49 th street red deer 21 the second house in the
 leslieville area was built by george w bailey here the author and her family are seen in front of the
 house in about 1908 long and tied one end of a stout rope to but during the early summer of
 1903 a the middle of it the other end they store was started and post office estabfastened to the end
 of each of the hewn lished at a spot some 20 miles west of logs in turn then with george
 bailey red deer and evarts was born neveron one side of the rope and george theless it was a long
 day s walk to thompson on the other and both push evarts and back for a load of groceries ing
 mightily against the pole all of the logs were hauled over the crusted snow that first early summer brought two
 to the building site as one old timer families for neighbors albert young said that was thompson s first team
 his wife and brother walter drove up from dakota and located two miles to the house was soon finished the
 the east they brought horses cattle cracks chinked and plastered the roof and two gaunt hounds and built a which
 was made of slender poles shack beside the blueberry creek where covered first with dry grass then with withrow is
 now a mile south of them dirt served admirably in fine weather four english brothers named davies but became a
 dismal spectacle when with their mother and the wives and the rainy season set in baby daughters of two of
 them located south of the horseguard river as they next came the bedrooms one 10 feet by 12 feet built
 on the west end were quite inexperienced in such work of the house the other 7 feet by 9 feet
 the thompson outfit was able to help them with their building on the north side for the use of the
 remaining members of the family who during that same summer george were still in wisconsin bailey built a 12 foot
 by 16 foot log shack on his own quarter section which thus was built the first house in the became
 the home of the first bride in leslieville district it served during the the district 1904 and also of the
 first first early years as stopping place for child 1905 new settlers and a mail centre for people farther west
 and north at first in july of 1903 mr thompson re red deer was the nearest post office turned to
 wisconsin sold his posses 22 sions there and brought his wife his other settlers soon began to make two daughters
 and 6 year old son to their appearance about march of 1905 their new home in alberta lovely john reilly
 and his family consisting weather the profusion of wild flowers of his wife and four daughters and two everywhere and
 the birds greeted them sons arrived and built a house only a there were also bulldogs coyotes and mile away
 making them the thompson mosquitoes we soon learned that family s nearest neighbcrs on the south bulldogs were only horseflies
 and towards fall cf that year a frenchman coyotes in spite of their blood curdling named edmund bureau took up
 land a howls were really cowards and quite harmless as for the mosquitoes they mile or so to the west
 and begun to were a well known pest and could be make plans for a store building which smudged out
 a few things we did was completed in the summer of 1906 miss however included the old familiar sounds of
 dogs barking cattle baw ing the country was filling up rapidly the tinkle of bells and the whinnying of now

 back a feat which was successfully accomplished notwithstanding a serious obstacle which was encountered a few miles out of lethbridge
 in the shape of a big slough which was impassable chauffer grasswick succeeded in running the car up the railway
 embankment and by straddling the rails he got around the slough this distance by trail from lethbridge to medicine hat

 my two companions and i left edmonton about july 1 st 1910 to look for ranching land along the peace
 river the names of my two friends were s r kipp of wilkie and c w latimer of wolfe sask
 we purchased a team of horses a camping outfit and a buckboard at an auction sale then we started for
 athabasca landing which was ninety miles north edmonton was the jumping off place as it was the railway point furthest
 north west at that time we made athabasca in two days in this village were some of the most beautiful
 flower gardens i had ever seen a lot of vegetables were also grown a large amount of freight was shipped
 from here at that time and scows large wooden boats were built here and loaded for the mackenzie river district
 the scows did not return but were broken up so the lumber in them could be used the freight for
 peace river was taken by steamer to mirror landing across the river from smith there is fifteen miles of rapids
 on the lesser slave river which had to be portaged and the goods were loaded on another northern transportation boat
 for grouard we crossed the athabasca river on the cable ferry and followed the federal telegraph line all the way
 to grouard the roads between athabasca land bridges had been built over the small ing and mirror landing were very
 bad rivers sawridge had a trading post they were composed mostly of muskeg warehouse and a couple of residents in
 fact there was no grade just a trail the lack of a bridge or ferry made it cut through the
 spruce swamp many necessary for us to swim our stock across a horse died of foot rot being in the
 the lesser slave river in our outfit swamp too long at a time about twenty we had five head of
 horses and two rigs miles north of athabasca landing lived an old cree indian called jacknife who we had an
 indian david st albert had gone up there during the riel rebel who had joined us at athabasca he lion
 in 1885 his house was made of was quite helpful with both the other logs i stopped there one night
 while indians and fording rivers we also paddling down the river from sawridge swam several head of cattle belonging to
 athabasca he would not accept to some local indians across with our money but wanted food as payment for own
 herd my lodging in crossing deep rivers we always at mirror landing the northern took the harness off the horses
 before transportation co had a man looking trying to swim them we had to be sure to take the harness
 across first so we after their business there his name was could use it if the horses got stuck if
 charlie hutton and it was his job to there was no boat or canoe available transfer the freight over the
 portage we would build a raft to float the rigs the wagon road was fair from mirror across there was
 a small creek on the landing to sawridge because consider south side of lesser slave lake not far able grading
 had been done many from sawridge which had a very soft this article was obtained through the courtesy of george
 stephenson box 148 mclennan the assistance of the author mr carrothers and miss brawshaw who helped ‘ il n prepare
 the article are gratefully acknowledged 24 bottom and we had to pull out every 1910 and it was mostly through
 brush horse we had all the rivers were bridged the government built a grade about six or eight there was
 no sign of a road between miles long across buffalo bay in 1910 sawridge and swan river a trail was
 the bay was dry at this time with a cut out for the telegraph line but they heavy growth of
 grass about three feet left the stumps so high the axles of our high a settler took land about the
 wagon would not go over them we had centre of it and built a fair frame house to circle the
 lake for a few miles mostly to the windows when the water came in one or two feet of water
 as the spruce back he was three or four miles from bush was fairly heavy land the graded road was
 also under we had to ford swan river as there water was no bridge at that time only a i
 had a pamphlet printed in edmonwagon trail to grouard a mr hunt and ton during 1909 or 1910 that said
 lesser his family farmed there after moving slave lake was slowly but surely drying from north dakota up the indians
 did not believe it they there was a small river between said the white man did not know lesser swan
 river and driftpile that was very slave lake soft on the bottom so we decided to float our outfit across
 on a raft made david st albert told me that years of logs a lot of indians had settled at
 before a white man had built a trading driftpile and did considerable fishing post on the shore of the lake
 david here the whitefish were plentiful and tried to advise him to build on higher of large fat quality the
 indians fished ground but the trader would not do this late in the fall after the flies disappeared as he
 said it was too far from water so they could dry the fish for winter use two years later when
 st albert was they would build a structure of logs passing that way he paddled his canoe into the store
 alongside the counter and about twelve feet square and four feet loaded his supplies into the canoe the high and
 put across logs three feet trader could use only the top shelves in apart then they got small willows the
 store the anglican mission was on about one inch thick sharpened on end and shoved them through the tails of
 high ground on the north west side of buffalo bay the catholic mission at the fish they put six fish
 on one willow grouard also had a mission school and placed this on the cross logs the fish hanging heads
 down when this english and cocklin two pioneers twelve foot square became filled they of spirit river left a steam
 boiler there would build another square four feet for the next freeze up they were high on top and fill
 it this would con stranded when the winter road broke tinue until they had two or three tiers up in
 the spring of 1910 the boiler then they would start another square was hauled four hundred and seventythe same way
 the fish cured well for five miles from the railhead at edmonton winter use for a sawmill machinery and supplies
 grouard was the largest settlement had to come in over winter roads the beyond athabasca in 1910 the three same
 way stores were the hudson s bay the there was mostly bush on the road barney morris and the revillon
 freres to peace river except at little prairie there w a s a mission a hospital which was a nice
 little prairie about r n w m p dominion land office a twenty five miles from peace river no blacksmith
 a post office and a boat white people had settled here in 1910 landing in low water the boat could
 but the indian stopping places were not travel further than shaw s point used by winter freighters peace river eight
 miles east when the lake was crossing as it was called in those days high the boat could come to
 the hudson s was not a very populated town there bay store on buffalo bay were two stores a mounted
 police bar there was a fair wagon road from racks and a lodging house there were grouard to peace river
 we crossed in no licensed hotels beyond athabasca as 25 the carrothers party is seen here on its first trip
 into the peace river district in 1910 the photo was taken on the trail north of fort assiniboine liquor was
 not allowed in any of this power we left the river there headed country west toward dunvegan and camped on
 top of a hill where a montana family j k cornwall of edmonton who was was camping they had a
 herd of five a great booster for this northern country horses which were dying with foot rot after the turn
 of the century had some american newsmen with him here at from being in the muskeg for too long at
 a time the sand flies were very bad this time i was talking to one of the so we kept
 our horses covered head men in the lodging house he didn t ears and all with a cotton cover think
 the peace river country would ever be settled in our time or that they would build a railroad into peace
 river this area north of the peace was because they couldn t get down the hill open country with small
 patches of to cross the river the ed and b c poplar the only water west of burnt railway wasn
 t heard of at that time river near the trail was in a deep ravine which was called the waterhole
 we crossed the peace river on a this is how the settlement got its name cable ferry there were no
 buildings on some of the nicest country we saw here the west side at this time we went was mostly
 open prairie they were south along the river through the surveying the district between brick s shaftesbury settlement past the
 angli and dunvegan in the summer of 1910 can mission to the allie brick residence at this time he was

 can missionary allie brick had a thresh hardly any buildings there except a ing separator and did some threshing for
 hudson s bay post an anglican church himself and the settlement i didn t see a mission house and also
 a man who any engine so i presume he used horse operated the local ferry 26 the next stop was
 spirit river the the way we had to travel along the first half of the road was fairly heavily river
 bottom which luckily was dry in wooded with the last half being open a half day we came to the
 old trail to prairie at spirit river bill english and fort assiniboine this trail was cut out his partner cocklin
 were located bill and improved at the time of the klon english came into this country with the dike gold
 rush i was told they intended klondike gold rush in 1898 and stayed to go through to the yukon but
 i don t there were quite a few people who tried think they got further than fort st john to
 get to the kiondike this way from or possibly fort nelson at that time it edmonton and bill liked to
 tell stories was a fairly good wagon road over the about them english and cocklin did swan hills when it
 was put in but a little oats farming i didn t see any it was never kept in repair other
 grain fields that year this trail did not go down into swan there was a wagon road from spirit valley
 but went west on the high eleva river to grande prairie with fairly good tion it crossed the swan and
 driftpile light brush all the way we didn t see rivers at their head waters in the swan any settlers
 or indians there is a high hills there were no settlers to fort elevation about half way up the road
 assiniboine but a few trappers stopped at the highest point we had our first in the winter time look at
 the rocky mountains in the distance on the second day we arrived there was a ferry on the athabasca at
 twin lakes now called clairmont line here a young englishman called lakes there was plenty of waterfowl holmes had settled
 where the old hudthere we saw swans geese and an son s bay post was at one time the first
 abundance of ducks on the lakes a few part of the road to edmonton had about homesteaders had settled in
 this area thirty miles of fairly heavy bush and some good white spruce the wagon after breaking camp we went
 to road was fairly good our last fifty where grande prairie is now there miles into edmonton was through setwere
 two small log buildings one being tled country a restaurant and the other a blacksmith shop they were both operated
 by the in 1911 we made another trip to the same man a mr bredin also the only peace river
 area this time mostly by resident he said he had two aprons water the passenger train went as fur a
 white one for the restaurant and a west as edson at this time the land leather one for the blacksmith
 shop around there wasn t very good mostly we had dinner in the restaurant which covered with black spruce and
 muskeg was good for such an out of the way we rode a construction train to the end place i
 don t know how he was in the of the steel at hinton after purchasing blacksmith shop as we didn
 t have any some lumber we built a boat and started thing to try on him down the athabasca river
 to mirror we went from there to flying shot landing the first part of the river from lake which is
 about eight miles away hinton was good for travelling but there was a trading post here run by where the
 river runs almost due north mr clifford and his wife they were there are high rock banks right from the
 both originally from north dakota mrs water s edge inland sharp bends that clifford was a school teacher before she

 inches of ice on miles east and one on the west side the muskeg and two to four inches of
 of the peace river also on the west wet snow on top so we could not see side of the
 river was a fair sized village what we were driving into our horses i went up the peace to dunvegan
 on legs were skinned when we broke the ice there were no new buildings through the frost so we left
 our wagon here and load and headed to the settlement to get food for our horses grouard was i continued

 donald mcleod one of the most widely known of the old timers of edmonton was born in the village of
 shabost parish of callway in the island of lewes the largest of the hebrides he served four years in the
 naval reserve before leaving scotland and came to canada in 1862 in the service of the hudson s bay company
 he was stationed at fort canton for the first three years then at edmonton for two years and for two
 years at rocky mountain house he left the service of the company in 1869 and came to edmonton in the
 spring of 1870 he began trading on his own account in 1871 took up as a claim what is now
 river lot 14 in the town of edmonton and in 1872 he built one of the first houses in the
 present town he soon afterwards gave up trading and began freighting on a large scale during the years from 1875
 to 1883 mr mcleod had the largest freighting outfit on the road between winnipeg and edmonton when the railway reached
 calgary in 1883 the freighting business began to decline and mr macleod divided his attention amongst other matters he speculated
 in real estate and timber limits established a ranch at the black mud crossing of the calgary trail took a
 hand at railway contracting when the c e railway was being built and in all respects led a most active
 business life he was one of the original promoters and owners of the saw and grist mills in edmonton in
 1880 in conjunction with messrs john norris of edmonton and inspector belcher of regina he built these mills when winnipeg
 was the nearest railway point and when gladstone manitoba was the limit of the nearest agricultural settlements to the eastward
 mr mcleod was also the first to commence the shipment of coal from the mines on the white mud to
 calgary a trade that is increasing to very large proportions edmonton bulletin nov 26 1894 29 mdt s anid ctd
