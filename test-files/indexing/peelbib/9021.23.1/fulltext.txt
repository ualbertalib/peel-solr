 ‘ of louis riel thomas flanagan in the mind of louis rid the north west rebellion was as much a
 religious movement as a political uprising it gave him the opportunity to present to the world a unique personal religion
 which he had created ten years earlier since 1875 when he first began to receive communications from god rid had
 been convinced that he was the prophet of the new world with a special mission to carry out in the
 tragic events of 1885 he tried to turn his dream into reality the religious aspect of rid s aims in

 as a series of utterances by various he deemed these too radical for his followclergymen by far the most important

 is never intended by the pious and orthodox contrary to divine mercy and to the charity bishop of jesus christ

 an anticipation of clifford sifton s who quite naturally opposed his mission famous policy it should be pointed out that
 he had no choice but to hear confessions riel had in mind a gigantic influx of whole and give absolution
 himself so that the peoples not immigration in the normal métis 0:metis could be shriven before going into sense battle armed
 with his visions and his teaching however these fine points of doctrine riel expected to triumph by divine assisand worship
 were not as important to riel tance on the rebel flag he attached a holy as his vision of a
 massive immigration of picture of our lady of lourdes on the catholic peoples to the north west while back of
 which he wrote a poem if there in the united states he had been impressed could be miracles at lourdes

 later said tion from traditional catholic materials i yielded to riel s judgment although i but the same messianic impulse
 has taken was convinced that from a human stand other forms in other situations another point mine was the better
 plan but i had messianic cult which arose on the american confidence in his faith and his prayers and prairies
 at about the same time was the that god would listen to him 5 when ghost dance begun by the
 paiute wovoka dumont finally did engage middleton at which swept through the plains indians fish creek riel was back at
 batoche lead like rid the medicine men promised saling those who were with him in prayer vation to a conquered
 people but in a while they knelt he extended his arms in different way their vision was of the rethe
 form of a cross he repeated this pos turn of the buffalo and the expulsion of ture at the final
 battle of batoche a path the white man when the indian would etic incident reveals how riel s faith per
 again be master of his own life it was a sisted to the end as the story was later pagan
 hope not a catholic but recogniztold ably similar in inspiration to riel s half an hour before the surrender of
 the comparative literature of messianism batoche patrice tourond said to riel does more than point out analogies to riel s
 ‘ do your miracle nowit s time riel sank to his knees lifted his arms in prophetic religion it also
 can help one to the form of a cross and began to pray understand the course of rid s behaviour
 then he spoke ‘ all together let us after his capture the fundamental quessay three times very loudly ‘ my
 god tion here is the failure of prophecy riel have pity on us everyone dropped to his knees and repeated
 the prayer genuinely believed that god would inter then riel continued ‘ my godstop vene on the battlefield of batoche
 how did those people crush them and the he react to the failure of divine help to miracle did not
 happen riel called materialize did he simply give up his betwo men to hold his arms up 6 lief in
 his mission once the evidence seem but in spite of these exertions god did not ed negative give riel victory
 at batoche a now classic study by a team of amen these facts about riel s prophetic career can social
 psychologists has been devoted mean that he is of interest not only to to a specific instance of such a
 problem s canadian history but to another academic early in the 1950 s a housewife in a city field the
 study of messiahs and messianic in the mid west began to predict an immimovements this field is not a single

 superior eral subjects theologians historians 5 oc o beings who had travelled to the earth on logists and anthropologists have
 all con flying saucers she attracted a small group tributed to the growing literature on mess of human believers to
 whom she promised ianic behaviour that the extra terrestrial beings would save drawing on these comparative studies them in the
 nick of time to make a long one can put louis riel s religion into the story short a day
 was predicted for the proper framework 7 it was a message of great event the group assembled and waithope to
 a people thrust aside by the march ed for deliverance and nothing happened of civilization if the worldly future of
 the then what did the group simply bow to métis 0:metis was not bright at least they could the evidence not

 providing a home for the pon ment and who had infiltrated it with their tiff of the new world their

 to redress to spread her predictions previously in 4 this ra re photo shows riel as a prisoner outside the
 guard tent in the dying days of the rebellion fact she had been rather secretive and had has a psychological
 alternative to changing not really welcomed publicity now for a his conviction if he can convince large few days she
 went all out to make converts numbers of people that the negative cvi ultimately the cult proved to be too
 bizarre dence can be explained away and if he to make much headway but the fact re can convert them
 to his cause the cognimains the major attempt to prosyletize fol tive dissonance vanishes as surely as and lowed and
 did not precede the appearance less painlessly than if the believer gave up of negative evidence the theory in which
 he has invested so how were the psychologists able to make much commitment the correct prediction by argument from while
 admittedly events of this type the theory of cognitive dissonance shorn arc not perfectly replicable still this apof technical terminology
 this theory states proach niay be applied to louis riel it that men do not like their beliefs to be
 leads one to expect that after his check out of joint with the peroefved evidence at batoche riel might well
 have gone on a good scientist resolves this disparity by to try to obtain a wider audience for his altering
 his beliefs to fit the facts but n new religion this is in fact what happened men are not scientists
 and they would just from the time of his voluntary surrender as soon alter the data as their opinions on
 may 15 1885 till he received his death furthermore it must be remembered that sentence from judge richardson on augevidence
 or facts are the result of social ust 1 riel redoubled his evangelistic efforts agreement before copernicus it was a
 fact the rebel forces at batoche had been to almost everyone that the sun revolved dispersed on may 12 and
 rid like many around the earth thus the true believer others had fled he could probably have when confronted with
 unpalatable evidence escaped to the united states as did gabriel 5 dumont but rid voluntarily surrendered tures of the saints
 and pious prayers which having received a note from general mid were in currency in the catholic church dleton riel
 wrote back that he would hand he suggested three sample inscriptions of himself over i will go to fulfill god
 s will which one is given below he wrote in a revealing sentence he had 1 st inscription i respect
 the bishop apparently already rationalized the defeat of rome and i pray for him but i have nothing to do
 with him any more at batoche into a larger scheme of things allegiance to himi think means in which his
 mission would enter a new constant division and endless strugphase gles with the other christian denominations at the same time

 s belief letize rid gave the reverend pitblado an that rome had become a godless city explanation of his teaching
 which was ob of merchants riel was addicted to puns like this both in french and viously designed for protestant
 ears the english main doctrines were summarized under eight headings that the true church is com this scheme through which
 rid also hopposed of all true christian believers that ed to earn a little money for the support the pope
 is not infallible that every man of his family got no farther presumably has the right of private interpretation of
 because of opposition from the authonities the scriptures that there should be an or but it does illustrate rid s
 desire to spread dained ministry to which most protestant his opinions to the world clergymen could belong that church gov
 cut off from wide use of the printed ernment should be episcopal with a head word although he was interviewed
 by bishop in the new world independent of newspaper reporters rid turned his en rome that there is only one
 god and no ergy to composing a series of letters which trinity in the conventional sense that men can only
 be described as extraordinary should pray to god to christ to mary to on june 24 he wrote to edgar
 dewdney the saints that all men will ultimately be lieut governor of the north west 13 to saved 10 this
 exposition moved captain demand a trial before the supreme court george young chief of the military escort of canada he
 asked furthermore to be to remark later that rid seemed to be tried on his whole career from the rebel
 unitarian in his belief and possibly was lion of 1869 and the murder of thomas making a strong bid for
 the support and scott to the latest events in the saskatcheprotection of the ultra protestants rid wan rid also requested
 that he be reprehad never said anything like this before sented by five lawyers a french canaclearly he modified his
 religion to be suit dian liberal a french canadian conservaable not for the métis 0:metis who are not even tive an
 irish liberal and an irish conmentioned in his eight articles but for the servative with an english protestant lawwhite protestant
 population yer who speaks french well and who enjoys once in prison riel tried to use what the confidence of
 the conservative party ever means were available to spread his and in particular of sir john a macdoncreed early in
 june he sent a note to aid in conclusion rid suggested that the captain r burton deane 2 commander of
 conservative party had always been his the regina detachment and thus respons true friend and that the liberals of upper
 ible for the gaol requesting permission to canada were his real enemies have a photographer come to take pictures three
 days later rid wrote to dewdney of him for instance one sitting in my again 14 suggesting that his trial
 be held in cell a second one while i take exercise quebec where the population was more au the chains
 on and between the two sentries fait with the facts of his career with a fair a third one while
 i pray on my knees trial rid wrote he was sure he would be to these pictures rid wanted to
 attach exonerated and the conservative party inscriptions like the holy cards bearing pie would triumph with him the wisdom of
 sir john s policy in 1870 would be vindi when this example of co operation between cated in conclusion rid
 wrote great and small reached the imperial parlia i have just done an extraordinary ment it would show how to
 resolve the thing i well knowin causing the irish question in a similar way it would metis of the saskatchewan
 to separate also perhaps lead to foundation of the great from rome but when the whole imperial union described in
 the letter of conservative party sees for itself that my political conduct is well balanced july 6 perhaps they will
 not be the last to the last of this remarkable series of letsympathize with what i have done ters was
 written on july 24 and addressed and even to help as much as they can if circumstances permit all the
 metis to archbishop taché 0:tache rid s erstwhile patto separate from rome with the as ron and protector 17 in this
 long missive sent of the clergy rid explained the reason for his break if these letters with their desire to
 turn from rome he also informed taché 0:tache that a treason trial into a public forum and their god had selected
 him taché 0:tache to be the attempt to gain the support of the conserva second pope of the new world succeeding
 tives against whom rid had just led a bishop bourget who had passed away in rebellion show a certain detachment
 from june of 1885 today i proclaim reality what can be said of the following humbly from the padlocked compound
 of letter which rid addressed to sir john a regina prison that you are the pontiff macdonald on july 6
 15 what did sir john chosen by god to instruct console succor think when he received eighteen large pages guide
 bless and save the new world proposing among other things an imperial through the grace of jesus christ union of
 britain and her dominions to even as rid wrote these words his trial gether with the united states this realm
 was drawing near in the last few days of attaining thus the apogee of a glory that july he finally
 had his chance to make his no human empire has yet attained would case to the world it was clear
 that he had break with rome and establish its own re little interest in the actual legal issues of ligion
 in a thinly veiled allusion to him the trial he refused to co operate with the self riel wrote that
 this union would choose plea of insanity made by his defence law some person known by his profound wis yers
 which was his only realistic chance dom by his virtue by his knowledge and of escaping the hangman obviously he
 large intelligence who would have the task viewed the court as a forum for the presenof promoting the most perfect
 harmony tation of his entire career his mission between the different christian beliefs by when it came time to speak
 on his own one colossal domination while communi behalf rid devoted himself chiefly to sketeating this world emnbracing fantasy rid
 ching the history of his mission to describalso warned the prime minister that gab ing the signs he had received
 from god rid dumont now a refugee in the united through bishop bourget and other clergy states would soon mobilize
 the french men rid speeches were a defence canadians irish jews bavarians italians against the charge of his own attorneys
 pole scandinavians and germans of am that he was insane for insanity would mean erica to invade and dismember canada
 the his mission was meaningless in rid s mind only way to prevent this apocalyptic voel this trial was his
 great opportunity to cxkerwanderung was to grant rid and the plain his mission to the world at large 1 other
 prisoners better treatment and a fair his strategy was unsuccessful he was trial but the conservatives should have found guilty
 of treason by the jury and nothing to fear from a fair trial for it sentenced by the judge to
 hang now hope would show that the liberals were the real cannot persist forever unchanged in the villains face of
 contrary experience the prophet on july 16 rid wrote again to the prime sooner or later must either give up
 alto minister to add another proposal after gether or else revise his prediction in an vindication at a trial before
 the supreme appropriate way in the flying saucer in court rid could become prime minister cident mentioned earlier the devotees
 of manitoba he would then negotiate bet were able to keep up and even redouble icr terms with the dominion
 government their enthusiasm for some days after the 7 saucers failed to materialize but ultimately once the text was prepared
 rid wrote they melted away from the prophetess and again at much greater length to fathers she moved on to
 scientology rid was able fourmond and cochin 2 recounting the to keep his hope alive after the check at history
 of his mission in considerable detail batoche and even attempted to spread his he said the retraction was opposed on
 a gospel to the world but his conviction and great number of points to what the spirit sentence of execution
 provided a powerful had revealed to him but that he would sign shock superficially it appears that rid was because
 i want to have the help of the jolted into renouncing his mission entirely sacraments of the church in which
 i have for on august 5 he signed an abjuration every confidence and of which i have great prepared by
 father fourmond o m i in need rid added furthermore that if his which he denounced his false mission as
 confession was to be published he wanted the first cause of my errors 1 however the present letter attached to
 it together a closer inspection of the documentary cvi with the following prayer my god if dence shows that the
 abjuration was not a you wish if you have decreed in your total renunciation but rather the occasion eternal plans
 resurrect oliver p morton for a prophetic reinterpretation on rid s as he was and then heal him so that
 he part mnay aid us in the united states this two days after receiving his sentence prayer hearkens back to
 1875 to the ear rid wrote to father fourmond to request liest days of rid s mission while in washhim
 to draw up the formula of abjuration ington he had sought help from morton obedience he wrote is the bread
 with the powerful republican senator from inwhich i should nourish myself and to obey diana as a result of a
 stroke morton had now in the matter of my retraction is certain been paralyzed from the waist down and ly
 the action which seems the most difficult rid proposed to heal him in return for of all you could have
 proposed 2 but support of his projects in the north west said rid since his mission had been an to
 make the arrangements more businessnounced by a bishop he would once again like rid offered to perform the miracle bow
 to an authorized priest as he had while kept as a prisoner in regina riel accepted his mission in obedience
 so would was permitted to exercise in front of his he renounce it jail house in installments after morton had
 done cer in short rid s emotions were mixed uptam things one leg would be healed and on signing the
 retraction he badly wanted after he had completed his part of the to rejoin the church and he redefined his
 bargain the other leg would regain its mission so as to make this possible he strength morton who was not
 impressed came to believe that his mission was as it subsequently died on november 1 1877 had always been to
 obey the voice of god while rid was in beauport asylum thus even if that meant publicly renouncing his the
 prayer to resurrect him in insisting mission rid had used a similar rationalthat his prayer and his letter be published
 ization years before to explain his confinealong with his abjuration rid certainly nient in a lunatic asylum he must do
 god s left room for doubt as to the way in which will even if that meant humiliation like he
 intended his recantation he seemed as jesus he must drain the chalice of suffermuch bent on publicizing his creed as
 on ing to the dregs this redefinition of his renouncing it mission in terms of obedience and suffering rid did
 sign the document drawn up was of crucial importance to rid because by father fourmond on august 5 hut it
 was the one course which enabled him again he prefixed to it a statement empha to retain his belief in
 himself even facing sizing his obedience rather than his ri the scaffold every defeat became an incerity tegral part of
 his mission of obedience and the religious principle which made suffering no longer could there be conme have so much
 confidence in the trary evidence every reverse every setword of archbishop bourget logically back was confirmation of the mission whose
 leads me to have the same confidence fulfilment even required the prophet s in the interpretation which the ap death
 proved priest my director of consciencegives me of the episcopal rid s biography in the three and a half word
 of archbishop ignace bourget of months which remained to him after conblessed memory renouncing then all viction is the story
 of his struggle to cornthe special interpretations that i have made of my mission which my con bine prophecy with
 obedience to prepare fessor and director does not approve himself for death while still hoping his life i re enter
 the bosom of the catholic might be spared on the one hand his apostolic and roman church 22 visionary experiences
 continued this is thus rid made it clear that he was not attested by father cochin almost immedigiving up the
 idea of his mission per se ately after the abjuration 2 yet rid was rather he was redefining it in
 terms of pathetically eager to adjust his revelations obedience to the clergy and renouncing his to catholic orthodoxy on august
 31 fathown right to make special interpretations er andré 0:andre wrote f x lemieux rid s at even this gesture clearly
 cost rid a great torney deal of inner turmoil he was afraid that he has retracted his errors but in
 obeying the clergy he might be disobey he believes himself to be a prophet and when i reprove him for
 his ing the voice of the holy spirit that spoke foolish and extravagant ideas he to him directl y he
 must have confided answers that he submits but that he these worries to father cochin for on cannot stifle the
 voice that speaks august 6 the day after rid affixed his in him and the spirit that commands him to
 communicate to the world the signature to his abjuration that priest wrote revelations he receives 25 to him to try
 to exorcise the demon of doubt his message was that rid need rid s diary shows that towards the end
 of have no qualms as long as he relied on the october he reformulated his doctrine of servants of the
 church the papacy to make it compatible with catholic teaching now the new world with reference to the responsibility would
 not need to break away from the that you fear to have incurred by making that abjuration you certainly nope
 instead leo xiii would come to do not incur it and i am so sure of montreal convoke an ecumenical
 council it that i do not fear to take it upon and name bishop taché 0:tache pontiff of the ammyself before
 god and man the proof ericas thus rome would not fall and the is that i helped to compose the
 abjuration and that i signed myself as amimericas would continue to honour her priest 23 primacy 20 it seems then
 that rid did his 9 best to purge all heretical and schismatic he can model his mission on the submission
 elements from his prophecies in his own of the founder and find meaning in apparway he was recognizing the failure
 of his ent failure what christian theologians call mission as he originally interpreted it he the scandal of the cross
 was at least partially coming to terms with thus prepared rid died more heroicreality ally than he had lived it
 fell to father an even more pressing reality was death andré 0:andre to tell him that his last appeal had rid
 had to prepare himself for this event been denied that november 16 was the uality and also to redefine his
 mission so irrevocable day rid took the news calmly that it would not be negated by his execu replying laetatus
 sum in his quae dicta tion should it come rid feared death and sunt mihi in domum domini ibimus 13
 felt it approaching he saw his remaining i have rejoiced in the things which have days flee more rapidly than
 the snows of been said to me we will go into the house montana under the consuming south west of
 the lord father andré 0:andre described his wind the burning chinook 27 but rid con last vigil with riel tinued to
 hope that his sentence would be i have never passed a happier commuted either by the courts or by cx
 and holier night he fuel was joyecutive clemency he filled page after page ful and all night i noticed no
 shadow with prayers for deliverance with medita of sadness on his face we prayed togetherand afterwards being seated tions on
 the terror of death and when he placed his head on my shoulder his hopes were high he believed that
 his and embraced me saying ‘ how happy words might still be heard again and again and content i am
 i feel my heart he prayed that his speeches to the court overflow with joy 33 might produce an immense
 effect 2 after hearing mass and taking communion he was prepared for life but he also for the last time
 rid walked bravely to had to prepare for death interspersed with his death he made no speech as father his
 prayers for deliverance and for success andré 0:andre had persuaded him to imitate the in his mission are prayers in another
 vein silent death of jesus he simply exchanged the acceptance of death acceptance was a few words with his confessor
 repeating part of obedience i have reentered he that he died willingly that he forgave his wrote the holy obedience
 of the catholic enemies amid thanked those who had helped apostolic and roman church the him in his last days
 he put the rope around logic of obedience is infinite like the will his own neck and from the scaffold

 dit je fixe ic jour de votre fin 30 was he did not simply go as a man to his
 if it was god s will wrote rid he would maker his sense of mission did not let rather die
 than return to see his family he him die with no more distinction than courwould offer his death as a
 sacrifice it would age in meeting man s common fate in his not destroy his mission but consummate it own
 mind his death had to mean more my god i offer you through jesus than that earlier in prison he
 had played christ my condemnation to death my with the idea that he might become a canimprisonment my chains the
