 interest in local and regional history was left in the hands of volunteers and studies were often encouraged through local
 historical societies the first of these was the ab literary scientific historical society ove formed in fort macleod in 1884

 of these was higinbotham 4 1 b c initially served the edmonton region who arrived in alberta in 1884 he
 was born in guelph and received his training prior to the i 920 s scholarship was at the ontario college
 of pharmacy in a i limited primarily to a few works of toronto he was always entranced by his o
 fiction by alberta authors such as ac grandfather s stories of pioneer life so garrioch nellie mcclung and w a
 when he was offered the position of 3 q fraser autobiographies by persons like manager of a pharmacy at the
 north cecil denny and t bland strange west mounted police post in fort political tracts and innumerable stacks macleod he
 quickly accepted he lived of promotional and immigration there for a year and then opened a drug literature among the
 few to write on an store in lethbridge he was also historical theme were john mcdougall lethbridge postmaster from 1886

 sunday school association of canada katherine hughes with the black robe voyageur lv kelly with higinbotham was a keen observer
 and the range men and a o mcrae s was fully conscious of the role that he history of alberta
 and others were playing in the opening of the west he interviewed mounted in the late 1920 s and early
 1930 s four policemen and whiskey traders who first people are notable in expressing a deep settled the area as
 well as homesteaders love for western canadian history both ranchers and women of the frontier the in their writings and
 public speaking only immediate outlet for his literary and these were john d higinbotham of historical talents was the press
 and he lethbridge j e a macleod and james made extensive use of it as he recalled n wallace of
 calgary and morden h long of edmonton while they weren t due perhaps to a youthful desire the only ones
 active during that period for expression i occasionally conthey do stand out as pioneers in helping tributed to the mac
 cod gazette alberta history spring 1997 the lethbridge news the lethbridge herald as well as to the following eastern journals
 the gue ph mercury the globe the mail grip comic weekly the westminster and prof goldwin smith s literary publication
 the week i acted as a regular paid correspondent for the great falls tribune montana u s and the manitoba
 free press for the latter i managed a few journalistic ‘ scoops notably that of the frank rock slide on
 april 29 1903 by which a mining town in the rockies was almost totally destroyed one of higinbotham s favourite
 topics was unique western expressions in 1891 he wrote an article for the lethbridge news explaining the use of such
 terms as rocky mountain dew broncho buster and chinook nothing can be more interesting he wrote than to sit around
 the fire in the waiting room of one of the hotels of lethbridge and listen to the ‘ old timers
 tell of the bygone days of the country the western phraseology used gives a tinge of romance to the tales
 2 over the years higinbotham gradually amassed a wealth of data on the west there were autographs interviews and general
 observations which he made in tiny notebooks or on scraps of paper an inveterate collector he visited the site of
 fort whoop up and dug up a number of artifacts and documents a short time later he bought from dave
 akers the cannon which had been used at the fort he also collected autographed books guns and anything else that
 took his fancy he was a charter member and librarian of the fort macleod literary scientific historical society and maintained
 friendships with such authors as pauline johnson charles mair bliss carman and nellie mcclung by the 1920 s higinbotham had
 become a distinguished pioneer of lethbridge who was recognized for his detailed higinbotham was a keen observer and was fully
 conscious of the role that he and others were playing in the opening of the west knowledge of southern alberta
 history he was consulted by the federal government when compiling the book place names of alberta and continued to gather
 information from pioneer families after a trip to the arctic in 1928 higinbotham combined his autobiography with his historical research
 to produce a manuscript which was published in 1933 by ryerson press of toronto under the title when the west
 was young the book received excellent reviews and in spite of the depression it proved to be so popular that
 it went into three printings in it higinbotham concentrated on the early history of southern alberta including chapters on the
 indians whiskey traders mounted police missionaries and ranchers he also included a number of interviews and biographies of well known
 western figures encouraged by his success higinbotham produced a second manuscript this one entitled salad days however it did not
 have the internal structure of his first book but was more of an assemblage of his years of research as
 a result it was never published but remained with his personal papers until they were donated to the glenbow archives
 in 1962 as for higinbotham he retired from alberta history spring 1997 earliest records to the union of 1821 with
 a summary of the dunvegan journal 18 o 6 like higinbotham james wallace was an active supporter of historical activities
 being one of the founding members of the calgary historical society in 1923 at that time he outlined his views
 on the role of an historical society the value of such a society in calgary will depend very largely on
 some steps being taken to prevent it developing into an old timers association it may be contended by some that
 in western canada there is but little distinction between the two and that the reminiscences of those now living will
 be regarded as the history in the future but the distinction is this history deals with events so far back
 that we can now distinguish between those which led to important results and those which were only of temporary moment
 no matter how interesting or well written some tale of the old ranchers may be these features alone cannot give
 it a place in historical records unless the events related have been the cause of succeeding events or have had
 a decided influence in later years 6 pharmaceutical work in 1929 and returned to guelph in 1946 three years later
 he published a slim volume of poems entitled foothill and prairie memories a group of poems 3 some of these
 had been written as early as 1884 for special occasions or after the author had learned of an interesting event
 the volume leads off with the poem why i love the west higinbotham died in guelph in 1961 at the
 age of ninety six the other three authors of the 1 920 sl 930 s era shared a common interest
 in the fur trade although each had his specialities james wallace studied early western explorers and travellers j e a
 macleod peigan post on the bow river and m h long provided an academic view of early fur trade history
 james nevin wallace was born in dublin ireland in 1870 and graduated in engineering from trinity college university of dublin
 in 1893 he emigrated to canada two years later working for the toronto hamilton buffalo railway until 1896 when he
 became a private surveyor in 1900 he moved to calgary to become a dominion land surveyor and from 1912 until
 his retirement in 1932 he was director of levelling in connection with railroad work for the federal department of the
 interior probably his most notable achievement as a surveyor was in delineating the boundary between british columbia and yukon territory
 in 1906 07 in addition he was surveyor representative when the boundary was defined between alberta and british columbia between
 1923 and 1925 wallace s first major publication was an english translation of nicolas jérémie 0:jeremie s account of york factory
 undertaken in collaboration with r douglas the book was published in 1926 under the title twenty years of york factory
 1694 1714 jérémnie 0:jeremnie s account of hudson strait and bay 4 it was followed three years later with wallace s
 the wintering partners on peace river from the below john d higinbotham is seen here on his horse chester shortly
 after his arrival in fort mac cod in 1884 left john d higinbothain became a leading merchant in lethbridge and
 was actively interested in the history of the region nalberta history spring 1997 wallace delivered two lectures to the historical
 group southesk ‘ s journey through the west in 1925 and the passes of the rocky mountains along the alberta
 boundary 7 a year later over the years he also worked closely with j e a macleod and other local
 historians and was the author of several articles on the history of surveying and of the fur trade wallace died
 in bowness in 1941 john edward annand macleod was born in sydney nova scotia in 1878 and obtained his law
 degree from dalhousie university in 1903 he practised in sydney with the firm of rose rose macleod for four years
 then moved to western canada he had a law office in didsbury for two years and in 1909 became a
 partner in the prestigious calgary firm of lougheed bennett which had been formed by r b bennett later prime minister
 of canada and sir james lougheed in 1912 maclend moved to clarke carson macleod where he was a partner until
 1920 when he formed macleod robertson smith in 1925 he established macleod edmanson and headed the firm for the next
 two decades in the latter part of his career he was senior partner of macleod dixon burns leitch lomas during
 these years macleod was one of the leading lawyers in calgary he was president of the calgary bar association in
 1912 vice president of the canadian bar association in 1933 and president of the law society of alberta in 1937
 38 he also was a governor of the university of alberta and in 1913 was a charter member of the
 calgary stock exchange macleod s interest in the fur trade was aroused through a comment made by his friend james
 wallace west of calgary was an early site known only as old bow fort in 1922 wallace suggested that the
 ruins might be those of peigan post a hudson s bay company fort which had a brief existence from 1832
 to 1834 maclend visited the site and began above j e a macleod a calgary lawyer was considered to be
 the dean of alberta historians u alberta history spring 1997 research among hudson s bay company records and books relating
 to the fur trade as a result in 1931 the canadian historical review published his findings in an article entitled
 old bow fort 8 on the basis of fur trade records and newspaper interviews with joseph mcdonald and katherine hughes
 he proved conclusively that the two forts were one and the same his appetite for history now whetted macleod maintained
 an active interest in the subject for the rest of his life in 1943 he expanded on his earlier theme
 with an article piegan post and the blackfoot trade 9 and in 1958 he wrote john edward harriott chief factor
 both of these made extensive use of academic sources but also included visits to the sites involved near peigan post
 for example he located an old douglas fir tree into which someone had carved j rowand 18 2 this was
 probably john rowand 1832 carved by the hudson s bay company s chief factor for the saskatchewan district like wallace
 j e a macleod was active in the calgary historical society in the 1920 s and maintained regular contacts with
 like minded fur trade historians in edmonton and winnipeg when the historical society of alberta considered launching a publication program
 in 1952 its president james g j e a macleod was active in the calgary historical society in the 1920
 s and maintained regular contacts with like minded fur trade historians in edmonton and winnipeg macgregor wrote to macleod and
 a half a dozen other leading interested persons in alberta to gain their support macleod was very enthusiastic and later
 contributed an article to the journal also when a branch of the historical society was formed in calgary in 1959

 became its first fellow during the years of the glenbow foundation 1954 66 maclend donated a number of historical collections

 the calgary 1914 oil boom records of the springbank irrigation district back to 1894 and the papers of guy weadick
 organizer of the first calgary stampede when maclend died in 1966 he was described as the dean of alberta historians

 this surprising move what had happened ordinarily they would not have done so for weeks we discovered that they had
 received word of rid s capture hours before we did they had scouts all the way from their reserve to
 the front of the fighting and were kept well informed of what was taking place at frog lake when indian
 agent thomas quinn called a council to inform big bear s band of the duck lake skirmish the whites discovered
 to their great astonishment and dismay that the indians knew more about the affair the news of riel s victory
 certainly was a factor in the violent murders several days later continent in 1910 anthropologist james mooney observed that the
 system was most effective on the plains because of the unobstructed views signals he wrote were commonly conveyed by means
 of smoke fire or the movements of men either mounted or on foot their most frequent purpose was to indicate
 the presence of game or of danger or to define the intentions of an approaching party 4 fires might have
 been used to indicate the presence of a stranded whale on the west coast smoke signals william b cameron a
 white man who escaped the killings later wrote little doubt big bear s band was apprised though signal fires of
 the duck lake fight and the half breed outbreak two hundred miles away within twenty four hours of the engagement
 while we whites at frog lake did not hear of it for some days 2 announced the return of an
 omaha war in an article a grape vine telegraph party and a signalling mirror was used the winnipeg daily times

 to the disturbance locally whites offered similar insights that this telegraphy prevails is and explanations one mountie noted indisputable and
 affords the red man an that this method of quick excellent and rapid means of communication among the indians has

 the little calgary to edmonton between april 20 fire with his blanket for a moment and and april 30 noted
 from signal fires at allowing the smoke to ascend when night and smoke signals during the day he instantly covered

 had seen big offers to replace the stolen goods no this method of quick communication among the indians has always
 remained more or less a mystery although we know that they used smoke and looking glasses for this purpose r
 alberta history spring 1997 doubt the battle river bands had a better knowledge of the military situation in western canada
 than the arriving columns days later the capture of a metis proved this fact strange wrote it is a proof
 of the astonishing rapidity with which news is conveyed by indians that before hearing from general middleton of his engagement
 at fish creek my scouts captured a half breed upon whom a letter was found written from fish creek by
 a half breed engaged there he detailed the position of half breeds and indians and in boastful terms claimed a
 victory declaring that fighting white men was like shooting buffaloes subsequently i received a cipher telegram from general middleton dated
 fish creek 20 th april petition replying that he could not cripple the expedition by leaving more than the two
 companies of about thirtyfive men each already assigned to the rea consequently the alberta field force moved eastward by boat
 and marching column on may 14 campaign strategy had assigned the column to march into the frog lake fort pitt

 metis hostages since their capture of fort pitt on april 16 the 700 member woods plains cree band had remained
 in the a rea living in unaccustomed abundance from goods seized at the post friction however had arisen over the
 rigid camp discipline imposed by the less numerous plains cree and in the their killing of cattle belonging to the
 woods cree the hostages observed that the two cree groups began arranging their tents at opposite ends of the camp

 from riel uncertainty prevailed regarding the rebellion a band council decided to send two scouts to batoche to ascertain the
 military situation the men returned in days with news that the earth trembled at battleford with at the time of

 the deployment of a la rge local garrison since the indians being accustomed to a method of transmitting intelligence marvellous

 dance immediately the indians prepared to fight the longexpected soldiers one thing had been certain as long as the indian
 camp held hostages the soldiers would come the inability of big bea r s band to detect the advance of

 one morning at breakfast we heard that some little distance we saw nellie two old bulls that had been deadly
 struggling with the big ram s horn in enemies for a long time had at last met each hand one

 on me top rail and thought that we would be safe but when the roping etc began we on another

 splendid horseman and a most stampedes i suppose on that occasion reliable man and on this occasion he we without
 doubt saw the most brilliant drove a team composed of four chestnuts feats of horsemanship that the world drawing a
 large wagon we had to ford could produce the effect of the the creek and on our return with the
 excitement on us remained for several load the horses seemed to have a little days difficulty in hauling the load
 out of the creek and up the bank on the other side naturally our appetites were enormous wilson without saying
 anything to us and the way we slept was a caution we stopped the horses in the middle of the
 were continually on horseback fishing stream and then standing on the top of or driving about the country on one
 the load cracked his long whip with the occasion we went for a picnic into the result that the horses
 simply jumped out hills but unfortunately were caught in a of the water and up the bank bad rain storm
 and spent two days i afterwards we found ourselves pretty think in a shack where we were regaled well covered
 up with coal at the back of with enormous quantities of canned the wagon fruits tongue crackers and cheese the
 store of some bachelor rancher my uncle had a four horse team with large democrat that i think must have
 we celebrated my birthday on the been the pride of the district a gray ranche i received from home an
 and chestnut as leaders and a chestnut enormous box of rowntree s chocolates and as we saw very little candy
 we had a great treat old neil scobie offered to give me a pony if i would go over and
 get it from his place a mile or so away and so off i went on foot intending to i
 ride home on arrival i found a chunky little strawberry roan tied up all ready for me it had no
 saddle and i did not quite like the look in its eyes however i expressed my thanks in my best
 manner was given a leg up and started off i went slowly at first but after a while i got
 braver and pressed the pony s sides gently at first and then not quite so gently and we started on
 a beautiful lope and then a little faster and then something happened and i found myself flying through the air
 somehow the tall grass did not soften my fall and i saw stars for a time when i came to
 the cayuse was nowhere to be seen and i never saw it again i arrived home in rather a shame
 faced manner and made as few explanations as possible but ever left by the time of pinkha n s visit
 in 1887 colonel maclend was a stipendiary magistrate he is seen here in his official robes previousls he had been
 commissioner of the north west mounted police alberta history spring 1997 and gray at the wheels the harness was and
 soon we were called to the door to light brown and wilson took great pride watch his arrival we saw
 him coming in keeping the outfit in tip top shape and cracking his whip and with the four the way
 that team travelled up hill and broncos on the gallop there was no down dale without letup was fence in
 front of the house and when he marvellous one time we went on a visit came tearing along we thought
 he to godsals or the garnets i forget would run into the side of it instead of which my uncle
 aunt and party drove which he brought his horses around in and i was permitted to ride skylark it magnificent
 fashion and stopped dead in was a case of galloping hard for me to front of the door goodbyes were
 said keep up and i can still feel the sensation and we bundled on to the top of the of
 that ride coach behind the driver and were off we of course saw quite a few indians we called at
 the hotel and took on board from time to time they appeared to hold joe tassie a well known cigar
 traveller in high regard my uncle stamoxotican from montreal our drive was as they called him but sometimes it uneventful
 until we arrived at kipp seemed to be more a case of cupboard there we picked up a lone horseman
 love as they always expected some who evidently did not relish the idea of tobacco or tea when they made
 their fording the river on horseback polly visits and so sometimes they were quite permitted him to get aboard and
 he tied a nuisance it was rather amusing to see his bronco to one of our wheelers the nellie or
 norman straightening up in a river was still quite high and in the stiff manner and ordering them to middle
 where the horses were forced to mistiput kipinisti which i think meant swim there was some kind of a mix
 up go away quickly and we had quite an exciting time and got a good idea of polly s nerve
 and but on one occasion quite a large control over his horses number arrived at the ranche with the intention
 of going over into the our fellow passenger seemed to be well kootenay country to hunt and fish but supplied
 with red eye and polly had before doing so they had decided to several good horns during the afternoon discuss
 the matter with my uncle there however we bowled along in good was quite a pow wow on the verandah
 shape until we came to the grade down and handing around of tea and tobacco to the ferry near lethbridge
 when my uncle advised them against the trip colonel sam steele in a democrat and because he was afraid that
 the indians in team passed us polly was very the kootenay might object and then indignant that anyone even a
 member of there would be trouble after a long the nwmp should pass her majesty s palaver quite a few
 decided to accept the mail he was feeling so good that he advice but the others thought they would decided
 he really could not put up with go on and so they all shook hands and such effrontery and would
 go straight departed but next day those who had down the hill around which the road started returned and seemed
 very gradually descended to the river he pleased that they had made up their proceeded to pull his horses off
 the road minds not to go and wanted to see my and trotted them towards the brow of the uncle
 and shake hands with him again hill and turned his head round to us saying hold on boys you ll
 be all on our return to winnipeg mrs right macleod accompanied us as far as macleod where we spent the
 night at the when we got to the brow of the hill i house of a friend polly was to
 call for us was simply speechless at the prospect in the morning and we were up bright and i am
 sure my brother was also i and early we had heard of his prowess candidly admit i shut my eyes
 and down above the author augustine mach ray pinkham is seen here about 1910 he was the son of bishop
 w cvprian pinkham of calgary alberta history spring 1997 we went holding on like grim death the that everything was
 all right he returned horses on the gallop when i felt that we to the caboose and looked at us
 as if to had arrived at the bottom of the hill i say that it was part of his regular
 duty opened my eyes polly was making a beautiful curve on two wheels on the our father bishop c w
 pinkham met river bank we trotted on to the ferry and us at dunmore we were so hungry by made
 fast that time eleven o clock without any we were still speechless when a few breakfast that we were all
 in we went minutes later the police team trotted to the one hotel in search of food the down to
 find the ferry on its way across entrance opened right into the bar and with the stage coach which it
 had passed we soon found that it was the chief part at the top of the hill polly seemed quite
 of the establishment we asked for food sober and greatly elated and i humbly and soon a dish of water
 with some suggest not without cause i do not oatmeal swimming in it some fat bacon know which was the
 greater colonel green tea and awful looking bread were steele s surprise or his chagrin at having placed in front
 of us to wait for the ferry s return arriving at lethbridge we were taken the sight was enough we
 then sought care of by another member of the the bar in hopes of getting some soft macleod clan and
 about midnight we drinks which rather to our surprise we went aboard a caboose bound for succeeded in doing i
 suppose it was the dunmore dog tired we tried to sleep first and last time that my father ever but
 i suppose the excitement of the day lined up to the bar there was nothing was too much when daylight
 came we for it but to wait for food until the cpr sat in the cupola wondering if the train
 from the west came along which it trainmen would ask us to have some did shortly then we made for
 the diner grub but there was nothing doing the and oh boy what a meal the charge for conductor had
 on board a splendid pointer and after a while he jumped up the dinner was 75 cents and we certainly
 to the cupola and then on top of the car did full justice to it and appreciated the and started
 towards the engine jumping splendid service we received at the from car to car after satisfying himself hands of the
 pioneer railway company we then sought the bar in hopes of getting some soft drinks which rather to our surprise
 we succeeded in doing i suppose it was the first and last time that my father bishop pinkhaml ever ‘
 lined up to the bar above when travelling home the author was met by his father at dunmore junction seen

 for me the benefits of membership have been alberta history a most professional publication hls torv now a newsletter which
 provides current information and interesting dialogue the varied chapter meetings and the fellowship with those of similar interests it is
 vitally important that we be aware of alberta s traditions history and pioneers we are fast losing our appreciation of
 the past and organizations like the hsa can cure that indifference i heartily recommend the historical society of atherta to
 others and will continue to do so ‘ 5 ‘ 5 ‘ i ‘ 5 ‘ 5 ‘ 1 ‘
