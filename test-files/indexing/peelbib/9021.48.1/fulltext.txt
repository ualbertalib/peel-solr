 far in the future to even be contemplated yet in 1876 an artist deep within the wilderness of the yellowhead
 pass made this pen and ink sketch giving his view of what transportation would be like in the region a
 century later ie 1976 and again in 2076 sitting in his lonely log cabin at the winter quarters of the
 canadian pacific railway survey he pictured himself and friends at the bottom of the drawing in their snow covered camp
 by 1976 he envisioned steam locomotives pulling passenger cars through the pass and by 2076 the air would be filled
 with motor powered balloons in fact the railway traversed the pass about 1912 by that time heavier than air machines
 had already replaced balloons and by the 1930 s aircraft were easily capable of crossing the rockies the jet planes
 satellites moon visits and other events of the 20 th century were beyond imagination yet this unknown artist had the
 right idea and within the scope of his knowledge he portrays a steady advancement in the development of the area

 the mutiny his initiative and daring during the campaign to relieve lucknow earned him four mentions in despatches his most
 celebrated exploit involved using his own artillery battery as cavalry to charge and capture a rebel battery the feat was
 said to be unique in the history of the royal artillery on a visit to simla in 1882 he met
 and married maria elinor taylor shortly after the wedding they returned to england where strange taught at the gunnery school
 and served as the commandant of the artillery repository at woolwich he saw little hope of advancement in the peacetime
 army in an england where the little people at the top of the big empire were bent on shrinking it
 and the withdrawal of imperial garrisons was contemplated 2 the withdrawal of the garrisons presented him with an opportunity british
 colonies in north america had been garrisoned by british troops for over a century but as the colonies progressed towards

 to report on its defences in addition to his regular duties strange worked to keep defence matters in the public
 eye delivering public lectures organizing the dominion artillery association and working for the creation of the royal military college as
 commandant of the citadel he played a central role in the celebration of the 100 th anniversary of the repulse
 of montgomery and arnold s attack on québec 0:quebec in 1775 by 1881 strange had achieved some happiness and status in
 canada he was married with five children and he enjoyed the social life of québec 0:quebec city he was a close
 friend of the québec 0:quebec premier henri gustave joly de lotbinière 0:lotbiniere and on good terms with the governors general who summered
 in québec 0:quebec city he also had received professional recognition in 1879 the two batteries had been honoured with the designation
 royal canadian artillery and in 1881 the goc major general luard praised him as able and well known officer of
 the royal artillery who has devoted ten of the best years of his life and has been like a father
 to the artillery of canada he was however fifty years old and had been on secondment from the royal artillery
 for nine years in 1880 or 1881 he was told that he must either return to regular duty or retire
 strange chose to retire and pursue a second career on his trip to british columbia in 1879 strange had travelled
 through the ranching districts of the american west there was a boom in ranching in the united states in the
 late 1870 s by 1880 the enthusiasm had reached canada and many monied quebecers were investing in ranches in the
 foothills of alberta ranching was attractive to the horse loving upper classes and strange labour disturbances and affrays between ethnic
 religious groups were common in nineteenth century canada police forces were often unable to control rioters and if a magistrate
 requested assistance the militia was obliged to assist the police in restoring order intervening in a divided community to suppress
 riots or labour disputes often put the discipline and loyalty of the volunteer militia to a severe test the two
 batteries better trained and with an esprit de corps were less likely to have divided loyalties and the authorities came
 to rely on them between 1871 and 1881 b battery was called out ten times in québec 0:quebec city alone the
 most serious intervention was in june of 1878 when faced with a charge by rioting construction workers strange ordered his
 men to fire a number of rioters were wounded and one killed in the subsequent investigation strange had the support
 of the federal government prime minister alexander mackenzie wrote to lord dufferin if he erred it was in not sooner

 that one of the accused added insult to injury at the conclusion of a trial in which the accused was
 released the amiable magistrate assured me that the prisoner was willing to give me the kiss of peace which he
 did ta king me unawares 8 while strange was struggling to establish the mcc discontent was growing in the north
 west the disappearance of the buffalo the dispossession of the indians and the beginning of white settlement would have been
 disruptive even if they had been brilliantly managed they were not and appalling conditions among the native people the failure
 to implement the provisions of the indian treaties fully generously and quickly and the failure to clarify questions of land
 title among both métis 0:metis and white settlers led to an armed clash between métis 0:metis and mounted police at duck lake
 on 26 march 1885 trouble had been anticipated and the militia commander major general frederick middleton arrived in winnipeg on
 27 march western settlements fearing a general rising by both indians and métis 0:metis appealed to middleton for troops to protect
 them middleton believed that threats to most settlements were exaggerated and he planned to let them look after themselves while
 he concentrated his troops to crush the métis 0:metis at batoche at calgary most of the mounted police were withdrawn to
 reenforce northern posts and on 20 march strange chaired a meeting of residents to plan local defence on 28 march
 two days after duck lake he chaired a second meeting at which 104 men volunteered to serve in a home
 guard under james walker a retired police superintendent adolphe caron the minister of militia wired strange with a request that

 1880 he applied to the government for the lease of two townships of grazing land on the bow river about
 fifty miles below calga ry and west of the blackfoot indian reserve to finance the ranch strange organized the military
 colonization company mcc and enlisted eastern canadian businessmen and his brother officers as shareholders the mcc was something more than
 a simple commercial ranch and incorporated some of strange s ideas on military colonization he planned to hire young gentlemen
 to teach them stock raising the students would pay 100 per annum for board lodging and instruction students would provide
 some labour and additional labour would be provided by indians who in the words of the prospectus were tractable 6
 strange did not move onto his lease until 1882 shortages of capital hampered the growth of the ranch by february
 1885 there were only 292 horses and 688 cattle on the 70 000 acre lease during 1885 strange bought another
 2 000 head but only by taking on a 30 000 mortgage 7 like many other large ranches with leased
 ranges the mcc was plagued by squatters who staked homestead claims within its lease when the police refused to remove
 the settlers strange appealed to sir john a macdonald the prime minister who may have viewed the leases as an
 interim measure prior to more general agricultural settlement was unwilling to intervene and the ranch continued to experience problems with
 interlopers the ranch also suffered from horse and cattle thieves and prairie fires strange blamed some of the thefts on
 whites but he believed most animals were stolen by his neighbours the blackfoot he was seldom able to identify individual
 thieves and in any event he believed the courts were too lenient and often enlisting a home guard and a
 unit known as the alberta rangers he had more difficulty in securing arms and ammunition from the government stores as
 late as 9 april he wired caron that if he was not going to furnish arms and equipment the force
 should be disbanded on 8 april strange was given command of all troops in southern alberta a day later he
 received word from middleton of the frog lake massacre the massacre convinced many whites that a general rising had begun
 and forced middleton to abandon his plan of concentrating his forces in an attack on batoche he organized a three
 pronged campaign with columns going north to batoche battleford and edmonton strange was given com nand of three militia units
 the 65 th mount royal rifles the 9 th voltigeurs and the winnipeg light infantry as well as some mounted
 police and some locally raised units middleton believed the québec 0:quebec units the 65 th and 9 th were badly trained
 and would be unwilling to fight the french speaking catholic métis 0:metis strange had worked well with french canadian units before
 and welcomed them although his entire force was not in calgary strange set out for edmonton on 20 april the
 three weeks leading up to his departure had tried strange s limited patience and his relations with calgarians with his
 superiors and with the indians before leaving for edmonton he wrote his friend joly de lotbinière 0:lotbiniere i have had a
 terrible time fighting the greed and selfishness of the people here of all the mean cowardly rascals i ever dealt
 with the calgary people are the worst he also complained that the papers were abusing him for being severe with
 the indians and accusing him of only wanting to protect cattle certainly he linked cattle killing and horse stealing to

 criticized for 188 5 strange will cause trouble i always letting big bear get away but he had thought it
 a dangerous experiment avoided serious casualties and possible d giving him command he is a good disaster by refusing the
 temptation to ç 0:c fellow but he is what you call in this attack a strong position he had also country

 their position at about the same time as strange decided to break off his strange left calgary on 20 april
 with 60 attack the cree withdrew to the north mounted men 160 infantry and 175 and strange did not seriously
 begin the wagons and carts the march through pursuit again until 2 june when he knew wet country was arduous
 yet the column that middleton would arrive at fort pitt averaged almost twenty miles per day with reenforcements sam steele
 and a and arrived in edmonton on 30 april small mounted force were sent to follow strange spent two weeks
 in edmonton the cree and came upon them on 3 june waiting for the rest of his force to arrive

 struggling to rebuild his ranch the rebellion was another setback for the ranch general strange and his sons were on
 active service during much of the year and the ranch was rudderless strange s rhetoric during the rebellion worsened his
 relationship with the blackfoot and with government officials a letter in september 1885 from edgar dewdney to macdonald suggests how
 untenable his position had become dewdney wrote that he had decided to go to blackfoot crossing when the governor general
 visited because general strange will probably be there if i was not and he would be a very red blanket
 in the eyes of three bulls crowfoot s warrior they don t like him and i advised oswald illegiblel who
 represents the largest amount of stock in strange s company to get rid of the general or there would be
 trouble no one who understood indians would have acted as strange has done while knowing he had to live alongside
 of them if the indians are down on him there is no one to blame but himself and if they
 occasionally kill a cow of his it is to show their enmity to him and they will take care that
 he does not know who are the miscreants i shall see him and advise him to leave 4 shortly after
 the rebellion a horse kicked strange and broke his leg as it never healed properly riding became difficult and life
 on the ranch much less attractive during his convalescence the ranch was in the hands of his foreman whom strange
 said was extravagant and ca reless 5 extravagance may have been a continuing problem at the ranch one of the
 investors who had responsibility for winding up the affairs of the ranch after strange left placed much of the blame
 for its failure on strange who has so sadly mismanaged and dishonesty strange believed that middleton deliberately downplayed the achievements
 of the alberta field force by not publishing his despatches his cause was taken up by québec 0:quebec newspapers which noted
 that slighting the alberta field force also slighted the french speaking contingents which had been under strange s command while
 middleton was knighted for his part in the campaign and received a purse of 20 000 strange received no public
 recognition although he desperately wanted and lobbied for a cmg companion of the order of st michael st george his
 penchant for sarcasm probably did not help him in his quest in a letter to sir john a macdonald he
 wrote i ask for no honour i am already the most distinguished imperial officer that ever served in canada distinguished
 by not having been years ago given the distinction of three or 4 letters that have fallen to the lot
 of every officer of rank who has served canada from col french to col hewett 3 equally hurtful the imperial

 clareshoim to live with her brother in law and sister mr and mrs i n walker william and clara s
 daughter grace was born in 1906 captain charles lyndon retired in 1903 and died a year later after a long
 and distinguished career as one of alberta s original ranchers his work was carried on by his son william who
 took over the ranch and the duties of postmaster like his father william was inclined to the military and when
 the volunteer after 1890 the growing market for wheat attracted an increasing number of farmers to the district when the
 railroad was built through claresholm in 1891 it suddenly became very much easier for local residents to get supplies and
 the district population continued to grow in 1893 captain lyndon set up an irrigation system bringing water from lyndon creek
 to irrigate about 130 acres of timothy on the north side of the creek this was so successful that it
 was later expanded to include eighty acres of brome lyndon post office was established at the ranch the same year
 with captain lyndon becoming postmaster by this time there were a good many people in the district most of whom
 came to the ranch once a week or so to collect their mail lyndon brought mail from claresholm for the
 post office and also for nearby furman post office most of the year he used a buggy but when the
 creeks were in flood a pack horse was used fred burton then collected the furman mail and took it over
 the ridge south west to furman post office on burke creek now the headquarters of the burke creek ranch later

 war one broke out later that year by this time most william went to europe as major with families had
 motor cars roads were the canadian mounted rifles which somewhat improved and rural people was broken up and the members
 posted were going more often to claresholm so to other units during his absence the lyndon post office was closed
 overseas his wife clara assisted by the four children and whatever other help when clara left the ranch alec she
 could hire carried on at the ranch in patterson and his wife florence went 1917 it became impossible to get
 hired there to manage it one of their first help so clara was forced to take both tasks was to
 replace the old rail corrals lawrence and charles out of school to with 2 x 6 plank ones a big
 job which work at the ranch was done gradually over several years a william returned home in july 1919 few
 of the older buildings had become and almost at once began building a dilapidated and were torn down the huge
 log barn it was sixty feet long and horse herd which was much in excess of thirty feet wide with
 a steep pitched the ranch s actual needs was eating off galvanized tin roof it had lean to box grass
 needed for cattle and was culled stalls along the north side that extended the width to forty five feet the

 i winter 2000 s peter fideers journae 01 march 1793 by allen ronaghan in his book peter fidler canada s
 forgotten surveyoi the late james g macgregor presented an analysis of fidler s explorations in western canada in so doing
 he stimulated considerable interest in the work of the great surveyor i believe however that he made an incorrect analysis
 of fidler s movements in mid march 1793 when fidler was returning to buckingham house after a winter spent with
 people of he blackfoot confederacy i believe too that macgregor failed to spot a mistake which fidler made in identifying
 the water courses which he crossed i shall refer in particular to travels covered by fidler s journal for the
 days march 13 to march 19 1793 days when fidler was travelling in what is now east central alberta on
 march 13 fidler wrote it is stony land here and called so by these indians oo cut tux 2 fidler
 s position that day can probably be fixed with fair precision if we accept that oo cut tux is fidler
 s rendering of okotoks the blackfoot word for rock we may assume that he was near the large rock or
 glacial erratic in township 47 range 11 west 4 this rock is locally quite famous and viking high school graduates
 have often gone to this isolated spot for end of the year parties etc this assumption is strengthened by the
 fact that there are in this same vicinity several good sized lakes one of which camp lake boasts today a
 lovely summer resort it was probably at one of these lakes that the indians built a sweat lodge referred to
 by fidler on march 13 fidler described them as sweating themselves and then immediately plunging over head in some standing
 pools any of these lakes but especially camp lake would serve admirably for this purpose on march 14 the indians
 resumed their march to the northward and travelled fourteen miles during the next two days fidler recorded a low valley
 march 15 a small creek running south east march 16 and a pretty large creek with pretty good current running
 south east march 16 in my opinion fidler has here crossed the upper reaches of buffalo coulee the upper reaches
 of grizzly bear coulee and the vermilion river just east of where it is joined by stony creek he is
 therefore a few miles east of where macgregor assumed he would be in his analysis these few miles are important
 however in that they involve fidler s crossing of the vermilion river the course of the vermilion river caused early
 geographers and cartographers a great deal of trouble and this confusion is reflected in fidler s observations concerning it 3
 the vermilion river rises in the torlea flats south west of viking and flows in a northerly direction past vegreville
 east of two hills in township 54 range 11 it is not so much a river as a chain of
 lakes to the east of that drainage it begins a long curve to the south east and south until near
 mannville it is in the northern part of township 50 east of vermilion it flows through a deep valley until
 in township 52 ranges 3 and 4 it makes a sharp turn at the elbow and flows in a north
 easterly direction to flow into the north saskatchewan at lea park its course appears on modern maps as a ver

 where he planned to visit his sister matilda it is uncertain how long he stayed there but he arrived in
 winnipeg around 1895 he remained there l or a year assembling information about opportunities to start a new life in
 the more western parts of the country from there the cpr provided him with a free pass to edmonton he
 was amazed when he saw the endless grasslands of the canadian prairies and decided to stop over at regina there
 he rented a team and a driver and went to explore the open land his first impression was the sight
 of abandoned agricultural equiplilent but he looked in vain for houses the driver explained that because of lack of water
 the farmers had given up their farms eventually the buildings were destroyed by prairie fires this information did not enhance
 his desire to become a farmer he continued his journey to calgary where he saw for the first time the
 snow capped rocky mountains he breathed the invigorating air that raised his spirits and as he recalled in his memoirs
 he almost wanted to yodel the next day he boarded the weekly train for edmonton he was the only passenger
 and felt he was travelling like royalty i ic wrote some time in the afternoon i reached wetaskiwin there was
 no one at the station to welcome me the grassy streets were deserted i made for the only hotel the

 the devil are you his name was george turner a rancher from crooked lake this man went over to the
 stairs and interrupted a friendly little game of poker upstairs down to greet the new arrival came bob edwards later
 his best friend and colleague in the alberta legislature afterwards anthony called on j l c miquelon the father and
 first postmaster of the town which had at that time thirty two permanent inhabitants including the unborn babies miquelon had
 come to wetaskiwin in 1892 as the first resident of the newly surveyed town site and had erected the first
 building another pioneer was john west who was the first general merchant of wetaskiwin he had great faith in the
 future of wetaskiwin and advised de rosenroll to settle there in the most fertile region of the west he did
 and he never regretted it as de rosenroll was an outgoing intelligent and amiable person he was 4 t i
 alberta history i winter 2000 soon a friend of the most important settlers of the time one of those was
 j h walker a genial scholarly wellinformed english gentleman who had come to wetaskiwin in 1893 and had opened the
 first drug store he was also involved in the management of the town s public school another pioneer who eventually
 opened a general store and farm implement business was noah william gould he had arrived in the country in 1892
 bringing in two cars of breeding cattle one double deck car of sheep and one car of horses and farm
 implements he settled first on battle river in his memoirs de rosenroll talks of many other first time settlers he
 states this district wetaskiwin was eminently adapted for cattle ranching an abundance of rich prairie pasture where the buffalo used
 to roam a nutritious wild hay and a plentiful supply of excellent water what more was needed to make this
 a livestock country the earliest and largest ranching enterprise was that of mcdonnell and ramsey before 1884 this firm had
 a trading post at the leavings just south where ponoka stands now and where the hudson s bay company also
 had a post each of the partners had an indian housekeeper who were sisters their father stood high in the
 council of the cree indians during the indian troubles in 1885 the hudson bay store was raided and completely cleaned
 out by the indians while the store of mcdonnell and ramsey was never touched the influence of their father in
 law afforded them protection later they transferred their business to bear s hills plain on the calgary edmonton trail four
 miles south of wetaskiwin which was no town then the first post office between edmonton and red deer was holbrook
 six miles south of hobbema bear s hills post office was then established with one of the partners robert ramsey
 as postmaster the ranch headquarters of mcdonnell and ramsey were at battle lake where the asker settlement is now a
 choice location for raising and fattening cattle at the bear s hills store a large trade was carried on with
 the indians ranchers and early homesteaders and large quantities of pelts and numerous cattle were traded in other settlers and
 homesteaders whom de rosenroll mentions in his memoirs are elzear laboucan frank lucas francois adam martin edwards charles rodberg leon
 lalande albert schindler and others anthony de rosenroll s first enterprise was a cattle raising business which he did in
 partnership with thomas r jevne a scandinavian settler at the end of three years they sold the herd and divided
 the large profit anthony then invested in the purchase of two hundred head of cattle from a buffalo lake rancher
 and moved his quarters to hay lakes after seven years of successful operation he sold the ranch with all the
 livestock to ri dailey during this time a station on the nearby railway line was named rosenroll after anthony but
 was changed in 1910 to bittern lake some time in the afternoon i reached wetaskiwin there was no one at

 of the town sports decided to have a fox hunt four of the animals had been captured in a sliding
 box a few days previous and nothing remained but to mount gather the hounds and let reynard loose at three
 o clock the hour appointed some eighteen horsemen accompanied by two hounds and a motley group of dogs consisting of
 terriers mastiffs bull dogs spaniels setters and in fact everything bearing the likeness of a dog congregated on the open
 prairie north of the town the huntsmen and dogs were ranged about a hundred yards behind the box containing the
 foxes one was let loose and as he scampered off with a whoop holler the whole band were in hot
 pursuit little john mounted on a small black pony with his heart stirred with recollections of hunts in merry england
 with excitement beaming from every feature and his coat tails flying in the wind was seen whipping his charger to
 the front determined to be in at the death but master reynard was not to be captured so easily the
 pack led by kirkham s dog kennedy and munro s black hound closed rapidly on the fox and just as
 the foremost huntsman was about to congratulate himself on being first at the death the fox would take a sudden
 turn the hounds dashing past in a straight line and so the horseman before mentioned found himself in the rear
 after several minutes of excitement with the fox dodging the hounds baying and the horsemen wheeling and winding in and
 out munro s hound as last captured reynard and death no i was recorded after a breathing spell the huntsmen
 and dogs were ranged as before and another let loose this was the most exciting chase of the day kirkham
 s hound which is an exceptionally swift one showed up in great form in this chase and after a very
 clever piece of heading off at the last came up with reynard on the dead run and ere he could
 turn had seized him by the shoulders and thrown him high in the air for the dogs to finish the
 next was a repetition of the first and second but the last fox escaped by taking to the ravines where
 it was impossible to follow all told it was a most successful hunt and everyone in high spirits it is

 the rocky mountains to pay a visit to the fine ranch of the northwest cattle co which embraces an area
 of about 140 000 acres the ranch is under the management of mr stimson who has a proprietary interest in
 it this seems to me the right sort of thing viz that the manager should be at all events in
 part the owner of the ranch such ranches are i fancy all the more likely to succeed especially when the
 manager is like mr stimson a practical stockman major milburne i may add is one of the proprietors of the
 ranch and i am indebted to him for many courtesies the trail from calgary runs due south crossing stretches of
 flat prairie rolling the ranch in question was located some nine years ago and is leased from the dominion government
 at a nominal annual rent per acre the place bears the euphonious name of pekisko which is of indian origin
 the manager fred stimson as he is popularly called rode through this vast country of the foothills searching for a
 location for his shack or ranchman s log hut ascending one of the ridges which adorn the landscape he saw
 away beneath a pretty well wooded coulee bend on the highwood river which is a limpid stream cold clear and
 bright as silver this is where i shall camp right away he said for the country the grass the streams
 and springs and pools of water just about fill up the bill and stimson is a fine fellow genial witty

 the spot was once the scene of a bloody encounter between hostile tribes and stimson has found skulls of indians

 the rockies form for hundreds of miles north and south an excellent grazing country well adapted for cattle raising but
 it is not so well suited to arable cultivation though turnips grow very well wheat is out of the running
 entirely at an altitude of 3 500 to 4 000 feet and oats will ripen perhaps once or twice in
 a decade of years potatoes grow vigorously enough but they are liable to be cut by the summer frosts which
 often also ruin the oats save for forage the country indeed is and must remain essentially a grazing country with
 fugitive patches of cultivation it is a well watered country mountain streams springs from the ridges ponds and lakes being
 numerous seldom have the cattle more than a mile to go for drink and though the streams partially northwest cattle

 all the time the herbage is to an englishman s untutored eye sparse and wiry but it is certainly far
 more nutritious than it looks flax lupin and the wild pea or vetch are indigenous and perennial in many parts
 forming a valuable addition and variation to the crude prairie grass natural meadows abound where the land is flat and
 damp and the wild sage gives a piquant and grateful odor to the hay as a matter of fact the
 natural herbage far left this southern a iberia roundup crew about 1901 includes cowboys from the bar u walrond new
 oxle and 07 ranches above these are time bar u brands registered in the official brand book of 1889 of
 the country is of superior quality for the stock are all healthy and most of them fat grand steers of
 1 200 to 1 800 pounds rolling in obesity any amount of shelter is found on the slopes of the
 ridges in the valleys and coulees and behind the buttes which frequently occur and it is said land shelter is
 the best of all the number of cattle belonging to the pekisko ranch is estimated at 9 000 but where
 the herds roam in splendid freedom over scores and even hundreds of thousands of acres in almost numberless valleys coulees
 and plains the exact number can hardly be ascertained even when the round up is completed the immense herds have
 been greatly improved by the shorthorn and hereford until nearly every trace of the native blood has been obliterated and
 among them are a number of pedigree cows and bulls of shorthorn blood the prepotency of the imported blood is
 seen so prominently as to hide entirely the old foundation and the herds are essentially shorthorn and hereford in character
 the former greatly predominating calves young and old run with their dams and are healthy and vigorous to a degree
 not otherwise obtained and it is common to find two or three heifers of successive years still hanging around so
 to speak the apron strings of their mothers but the steers early discard all parental control summer and winter alike
 the cattle young and old have hitherto rustled for their food seldom is it that any hay is given to
 them and indeed until recently no hay has been put up for the purpose the prairie grass has the property
 of curing where it stands forming in situ pasturage for the winter sometimes it is covered with snow but this
 blows off into the swamps and hollows if it does not freeze on its surface if it does and remains
 so for any length of time many of the weaker cattle die and most of the younger calves the foothills
 of the rockies form for hundreds of miles north and south an excellent grazing country well adapted for cattle raising
 but it is not so well silted to arable cultivation though turnips grow very well alberta history i winter 2000
 the mortality some winters on ranches unfavorably situated in reference to food drink and shelter is as much as twenty
 five to thirty per cent and eight or ten per cent is considered moderate it is obvious that such losses
 dissipate what might be a very handsome profit in itself and as a matter of fact the profits on ranching
 on a large scale are seldom more than the ordinary percentage on money loaned on mortgage and elsehow in canada
 the losses occur chiefly among calves which are often killed by coyotes and other carnivora lean and weakly stock of
 all ages and pilgrim cattle that is cattle that have been brought from a distance and are not yet acclimatised
 in 1884 on visiting this country i ventured to say that it would be found necessary to provide hay for
 ranch cattle to save them from absolute starvation in severe winters well the winter of 1886 87 was one of
 the worst on record killing off a large number of cattle by starvation and in september 1887 the time of
 my last visit a large quantity of hay had been put up that is harvested most of the ranches just
 then the calves the round up being over and the branding finished were being weaned and taught to eat hay
 in order to carry them safely through the winter it is of course obviously a good thing to teach them
 to eat it before they are snowed out and are compelled to eat it all this involves trouble and cost
 but there can be no two rational and diverse opinions as to the wisdom of it this ranch is a
 horse ranch too and carries a band of some 400 mares as well as many young colts and fillies the
 great majority of the mares are of superior quality and while the few inferior ones are being weeded out imported
 sires of good blood are being mated with the better ones in this way superior carriage and army horses and
 even hunting horses for the english shires are being produced these horses have been bred together for several years and
 it is amusing to see a mare with three of her own offspring colts and fillies alike bearing each other
 company anyway colts have a much stronger filial instinct than steers have and do not repudiate parental authority at an
 early age the round up of the cattle is the event of the year in fact there are two events
 the spring and the autumn round up i have had the good fortune to be present at the chief event
 of the year and was greatly interested in it an outfit from two or three ranches is made up consisting
 of cowboys cooks horses wagons tents and provisions the meet is arranged beforehand each ranch sending its contingent the one
 i saw was at the mouth of the highwood river where i camped along with the boys bed and board
 are alike rude but substantial and each man has his work to do four or five saddle horses each cowboy
 has for there is a good deal of hard riding to be done throughout the day at night all the
 horses save one are turned out loose on the prairie that one is for the night herd who is told
 off to keep the band from straying too far and he is in the saddle all night in all there
 were well nigh a hundred horses by daybreak the camp was astir by six o clock the men have breakfasted
 and by half past six the horses wanted for the first work of the day have been lassoed and saddled
 not until the boys are mounted does the captain tell them off to scour this that or the other part
 of the vast prairie but as soon as the orders are given off go the boys at a full gallop
 the captain of the outfit i joined was george lane a wiry canadian brown as bronze coin and tough as
 a cowhide lasso a fine fellow is lane and modest as brave men always are or ought to be one
 night as he rode along the prairie under the light of the moon he was attacked by a band of
 hungry wolves but you cannot get him to see that any danger was in it they flew at his legs
 and at his horse s throat and he shot five or six of them with his revolver but you cannot
 get him to tell you the tale oh well he will say it wasn t much after all yet after
 all lane can indulge in picturesque language at times away on the horizon you see after a time herds of
 cattle gathering and shortly several hundreds are massed on the prairie here the cutting out is done and the cows
 and calves are driven off to the adjacent corral the calves to be branded and the males among them such
 of them as re not wanted for sires castrated inside the corral which is a huge stockade of logs strongly
 built and eight to ten feet high there are two cowboys on horseback who lasso the calves by one of
 their hind legs and drag them along the turf to the point outside of which the branding fire is blazing
 here the calf is seized by two men one in front and the other behind and held firmly while the
 brand is put on held in an ingenious and simple manner the branding irons burn a little into the skin
 leaving a mark which is permanent meantime the calf bawls out lustily more however from terror than pain but in
 a tithe of the time it has taken to describe the process he is liberated to rejoin his dam above
 one of the most famous stories about george lane then manager of the bar u was an incident when he
 was attacked by wolves according to sheldon he shot five or six of them before they fled in 1914 artist
 cm russell painted his interpretation of the incident as described to him by lane alberta history i winter 2000 the
 life of a cowboy is rough and hard no doubt but it has a charm all its own which is
 enough to attract men to it and keep them at it such men i mean as have sand enough in
 them to master the situation the genuine cowboy has a good deal of professional pride and looks with a sort
 of disdainful pity on tenderfeet that is on men who shirk the rough work of the ranch it is an
 odd thing that cowboys almost invariably smoke cigarettes in preference to pipes lots of gently nurtured young englishmen men who
 have been to the universities are to be seen in all the war paint of a cowboy mounted on a
 cuyuse and more or less firmly seated in a mexican saddle these saddles have a projection on the pommel round
 which one end of the lasso is secured the other end being round the horns of a steer or the
 leg of a calf as the case may be not a few of these young fellows however fed by funds
 from home hang around the ranches or loiter in calgary simply aping the cowboy and shirking the work two smart
 young fellows i stayed with one night at their ranch a horse ranch on the north bank of the highwood
 river these have the requisite grit and will come out top in the work one of them is a son
 of the late general macpherson who died for his country in burmah the other is the grandson of mr ross
 of early wimbledon fame of the hospitality so heartily bestowed by these two gentlemen i can speak in terms of
 warm praise of their housekeeping well 1 need only say that with no feminine skill available it was about as
 good as might be expected men especially young men are seldom worth their salt as housekeepers meantime ranching is settling
 down leaving the romantic stage and soon the unsuitable ranchers will find their true level and be weeded out fred

 handsome withal friendly edmontonians the citizens of edmonton are as courteous and obliging as any population of any city on
 earth if you are interested and have time to stop to listen if they know you are a stranger or
 a visitor to their town you will find them the most optimistic people you have ever met in your life
 it does you good to hear them talk and if you come from the east you long to get a
 little of this enthusiasm bottled up to send home and while talking of the east it is astonishing how you
 forget there is an east when you are in the west you are first interested then you grow enthusiastic and
 by the time you have been three days beyond winnipeg you are a convert to all their optimism and you
 take as much participation in their future welfare as the mayor who as first magistrate sets the pace we did
 not meet the mayor of edmonton nor a number of other prominent men but we were told that we should
 have met them and that we had missed much by the oversight but this was not necessary as we had
 caught the fever quick and when we left edmonton we were surprised to find ourselves in possession of a store
 of information that would beat that of any tenderfoot who ever visited that city it was worth coming out west
 to catch it and we are doubtful if it will ever leave us frank carrell in the quebec telegraph reprinted

 warriors of the king prairie indians in world war 1 by l james dempsey regina canadian plains research center 131
 pp illus paper 19 95 when war erupted in europe in 1914 many western canadian indians were only a generation
 away from the days of intertribal warfare elders still extolled the virtues of being a warrior and men with battle
 records were highly esteemed within the camps in this book dempsey looks at the reason why so many prairie indians
 joined up what happened to them in the service and what happened afterwards he states there were three main reasons
 they enlisted one was an emergence of the warrior spirit that had not been completely eradicated by the government a
 second was a feeling of patriotism towards the crown not the canadian government with whom their treaties had been signed
 and a third was to escape the stagnation and poverty that gripped most reserves they were also encouraged by indian
 agents and recruiting officers especially when troops were in short supply later in the war many indians distinguished themselves overseas
 henry norwest became the leading sniper among the allies while john ballantyne accumulated fifty kills through sniper fire louis wood
 joe dreaver norman sanderson alex brass and others were awarded the military medal for bravery in action many were wounded
 and several died in battle or from the effects of poison gas after the war indian veterans returned with a
 much broader view of the world and a hope that they would be treated as equals with their non indian
 comrades but it was not to be the indian veterans were placed under the thumb of the indian department and
 gained few if any of the benefits given to other veterans the author includes many fascinating letters written by indians
 while overseas and provides a list of all known soldiers and their service records it is a good read into

 al drum heller interest in western canadian dinosaur remains was sparked in 1909 when barnum brown of the american museum
 of natural history new york visited the john wagner ranch near drumheller this started what the author calls the canadian
 dinosaur rush as crates of bones were exported to the united states pressure was placed on canadian authorities to initiate
 their own collecting program the result was that the canadian government brought the sternberg family into the picture charles h
 sternberg described as perhaps the best known collector in the world and his sons george levi and charlie began work
 in 1911 and excavated scores of dinosaur remains for the national museum spalding goes on to tell about the dinosaur
