 class mail registration no 1958 medical pioneering in alberta by george douglas stanley my endeavour is to present some of
 the sentiment that belongs to the archives of pioneer medicine as medicine existed during the foundation of what is now
 western canada s province of alberta we cannot find a better illustration of the place of sentiment in its relationship
 to medicine than alberta s pioneer doctor w m mackay he received his medical education in bonnie scotland and his
 teachers included sir james y simpson the discoverer of chloroform anaesthesia james syme whose fame in surgery was widely extolled
 by all authorities joseph lister the real discoverer of antisepsis in surgery and george wilson these men were the sources
 of the fort simpson fort chipewyan peace sentiments that were instilled into the river or on the athabasca river he
 mind and soul of dr mackay when he travelled by boat canoe dog sleigh or boarded the 103 x 25
 x 17 foot sailing on foot once he skated 200 miles from barque prince albert at london on grouard to
 get to edmonton to supply june 13 th 1864 and set sail for york medical care where there was no
 doctor factory on the hudson bay his task ultimately after thirty four years of was to bring medical help to
 a field the most strenuous self sacrificing and which extended east to west from the unusual medical practice of any
 of can hudson bay to the rocky mountains ada s pioneer doctors he settled per the nature of the demand
 for his pro manently in edmonton in 1898 here fessional help moved his headquarters he continued in many ways to
 extend widely and frequently thus one learns the benefits of his sentiment to others of his struggling with smallpox in
 the one modest but important step in this mackenzie district or with the plague extension process was his organization at
 york factory of something else at in 1902 of the northwest medical as lesser slave lake great slave lake sociation
 a body which later became dr george douglas stanley lld began practising medicine in southern alberta in 1901 a former
 m l a for high river and m p for calgary east he held many high offices in his own
 profession and in 1947 was made a life member of the college of physicians and surgeons of alberta this paper
 first appeared in vol 1 no 1 of the alberta historical review in april 1953 the view at top was
 taken in dr r g brett s operating room at banff in 1896 the edmonton academy of medicine fort macleod
 was sent out by the mounted police in 1878 and later open dr mackay s struggle against the ed his
 private practice and travelled handicaps of nature and geography was over the old medical trail until his death the starting
 point of the original trail in 1913 he was first president of the in medicine over which the later doc
 n w t medical association in 1889 tors travelled with gradually improved facilities for living and travel and dr e
 a braithwaite was with the scientific advances as the years passed ivlounted police in fort macleod in 1884 along arrived
 at duck lake to care for the wounded after the fight there and was i shall endeavour to outline the
 conditions through which that trail passed present at the execution of louis riel his medical trail covered many parts and
 the surroundings in which the ear of alberta over many years in private liest country doctors had to bring their
 and departmental service medical services to their widely separated settlements of those days this task dr h c wilson of
 edmonton dr could have been much more properly l j munro of edmonton dr j d laffulfilled by dr mackay
 or by any one ferty of calgary dr g h malcolmson of the old time doctors but i can men
 of frank dr 0 c edwards of the tion only a few for instance one was blood indian reserve and
 many others dr f h mewburn who performed al also took important parts in the making berta s first appendectomy
 and many of the earliest parts of those early trails years later became university of al over which the profession
 brought their berta s first professor of surgery dr medical services neville k lindsay could have told much about the
 old trail referred to my effort now must necessarily be because he arrived in calgary on the restricted to the
 conditions and circum c p r s first train in august 1883 and stances in southern parts of alberta as
 became calgary s first resident doctor i found them upon my arrival at the the c p r s first
 railway surgeon the beginning of the present century cattle government s first indian doctor chair ranches were in the foothills
 and some man of calgary general hospital s first farmers homesteaded on the prairies medical staff a member of calgary
 s the railways had been built with the first municipal council master of cal exception of the aldersyde to lethgary
 s first masonic lodge and father bridge branch the roads consisted of calgary s first born child largely of trails
 across the prairies or along the streams or up the foothill another was dr edward h rouleau valleys these trails
 in the main were who arrived at battleford in 1885 and formed by the wheels of wagons and of at
 calgary in 1887 he was involved horses hoofs and the durability of with many persons whose names are their many
 diversions depended entirely associated intimately with the history upon the amount of travel demanded of the canadian west including louis
 by the settler or settlers to which each riel big bear poundmaker general branch happened to lead trails wound middleton
 and col otter as a doctor themselves in and out across the scathe served at fort saskatchewan ba tered prairie
 homesteads over their toche cutknife hill and duck lake hills around or through their sloughs he became one of the
 initial members through the rivers and creeks and into of n w t medical association in 1889 so called fords
 of rivers and lakes characteristically during wet seasons and dr r g brett arrived at calgary on high waters a
 ford for a team and demothe same train as dr n k lindsay in crat one day was often found
 to be a 1883 and soon settled in banff where swim for horses and drivers the next he constructed a
 really distinctive part again often in winter time saving shortof early medicine s trail both in regard cuts were made
 across the ice on certo treating human illnesses and in the tam large sloughs or small lakes organization of the
 members of the medical profession dr g a kennedy of however on a goodly number of oc vide a landing
 place for the buggy and themselves in emphasizing the necessity of fording streams in those days i should point out
 that prior to 1900 there was only one traffic bridge between calgary and macleod and that was over the highwood
 river further okotoks and high river were the only points where there were business communities of any type and there
 was only one medical practitioner between the crow s nest railway and the c p r main line and between
 the rockies and medicine hat hence the reader will readily understand that a medical call made by horse and buggy
 or democrat over a distance of forty or fifty miles each way was not unusual and it was made along
 the trails or by landmarks in the day or by stars in the night where such marks did not exist
 true as farming settlers increased in number as villages sprang up and as graded dirt roads multiplied some of the
 travelling difficulties of the doctors lessened here and there however a sixty foot roadway graded through a rich pot hole
 of gumbo often supplied a sticky obstruction that defied both the author dr george stanley was a pioneer doctor of
 the high river area casions a doctor driver was tempted to man a id beast the alternative of try the
 ice of an unfamiliar stream and course was to carry a good pair of to drop the horses and outfit
 into the barbed wire clippers with which to cut deep water i shall not describe what one s way to
 safety or to look for help such a calamity entailed but usually it forced a sudden cry for help which
 at another obstacle which the pioneer times distance made hard to find i doctor had to face daily and often
 were recall once when my two horses broke the barbwire gates which gave the trails through the ice and still
 hitched to the admission to the fenced off ranching or buggy struggled successfully to free farming districts through which the
 themselves from the watery wreckage trail wound itself to find the shortest i threw off most of my own clothing
 and safest route over which it could waded into the water hole and unhit pass further if the doctor s
 team hapched the horses to give them their free pened to be still in the broncho stage dom on another
 occasion two of us got of breaking and the doctor preferred into the swollen sheep creek and had to have
 them for use during the balance to stand on the democrat seat while the of the journey rather than walking
 each horses swam themselves and us to gate demanded the tying of those bronsafety on still another occasion my old
 chos to the gate post twice first on the team of black horses swam me and my nigh side while
 the gate was being buggy through the swollen highwood opened and again on the off side while river and certainly
 with more intelli it was being closed believe me the gence than their driver had shown at stretching of the
 barbwires to close the any stage of the performance they gates was some job at times i recall one selected
 the only possible spot on the professional call of about thirty five opposite cutbank shore that could pro miles each
 way which i had to make often it entailed the struggling with that there was a fixed intimacy between exactly
 19 of those notorious and ill the old time family doctor and his pafamed barbwire gates going and corn tients
 which will take a huge volume ing or a grand total of thirty eight for of modern laboratory science to
 replace one single call however when i was this entire paper could be used to able to take my old
 faithful blacks the tying process was unnecessary but give illustrations of the physical and when they were already over worked
 social difficulties the pioneer doctor had to overcome in order to extend his proit was necessary to rent a livery
 team fessional services to his patients i have then the wire gates and a heap of other troubles came into
 the picture with a space for but a few of these vengeance first when dr de veber lived at macleod
 in the early days the boyd this would appear to be the proper family at morley could get no doctor
 point to emphasize one outstanding as in calgary to visit their mother who set of the family doctor in those
 pioneer was very ill so the call was rushed on days namely that every settler on the horseback to dr
 de veber he travelled prairie and every rancher in the foot the one hundred and sixty seven miles hills was
 without exception his depend to morley on horseback riding continuable and ever ready friend in need and ously for eighteen
 hours changing further every rural home or homestead horses four times and averaging the er s shack was wide open
 to him but trip at nine miles per hour the country doctor who had learned a lot from past experience
 usually found second the writer heard dr archer an excuse to sleep on a chair with his summarize the contrast
 between those head on the table rather than in a bed early days and today as follows in the bedding
 in many rural homes was those days it took longer to make a call frequently over populated with creep on
 a single patient than it now takes ing visitors which homestead seekers to make a mercy flight from edmonton had
 left behind the settler s stable pro to the arctic he went on to point out vided food and shelter
 for the doctor s that rush calls often varied in their horses and if circumstances required significance but were all
 equally urgent it necessary horses and equipment for as far as the doctor s getting there was the doctor s
 use concerned on one occasion he rushed thirty miles with horses to a small rural in all my years of
 pioneer practice i home found a laparotomy for general cannot recall ever receiving unkind peritonitis necessary and performed treatment by
 any one single settler the operation on the kitchen table theremale or female in fact every rural man by saving
 the woman s life the next woman and child was the doctor s con night he received an equally urgent
 call sistent and unfailing helper it was a from a still further distance to help a universally accepted fact that
 the doc girl that was sick unto death when tor s first duty was to get to the patient he
 arrived after much struggle through it was also accepted by the settler that the snow he found the girl calmly
 it was equally his duty to see that the painting the kitchen wall i am feeling doctor got there all
 realized that the much better now doctor was the only presence of the doctor in itself inspired explanation dr archer
 commented a comforting confidence and a sense of further that fifty years ago the country security to the patient and
 to his home doctor spent most of every twenty four a confidence the more necessary and hours on the prairie
 trails while today the more readily created because of pio his group of nine medical men took only neering conditions
 about three or four country calls a week personally i can recall one occasion without passing any comments con when
 i spent nine whole days and cerning the personal and emotional re nights out of eleven on full duty withlationship
 between today s instituted out removing my clothes modern family and its medical advisor it must be affirmed with emphasis

 hospital and operations were done in and proceeded onward to beat the stork the patient s home or elsewhere if
 the at his own game on another occasion patient had no home he performed his he received what he understood
 was a first appendectomy in 1889 in a saloon medical call twenty miles in the couna pus case drained with
 recovery try he took a young dentist with him he operated successfully on a case of for company the call
 turned out to be intestinal obstruction in a room over a a tedious and prolonged obstetrical livery stable with the

 the doctor i was called urgently one night to rush had to sleep in fact how to do most to
 a woman in convulsions about forty things the doctor couldn t do himself miles distant i took my old team
 and their innate wisdom was always a buggy and forced them to their limit great asset to a young doctor
 to get there the patient was late in her pregnancy and had had two con in conclusion our readers should
 be vulsions in those days we proceeded reminded that the pioneer doctor faced forthwith to deliver in such cases not
 only the numerous physical and was in a one room shack on a hot sum geographical obstacles but in addition

 took the pail honour the struggle which those early and dipper to the slough one quarter medical pioneers in alberta

 poundmaker s capture of a wagon train by john w shera when the rebellion broke out in the early spring
 of 1885 i was at home on my father s homestead near regina to which place the family had come
 from roscommon ireland in 1882 our farm was not far from the north west mounted police barracks which i frequently
 visited i went there to see if i could enlist in one of the units i was told that as
 i was only seventeen years of age the only place for me was in the transport service as a teamster
 i was duly enrolled was issued a snyder rifle and twelve rounds of ammunition we were given no uniforms we
 were sent to swift current by train this was rail head for the column commanded by colonel otter who had
 marched to relief of battleford at swift current i found that a train for the night there were no fire
 side of wagons was about to start for battle sing songs most of our fuel was buffalo ford most of
 the drivers were farmers chips as there was very little wood to who owned their horses and wagons be had
 there were a few bluffs of popwhich were hired by the government lar and willow here and there near at
 generous prices i was assigned to sloughs and water courses and we drive a good team i did not know
 who secured kindling wood from these we the owner was our wagons were the fared better for wood when we
 reached ordinary farm wagons with large tar the eagle hills at first after leaving paulins to cover the load they
 were saskatchewan landing on the south loaded with canned beef sacks of oats saskatchewan river thirty miles north flour beans
 sugar salt pork and other of swift current we had nothing for supplies for men and horses some bal kindling
 wood and chopped up some of ed hay was taken along the tailboards of the wagons there were about thirty
 wagons in when about to camp for the night our train most of them were hauled by the wagons circled
 and stopped one by two horse teams but a few wagons one when each reached a place in the were
 hauled by oxen and the speed of corral with the right front of each the column had to conform to
 the speed wagon box touching the left rear of the of the ox carts we had no escort of wagon
 next in front in this way a comsoldiers and there were no men on plete circle was formed with the
 horses saddle horses we were expected to de and oxen inside except when they were fend ourselves with our rifles
 in case put out for a time to graze but all our of attack and took turns in furnishing animals
 were tied up inside the corral strong guards at night at night we provided our own blankets and saskatchewan landing
 was the head slept on the ground or in the wagons of navigation for the steamer northas we thought best
 most of us slept on cote which had ferried otter s column the ground under the wagons our food across
 the river and was kept very busy was cooked at one fire in the centre of transporting troops and supplies
 down the corral this fire was carefully cx stream to general middleton s main tinguished when our cooking was done
 force then approaching batoche we john w shera had the distinction at the time of publication of this paper in
 april 1953 of being the only surviving member of the old north west territorial assembly for many years he had
 been collector of customs at the port of edmonton but was retired when his paper appeared in the first issue
 of alberta historical review this remarkable photo although deteriorated shows the transport teams in camp during the 1885 riel rebellion
 the photographer was capt james peters who obtained a number of significant views under fire left the landing about may
 6 th and early in the morning of may 14 as followed the trail nearly due north to we were
 moving through the hills not battleford which otter s column had far from the north saskatchewan river used about three
 weeks before this we entered a beautiful open piece of trail led west of the coteau and west level ground
 encircled by bluffs of popof the bad hills over absolutely open lar and suddenly realized that we were country otter
 had bridged the eagle surrounded at a distance by well mount river about ninety miles from battle ed half breeds
 and indians cantering ford and on crossing it we soon got into their horses in a big circle we whipped
 the eagle hills where there was greater up our teams of horses and quickly danger of surprise attack we were
 all formed a corral on a small knoll the residents of new white settlements and ox wagons were slow but
 all got into we knew enough about the indians to our circle be sure they were all dangerous and that
 the half breed rebels were worse it appears that after the fight at cut than the indians shortly after entering
 knife chief poundmaker was uneasy the eagle hills we learned from a patrol and expected the troops in battleford of
 despatch riders that a big battle had to be re inforced and again come out been fought at cut knife
 near battle to attack him he had been receiving ford between colonel otter s column urgent messages from rid then
 bower and chief poundmaker s army consist down the saskatchewan valley to come ing of half breeds and crees with
 some down and join him rid s messages were stoneys the result of the battle was no doubt more urgent
 after his halfnot favourable to the troops who suf breeds got the worst of it at the fish fered considerable
 losses in killed and creek battle when he fought the column wounded colonel otter was glad to be commanded by
 general middleton himable to break off the engagement and self there were a considerable number get back to the police
 barracks and the of half breeds with poundmaker and buildings of the little town of battle these urged the chief
 to move down the ford this was a place of considerable river to effect a junction with rid s importance
 and had been the capital of force which consisted mostly of halfthe north west territories until 1883 breeds poundmaker moved
 out of his camp at cut knife as quietly as possible after hearing the news of the battle and passed
 well south of battleford no we advanced with greater caution than doubt colonel otter got news of this ever and
 were very careful in forming move but he made no effort to interour corrals and putting strong guards on cept
 poundmaker before the chief found duty when we halted the very tempting prize of our good wagon train loaded with
 supplies on maker visited us in the tent and shook the trail in front of him hands with each of
 us and assured us through an interpreter that our lives the teamsters quickly unhitched the would be spared poundmaker was
 teams which were inside the corral and handsome man and wore a blanket and most of us got busy throwing
 the sacks feathers he had remarkable control of oats bacon and other supplies to the and influence over his people
 everyground where each man used them to one jumped to attention when the chief build up his own little fort
 and get down appeared and no one ventured to disbehind with his snyder rifle and twelve pute his orders rounds
 of ammunition ready to fight it out however some teamsters thought the morning after we were captured it was useless
 for the few of us to try poundmaker and all of his people halfto fight the large hostile band breeds
 crees stoneys squaws and children with our teams and wagons and a fellow irish teamster next to me their own
 horses and cattle carts wagsaid for god s sake johnny don t ons dogs and travois moved off east shoot
 or we ll all be kilt in a great loose mob with an advance then a big half breed well
 dressed guard of about 400 mounted warriors in front the rest were spread out over and wearing baggy riding breeches
 dis the open plain to a considerable width mounted and approached our corral but kept fairly close to the bluffs
 so as throwing his rifle on the ground and to be ready to take cover in case of atholding his
 hands above his head he tack there was much galloping and called out don t shoot and asked our shouting
 by those in the main body of leader to come out and talk to him our the column we prisoners
 were forced wagon boss went out and in a few mm to drive teams and wagons utes came back and
 said if we surrendered our lives would be spared meanwhile general middleton having decisively defeated riel s main force a
 few of our young fellows jumped at batoche and taken riel and his prinon their horses and tried to gallop
 off cipal leaders prisoner embarked on the but a heavy fusilade of shots from the steamer northcote with as many
 indians forced them back to the corral troops as the boat could carry he mov on hearing what the wagon
 boss had ed slowly upstream with the object of to say we agreed to surrender and were re inforcing otter

 precious supplies by deal with the situation at fort pitt the large mob of half breeds and indians where general
 strange had fought an to poundmaker s camp in a small valley indecisive battle with big bear at not far
 off our captors promptly took frenchman s butte from us our watches and rings on the after moving east for
 about a week way a bunch of indians whom we poundmaker received a demand from heard were stoneys galloped up
 and general middleton that he go to battlewanted to shoot us but the half breeds ford and surrender we learned
 of this refused to allow this and showed fight when poundmaker s people as he thus saving our lives called
 his column turned around and moved back west as we entered the indian camp we were greeted by jeers and
 insults from we prisoners were taken in wagons the squaws who came out to rejoice which moved as fast as
 possible to over the capture that had been made battleford here i met my uncle micky we knew they were
 insulting us al shera who was sergeant in the winnithough we did not understand the lan peg rifles the famous
 little black guage many shouted for the men to devils we were returned by wagon kill us we were put
 into a tent and over the same trail across the south closely guarded night and day the saskatchewan river at
 saskatchewan enemy had our teams and wagons and landing to swift current where we helped themselves to the food pound
 were discharged from the service the edmonton hunt by frederick c jamieson i am using the name edmonton hunt to
 mean the buffalo hunting expeditions in spring and fall by the metis people of the settlements of edmonton lac ste
 anne st albert and lac la biche perhaps i ought to say that my remarks will especially concern the buffalo
 hunters town tail creek there were no more such expeditions after 1877 when the herds suddenly disappeared from the great
 plains of rupert s land some herds were still in southern montana in the early eighties and commercial killing continued
 there i have fortunately been able to get its existence what might be called the stories from a few old
 timers who re left hand division went south and west member these edmonton hunts and tail far into dakotas if
 necessary to find creek town the unpredictable herds the right hand division went west roughly parallel to the edmonton hunt

 only a hunters outpost and indeed disappear d artigue writes ed soon after the great herds were gone in the
 account of my first journey to from the nearby plains at the end of the plains we have seen that
 in the 1877 all were gone from alberta but a region of red deer river buffaloes were very numerous and

 about the middle of october the the indians indian and half breed hunters began to arrive the former having no
 carts then follows an account of the trip but using their squaws whom they on which they strayed to the

 dogs to transport their that at this time a non commissioned baggage as for the half breeds they carried their

 supplied ings only whose walls are made of with wood and water they felled some logs placed one above another

 and the with poles placed in rows and covered other for a stable are surrounded by with hay and earth
 holes were cut in a stockade made of stakes as for the the walls for doors and windows the third

 was constructed with unburn ment ed bricks composed of hay and mud and the floor formed with hewn logs a
 big house was built for meetings completed the carpenter work this and dances the floor was made from done they
 plastered the crevices well rough lumber made by the rip saws so with mud and the cabin was ready for
 were doors other floors were made of occupation the ease with which they hewn logs the cabins were built close
 are constructed and the wanderings of game will account for the number together like a street this plan presumof these
 cabins to be found throughout ably was the idea of the metis who came the north west from red river
 who saw streets in win the surroundings of fort tail creek nipeg were soon occupied by three or four mrs
 callihoo says hundred persons and night was made hideous by the deafening cries and i was about 15 years old
 when our powwows of the indians and the no caravan which comprised the people less discordant screeches of the violins
 from lac ste anne big lake and st of the half breeds who vied with the albert settlements were caught
 in indians in turning our hitherto peace the worst blizzard i ever experienced ful valley into a very bedlam as
 my mother had all the meat hides and pemmican she wanted she was the tail creek winter town was pro
 anxious to come back home to lac ste bably started by people from the settle anne now that the weather
 was getting cold the leader solway and a ments near edmonton who were not few families from our settlement and
 much interested in their small farms outfits from the other settlements where they had grown gardens and pat wanted to
 hunt and kill more buffalo ches of barley and preferred to stay claiming that more good weather would come and
 would not allow anyout near where the unpredictable herds one to leave the caravan saying any would likely to be
 found when the small outfit would fall easy prey to spring came again to the great plains of marauding indian
 tribes my mother rupert s land however there is cvi and my brother alexis were determined to come home as
 they knew dence that the population was greatly it was not likely there would be any and rather suddenly increased
 when an blackfeet tribe on the way home at early and great storm and a deep fall of that time
 of year snow in the fall of 1874 caught many of hot words were used when we left the hunters
 out on the plains and caused the caravan my mother said to them them to struggle to tail creek where
 â you people are foolish to stay here they built themselves shelters with any longer it is late in the
 season you will be snow bound and you have black poplar logs alongside the houses no wood to burn it
 was bitter cold built in previous winters on the way back i thought of my little home more than once
 even if it was it appears that tail creek was a small only a bark roof house with a mud
 settlement prior to 1874 composed of stove in one corner it was warm anyhunters mostly from red river who way
 apparently came when the bison was ice was forming on the river saskatchewan which was forded just begetting scarce in
 the red river country low where the high level bridge now they had brought tools such as shovels stands and
 my brother armed with a broadaxes two man rip saws augers sharp pointed pole rode above stream etc also stoves
 during the early win to shove off ice cakes from the carts in fear that the ice might upset them
 ter of 1874 lac ste anne hunters were after fording the stream we found caught on the plains and went
 to tail the ground was frozen and the grade creek for shelter after the storm many was steep and very
 slippery i think of them stayed at tail creek and dur it was the durochers of st albert who were
 stuck on the hill just about ing a fine indian summer built houses where the high level bridge now for
 their families there stands my father had come as far as big lake to meet us wondering what some of
 the hunters who lived there kept us out on the plains so long before this were baptiste veness ed during
 the winter we heard that the hunters we left behind were in an aw aunt and her children and mother
 ful plight they were snow bound and bought lumber whipped sawed and had to dig out their carts burn some
 got coffins made they were all buried of them for fuel and also teepee and at st albert my father
 hearing of tent poles were burned for wood we this terrible sickness that had fallen were told that they even
 had to burn on us met us at st albert we were tallow and sun cured meat for fuel greatly
 consoled when we saw him the hunting caravan did not return without exaggeration fully fifty peras a whole to their
 settlements they cent of the metis and seventy five were reported to have gone to a percent of the indians
 succumbed to creek where there were logs from small pox in the seventies which to build houses for the winter
 some of these families never returned the blackfeet tribe was the worst to the settlements where they belong enemy of
 the crees and yet lots of ed but lived out there at tail creek words of their language were identical
 with the cree dialect only with dif one of these hunts was associated ferent meanings skirmishes were frewith tragedy all
 my sisters brothers quent between the two tribes each and i went along with our mother then tribe possessed about
 as many scalps to the plains for the hunt we heard as its adversary according to the old about a
 disease on our way out not hunters knowing its dreadfulness we moved on the bison were getting further the blackfeet
 also stole horses from south the journey was now two days the metis but the latter always got longer than
 usual father stayed home them back they learned to respect tending the chores and gardening the the metis the latter
 had flint lock small crop we had peop le began to muzzle loaders and could outsmart act sick before the
 herd was caught the blackfeet who had only bows and up but no deaths had occurred when arrows on one
 occasion the blackfeet the chase camp was set the sickness were ready to pounce on the metis engot worse people
 dying fast the ill campment when a large flock of ness started with a fever some people geese flew over
 the metis they shot not knowing how to treat small pox down a big number when the blackwould wade in
 the water these never feet saw this they said when they survived towards fall when nights can shoot down flying
 birds what were frosty the plague got worse for chance have we let us leave them people did not stay
 in bed as they alone from now on they never bothwould now innoculation was unknown ered the metis after that
 almost everyone caught it young and old families were wiped out my peter hodgson of callihoo told me aunt and
 four children died from his father and his family stayed three small pox her husband was thrown winters at a
 camp on a piece of land from a horse on a buffalo hunt and was killed from the fall in
 the north east angle of buffalo lake and about 35 miles north east of the my mother never caught the
 sick mouth of tail creek his father built ness although she worked day and night attending the sick and slicing
 there a good log cabin he did not hunt the meat riders would tell of seeing but his two eldest
 brothers were old enteepees full of dead these were crees ough to hunt about 20 years of age and blackfeet
 this was the saddest sometimes they had to hunt in winter hunt no horse races no merriment only death a
 pall fell on the people they rode horses but used flat sleighs some of the corpses were buried there instead
 of carts and took teepees made on the plainsothers were brought of tanned buffalo hides the horses were home those
 buried out were wrapped turned loose in winter but were watchin cotton we always had cotton with us to make
 dresses and shirts we got ed he said he went past the tail creek the material from the hudson s
 bay camp several times he did not think company a hide would be wrapped there were 400 houses there were
 a around the body and it was then bur good many but not as many as in the ied in
 a shallow grave we had spades a roman catholic priest would al camp where his family lived the huntways accompany
 the hunting trips ers usually went to the winter camp providing for the spiritual needs of when the snow began
 to fall a priest the metis his vehicle had four wheels had a house in that camp and was the
 first four wheeled vehicle i saw he was provided with food by saddles were made of the buffalo the people
 father lacombe father hides and stirrup leathers were made andre and father lestanc were the of the same said mrs
 callihoo priests who took part in the hunts iron stirrups were bought by some we brought back the bodies of
 my hunters this interior view of a metis home was made in 1874 by artist henri julien who accompanied the
 north west mounted police on their westward trek before the buffalo disappeared hun there they abandoned it as there was
 dreds of dead ones were seen on the not enough power and they then went plains people said they died
 of black down the sturgeon river about two leg i once saw a long horned steer miles below st albert
 and built a with the buffalo i heard that one dam father blanchard was in charge man tried to kill
 him but he was too for a long time metis from lac ste fast anne went there and got their
 barley lac ste anne was the first metis ground it made black flour but it was nourishing sam cunningham a
 settlement and for many years was much respected metis was the first the metis capital of the upper sas member
 of the north west council for katchewan valley as st albert grew st albert lac ste anne got smaller most
 of the ambitious men went to st albert mrs gibbons wife of james gibbons to try farming after the buffalo
 hunt who came across the mountains in 1862 ing days were over most of the white settlers at st albert
 were french to prospect and wash gold on the sas the st albert settlement was known katchewan river was also
 interviewed as big lake settlement among the j w sherwin and i called on her she metis it is not
 as old as lac ste is 91 years old at her small farm south anne most of the settlers here
 of capitol hill she says she went with were from lac ste anne who came to her husband on several
 trips to tail st albert when father lacombe built the mission there also some came up creek when he went
 there to trade the from the red river when the mission log houses were close together in the would get
 their freight from there woods along the creek these people did during the summers the mission not do any farming
 and the place was taught school french and english french predominating really a buffalo hunters winter camp they also started
 farming at the mis buffalo lake was so called because sion they were rich and had oxen it was shaped
 like a buffalo with and farm implements they started a tail creek the outlet of the lake into grist mill
 on a creek that ran through the red river being the tail said my son bill s farm the dam
 is still mrs gibbons if general steele says falo hunts they got all their food and clothing from the store
 some of the hunters made annual trips to winnipeg to trade they took hides pemmican dried meat and marrow they
 were the envy of the other settlers when they came back with new things they would also bring back some
 of their relatives with them the horses which were used to run the buffalo had to be the swiftest and
 most sure footed available inferior animals could be used to haul the red river carts made in the settlements mrs
 callihoo says that the metis were able to get some good horses from the blackfeet there were 400 log cabins
 in january 1875 he may have been right there were a lot of cabins and probably the people then there
 told the police there were this number of houses twice every year the people of the lac ste anne settlement
 and a few from big lake and edmonton went out to the great plains to hunt buffalo they crossed the
 saskatchewan river at the ford below the fort and went south and east through the wooded country past hay lake
 to the open plains usually beyond the north bend of the battle river in the five years before the police
 came to edmonton a few people squatted on land near the river at edmonton both opposite the fort and in
 the lower settlement east of the hudson s bay company s reserve mrs gibbons thought that jane and william inkster
 went out with the hunt and probably some of the rowlands and gullions from the lower settlement r r moore
 deputy minister of economic affairs had some enquiries made last year but found that not much is now known in
 the country surrounding tail creek as to this interesting oldtime hunters winter town however j g morris of that department
 reported that a fire had swept the tail creek district in 1898 about 20 years after the last of the
 great herds had vanished the hon frank oliver described the early metis settlements in his founding of edmonton settlements were
 established at lac ste anne and lac la biche partly because of abundance of white fish being available at these
 lakes partly also because being in the woods they were safe from blackfeet raids while near enough to the plains
 to permit of excursions being made in both winter and summer after buffalo meat as the half breed population increased
 the st albert settlement was established it lacked the fish of st anne but it had the beautiful farming and
 on which potatoes and barley could be easily grown it was much nearer and more convenient to the plains and
 the buffalo than ste anne the settlers were numerous enough to defy the blackfeet in the late 70 s the
 st albert settlement had grown to be the largest in the saskatchewan country and numbered 800 people the edmonton settlement
 was the smallest of these settlements it included only employees of the hudson s bay company who lived in this
 settlement most of the men worked for the big store and some of them had come up the river from
 the east with steam boats wood burning steam boats started in the early seventies to come up the saskatchewan river

 searth fort whoop up and the whiskey traders by gerald l berry there are at least two generally recognized reasons
 for the movement of the liquor and fur traffic northward from montana to alberta in the late sixties the discovery
 of gold in montana had resulted in unrest among the indians the blackfoot tribes were driven north of the marias
 river where they stayed and the traders naturally followed them numbers of young men came west following the civil war
 no doubt with the same restlessness that marks every generation following a major conflict a new york manufacturer had discovered
 that buffalo hides not only made excellent coats and robes but also could be tanned into a very tough and
 durable leather suitable for industrial machinery belts so the demand for them was insatiable therefore the montana traders including these
 young veterans seeking adventure pushed more deeply into the buffalo and indian country gerald l berry ma was superintendent of

 and tive wishes to express its deep apprecia this is as it should be for the alberta tion of the
 splendid reception given its historical society is a province wide orfirst number of the alberta historical ganization our thanks are
 especially review requests for membership in due to certain historically minded inthe historical society which includes dividuals who of their
 own volition and subscription to our new quarterly have unselfish enthusiasm have gone out and been literally pouring in and
 the executive is encouraged to hope that a real canvassed their communities on behalf need is being met letters have
 reached of the society and its new venture the horse in alberta by percy r talbot when i first undertook
 the work of gathering material on thoroughbred horses of early days in what is now known as alberta i had
 in mind the securing of pictures of the thoroughbred horses that came here 40 or 50 years ago anyone who
 has been in this section of the country for that number of years will look back with a feeling of
 pride to the type of horse that was used by the north west mounted police in the early days however
 those who have come here in more recent years doubt the statements of persons who have seen the class of
 horse to which i refer it was therefore with the idea in mind of showing the pictures of these horses
 and comparing them with those of horses now here or ones of recent type and conformation that i understood the
 task in addition to this i also wished to from the united states the owner being obtain the names of
 those horses as well james christie who later resided in as something relative to their breeding calgary he sold these
 animals to the at the commencement i decided to take mounted police and the few white only the animals that
 came to the coun settlers who were in the country at that try prior to 1890 my reason for taking
 time christie was a former hudson s this particular year was that there were bay employee having worked for that
 many who could collect and compile company in 1869 data pertaining to the numerous thoroughbreds of a later date in
 a much in 1881 the cochrane ranch was esmore capable manner but i believe that tablished west of calgary and
 6000 head i should assume some responsibility in of cattle and 300 head of horses were collecting the earlier material
 as i per purchased in montana and driven on sonally knew many old timers who to the cochrane range in
 bringing these could supply the information you will animals mr cochrane rode the thorrealize that it is very difficult for
 many ougbred horse konrad from fort benold timers to look back 45 or 50 years ton to the site of
 the new ranch this and try to recall names and dates for animal is therefore the first thoroughthe material i
 wanted and i soon found bred horse of which we have any rethat as regards to pictures i could only
 cord to come into this province obtain a few of the kind i wanted i have been informed by several
 men i find that there is information on who are in a position to know that the record where a
 man named john glenn first thoroughbred they can remember owned a band of horses in 1874 just between calgary and
 standoff was one south of where calgary now stands but brought in by the north west cattle i have reason
 to believe that they were company and put on their ranch west composed entirely of native bred horses of high
 river in the year 1885 this is i also understand that in 1871 david and now known as the bar
 u ranch at john mcdougall of morley established that time the manager was f s stima herd of 50 horses
 at that point with son the records that we have would the idea in mind of improving the class indicate
 that this horse was registered of horse in alberta and in the following in the name of terror it is
 stated that year they purchased an additional 50 he stood nearly 16 hands and weighed head in the state of
 montana about 1200 lbs some of this horse s colts were of high quality and raced at fort the first
 band of horses brought to macleod and calgary some years later alberta for sale or trade arrived in 1876 it
 is interesting also to note that one dr percy r talbot was for many years provincial veterinarian and wrote with
 authority on the subject of the horse his paper first appeared in the alberta historical review vol 1 no 2
 july 1953 one of the most famous horses in alberta was eagle plume seen here with joe whitbred in 1893
 at the quorn ranch terror colt was later sold to go to plume yorkist and grand coup england he was
 entered in a steeple of the four animals eagle s plume chase there and came in second in corn was
 outstanding he was not only atpetition with 22 other horses tractive and beautifully tempered but left many descendants that became

 horse business this horse that a large number of the flourished considering the difficult con north west mounted police horses
 were ditions that existed at that time and descended various ranchers started to import horses from great britain in 1889
 they again imported two the quorn ranch established in 1883 horse novalis and preston grange situated between calgary and high

 to this coun grange and remembered by old timtry several outstanding thoroughbred ers was his mean disposition and it was

 would be the pastoral care realized that their awful distress was of the people the bishop of montreal 31 called
 for volunteers and i was the can tance from the shack and to visit it we didate finally chosen often
 had to plunge through a raging blizzard in the autumn of the first year my wife and i left one
 of the best we were there i contracted a virulent appointed church fabrics in the eastern type of typhoid fever
 and spent ten townships of quebec and started on our terrible weeks in bed several men of long journey with
 the blessing of the the colony died at that time of the same bishop his parting injunction was go fever
 on one occasion my wife went west young man and do your best the on a hike taking our little
 daughter great rocky divide that separates east with her to visit a homesteader s wife cnn and western canada frightened
 us who had just come from england and what rugged desolation is that great was desperately lonely the husband natural
 barrier when we came out on had gone on an errand into the settlethe prairie west of winnipeg we were

 of flat brown land to this city the young bride became hysterical day i believe with the poet that nature
 with fright and compelled my wife to is red in tooth and claw and that all take her to her
 husband by the time depends on man being strong enough they reached the settlement they were to redeem the situation
 both hysterical and that night my wife we were given a most cordial wel gave birth to a premature baby

 we were boy was our only son the pioneer escorted to a little shack sixteen by pays the price twenty

 signed deacon of the diocese of saskatchewan by practically every adult of the colony and from then on most of
 the time he was forwarded to ottawa asking that was absent from the settlement eventthe post office be named after
 their be ually he became bishop of the diocese loved leader mr lloyd and so lloyd and laboured unceasingly in
 pioneer minster will remain for all time a mem work until he retired and went to reside onial to a
 great and gallant leader in victoria where he passed away a few years ago there is an old saying the

 this into western parlance these city people from england could the pioneer pays the price we arriv adapt themselves to
 a completely new ed in the colony a little late for the real environment and by patient labour do test
 but nevertheless we experienced a so well for example james hill who few hardships we would waken up had been
 a farrier in woolwich togethduring the night and find the bed er with his three sons came out with clothes
 frozen to the wall we had a the colony he built his little log cabin little quebec heater which was
 so small near a lake and between the cabin and that to get any heat you had to sit be
 the lake he spaded the soil and sowed side it and feed it with poplar logs con some choice hand
 picked specimens of tinuously you could not keep on doing english abundance oats for three this all night and the
 moment the logs years he continued patiently to cull out burnt down everything in the shack and sow these oats
