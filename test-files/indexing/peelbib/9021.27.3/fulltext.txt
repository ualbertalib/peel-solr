 have been the coldest ever recorded at edmonton the thermometer went lower and remained low longer than it ever did
 since the government observatorywas first established here in 1879 there is every indication that the cold spell is now at
 an end as this morning the sky is clear the sun is warm and a light breeze is blowing from
 the south a few remarks in regard to the recent experience may be in order in the first place it
 is not remarkable that with an unprecedentedly severe winter the world over with people freezing to death in the southern
 states there should be exceptionally severe weather here in the next place it may be pointed out that the severe
 weather has not lasted as long as in most other localities forthe greater part of january was the most mild
 and pleasant winter weather that could be imagined in the third place the cold had none of the unpleasant features
 of high winds or drifting snow or sleet which in other parts of the world make winter terrible and against
 which no preparation is sufficient to ensure safety much less comfort the whole question of comfort or discomfort or it
 may be said danger depended simply on the preparations which had been made with warm clothing good buildings and plenty
 of fuel all of which are easily attainable here there was no danger and no discomfort the roads were good
 the sky bright the days and nights clear and people could go any where and transact almost any sort of
 business without hindrance although people travelled here or there wherever their business led them during the whole of the cold
 spell no one was frozen very few were seriously frost bitten and no one needed to have been it is
 in such cold spells as we have just passed through that the advantages of this district show up prominently the
 abundance of wood which enables people to build good houses and good stables which provides plenty of fuel and which
 prevents the sweep of the wind is an advantage which cannot be over estimated as compared with the treeless regions

 lee ment appeared to have a better understanding of rural opinion than the ufa executive priestley noticed during visits to
 rural areas that there was some anxiety over the exact nature of the ccf land policy but believed this to
 have been aroused by the legislative opposition and the press reports which could be overcome by careful exposition of the
 ccf ideals above all he felt keenly that the success of the ccf in canada rests to a great degree
 upon the action taken by yourself brownleej and the alberta legislature pointing to the bold innovative example set by american
 president rooseve t there was no direct answer but the premier implied a certain impatiencewith ufa tactics in a letter
 primarily addressed to another issue he regretted that the press and political organizations were so quick to capitalize on differences
 between the ufa executive and the provincial government but added 1 think i have suggested on one or two previous
 occasions that the situation could be met to some extent if on matters that come within the provincial jurisdiction our
 viewpoint could be placed before your executive before action is taken he was quite sure the government had the best
 sources of information on which to base policy decisions premier john e brownlee above sensed that alberta farmers had doubts
 about the ccf program particularly the nationalization of land although the government ignored them ufa officials went ahead with the
 affiliation on feb 18 executive committees of the ufa and the alberta section of the canadian labour party met in
 the ufa central office in calgary to establish the provincial council of the ccf with priestley as chairman and elmer
 roper president of the alberta labour party as secretary seeking to enlist the government s active support the ufa executive
 resolved to arrange a conference in the near future with brownlee to discuss the relationship of the ufa to the
 ccf 25 if such a conference did take place it was not recorded while ufa backbenchers in the legislature remained
 ambivalent on the subject of the ccf the labour members actively promoted the cause to the acute embarrassment of the
 government a resolution by c l gibbs edmonton labourite in favour of the socialist order was at first stood over
 for government study before it should come up for debate then evaded before it could come to a vote the
 govern during the spring and summer of â€˜ 1933 priestley and other writers filled the j f a columns with
 dissertations protesting that the ufa land policy admittedly somewhat rephrased in ccf publicity envisioned not the confiscation of farmers land
 but the provision for the farm people of a maximum of security these statements were justified by the appearance of
 the ccf manifesto framed during the first ccf convention at regina july 19 21 1933 the agrcuitural concern of the
 ccf was to obtain security of tenure for farmers by sociai control of the financial system extension of cooperative marketing
 and consumer organizations scientific agricultural development and establishment of import and export boards to coordinate foreign trade with domestic requirements
 ironically no mention whatever was made of social ownership and control of the one natural resource land privately owned in
 part by a group the ccf hoped to attract june and july were the months in strated regularly since 1921
 but it had which ufa provincial constituency as been muted in terms of any requests for sociations held their conventions

 beaver lake were out hunting about ten miles east of mr whitford s place on the east side of beaver
 lake they came upon a ruined shanty in the woods with a cart standing near it the shanty roof had
 been crushed in by some trees fafling on it on looking inside the doorthe boys saw an eight shooting rifle
 and a shot gun some kettles and other utensils where the ridge pole of the roof had fallen down they
 noticed what appeared to have been a bed but did not examine it fearing that it might contain the remains
 of a human being the accident to the shanty had evidently occured a number of years ago and no living
 person had been near the place afterwards they took the guns and reported the matter to their father f w
 w fane j p was informed of the affair and went outto investigate the shanty was supposed to have been
 built by a white man who passed by mr whitford s house in the fall of 1888 driving a horse
 and cart and turned off from the lake at that point he had passed the previous winter near beaver lake
 wolfing and it was supposed that he intended to pass the winter of 1888 9 in the same way he
 had formerly worked on a survey party in the vicinity of beaver lake and his name was known by some
 of the residents there in 1889 a large bay horse with a bell on his neck was found by indians
 south of battle river and was supposed to have belonged to the wolf hunter but the man was never seen
 or heard of after he left the vicinity of whitford s in the fall of 1888 whether he was killed
 by the falling of the roof of the shanty and has ain there unburied all the years since or died
 while away from his shanty or left the country without taking his property with him will probably be decided by

 kinda took to keep the skeeters away sure brought pity on this skinny kid from the east for tears to
 my eyes it was hard to tell which they hired me with no questions asked was worse the skeeters or
 the smoke curly staked me to some denims and curly whowasstill worrying aboutour other gear he told me i d
 need out on the boss jim decided to ride back down the range it was here i bid goodbye to
 my trail maybe i ll have to go all the way to derby for curly intimated that a stetson town
 butyou llbeokayhere kid hetold would look better to the cows me as he mounted the buckskin and lop late that
 afternoon curly and i headed ed away in the evening dusk out of town and up the dusty trail along
 the south saskatchewan river with a huddled down by the glowing fire embers i was a mighty lonely kid as
 the wagon piled high with camp gear and night shadows crept down into the valley groceries i felt small out
 there in that i felt small and lost in the immensity of it mighty expanse of hills and rolling all
 even the stars looked unfriendly and prairie but felt an exhilaration too for farawayupthereintheheavens sounds amid that clean air and
 its wind blown unfamiliar to an easterner s ears came in tang of sage i had visions of a new

 waded the shallows calling to his mate ever do any riding kid enquired the lonesome song of the coyote as
 he curly as he dexterously shook some roamed the moonlit cutbank i felt a little loose tobacco out of his
 little white sack homesick too as i crawled into the blankand rolled it into a wisp of brown paper ets
 under the wagon one s first night only rode bareback on my grand alone out on the lone prairie can
 conjure father s horses butl sure want to learn up a multitude of thoughts and fears we ll fix you
 up with a saddle when we sleep came reluctantly only to be brokget to the ranch got about 80 miles
 to go en by something rustling slightly among jim ought to catch up with us by dusk at the piled
 gear and oat sacks where i had the camp along the river bunked down rattlesnakes curly had i noticed that
 curly seemed a little wor been telling me about them during the ned about leaving jim back there in town
 afternoon drive with a frenzied scramble alone i came out from under the wagon losing we travelled north rattling along
 for a little hair and hide as my head came in about 12 miles then i helped curly make contact
 with the wagon undergear the camp on a site close to the river s edge rest of that night i
 slept in the wagon box here we unharnessed the team and led amid the flour and potatoes them to water
 then hobbled them and junedawncomesearlyinalberta cool turnedthemloosetograzethedun color and fresh wisps of fog linger in the coued dry looking bunch
 grass and prairie lees and river bottoms a bunch of antewool i wondered why curly had tied his lope down
 at the water s edge stood saddle horse to a wagon wheel and fed eying my tousled head as i
 peered at him a few oats and on asking was told them from the camp wagon several that an old
 cowman sure hates to get left long horned lanky steers came down a â€˜ â€˜ we crossed the red deer
 river at the old buffalo ford i was a bit scared as i followed jim and curly across the water
 draw but wild eyed on spotting the if we get an early start tomorrow we camp they turned and were
 away on the should be at the buffalo ford on the red lope deer river come sundown was the last
 there was no sign of curly or jim so i comment i heard jim make as i snuggled figured they

 i d sneak a handful of sugar his way trying to say thank you you big devil i soon had
 a horse and saddle an old cowpony named jay flag on account of his brand many the blister i raised
 as i trailed along with curly or some of the other riders when helping the boys to cut out steers
 something jay flag knew more about than i he d run and turn on a nickel when some snaky steer
 broke loose this was exhilarating work but the old cowpony s unpredictable stops and turns as he closed in fast
 on the steers generally left me sitting up there in the air the author during his range riding days howl
 from the cook telling us to come and get it later down by the corral jim gave his riders orders
 for the day you boys circle down around the river and bring in any top steers red you and shorty
 gander up the creek and see how the cows and calves are doing snowdrop you tighten up them there shoes
 on the bay team and show the kid what chores to do left alone at the stables i watered jim
 s pet horse strawberry and several other saddle horses then noticing a big white percheron stallion nickering for attention i
 guessed he wanted watering too i managed to get into the high box corral although the stallion acted pretty nervous
 and jumpy he was prety tall so it took some talking to get the halter over his restless head and
 some fancy stepping to avoid getting walked on finally down to the waterhole we went the big snorting stallion on
 one end of the halter shank and a kid on the other the stallion whistled loud and clear now that
 he was filled with water we started back to the frying to avoid landing in the cactus i sure got
 some kidding from the riders when they brought my horse back branding too was rough on the bones the ropers
 would snake a calf in close to the branding fire generally a couple of us would wrestle that husky twisting
 chunk of baby beef trying to hold it while that hot iron sizzled its hide flying hoofs and stub horns
 sure played havoc on a boy s frame if he didn t hold tight but it was learning anyway the
 tales the boys told me about rattlesnakes kept me a bit nervous and jumpy and wary of the bunch grass
 and juniper shadows coming out of the bunkhouse one day i almost stepped on a big venomous looking snake as
 he wiggled from underthe doorsill ijumped about six feet into the air hollering rattlesnake get a gun somebody curly coming
 out behind me laughingly informed me it was only dusty pet bull snake and when he s around we d
 see no ornery rattlers for he corral ambling peacefully along with him pretty close to my ear and snorting down
 the back of my neck looking up i spotted jim snowdrop and the cook intently watching us with a look
 of deep concern iwaved nonchantly kills emoffforus thuslbecamefriends mean to hold when the bulldog flies hit with dust y and
 often got the odd mouse â€˜ grumbled curly if we can make for him the cook tolerated him but sounding
 creek by nightfall the dogies grumbled a lot about the eggs missing will be okay they re mightydryalready down at
 the stables where he kept the miles of sandhills and rolling terrain ranch hens seemed to merge into the distant

 i proceeded back to my seat lunch kits were not considered they were and my initial experience was over thank
 for the well to do jam as such was a goodness luxury and for special occasions only i remember one

 from edmonton normal school things would go wrong because of cirafter a year of preparation for teaching i cumstances and
 because of my own unwas then 21 years of age and full of ideas certainity and enthusiasm as to how
 to be success in about half an hour i got through the ful as a teacher there was surplus of
 names on the school daily attendance teachers in alberta at that time and the register and had recorded the morning
 s question was whether or not i would be attendance i had to call out each name able to obtain
 a teaching position for individually and endeavour to relate the september name and face at that particular time the home
 school divisions were ex this task alone seemed formidable for pected to find positions generally in one there were 35
 pupils in all would the list room schools for their quota of normal never end in addition i had to
 obtain ites as we were called there were at separatelythenamesofthegradeonesleast six normalites to place by lamont sevenofthem asithappened thegrade school
 division no 18 and in august i ones were the heaviest grade and to add was advised that i was
 allocated to silver to the problems one girl was a repeater lake school no 1695 located three by this time
 i was in a frenzy i had not miles west and one mile north of ross done any teaching but
 was utilizing creek i would be both principal and energy trying to get the names straight teacher of a one
 roomed school with my confidence was beginning to wane pupils from grades one to eight i was and soon the
 pupils were fidgeting and relieved that i was not given my home starting to get restless i also noticed a
 school of limestone lake i suppose i finger or two pointing towards the thought that distance all value enhances teacher
 what was i doing wrong the next task was to list the texts and i succeeded in obtaining a boarding
 materials required for each grade this i place at a farmer s residence one and a proceeded to do by
 writing out labourhalf miles north of the school and on iously on the blackboard grade by grade sept 2 i
 started out early for classes it the list of books that would be needed in would not do for the
 teacher to be late on the course of the year although i had thefirstday lwasarmedwithmostofthe attended a one room school
 myself it required texts and materials plus the bothered me that a degree of talking was dept of education course
 of studies a going on as the pupils did not have anythick publication comprising about 200 thing in particular to
 do as no class work pages in addition i had the usual odds had yet been assigned by this time
 it and ends that any teacher requires for a was past ten o clock and the morning time indicator i
 had procured a westclox recess was only a half hour away in pocket watch selling for 1 75 desperation i
 dismissed the class for an the teacher s desk was located at the early recess but i did not breathe
 a sigh of back of the classroom while the rows of relief i had onlythree quartersof the day pupils desks
 both single and double left and i had not yet done any formal were towards the front i got out
 the pre teaching what would inspector a r vious year s register and proceeded to go gibson say if he
 dropped in on me over the names approximately half of worse luck i assumed that he would put the surnames
 were of ukrainian origin in an appearance the first day this could so far so good i thought i might
 even well bethe beginning ofthe end have a good day it was traditional and expected that in due course the
 pupils began to mathematics would be the first subject arrive most of them came directly into taught in the morning
 and it was so mdithe room and cast a curious and quizical cated on the teacher s time table so
 glance atthe newteacherwho was deep although i was at least one and a half ly involved or so it seemed
 at his desk in hours behind i proceeded to teach arithno time at all the westclox timer mdi metic starting
 with grade eightand going cated nine o clock it was the moment to down the line by the time i
 got to about ring the bell and start school i had made grade five or six it was 11 30
 a m and i detailed plans and nothing was expected had not commenced the subject matter to go wrong little
 did i realize that during for the second period so arithmetic had to end and the balance of the time
 until with the word this was another chore to noon was utilized with social studies for add to the list
 nevertheless this was the arades seven and eight and enterprise expected method it was stated so in the i or
 grades one to six i did not get too far course of studies i don t recall just how in
 either subject because of the limita much i taught that afternoon i do not tions of time however the introductory
 believe that they learned much and perremarks were made at that time the haps they were as bewildered as i
 was enterprise activity program was at the the afternoon recess was from 2 15 to zenith due largely to the
 philosophy of an 2 30 p m after that there would only be american educator john j dewey the one
 more hour to go by that time i had assumption was that pupils could learn my doubts as to whether
 i had chosen the by doing this procedure made learning right profession and harboured at least a more meaningful and
 the teacher was ex few doubts about my normal school trainpected to teach accordingly in the one ing the realities
 of teaching were quite room schools resources were limited so different from the idealistic picture that i many teachers resorted
 to buying had envisioned just a few months earlier ready made enterprises from the there were so many details to
 attend to western canada institute in calgary the andsomanysubjectstoprepareforthatit logical and easiest choices were the meant extra hours of preparation
 and indians and eskimos burning the midnight oil in this case a i ate my lunch in a hurry as
 the after coaloil lamp noon was looming ahead of me and i had not fully recovered from my morning i
 had no time for reflection as the final teaching experiences i don t remember period still had to be taught
 i recall that what subjects i tackled the first period of literature was assigned to grades seven the afternoon for
 by that time my mind and eight while in grades one to six i was near blank anyway it was
 a good struggled with language grades four thing that the pupils were not aware of five and six were combined
 using a text theteacher spredicament priortothis of authored by dr donalda dickie my norcourse there was the afternoon register mal
 school english instructor after some duty the calling of names and recording initial hesitation the lessons proceeded the attendance it
 seemed just a bit easier not too badly there was some hope yet the second time around during the after
 the class had settled down or so i noon i think that grades seven and eight thought and we had
 established some had science while grades one to six were rapport teaching did not seem that bad assigned reading but
 it was not that good either i was the reading series in the elementary conscious of many things that had
 gone grades were called highroads to read a gley but iconsoled myself with thefact ing the grade ones had a
 primer called that i would somehow overcome all the fun with dickand jane if it was fun for difficulties that
 i encountered on the first the pupils it was not so for the teacher day trying to keep his head
 above water finally 3 30 p m arrived and none too naturally the grade ones were not ready soon although
 i was young and enerfor the primer for they still had to be getic i felt completely drained would i
 taught word recognition we were strong recover for the next day after all there ly advised at norman school not
 to teach were three more teaching days before the the individual letter sounds or the phone weekend we sang god
 save the king nics initially forthe pupils would become and the pupils proceeded to go their word callers and not
 sentence readers respective ways immediately preparwhich was the desired end so the teach ations for the next day had to
 be made er had to prepare charts and pictures ie so i proceeded to write out the lessons in mother

 how as i was putting the saddle on him we ever that i did have to go easy with him
 both saw a horeseman coming swiftly for he was as soft as butter when we towards us and before long
 a former arrived at the foot of the two hills the school mate rode up on a pretty white sweat
 was rolling off him so instead of mare thisponywasknownasthefastest riding up i got down from the saddle and runner on
 the reserve bruce wanted to walked with the stallion by my side i play but the little mare was cross
 with noted though that his wind was good so him we started to lead our horses slowly i let him
 walk as fast as he wanted to the down the hill until we arrived at the road viewfromthetopofthathillwasmagnifi where my
 friend hit me up for a race to cient away out in the distance was which i promptly agreed we
 rode down frenchmen s butte where no doubt about a quarter of a mile where we bruce as a suckling
 colt had enjoyed to his dumped our saddles as we trotted along ittle heart s content the beauty of the

 when all of a sudden he oamed wheeled his horse around and with a closer in and a bit to

 you poor poor friend took big handfuls of grass and with east yonder beyond these far away it rubbed my

 a happy time together could i but ing horse passed the house and went up ay that you were my

 that night i ll wager also that the uietly grazing about a mile away to the poor horse often dreamed
 ofa pretty little outh and towards the saskatchewan mare who had tried vainly to run away from him the once
 proud head while he actually one wintry day in 1914 found my wife tried to kiss me i gently forced
 him back and me for i was now a married man while i opened the whole door and having dinner
 with my former boss at his walked into his dungeon he simply could new homefourmileswestof the old hud not have
 enough of rubbing me when i son s bay post from which he had recent eventually had to shut him
 in again he ly retired he had asked us to stop over on did not scream his protest as of
 old but our way home and since the place was his pitiful moan of despair sounded more not far from
 our regular route we were like the cry from a broken heart take me happy to comply the old gentleman

 a little diversion might do worse than turn their attention to the sport that mr copithorne is enjoying with his
 hounds round and about the jumping pond district amongst the coyotes three meets have already taken place and wenty one
 coyotes have passed over the border at the last meet eight coyotes were run down and killed the cast off
 was from mr healy s captain gardner coming over for the occasion from the elbow river with his wolf hounds
 to combine forces against the common enemy the hounds were worked up to mr goddard s fence and killed four
 coyotes before luncheon the last coyote yielding after a stubborn resistance in the home pasture after luncheon the western country
 was beaten and then home by shengler s shack with an addition of four more brushes somehow the coyotes did
 not appear to enjoy the process of partition from their caudal appendages and many of the hounds bore away with
 them mementoes of the fray in the shape of toothmarks during the earlier part of the day the cayuses may
 have had a bit the best of the running but the superior stamina of the larger horses told in the
 end and towards its close they were the more often to be seen ahead captain gardner road on ike and
 his plucky little mount held well on to the finish and often made it hard running for mr j h
 ellis blizzard which has now recovered from its accident but is of course out of condition mrs copithorne s brown
 horse that during the morning was in at each consecutive death unfortunately stumbled and lamed itself early in the afternoon
 thus placing it hors decombat mr copithorne as usual was on the track of the coyotes but his brother who
 was riding a young horse just broken did not care to let it out after the first two kills as
 excitement was getting the whip hand over it mr ted cook s clever little gladys showed up well in the
 morning obtaining the brush in the second run but disappeared with her owner toward the dinner hour as also did
 mr tom lusk who no doubt scented the burnt meats and savoury dishes of the bow river horse ranch from
 afar off it is to be deplored that many of the settlers who had promised their attendance did not show
 up but a bad excuse is betterthan none and they have already settled that theywill turn up en masse for

 on the continent of silence no one can know until he has experienced it the longing which takes possession of
 one who has been for weeks practically separated from speaking men once more to hear the sound of common life
 the roar of the city streets the sound of bells and even the crowing of the cock in the early
