 introduction historical accounts of medical research in canada almost inevitably begin with a proud reference to the isolation of insulin 
 at the university of toronto in 1921 22 the insulin discovery a dramatic triumph of science over dread disease had 
 powerful repercussions in the lives of those who were touched by it diabetics and their doctors suddenly gained a potent 
 tool in treating a deadly condition the canadian public 0:pub 0:lic was given a vivid demonstration that its medical scientists 
 could rank among the best in the world the subsequent burst of enthusiasm for medical research brought an infusion of 
 young investigators and funds to the field in the lives of its four discoverers frederick grant banting charles herbert best 
 john james rickard macleod and james bertram collip insulin wrought irrevocable changes banting best and collip all young men at 
 the time of the medical breakthrough found that the insulin discovery marked them for the rest of their lives these 
 three canadians would be regarded as being among the leaders of their country s medical research community for the next 
 several decades their careers were given an immeasurable boost because of the prestige they gained as scientific heroes but they 
 also benefited in a very material sense through their share in the substantial 0:sub 0:stantial insulin royalties perhaps most importantly 
 they became driven to live up to the mighty legacy of their early success banting and best are still synonymous 
 with the insulin discovery in the popular mind macleod along with banting won the nobel prize in recognition of his 
 role of the four discoverers the least known and celebrated is j b collip the shy intuitive biochemist who on 
 a late 
 introduction xii january night in 192 2 watched the first purified sample of insulin precipitate 0:pre 0:cipitate out of a 
 murky alcohol solution at that moment collip aged only twenty nine stepped into the forefront of canada s fledgling medical 
 0:med 0:ical research community in the early decades of the twentieth century medical research in canada could be pursued only 
 by a select few by mid century it had grown into a systematic large scale enterprise involving teams of professional 
 0:pro 0:fessional scientists and dozens of laboratories in universities government 0:govern 0:ment and industry j b collip skilled both as 
 a bench scientist and an entrepreneur of science represents a particularly successful part of this change his story gives us 
 some insight into the forces that transformed the landscape of canadian medical research thus far collip has received attention from 
 historians only in his connection with specific discoveries or with other figures in the history of medical science this biography 
 examines his career and his life as a whole 1 collip was a member of the first generation of medical 
 researchers 0:re 0:searchers to obtain a phd at a canadian university and then to pursue a successful research career within 
 the country his first major achievement 0:achieve 0:ment was to contribute to the isolation of insulin in 1921 22 the 
 definitive 0:de 0:finitive account of which is by michael bliss in the discovery of insulin 2 collip later went on 
 to important work on the parathyroid hormone the placental hormones and anterior pituitary hormones this biography also serves as an 
 exploratory study of the emergence of systematic institutionalized medical research in canada leaders of the emerging research enterprise during this 
 critical period faced several challenges how to balance laboratory and clinical interests in determining research programs how to raise funds 
 for experimental investigation 0:in 0:vestigation in an era before large scale government support of medical research how to respond to 
 the opportunities and demands posed by the commercial development of medical products and how to adapt the laboratory group to 
 the changing scale and character of experimental 0:experimen 0:tal work collip s success as a scientist and a scientific entrepreneur 
 lay in how he met these challenges he concentrated on basic research but remained 0:re 0:mained alert to potential therapeutic 
 applications he used his entrepreneurial 0:entre 0:preneurial skills to gain funding from private and commercial sources he collaborated closely with 
 pharmaceutical companies finally he gathered a group of associates and melded their diverse talents and disciplinary 0:dis 0:ciplinary training to 
 form an effective scientific team the story opens with an examination of the formative influences in collip s education and 
 early scientific work chapter 1 describes the undergraduate and graduate training collip received at the university of toronto under the 
 guidance of a b macallum an early proponent 
 introduction xiii of original investigation in the medical sciences the chapter continues with a discussion of collip s early career 
 as a professor at the university 0:univer 0:sity of alberta chapter 2 traces collip s experiences during the pivotal event 
 in his life the discovery of insulin its focus is on how the discovery affected collip s broader intellectual and 
 professional development chapter 3 examines the impact of the insulin discovery on collip s life and work the chapter continues 
 with a study of a priority dispute that developed over his next major accomplishment the preparation of an active extract 
 of the parathyroid hormone this episode reflects the tensions surrounding the professionalization of research in endocrinology 0:endocrinol 0:ogy and the 
 commercial development of medical products chapter 4 presents an analysis of collip s role in rebuilding the prestige 0:pres 0:tige 
 of mcgill university s faculty of medicine it examines his discovery 0:discov 0:ery and development of the placental hormone product 
 emmenin it elaborates on the theme developed in the previous chapter that while collaborative ventures with pharmaceutical firms were very 
 important to the support of collip s research enterprise they sometimes engendered 0:engen 0:dered conflicts with established codes of behaviour 
 in medical research the scientific content of collip s research work during his great years is examined in chapter 5 
 this chapter describes collip s activities 0:activi 0:ties as the head of a large team of researchers with a variety 
 of disciplinary 0:disci 0:plinary backgrounds a fortuitous configuration of personnel in the laboratory provided the set of skills necessary to 
 put collip s group in the forefront of a very competitive field of research collip s venture in developing the 
 theory of antihormones however was less successful than his work in manipulative biochemistry chapter 6 focuses on collip s struggles 
 to establish a research institute 0:insti 0:tute it follows the course of his failed application to the rockefeller foundation and 
 his negotiations with administrators at mcgill it concludes 0:con 0:cludes with an analysis of the reasons that collip s research 
 career finally 0:fi 0:nally came to an end chapter 7 contains a survey of the work of the national research 
 council s associate committee on medical research later renamed the division of medical research during the twenty years that collip 
 was associated with it it outlines the manner in which the federal government 0:gov 0:ernment gradually accepted responsibility for the 
 financial support of medical research and goes on to suggest the ways in which the experiences 0:experi 0:ences of collip 
 s own career are reflected in the policies and practices instituted during these years the biography concludes with a discussion 
 0:discus 0:sion of the broader implications of this study today discussions of medical science abound with terms like patents and 
 profits venture capital and private sector partnerships academic 
 introduction xiv scientists double as biotechnology entrepreneurs some might be surprised 0:sur 0:prised to know that this is by no 
 means new territory for canadian medical science and that some of its early pioneers far from being isolated 0:iso 0:lated 
 geniuses in ivy covered towers were quite adept at traversing this difficult terrain collip s story tells us much about 
 how large scale systematic government funding for medical research arose out of a patchwork of public and private funds now 
 half a century later when the commercialization of university research is the focus of increasing public scrutiny and the guidelines 
 delineating private rights and public responsibilities seem in need of greater clarification the lessons of this story are more pertinent 
 than ever

 j b collip and the development of medical research in canada 
 i the research ideal 1892 1920 i do not know whether i am unique in my feelings in this regard 
 but i think it must be a fair assumption that it is the personal satisfaction experienced by the researcher of 
 work accomplished and achievement that keeps him at his task irrespective of position or financial reward i think it to 
 be most important that the young man or woman undertaking a research career should be imbued very early with the 
 intense if not burning desire to extend the frontiers of knowledge and this should be his or her paramount thought 
 j b collip julyi9 4 8 i in the last decade of the nineteenth century the township of thurlow ontario 
 hummed with prosperity it was enviably situated atop finequality 0:fine 0:quality loam its landscape undulating and its climate agreeable the 
 river moira and its tributaries flowed through the township and then continued a short distance southwest towards the city of 
 belleville itself 0:it 0:self located midway on the main route between toronto and montreal a century before the area had 
 become home to united empire loyalists 0:loyal 0:ists seeking refuge in british north america after the american revolution 0:revolu 0:tion 
 an enterprising loyalist captain had set up the first saw and grist mills in the area and the small settlement 
 had soon become a trading centre for a burgeoning lumber industry by the time the lumber trade had begun to 
 fail in the 1870s discoveries of mineral troves in the north brought new money through town the grand trunk railway 
 and a regular steamship service helped to transport the bounty of this area its timber limestone and a variety of 
 agricultural products to other parts of the world while bringing back more and more hopeful newcomers 2 englishman james coe 
 collip was one of many immigrants drawn to belleville he married ellen mullens and in 1873 started a market garden 
 in the first concession of thurlow township just outside the city his son james denis collip grew up working alongside 
 his father 0:fa 0:ther gaining according to the local paper a thorough knowledge of everything pertaining to plant life 3 
 thus in his time the younger collip was able to build a thriving business he married mahala frances vance a 
 schoolteacher and a woman remarked upon for her 
 j b collip 4 determination and self reliance on 20 november 1892 their first child a son was born he 
 was named james bertram collip but was known throughout his life as bert bert was raised alone until he was 
 eight years old when his sister rita emily was born the age gap between 0:be 0:tween the siblings meant that 
 bert and rita grew up almost like single children we know little about bert s early years only snippets can 
 be drawn from family stories and photo albums during his youth bert often earned money by selling his grandfather s 
 produce from a horse and cart he is recalled as saying the last year before i went to college i 
 sold cabbages 4 we know he attended a one room country schoolhouse 0:school 0:house within walking distance of his home 
 and that later he went to belleville high school by the time bert had reached high school age his father 
 had become 0:be 0:come one of the principal florists in the area the elder collip had a salesroom at 265 
 front street belleville s main business thoroughfare 0:thorough 0:fare and two greenhouses in the second concession of thurlow according 0:ac 
 0:cording to belleville s daily newspaper he had a thriving trade in wholesale and retail supplying flowers and plants with 
 all the latest 0:lat 0:est ideas and designs throughout the area and surrounding districts 0:dis 0:tricts his greenhouses were equipped 
 with every convenience for raising all manner of flowers and bedding plants and he employed several workers and a travelling 
 salesman s the family s comfortable situation is suggested by a photograph of the teenaged bert proudly posing at the 
 wheel of a fine car lean and boyishly handsome this picture is a wonderful presage of collip s legendary and 
 lifelong love of the automobile bert showed no inclination towards the work of his father and grandfather instead he developed 
 an interest in chemistry and a desire to go to university this ambition was further fanned by a visit from 
 the provost of trinity college toronto trinity college was an anglican 0:angli 0:can institution that had only recently federated with 
 the university of toronto as the collip family belonged to the anglican church trinity was deemed an appropriate place for 
 bert s higher education in 1908 at the tender age of fifteen bert collip matriculated and entered the university of 
 toronto his mother was immensely proud of him and would tell her grandchildren in later years how much she had 
 taught him as a child how quick he had been to learn and how he had put on his first 
 pair of long pants to go off to university collip seems to have been all too happy to leave belleville 
 he would come to refer to his early days as his life in the country and even in his later 
 years he would be known for his aversion to rural living 6 
 the research ideal i 892 1920 5 i trinity college the trinity college that greeted bert collip was a bastion 
 of anglican tradition founded in 1852 by the bishop of toronto john strachan it had remained a staunchly anglican institution 
 in the years since then the college was built on queen street west of the city in order to keep 
 its students safe from dangerous urban influences by the time collip arrived at its venerable gates trinity had just survived 
 a period of considerable 0:con 0:siderable upheaval the college had given in to the financial realities of the new era 
 and had agreed to surrender its independence in order to federate with the university of toronto the university was situated 
 in the city at queen s park some two miles north and east trinity s location 0:loca 0:tion plans for 
 moving the college to the downtown campus were slow to gel however and so trinity would at least in a 
 physical sense remain 0:re 0:main in splendid isolation for another two decades in the fifty years since trinity had been 
 built the city had crept up to the edges of its grounds queen street bustled with the clop clop of 
 horse drawn streetcars taking people to and from the nearby asylum undertaker s parlour and candy factory pedestrians browsed in 
 foreignlanguage 0:foreign 0:language news shops and conducted their business in the long row of red brick stores on the north 
 side of the street stood trinity s imposing iron gate beyond which stretched a broad parkland an elm lined road 
 led to the main college building in massive yellow stone graced by gothic spires carved in the oxford style during 
 the summer trinity men in sharp whites played cricket on its lawns or lolled in the shady ravine to the 
 east most of the college men came from out of town and almost all resided 0:re 0:sided within trinity s 
 gates trinity took great pride in retaining its academic 0:aca 0:demic traditions long after the other colleges had discarded them 
 students were expected to wear academic gowns to their lectures during 0:dur 0:ing the day and to put on blazers 
 in the evenings a white surplice was added for chapel each morning attendance at chapel was compulsory for students and 
 dons alike and those who failed to appear could expect 0:ex 0:pect to find their names publicly displayed or even 
 to receive a personal note from the provost it was rumoured that sleepy eyed men sometimes 0:some 0:times managed to 
 make it to matins on time only by compromising their attire the provost found it necessary to issue a note 
 formally forbidding 0:for 0:bidding the wearing of pyjamas and slippers under one s gown the college buildings were resolutely victorian 
 their dusky stone corridors flickering with gaslight collip roomed in the upper corridor of the east wing with divinity student 
 harding priest each of the residential 0:resi 0:dential halls had a nickname and theirs was known as the angel s 
 roost for its preponderance of theology students in contrast the lower 
 j b collip 6 floors of the wing were famed for the sport of bottle rolling its denizens 0:deni 0:zens 
 delighted in tossing bottles from either end of a long corridor with the objective of creating the most explosive collision 
 possible collip and priest shared the typical student accommodations a small study attached 0:at 0:tached to a tiny room for 
 sleeping dubbed the coffin the rooms were heated by an open grate fire the coal for which was charged to 
 the students accounts frugal undergraduates would often forgo lighting 0:light 0:ing their fires until teatime and thus would have to 
 begin their winter mornings by cracking through the ice crusts formed on their wash basins 0:ba 0:sins many a passionate 
 discussion was held before the grate with faces deliciously warm and backs icy cold when trinity federated with the university 
 of toronto it gave up its degree granting status for all subjects but divinity many courses could be given at 
 the queen street location but those requiring modern laboratory facilities were given at queen s park only science students from 
 trinity took most of their courses at the main university spending 0:spend 0:ing hours each week riding the streetcars along 
 queen and then up mccaul bert blossomed at trinity while generally a shy person he gamely took part in many 
 college activities he competed in the tennis tournaments 0:tourna 0:ments and ran in the annual steeplechase on saints simon and 
 jude s day when the college literary society the lit held a mock trial he took the role of dr 
 collip and examined the witnesses for signs of insanity when trinity undergraduates held their annual secret episkopon ritual collip joined 
 in in this ceremony the spirit of the venerable father episkopon would be summoned to the dining hall where he 
 would mete out public censures for supposed faults as bert s interest in science grew he found a niche among 
 like minded students he founded the trinity science club in 19 11 with david keys and f m turner during 
 its early years the club had difficulty competing with the more established societies such as the lit and the glee 
 club but a small and active group of supporters persevered they gathered monthly in rooms of members to learn about 
 recent scientific findings or to have more broadly philosophical discussions about the place of science in the world in those 
 early years they heard papers such as the relation of science to literature and the new gas x 3 discovered 
 0:dis 0:covered by professor j j thomson and debated questions such as resolved that the study of science has no 
 other justification than the advancement of human welfare 7 in academic work collip also flourished bert had intended to study 
 medicine when he had first arrived in toronto but found that at fifteen he was too young to enter the 
 medical course instead he enrolled in the honours biochemistry and physiology program in doing so he entered 
 the research ideal 1 892 1920 7 i into a course of study that had few equivalents in north america 
 this program had been established in 1904 as a way of creating an elite stream of medical students trained in 
 methods of scientific research while high school graduates could enter medicine directly students in the b and p program first 
 earned an honours bsc in four years then completed two further years of study that also served as the first 
 two years of medical training the program was the legacy of robert ramsay 0:ram 0:say wright and archibald byron macallum 
 professors at the university of toronto historian sandra mcßae credits wright and macallum with bringing the research ideals of biology 
 to the study of medicine and building one of the most progressive pre clinical programs in north america the excellent 
 undergraduate honours program mcßae argues rivalled graduate programs in the united states in its rigorous training in original investigation in 
 1909 abraham flexner rated the laboratory facilities as being among the best on the continent 8 ramsay wright was the 
 chair of natural history and later of the department 0:de 0:partment of biology in the 1880s he built up an 
 active research program and cultivated a group of young research associates many of the graduates 0:gradu 0:ates of the toronto 
 program went on to become leaders in biological medicine in the united states including lewellys barker thomas cullen thomas futcher 
 william maccallum john b maccallum robert russell 0:rus 0:sell bensley frank lillie ralph lillie and maud menten a b macallum 
 was among those who studied biology under wright he went on to take a phd at the johns hopkins university 
 under the physiologist henry newell martin when he returned to canada he became one of the first to make a 
 career of experimental research in biology 0:bi 0:ology inspiring many of his own students to follow his example macallum developed 
 an active research program in general physiology 0:physiol 0:ogy and general biochemistry his studies were oriented towards evolutionary 0:evo 0:lutionary 
 questions and the application of chemistry to biological problems he was particularly concerned with fundamental processes such as growth energy 
 transformation and biochemical control macallum investigated the operation of these processes in a wide variety 0:vari 0:ety of life forms 
 preferring not to restrict himself to the special problems 0:prob 0:lems of human physiology and pathology in the 1890s he 
 and his associate robert russell bensley adapted chemical methods of analysis 0:analy 0:sis for use with the microscope these microchemical 
 techniques allowed 0:al 0:lowed them to determine the location of iron phosphorus and other materials in tissues and within cells 
 wright and macallum had both been active in opening the marine biological station of the biological board of canada in 
 1898 this gave them access to marine organisms for research purposes a fact that would shape macallum s work one 
 line of research that he pursued 
 j b collip 8 throughout his career was based on his early investigations of the concentration 0:con 0:centration of various 
 salts in the bodily fluids of jellyfish his observations 0:observa 0:tions led him to speculate that the plasma of animals 
 and plants reflected the composition of the ancient oceans from which life had first emerged that is that even after 
 organisms emerged from the seas they continued to bathe their cells in a solution resembling that in which they had 
 evolved he regarded plasma as a sort of living fossil record in the first decade of the twentieth century macallum 
 also pursued 0:pur 0:sued the question of how surface tension related to the active transport of solutes across membranes macallum 
 served as lecturer in biology from 1883 and then as professor of physiology after 1890 in 1908 the year collip 
 arrived in toronto the chair of physiology was split and macallum was made the first professor of biochemistry in canada 
 collip had the good fortune to become associated with macallum 0:macal 0:lum at this time it must have been a 
 heady experience for the young man coming from his country school to enter this flourishing intellectual 0:intel 0:lectual environment where 
 research was promoted with such zeal bert did well in his studies and in 19 iz graduated at the top 
 of his class macallum s message of the research ideal fell on fertile soil with this student as it had 
 with many others inspired collip decided to give up his plans for medicine and pursue graduate studies instead absorbing the 
 research ideal the university of toronto had established the first doctoral program in canada in 1897 mcgill followed with its 
 doctoral program only in 1906 while macallum was very successful in developing a strong research oriented undergraduate honours program he 
 was less successful 0:success 0:ful in promoting graduate work it was not until the 19205 after he had left toronto 
 that a fully active graduate program was established during his tenure only three students completed phd programs one of whom 
 was collip through these years collip s studies were not the sole source of his inspiration during his final undergraduate 
 year he began to notice a certain contralto in the trinity chapel choir when it became clear that collip was 
 too shy to act on his own behalf a classmate intervened and arranged a first meeting with ray vivian ralph 
 ray ralph was the daughter of a druggist from dundas ontario and an arts student at trinity s sister college 
 st hilda s vibrant and fun loving known to her family as a tomboy ray was said to be the 
 one to climb through windows 0:win 0:dows to visit bert 9 collip continued as a resident at trinity while doing 
 his graduate work he was offered a teaching fellowship under macallum and this 
 the research ideal 1892 19x0 9 he accepted promptly entering into the work with great enthusiasm he absorbed all that 
 macallum had to teach him an indefatigable worker macallum taught his classes during the day and worked on his research 
 late into the night collip later recalled i was completely over awed by the austere and heavily bearded professor whom 
 i held in great esteem and almost reverence 10 macallum s training style consisted 0:con 0:sisted of setting problems for 
 investigation and then letting the students work them out for themselves collip later grew to appreciate this approach 0:ap 0:proach 
 when he ran his own laboratory in much the same way he quickly learned that macallum customarily looked in at 
 the laboratory between eleven and twelve at night and as an eager young student collip made sure to be present 
 at that time so as to make a good impression 0:im 0:pression before long he also came to recognize that 
 the quiet hours of the late evenings and weekends were the most productive for laboratory 0:labora 0:tory work out of 
 this realization sprang his lifelong habit of working all hours of the night collip s research projects were heavily influenced 
 by macallum s interests 0:inter 0:ests in microchemistry and the chemical composition of bodily fluids macallum first assigned him to 
 study the microchemistry of the nerve cells of the central ganglionic chain of the medicinal leech in order to conduct 
 this work collip had to make fresh preparations of leech to examine 0:ex 0:amine under the ultramicroscope he acquired some 
 considerable skill in handling the instrument for studies and for taking photomicrographs as a beginner in the lab collip experienced 
 a couple of mishaps first his supply of leeches escaped when he tied the muslin top on their container too 
 loosely because he viewed his professor with such awe collip hid his mistake and bought a fresh lot of leeches 
 with money from his own pocket later more seriously he broke the quartz cover slip of the special chamber that 
 was designed for use with the cardioid condenser of the zeiss ultramicroscope again he replaced this at his own expense 
 even though the cover slip had to be ordered from the german manufacturer fortunately collip s fear of macallum faded 
 over time and he began to feel more certain that there was a kind sympathetic 0:sym 0:pathetic soul behind the 
 severe face collip learned to operate the freezing microtome to prepare sections of the fresh nerve cell material and then 
 to use the microchemical staining techniques that macallum had developed to locate chemical components frozen sections of the freshly dissected 
 ganglia were dropped on the surface of a chilled solution of silver nitrate then the section was transferred to a 
 microscopic slide mounted in glycerin and exposed to sunlight this delicate work required that the tissue be frozen instantaneously and 
 put on the surface of the reagent while still frozen usually this meant that the investigator had to wait for 
 the 
 j b collip 10 arrival of winter and when the mercury dropped sufficiently prop open a lab window and perform 
 the procedure standing in front of it collip conceived an innovative way around this slow and uncertain process constructing an 
 asbestos lined box with a plate glass cover and two arm holes with padded sleeves he used a carbon dioxide 
 jet to chill the air inside the box and then manipulated the microtome through the sleeves using his apparatus collip 
 was able to find that an intense black staining occurred in the central core of the ganglia and the clusters 
 of nerve cells when the solution reacted with sunlight on his visits to the lab macallum inspected the young man 
 s progress and generally murmured very interesting or keep at it the first time he saw the black staining of 
 the ganglia however he became 0:be 0:came tremendously excited and gathered several other professors to see the material the silver 
 nitrate reaction he thought might indicate the presence of adrenalin in the cells collip was delighted by macallum s interest 
 and thrilled at the possible significance of the work macallum s 0:macal 0:lum 0:s enthusiasm was positively infectious the possibility 
 that invertebrate nerve cells might contain adrenalin was exciting but the evidence that collip was able to summon was only 
 suggestive the standard test for the presence of adrenalin involved 0:in 0:volved evaluating the effect of a test sample on 
 the blood pressure of dogs when these tests were done the results were negative it was only later that other 
 investigators using more sensitive methods would succeed 0:suc 0:ceed in demonstrating the presence of adrenalin collip wrote up his work 
 as a thesis entitled some observations on the structure and microchemistry of nerve cells this earned him a master of 
 arts degree 0:de 0:gree in 191 3 he also had the honour of having his research incorporated 0:incorpo 0:rated into 
 a joint paper that macallum presented at the meeting of the international medical association and the british association for the 
 advancement of science in birmingham 11 collip launched into his doctoral work with a new problem assigned to him by 
 macallum he was to make a comparative study of the secretion 0:secre 0:tion of hydrochloric acid by the gastric tubules 
 of the vertebrate stomach 0:stom 0:ach in this work as with the previous collip was highly influenced by his professor 
 s advocacy of biochemical methods to examine the functional 0:func 0:tional rather than the morphological aspects of tissues collip used 
 microchemical methods to localize chemical compounds in the gastric tissue of various species of mammals birds reptiles and amphibians and 
 used this data to theorize about the mechanism that caused the formation 0:for 0:mation of hydrochloric acid in the stomach 
 he earned his phd in biochemistry 0:bio 0:chemistry in 19 16 for this work and his thesis was published as 
 a monograph in 1920 12 
 the research ideal i 892 1920 11 t college life outside the laboratory collip thrashed out his ideas about the 
 broader meaning of science with his fellow students at trinity he wrote an article 0:arti 0:cle for the trinity university 
 review the literary journal of the college entitled mind and the cerebral mechanism he explained the significance 0:sig 0:nificance of 
 recent scientific findings on the activities of the brain and argued that physiologists embryologists and histologists were throwing 0:throw 0:ing 
 much light on the question of cognition like macallum he did not accept vitalist explanations of nature yet he also 
 rejected the extreme materialist view that the individual was just a puppet merely a bundle of reflexes reacting to external 
 stimuli or that consciousness is an epiphenomenon rather he argued that the physiologist was only able to study the behaviour 
 of the animal machine and that an explanation 0:explana 0:tion of the will or ego behind the behaviour remained outside 
 the bounds of science 13 collip s interests were highly influenced by the evolutionary orientation 0:orienta 0:tion of his teacher 
 one paper he read to the science club entitled evolution dealt with the weismann germ plasm theory another paper 0:pa 
 0:per was a review of macallum s theory that the proportions of elements in blood plasma resembled those in the 
 sea water from which the first life forms emerged collip s friend and roommate divinity student harding priest presented a 
 paper to the theological society on evolution 0:evo 0:lution and christianity priest attempted to reconcile evolutionary theory with christian thought 
 and used the argument from design to suggest that the case for theism was strengthened by the scientific evidence 0:evi 
 0:dence for evolution in the discussion collip suggested that the idea of law as developed from evolution should be of 
 supreme value for the theologian as it was for the scientist 14 during these years he continued to court ray 
 ralph a pair of photos 0:pho 0:tos from this period show bert and ray together with ray s sister maude 
 and her fiance reg turnbull a divinity student at knox college 0:col 0:lege in the first snapshot the two couples 
 swing happily in a hammock 0:ham 0:mock posing for the photographer in their summer whites in the second the four 
 are collapsed in a merry heap on the ground the hammock 0:ham 0:mock crumpled beneath them bert and ray were 
 to marry later that year just after christmas and maude and reg would be married three weeks after that 15 
 these happy antics were the last of an era about to pass many a typical 0:typ 0:ical trinity student was 
 away at the family cottage in august of 19 14 when a fateful newspaper arrived announcing the outbreak of war 
 by the time students returned to class in the autumn many trinity men 
 j b collip 12 had already enlisted the lectures continued but outside the windows the footfall of officers in training 
 drummed in the distance soon the stone corridors emptied of their usual crush of inhabitants only a few men and 
 the st hilda s women remained to fill the class rolls collip pressed on with his research around this time 
 he was introduced 0:intro 0:duced to herber h moshier the first professor of physiology at the university of alberta moshier 
 was a young medical practitioner who had been the second appointment to the faculty of medicine at alberta 0:al 0:berta 
 an active vibrant man he not only taught physiology pathology 0:pathol 0:ogy and clinical medicine but also organized the student 
 medical service where he provided treatment to students 16 moshier invited collip to join him in edmonton as a lecturer 
 in biochemistry in september 0:sep 0:tember 191 5 collip took up the appointment having almost finished his doctorate imbibing the 
 western spirit the university of alberta collip s first job was at a very young institution the province of alberta 
 had only been created in 1908 and the provincial university three years later edmonton was as at least one faculty 
 member thought a remote backwater of the british empire university president henry marshall tory took on the challenge of building 
 an institution of higher learning from scratch he championed the building of professional faculties so that albertans could be trained 
 without having to travel to universities in central canada the faculty of medicine was founded shortly after in 191 3 
 against some opposition from members of the local medical profession 0:pro 0:fession who believed such a venture overly ambitious and 
 likely to result in a second rate institution their children were usually sent east to their own alma maters mcgill 
 or toronto since the university of alberta medical school was the only one in canada west of winnipeg manitoba it 
 had an important position in providing medical teaching and service throughout the west tory strongly agreed with the view of 
 abraham flexner in his report on medical education of 19 10 particularly flexner s 0:flex 0:ner 0:s insistence that medical 
 training be founded on the basic sciences and that scholarly research should be promoted in its early years the school 
 had only a three year medical program which meant that the students 0:stu 0:dents had to complete their basic science 
 studies in alberta then go east to the medical schools in central canada to complete their clinical years of training 
 17 edmonton was located on a high flat plain through which the north saskatchewan river had carved a sharp groove 
 with two hundred foot banks the town had once served as the gateway to klondike gold the 
 the research ideal 1 892 1920 13 large majority of albertans lived in rural settings many of them new immigrants 
 from eastern europe and newcomers mixed with native people metis and earlier anglo saxon pioneers the university was built on 
 the south side of the river just outside edmonton about a mile west of the town of strathcona a settlement 
 clustered around the end of the canadian pacific railway s spur line from calgary in the early years students had 
 to march to the outskirts of town and scramble across a railroad bridge to reach the university campus the first 
 structures 0:struc 0:tures were built atop marshy land crisscrossed by indian trails and thick with willow poplar and scraggly brush 
 the earliest buildings were broad plain edifices made of the local yellow sandstone which spoke of practicality and substantiality across 
 the north saskatchewan river on a rise by the bank the ornate provincial legislature 0:legis 0:lature building was taking shape 
 one of tory s arguments for the establishment of a medical faculty had been based on the need for doctors 
 in rural areas when practitioners 0:practitio 0:ners arrived from the east they tended to set up practice in the urban 
 areas leaving the majority of alberta s population without adequate medical care tory suggested that only locally raised physicians would 
 appreciate the needs of the sparsely distributed population and would return to their small communities to practise in some ways 
 collip s students would practise as their predecessors had the century before treating their patients in their homes and travelling 
 great distances over unpaved roads in the summer motor cars might serve but when winter 0:win 0:ter snows and spring 
 thaws made these roads thick with mud and deadly ruts practitioners had to resort to the old standbys of travel 
 by horseback and sleigh through sparsely settled brush 18 when collip arrived in edmonton he was only twenty two years 
 old still boyish looking and terribly shy in front of his medical students 0:stu 0:dents he returned briefly to ontario 
 that first december to marry his sweetheart ray who had just completed her bachelor of arts that spring some of 
 his students learned of his wedding and wrote congratulations 0:con 0:gratulations dr collip on the blackboard when he arrived back 
 in edmonton 0:ed 0:monton collip blushed madly and rubbed the note off the board one former student recalled that despite 
 his shyness collip was an excellent teacher full of enthusiasm for his subject and able to talk lucidly for an 
 hour without the use of notes his early attempts at teaching did not always 0:al 0:ways go smoothly though in 
 january of his first year a number of third year medical students made an official complaint to herber moshier 0:mosh 
 0:ier it seems collip may not have been quite as reliable as his students wished they listed their young professor 
 s faults he did not always start lectures on time he gave no notice to the class when he was 
 unavailable 0:un 0:available to lecture and he did not give work with sufficient regularity 
 j b collip 14 therefore they claimed they were not entirely to be blamed for the low average standing on 
 their christmas test these students were in their final 0:fi 0:nal year at alberta before heading off to the more 
 established medical schools to complete the final years of training some were afraid that they might disgrace themselves in front 
 of the men in eastern colleges 0:col 0:leges in his own defence collip suggested that he had had to surmount 
 0:sur 0:mount many difficulties in this first year that the class had failed to appreciate he argued that those who 
 complained had a poor attitude to their work by way of illustration he noted that he had set aside the 
 last portion of a course for individual experimentation but had found that only half the class attended regularly and that 
 the other half came in at the end of the period just to inspect the results of the other students 
 0:stu 0:dents his medical students with much more pressing and practical matters in mind seem not to have taken up 
 the ideal of research to the extent he had hoped l 9 typical sophomoric fun and even the excitement of 
 encountering new ideas now had to compete with the war in europe for the students energy at university many students 
 and faculty enlisted for service collip s department head the ever vigorous herber moshier was given a leave of absence 
 to volunteer for war service in 191 6 after his departure 0:depar 0:ture collip was left carrying all the teaching 
 duties in physiology biochemistry 0:bio 0:chemistry and pharmacology the physical facilities at alberta were primitive compared to those at toronto 
 because there was no medical building all the teaching was conducted in the power house during this time collip s 
 only assistants were practising physicians who served as part time demonstrators in the laboratories this left collip little time for 
 the research he loved so much his only publication from this period was a review of work on internal secretions 
 that he presented to the alberta medical association in 19 16 consisting of a short resume of what was known 
 about the function of the endocrine glands the paper 0:pa 0:per briefly discussed their value for practical medicine it is 
 one of the few indications that collip had an interest in hormones and their relation 0:rela 0:tion to human health 
 10 summer travels one of the problems faced by the faculty members at alberta was isolation 0:isola 0:tion from the 
 larger medical and scientific communities travel to the cities of central canada was expensive and time consuming few guests came 
 west to the frontier the university library subscribed to several 0:sev 0:eral medical journals but these were circulated in a 
 slow and cumbersome 0:cumber 0:some fashion as a result the instructors and students had to develop their own ways to 
 keep abreast of the current literature collip was 
 the research ideal 1892 1910 15 among the founding members of a medical journal reporting club that met to share 
 a meal and present abstracts of recent scientific articles 11 collip also took advantage of opportunities to travel during his 
 summers 0:sum 0:mers these breaks from his routine afforded him interesting and varied 0:var 0:ied experiences and a reprieve from 
 his heavy teaching duties he was readily inspired and influenced by the ideas and methods of those he encountered and 
 he could become quite enthusiastic about something new he had picked up in his early years at alberta his research 
 work continued along the same lines it had taken during his graduate studies but it was also influenced by people 
 he met and the materials available to him during his summers collip travelled to the research station of the biological 
 board of canada at departure bay nanaimo on vancouver 0:van 0:couver island after his first trying year at alberta he 
 spent from late june to early august at nanaimo collecting specimens of salmon and investigating their pigmentation the following summer 
 collip visited the university of chicago partly to use the extensive library facilities during another summer at nanaimo he assisted 
 newton harvey in his study of the problem of luminescence collecting a marine aluminescent worm that came to the surface 
 on a certain day in midsummer each year in order to spawn 12 the war was however a dark fearsome 
 backdrop to these events the university of alberta had a student body of only 440 when the war started but 
 by its bloody end some 484 students staff and faculty 0:fac 0:ulty had gone into active service and 82 had 
 been killed in action khaki became common around campus after a canadian officers training corps was established there many students 
 particularly medical students were trained through the military medical corps herber moshier showing the same energy he had in peacetime 
 organized 0:orga 0:nized the nth field ambulance unit to be staffed by students from the four western provincial universities students 
 who served in this corps could receive university credit for their service at the front moshier a captain and later 
 lieutenant colonel took his unit to the somme just months before the end of the war he was hit by 
 shrapnel while driving an ambulance and killed instantly l 3 the war hit close to the family as well only 
 four months after reg turnbull had married ray s sister maude the young divinity student joined up along with his 
 whole class volunteering to go as a regular soldier rather than as a chaplain the following year he was killed 
 lost along with the more than ten thousand canadian casualties at vimy ridge maude widowed so young never married again 
 in 19 1 8 bert and ray had their first child a daughter they named margaret mary photos show the 
 youthful new father proudly hovering over his baby s pram his eyes aglow the new aunts ray s sister 
 j b collip 16 maude and bert s sister rita each made trips out west to visit the latest member 
 of the family rita was now a student at trinity too she trained to become a teacher like her mother 
 and after graduation taught greek and latin to many generations of high school students in port credit 2 at the 
 close of the war returning soldiers began to fill the classrooms and strain the medical school s resources in 19zo 
 the provincial government 0:gov 0:ernment approved the plans for the construction of a new medical building to house the faculty 
 that same year the rockefeller foundation 0:founda 0:tion awarded 5 million to assist the development of medical education in canada 
 the older schools toronto mcgill and dalhousie received 0:re 0:ceived 1 million each alberta as yet unproven was granted the 
 interest 0:inter 0:est from an endowment of 500 000 this supported tory s ambitions to stimulate medical research and scientific 
 and clinical teaching with demobilization arthur long came into collip s life long had operated a bookstore in norfolk england 
 before emigrating to canada 0:can 0:ada he had farmed for a few years and was a carpenter s helper during 
 the construction of the university after the university was built he had been hired as a general laboratory assistant by 
 moshier he served during 0:dur 0:ing the war as an orderly room sergeant and after 19 19 returned to his 
 post in the physiology department long was to became collip s loyal factotum for many decades keeping the laboratory in 
 order and the morale of its inhabitants high ls the end of the war also brought expanded opportunities for travel 
 collip spent the summer of 19 19 in britain visiting professor noel paton at glasgow and working in the laboratory 
 of professor j b leathes at sheffield leathes was then conducting a study of the effect of sleep and awakening 
 on carbon dioxide tension of air in the alveoli of the lungs and the rate of excretion of acid and 
 basic phosphates by the kidney collip served as a guinea pig in this study sleeping at leathes s home so 
 that he could be awakened at given intervals and have specimens of his alveolar air taken immediately collip found his 
 experiences in britain extremely stimulating and he began a flurry of investigations of his own that led to the publication 
 of seventeen papers the following year he was so impressed by the type of experimental procedure that leathes employed that 
 when he returned 0:re 0:turned to edmonton he proceeded to use his own students as experimental 0:experi 0:mental subjects in 
 a similar study he examined the effect of prolonged hyperpnoea abnormally deep or rapid breathing on the rate of excretion 
 0:excre 0:tion of phosphates and ammonia and on the concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood some of the students 
 entered into the spirit of things so vigorously that they went into muscle spasms of tetany in his experiment collip 
 used the recently published van slyke apparatus for 
 the research ideal 1 892 1920 17 determining the carbon dioxide content of bodily fluids with his student 0:stu 0:dent 
 percy backus he extended his study to the alkali reserve of blood plasma and to other bodily fluids in dogs 
 i 6 during the same period collip also prepared four articles on the problem 0:prob 0:lem of osmotic pressure between 
 blood cells and their fluid medium this line of research bore the imprint of macallum s influence the study was 
 concerned with surface tension phenomena and the transport of solutes across membranes and it employed microchemical techniques later that year 
 collip undertook a number of studies of the action of adrenalin this may have been stimulated by his interest in 
 trying to locate adrenalin 0:adrena 0:lin in nerve cells while doing his master s thesis research in this work he 
 prepared extracts of many mammalian tissues heart lung spleen liver brain cord pancreas skeletal muscle testes small intestine pituitary thymus 
 thyroid and parathyroid and tested their ability to make uterine 0:uter 0:ine and intestinal muscle contract 7 the next summer 
 he again visited the marine biological station at departure bay nanaimo there he extended his study of the carbon dioxide 
 concentration in bodily fluids to the marine forms he took from the vicinity of the station his shooting fishing and 
 clam digging trips provided him with a great variety of research subjects medusae sea anemones starfish sea urchins barnacles clams 
 lampreys fish and snakes he made a special study of anaerobic respiration in the edible clam i 8 this period 
 of active research was marred by an unhappy development 0:develop 0:ment in the department since his arrival collip had been 
 steadily promoted first to assistant professor in 19 17 and then to associate professor in 19 19 having held down 
 the department on his own throughout the war collip felt himself the obvious candidate to take over the headship of 
 the department when in 1920 tory decided to hire ardrey w downs from mcgill to replace moshier collip viewed this 
 as a grave personal insult a colleague ventured the suggestion that perhaps tory considered collip too young and inexperienced to 
 take on this position though in fact collip was the same age twentyseven 0:twenty 0:seven that moshier had been when 
 he died this was not the first clash of this sort at the medical faculty the year before tory had 
 incurred 0:in 0:curred the ire of daniel revell the first member of the faculty and the professor of anatomy when 
 he appointed allan rankin to the deanship 0:dean 0:ship rankin had only been professor of bacteriology at alberta for a 
 few months before he went overseas for war service revell like collip and most of the others of the small 
 group that held the school together during the war was a toronto graduate rankin and most of the postwar 0:post 
 0:war appointments were mcgill graduates as was tory revell suspected 0:sus 0:pected that old school loyalties might have influenced tory 
 s decision 
 18 j b collip collip was particularly aggrieved by downs s appointment because he felt that it reflected upon his 
 own teaching and research abilities to make things worse he thought of downs as ten years behind the times in 
 his research the incident was to cause friction between tory and collip for some time collip s bitterness was so 
 intense that on downs s first day at alberta collip exchanged angry words with him 9 in october 1920 tory 
 requested a rockefeller foundation travelling fellowship for collip perhaps this was to make up for collip s hurt feelings in 
 the hiring of downs 30 or to serve as a reward for bearing the responsibility for the whole department during 
 the war certainly it was to give him exposure to new ideas and techniques one month later collip learned that 
 he had won the fellowship what he could not know was that this fellowship would transform his life 
 l 2 the discovery of insulin 1921 1922 usually the first really significant discovery gives direction to the whole subsequent 
 life of its discoverer hans selye from dream to discovery 1 the rockefeller travelling fellowship gave collip a chance to 
 set aside his teaching duties for fifteen months during this time he would visit and study with distinguished scientists and 
 devote himself to the research 0:re 0:search he loved so much when the award was announced in november 0:novem 0:ber 
 1920 collip began to make his plans he considered travelling to work with men such as sir henry dale and 
 william bayliss in london benjamin moore in oxford donald van slyke at the rockefeller institute 0:insti 0:tute in new york 
 yandell henderson of yale and j j r macleod in toronto he hoped to spend this time learning more about 
 the chemistry 0:chemis 0:try of respiration and the chemistry and physiology of the glands of internal 0:in 0:ternal secretion after 
 some reflection he settled on spending his first six months with macleod in toronto then six months with van slyke 
 in new york and finally four months with dale in hampstead 2 collip was at an early stage of his 
 career but he was already demonstrating 0:demon 0:strating a great deal of ambition and tenacity in his negotiations with his 
 administrative heads he was one of a new generation of scientists trained in original investigation and fully expecting to make 
 research a significant part of his academic career university of alberta president h m tory was in some ways very 
 sympathetic to collip s goals but found it was not always easy to provide conditions suitable for research 0:re 0:search 
 tory was a true institution builder and a scientist himself although 0:al 0:though he had long been away from the 
 physics laboratory he was a strong proponent of developing the laboratory sciences particularly if they could be linked to utilitarian 
 purposes 3 in the faculty of medicine 0:medi 0:cine the teaching of medical students remained the staple function 
 j b collip 20 despite the rockefeller benefaction to the faculty funds for extra staff equipment and conference travel were 
 scarce collip put up a long struggle over many years to eke out more time and resources for his research 
 work by the autumn of 192 0 ray was expecting their second child and bert grew more concerned about providing 
 for their growing family after some bargaining with tory he negotiated a sabbatical leave from alberta with very generous terms 
 in addition to his rockefeller fellowship 0:fellow 0:ship he would receive a 1 000 bonus to augment the stipend to 
 the level of his full salary in addition he secured tory s promise that he would be promoted to full 
 professor on his return and made chair of a new department of biochemistry that was to be split off from 
 physiology 0:physi 0:ology tory s final words to collip before he left on his rockefeller fellowship were to chastise him 
 for his propensity to negotiate for financial 0:fi 0:nancial considerations tory warned him not to say or do anything that 
 can possibly be construed as self seeking in his dealings with the rockefeller officials since collip would be risking aid 
 to other people besides himself collip assured him that he would exercise discretion 4 in april 19z1 collip returned to 
 toronto to study with j j r macleod 0:mac 0:leod professor of physiology and a renowned authority on carbohydrate 0:carbohy 
 0:drate metabolism his wife and two young daughters travelled with him margaret their first child and their baby barbara born 
 that winter once installed at toronto collip settled into the study of the effect of ph on the concentration of 
 sugar in the blood 5 his old mentor a b macallum was no longer at toronto he had become the 
 first full time chairman of the honorary advisory council for scientific 0:scien 0:tific and industrial research a body created in 
 19 16 in support of the war effort this group soon became the national research council of canada while the 
 ostensible reason for collip s sabbatical leave was to broaden his research experiences he also used the time to cultivate 
 new contacts and career opportunities in may he wrote back to alberta to his dean allan c rankin informing him 
 that he had received three excellent job offers since leaving edmonton only a month into his fellowship it appears collip 
 was already considering staying on in toronto rather than returning to alberta he told rankin that he had received an 
 offer of a real post as associate research professor of physiology under macleod the plan had only fallen through at 
 the last minute because of a cut in the research spending of the provincial government 0:gov 0:ernment macleod had advised 
 him to instead take the position of assistant 0:as 0:sistant professor of pathological chemistry under victor j harding collip and 
 his toronto colleagues had agreed that he should certainly remain for the next teaching year the question of whether or 
 not he 
 the discovery of insulin 1921 192z 21 would stay longer was left open this change in plans required collip to 
 alter the terms of his fellowship he decided to spend the summer of 1921 at the marine biological laboratory at 
 wood s hole on cape cod and at the rockefeller institute for medical research in new york city he would 
 then take the entire school term at toronto and spend the final summer of his leave with dale in britain 
 collip used the offer by toronto as leverage with alberta he assured 0:as 0:sured rankin that he had not given 
 up his intention of returning to alberta 0:al 0:berta but he intimated it is true i have been advised by 
 different men not to go back under any consideration as a much bigger future is presenting 0:pre 0:senting itself in 
 the east however i know alberta a little better and also its possible future also my heart is in the 
 school there he warned obviously however if the university wishes me to return it will have to be on a 
 slightly different basis than the one suggested before 0:be 0:fore i left he described the very satisfactory situation he was 
 promised 0:prom 0:ised at toronto he would have eight hours of work per week the help of two demonstrators and 
 all sorts of facilities for research including dogs a fully equipped operating room chemicals and glassware 6 since tory was 
 travelling in the east collip asked to meet with him in macleod s office to discuss the toronto offer banting 
 s idea another visitor to macleod s lab that may was a young surgeon frederick 0:fred 0:erick grant banting banting 
 almost exactly a year older than collip had served as a medical officer in france and britain during the last 
 years of the war and then upon his return had set up a practice in london ontario since business had 
 been slow in his new practice he had taken a part time job as a demonstrator at the university of 
 western 0:west 0:ern ontario banting had been preparing notes for a talk on carbohydrate 0:carbohy 0:drate metabolism when he came 
 across research on diabetes mellitus the author of this research study american pathologist moses barron suggested that the cause of 
 diabetes as many other researchers were beginning to believe could be traced to the cells of the pancreas known as 
 the islets of langerhans the pancreas has two types of cells acinar 0:aci 0:nar cells and islet cells acinar cells 
 secrete digestive enzymes into the intestines and are thus considered an external secretion of the pancreas since the gastrointestinal tract 
 is considered oddly on the face of it external to the body scattered amidst the acinar cells like tiny islands 
 are the so called islet cells whose function was still unclear at the time of barron s study could it 
 be that these cells produce an internal secretion 0:secre 0:tion that is a substance that is released into the bloodstream 
 and could the activity of this internal secretion have something to do with 
 j b collip 22 whether or not someone became diabetic a number of researchers began to think so since the 
 late nineteenth century physiologists had been exploring the internal secretions of the glands secretions such as thyroxin from the thyroid 
 and adrenalin from the adrenal glands these internal secretions or hormones as physiologist ernest starling 0:star 0:ling named them in 
 1902 were defined as chemical messengers capable of setting off physiological responses in organs far from the location in which 
 they were produced in the case study that barron described a stone had blocked the pancreatic duct so that the 
 acinar cells had atrophied interestingly the islet cells had remained intact banting reasoned that if the islets of langerhans were 
 somehow related to diabetes he should find a way to separate their activity from the digestive function of the surrounding 
 0:surround 0:ing acini tissue perhaps if one were to tie off the pancreatic duct one could make the acinar cells 
 die off as happened with barren s subject in his diary entry of 31 october i zo banting wrote diabetus 
 sic ligate pancreatic ducts of dog keep dogs alive till acini degenerate leaving islets try to isolate the internal secretion 
 of these to relieve glycosurea 7 over the next weeks banting was so excited by this idea that he began 
 0:be 0:gan to pursue it with various colleagues 8 since the facilities for a research 0:re 0:search project of this 
 sort didn t exist at western banting was directed to j j r macleod the respected expert on carbohydrate metabolism 
 at toronto toronto was one place banting might find the resources he would need for such extensive animal experiments macleod 
 was initially 0:ini 0:tially sceptical about banting s abilities finding that the young doctor had only a superficial understanding of 
 the literature on diabetes and little familiarity with the methods of physiological research after all this problem was already being 
 studied by a number of skilled researchers 0:re 0:searchers in several countries many had attempted to isolate the internal 0:inter 
 0:nal secretion of the pancreas before and had failed in their efforts at length macleod agreed to provide banting with 
 the facilities to test his ideas the following summer macleod reckoned that even if banting could only come up with 
 negative results these would still be valuable as a contribution to physiological knowledge 9 banting arrived at macleod s lab 
 at about the same time that collip came to toronto macleod and banting seem to have met several times to 
 determine the best course of action banting could take macleod likely suggested that banting should first familiarize himself with diabetes 
 by removing the pancreas of one or two dogs he probably advised banting to try to make acinar cells atrophy 
 by ligating the pancreatic ducts of other dogs once banting had done these things he could begin to use the 
 internal secretion from these partially atrophied pancreases to treat 
 the discovery of insulin 1921 192 2 23 i 1 the dogs he had surgically made diabetic to test the 
 results banting would need to use chemical tests of the blood and urine unfortunately he had little knowledge of these 
 sorts of techniques and would probably require some advice and assistance around this time banting and collip first met in 
 macleod s office banting copied collip s summer address into his notebook perhaps thinking the biochemist might be someone he 
 could contact should he have any questions about these chemical concepts 0:con 0:cepts and procedures 10 since collip found he 
 was getting some good work done he remained in toronto until 1 6 june when macleod sailed off on his 
 vacation collip 0:col 0:lip also began his summer travels first to montreal then to new york new haven and boston 
 ray not deterred by having young children was his constant companion on these trips according to collip s associate 0:associ 
 0:ate robert noble collip had early on perfected an autoclaved baby formula 0:for 0:mula that allowed he and ray to 
 tote baby supplies for over a week 11 happily the seaside locations of some of the research stations made them 
 particularly good holiday spots for the family collip spent part of the summer at the marine biological laboratory at wood 
 s hole where he continued his studies on anaerobic respiration 0:respira 0:tion in mollusca he was delighted to be able 
 to gather much data for this study the atmosphere at the laboratory was highly stimulating and he was able to 
 discuss his work with such leading biologists as jacques loeb a p mathews and ralph lillie one of the things 
 he picked up was a new method of blood sugar determination this he learned from the investigators at the next 
 bench a professor bradley of wisconsin and his student elmer severinghaus who were studying dogfish the shaffer hartman technique of 
 blood sugar determination had just been published and collip found it so superior to any he had used before that 
 he subsequently refused to use any other method after 0:af 0:ter wood s hole he travelled on to the st 
 andrew s marine biological station in new brunswick to continue his study of anaerobic respiration 0:respira 0:tion in the local 
 marine forms by the end of the summer he counted himself to have had a very profitable time he was 
 pleased to be asked to write an article for endocrinology the official organ for the society for the study of 
 the internal secretions he had published some of his physiological studies of adrenalin and one solid review of internal secretions 
 in the canadian medical association journal a few years before since he felt endocrinology was a clinical journal it wasn 
 t entirely 0:en 0:tirely though perhaps it was more so than the physiological and biochemical 0:bio 0:chemical journals in which 
 he generally published he considered the invitation a tangible recognition of his published work 11 although his research work flourished 
 over the summer his private negotiations with alberta stalled collip had arranged a meeting with 
 j b collip 24 tory in toronto but the occasion had been strained a flurry of letters between the two 
 men followed full of ugly recriminations tory was angry that collip had changed his travel plans without consulting him collip 
 tried to argue that he had only made these changes to get the most out of his leave he maintained 
 that his spending the winter in toronto did not mean he was making any commitment to that university 0:univer 0:sity 
 collip offered while as i see it i have an assured future in the east if i care to stay 
 yet i have never changed my opinion of the west tory had asked that collip keep an eye out for 
 a good candidate to fill a post in the new biochemistry department collip was able to report 0:re 0:port that 
 he had found not one but two very good choices and he suggested that he needed them both each of 
 them had a very different type of training he argued and he felt that with these two he could build 
 up a real research department one that could undertake questions 0:ques 0:tions not only of academic but also economic importance 
 here collip was appealing directly to what historian marianne ainley calls tory s entrepreneurial ideology of science 13 collip maintained 
 that money alone would not take him back to edmonton rather he needed the promise of full time staff that 
 would allow him to carry out research he also wrangled with tory over the promised bonus of 1 000 by 
 choosing to take the post at toronto for the year collip had sacrificed his stipend from the rockefeller foundation for 
 twelve months he argued 0:ar 0:gued that he should keep his bonus since his decision to stay in the east 
 was not of his own seeking but the opportunity offered i embraced 0:em 0:braced it because by so doing i 
 was to spend the year to the best advantage 0:advan 0:tage collip reminded tory that he had been cut to 
 the quick when he did not receive the headship of the physiology and biochemistry department after a year of reflection 
 he claimed that he could now better understand tory s decision recognizing that it had only been based on the 
 information available to tory at that time collip submitted 0:submit 0:ted that the recognition he was now receiving in the 
 east was beginning to heal that wound l 4 unfortunately for collip this letter only served to enrage tory further 
 0:fur 0:ther tory chastised collip for remaining at toronto and dropping back into the old groove as he saw it 
 after tory had gone to such effort 0:ef 0:fort to win him the opportunity for broader experience furthermore tory bristled 
 at collip s continued attempts to bargain for a better position 0:po 0:sition tory s appointment of ardrey downs the 
 year before and collip s 0:col 0:lip 0:s harsh and unconcealed opinion of downs s abilities continued to be a 
 sore point between tory and collip tory was shocked by the hostile comments collip made about downs during their meeting 
 although 0:al 0:though he was certain these remarks had to be based on a very wrong impression of downs tory 
 was sufficiently upset about them that he 
 the discovery of insulin 1971 19x2 2 5 1 1 had turned to his mcgill cronies men whose judgment he 
 trusted to be assured that there was no foundation for what collip had said he admonished collip that you could 
 repeat about a colleague what you did to me on mere rumour is somewhat startling tory explained that although collip 
 had promptly complained to tory about what downs had said to him upon his arrival downs had remained silent about 
 collip s conduct until he was asked directly by tory reproaching 0:reproach 0:ing collip tory wrote the only reason that 
 i refer to these matters now is that it brings into my mind a doubt whether in spite of the 
 many good qualities of mind you possess you can ever overcome that disposition 0:dispo 0:sition of seeing matters only in 
 the light of your own desires a disposition 0:disposi 0:tion which is recognized by all your old friends tory made 
 it clear that he did not feel that the university owed collip anything more than it had already given him 
 he noted that collip was the only member of staff to receive an eighteen month leave on full salary 0:sal 
 0:ary none of these points seem to have had any effect upon you when you made arrangements cancelling all that 
 i had done since collip was receiving a larger salary at toronto than the one he had from alberta tory 
 thought the board of governors might consider giving collip a portion 0:por 0:tion of the originally proposed 1 000 bonus 
 but only for the three or four summer months after he had completed his year at toronto and before 0:be 
 0:fore he resumed his position at alberta as for collip s hopes of establishing 0:estab 0:lishing a research department tory 
 strongly reined in his ambitions making no definite promises if i have one ambition greater than another 0:an 0:other it 
 is that in the next ten years we will build up all the scientific departments 0:de 0:partments into research departments 
 and as far as my strength of mind and body will enable me to get the men and money i 
 will do it he indicated 0:indi 0:cated that he fully wished to provide opportunities for any staff members capable of 
 research but had no intention of singling out collip s department 0:depart 0:ment for special treatment he concluded if you 
 come back to us i want you to come back not in a spirit of bickering but with an ambition 
 to co operate with your other colleagues in promoting not only your own department but the well being of the 
 whole university ls collip hurt and chastened by tory s harsh remarks began to regret his whole conduct since moshier 
 s death he wrote back to tory that my loyalty to the university of alberta for example should for one 
 moment be called into question and all my work and activities be attributed to selfish motives makes me feel pretty 
 sick he explained in his own defence i have often mentioned financial matters to you but i would hate to 
 think that you feel i am a money grabber i long ago set myself to keep up to date in 
 my work and that can only be accomplished 0:ac 0:complished by travel combined with work i have never spent a 
 summer 0:sum 0:mer in my own laboratory yet and my bank account tells the tale 
 j b collip 26 however i do feel that i have not lost anything but indeed have gained a great 
 deal by thus getting about 16 tory replied in december with a final offer collip was to receive a salary 
 higher than the one he had in toronto and with a bonus of 100 per month for the following summer 
 that is for the final months of his leave after he had departed toronto tory also agreed to put one 
 full time staff member in the department but left the question of additional 0:addi 0:tional assistance for further discussion collip 
 would be responsible for four hours of lectures and six hours of laboratory teaching a week which tory argued was 
 perfectly reasonable 17 when collip returned to the pathology department at toronto in the autumn of 19x1 he looked in 
 on the work of banting and banting s young associate charles best a recent graduate of the same honours physiology 
 and biochemistry program from which collip had graduated 0:gradu 0:ated banting and best had had a very exciting summer while 
 macleod and collip had been away they had been able to produce interesting results by injecting an alcoholic extract of 
 the pancreas into depancreatized 0:depancre 0:atized dogs this extract had the remarkable effect of lowering the blood sugar in diabetic 
 dogs banting was very pleased with his results and believed that they might be applied to the treatment of diabetes 
 in humans collip found this work promising and on several occasions indicated that he would like to help banting thought 
 this a good idea and asked macleod if collip might join the research team during the first months of banting 
 s project macleod had been reluctant to add more hands but now he began to reconsider particularly because banting and 
 best had made another important discovery they found that to make the special extract they did not have to use 
 the labour intensive method they had devised earlier that is they did not have to painstakingly tie off the pancreatic 
 ducts of dogs wait for the acinar cells the cells making 0:mak 0:ing the digestive secretion to wither and then 
 remove the pancreases instead they could simply use the whole pancreases of cattle although this meant that the idea that 
 had originally inspired banting had led up a blind alley it also meant that they could produce much larger amounts 
 of extract than before thanks to the ready availability of bovine pancreases from the slaughterhouse banting and best had also 
 begun using the shaffer hartman technique of blood sugar determination 0:determina 0:tion possibly at collip s suggestion in december 19 
 21 macleod finally 0:fi 0:nally agreed to allow collip to join the work 18 collip eagerly launched himself into both 
 the biochemical and physiological 0:physi 0:ological aspects of the question his first misstep was to ask the young worker at 
 the abattoir for sweetbreads instead of pancreases sweetbreads 0:sweet 0:breads can mean the thymus as well as the pancreas after 
 this embarrassing 0:embar 
 the discovery of insulin 1921 1922 27 rassing problem was sorted out he progressed very quickly beginning by following up 
 on macleod s suggestion that the extract of pancreas be tried on rabbits particularly those that were depancreatized collip soon 
 determined that the extract lowered the blood sugar not only of depancreatized rabbits but also of normal rabbits this discovery 
 meant that the group now had a quick and easy way of testing the activity 0:ac 0:tivity of a batch 
 of extract simply by injecting normal rabbits after consulting with banting best and macleod collip then tested whether injections of 
 the extract had an effect on the formation of glycogen in the liver and the excretion of ketone bodies in 
 the urine diabetes interferes 0:inter 0:feres with the usual metabolism of glucose and fatty acids glucose is normally converted to 
 a storage form glycogen that is stored in the liver in diabetics this important process does not occur and moreover 
 fatty acids are only partially metabolized leaving an intermediate form ketone bodies to accumulate in the urine if the pancreatic 
 extract could be shown to restore the function of converting glucose to glycogen 0:glyco 0:gen and to eliminate ketone bodies 
 in the urine this would be an additional 0:addi 0:tional indication that the extract served to replace the factor missing 
 in diabetics on 21 december a few short weeks after starting the work collip observed that when he injected a 
 depancreatized dog with the extract its urine was free of ketone bodies when he dissected the dog he found that 
 its liver was full of glycogen these experiments were very significant they took the experimental proof of the extract s 
 potency beyond the blood and urine sugar readings that banting and best had depended upon up to this point changes 
 in blood sugar might easily be attributed to other causes such as the toxicity of the extract collip s 0:col 
 0:lip 0:s experiments demonstrated clearly that the extract actually acted on the key metabolic functions that were missing in the 
 diabetic l 9 during the christmas break banting best macleod and collip travelled 0:trav 0:elled down to new haven connecticut 
 to report their findings at the meeting of the american physiological society there banting gave his and best s first 
 public presentation on the subject the response of the attending scientists seems to have been one of cautious interest they 
 had some serious questions that the toronto group would have to answer if they were to make their results fully 
 convincing unpolished awkward and inexperienced banting had a difficult time defending his work in front of the audience of physiological 
 experts at a crucial moment macleod stepped in to respond to the questions and to rescue the presentation 0:presen 0:tation 
 this only humiliated and angered banting sparking his suspicion that macleod was trying to take credit for the work of 
 the group zo collip on the other hand was very hopeful about his own research and working vigorously in january 
 1922 he conveyed his tremendous 
 28 j b collip excitement in a letter to tory and perhaps betting that his research success might be an 
 additional bargaining chip he again sued for better terms he thanked the president for his latest offer and admitted that 
 he had been on the verge of accepting it when he had on that same day been offered the chair 
 of biochemistry at dalhousie and later a research 0:re 0:search post at toronto sweetened with 500 from a special rockefeller 
 0:rock 0:efeller fund he suggested that since the university of alberta had a similar rockefeller fund his salary might be 
 topped off with a similar contribution he argued that given geography and his plans to attend some important international meetings 
 the following year any alberta salary was worth 500 less than the same amount from toronto on a more positive 
 note collip recounted the results of his research which vindicated he believed his decision to stay with macleod i will 
 never regret having decided to spend a year near professor macleod the crucial experiment was tried out just before the 
 xmas break and the results were so striking that even the most sceptical i think would be convinced i have 
 never had such an absolutely satisfactory experience before namely going in a logical way from point to point into an 
 unexplored field building absolutely solid structure 0:struc 0:ture all the way however to make a long story short we have 
 obtained from the pancreas of animals a mysterious something which when injected into totally diabetic 0:di 0:abetic dogs completely removes 
 all the cardinal symptoms of the disease just at the moment it is my problem to isolate in a form 
 suitable for human administration 0:administra 0:tion the principle which has such wondrous powers the existence of which many have suspected 
 but no one has hitherto proved if the substance works on the human 0:hu 0:man it will be a great 
 boon to medicine but even if it does not work out a milestone 0:mile 0:stone has at least been added 
 to the field of carbohydrate metabolism to be associated in an intimate way with the solution of a problem which 
 for years has resisted all efforts was something i had never anticipated i only wish that the various papers which 
 will be published on this work were coming from alberta rather than toronto a whole new field has been thrown 
 open however and i will continue to work along these lines for some time no doubt 21 he closed on 
 a conciliatory note heartily thanking tory for the concessions 0:con 0:cessions made to him by the board i have been 
 in the west long enough to have imbibed the western spirit i am desirous of returning to it even though 
 it may not present all the immediate advantages offered 0:of 0:fered in the east zz tory replied congratulating collip on 
 being associated with such a weighty problem especially one connected with human health this was precisely what he tory had 
 wished when he had contacted the rockefeller people as for the terms of collip s post though no better offer 
 could be made 23 
 the discovery of insulin 192 1 192 2 29 l 1 in the meantime the research work had been progressing 
 at a rapid rate banting was beginning to feel pushed aside by the professional researchers 0:re 0:searchers macleod and collip 
 in his anxiety he persuaded macleod and duncan graham eaton professor of medicine at the university and head of medicine 
 at the toronto general hospital to allow a clinical 0:clini 0:cal trial of the extract that he and best had 
 made the test of 11 january 0:janu 0:ary proved a failure the extract had only a small effect on the 
 blood sugar of the patient and because it contained impurities it caused a sterile abscess at the point of injection 
 this premature clinical trial became 0:be 0:came yet another source of friction among the members of the group although they 
 had all pooled their results previously banting was turning 0:turn 0:ing his and best s work on purification into a 
 competition with collip s work 24 around this date collip made another very significant discovery he had observed that a 
 large dose of the extract sometimes caused his rabbits 0:rab 0:bits to go into convulsions the wretched animals would shake 
 violently 0:vio 0:lently then collapse only to have seizures again and again every fifteen minutes until they finally died when 
 collip first encountered these convulsions his initial assumption was that the extract must be toxic in some way observing a 
 convulsing rabbit one day he suddenly had another 0:an 0:other idea he quickly drew a sample of blood and set 
 it aside then he grabbed some glucose mixed it with water and injected the animal with the solution the rabbit 
 recovered when collip later analysed the hastily drawn blood sample he confirmed what he had suspected there had been almost 
 no sugar in the rabbit s bloodstream he had discovered the phenomenon that would later be called insulin shock the 
 extra large dose of extract had caused the body to empty too much of the sugar from the blood collip 
 s glucose injection had countered this by raising the blood sugar to a more normal level this story comes from 
 o h gaebler who witnessed the events he commented it all looks simple now but it was the most thinking 
 per square meter per minute that i have seen z5 after that dramatic demonstration collip was always very careful to 
 warn clinicians of the potential danger of insulin 0:in 0:sulin overdose amidst all the excitement in the laboratory collip had 
 to deal with some grave problems at home the new baby barbara went from illness 0:ill 0:ness to illness first 
 she had rickets then diphtheria and by winter she had come down with pneumonia at one point collip worried that 
 she might die then ray and both daughters succumbed to the flu to avoid getting sick himself bert enlisted his 
 sister in law maude to serve as nurse to his young family while he camped out in the lab on 
 a cot alas poor maude came down with the flu herself while caring for the collips i 6 
 j b collip 30 collip was thus conveniently set up to work both night and day he continued with his 
 most important task of purifying the extract for clinical use on 19 january he found himself once again alone in 
 the laboratory still working on the problem he had been experimenting with various solvents in an attempt to separate the 
 active principle from contaminants in the crude extract on this night he fiddled with different concentrations of alcohol he found 
 that he could get most of the contaminants to drop out of solution by increasing the concentration 0:concen 0:tration of 
 the alcohol finally he increased the alcohol solution to a concentration of 90 per cent suddenly the elusive active principle 
 precipitated 0:pre 0:cipitated out in pure form beside himself with excitement collip ran up and down the empty corridors he 
 telephoned ray to tell her that he had it collip s success as marvellous as it was for the project 
 sparked a confrontation with his co workers sometime during the next few days although there are no contemporary accounts of 
 what happened historian 0:his 0:torian michael bliss was able to piece together some of the story from versions recorded by 
 banting and best decades later it appears that banting was threatened by the thought that his work was being taken 
 away from him just as it was coming to fruition collip perhaps wary of banting s distrustful attitude announced that 
 he had discovered how to purify the principle and that he did not intend to share his secret with banting 
 and best he might even take out a patent on it banting already insecure was pushed beyond his limits the 
 two men had an angry confrontation and almost came to blows clark noble a student and research assistant to macleod 
 drew a cartoon now lost entitled the discovery of insulin it showed banting sitting on top of collip choking him 
 shortly after on 23 january a clinical test was made of collip s extract this time the results were clearly 
 positive 18 for those of us at the beginning of the twenty first century a time when diabetes is generally 
 thought of as a chronic but not fatal condition 0:condi 0:tion it is perhaps difficult to fully appreciate the drama 
 of this achievement 0:achieve 0:ment until 192 2 a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus was a death sentence young children stricken 
 with the disease could expect to live only a few years their bodies unable to utilize the carbohydrates they ingested 
 would gradually waste away the glucose passed through the body unused 0:un 0:used making the patient urinate frequently and be 
 consumed by a fierce thirst and hunger the excess sugars in the blood would slowly poison the body sometimes resulting 
 in blindness foot and leg infections and even gangrene the best treatment that diabetologists had been able to develop was 
 a stringent low calorie low carbohydrate diet patients able to adhere to these diets might be able to buy a 
 few months even a few more years of life but would slowly steadily starve to death if they 
 the discovery of insulin 1911 1922 313 1 i 1 did not die of diabetes in the spring of 1922 
 the toronto group and their clinical collaborators began to test insulin on more and more patients 0:pa 0:tients some sufferers 
 came to them almost living skeletons the lucky ones who received insulin in time responded by gradually regaining weight strength 
 and vitality clinical photographs show a stark contrast 0:con 0:trast between the diabetic children before treatment emaciated and listless and 
 their robust even chubby selves full of life only months later all because of insulin michael bliss calls it the 
 closest approach to the resurrection of the body that our secular society can achieve l 9 a few days after 
 the clinical trial of his extract collip wrote to tory telling him that he would be pleased to accept the 
 terms that tory had set out he related the news of the phenomenal break in his research 0:re 0:search the 
 problem seemed almost hopeless so you can imagine my delight when about midnight one day last week i discovered a 
 way to get the active principle free from all the muck with which it appeared to be inseparably bound since 
 the clinical trial had proved so encouraging 0:encour 0:aging 5 000 was immediately put at the disposal of the team 
 to secure apparatus and four assistants to rush the work and try to build a block of clinical evidence on 
 the advice of macleod and others collip kept the process a secret until it was fully tested if the material 
 proved satisfactory 0:satis 0:factory he would direct the planning of the manufacturing process with the university s connaught laboratories 30 
 bringing insulin to the world it was now clear that the discovery was of immense importance macleod turned over the 
 resources of his department to the project and on 25 january the group signed a formal agreement to work collaboratively 
 0:col 0:laboratively with the connaught anti toxin laboratories the connaught 0:con 0:naught labs had been set up in 19 14 
 to produce vaccines and antitoxins for public health use banting best macleod and collip agreed that none of them would 
 attempt to patent the product independently the step of formally setting down the principles of cooperation was probably 0:proba 0:bly 
 precipitated by the angry and confusing confrontation between best and collip of that week their antagonism had underlined the need 
 to spell out the technical and financial details of the collaborative work 3l collip dropped the rest of his sabbatical 
 plans and devoted himself to the problem of the large scale manufacture of the extract now officially 0:offi 0:cially named 
 insulin after the initial excitement was over the mood in the laboratory turned bleak for several months biologically active extracts 
 are notoriously 0:notori 0:ously finicky to make and soon after his great triumph collip discovered 0:discov 0:ered that he could 
 no longer make the potent extract it is difficult to 
 j b collip 32 determine why there was a problem variations in vacuum pressure temperature and distilling time can all 
 wreak havoc on a temperamental 0:temperamen 0:tal extract also collip s casual way of note taking may not have helped 
 he tended to jot down the details of his extraction recipes in a little black notebook that he kept in 
 his back pocket eventually he banting and best recovered the ability to make insulin 0:insu 0:lin but they were also 
 forced to recognize the limitations of their operation 0:oper 0:ation the work at the connaught laboratories had been fraught with 
 difficulties by may the news of their work had drawn the attention of many in the medical world and banting 
 and macleod were now deluged 0:del 0:uged with heart breaking appeals for supplies of insulin production at the connaught could 
 not keep up with the growing demand the group decided to accept the invitation of the pharmaceutical firm eli lilly 
 company to collaborate in the work lilly could offer the research 0:re 0:search staff facilities and funds that the toronto 
 group would not have access to otherwise lilly s research director george clowes was himself a research chemist and had 
 been very interested in the toronto group s work from the time he had heard banting deliver his paper at 
 new haven the question of whether a physician should profit from the sale of a medical product caused considerable debate 
 during this period macleod 0:mac 0:leod and banting were concerned about contravening medical ethics by patenting their discovery but they 
 also recognized that if they did not do so they risked losing control of insulin to a competitor in april 
 the group decided to apply for a patent in the names of collip and best and then assign the patent 
 to the university the next month the group hammered out an agreement with lilly that gave the company the rights 
 to manufacture and sell insulin in the united states and central and south america the firm was given an exclusive 
 licence for a period 0:pe 0:riod of one year during which information on any improvements was to be pooled between 
 the toronto group and lilly large scale clinical trials would be made in toronto and the united states and lilly 
 would provide the extract for these tests free of charge at first and later at cost in britain and the 
 rest of the empire the patent rights were to be offered to the british medical research council the university board 
 of governors set up a committee later to be called the insulin committee 0:com 0:mittee to deal with managing the 
 patent and licensing process the patent application had initially been made in the names of collip and best because they 
 were the two non medical members of the group later banting was persuaded to add his name as well because 
 the patent was at risk of being voided on the grounds that collip and best were not the sole inventors 
 the american patent was issued on 23 january 0:jan 0:uary 192 3 and the canadian and british patents were also 
 awarded 3i 
 the discovery of insulin 1921 19x2 33 at the end of may 1922 the members of the group read papers 
 at the meeting of the royal society of canada 33 the insulin team then broke up as collip s appointment 
 at toronto was ending in early june best and collip travelled down to the eli lilly headquarters in indianapolis 0:in 
 0:dianapolis to share their knowledge of producing insulin with the lilly staff and to help with the first attempts at 
 extraction collip returned to edmonton shortly afterward to take on his new position as the chair of the department of 
 biochemistry he had been privileged to participate in what was the most important achievement in canadian medical research collip s 
 contribution had been vital to the success of the toronto group banting and best admitted that before 0:be 0:fore collip 
 s arrival their results had been no better than those of previous 0:pre 0:vious investigators in finding a way to 
 purify insulin and then to demonstrate its physiological activity collip had taken their work beyond 0:be 0:yond what had been 
 achieved by the several other researchers who had tackled the problem before collip had made several important contributions 0:contri 0:butions 
 to the understanding of insulin s physiological effects he developed 0:devel 0:oped an assay for insulin in normal rabbits he 
 identified the hypoglycaemic reaction and he showed that insulin helped restore the body s ability to store glycogen and to 
 eliminate ketosis michael bliss argues that without collip s work insulin might well have been isolated 0:iso 0:lated somewhere else 
 34 while the interactions of the four principal participants in the insulin work had been bitter and fractious at times 
 it was nevertheless their collaboration that had led to their success now only a few months short of his thirtieth 
 birthday collip returned to alberta his career transformed the discovery of insulin had become 0:be 0:come the event that would 
 define the rest of his professional life 
 3 the parathyroid hormone controversy 1923 1927 a question of priority this is the one big thing in my life 
 and it means everything to me to be given credit for my discovery you will realize i am sure that 
 i consider it no trifling matter when i am wrapped up in it heart and soul it is far more 
 than a question of money it is immortality adolph m hanson to harvey cushing 15 april 1925 1 collip s 
 career had taken a dramatic turn with the discovery of insulin from that point on he would be assured a 
 place in the research world but now he had to capitalize on the advantages he had gained over the next 
 years he worked assiduously to create another triumph like insulin 0:insu 0:lin his research program turning decisively towards the extraction 
 and characterization of hormones of therapeutic value in his pursuit of this goal he demonstrated the many lessons he had 
 learned from his toronto 0:to 0:ronto experience when collip returned to the university of alberta in the summer of 1922 
 he knew that his circumstances were greatly changed from those he had left the year before in toronto the insulin 
 discovery was gaining 0:gain 0:ing wide public attention and attracting many diabetics to the city although 0:al 0:though banting had 
 found himself somewhat on the sidelines during the later development of insulin in the laboratory he now established a central 
 place for himself in the clinical use of the hormone banting was the figure that patients and their doctors would 
 associate with this new treatment and his supporters in the medical community were successful 0:success 0:ful in ensuring that to 
 the world the names banting and best were synonymous with the insulin discovery despite this collip gained recognition from his 
 peers in medical science 0:sci 0:ence as well as from his fellow western canadians who regarded him as a local 
 hero to westerners it was regional bias that led to the neglect 0:ne 0:glect of their man by the toronto 
 medical establishment and the eastern 0:east 0:ern press 2 collip was applauded by medical groups and celebrated in local papers 
 he was honoured at a special banquet in edmonton and 
 the parathyroid hormone controversy 1923 1927 35 at a luncheon in calgary the university of alberta awarded him its highest 
 degree a doctorate of science then in october 1923 the nobel prize was awarded to banting and macleod this was 
 the first time the prize had been given to north americans banting whose enmity with macleod had intensified was furious 
 that he had to share the award with macleod and that his loyal friend charlie best had been neglected banting 
 immediately made the public gesture of sharing half his prize with best in a dramatic move macleod followed suit by 
 announcing that he would share his prize with collip to indicate that collip s contribution had been equal to that 
 of the others 3 although collip was personally hurt by the quarrels that had marred the triumph of the discovery 
 and although he failed to receive as much credit for his contribution as banting and best had for theirs his 
 association 0:asso 0:ciation with the achievement proved to be a tremendous boost to his career donations and grants poured in 
 these funds allowed him to follow up on his insulin work and to hire a research assistant the college 0:col 
 0:lege of physicians and surgeons of alberta donated 9 000 to his research 0:re 0:search efforts the rockefeller foundation awarded 
 him 5 000 and the carnegie foundation gave 10 000 more significantly collip like banting best and the university of 
 toronto had a share of the insulin royalties over the next decades an era before large scale government funding was 
 available these royalties would prove to be a substantial and relatively reliable source of research funds for the three discoverers 
 0:discover 0:ers as early as 1925 collip s portion of the royalties amounted to 8 000 4 next steps at 
 the alberta medical faculty important steps were being taken to upgrade 0:up 0:grade scientific and clinical teaching the medical course 
 was expanded to a six year full degree granting program in 1922 just nine years after 0:af 0:ter it had 
 opened the school received a class a rating from the american 0:ameri 0:can medical association am a council on medical 
 education and hospitals that same year the urgently needed new medical building was completed upon his return to edmonton collip 
 was able to move out of the old power house and into his new quarters there the biochemistry 0:bio 0:chemistry 
 department was located on the west half of the third floor while anatomy was on the east half collip found 
 his new laboratory space a great improvement over the makeshift accommodations he had had before he had even gained a 
 spacious animal room that was well lit heated and ventilated soon however his expanding research program was stretching even these 
 
 36 j b collip facilities to the limit the animal room was scarcely sufficient for the several hundred dogs he 
 went through in a year let alone for all the rabbits and other small animals by 1926 the crowded conditions 
 and somewhat disorganized laboratory management were causing problems 0:prob 0:lems a dog tethered to a desk wreaked havoc in the 
 laboratory sinks were allowed to get dirty and overflow flooding the laboratory a floor below solving these problems called for 
 some quick improvisation collip even considered using the lecture room next to his office to house his small animals s 
 collip s first interest upon returning to alberta was to manufacture insulin for clinical use and to oversee continued experiments 
 on it confident of the importance of his work he made it clear to president tory that he expected alberta 
 to match the good facilities he had enjoyed 0:en 0:joyed at toronto as the problem i am now working on 
 is such a big one and of such practical importance i will be only able to give it proper attention 
 if i have adequate assistance 6 he soon began work on an insulin like substance that he extracted from plants 
 this substance 0:sub 0:stance glucokinin as he called it looked tremendously promising as an alternative source of insulin tory was 
 dedicated to fostering research in all university departments 0:depart 0:ments in an equitable manner but he now had to accept 
 that the work of his most illustrious faculty member would have to receive special attention 0:at 0:tention he reported to 
 the rockefeller foundation in 1923 as you know dr collip is continuing his work in connection with insulin and glucokinin 
 and we are getting for him from special sources the money that is required to make his work all it 
 ought to be 7 for example unlike 0:un 0:like the members of other departments collip received a lot of assistance 
 0:assis 0:tance in the meantime there was very little extra funding for anyone else ralph shaner was an anatomist from 
 the harvard medical school who according to elise corbet s history of the university s medical faculty 0:fac 0:ulty worked 
 quietly and diligently for many years and gained an international reputation in cardiac embryology in sharp contrast to collip he 
 had little financial support and had to make do with small grants of 150 in 1932 from the banting research 
 foundation and 75 in 1935 from the carnegie corporation 8 collip continued to benefit from his association with his mentor 
 a b macallum macallum served as the first chairman of the national research council in 1917 and then took up 
 the chair of biochemistry at mcgill university in 1920 he supported collip s nomination to a fellowship in the royal 
 society of canada as early as 1922 but in 1925 collip still had not been elected when macallum noted that 
 collip s name was left off the list of nominees by mistake it was later discovered he was furious he 
 threatened to ask his own son 
 the parathyroid hormone controversy 19 23 1 9 27 37 v 1 a bruce macallum to withdraw his name from 
 nomination because he felt it was unjust that the younger macallum be considered when collip was not 9 in 1924 
 sir arthur currie principal of mcgill university wrote to collip in confidence to ask if he would consider joining the 
 department 0:depart 0:ment of biochemistry as second under a b macallum currie promised 0:prom 0:ised that collip would assume the 
 chair after macallum s retirement he suggested i know you are head of the department at edmonton but yet i 
 feel you would not regard joining a department presided over by macallum who is the doyen of bio chemists as 
 something which your prestige would not allow you to do 10 collip declined the invitation 0:invita 0:tion explaining that he 
 preferred to live in a smaller city now that he had a young family his third child a son john 
 was born in 1924 moreover he continued to be perfectly frank i wish to remain at alberta 0:al 0:berta for 
 some little time yet i have spent a number of years now in building up a department and it is 
 only now that i have a satisfactory organization i would therefore like to be enabled to reap the benefits of 
 this he outlined his terms i take it that the post which you suggest 0:sug 0:gest is a teaching post 
 in his department i have already gone through quite a mill of teaching and am now enjoying what is practically 
 a research 0:re 0:search post since i have sufficient staff to handle most of the arduous work of teaching if 
 at a later date a research post should become available 0:avail 0:able at mcgill and you should then care to 
 consider me i would be very glad to consider an offer 11 the discovery of insulin had been a turning 
 point in collip s career having had a taste of research that so directly and dramatically saved human lives he 
 found he could not return to his more abstract studies of leeches and clams he moved away from general physiology 
 and biochemistry 0:bio 0:chemistry from the investigation of fundamental processes in a wide range of organisms and devoted his attention 
 to the investigation of hormones particularly those of value in medical therapeutics as a sign of this new orientation he 
 enrolled as a medical student at alberta this no doubt created a somewhat awkward situation for his instructors since he 
 was a fellow faculty member and department head of course collip was not required to take the basic science courses 
 but he had to complete the final two years of the six year program he received his md in 1926 
 but he had to graduate one year after the rest of his class because 0:be 0:cause he hadn t assisted 
 in enough deliveries to pass his course in obstetrics 0:obstet 0:rics and gynaecology 12 in his subsequent investigations collip followed 
 the pattern established 0:estab 0:lished in the insulin work in the laboratory he honed the skills that he had used 
 so effectively in the chemical extraction of the hormone and in the physiological assay of its effects his insulin experience 
 had also 
 38 j b collip taught him the value of patenting the products he developed and of collaborating 0:col 0:laborating with 
 pharmaceutical firms when he discovered new principles 0:princi 0:ples he sought arrangements for their production similar to those that the 
 insulin group had made with eli lilly glukokinin collip s first venture was to find a source of insulin other 
 than slaughterhouse 0:slaugh 0:terhouse animals he was not alone in this search macleod clark noble 0:no 0:ble and n a 
 mccormick investigated the teleost fish as a source best and d a scott looked into plant tissues these researches caused 
 some concern at eli lilly and its scientists began to investigate many alternate 0:alter 0:nate sources of insulin as well 
 13 collip returned to an organism with which he was already familiar the clam mya arenaria he postulated that since 
 insulin served to convert glucose to glycogen a hormone similar to insulin would be present wherever glycogen appeared in nature 
 0:na 0:ture the clam was one lower animal that was rich in glycogen in december 0:de 0:cember 1922 collip returned 
 to toronto to attend the meeting of the american society of biological chemists and the american physiological 0:physiologi 0:cal society 
 there he and his insulin colleagues presented papers on their insulin work collip also presented his first paper on this 
 insulinlike 0:insulin 0:like substance he reported that he had used the same method of extraction 0:ex 0:traction on clam tissue 
 as he had used in insulin extraction and had produced a preparation that caused a normal rabbit to go into 
 convulsions 0:convul 0:sions upon injection as with insulin these convulsions were relieved by the injection of sugar when he used 
 a modified version of the extraction 0:ex 0:traction method the blood sugar did not fall until several days after the 
 administration of the extract and sometimes only after an actual rise in blood sugar 14 collip speculated that there might 
 be similarities between the plant and animal kingdom and he turned to a more readily available organism 0:organ 0:ism yeast 
 on 26 january 1923 after many months of failure he finally 0:fi 0:nally succeeded in preparing a yeast extract that 
 produced marked hypoglycaemia in normal rabbits when he injected a depancreatized dog with the extract its blood sugar fell to 
 a normal level and its urine was sugar free encouraged by this success he extended the work to plants that 
 did not contain glycogen or starch he was soon busily extracting 0:ex 0:tracting everything from onion tops and onion roots 
 to barley roots sprouted grain green wheat leaves bean tops and lettuce in march he announced that his new plant 
 hormone was to be called glucokinin he stated emphatically that this new hormone will be useful in the treatment of 
 diabetes mellitus in the human subject there can be little doubt in fact he claimed this substance would in some 
 ways be 
 the parathyroid hormone controversy 1923 1927 39 v y much superior to insulin because the effect took more time to 
 develop and lasted longer ls that same month the cambridge team of l b winter and w smith announced that 
 they had independently obtained similar results with yeast extracts anxious not to lose credit for this new work collip cabled 
 off a note to nature in april explaining the course of his studies and arguing that winter and smith shared 
 coincident 0:coinci 0:dent priority with him 16 in toronto macleod was sceptical about the value of these findings he worried 
 that collip had foolishly rushed his results into print before working through the other possible interpretations of the results for 
 example the hypoglycaemic effect might have been caused by damage to the liver or the glucokinin might have been stimulating 
 the normal rabbit s own pancreas to produce more insulin he was particularly annoyed 0:an 0:noyed that collip had so 
 hastily made a claim to priority with winter and smith 17 by april collip too realized that there were problems 
 with his experiments the public claims he now made about glucokinin began to sound more provisional he noted that some 
 of the extracts had been toxic and that when the toxicity problem had been overcome through the use of weaker 
 extracts the hypoglycaemic effect was less striking the blood sugar measurements had looked promising but when he had attempted to 
 measure the glycogen content of the liver he found that there was none furthermore the extract caused an initial rise 
 in the amount of sugar excreted in the urine and only after that did the urine become free of sugar 
 the action of glucokinin proved quite different from that of insulin with insulin the fall in blood sugar occurred 0:oc 
 0:curred shortly after injection and reached its low point two to six hours later glucokinin sometimes took days to take 
 effect because of a lack of apparatus and time collip was not able to conduct the tests of respiratory 0:respi 
 0:ratory quotient and ketone excretion tests that had been so important in characterizing the effect of insulin he admitted in 
 a paper the author 0:au 0:thor fully realizes that the experiments herein set forth are far from complete as yet 
 and therefore not without criticism but the results so far obtained have been so uniform in character that a preliminary 
 paper 0:pa 0:per on the work done to date seemed justified as for the clinical use of glucokinin he reported 
 that extracts of such purity had been produced 0:pro 0:duced that an actual test on a diabetic subject was planned 
 but remarked 0:re 0:marked that the therapeutic value of the hormone remained to be demonstrated 18 collip continued with a 
 long term experiment that involved keeping a depancreatized dog alive with glucokinin extract as banting and best had with insulin 
 the effects of a single injection seemed to persist for so long that collip feared that a small piece of 
 pancreas might have been left in the animal and was continuing to regulate the blood sugar 
 j b collip 40 the animal died at the end of sixty six days and a post mortem examination 0:exam 
 0:ination performed by daniel revell professor of anatomy seemed to vindicate collip revell could find no trace of pancreas upon 
 gross examination 0:ex 0:amination by june however collip admitted that he had lost faith in the experiment and that clinical 
 trials would be postponed until more facts about the physiological response could be determined l 9ln demonstrating 0:dem 0:onstrating that 
 glucokinin had an effect on blood sugar collip had progressed only as far as banting and best had with insulin 
 before collip had joined the team collip was well aware that blood sugar changes might be induced by all sorts 
 of other substances including toxic ones his final full paper on the subject was submitted in june in it he 
 pursued an interesting phenomenon that he had uncovered while working 0:work 0:ing with glucokinin after an animal developed hypoglycaemia following 
 0:follow 0:ing an injection of glucokinin he took a blood sample and injected it into a second animal he observed 
 that the second animal quickly became hypoglycaemic as well when he separated the blood components 0:compo 0:nents he found that 
 the same effect could be created by transferring the blood serum portion alone he also found that the principle could 
 be transmitted through a series of animals furthermore this transmission effect occurred even when the initial hypoglycaemia was caused by 
 substances 0:sub 0:stances other than glucokinin the animals experienced the typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia such as weakness and convulsions but 
 unlike insulin shock these symptoms were relieved only for a short time by the administration of glucose and the ultimate 
 result was always 0:al 0:ways death he named this phenomenon animal passage hypoglycaemia 0:hypoglycae 0:mia 20 after this paper he 
 remained silent on the subject for a time he continued to search for the answer to this strange problem but 
 eventually he moved on to other subjects four years later he published a note admitting that he had never been 
 able to duplicate his earlier results 0:re 0:sults he felt it his duty to report that he now believed that 
 the effect must have been caused by an organism transmitted in the serum zi after the disappointment of glucokinin collip 
 published very little for almost a year in the summer of 192 4 he again travelled to nanaimo 0:nan 0:aimo 
 to study the effect of insulin on the oxygen consumption of marine 0:ma 0:rine fish and invertebrates iz otherwise his 
 research program became devoted almost exclusively to mammalian subjects in particular the special problems of human physiology and health the 
 parathyroid hormone collip s next venture was the isolation of the parathyroid hormone 23 this work added a new triumph 
 to his record but also embroiled him 
 the parathyroid hormone controversy 1923 1927 41 i y in a bitter priority dispute with a minnesota physician adolph hanson 
 0:han 0:son in many ways this fight was reminiscent of the insulin turmoil m during the late nineteenth and early 
 twentieth centuries the study of the endocrine glands emerged as an experimental science breaking away from the practice of organotherapy 
 merriley borell argues that this development was accompanied by a gradual change in methodology 0:methodol 0:ogy 2 5 in the 
 organotherapeutic tradition the internal secretions of the glands were thought of as potential treatments for disease and their presence was 
 indicated by clinical results in the new science of endocrinology 0:endo 0:crinology hormones were conceptualized as chemical messengers and their 
 presence was proven by the production of standard physiological and biochemical changes in experimental animals diana long hall argues that 
 the tension between these two approaches constituted a major theme in the history of endocrinology and continued to play a 
 role in shaping related intellectual and institutional matters into the 1920s z6 even as the new science was establishing an 
 institutional basis however 0:how 0:ever expectations for the therapeutic value of the internal secretions outran scientific understanding not only was 
 organotherapy exploited by quacks and charlatans it was also widely and uncritically applied by enthusiastic physicians in britain and america 
 laboratory scientists strove to distance themselves from this side of endocrinology by emphasizing 0:em 0:phasizing the physiological bases for these 
 organotherapeutic cures the discovery of insulin and its use in the treatment of diabetes mellitus brought a new legitimacy to 
 hormone therapy stimulating large scale research on the hormones of the other glands there were already extracts of the hormones 
 adrenalin and thyroxin but the discovery of insulin had a particularly dramatic impact offering the first real hormone 0:hor 0:mone 
 treatment for a disease that was neither rare nor readily controlled 0:con 0:trolled in the 1920s and 19305 the isolation 
 of new hormones became the focus of such intense competition that research in this field was likened to a gold 
 rush 27 the rise of the science based pharmaceutical industry the science based pharmaceutical industry was also becoming an important 
 0:im 0:portant factor in medical research by the 1920s some of the larger firms had built sizable research staffs these 
 firms were beginning to regard scientific research and development as a way of gaining legitimacy 0:legit 0:imacy and a competitive 
 advantage in the marketplace their scientific 0:scien 0:tific activities helped to differentiate them from the vendors of quack remedies 18 
 
 j b collip 42 collaborative ventures between industry and academic scientists could yield benefits for both parties an academic scientist 
 who discovered 0:dis 0:covered a new therapeutic agent and wished to apply it to practice required the assistance of a 
 pharmaceutical firm since universities seldom 0:sel 0:dom had the facilities to manufacture drugs on a large scale the firms were 
 able to provide the research staff and resources to help in developing 0:develop 0:ing the rudimentary product to a form 
 in which it could be industrially produced the academic scientists and their universities were also able to apply royalties to 
 the support of research this was particularly important 0:im 0:portant in an era before large scale government funding of medical 
 research 0:re 0:search in return the pharmaceutical houses could profit greatly from the inventiveness and expertise of the university scientists 
 the cooperation 0:cooper 0:ation between the university of toronto and eli lilly company in the development of insulin was a 
 celebrated example of successful collaboration l 9 during this period greater numbers of medical scientists and pharmaceutical 0:phar 0:maceutical firms 
 began to use the patent system to protect their products 0:prod 0:ucts the issue of whether to patent medical products 
 was a new and difficult one for both academic scientists and industry as the medical ethics of the time demanded 
 that medical products be donated to the common fund of knowledge and not be used for profit attitudes of medical 
 scientists towards medical patents began to change one motivating 0:mo 0:tivating factor was their desire to protect the public by 
 controlling how the product was to be exploited another was their wish to keep the profits for further research the 
 course taken by the toronto group handing the insulin patents over to the university became an increasingly accepted way of 
 accomplishing these goals 3o the administrators 0:ad 0:ministrators of these patents could exert some measure of control over the price 
 manufacture and distribution of the product while adding to the research funds of the university collip s extract before 192 
 4 investigators had demonstrated that when the parathyroid 0:parathy 0:roid glands were surgically removed the patient would experience generalized 0:gen 
 0:eralized muscle contractions tetany and die in clinical practice this was of concern because parathyroid glands were sometimes accidentally 0:acciden 
 0:tally damaged or removed in thyroid surgery for goitre the most common 0:com 0:mon treatment for tetany and an effective 
 one was calcium salts taken by mouth other researchers attempted to treat tetany with extracts or grafts of the parathyroid 
 gland as well several commercial preparations 0:prepara 0:tions of desiccated parathyroid products were also available although most of them were 
 of dubious value 3l 
 the parathyroid hormone controversy 192 3 19z7 43 the two chief theories concerning the function of the parathyroid glands were 
 1 that these glands had a role in the regulation of calcium metabolism and z that they detoxified methyl guanidine 
 a poison that was an end product of bacterial putrefaction in the intestines in 1909 william maccallum and carl voegtlin 
 produced evidence in support 0:sup 0:port of the first theory demonstrating that parathyroid tetany could be corrected by the administration 
 of parathyroid extract or by the injection 0:injec 0:tion of calcium z noel paton and his colleagues at the university 
 of glasgow were the principal proponents of the second theory in 19 16 they produced a series of papers demonstrating 
 that the convulsions of animals with parathyroid tetany were similar to those of animals injected 0:in 0:jected with guanidine the 
 paton group s conclusions were primarily based on similarities between the animals convulsions and the clinical symptoms in humans 33 
 in mid 11 9 2 4 collip began his investigation of the parathyroid hormone what made collip interested in the 
 parathyroids one of his colleagues recalls that in the summer of 19 19 collip showed a great deal of interest 
 in this area of research after meeting noel paton in glasgow collip had also worked with leathes at sheffield on 
 the effect of sleep and awakening on the blood chemistry in the two papers collip 0:col 0:lip had published on 
 this work he tied tetany to acid base balance and calcium deficiency winter and smith with whom collip had claimed 
 coincident priority on the yeast insulin like hormone published a paper 0:pa 0:per discussing a possible relation between the pancreas 
 and the parathyroids 0:para 0:thyroids they observed that parathyroid extract seemed to augment the hypoglycaemic action of insulin 34 collip 
 began his study of the parathyroid gland by undertaking an extensive survey of the parathyroid literature paying particular attention 0:atten 
 0:tion to the debate over the calcium regulation and guanidine detoxification 0:detoxifi 0:cation theories of parathyroid function perhaps extrapolating from 
 his successful experience with insulin he decided in favour of the hypothesis 0:hypothe 0:sis that the parathyroid secreted a hormone 
 that controlled blood calcium concentration if this hormone existed he was determined to prepare it for replacement therapy 3s many 
 of collip s colleagues talked about his having something of an intuitive gift for working with proteins he seemed able 
 to sense just what solvent was called for or when a shift in the ph was needed collip 0:col 0:lip 
 also used sheer volume to optimize his chances of extracting active principles in his parathyroid studies collip worked with batches 
 of seventy five to one hundred glands at a time 36 by october 1924 he had some promising results using 
 hot hydrochloric 0:hydro 0:chloric acid he had made a crude extract that could be used to control tetany in a 
 parathyroidectomized animal in the following months he 
 j b collip 44 attempted to further purify this product by varying the alcohol and ether concentrations with isoelectric precipitations 
 and filtrations he also experimented with different methods of administering the extract this work was complicated and required a great 
 deal of animal experimentation 0:experi 0:mentation collip was fortunate to have the resources to perform dozens 0:doz 0:ens of experiments 
 on dogs but there were problems with many of the animals several never developed any sign of tetany after thyroparathyroidectomy 
 0:thyroparathy 0:roidectomy and could not be used for the experiment others died from tetany or infections collip nevertheless succeeded in 
 finding examples of complete replacement therapy in which the thyroparathyroidectomized 0:thyroparathyroidecto 0:mized dogs were maintained for many months on parathyroid 
 hormone 0:hor 0:mone treatment was withdrawn and the animals were subjected to tetany then they were given the hormone extract 
 and allowed to recover 0:re 0:cover completely this process was repeated many times 37 these tests proved that the extract 
 could be used successfully in replacement 0:re 0:placement therapy but collip went further he provided evidence that the relief of 
 tetany coincided with a rise in the serum calcium level furthermore 0:fur 0:thermore he tested the effect of the extract 
 on normal animals and discovered 0:dis 0:covered that it elevated the level of blood calcium an administered overdose led to 
 profound hypercalcemia and sometimes death collip and his research associate the chemist e p clark recognized that it was critically 
 important to be able to measure slight changes in blood calcium levels one of their most notable achievements and one 
 of the keys to their success was the development of an accurate quantitative method to determine serum calcium 3b while 
 collip was primarily concerned with the biochemical and physiological aspects of this work he was also mindful of the potential 
 therapeutic value of the extract only two months after his first recorded 0:re 0:corded animal experiments he had an opportunity 
 to carry out a clinical 0:clini 0:cal trial of his preparation collip and d b leitch a physician on the 
 faculty of the university of alberta reported in the canadian medical association journal that they had successfully treated a young 
 child stricken with infantile tetany they conceded however that it was difficult 0:dif 0:ficult to determine the uses and limitations 
 of the new hormone with such limited clinical data they also recommended the careful monitoring 0:monitor 0:ing of blood serum 
 calcium to avoid overdose 39 before he had even published his results collip contacted representatives 0:represen 0:tatives of eli lilly 
 company he was of course familiar with the firm having worked with lilly in the development of insulin by early 
 december 1924 collip submitted his first report to the journal of biological 0:bio 0:logical chemistry what he did not know 
 was that a minnesota physician 0:physi 0:cian named adolph hanson had developed a method of making parathyroid extract by hot 
 hydrochloric acid as well in fact hanson 
 the parathyroid hormone controversy 19 2 3 1 9 2 7 45 had taken his product to lilly several months 
 before just before collip sent off his paper george clowes director of research at eli lilly sent a telegram informing 
 him of hanson s work and urging him to make some mention of hanson s findings in his publications 4o 
 collip inserted a footnote citing hanson s papers in military surgeon he remarked that hanson s attempts to prepare an 
 active extract of the parathyroid glands of animals are worthy of great commendation and that his clinical results are indeed 
 highly suggestive 4l adolph m hanson adolph melanchton hanson 188 8 1959 was a medical practitioner who had been drawn 
 into experimental investigation out of an enthusiasm 0:enthusi 0:asm for science and a concern for his patients in this respect 
 he could be thought of as coming from a long and fine tradition during the 19205 however the archetype of 
 the lone physician scientist was being challenged by the emergence of a new profession one to which collip belonged that 
 of the career scientist associated with research institutes academic and industrial laboratories how did someone like hanson view this new 
 scientific establishment from outside its ranks hanson had received his early training at hamline university and the university of minnesota 
 he had then earned his md at northwestern 0:northwest 0:ern university in 191 1 in 19 17 he trained at 
 the school of neurosurgery 0:neurosur 0:gery at the university of pennsylvania and then went overseas with the u s army 
 medical corps he served as a surgeon at evacuation hospital 0:hos 0:pital no 8 under harvey cushing one of the 
 leading figures in american 0:ameri 0:can neurosurgery and endocrinology hanson later published several papers on the neurosurgical techniques that he 
 had developed during the war returning home after the war he settled into private practice in the town of faribault 
 minnesota in his spare time he continued to pursue his scientific interests taking first a bachelor and then a master 
 of arts degree in chemistry with e o ellingson of st olaf college in the nearby town of northfield in 
 19z2 he set up a small laboratory in the basement of his home to carry out his experiments hanson s 
 research work was very much a family enterprise his children recall taking turns at the kitchen meat grinder to help 
 him prepare an extract of the bovine thymus gland that he used to treat cancer they also remember having to 
 endure many meals made up of the surplus sweetbreads although 0:al 0:though they reported that their mother s butter and 
 cream sauces made them somewhat more palatable 4l two years before collip started his study hanson had already begun to 
 work with the parathyroid gland hanson s interest in the subject arose from his experience with thyroid operations for goitre 
 during 
 4 6 j b collip which the nearby parathyroid glands were sometimes accidentally damaged or removed hanson entered into the 
 work hoping to determine 0:deter 0:mine the chemical composition of the gland and perhaps isolate an active 0:ac 0:tive principle 
 if he succeeded in finding a new substance he intended to carry out animal experiments to test it 43 soon 
 after he began his studies hanson developed his method of hot hydrochloric acid extraction he devised the procedure by adapting 
 various standard tests of chemical composition the extract he produced 0:pro 0:duced through this method appeared to contain an organic 
 principle that he named the hydrochloric x in march and april of 192 3 he published his first papers describing 
 the chemical composition of the gland and outlining the various extracts he had derived 44 as an independent researcher hanson 
 had to spend long hours in the slaughterhouse collecting small batches of eight to twelve glands he did not have 
 the facilities to keep and use experimental animals and was therefore unable to test the physiological effect of these extracts 
 he struggled to enlist the aid of investigators in academic laboratories succeeding first with a w bell at the department 
 of pathology of the university of north dakota bell enthusiastically reported that the hydrochloric x relieved the symptoms of tetany 
 in four animals 4s in 192 4 hanson presented a paper to the minnesota branch of the society for experimental 
 biology and medicine and published several more reports in military surgeon detailing his method of preparing the extract and describing 
 bell s experiments as his research progressed hanson became more and more convinced of the value of his extract he 
 persuaded other academic researchers such as arthur hirschfelder head of the department of pharmacology edward kendall of the university 0:uni 
 0:versity of minnesota and frederick s hammett of the wistar institute to test his extract their findings were negative or 
 at best suggestive but in no way conclusive 46 while hanson clearly wanted to make his work scientifically legitimate 0:legiti 
 0:mate he lacked the expertise and resources to overcome many of the obstacles furthermore as a medical practitioner he felt 
 that the therapeutic 0:thera 0:peutic value of his work was of greater significance influenced by the ideas of h w 
 c vines m d a foulerton research student at the pathological laboratory of cambridge university hanson began to use his 
 extract on his patients he embraced vines s suggestion that parathyroid extract in addition to being useful for tetany might 
 be of value in treating such problems as infections ulcers and tuberculosis these were the sorts of ailments hanson s 
 patients brought to him daily full blown tetany on the other hand was relatively rare he had never seen a 
 case himself hanson became more and more convinced of the therapeutic value of his extract and on 18 june 1924 
 he contacted 
 the parathyroid hormone controversy 1923 1927 47 eli lilly and urged the company to take up the study of the 
 hydrochloric 0:hydrochlo 0:ric x in november that year lilly chemist h w rhodemhamel notified 0:noti 0:fied hanson that he had 
 indeed begun work on purifying the extract 47 the dispute in edmonton collip began spreading the news of his discovery 
 he published widely in canadian american and british journals and presented 0:pre 0:sented news of his work at many of 
 the key conferences of the medical and scientific professions such as those of the american physiological society the american medical 
 association the american congress on internal medicine and the national academy of science collip also continued his scientific study of 
 the hormone by april 1925 he reported that he and his associates had carried out over 250 animal 0:an 0:imal 
 experiments in their efforts to trace the physiological effects of the hormone in july of the same year he and 
 clark published an improved method of purification the extraction with boiling hydrochloric acid was followed by salting out with sodium 
 chloride and several isoelectric precipitations finally collip and clark challenged the guanidine intoxication 0:intoxi 0:cation theory of parathyroid function unlike 
 paton and his associates who had used an analogy of clinical symptoms in their argument collip and clark used direct 
 physiological means to test the theory they compared 0:com 0:pared the nitrogen and urea curves of the blood of parathyroidectomized 
 dogs with those of dogs injected with guanidine and found that the changes in blood chemistry were distinctly different they 
 argued that this was conclusive proof that parathyroid tetany was not caused by guanidine intoxication 4b collip provided other experimental 
 workers with samples of his extract 0:ex 0:tract to allow them to explore its biological activities he also supplied the 
 extract to many clinicians for clinical trials over the following year he was conservative in his estimation of the therapeutic 
 applications 0:appli 0:cations of the hormone stating that it was known to be effective only in the treatment of hypoparathyroidism 
 particularly post operative tetany post operative tetany while a rare occurrence could be sufficiently 0:suffi 0:ciently severe that treatment with 
 calcium lactate was ineffective in these cases the parathyroid hormone offered new hope although collip 0:col 0:lip had reported in 
 his early papers that the hormone was effective upon oral administration he later had to retract this claim in further 
 studies of the chemical properties of the hormone he discovered that it was rendered physiologically inert by the action of 
 the digestive enzymes 0:en 0:zymes pepsin and trypsin collip also continually warned clinicians of the danger of overdose which he 
 found could lead to death in laboratory 0:labora 0:tory animals 49 
 48 j b collip as a result of his efforts collip gradually established himself as an authority 0:au 0:thority on 
 the subject in 1927 he was asked to write an article on the parathyroid hormone for the journal of the 
 american medical association 0:associa 0:tion in its series on glandular therapy collip s paper was followed by an article by 
 william mccann written to replace the one mccann had published 0:pub 0:lished three years earlier mccann testified that three years 
 before in 1924 he had not felt that any claims for the therapeutic efficacy of parathyroid 0:para 0:thyroid preparations could 
 be justified given the published evidence these reservations extended to the early work of hanson but now in 1927 mccann 
 could assert with confidence that an effective agent was available he argued that although hanson had described the preparation 0:prepara 
 0:tion of extracts of parathyroid of which some must have contained the active principle so collip and his co workers 
 had now provided clear evidence of the method of extraction and the description of the physiological 0:physio 0:logical action of 
 a parathyroid hormone furthermore the clinical reports 0:re 0:ports confirmed the value of the collip extract as a therapeutic agent 
 51 hanson was livid when he discovered that collip s method and product were essentially identical with his own 52 
 he felt that collip had not given him proper recognition he wrote to harvey cushing explaining 0:ex 0:plaining that while 
 he did not want to deny collip his due he felt that it was only good sportsmanship that he also 
 be accorded credit for accomplishing 0:ac 0:complishing the first stage of preparing the hormone he began to feel that the 
 eli lilly firm had not dealt fairly with him as lilly s people had known of hanson s work before 
 they had taken up collip s product 0:prod 0:uct in anger hanson turned to the rival pharmaceutical firm parke davis 
 for help on 30 march 1925 he made an application for a patent for his product and immediately assigned the 
 patent rights to parke davis while hanson found the idea of patenting a medical product distasteful he felt it was 
 necessary to protect his priority he wrote passionately 0:pas 0:sionately of this to cushing this is the one big thing 
 in my life and it means everything to me to be given credit for my discovery you will realize i 
 am sure that i consider it no trifling matter when i am wrapped up in it heart and soul i 
 carried on this work as an independent investigator and paid for the expenses out of my private purse i almost 
 ruined my health and worked many times all night while i was forced to care for my practice on which 
 my livelihood depends i have no doubt that the scientific world will give me credit for my discovery but a 
 favourable decision 0:deci 0:sion by the patent office will only render this more sure it is far more than a 
 question of money it is immortality s3 hanson began to recognize the limitations of his scientific work he had depended 
 too much on his clinical findings for example that his 
 the parathyroid hormone controversy 1923 192 7 49 extract created a sense of well being and added strength and his 
 animal 0:ani 0:mal experiments had only demonstrated that the symptoms of tetany had been relieved now the value of the 
 scientific facilities and staff of parke davis became clear to strengthen his case hanson worked with the scientific staff at 
 the firm s laboratory in detroit this time in addition 0:addi 0:tion to documenting the relief of symptoms in the 
 animals treated the research team carefully measured the serum calcium at regular intervals 0:inter 0:vals axel hjort and his associates 
 at the parke davis laboratory confirmed 0:con 0:firmed both hanson s and collip s results by making detailed tests of 
 the extraction of the parathyroid by various solvents at different concentrations 0:con 0:centrations and temperatures they also set about preparing 
 a purified product carrying out the painstaking work of standardizing it and initiating 0:ini 0:tiating clinical trials s4 to collip 
 who had so recently been embroiled in the bitter controversy 0:contro 0:versy over the credit for the discovery of insulin 
 this situation must have seemed painfully familiar the parallels of the episode to the insulin 0:in 0:sulin discovery are striking 
 ss in each case collip the professional research scientist was caught in a bitter conflict with a small town physician 
 who had embarked on research work with less advanced scientific 0:sci 0:entific training banting s success like hanson s was 
 perhaps due as much to incredible perseverance as to scientific expertise both of collip s 0:col 0:lip 0:s adversaries had 
 reacted fiercely when they perceived that the credit for their work was being taken from them more significantly each of 
 them had accomplished the first stage of the extraction of the hormone and had primarily regarded the extract as a 
 therapeutic agent in both cases collip s role as a biochemist had been to purify the extract further 0:fur 0:ther 
 develop a method of biological assay and demonstrate the presence 0:pres 0:ence of the hormone through an examination of various 
 physiological responses these distinctions cannot be drawn too rigidly however banting too had demonstrated the effect of insulin on blood 
 sugar and in both the insulin and parathyroid work collip had been anxious to use his product in therapy collip 
 acknowledged hanson s work in his publications but in a manner indicating that he thought hanson had stumbled across the 
 right answer but had yet to demonstrate it satisfactorily he allowed only that hanson undoubtedly must have had some of 
 the active principle 0:prin 0:ciple in certain of his extracts since he had used the method of hydrochloric 0:hydro 0:chloric 
 acid hydrolysis s6 the lilly staff began to realize that they had a very delicate situation on their hands and 
 a very tough opponent in hanson like parke davis lilly had invested a large sum of money in purifying and 
 manufacturing 0:manu 0:facturing the product in making contacts with a considerable number of physicians and in supplying these physicians with 
 samples of the 
 j b collip 50 product by april 1925 lilly scientists had improved on the product and obtained a material purer 
 than the original collip product by three or four times and purer than the hanson product by ten times clowes 
 admitted to tory that the collip and hanson products were equal in yield and potency they differed only in that 
 the collip extract had the advantage of a somewhat lower nitrogen content if hanson were to win the patent and 
 assign the rights to parke davis lilly could very well lose its investment the firm would either have to use 
 a process that did not infringe on the patent or give up making the product altogether 0:alto 0:gether as soon 
 as clowes learned of hanson s decision to patent he wired collip strongly urging him to recognize hanson s work 
 fully and unreservedly s7 clowes warned tory that hanson was liable to make an open scandal if collip fails to 
 recognize his work or attempts to deal with him in any casual manner with the intimation that since he prepared 
 an acid extract it probably contained the active principle or anything to that effect 58 efforts at negotiation between lilly 
 and parke davis and hanson had failed hanson was so angry he explained 0:ex 0:plained to hjort that he felt 
 the time had passed for compromise he refused to have anything to do with lilly unless it severed all connections 
 0:connec 0:tions with collip with regard to the parathyroid extract 59 for a time both firms sold parathyroid extract the 
 university of alberta 0:al 0:berta board of governors agreed to allow lilly the exclusive right to manufacture and sell the 
 extract in the united states under the proprietary 0:propri 0:etary name para thor mone the university maintained the right to 
 offset any advantage of monopoly lilly might gain by fixing the price from time to time through arbitration also all 
 materials were subject to testing under collip s direction in the university laboratories 60 parke davis marketed its own product 
 under the trade name paroidin the private correspondence between hanson and parke davis staff suggests that the firm s representatives 
 were not averse to fuelling hanson s 0:han 0:son 0:s sense of outrage against collip and eli lilly axel hjort 
 advised hanson in his dealings with lilly suggesting that he present a paper at an upcoming am a meeting in 
 order to let the world know your position 0:posi 0:tion in this matter and perhaps stem the tide of the 
 collip propaganda 0:propa 0:ganda 61 hjort also counselled hanson on how to present himself in his scientific publications he once 
 wired hanson to try to prevent him from submitting a paper for publication he was worried that hanson would injure 
 his own cause by making broad therapeutic claims based on his clinical findings hjort had warned hanson about this sort 
 of thing before he explained that the scientific community regarded the claims of researchers like vines as being the result 
 of irrational enthusiasm 0:enthusi 0:asm and a lack of properly controlled experimentation despite this hanson again and again lapsed into 
 making claims based on anecdotal 
 the parathyroid hormone controversy 1923 1927 515 1 clinical observations perhaps this was because he was too eager to believe 
 0:be 0:lieve that his product had broader application in a hopeful letter hanson 0:han 0:son speculated that the parathyroid hormone 
 might be more important a discovery than insulin even though hanson knew that collip had discovered that the proteolytic enzymes 
 of digestion destroyed the parathyroid 0:para 0:thyroid hormone he continued to prescribe the oral administration of the hydrochloric x as 
 late as 1935 he did so in the belief that his extract contained some useful substance in addition to the 
 hormone years later he continued to report that he found the extract effective against such ills as pulmonary and laryngeal 
 tuberculosis gastric and duodenal ulcers wounds toxemias of pregnancy arthritis cystitis bronchitis encephalitis chorea paralysis agitans asthma pleurisy eczema hemophilia 
 nervousness and even a general feeling of being rundown 61 the priority dispute influenced the development of other aspects of 
 the scientific work that occupied the two researchers collip and hanson 0:han 0:son produced competing methods of biological assay and 
 competing unit sizes for the hormone since lilly and parke davis marketed their products with the unit size chosen by 
 the researcher each of them backed the scientific literature on parathyroid had a confusion of collip units and hanson units 
 for many years the priority dispute 0:dis 0:pute was further complicated by the addition of a third claimant louis berman 
 an endocrinologist and biochemist from the laboratory of biological 0:bi 0:ological chemistry in the school of medicine of columbia university 
 new york berman filed a patent for a parathyroid extract on 1 2 may 1924 his method differed from collip 
 s and hanson s but his early publications did not disclose critical details of his experimental work after collip made 
 his announcement the following year berman responded 0:re 0:sponded by publishing two further reports of his work more detailed than 
 the previous ones he challenged collip s priority in an angry letter 0:let 0:ter to the editor of the journal 
 of the american medical association on 23 july 1927 63 meanwhile hanson had become even more upset he verged on 
 accusing 0:ac 0:cusing collip of plagiarism arguing that his own report in the proceedings 0:proceed 0:ings of the society for 
 experimental biology and medicine of february 1924 had predated collip s first recorded experiment by seven months how valid was 
 hanson s charge all but one of hanson s 1923 and 1924 publications had appeared in the military surgeon the 
 journal for the association of military surgeons of the united states it is unlikely 0:un 0:likely that collip an academic 
 biochemist would have come across them hanson s 1924 abstract in the proceedings however had been clearly entitled experiments with 
 an active extract of parathyroid and had included a description of the method of preparing the extract 
 j b collip 52 as well as a report that it was effective in treating tetany in parathyroidectomized 0:para 0:thyroidectomized 
 dogs collip was certainly familiar with the proceedings 0:proceed 0:ings and in fact after searching the literature in mid 19 
 24 he cited several papers from the journal in his initial publication on the parathyroid 0:para 0:thyroid notably he cited 
 berman s paper on the subject which appeared 0:ap 0:peared in an issue of the proceedings following the one in 
 which hanson s article had appeared 64 the historical record offers no conclusive evidence about when collip first learned about 
 hanson s method written testimonies suggest that it was brought to his attention only in early december 1924 after he 
 had completed his early experiments clowes commented to h m tory president 0:pres 0:ident of the university of alberta that 
 he had wired collip about hanson s 0:han 0:son 0:s work early in december 1924 and subsequently wired and wrote 
 him about being sure to at least insert some foot note regarding hanson in his earliest publications 6s collip added 
 this footnote to his first publication 0:pub 0:lication received by the journal of biological chemistry on 3 december 1924 since 
 the submission of the data herein recorded for publication the papers of dr hanson of fairbault sic minnesota published in 
 the military surgeon have come to the attention of the writer 66 given collip s skill in extracting the hormones 
 of many other glands and given his laboratory style described by colleagues as strangely unorthodox and reminiscent of mrs beaton 
 because he rarely carried out a purification 0:pu 0:rification procedure in exactly the same way 67 it seems entirely possible 
 0:possi 0:ble that collip developed the method of extraction with hot hydrochloric acid quite independently through a process of trial 
 and error over the next few years references to the disputed priority were veiled at least in the scientific literature 
 in private correspondence however hanson was vitriolic he began to believe that his enemy was not collip but organized medicine 
 as a whole or rather the small clique he thought was running the american medical association he felt that this 
 clique readily accepted collip s claim but refused to recognize 0:recog 0:nize his own simply because he was a nobody 
 from a small town he speculated that organized medicine had set up a code of ethics that favoured the career 
 scientist from the world of universities and institutes 0:insti 0:tutes foundations and endowments 68 hanson may have been discounted by 
 many professional scientists not so much because he was an independent researcher but because he was a clinician studying the 
 secretions of the glands during this period 0:pe 0:riod the ama led by morris fishbein the editor of its journal 
 was undertaking a crusade against nostrums and medical quackery one of the chief targets of the campaign was the glandular 
 charlatan the leaders of the new science of endocrinology were troubled that their work was associated with disreputable glandular treatments 
 their 
 the parathyroid hormone controversy 1923 1927 53 problem was compounded by the popularity of organotherapy among practitioners and the public 
 the recently formed association for the study of internal secretions although counting such notable medical scientists as lewellys f barker 
 walter b cannon joseph aub harvey cushing and edward kendall among its early presidents experienced considerable scepticism and even hostility 
 from the medical community 0:commu 0:nity hans lisser former president of the association later recalling the poor attendance at meetings 
 speculated that endocrinology was in such disrepute that it might have been safer and wiser to have met in secret 
 he added conditions were such that any younger clinician not yet firmly established and despite an unblemished reputation who dared 
 to embark on a career in this field was looked upon askance considered naive and gullible or perhaps worse suspected 
 of straying 0:stray 0:ing into the realm of quackery and heading for the endocrine gold fields 69 medical scientists were 
 particularly concerned about the well meaning general practitioner who was apt to be led astray they felt by the bombardment 
 of advertising material in his presidential address 0:ad 0:dress before the association in 1921 harvey cushing urged his fellow members 
 to exercise caution endocrinology as a special subject if it wishes to survive and come to be a factor in 
 medical practice must look out for the character of its clinical advance agents lest it come to be utterly discredited 
 70 in this context of hazy therapeutics collip s 0:col 0:lip 0:s discovery was regarded by the editor of the 
 association s journal as a matter of congratulations since it does contain a something that does something 7l in the 
 midst of his dispute with hanson collip joined the fight against glandular quackery if in a modest way that year 
 1925 collip was elected the president of the association for the study of internal secretions 0:secre 0:tions reporting on his 
 address to the ama the press carried headlines declaring that the young canadian scientist pronounced monkey glands to be buncombe 
 this was a reference to collip s comments on the voronoff glandular treatments as far as can be ascertained this 
 was the one public denouncement of quackery that collip made during his long career he was perhaps eager at this 
 time to distance his own work on the glands from its less scientific counterpart 72 in the scientific literature of 
 the time hanson and collip were sometimes 0:some 0:times given equal credit for the isolation of the parathyroid hormone although 
 collip was acknowledged to have conclusively demonstrated the physiological activity of the hormone through his measurement of the serum calcium 
 when supporters of either collip or hanson referred 0:re 0:ferred to the accomplishment they subtly emphasized the contributions of the 
 man they backed when scientists from outside collip s and hanson s immediate circles used the extract in their research 
 however 
 j b collip 54 they usually cited only collip over the years as the details of the episode 0:epi 0:sode 
 dimmed with time references to hanson s contribution became less frequent 73 the outcome in a sense both hanson and 
 collip might be considered to have won this dispute since two distinct battles were fought with two sets of rules 
 for winning the notions of discovery were construed very differently 0:differ 0:ently in patent law than in science in the 
 outcome of the dispute the two notions became entangled just as biomedical science and commerce 0:com 0:merce themselves became more 
 enmeshed on zi november 1927 hanson s patent application was declared in interference with applications from berman and collip and 
 with one other from a joseph a m0re11 74 berman and hanson were the contenders 0:con 0:tenders with the earliest 
 claims to priority so the applications of collip and morrell were dismissed at the final hearing on 5 march 1931 
 hanson s case was presented by parke davis lawyers and berman s by lilly lawyers berman s attorneys argued that 
 berman had priority in this matter because one of the aspects of the invention was the demonstration 0:demon 0:stration of 
 the physiological action of the extract on the blood serum calcium it was doubtful that hanson knew that his extract 
 had an effect 0:ef 0:fect on the serum calcium before berman s filing date of 12 may 1924 the examiner 
 of interferences ruled however that this was merely an incidental property in awarding priority to hanson the examiner explained 0:ex 
 0:plained that it was not essential to the invention that the inventor should know the reason why the composition accomplishes 
 its purpose or that he should be aware of the particular chemical physical or physiological 0:phys 0:iological properties of the 
 substance which enable it to accomplish that purpose it was only necessary that the invention be put to useful application 
 0:ap 0:plication and indeed hanson had done so prior to berman s filing date by showing that his extract treated 
 tetany it did not matter that he did not have a clear idea that his principle was a hormone nor 
 did it matter that he had been unaware that it acted to raise the serum calcium level 75 the next 
 battle that hanson had to fight was to prove that his claim was patentable patent law required that an application 
 be filed within two years of the first public disclosure of the invention the law examiner 0:exam 0:iner ruled that 
 hanson had revealed his discovery in his first publication 0:publica 0:tion of march 1923 and that his patent application of 
 30 march 1925 was therefore invalid hanson applied to the board of appeals and was in the ironic position of 
 trying to prove that although he had described boiling the glands in dilute hydrochloric acid in this first paper this 
 
 the parathyroid hormone controversy 1923 192 7 55 procedure had been merely part of the test for purine bodies he 
 had not known at that time nor did he have proof that the method was the same as that for 
 the preparation of the parathyroid hormone hanson s appeal was rejected but his attorneys later had several interviews with the 
 examiner and according to them they finally convinced him that he was in error and that a patent should issue 
 76 on 13 december 1932 the u s patent office awarded hanson the patent for the product and process of 
 extracting the principle of the parathyroid gland parke davis eli lilly and later e r squibb produced 0:pro 0:duced the 
 product under his patent for some years hanson finally felt vindicated referring to his dual accomplishments of developing the method 
 of extraction and refining and standardizing the product he penned this colourful analogy it seems that i am about to 
 receive the credit for being the first to reach the north and the south poles of the parathyroid problem as 
 amundsen did with the earth and his dogs others reached them too but he was the first one there he 
 was a crude explorer but he got there and he got there first 77 as a result of his patent 
 win hanson received much attention in the press and several awards from local medical groups the minnesota state medical association 
 presented him with a gold medal in 1933 he was asked to provide an article on the subject of the 
 parathyroid glands to the journal of the american medical association sadly though he became aware that the scientific community continued 
 to associate the name of collip with the parathyroid discovery he was highly sensitive to rumours that others in the 
 medical profession were criticizing him for profiting from a medical discovery as an independent 0:indepen 0:dent researcher he did not 
 have the option available to academic scientists 0:scien 0:tists of donating his patent to his university and having the proceeds 
 channelled back into his research for several years he had looked forward 0:for 0:ward to using his royalties to finance 
 further investigations now despite 0:de 0:spite the fact that he had drawn his family into serious debt because of his 
 devotion to his science he felt compelled to donate his royalties to the smithsonian institution disheartened but still determined hanson 
 continued to run the hanson research laboratory for many years describing himself as patron chief chemist assistant chemist stenographer 0:stenogra 
 0:pher bottle washer and janitor he worked in collaboration with parke davis in attempting to extract the active principles of 
 many other glands including the pineal carotid body parotid glands lymph gland and spleen the most successful of his later 
 ventures was an extract 0:ex 0:tract of the thymus called karkinolysin which he used in the treatment 0:treat 0:ment of 
 cancer and which he found also promoted growth 7b collip can be said to have won the dispute with hanson 
 in another sense as well in today s scientific literature he is the one credited with 
 j b collip 56 preparing an active extract providing conclusive proof of its activity and opening the field for further 
 research his modification of the kramer tisdall method of calcium determination and his development of a biological assay are also 
 noted as important achievements late in his career collip was recognized for the major contributions he had made to the 
 physiology of the field as a special guest at the first symposium devoted entirely to the parathyroids he was lauded 
 as a founder of parathyroid research in 1959 a bronze tablet was erected in the department of biochemistry of the 
 university of alberta in tribute to the international recognition collip had achieved for his isolation of the parathyroid hormone there 
 in 1925 79 paul munson an endocrinologist writing about the priority dispute decades later suggests that collip s work was 
 more readily accepted than hanson s by the scientific community because to some extent the growing profession of endocrinology preferred 
 to acknowledge the contributions of a biochemistry professor with a grand discovery already 0:al 0:ready to his credit over those 
 of a small town practitioner and amateur chemist 80 certainly munson and others are correct in saying that hanson s 
 case was not helped by his having buried his early publications 0:publica 0:tions in military surgeon where those involved in 
 endocrine research were unlikely to discover them furthermore the credibility of hanson s 0:han 0:son 0:s claim may have been 
 damaged by the fact that his first report on the preparation of the extract was accompanied by the description of 
 several clinical cases in which he had used the hydrochloric x to treat a variety of ulcers and infections more 
 significantly however the scientific community s criteria for identifying a discovery could not be met by the simple preparation of 
 an extract the discoverer had to understand 0:un 0:derstand what the extract contained and give scientific proof of its action 
 0:ac 0:tion to the scientific world it was not sufficient to just reach the north and south poles as it 
 were one had to actually realize that one had gotten there and had to be able to prove it moreover 
 as endocrinology 0:endocri 0:nology emerged as an experimental science the proper sort of proof became defined as the production of 
 standard physiological responses rather than as individual clinical results the two pharmaceutical houses that played a part in this dispute 
 were caught between the two notions of discovery for the purposes of patent law and the commercial exploitation of a 
 product the demonstration 0:dem 0:onstration of clinical results was crucial for scientific credibility however the experimental definition was more important 
 the pharmaceutical 0:phar 0:maceutical firms that wanted to establish reputations as scientifically sound manufacturers of hormone products had to work 
 within the rules of the new experimental science of endocrinology using standardized 0:stan 0:dardized physiological indicators helped these firms differentiate 
 
 the parathyroid hormone controversy 1923 1927 57 themselves from the producers of desiccated glandular therapies it also allowed them to 
 manufacture products of greater purity and standardized activity after 1932 eli lilly company agreed to recognize hanson s rights under 
 the contract with parke davis and proceeded to manufacture 0:manufac 0:ture and market the product under the hanson patent lilly 
 abandoned its trade name para thor mone in favour of the parathyroid extract 0:ex 0:tract lilly while squibb marketed it 
 as parathyroid hormone squibb parke davis continued to list the product under the trade name paroidin all three products were 
 described as parathyroid extract hanson regrettably the value of the extract was limited because patients frequently became immune to it 
 after repeated doses because of this the competitors dropped out of the market over the years and lilly eventually became 
 the sole firm to produce the hormone in the united states 81 the laboratory the clinic and the pharmaceutical industry 
 the interactions among the laboratory the clinic and the pharmaceutical 0:pharmaceuti 0:cal industry were important in shaping the development of 
 endocrine research in america in the 19205 they influenced what scientific data was to be considered significant who would be 
 able to collect it how the results were to be expressed and how these results could be commercially 0:com 0:mercially 
 exploited the relations of the three parties continued to intensify 0:in 0:tensify in the succeeding decades to the endocrine scientist 
 of the 19305 the surging popular and scientific 0:sci 0:entific interest in the hormones brought both danger and opportunity leaders 
 in the young field such as collip clearly feared that their work would be dismissed by orthodox medical science because 
 it was too closely associated with the extravagant claims and fraudulent commercial products that often attended organotherapy their key to 
 scientific legitimacy was to firmly entrench the new research program of endocrinology the goal of their research was no longer 
 to extract cures for deficiency diseases but to study hormones as chemical messengers 0:mes 0:sengers that functioned in normal physiology 
 accompanying this research 0:re 0:search program was the new criterion that the presence of a hormone be demonstrated not only 
 by the satisfaction of the requirements of replacement therapy but by the production of standard measurable physiological responses endocrine therapy 
 presented such potential that many general practitioners were drawn to using glandular products 0:prod 0:ucts and to conducting their own 
 investigations the medical scientists 0:scien 0:tists feared that the new science might be mired down by such 
 58 j b collip physicians who although sincere in their desire to help their patients 0:pa 0:tients might be insufficiently 
 critical about glandular therapies by changing the criterion for establishing the presence of a hormone from a clinical to a 
 physiological measure the academic scientists moved the locus of authority from the sickbed to the laboratory by setting a standard 
 for physiological testing that would demand significant 0:signi 0:ficant amounts of time training special equipment and experimental animals they also 
 favoured the scientifically trained institutionally affiliated full time scientist over the independent researcher the leaders in the new field had 
 the opportunity not only to add to the scientific understanding of physiological function but to discover therapies for a whole 
 new range of ailments as in other fields of medical 0:medi 0:cal science endocrine researchers began to work with the 
 science based pharmaceutical industry to bring the results of the laboratory to practical 0:prac 0:tical application collaborative ventures were valuable 
 to academic researchers because they could bring the resources of industrial laboratories 0:labora 0:tories to the task of purifying and 
 standardizing hormone preparations moreover royalties from successful products could mean new funds for research with this new partnership however came 
 new difficulties 0:difficul 0:ties the technicalities of patent law and the demands of commerce reshaped 0:re 0:shaped the manner in 
 which scientific findings were transmitted and the priority for discoveries was established 
 4 rebuilding medicine at mcgill 1928 1933 i am getting more thrilled all the time about the change and i 
 only hope that luck in research will continue to follow me if we can get a research staff together however 
 if luck deserts in one place for a time it may hit in another j b collip to c f 
 martin dean of the faculty of medicine mcgill university 9 december 192 7 1 in 1928 collip accepted a call 
 to succeed a b macallum in the chair of biochemistry at mcgill university collip s appointment was part of an 
 overall plan by mcgill s administrators to rebuild the reputation of its medical school for collip the move to montreal 
 ushered in a period of unprecedented activity his next successful endeavour was one of the first fruits of mcgill s 
 ambitious scheme at mcgill collip turned his attention to the complex and rapidly expanding field of the sex hormones this 
 was a highly competitive arena worldwide one in which theoretical issues and questions of priority 0:pri 0:ority were hotly debated 
 the tension between science and commerce that he had experienced in the parathyroid hormone episode was even more pronounced in 
 this endeavour collip was more than an explorer in the intellectual domain he was also an entrepreneur negotiating the vagaries 
 of commercial collaboration and private patronage the commodity 0:com 0:modity he offered was the scientific knowledge he produced its potential 
 0:po 0:tential therapeutic applications and to some extent the prestige of medical science itself as early as 1924 mcgill had 
 sought collip as a replacement for his mentor a b macallum in the chair of biochemistry sir arthur currie principal 
 of mcgill wrote collip asking if he would consider joining the staff with the understanding that macallum though still full 
 of vigor enthusiasm and usefulness would resign in a few years and collip would then be given charge of the 
 department currie added i believe we are beginning a period of great advancement citing the opening of the new biological 
 laboratories and the pathological 
 60 j b collip institute which he noted is generally regarded as the finest pathological 0:patholog 0:ical building on the 
 continent while the biological laboratories are concidered sic very fine indeed he added that the school hoped to announce the 
 establishment of a university clinic and that in the near future interesting announcements will be made regarding the departments 0:depart 
 0:ments of public health and psychiatry i believe that our medical school has taken on anew sic lease of life 
 and will rapidly regain any prestige which some critics think it has lost collip refused the offer replying that he 
 preferred to remain in alberta for a little time yet to enjoy the research department he had forged while he 
 had the highest respect for macallum he did not relish taking up a teaching post under him and was only 
 willing to go to mcgill if he could be assured a research 0:re 0:search position 2 the call came again 
 in 1927 the dean of medicine c f martin wrote to collip privately in august to again explore collip s 
 interest saying i and most of my colleagues would view with favor indeed with enthusiasm the possibility of your succeeding 
 to the chair during 0:dur 0:ing this same period however collip was in the midst of negotiations with the mayo 
 clinic in rochester minnesota collip had considerable personal connections with the world famous clinic having taken his daughter there to 
 have her tonsils removed and more significantly taken his wife ray there that year for extensive surgery and a lengthy 
 stay the clinic had founded the concept of cooperative private group practice and its work was undergoing rapid expansion during 
 this period 0:pe 0:riod having grown beyond surgical work to encompass general medicine 0:medi 0:cine and laboratory research in 19 
 15 the mayo clinic had established a graduate medical school at the university of minnesota on 11 august 0:au 0:gust 
 1927 the clinic s board of governors voted unanimously to offer collip a position on the staff as professor of 
 biochemistry in conjunction 0:conjunc 0:tion with the university of minnesota the offer had excellent terms a proposed salary of 10 
 000 a year with a bonus of 5 000 for moving expenses an assistant at 3 500 a year a 
 laboratory technician a laboratory 0:labo 0:ratory specially arranged for him and the understanding that collip was to be an independent 
 investigator and could run his own laboratory 0:labora 0:tory leonard rowntree who incidentally was a collaborator of adolph hanson s 
 on the parathyroid hormone work wrote that he and the staff were all greatly interested in collip s coming because 
 his field of investigation was very promising especially with respect to clinical applications he assured collip that while he would 
 be independent 0:inde 0:pendent mayo researchers were looking forward to working with him as a team as well at the 
 last minute however collip turned the offer down although he had already arranged for a house and car in minnesota 
 0:min 0:nesota he changed his mind having come to believe that despite official 0:offi 
 rebuilding medicine at mcgill 19z8 1933 61 cial statements to the contrary he would be expected to work on whatever 
 he was told that possibility was unacceptable to him 3 collip decided instead to take up the post at mcgill 
 he tendered his resignation at alberta on 30 august 1927 expressing his deep regret to president tory and adding that 
 he was not leaving through any feeling of dissatisfaction for it is hard to conceive of any place where more 
 kindly consideration could have been afforded one he noted to martin 0:mar 0:tin at mcgill that his considerable travelling expenses 
 subscriptions to journals and society dues had all been met at alberta in fact they have been so good to 
 me here that it seems an imposition to leave in this respect i must say that dr tory has been 
 perfectly splendid and put not the least obstacle in my path the position at mcgill offered a salary of 7 
 000 and was to begin 1 june 1928 currie wrote i personally 0:per 0:sonally am very gratified that the hopes 
 we have had in mind for the last few years have at last been fulfilled 4 a b macallum had 
 apparently been delaying retirement for some time he had encountered difficulties in arranging for a pension because 0:be 0:cause he 
 had been at mcgill only since 1920 as well there had been some difficulty in finding a suitable successor macallum 
 had approached 0:ap 0:proached i m rabinowitch pathological chemist at the montreal general hospital and a pioneer in canadian clinical 
 chemistry but rabinowitch had declined the offer the position of number 2 in the department then went to sidney bliss 
 of harvard but this did not work out well according to rabinowitch s recollection many years later with collip s 
 appointment bliss agreed to remain in the department as long as he could be assured time for research he continued 
 there for several years once collip agreed to take the job macallum felt satisfied 0:satis 0:fied that a fine successor 
 had at last been found he told collip he was very desirous of being free of the load he had 
 carried for years and was looking forward to having time for his own research this he intended to carry on 
 to the very end 5 collip looked forward to taking up his new post with keen anticipation 0:anticipa 0:tion only 
 after his appointment was made final did collip reveal to martin that he would be bringing with him a considerable 
 research fund he explained that he had kept silent on the matter because he had not wanted to unduly influence 
 the decision of the mcgill administration 0:adminis 0:tration collip s insulin royalties went with him to mcgill and in 1927 
 they amounted to 13 648 this sum was 2 500 more than the royalties 0:royal 0:ties from the previous year 
 collip noted that if it keeps on increasing at this rate research should not suffer from want of money 6 
 collip also brought along with him arthur long his right hand man since 191 5 except during the latter s 
 war service overseas although 0:al 0:though long owned his own home in edmonton and according to 
 62 j b collip collip had been supremely happy with his life there he agreed to follow collip to mcgill 
 as his personal assistant out of sheer loyalty at mcgill he would play an important role looking after collip and 
 facilitating 0:fa 0:cilitating the success of his laboratory group 7 collip s appointment as chair of mcgill s department of 
 biochemistry 0:biochemis 0:try was part of a larger plan by mcgill administrators to rebuild the prestige of the medical school 
 on the foundation of scientific medicine mcgill s medical faculty was known for the work of sir william osier the 
 great clinician and teacher but since his departure at the end of the previous century it had lost ground to 
 the university of toronto because 0:be 0:cause of toronto s greater strength in the basic sciences toronto medicine 0:medi 0:cine 
 had close ties to biology and was influenced by the strong research program that had developed at the university in 
 contrast medicine at mcgill rested on its strong clinical tradition furthermore the instructors 0:instruc 0:tors in natural history botany and 
 zoology did not develop as strong a research oriented approach to their subject as their counterparts 0:counter 0:parts at toronto 
 8 the main elements of mcgill s ambitious plan to strengthen scientific medicine in the 1920s and 1930s were the 
 construction 0:con 0:struction of modern laboratory facilities and the appointment of highly promising scientific researchers beginning in the 19205 the 
 rockefeller foundation made a series of grants to mcgill as it did to the universities of toronto dalhousie montreal manitoba 
 and alberta marianne stevens describes how these grants had the effect of catalyzing and reinforcing the reform of canadian medical 
 education around the science based model mcgill unlike the university of toronto received almost no financial aid from the provincial 
 government and instead had had to rely primarily on student fees and private support from montreal s anglophone elite 9 
 the grants from the rockefeller foundation had a dramatic impact at mcgill not only because of the value of the 
 grants themselves but also because the gifts were made contingent upon the university obtaining additional funds from other sources the 
 foundation made significant contributions to mcgill s expansion 0:expan 0:sion over the next two decades grants included a general endowment 
 of 1 million to the faculty of medicine in 19 21 for the erection of new buildings for physiology pathology 
 and psychiatry an endowment 0:endow 0:ment of 500 000 in 1924 for a university medical clinic 85 000 for research 
 and experimental surgery in 1929 and 1 232 652 in 1932 for development of teaching and research in neurology this 
 funding made possible the construction of the biological building in 1922 the pathological building in 1924 25 the department of 
 medicine the university medical clinic and most notably the neurological institute 0:insti 0:tute which would showcase the talents of the 
 renowned neurologist 
 rebuilding medicine at mcgill 1928 193 3 63 and neurosurgeon wilder penfield penfield had been lured to mcgill in 1927 
 with the promise of new research and clinical facilities for his work the institute built in 1932 brought international attention 
 and prestige to mcgill 10 the construction of the new biological building in 1922 was an important 0:im 0:portant first 
 step in rebuilding medicine at mcgill on the foundation of experimental research set on the site of the old medical 
 building which had been destroyed by fire in 1907 the new five storey building was constructed with modern laboratory facilities 
 when the building was opened four internationally known scientists gave inaugural addresses harvey cushing mosely professor of surgery at harvard 
 sir charles sherrington regius professor of physiology at oxford h j hamburger professor of physiology from the university of groningen 
 and john m coulter professor of botany at the university of chicago in his speech harvey cushing remarked that with 
 the completion of the new laboratory 0:labora 0:tory the last word in laboratories had been said and its creation marked 
 the beginning of the laboratory era in the teaching of medicine it is true that similar things are going on 
 in other medical schools but here at mcgill at least this was the beginning of the laboratory movement 0:move 0:ment 
 whereby the anatomical dissecting room for generations the only place where observation was called for and the special senses were 
 trained had come to be largely supplanted 11 at the helm of this ambitious rebuilding plan was charles f martin 
 the dean of medicine and renowned as a genius for organization wilder penfield remembered him as a small quick moving 
 man who was not at all impressive at first not until you talked with him and discovered the keen mind 
 the quick perceptions the unyielding strength and the human kindness always served up with a quip or a laugh he 
 was professor of medicine and a physician at the royal victoria 0:vic 0:toria hospital in 1906 and became dean of 
 medicine in 1922 his colleague 0:col 0:league d sclater lewis recalled that by 1930 martin s reorganization of the faculty 
 was almost complete in addition to the appointment of collip in biochemistry and of wilder penfield and his associate william 
 cone in neurology and neurosurgery martin had also been responsible 0:responsi 0:ble for bringing in such renowned medical scientists and 
 teachers as boris babkin as research professor of physiology in 1928 r l stehle as head of the department of 
 pharmacology and jonathan meakins as the first full time professor of medicine and director of the new university 0:univer 0:sity 
 medical clinic at the royal victoria hospital in 1924 according to lewis meakins breathed new life into the research work 
 of the clinic lewis recalled that martin s success as an organiser at mcgill had depended on two factors first 
 he was a good judge of men and second he had been able to obtain the funds to attract them 
 to the 
 64 j b collip university as a result of his efforts mcgill grew less dependent on the osier tradition and 
 became a first class medical school in its own right 12 a strong supporter of martin s in his work 
 was megilps president sir arthur currie the military hero who had commanded the canadian corps in the last years of 
 the first world war with great success at the end of the war he was offered the presidency of mcgill 
 university although 0:al 0:though not an academic he took an active role in the running of the university from eating 
 with with fraternity men and attending sporting events to personally interviewing all candidates for appointments in a period before there 
 were vice principals assistants to the principal or public relations officers his secretary recalls that the principal himself really did 
 administer in his hands were the reins guiding the whole team currie was one of the country s leading figures 
 in the postwar years and his influence and fame proved invaluable to the university s nationwide campaign to raise money 
 to refurbish the facilities that had fallen into neglect during the war by 1930 however the great depression 0:depres 0:sion 
 was beginning to take its toll on the university and currie and the board of governors had to struggle even 
 to maintain its programs nevertheless currie actively promoted the expansion of the faculty of medicine most notably by personally supporting 
 its bid to win the rockefeller gift to build the neurological institute in 1932 he did not originate or guide 
 specific plans but many at the medical school appreciated 0:appre 0:ciated his contributions of energy and enthusiasm 13 by the 
 end of 1928 martin was able to report that his plans for the medical faculty were going well and that 
 his new staff was settling in happily as acting principle during curries absence martin wrote currie 0:cur 0:rie that everything 
 in the biol bldg is booming is most encouraging 0:encourag 0:ing collip his staff babkin stehle etc all enthusiastic happy 
 babkin was lecturing to enthusiastic groups of students and penfield was captivating everybody and his surgical work on the nervous 
 system is simply marvellous martin was only concerned that penfield was working so hard that he is going to rapidly 
 kill himself if he doesn t cut down in some way or other he added cryptically that collip and babkin 
 are measuring up well as we expected but the former is certainly temperamental and needs occasionally the benefit of a 
 child guidance clinic 14 is this perhaps an indication that collip s tendency to selfpromotion 0:self 0:promotion was incurring some 
 ire at mcgill as it had at alberta collip s research work flourished in this new environment during the period 
 of transition from edmonton to montreal he had produced a small number of papers on a variety of topics none 
 of which had developed 0:de 0:veloped into anything of particular promise but now he forged into the rapidly expanding field 
 of the sex hormones 
 rebuilding medicine at mcgill 1928 1933 65 one of the keys to collip s success at mcgill was the appointment 
 of david landsborough thomson to his staff in 1928 thomson was british 0:brit 0:ish trained and the son of sir 
 landsborough thomson who served under 0:un 0:der various titles as the second secretary of the british medical research council from 
 1919 to 1957 david thomson had studied geology and zoology at aberdeen university he had then been a research student 
 at gonville and caius college cambridge under sir frederick gowland hopkins in the sir william dunn institute of biochemistry until 
 he received 0:re 0:ceived his phd in biochemistry in 1928 during these years he had also worked at the marine 
 biological laboratories at millport plymouth and roscoff in brittany as well as at the university of grenoble and in zurich 
 he was invited to join collip s department as lecturer in 1928 and was promoted to assistant professor the following 
 year thomson an articulate and gifted teacher took over all the teaching in the biochemistry department and thus freed collip 
 at best a reluctant 0:reluc 0:tant lecturer to concentrate on the work that he most loved and was best suited 
 for his research thomson was highly literate and possessed 0:pos 0:sessed both a photographic memory and an encyclopaedic knowledge of 
 the scientific literature while he was not very active in the laboratory 0:labora 0:tory himself he performed the important function 
 of keeping collip and his staff apprised of the latest developments in other investigations collip called thomson a true scholar 
 who commands a wider knowledge 0:knowl 0:edge of the world literature on biological subjects than anyone else that iknow 1 
 during collip s last years at the university of alberta he had continued 0:contin 0:ued to write and conduct research 
 on the parathyroid hormone contributing 0:con 0:tributing to the elucidation of its physiological function this work continued to occupy his 
 interest for many years even after the move to mcgill as collip remarked of this line of research i must 
 not forget that this is my baby and i will be expected to nurse it for some time to come 
 in 1928 he announced the preparation of a substance that produced 0:pro 0:duced a rise in blood pressure for an 
 unusually long duration he was able to extract this substance from a variety of tissues including muscle 0:mus 0:cle liver 
 ovary and testis using heat to pull out the principle as he had with the parathyroid hormone he was unable 
 to obtain the substance 0:sub 0:stance in a crystalline state and could not conclude whether it truly existed 0:ex 0:isted 
 or whether it was an artefact of his extraction procedure this line of work proved unfruitful and he published nothing 
 further on it 16 the hormones of the placenta in 1930 collip s luck hit again this time in the 
 hormones of the placenta his placental extracts brought attention to himself and to 
 66 j b collip mcgill and with it controversy this development had several dimensions 0:dimen 0:sions first collip was engaged 
 in a theoretical debate about the nature and function of the active principles that he extracted from the placenta 0:pla 
 0:centa this debate illustrates the theoretical and methodological issues that engaged sex hormone researchers of this period second collip once 
 again found himself in the midst of an ethical debate concerning the commercial use of the results of medical science 
 third collip was engaged in a struggle to fund his expanding research enterprise the need for private gifts forced him 
 and mcgill officials into the troublesome 0:trouble 0:some business of dealing with wealthy benefactors and their potentially difficult personalities as 
 in the parathyroid episode the question of priority in discovery was hotly debated but this time in relation not only 
 to the prestige of the investigators themselves but also to that of their patrons and institutions collip used the knowledge 
 produced in the laboratory as leverage in his negotiations with his institution and financial 0:fi 0:nancial backers to preserve and 
 expand his domain to the academic institutions and private patrons medical research became an investment 0:invest 0:ment opportunity capable of 
 transforming money into public recognition 0:recogni 0:tion and praise in september 19z9 bertold p wiesner of the university of edinburgh 
 visited collip at his laboratory and told him about his ongoing research wiesner a lecturer in animal genetics was performing 
 a long series of experiments 0:ex 0:periments to examine the physiological factors relating to maternal behaviour 0:be 0:haviour in the 
 rat in this work he had prepared extracts of the placenta with sulphosalicylic acid he had come to believe that 
 the placenta had two hormones the first which he called rho 1 had the effect of causing 0:caus 0:ing estrus 
 and bringing immature female rats to premature puberty the second rho 11 caused luteinization and pseudo pregnancy wiesner had demonstrated 
 in what collip called a single but convincing experiment 0:experi 0:ment that the sulphosalicylic acid extract of fresh human placenta 
 was effective in producing premature maturity in the young rat according to collip it was at wiesner s very urgent 
 request that he took up the problem of concentrating and purifying the first of these two extracts rho 1 and 
 made it a subject of special study in his laboratory later collip took up work on rho 11 as well 
 17 the two placental hormones that collip was to isolate would bring him very different types of recognition the hormone 
 that caused estrus that is the one that had an estrogenic function was found to have great clinical value and 
 was developed into a commercially important therapeutic substance the hormone that stimulated the ovary to form corpora lutea that is 
 the one that had a gonadotrophic effect had theoretical importance collip identified it as distinct from the biologically 0:biologi 0:cally 
 similar substance discovered in the anterior pituitary 18 
 rebuilding medicine at mcgill 19x8 1933 67 the sex hormones had become the focus of intense study during the 19205 
 it was known that in the female reproductive cycle an egg is nurtured in a follicle in the ovary the 
 follicle then matures and releases the egg in ovulation then the remaining follicle tissue is transformed into the corpus luteum 
 which has an endocrine function of supporting pregnancy edgar allen and edward doisy at st louis university identified 0:iden 0:tified 
 the ovarian hormone estrin in 1923 24 the hormone was isolated in the maturing follicles and found to have the 
 effect of causing estrus in the female animal the onset of estrus could be identified by a number of physical 
 changes the opening of the vagina the enlargement 0:enlarge 0:ment of the uterus and changes in the shape of the 
 cells lining the vagina from a columnar type to a scale like type a process known as cornification over the 
 next ten years many investigators isolated various 0:vari 0:ous forms of the estrus causing substances these researchers included adolf butenandt 
 of gottingen in 1929 ernst laqueur of amsterdam in 1930 and guy marrian of the university college london in 1930 
 the substances were known by a variety of names estrin folliculin oestrone theelin menformon thelykinin and pregynon 19 studies of 
 the anterior pituitary a tiny gland located at the base of the brain indicated that this gland served as the 
 conductor of the endocrine orchestra it regulated the action of many other endocrine glands including the thyroid the adrenal cortex 
 and the gonads the anterior pituitary acted on the ovaries and testes by secreting gonadstimulating 0:gonad 0:stimulating or gonadotrophic hormones 
 in 1926 bernhard zondek of the university of berlin and selmar aschheim of the municipal hospital 0:hos 0:pital of berlin 
 spandau showed that an extract of the anterior pituitary could stimulate the ovaries of immature mice to take on the 
 appearance of puberty that is follicles in the ovary ripened ovulation occurred corpora lutea formed and the hormone estrin was 
 secreted from the ovary they and other investigators discovered that this or perhaps these gonadotrophic principles were also present in 
 other tissues and fluids such as the decidua placenta and the blood and urine of humans 0:hu 0:mans and other 
 animals in the early stages of pregnancy this finding allowed aschheim and zondek to develop a test for pregnancy in 
 1928 one could test for the presence of gonadotrophic factors in the urine which indicates pregnancy by injecting a urine 
 sample into immature mice and looking for signs of early maturity in them in order to succeed in this new 
 field of research collip and his associates 0:asso 0:ciates had to broaden their approach to endocrinology in studying the hormone 
 of the parathyroid gland and some of the other substances he had examined collip was able as with insulin to 
 ascertain the efficacy 0:effi 0:cacy of his extracts by observing standard physiological and biochemical 0:biochemi 0:cal responses in his principal 
 projects he had been able to perform 
 j b collip 68 assays by using chemical tests of bodily fluids in the case of insulin the effect of 
 the hormone could be determined by measuring the drop in blood glucose level while in the case of the parathyroid 
 hormone its effect could be determined by measuring the rise in blood calcium the hormones relating to growth and reproduction 
 were more difficult to detect their effects were only observed in the slow changes in the shape and size of 
 tissues and cells as historian merriley borell argues the real pioneers of reproductive physiology were not the physiologists 0:physiolo 0:gists 
 or the chemists but the histologists who painstakingly determined the gradual changes associated with both sexual differentiation and the estrus 
 cycle 20 the best test for the onset of estrus required that the experimental animal be killed and the ovaries 
 uterus and vagina be sectioned and examined under the microscope for changes in shape and size of cells and tissues 
 and for the presence of follicles and corpora lutea in the ovaries another test the vaginal smear could give a 
 good indication of the onset of estrus without the sacrifice of the test animal in this test a probe was 
 inserted into the vagina to scrape the epithelial cells lining the walls the onset of estrus could be determined by 
 examining the cells under the microscope and observing whether they had taken on the characteristic cornified shape collip began his 
 studies by using wiesner s extraction method treating 0:treat 0:ing fresh human placentas with sulphosalicylic acid he found that it 
 was difficult to remove the residual sulphosalicylic acid and to purify the extract further wiesner had told collip that he 
 had had no success in making extracts with alcohol or acetone but collip attempted preliminary 0:pre 0:liminary trials with these 
 solvents he discovered that extracts made with either acetone or faintly acidulated alcohol were invariably potent because of this he 
 decided to abandon wiesner s method and instead develop an extract based on the use of acetone or alcohol the 
 yield he obtained was very small in the range of one milligram of extract per kilogram of original placenta 21 
 an important breakthrough in the work came about through serendipity 0:seren 0:dipity control immature animals were placed in the same 
 cages as the test immature animals injected with extract collip noted that certain of the control animals were inexplicably undergoing 
 estrus along with the test animals since some fluid almost always leaked from the site of the injection and since 
 the rats were given to licking each other s coats he speculated that the hormone could perhaps be administered by 
 mouth he mixed the extract with lean ground meat and fed it to the rats indeed the rats came into 
 estrus prematurely this chance observation 0:obser 0:vation and quick thinking pointed the way to an important characteristic 0:characteris 0:tic of 
 this new principle that it was orally active a property that was 
 rebuilding medicine at mcgill 1928 193 3 696 9 highly desirable in something that would be used for medical therapy 
 this discovery was particularly gratifying to collip because of his many failed attempts to use insulin and parathyroid hormone orally 
 22 by february 1930 collip felt sufficient confidence in his results that he published a series of preliminary papers in 
 the canadian medical association journal and placed a short note in nature he announced that he had found that extracts 
 of the placenta caused immature rats and mice to mature early and that the extracts were orally active he also 
 reported on the clinical trials he had conducted in collaboration with a d campbell at the royal victoria and montreal 
 general hospitals 0:hospi 0:tals campbell was in the department of gynaecology and obstetrics at mcgill collip and campbell tested the 
 preparation on patients with delayed puberty dysmenorrhea amenorrhea metropathia hemorrhagica 0:hemorrhag 0:ica menopause toxemia of pregnancy certain neurological and psychiatric 
 0:psy 0:chiatric cases and thyroid dysfunction they reported definite and encouraging results 23 to supply this research program placentas were 
 collected from maternity 0:ma 0:ternity wards at the sisters of the misericordia hospital and the royal victoria maternity hospital in 
 192 6 the royal victoria hospital had amalgamated with the montreal maternity hospital creating a splendid 0:splen 0:did new women 
 s hospital with 213 beds 100 cribs and state of theart 0:state 0:of 0:the 0:art facilities 24 collip s associate 
 in this work walter w chipman in 1929 was just retiring as professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at mcgill and 
 as director of the women s pavilion at the royal vie in his retirement chipman continued to serve on the 
 boards of the university and the hospital and for many years visited the hospital almost daily collip relied on colleagues 
 in gynaecology such as chipman in addition 0:addi 0:tion to being his collaborators on clinical trials they supplied him with 
 the raw materials for research research in the sex hormones required steady and abundant supplies of such things as human 
 placentas pregnancy 0:preg 0:nancy urine and other materials associated with human reproduction gynaecological clinics were a rich source nelly oudshoorn 
 argues that since laboratory researchers had to depend on gynaecologists to gain access to these supplies the research questions they 
 chose reflected the practical interests of their clinician partners this created a strong orientation 0:ori 0:entation towards problems of human 
 female reproductive disorders collip s interest in the clinical use of the hormone in these sorts of ailments 0:ail 0:ments 
 reflects the clinicians considerations outlined by oudshoorn as well as his own long standing interest in finding practical therapeutic applications 
 for his extracts 25 the discovery had consequences beyond the laboratory for the mcgill administrators collip s achievement was a 
 testimony to their efforts at rebuilding the good name of mcgill s medical school martin 
 j b collip 70 and currie were actively involved in presenting the extract to the public 0:pub 0:lic and in 
 negotiating its development with commercial firms in addition 0:addi 0:tion to the prestige such a product could bring to the 
 university it also held out the promise of financial rewards both from the royalties generated 0:gen 0:erated by the sales 
 of the product and from benefactors who might be inspired by the success of the work to contribute to mcgill 
 because mcgill was privately funded and because the depression was beginning 0:begin 0:ning to have an affect on the finances 
 of the university the matter of promoting the extract was pressing to the warrior currie scientific discovery was analogous to 
 a contest in which many could play but only one could win to the scientific men martin and collip discovery 
 was only the small final step in a larger enterprise to which many workers had freely made contributions over many 
 years this notion of scientific work was to come into conflict with the goal of developing a product for commercial 
 manufacture the university issued a press release on 12 february announcing that a remarkable discovery had been made everyone at 
 mcgill university 0:uni 0:versity rejoices exceedingly that complete success has rewarded the long and patient efforts of professor collip and 
 his capable assistants in the bio chemistry laboratories of our medical school the substance was characterized as a remedial agent 
 for certain feminine disorders while the investigators were reticent about pronouncing on the full value of the new product they 
 reported that the few clinical tests done so far had shown remarkable results and posited that the field of usefulness 
 0:use 0:fulness for this drug can hardly be over estimated perhaps because collip was particularly wary after his experience with 
 hanson the press release noted that the discovery had been based upon wiesner s work martin wrote it seems to 
 be a genuinely good thing and while we are a little bit reserved as to the ultimate benefits it certainly 
 looks as though it was a great opportunity for further investigation in therapeutics 26 others in the field took notice 
 fuller albright the harvard endocrinologist 0:endocri 0:nologist wrote to congratulate collip on his discovery albright had become interested in the 
 problem the previous summer when he had spent a few days with zondek and aschheim in berlin and with wiesner 
 during an atlantic crossing albright offered either to send an associate or to come himself to montreal to spend some 
 time learning about collip s method members of the public responded as well patients 0:pa 0:tients wrote to mcgill asking 
 for the new medicine only to be told that it was not yet ready for distribution 27 during the winter 
 and spring of 1930 collip continued with his attempts 0:at 0:tempts to isolate and identify his preparation in his initial 
 publications 0:publica 0:tions he argued that his extract was distinct from the previously 
 rebuilding medicine at mcgill 1928 193 3 717 1 identified hormone estrin that was known to be found in the 
 placenta estrin was characterized by its ability to produce estrus in a castrated female rat it was known to occur 
 in the ovary placenta amniotic fluid and the urine of pregnancy since one of the properties of estrin was that 
 it was soluble in ether collip subjected his fraction to several washes with ether to remove all the estrin at 
 first collip toyed with the hypothesis that his product was the same as the ovary stimulating principle that other investigators 
 had isolated from the anterior pituitary but he increasingly became convinced 0:con 0:vinced otherwise one of the key characteristics distinguishing 
 estrin from the anterior pituitary principle was estrin s effectiveness in both normal and castrated animals in contrast the anterior 
 pituitary hormone 0:hor 0:mone was only effective in animals with ovaries that is the anterior pituitary 0:pi 0:tuitary hormone caused 
 the phenomena of estrus through stimulating the action of the ovaries causing them to grow in size and release estrin 
 0:es 0:trin collip s extract was like the anterior pituitary hormone in that it was ineffective in the castrated animal 
 but collip suspected a difference 0:differ 0:ence between them in that unlike the pituitary hormone his was orally active and 
 could survive treatment with the digestive enzymes working on the assumption that the placental and pituitary fractions were not the 
 same he tried to develop a technique to assay the presence of one or the other principles in the blood 
 as a means of determining its properties 0:prop 0:erties as was typical collip used immense quantities of raw material to 
 create his extracts in march collip reported to henry dale that he had made all the extract up to that 
 point by himself and had used something like a ton and a half of human material 18 by april collip 
 s clinical work was proceeding well but he was concerned that he had been giving too much attention to it 
 at the expense of his work on the chemistry of the extract in a paper submitted 0:sub 0:mitted to the 
 canadian medical association journal he provided the first detailed description of his method of preparing the extract in the same 
 paper he also proposed the name emmenin for the product 0:prod 0:uct a name suggested by a b macallum in 
 reference to its property of promoting menstruation that is acting as an emmenogogue collip 0:col 0:lip reported that he had 
 encountered some difficulties with his biological 0:biolog 0:ical assay he complained to martin that the rat test has pretty well 
 blown up due to some seasonal or other factor rats as young as four weeks began to show spontaneous estrus 
 and collip found that he had to use much younger ones for testing in the meantime he decided 0:de 0:cided 
 to appraise the strength of the extracts for clinical use by measuring 0:mea 0:suring the grams of original placenta per 
 cubic centimetre of extract since he trusted the reliability of his methods of processing over the more variable rat test 
 z9 
 j b collip 72 pregnant with trouble science commerce and philanthropy by early february collip and the mcgill administrators began 
 conferring 0:confer 0:ring with a number of pharmaceutical companies to arrange for the manufacture of the placental hormone the first 
 they contacted was not surprisingly eli lilly company lilly s president indicated that he considered this discovery very promising and 
 was interested in cooperating 0:co 0:operating with mcgill in its development an agreement was made with lilly for the exclusive 
 rights to manufacture and distribute the product on the american market the head of a leading montreal firm charles e 
 frosst company also called upon mcgill s principal hoping to persuade him to allow his company to manufacture the preparation 
 0:prep 0:aration the mcgill group negotiated with burroughs wellcome about the manufacture of the product in britain the pharmaceutical company 
 0:com 0:pany that contributed most to the development of collip s extract however was the small montreal firm ayerst mckenna 
 8c harrison ayerst was eventually the only firm to invest heavily in the development 0:develop 0:ment of the product and 
 to manufacture it successfully a preliminary application was made for a canadian patent with the plan that the rights would 
 be turned over to mcgill just as had been the case with insulin at toronto the mcgill group authorized ayerst 
 to manufacture 0:manufac 0:ture the extract in canada for distribution throughout the british empire 0:em 0:pire exclusive of great britain 
 and ireland later the agreement with lilly and the negotiations with burroughs wellcome failed because according 0:ac 0:cording to mcgill 
 officials the firms were unable or perhaps unwilling 0:unwill 0:ing to put the product on the market at a reasonable 
 price when this happened ayerst picked up the rights to distribute in the united states and britain 30 ayerst mckenna 
 c harrison was a young firm incorporated in 1924 it had commenced business early in 1925 the company s founders 
 w a s ayerst w j mckenna william harrison and hugh mcpherson had gained years of experience in the pharmaceutical 
 manufacturing 0:man 0:ufacturing field working at charles frosst the new company distinguished 0:distin 0:guished itself by its strong commitment to 
 research one of its earliest undertakings was to set up the first commercial biological laboratory in canada and the first 
 work of this laboratory was to test and standardize 0:standard 0:ize cod liver oil four years later ayerst produced the 
 first concentrated cod liver oil as a result of its research work a portion of the initial profits from this 
 product was set aside for research and development 3l ayerst invested heavily in the development of emmenin the firm expanded 
 0:ex 0:panded its laboratory work its staff and its animal colony and also added a control laboratory for the new 
 chemical assays on estrogens 
 rebuilding medicine at mcgill 1928 1933 73 as j c simpson martin s successor as dean said later the firm 
 did the spade work to develop emmenin and establish a market for it the extent to which the company was 
 involved in the research and development 0:develop 0:ment of the product is indicated in the memoirs of magnus pyke the 
 chemist perhaps best known as a television personality later in life pyke then a student at mcgill s macdonald college 
 worked in the small research laboratory at ayerst mckenna harrison during the summer of 1932 working closely with collip on 
 several aspects of the development of emmenin most memorable to pyke was his work in determining the biological activity of 
 samples of emmenin this required 0:re 0:quired that he inject the extract into immature female mice and perform 0:per 0:form 
 vaginal smears on them rubbing cells off their vaginas with the tip of a probe every day and examining the 
 cells under a microscope he recalled my duties were bizarre to say the least i must have taken smears from 
 thousands of mice during the course of that summer and brought hundreds to a state of precocious sexual maturity he 
 remembered 0:re 0:membered assisting in the preparation of the extract made in various ways thought up by professor collip and 
 purified by more and more elaborate procedures also strongly impressed in his memory was the image of the gruesome specimens 
 of placentas arriving from the maternity 0:ma 0:ternity hospital in milk churns 3i in the midst of these developments collip 
 came up against private philanthropist thomas bassett macaulay a prominent member of the montreal business community robertson macaulay and his 
 son thomas 0:tho 0:mas bassett were the enterprising father and son duo who managed the sun life assurance company of 
 montreal for sixty years the father robertson was described as a true highland scot in temperament a balanced mixture of 
 the practical and the visionary he had been born in aberdeenshire and had come to canada to seek his fortune 
 at the age of twenty one 33 the macaulays known for their aggressive risk taking style of business helped to 
 make sun life the largest life insurance company 0:com 0:pany in canada with markets in many parts of the world 
 during the period after the first world war sun life like other life insurance companies 0:com 0:panies began to view 
 an improvement of public health as being in the interests 0:in 0:terests of both the insurer and the insured the 
 firm thus began to make contributions to medical care and research during the 1927 typhoid epidemic 0:ep 0:idemic in montreal 
 sun life set up free clinics that allowed some fifty thousand people to receive inoculations 34 t b macaulay took 
 over the management of the firm from his father in 1906 and led it to even greater success while he 
 had been born and raised in canada the younger macaulay had apparently maintained an interest in the welfare of scotland 
 on his model experimental farm in hudson heights quebec he worked on projects to improve wastelands 
 j b collip 74 of the scottish islands and highlands after the stock market crash in 1929 however macaulay and 
 sun life faced the financial repercussions of macaulay s daring investment practices during this troubled time collip and the mcgill 
 group came up against this finance czar macaulay had generously endowed the animal breeding research department of the university of 
 edinburgh supporting the work of wiesner and his associate f a e crew macaulay himself had been responsible 0:re 0:sponsible 
 for introducing wiesner to collip when wiesner had visited montreal subsequently macaulay was appalled when it began to look as 
 though the mcgill scientists were about to gain all the glory for the work initiated by wiesner and crew 3s 
 president currie wrote to c f martin concerned that macaulay s attitude 0:at 0:titude to collip s success was rather 
 pregnant with trouble in curries 0:cur 0:ries opinion macaulay simply did not understand or perhaps was unwilling to accept how 
 credit was accorded in the scientific world there is no doubt that collip and collip alone cut the gordian knot 
 in most of these scientific successes there is one man who finds the last difficult solution 0:solu 0:tion there are 
 many who make contributions but it usually remains for one to make the startling discovery in this field in which 
 collip has been successful the same story prevails japanese and french and germans and others have worked on the problem 
 no doubt the edinburgh authorities carried it on but it was collip who brought it to its final startling successful 
 end 36 even macaulay s private physician was enlisted to visit collip and tell him that there was some indication 
 that the edinburgh group had taken a critical and threatening attitude to the developments at mcgill he also told collip 
 that macaulay was of the opinion that mcgill should share its profits with edinburgh when currie heard of this he 
 brusquely told collip that he was to do nothing of the sort macaulay then approached 0:ap 0:proached currie himself and 
 voiced his objections to the profits he thought mcgill was now set to make he even intimated that perhaps the 
 university s fund raising campaign was unnecessary now that it could use emmenin profits to build its gymnasiums and student 
 residences 37 currie dismissed these protests satisfied that collip had given wiesner and crew every possible credit he speculated that 
 all this trouble had arisen because the edinburgh scientists had tried to flatter their benefactor he had heard that crew 
 had written to macaulay telling 0:tell 0:ing him that collip s success was the first tangible result of macaulay s 
 endowment to edinburgh macaulay had admitted to currie that he had been much criticized for making his gift to edinburgh 
 rather than mcgill and currie charged his vanity has been wounded because he put his money on the wrong horse 
 when he backed edinburgh although 0:al 
 rebuilding medicine at mcgill 1928 1933 75 though he backed a good horse currie even reported that macaulay had told 
 him that he felt he had more to do with emmenin than collip did since his money had made wiesner 
 s work possible in the first place and it had been he who had then introduced wiesner to collip currie 
 complained to martin i don t know what is the matter with mr macaulay and yet i do though perhaps 
 0:per 0:haps you attended the sun life banquet which marked his fifty years association 0:associa 0:tion with the company only 
 yesterday jack cook mentioned it when we were chatting and said he was never more disgusted than he was with 
 the way the old man lapped up the flattery that was heaped upon him that night edinburgh 0:edin 0:burgh and 
 all credit to them have made him feel that he is one of the world s great inspirations to scientific 
 work and he is willing to pay for it i know he is going to be pounced upon by the 
 other governors of the university and made to give quite as much 3b as a way of placating macaulay currie 
 made him a governor of mcgill and gave him an honorary lld in 1930 that same year he was also 
 conferred an honorary doctorate at edinburgh university and aberdeen 0:ab 0:erdeen university currie wrote edinburgh has tickled his vanity to 
 such an extent that i believe he is raising his grant of 125 000 to 4 000 000 to found 
 there the macaulay institute as it turned out that year macaulay indeed donated a further 3 000 to edinburgh for 
 research in sex physiology and 1 500 for a rat house he also created the macaulay laboratory in the institute 
 of animal genetics the macaulay research fellowship and even the macaulay lectureship in animal genetics of which wiesner was the 
 first holder 39 collip in the meantime had been forging ahead with his scientific work but he could not help 
 but be very disturbed by this situation he reported to martin that he had been plugging along at full speed 
 without 0:with 0:out a break and was just about ready for a holiday and change as for the issue of 
 giving credit he declared personally i have a clear conscience as far as doing justice to wiesner is concerned after 
 his experience with hanson in the parathyroid hormone episode collip took great care to credit his predecessors in this work 
 particularly wiesner in several of his publications he made prominent mention of wiesner s visit to his laboratory and of 
 wiesner s urgent request that collip try his hand at the isolation of the placental factors in a paper submitted 
 in april 1930 collip stated explicitly that his work may be said to be built upon and to be the 
 outcome of the earlier work of wiesner and his collaborators collip admitted to martin that he was aware that the 
 edinburgh investigators might have been hurt that he had withheld his method of extraction from them until april but he 
 
 j b collip 76 assured him that he was intending to send them a copy of his second paper which 
 contained a detailed description of the method he was anxious that he not be in any way to be the 
 means of possible discord 0:dis 0:cord between the two universities for this reason he asked martin to visit the group 
 in edinburgh to determine what their feelings were in the matter 40 a second principle in the laboratory it became 
 apparent to collip that some other principle 0:princi 0:ple was present in the placenta that had yet to be accounted 
 for he observed 0:ob 0:served that when a crude version of the extract was administered by injection rather than orally 
 it caused both the formation of corpora lutea and the phenomena of estrus however when a purified preparation 0:prepara 0:tion 
 of emmenin was given orally no corpora lutea appeared his observation 0:ob 0:servation fit in with the theories recently proposed 
 by wiesner and also by aschheim and zondek that two different principles acted on the ovary one that stimulated the 
 formation of follicles and caused estrus and another that caused the formation of corpora lutea other investigators 0:investi 0:gators argued 
 that the two functions were caused by one hormone and that the response of the ovary depended on how high 
 the dosage was to prepare emmenin collip first treated the pulped placental tissue with acetone or alcohol to begin extracting 
 the active principle next the solution was filtered and concentrated then it was treated with 85 percent alcohol emmenin remained 
 dissolved in the alcohol while other materials were precipitated out when collip worked up the residue 0:resi 0:due from this 
 precipitation he discovered that it contained a second principle he termed this second principle the anterior pituitary like substance because 
 it produced corpora lutea in the immature female rat and caused an increased rate of growth in the seminal vesicle 
 and prostate gland of immature male rats this substance also differed from emmenin in that it was not effective through 
 oral administration the secretary of the faculty of medicine j c simpson cabled martin 0:mar 0:tin in england on may 
 20 confidential collip working with residue from emmenin finds second hormone which may be identical asheim zondeck sic principle in 
 europe causes luteinization and hypertrophy 0:hypertro 0:phy of ovaries and hypertrophy and stimulation of seminal vesicles and prostate looks like 
 a clean up 41 thus it appeared that there were three hormones in the placenta the first estrin caused the 
 phenomena of estrus in both normal and castrated 0:cas 0:trated female rats and had a slight activity when administered orally 
 the second the fraction that collip called emmenin was soluble in 85 percent 0:per 0:cent alcohol and had similar effects 
 to estrin except that it was not 
 rebuilding medicine at mcgill 1928 193 3 77 effective in castrated animals and was orally active the third the anterior 
 pituitary like substance apl was insoluble in 85 percent alcohol 0:alco 0:hol and while also estrogenic had the added effect 
 of causing luteinization 0:luteiniza 0:tion collip hypothesized that emmenin and apl corresponded to the two ovary stimulating hormones described by 
 wiesner and by zondek and aschheim in pregnancy urine and the anterior pituitary standing on a higher plane the question 
 of patents the question of whether or not to patent medical products was hotly debated during this period although the 
 american medical community was more open to the idea of medical patents than the british even many prominent american researchers 
 questioned its appropriateness critics were particularly concerned that patents would be used to block research in certain areas they also 
 argued that taking out patents was inconsistent with the ideals of science which stipulated that knowledge was to be freely 
 contributed to a common pool harvard physiologist w b cannon stated in 1935 the evils of patenting substances which may 
 be essential for further advance in biology or which may be of therapeutic value and therefore not to be exploited 
 for the benefit of manufacturers are clear enough it seems to me utterly wrong also that someone who comes along 
 and who does a final job or even fails to contribute at all to the progress of research can take 
 out a patent on the product 0:prod 0:uct of many investigators and put himself into a position to make trouble 
 for others who want to work in the field 41 the british government had held a particularly ambivalent attitude towards 
 regulating therapeutic products especially in comparison with the german and american governments unlike germany and the united states where governmental 
 testing was provided as early as the late nineteenth century with the development of the diphtheria antitoxin 0:anti 0:toxin it 
 was not until after the first world war that the british government 0:govern 0:ment started to regulate the production of 
 salvarsan for the treatment of syphilis and only in 1925 that the therapeutic substances act was passed providing the government 
 with standards and enforcement guidelines for the testing of chemical and biological products jonathan liebenau argues that the activities of 
 the british medical research council mrc on insulin served as a model for later relations between the mrc and the 
 pharmaceutical industry the mrc officials were intensely 0:in 0:tensely interested in insulin in 1922 because they wanted to bring the 
 important product to britain control its production and prevent 
 78 j b collip improper commercial exploitation liebenau notes that the british mrc was reluctant to accept the offer of 
 the insulin patent rights from the university of toronto for two reasons first they feared that the patents would be 
 so inadequate that there would be grave difficulties in supervising and controlling manufacture and second the council was hesitant to 
 accept foreign standards sir walter fletcher secretary of the mrc expressed serious doubts about the appropriateness of the mrc being 
 involved in patenting but agreed that the mrc s laboratories 0:laborato 0:ries should conduct the research into standardizing the preparation 
 h w dudley and h h dale biochemists and members of the senior staff more pragmatically saw the need for 
 the mrc to serve as a facilitator 0:facili 0:tator of commercial production the mrc accepted the offer of the insulin 
 0:in 0:sulin patent but with the provision that the council not be obligated to defend the patent the council licensed 
 manufacturers tested batches coordinated clinical trials and conducted research into methods of lowering costs of production and standardization it also 
 helped to protect the british industry from imported insulin in doing this work the mrc faced fierce criticism its regulation 
 of research was called an unwarranted interference in the progress of science and its involvement 0:involve 0:ment in patenting was 
 challenged as leading to the commercialization of science liebenau argues that the mrc s work in later years was influenced 
 0:in 0:fluenced by the difficulties it had experienced with insulin production and by the fact that after 192 5 it 
 no longer had the incentive of fighting 0:fight 0:ing for the passage of the therapeutic substances act the effect was 
 that the mrc kept a greater distance from manufacturers as would be the case when penicillin was produced during the 
 second world war 43 by 1930 when the question of emmenin arose the british mrc had taken a stronger position 
 against medical patents since the discovery of insulin one of the major developments in therapeutics had been the production of 
 vitamin d by ultraviolet irradiation a method devised by henry steenbock at the university of wisconsin in 1924 steenbock s 
 0:steen 0:bock 0:s university had set up the wisconsin alumni research foundation 0:founda 0:tion warf in 1925 to hold and 
 manage the steenbock patents and later other patents taken out by wisconsin faculty members over the succeeding decades warf was 
 criticized by other researchers for its aggressive 0:ag 0:gressive style of patent management which had as its primary goal the 
 creation of a large endowment for research through the 1930s and 19405 the foundation was widely condemned for misusing its 
 patent ownership to set up monopolies to protect the state s dairy industry the mrc was particularly anxious about this 
 development because the production of vitamin d by irradiation had also been developed in its own laboratories supported by public 
 monies and freely published there was considerable doubt about the validity of the american 
 rebuilding medicine at mcgill 1928 1933 79 patent first because it was drawn in such wide terms that it covered 
 many subsequent valuable applications and second because it was claiming the rights to a natural process that is the action 
 of the ultraviolet 0:ultra 0:violet light of the sun nevertheless british manufacturers preferred to pay royalties to the american foundation 
 rather than risk litigation furthermore british researchers felt forestalled in conducting research in the area the fallout from warf s 
 management of the vitamin d patent was to become important in the mrc s response to emmenin 44 for walter 
 fletcher the mrc s most pressing concern was to ensure that patents would not become an obstacle to further research 
 by other scientists the council policy stated first in 19x8 and reaffirmed in 193 1 was that it would accept 
 patent rights where it was deemed in the public interest whether to allow for the development of a discovery or 
 to prevent exploitation it would however not countenance patenting 0:pat 0:enting in any case where by reason of an attempt 
 to cover unexplored ground or otherwise this step seems likely to hamper the freedom of research or to discourage further 
 investigation the council recommended 0:recom 0:mended that patents on medical products be abolished or at least be dedicated to a 
 public body on a compulsory basis fletcher told collip that the mrc had been funding wiesner s research for some 
 time and that in recent months wiesner had reported that he would soon be able to supply two of the 
 placental substances for extensive clinical trials there was no proposal to take out patents on those preparations but fletcher had 
 some concern that wiesner s trials and use of the product might be hampered by the commercial considerations of others 
 i have quite frankly mentioned the possibilities of difficulty for us which the situation seems to include because i believe 
 that you will sympathize 0:sympa 0:thize with our point of view i would at the same time assure you that 
 we are no less anxious that the results of your own work should be brought by whatever means may seem 
 best to practical application in this country and elsewhere 4s henry dale added with whatever firm or firms in this 
 country you make an arrangement i hope that any licence will include a clause making it clear that they have 
 no right to interfere with the production of your product for purposes of investigation 46 charles martin travelled to britain 
 in may accompanied by walter chipman their first stop was in edinburgh to meet with crew and wiesner to try 
 to determine their position on emmenin martin reported 0:re 0:ported back that he liked the edinburgh scientists and found that 
 there is no foundation for worry about crew c wiesner they were both most cordial frank he added that they 
 were having difficulties 0:difficul 0:ties reproducing collip s experiments but as martin had confidence in collip s abilities he thought 
 that it must be a problem with their 
 80 j b collip technique he added reassuringly one thing is certain they admire collip his work his appreciation of 
 their efforts are only too anxious to see him get all possible benefit 47 martin and chipman then travelled to 
 london to meet with the officials 0:offi 0:cials of the medical research council currie was anxious to maintain cordial relations 
 with the council and collip too wanted to ensure that mcgill would not patent or license in britain unless the 
 british mrc approved the personal connection between david thomson collip s associate and his father sir landsborough thomson then second 
 0:sec 0:ond secretary of the mrc must have made the importance of good relations 0:re 0:lations even more clear simpson 
 secretary of the faculty of medicine wired martin in london with the suggestion that he go a reasonable way to 
 meeting the wishes of council officials in the negotiations martin 0:mar 0:tin who counted walter fletcher a personal friend went 
 with chipman 0:chip 0:man to meet with fletcher and dale in the council offices and later at claridge s hotel 
 martin had learned in edinburgh that there was considerable 0:con 0:siderable concern arising in britain about difficulties that researchers were 
 encountering with patents issued in north america and germany he wrote to currie there is much feeling here on this 
 subject owing to steenbock of madison having collared the patent on all irradiated foods rather shocking i think and not 
 a credit to the university martin reported that both fletcher and dale deplored the practice of universities holding patents as 
 a bad principle for academic institutions 0:institu 0:tions and as a very bad example for the future fletcher and dale 
 had told him that they had accepted the patent for insulin only because no law had existed in britain that 
 allowed them to standardize the preparation 0:prepa 0:ration legally since the 1925 therapeutic substances act however they felt it was 
 unnecessary for a university to protect itself with patents 0:pat 0:ents in fact the council stopped paying the renewal fees 
 on its patents for insulin after 193 1 allowing them to lapse since it deemed the patents 0:pat 0:ents no 
 longer necessary for ensuring the quality of the product fletcher and dale indicated that they would find it a relief 
 if mcgill would stand on a higher plane and agree to forego a patent the mrc officers were amenable to 
 mcgill receiving royalties without a patent and to the idea of giving lilly and ayerst a period of exclusive rights 
 to allow them a fair start in the market they hoped however that at the end of the period collip 
 would send his formula to the mrc for safekeeping and to ensure the control of its use in research and 
 manufacturing martin and chipman agreed after hearing all the evidence 0:ev 0:idence we doubt if it is wise for mcgill 
 to issue a patent and we would certainly have a better academic standing among our british colleagues 0:col 0:leagues if 
 we refrained martin added that dale and fletcher spoke of collip s personal academic attitude in the very highest terms

 rebuilding medicine at mcgill 1928 193 3 81 in the end in deference to the wishes of the british mrc 
 the mcgill group decided not to patent the product martin and collip as english canadian medical scientists of this era 
 were anxious to adhere to the code of honour set out by the british medical and scientific community they felt 
 that sufficient protection could be given the pharmaceutical firms cooperating with them by simply allowing them a period of exclusive 
 0:exclu 0:sive licence during which they could gain a head start on their competitors 0:competi 0:tors 49 it is also 
 true that the british stance in this matter was not simply one of principle but also included some self interest 
 the mrc was actively 0:ac 0:tively protecting a piece of scientific work that it had invested in this episode reflects 
 the conflicts engendered by the growing importance of commerce to medical science in one respect the mcgill group was anxious 
 0:anx 0:ious to exploit the commercial potential of their laboratory finding this fit with curries view of scientific work as 
 a horse race in which the whole prize goes to the winner in another respect collip and martin were aware 
 that any accomplishment in science is founded upon the work of others in this scheme it was unfair to allow 
 someone who had only completed the final link in the chain to reap all the rewards continuing research by the 
 summer the problems in the laboratory and the troubles with macaulay were weighing heavily on collip and he felt ready 
 for a holiday 0:holi 0:day he remarked to martin that he was having so much difficulty with things going wrong 
 and was in such a state that he felt he had to clear out for a breathing space he spent 
 the summer in britain with his family but made his first stop at edinburgh upon landing he immediately met with 
 wiesner and crew at his hotel delighted to receive 0:re 0:ceive a warm welcome from them he spent a further 
 week in edinburgh 0:edin 0:burgh and aberdeen before proceeding south to london where he met with henry dale and walter 
 fletcher 50 instead of taking a holiday as planned collip immediately took the opportunity to start up his research at 
 the national institute for medical 0:medi 0:cal research nimr at hampstead the mrc s central laboratories by july he was 
 able to report to martin that he had been hard at work for a month working up over a hundred 
 kilograms of placentas he commented 0:com 0:mented that he was getting enough biological assays finished to cheer me up in 
 great style although he was unable to prepare the highly purified product that he had also sought to make in 
 february he was delighted to find that his hampstead preparation was equal to or better than any he had made 
 before he happily noted and as i have been working with a different colony of rats which have not as 
 yet learned the bad habits of montreal rats i feel very gratified indeed 51 
 j b collip 82 collip s theory about the identity of emmenin changed as his work progressed until april he 
 had been certain that his product was one of the ovary stimulating hormones that wiesner had isolated while in england 
 0:en 0:gland he began to suspect that emmenin was some new hormone with characteristics somewhere between those of estrin and 
 wiesner s rho i and rho n complex in fact he recognized that its properties were even closer to those 
 of estrin than to those of the ovary stimulating principle of the anterior pituitary he wrote to martin i was 
 a bit worried about this for a time but i cannot believe that i have been working with oestrin he 
 was confident that he had taken every precaution to remove estrin with washes of ether and that he had managed 
 to exclude estrin as far as possible with known methods he admitted that he could have presented this information more 
 clearly in his first paper had he known the results of the more recent work but he had been anxious 
 to publish his method in detail as early as possible so that his claims could be tested by others finally 
 he reported that he had managed to squeeze in a holiday 0:holi 0:day despite himself in spite of all my 
 worries i have managed to enjoy the change mrs collip and the children have had a wonderful time in london 
 too we have taken in nearly all the theatres and on the weekends 0:week 0:ends we have gotten out to 
 the sea or country sl at the end of august collip and his family finished their british stay and set 
 sail for montreal he left his precious placental extracts behind entrusted to the care of henry dale whom he asked 
 to arrange for a clinical trial unfortunately others at the nimr were not as confident of the value of these 
 extracts as collip was a s parke another endocrine 0:endo 0:crine researcher at the institute at the time later recalled 
 the events he dubbed the affair of the collip cocktail the extract which filled a row of half gallon bottles 
 and occupied valuable space in the institute s small cold room was left behind by collip for clinical trial the 
 recommended dose if i remember rightly being 80 ml twice a day by mouth it proved to be an embarrassing 
 legacy sir henry then director of the institute probably torn between a desire to liberate his cold room and reluctance 
 0:reluc 0:tance to arrange clinical trials of such a nebulous product passed the problem to the newly formed sex hormones 
 committee s3 parkes was instructed to call an emergency meeting of the committee 0:commit 0:tee to determine the fate of 
 the extract the committee members cautiously agreed to do some laboratory tests on it and discovered that the brew contained 
 about 60 per cent alcohol at its next meeting the committee solemnly reported that no reliable clinical trials can be 
 performed without the most thorough investigation of the effect of control preparations of alcohol parkes concluded so 
 rebuilding medicine at mcgill 1928 1933 83 far as i know the written record does not state what happened to 
 the row of bottles in the cold r00m 54 by the latter part of 1930 collip was obtaining more data 
 linking emmenin 0:em 0:menin with estrin earlier he had felt that emmenin s ineffectiveness in castrated animals was proof that 
 his extract was not the same as estrin he was finding however that emmenin could be made effective in adult 
 castrated animals if taken in very large doses and in immature animals that were freshly castrated furthermore studies failed to 
 find any anatomical 0:ana 0:tomical change in the ovaries of rats treated with emmenin as would be expected if it 
 were an ovary stimulating substance by april 1932 collip had concluded that emmenin was not an ovary stimulating substance as 
 he had originally thought but rather an estrogenic agent collip s colleague and doctoral student j s l browne had 
 made a parallel 0:par 0:allel study browne had worked up the estrin in the ether washes and had prepared a 
 crystalline compound from it collip and browne determined that this substance was identical in gross chemical and physiological properties to 
 the emmenin fraction they had to conclude therefore that emmenin was a form of estrin and that it existed in 
 two configurations 0:configura 0:tions one that was soluble in ether and had been removed in the ether washes and a 
 second the original fraction they had called emmenin that was not soluble in ether the portion that was ether insoluble 
 could be rendered ether soluble by hydrolysis under high pressure collip announced 0:an 0:nounced that emmenin could also be prepared 
 from the urine of pregnant 0:preg 0:nant animals it became apparent that his product was similar to or possibly identical 
 with the estrogenic substances produced by several other investigators in recent years among those were the theelol of edward 0:ed 
 0:ward doisy at st louis the trihydroxy oestrin isolated in 1930 by guy marrian at university college london and the 
 similar compound prepared 0:pre 0:pared by adolf butenandt in gottingen in 19 29 collip s study of his other fraction 
 the anterior pituitary like hormone 0:hor 0:mone of the placenta proved to be fruitful apl had many features in common 
 with the ovary stimulating hormones of the pituitary but there were also important differences between them in pursuing the questions 
 of whether or not the placental and pituitary principles were identical and how many ovary stimulating hormones there were collip 
 was drawn into the study of the hormones of the anterior pituitary itself 0:it 0:self this field would occupy him 
 for the remainder of his years in the laboratory and he would make important contributions to it significantly 0:signifi 0:cantly 
 collip and his group were able to demonstrate that the placental apl was indeed a different principle from the pituitary 
 substance in later years martin remarked that he was satisfied with their decisions 0:deci 0:sions about the commercial development of 
 emmenin thank god we have never patented the thing if for no other reason than that it has 
 j b collip 848 4 pleased fletcher and the other members of the medical research council 0:coun 0:cil the decision 
 not to patent however led to some difficulties for their commercial partner the older ethical code of medical scientists became 
 more and more difficult to uphold in the face of science s increasing involvement with the competitive and profit oriented 
 field of drug manufacture by 1932 the growing understanding of the chemical composition of emmenin made it possible for other 
 manufacturers to prepare the product mcgill had more than a financial stake in the success 0:suc 0:cess of the product 
 it also had an interest in ensuring that anything sold under the name of emmenin met collip s standards of 
 efficacy a market for the product had been created because it had been shown to be effective in several types 
 of menstrual disorder it was popular because 0:be 0:cause it could be easily and safely given by mouth although other 
 forms of estrin had some oral activity they were generally injected parenterally s6 ayerst mckenna harrison became particularly concerned about 
 protecting its investment the firm had worked closely with mcgill and had initially obliged its collaborators by respecting their wish 
 not to patent emmenin later however difficulties with one of their other products persuaded the ayerst directors that they had 
 to take greater measures to safeguard emmenin in october 1932 the wisconsin alumni research foundation notified the firm that it 
 was infringing on a patent held by warf for the use of copper and iron for the treatment of anemia 
 this product had been available in canada and the united states since february 1930 and ayerst had marketed it as 
 cupron then in september 1932 edwin hart patented the product for warf ayerst s directors felt unable to contest the 
 patent not only because they believed that the law was on the side of the foundation but also because ayerst 
 was under licence by warf to manufacture another important 0:im 0:portant product vitamin d mckenna explained the situation as the 
 directors saw it if this foundation cancelled our license on vitamin d it would mean a severe financial loss to 
 us in fact we would be obliged to withdraw certain preparations from the market on which we have spent considerable 
 money since 1923 mckenna urged martin 0:mar 0:tin to allow the company to protect its investment in emmenin arguing that 
 his experience in the commercial field had taught him that unless suitable copyrights were taken out it was only a 
 matter of time before some american company would gain the exclusive rights to the product 0:prod 0:uct he warned that 
 such an occurrence would deter manufacturers from investing time and effort in the development of a product their work could 
 be so easily jeopardized by those who had put no investment 0:invest 0:ment of their own into a product but 
 simply knew how to make the law work in their favour 57 
 rebuilding medicine at mcgill 1918 1933 85 martin was sympathetic to mckenna s concerns because he recognized 0:recog 0:nized that 
 the firm had invested more money than it could reasonably hope to get back for quite some time and therefore 
 it deserved some protection moreover he feared that other companies might produce emmenin without consulting collip and that their versions 
 of the product 0:prod 0:uct might reflect badly on mcgill while no patent rights were possible 0:possi 0:ble mcgill agreed 
 to give the firm the exclusive rights to the trade name emmenin first in canada and the united states and 
 later in britain 0:brit 0:ain as well with the condition that the method of manufacture be controlled 0:con 0:trolled by 
 the mcgill biochemistry department this did not limit manufacture of the product to ayerst and its british partner glaxo but 
 it gave them the advantage of reaching the market with a product with a familiar sounding name 58 in december 
 1934 ayerst encountered further difficulties this time with establishing the trade name on the american market after acquiring 0:acquir 0:ing 
 the rights to market emmenin in the united states ayerst set up an american subsidiary and a plant at rouses 
 point in new york in preparation 0:prep 0:aration for distributing emmenin on the american market ayerst submitted 0:sub 0:mitted an 
 application to the american medical association ama council on pharmacy and chemistry for acceptance of the trade name approval by 
 the council was virtually essential if a firm hoped to be successful in presenting a product to american physicians the 
 council however determined that the name emmenin was inappropriate according 0:ac 0:cording to mckenna and harrison the ama representatives were 
 opposed 0:op 0:posed to the name because the council s rules stipulated that names should not be therapeutically suggestive instead 
 they suggested some name that indicated the origin of the substance such as placentamine 0:placenta 0:mine while the council representatives 
 did not like the name emmenin 0:emme 0:nin they were willing to accept collip s designation since he was the 
 discoverer but only as the non proprietary name ayerst was faced with the prospect of either having to share the 
 name that the firm had spent four years developing a market for or selecting a new name and starting again 
 mckenna pleaded to martin that it seems to us this course is rather drastic and indeed unfair alternately if the 
 council agreed to allow ayerst to use emmenin as its trade name it would likely adopt another name as the 
 non proprietary name and collip would be faced with the probability that his discovery would be known by some other 
 name in the american medical literature the firm asked martin to apply pressure on the ama and on the canadian 
 medical association 0:as 0:sociation cma as well mckenna reported that although ayerst had not yet established permanent representation on the 
 american market its sales during the previous month were over 40 per cent greater in the united states than in 
 canada where it had been working intensively at 
 j b collip 86 developing the market for some time this indicates something of the possibilities of the american field 
 and the importance of consistently safeguarding the university s interest in the name under which this material 0:ma 0:terial is 
 to be marketed there s9 martin solicited the support of the cma arguing that while mcgill was firmly opposed to 
 taking out any patent it wanted to ensure the integrity of the product by placing its manufacture and distribution in 
 the hands of a firm in which it had confidence he explained further that the university had been very satisfied 
 with its part in the arrangement 0:arrange 0:ment but recognized that ayerst had not yet profited by it because the 
 company had to surmount great difficulties in the manufacturing process 0:pro 0:cess the name emmenin was particularly important not only 
 on sentimental 0:senti 0:mental grounds it had been suggested by a b macallum who had since died but because the 
 university would have no control over the use of the name and could not ensure the integrity of the product 
 the cma responded favourably by sending a letter to the ama asking it to reconsider the ayerst application however in 
 a final decision morris fishbein of the ama replied that his council was unable to break its own rules and 
 that emmenin would not be considered a satisfactory designation 60 throughout its dealings with ayerst the mcgill group found the 
 firm to have acted honourably not only fulfilling all its promises but going beyond their written obligations and meeting every 
 legitimate request 0:re 0:quest made of them in return the success of emmenin helped establish ayerst as an important player 
 in the pharmaceutical market as one of the first orally active estrogens emmenin brought a great deal of interest 0:inter 
 0:est from endocrinologists and gynaecologists the establishment of a successful american subsidiary by a canadian pharmaceutical company 0:com 0:pany was 
 unique and only made possible by the company s collaboration 0:collabora 0:tion with mcgill on emmenin the factor preventing competitors 
 from entering into the manufacture of emmenin was the prohibitive price of the raw materials ayerst was able to develop 
 a good supply of placentas 0:pla 0:centas in montreal and when it opened its rouses point plant the firm managed 
 to arrange for a special permit to export placentas from montreal 61 in the 1940s the market for emmenin was 
 challenged by the development 0:develop 0:ment of a synthetic alternative stilbestrol particularly the compound diethylstilbestrol dcs the synthetic estrogen was 
 orally active twenty times more potent than natural estrogens and much less expensive to produce dcs became the first widely 
 used product for estrogen replacement 0:replace 0:ment therapy in treating a variety of gynaecological conditions such as vaginitis amenorrhea dysmenorrhea 
 the symptoms of menopause the inhibition of lactation and with tragic results that were only discovered 0:discov 
 rebuilding medicine at mcgill 1928 193 3 87 ered later the prevention of miscarriage at the request of ayerst mcgill 
 agreed to reduce the royalties it received from 5 per cent to 2 per cent so that ayerst could market 
 its product more cheaply in order meet the expected competition 62 in addition ayerst s research team developed a more 
 potent orally active form of natural estrogen called premarin this was an even more successful product than emmenin and it 
 transformed ayerst s american arm into a large profitable operation the company continued 0:contin 0:ued to maintain its ties with 
 mcgill and collip and advertised on its packaging that emmenin and premarin had been standardized in collip s lab in 
 return for using the reputations of collip and mcgill ayerst paid royalties towards collip s research on both emmenin and 
 its own product premarin in 1943 the firm was acquired by american home products corporation 3 by the end of 
 the century premarin would become the top selling prescription drug in north america making ayerst s successor wyeth ayerst 1 
 9 billion in global sales and giving it two thirds of the market share for menopause drugs 4 the fact 
 that collip s research produced results that were both theoretically 0:theo 0:retically and therapeutically significant was important to the survival 
 of his research enterprise the royalties from emmenin proved to be a considerable financial boon to collip s laboratory and 
 to mcgill the accumulated royalties amounted to 77 743 by 1940 and the income for 1939 40 alone was 21 
 9x5 in recognition of the importance of their collaboration ayerst directors anonymously donated a sum of 5 000 to collip 
 s department in 1933 in commenting on this modest evidence of our appreciation they wrote we know that our connection 
 0:connec 0:tion with mcgill university particular through the department of biochemistry 0:bio 0:chemistry has been the means of creating a 
 confidence in our firm that we would not have otherwise enjoyed martin regarded the news of the donation as a 
 bright spot in the gloomy world and noted that apparently there were not strings to the gift other than that 
 it should be used in the department of biochemistry 6s that same year vincent massey donated two annual grants of 
 5 000 from the massey foundation to the work of collip s laboratory 0:labora 0:tory saying my wife and i 
 have been much impressed by what we have heard of the importance of the work carried on by dr collip 
 to currie the foremost value of collip s research was its contribution to therapeutics and this value was amply borne 
 out by public acclaim and the accompanying financial support currie replied to massey collip 0:col 0:lip is that sort of 
 investigator who has the faculty of achieving definite results there is much scientific investigation which is abstract such investigation 0:in 
 0:vestigation is by no means to be condemned nor must one always look for what may be called useful results 
 but i confess that to me there is 
 j b collip 88 an added pleasure when the new truth discovered can be made to serve in a positive 
 way the well being of mankind 66 achieving definite results as the chief of a laboratory collip was an entrepreneur 
 of science 67 he had to maintain a delicate balance in negotiating among the scientific 0:scien 0:tific medical academic and 
 commercial worlds the results of his research 0:re 0:search had a scientific significance as a contribution to the knowledge of 
 the hormones of the placenta and of their relation to the other hormones 0:hor 0:mones of reproduction the therapeutic value 
 of his knowledge had considerable importance in the evolving relations among the medical community the university and the pharmaceutical industry 
 in turning his laboratory findings to commercial use he had to try to compromise between the traditional honour bound rules 
 of how scientific knowledge 0:knowl 0:edge should be disseminated and the sometimes conflicting requirements 0:require 0:ments of the marketplace although 
 bowing to the wishes of the british medical research council in its desire to respect the conventions of the scientific 
 and medical communities collip and the mcgill officers also had to meet the needs of their industrial partner since effective 
 commercial 0:com 0:mercial production of emmenin was key to public recognition and the financial stability of the research operation collip 
 s research took on a more diffuse meaning in the public eye as a symbol of humanitarianism and a contribution 
 to pubic welfare it was this view of the research that drew the donations from the macaulays 0:macaul 0:ays and 
 the masseys collip had to navigate among the several differing 0:differ 0:ing meanings of biomedical knowledge and the differing sets 
 of rules in his attempts to build and maintain his research enterprise 
 5 the great years 1934 1941 collip was one of the nurserymen in our forest whom we saw rushing from 
 tree to tree fresh from the insulin tree he hastened to the parathyroid tree and then was off to the 
 sex gland trees what he learned from one tree he applied to the next fuller albright and read ellsworth uncharted 
 seas 1 for about 10 years everything was good fun j b collip to herbert evans 15 april 1964 2 
 the 1930s have been called the great years of collip s research career during this decade he and his staff 
 produced important contributions to the understanding of the anterior pituitary hormones collip was able to make the transition from working 
 with one or two associates to heading up a large laboratory group a configuration that was to become characteristic of 
 modern medical research the scientific successes 0:suc 0:cesses of this group depended on collip s ability to create an atmosphere 
 0:atmo 0:sphere of cooperation and teamwork the biochemistry department was a hub of activity throughout this period the small permanent 
 staff of five or six was supplemented by a constantly changing group of up to a dozen post graduate workers 
 three or four graduate students from both medical and biochemical backgrounds and a dozen technicians making up to twenty to 
 thirty people at any particular time those in the department remember it as a time of tremendous excitement and enormous 
 productivity during which almost two hundred papers were published david thomson remembered 0:re 0:membered that the department was full to 
 overflowing and the exhilarating 0:exhil 0:arating wine of rapid progress animated successive batches of graduate students he recalled enthusiastic discussions 
 about new ideas at all hours of the day and night and rushing down to the station to put a 
 white hot manuscript on the new york train so that it could be included 0:in 0:cluded in the next proceedings 
 of the society for experimental biology and medicine at the centre of all this activity was collip himself called the 
 chief by his loyal co workers collip s restless driven 
 j b collip 90 nature showed itself best in his endless extractions of the tissues of tens of thousands of 
 cattle sheep and hogs his associate robert noble recalled to meet collip in those days one was ushered by mr 
 long having previously established one s credentials into a room reeking of caprylic alcohol that steamed from electrically heated garbage 
 pails containing io litre flasks connected 0:con 0:nected to a still through a deafening high vacuum pump enormous filter funnels 
 0:fun 0:nels covered the benches and were being continuously filled from two gallon battery jars conversation was impossible as collip 
 dashed from one tank to another until he would finally step out of the room with a small flask of 
 brown liquid representing the concentrated activity of some hundreds of pounds of starting material this picture became a symbol of 
 the activity and it continued well into the night characteristically work went on until i or i a m and 
 collip 0:col 0:lip would rarely miss a night at the lab 3 although some might have assumed that the tedious 
 work of chemical 0:chemi 0:cal extraction was more suitably carried out by a technician it remained 0:re 0:mained collip s 
 great joy to do this part of the work himself david thomson has suggested that the long silent hours at 
 the still may have allowed collip to develop his best ideas as collip darted about his stills and funnels adjusting 
 the ph of one extract or filtering the precipitate 0:pre 0:cipitate of another he smoked his trademark hand rolled oversized 
 cigarettes dropping ashes on his vest as he went along each extract seemed to contain a slight modification the recipe 
 for which was jotted down in his little black notebook much to the dismay of those who might want to 
 duplicate his results one long time colleague abe neufeld 0:neu 0:feld recalled that dennis o donovan an irish medical student 
 who was doing post graduate work in the lab at the time would say to him annoyed abe why doesn 
 t he tell how he makes those extracts the extracts collip prepared were then put in the large refrigerators for 
 the use of the other members of the lab 4 the many projects of the students and associates created a 
 whirl of activity around collip o donovan recalled that the chief was constantly 0:con 0:stantly involved in his brewing activities 
 so that he had little time to communicate with the other workers however collip made it clear that each member 
 of the department was to help the others and that all problems were to belong to the group as a 
 whole a key means of promoting 0:pro 0:moting this feeling of teamwork was the tradition of taking tea at four 
 o clock every day at teatime each member of the group learned about and ardently discussed the findings of the 
 others friends and associates 0:associ 0:ates from other departments and universities were known to drop by for these sessions while 
 generally shy in social situations collip loved 
 the great years 1934 194 1 91 being in this atmosphere of excitement and intense activity and he became particularly 
 animated when new ideas caught his interest his student j s l browne recalled he was quick of mind and 
 from his questions in conversation it was apparent that his mind ran ahead of the speaker anticipating the possible implications 
 and ramifications of every word s new students joining the department were sometimes left to their own devices as the 
 chief felt confident that they would become absorbed 0:ab 0:sorbed into the laboratory family through interaction with other members of 
 the group this was the style of training that collip had received 0:re 0:ceived from macallum at toronto two decades 
 before those who were suitably prepared fared well and came to appreciate that collip was giving them a chance to 
 show what they were capable of those who were less prepared who expected their supervisor to tell them what to 
 do would find themselves assigned more often than not to test collip s 0:col 0:lip 0:s abstracts abe neufeld a 
 phd student at the university of manitoba 0:mani 0:toba remembered feeling lost after arriving in montreal to do a year 
 of study under collip once collip had ascertained that the newcomer had lodgings and sufficient funds he simply deposited him 
 at the bench he was to use and departed with the comment that he would see him later fortunately neufeld 
 was indeed soon absorbed into the family through his discussions with leonard pugsley neufeld learned that some monkeys were available 
 and he soon devised the idea of using them to study experimental diabetes some time later collip came to inquire 
 of neufeld s progress and learned of this plan neufeld recalled before i had gone any further i was in 
 dr collip s office and he did most of the talking and i can say only with tremendous enthusiasm that 
 half hour i really learned what dr collip was like an absolute fountain of ideas and always miles ahead of 
 you 6 collip s daughter barbara was very close to him and spent a lot of time in the laboratory 
 while she was growing up her father would take her in with him on the weekends when she was a 
 girl if he were called away to the telephone she would sometimes be left watching some brew perhaps a little 
 eyedropper in hand and with the instruction not to let the important stuff boil over later when she was studying 
 at mcgill she went up to the lab after class every day and waited to go home with him during 
 the summers she would work there learning how to clean glassware and perform simple tests 7 john browne described the 
 laboratory organization this way the chief generated the ideas and set the pace the team members carried out the work 
 when collip returned from visits to other labs he was often particularly excited inspired by what he had learned while 
 his enthusiasm was infectious his drive and impatience with slow progress 
 j b collip 92 sometimes made it difficult for others to keep up with him neufeld recalled 0:re 0:called having 
 to say but dr collip i have only two hands and there are only 24 hours in a day how 
 can you expect me to do all that you want to have done visitors to the laboratory remembered it as 
 a hive of activity with eager workers at their benches until all hours of the night and temporary members all 
 wanting to stay on indefinitely 8 collip s second in command david thomson participated less and less in the laboratory 
 work as the years went on but he took on the work of much of the teaching in the department 
 this contribution was significant in that it freed collip to pursue the research work for which he was so much 
 better suited hans selye a skilled anatomist and histologist 0:his 0:tologist trained in prague joined the department in 1930 selye 
 possessed 0:pos 0:sessed both an md and a phd he had started a one year rockefeller research fellowship at johns 
 hopkins when he became homesick and decided to go to canada to work with collip hoping that canada would be 
 more european in culture he spent the second half of his year at mcgill and went back to prague at 
 the conclusion of his fellowship 0:fellow 0:ship when collip offered him a position as lecturer in his department he leapt 
 at the opportunity and returned to montreal permanently in 1933 evelyn anderson also an md and phd had come from 
 the university 0:uni 0:versity of california at berkeley to work with collip as a national research 0:re 0:search council fellow 
 she too stayed on after her fellowship expired while collip could only offer her a small salary he remarked to 
 a rockefeller officer that she was worth worlds more rounding out this group was a constantly changing array of post 
 doctoral fellows independent 0:in 0:dependent investigators who attached themselves to the group with no salary several doctoral students and seven 
 or eight technicians one of collip s most brilliant students was j s l browne browne completed his doctorate with 
 collip in 1932 and went on to establish an important 0:impor 0:tant centre of research in clinical endocrinology at mcgill 
 9 collip s restless personality showed itself in the way he directed the work of the laboratory his style was 
 as robert noble described to skim the cream off a problem and then go quickly on to the next another 
 colleague r j rossiter remembered collip as possessing intense 0:in 0:tense feelings and strongly held views and as always quick 
 in thought and action rossiter also characterized him as an individualist who resisted 0:re 0:sisted regimentation he regarded collip as 
 a person of great integrity who even though he could be greatly upset by criticism would continue 0:con 0:tinue to 
 do what he thought to be right regardless of other people s opinions browne and denstedt described him as someone 
 who was apt to make decisions immediately sometimes just to get the matter off his mind once inspired by a 
 novel observation made by his co worker hugh long collip cancelled a family trip to australia at a few hours 
 
 the great years 1934 194 1 93 notice this characteristic carried over to his love of games especially where a 
 gamble was involved it displayed itself for example in his enthusiasm 0:en 0:thusiasm for playing the stock market noble described 
 the laboratory as sometimes seeming to be overrun with stockbrokers collip even had an extension telephone installed near his still 
 so that he could take quick action on the market his decisiveness and love of risk were complemented 0:com 0:plemented 
 by his ability to know how to cut his losses when an occasional choice failed to pan out his restless 
 personality was also evident 0:ev 0:ident in his famous exploits behind the wheel of a car browne and denstedt recalled 
 when not in the lab he was happiest on the highway 0:high 0:way with mrs collip by his side and 
 in the earlier years with the three children in the back seat going somewhere as fast as the speed limit 
 would permit noble joked that collip s driving was legendary among friends and acquaintances and was generally considered a form 
 of low flying many students were said to have found their first car trip to a conference with the chief 
 more memorable than the experience of presenting 0:pre 0:senting their first papers 10 ray collip was well known among her 
 husband s colleagues as a lovely warm hostess and a patient generous wife and mother married to bert she had 
 to be prepared for adventures at the spur of the moment 0:mo 0:ment in later years she learned to keep 
 a suitcase packed and ready to go just in case their daughter barbara remembers that one year her father was 
 dismayed to learn that the reservations he thought he had for his family at wood s hole were somehow lost 
 quickly he found out about a cruise ship with room available but that had already left halifax he arrived home 
 announcing to ray and the children we re leaving tomorrow for the west indies their bags hastily packed the family 
 boarded a train the next day for boston to catch up with the ship even on the cruise collip s 
 mind never strayed very far from his beloved research he convinced the captain to have a shark caught for him 
 the shark s pituitary was quickly removed for his research while its teeth went to the children as souvenirs collip 
 also collected a pair of monkeys one to be used for research the other to be a family pet 11 
 collip s habit of dashing from one problem to the next meant that individual subjects were perhaps not investigated with 
 the same attention 0:atten 0:tion they would receive in other laboratories m k mcphail a student in collip s lab 
 noted that when he later went on to hampstead in england 0:en 0:gland to do post graduate work he had 
 the impression that work there was done with more thoroughness than it had been at mcgill he remembered 0:re 0:membered 
 that the mcgill group had used somewhat crude techniques in photography and operative procedures and had taken less care in 
 preparing scientific data this he suggested undoubtedly was due in part to collip s interest in getting the important things 
 done and not 
 j b collip 94 wasting time with unnecessary details noble suggested that because of this many other laboratories benefited indirectly 
 being able to develop the mcgill group s observations in greater depth overall however those in the laboratory remembered this 
 period as a happy and exciting time mcphail remembered one incident when he browne pugsley and peter black were headed 
 to a scientific meeting 0:meet 0:ing in philadelphia that collip was not attending collip asked them if they planned to 
 take anything for snakebite this was during the days of prohibition in the u s a and he advised us 
 to take our own supplies and stay clear of bootlegged hootch we followed his advice and filled a number of 
 amber bottles with good scotch whisky labeling 0:label 0:ing them emminin every new year s eve the collips would hold 
 a big party at their home for all the members of the lab and their families 0:fami 0:lies daughter barbara 
 remembers these as tremendous fun with plenty of food and games even a mock casino adults and children alike could 
 play at roulette with rolls of new pennies mcphail recalled 0:re 0:called mrs collip would participate in party games quietly 
 and effectively 0:ef 0:fectively and her husband with such boyish exuberance that together they made the evening a joy to 
 everyone present at ping pong dr collip seemed to be more often than not on the floor on his hands 
 and knees retrieving balls at billiards he was much the same he would talk smoke brush ashes from his clothes 
 and make shots all at a rapid pace the group made a tradition of toasting the pituitary hormones at this 
 party may they multiply and during the great years they usually did 12 because of charles martin s efforts at 
 building the medical faculty and its research capabilities collip had a number of interesting colleagues 0:col 0:leagues in the biological 
 and medical sciences biochemistry was located 0:lo 0:cated on the third floor of the biological building on the floor above 
 was the department of physiology headed by boris babkin a russian refugee and a student of pavlov babkin was renowned 
 for his work in neurophysiology especially in relation to gastrointestinal secretion and motility his laboratory produced important work on the 
 hormone gastrin 0:gas 0:trin 13 on the floor above physiology was the department of pharmacology 0:pharma 0:cology headed by r 
 l stehle who was well known for his work on the posterior pituitary hormones in his free time collip was 
 able to cultivate the friendly acquaintance 0:acquain 0:tance of other scientists at mcgill he belonged to an informal group known 
 as the greenhouse follies club that met in the biological building s greenhouse laboratory on monday evenings for a cold 
 supper 0:sup 0:per and a congenial discussion of scientific problems the organizer of the group francis lloyd challenged the follies 
 with such problems as figuring out the mechanism of the trap in the plant euticulare that 
 the great years 19 34 1941 95 enabled it to catch insects the group included such members as david thomson 
 david keys of physics a friend of collip s since their trinity days the chemist otto maass fred johnstone george 
 w scarth a norman shaw and later a s eve roney d gibbs j j o neil c p martin 
 a physical anthropologist and the chair of anatomy t w n cameron v c wynne edwards e e burr and

 his south african origins l4 the school s two teaching hospitals provided other research colleagues 0:col 0:leagues at the royal 
 victoria hospital just a short walk up the street from the biological building was the university medical clinic directed 0:di 
 0:rected by j c meakins meakins introduced a new emphasis on original 0:origi 0:nal laboratory investigation setting up an independent 
 research unit in which the senior appointments were made to basic scientists rather than to clinicians c n h long 
 a talented physiological chemist from university college london was interested in the chemistry of muscular 0:muscu 0:lar function and its 
 relation to heart disease and anaesthesia he completed 0:com 0:pleted his undergraduate studies and his md in 1928 and left 
 montreal in 1933 he later became the sterling professor of physiology at yale and the dean of the faculty of 
 medicine when the neurological institute 0:insti 0:tute was completed in 1934 wilder penfield and william cone moved to their new 
 quarters the space they vacated in the hospital was then set up as a small laboratory for endocrinology research under 
 j s l browne eleanor m yenning who received her doctorate working with long in 1933 assisted browne with an 
 ever increasing number of investigators and using materials drawn from the maternity hospital browne built an important centre of clinical 
 research in endocrinology venning s contribution was her ability to develop simplified assay methods that opened up the study of 
 the metabolites of pregnancy and the hormones of the placenta and ovary with browne s clinical research 0:re 0:search complementing 
 collip s fundamental studies mcgill was an important 0:im 0:portant centre for endocrine work during the 1930s 15 the montreal 
 general hospital was located somewhat farther away from the university on dorchester street i m rab rabinowitch served as pathological 
 chemist and director of the hospital s diabetic clinic the largest in canada during the 19305 he was a keen 
 researcher 0:re 0:searcher and as early as 19 19 set up a biochemical laboratory in a corner 0:cor 0:ner of 
 the clinical laboratory despite the doubts of the hospital department chiefs as to the value of chemical procedures to clinical 
 practice rabinowitch introduced laboratory tests for blood sugar blood urea nitrogen and creatinine he had to make much of his 
 equipment for himself improvising with olive bottles from the kitchen to substitute for pyrex tests tubes and borrowing the analytical 
 balance 
 j b collip 96 from the department of biochemistry for his quantitative analyses this laboratory grew into the department of 
 metabolism and then in 1947 into the institute for special research and cell metabolism rabinowitch held an appointment at mcgill 
 and lectured on pathological 0:patholog 0:ical chemistry in collip s department 16 the endocrine gold rush competition in pituitary hormone 
 research hormone research was the focus of intense interest and competition among investigators during the 19305 and this period could 
 truly be described 0:de 0:scribed as an endocrine gold rush the hormones of the anterior pituitary 0:pitu 0:itary were particularly 
 interesting because the pituitary was increasingly regarded as a master gland responsible for regulating a vast range of bodily functions 
 including the control of growth and reproduction research 0:re 0:search centred on the problems of isolating identifying and determining the 
 physiological function of the several pituitary hormones collip s interest in the anterior pituitary hormones emerged from his work on 
 the anterior pituitary like hormone of the placenta apl considerable 0:con 0:siderable controversy surrounded the number and actions of the 
 various hormones of the pituitary and collip was drawn into the field because he wanted to determine whether or not 
 apl was the same as the pituitary 0:pitu 0:itary gonadotrophins the hormones that acted upon the gonads l7 an important 
 characteristic of endocrine research was that it was carried out by investigators from many different disciplines historians 0:histori 0:ans diana 
 long and thomas glick argue that the field of endocrinology 0:endocrinol 0:ogy was united by its subject matter the secretions 
 of the endocrine glands rather than by its methods over the course of its development 0:develop 0:ment the field was 
 dominated by different disciplinary approaches in turn first by morphology that is anatomy and histology then physiology then biochemistry and 
 finally molecular biology leading endocrine researchers of the 1920s and 1930s identified themselves variously as physiologists anatomists zoologists and biochemists 
 when endocrine research turned to the hormones involved in growth and reproduction it became increasingly characterized by interdisciplinary 0:interdisci 0:plinary 
 collaboration this feature of hormone studies can be seen in the composition of the research group at collip s laboratory 
 as well as that of many of the other leading groups success required the work of a team of investigators 
 who each brought special skills from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds 18 a number of laboratories around the world were 
 engaged in research on the anterior pituitary they produced findings rapidly so that determining 0:deter 
 the great years 1934 194 1 97 mining priority was sometimes difficult scientists from different disciplines 0:disci 0:plines contributed important 
 parts of the work the biochemist could extract and chemically characterize the active principles the physiologist 0:physiolo 0:gist and the 
 histologist could demonstrate the biological activity of the extract the laboratory groups that combined the skills of the biochemist 0:biochem 
 0:ist and the anatomist were particularly successful these labs contributed 0:contrib 0:uted key pieces of information on the hormones of 
 the anterior pituitary but there remained considerable controversy over the precise number and function of these hormones while collaboration was 
 essential to the success of these enterprises disciplinary biases were reflected 0:re 0:flected in the manner the very complex experimental 
 results were interpreted the interactions of collip s group with that of herbert mclean evans of the university of california 
 berkeley illustrates these tensions 0:ten 0:sions these two groups achieved notable successes by mastering a new experimental system that used 
 a hypophysectomized rat that is a rat from which the pituitary also known as the hypophysis had been surgically 0:sur 
 0:gically removed the hypophysectomized rat could then serve almost as a tabula rasa in pituitary replacement therapy the classic method 
 of endocrine research when the pituitary is surgically removed growth stops and the reproductive organs the thyroid gland and the 
 adrenal cortex begin to atrophy the researcher could test the biological activity 0:activ 0:ity of various extracts by injecting them 
 into this animal and determining 0:determin 0:ing whether they replaced any of the functions of the anterior pituitary the development 
 of the technique of hypophysectomy in the rat might be said to have transformed endocrinology prior to the early 19205 
 those who studied the function of the pituitary removed the gland from the experimental animal in a manner that produced 
 ambiguous 0:ambig 0:uous results the pituitary is located at the base of the brain to get to it investigators entered 
 through the cranium and lifted the brain the problem with this method was that severe brain damage could result leading 
 to bleeding and death furthermore it was difficult to ascertain whether the entire pituitary had been removed investigators therefore had 
 difficulty determining whether or not the effects they observed were truly due to the absence of the pituitary in 1925 
 philip smith an anatomist and colleague of herbert evans developed an alternative method of hypophysectomy in which he approached the 
 pituitary through a spot in the base of the skull this was a difficult operation to master but it allowed 
 him to remove the pituitary without touching the brain for when approached from this angle the pituitary is separated from 
 the brain above by a tough piece of tissue furthermore by using this technique smith could be sure that the 
 entire gland had been removed 0:re 0:moved he developed this technique to a high degree of perfection and 
 j b collip 9 8 was able to complete fifty to sixty operations a day his mastery of this parapharyngeal 
 approach meant that he was provided with a large number of experimental animals for the study of the pituitary he 
 was able to show that hypophysectomy led to the cessation of growth and the atrophy of the thyroid adrenal cortex 
 and reproductive organs l 9 experimentation in endocrinology entailed the use of new sources of research materials historian adele clarke 
 has described the changes in research materials necessitated by changes in methodology in the study of reproduction in the late 
 nineteenth and early twentieth centuries when the morphological approach predominated anatomists could spend a large part of their careers preparing 
 and preserving interesting specimens as the methods of experimental physiology began to overtake descriptive methods in the 19205 a demand 
 for large numbers of live animals 0:an 0:imals of the same species emerged researchers had to develop sizable colonies of 
 mice rats and guinea pigs in particular variations between individual animals had to be dealt with by using statistical studies 
 of large numbers of animals and by selective breeding researchers hoped to develop experimental animals of such uniformity that they 
 might be considered to be much the same as exact reagents or fine instruments 10 large numbers of experimental animals 
 were required in the work on the anterior pituitary hormones because some of these hormones acted on growth and reproduction 
 such functions were not apparent in immediate and readily measurable changes in a living organism but had to be examined 
 histologically that is through the microscopic study of anatomical structures experimental animals had to be killed at various stages of 
 the trial their tissues sectioned and the shape and size of the cells of these tissue slices examined under a 
 microscope collip s work on this line of research attained particular success after 1930 when hans selye joined his laboratory 
 as a research associate collip set him the task of learning smith s method of hypophysectomy in the rat selye 
 succeeded in mastering and further modifying the technique 0:tech 0:nique indeed he became so proficient at it that he was 
 able to complete 0:com 0:plete the operation in five minutes while achieving an unusually low mortality rate within months he 
 was able to prepare one hundred rats per day in this way his command of the technique provided the mcgill 
 group with the means of testing and purifying the many pituitary 0:pitu 0:itary fractions that collip prepared over the next 
 few years the lab members succeeded in making anterior pituitary extracts from cows sheep and pigs and tested them all 
 on selye s hypophosectomized rats using this system they were able to prepare active extracts of the thyroid stimulating hormone 
 and the adrenocorticotropic hormone 21 the combination of collip s skills as a biochemist with those of selye as a 
 histologist and anatomist gave the mcgill group a significant edge 
 the great years 1934 1941 99 in pituitary research collip fractionated the glandular extracts while selye provided the hypophysectomized animals 
 and performed the histological 0:his 0:tological examinations later jessie c williams a registered nurse and a technician in the lab 
 also learned to carry out the hypophysectomies collip attributed his group s success to the use of large numbers of 
 experimental animals in one facility for example collip developed an animal colony that included six to eight thousand white rats 
 he argued that the availability of a steady and large supply of animals was crucial to the success of their 
 venture reports in the literature on the effect of treating hypophysectomized animals with the anterior pituitary like hormone or prolan 
 or similar preparations are conflicting 0:con 0:flicting partly because the number of animals available for experimentation 0:experimen 0:tation has always 
 been small 11 collip and his group set out to prepare extracts of the principles responsible 0:re 0:sponsible for the 
 various activities of the anterior pituitary growth stimulation of the thyroid and stimulation of the adrenal cortex the first they 
 were able to prepare was the principle that stimulated growth in hypophysectomized rats an activity that evans had demonstrated many 
 years earlier this growth was measured in the weight gain of the animals over the course of treatment with the 
 extract 13 then together with evelyn anderson who had come from evans s lab for post graduate work collip isolated 
 the thyroid stimulating hormone of the pituitary called the thyreotropic hormone this hormone 0:hor 0:mone stimulated the thyroid gland to 
 secrete its own hormone which in turn stimulated the body metabolism the activity of the thyreotropic 0:thyreotro 0:pic hormone could 
 be seen in the increase in metabolism of the test animal as well as in hyperplasia of thyroid tissue the 
 metabolism was calculated in terms of the volume of oxygen consumed by the animal in relation to body surface and 
 was measured in a benedict multiplechamber 0:multiple 0:chamber respiration apparatus within the thyreotropic extracts collip 0:col 0:lip also pulled out 
 an adrenotropic hormone that restored to normal size the atrophied adrenals in hypophysectomized rats histological examination 0:ex 0:amination of the 
 adrenal cells showed that adrenals so treated were 50 to 300 per cent greater in weight than untreated glands collip 
 and his associates are credited with priority in the preparation of extracts of the thyreotropic and adrenocorticotropic hormone acth the 
 acth that collip prepared was in a fairly crude form only ten years later it was purified by two different 
 groups evans and his associates choh hao li and miriam simpson at berkeley and hugh long collip s former associate 
 and his co workers george sayers and abraham white at yale while the adrenocorticotropic hormone was important because of its 
 role in endocrine physiology it took on a great therapeutic 0:thera 0:peutic significance after 1949 when philip hench described the 
 use of 
 j b collip 100 cortisone in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis since acth stimulates 0:stimu 0:lates the release of cortisone 
 it began to be used therapeutically i4 collip was always very protective of his children and anxious to keep them 
 out of harm s way it must have been a frustrating irony for him that at the same time he 
 was making such progress in his hormone research his daughter margaret was suffering from an endocrine disorder 0:disor 0:der that 
 he was unable to alleviate she developed full blown hyperthyroidism 0:hyper 0:thyroidism when she was in college and had to 
 take complete rest 2 5 herbert mclean evans one of collip s chief competitors in the anterior pituitary work was 
 herbert mclean evans evans a leading figure in endocrinology evans possessed a stellar record of achievements and a powerful caustic 
 personality 0:per 0:sonality collip s debates with evans over the pituitary hormones are remembered by robert noble as legendary evans 
 received his bachelor of science at berkeley in 1904 and then trained in medicine and anatomy 0:anat 0:omy at johns 
 hopkins for the next ten years in 19 15 he returned to berkeley to head the anatomy department when he 
 first arrived philip smith was already working on hypophysectomy first on tadpoles and later on rats evans took up the 
 study of the pituitary and his work in isolating and identifying the various pituitary hormones became the focus 0:fo 0:cus 
 of his research for the next forty years he created an important centre of research the institute for experimental biology 
 serving as its director and bringing together a successful group of investigators 26 victor medvei credits evans with being one 
 of the first medical researchers 0:re 0:searchers to successfully switch from the mode of conducting research single handedly or with 
 one or two associates to the modern pattern of working in large teams evans was adept in his choice of 
 collaborators 0:collabora 0:tors selecting for example philip smith and george washington corner 0:cor 0:ner another important fellow worker was miriam 
 simpson whose training in medicine and chemistry complemented evans s skill in anatomy 0:anat 0:omy she used her special skills 
 to spearhead the endocrine portion of evans s research program biochemist choh hao li also an important associate was a 
 leading researcher on the chemistry of the anterior pituitary 0:pi 0:tuitary hormones evans and his colleague joseph long developed a 
 new strain of experimental rat the long evans rat that was described 0:de 0:scribed as attractively hooded vigorous but gentle 
 sturdy prolific and remarkably uniform they established a model colony that has been regarded as very important to the development 
 of endocrine research l 7 evans had begun his work on the anterior pituitary well over a decade 0:de 0:cade 
 before collip in 1920 he began working with crude extracts of 
 the great years 1934 1941 101 the gland examining their ability to accelerate growth he was able to produce giant 
 sized rats and later when he extended his experiments to other species he created monstrous dachshunds he and simpson undertook 
 a systematic effort to extract and purify the hormone responsible 0:re 0:sponsible the development of smith s technique of hypophysectomy 
 in the rat in 19z6 gave impetus to evans s study as this new system allowed 0:al 0:lowed him to 
 conduct a thorough study of the function of the various hormones from that point through the 19305 evans explored many 
 of the activities of the anterior pituitary in 1929 he and his associates discovered that a pituitary extract stimulated the 
 production of milk this led other investigators to the isolation of the hormone prolactin two years later evans and simpson 
 identified a diabetogenic activity in 1936 they prepared extracts of the gonadotrophic hormones and separated a follicle stimulating hormone fsh 
 luteinizing hormone lh and a third hormone that they called the interstitial cell stimulating 0:cell 0:stimulat 0:ing hormone icsh later 
 proved to be identical with lh i 8 work in this field was fiercely competitive with so many groups working 
 simultaneously on isolating pituitary hormones new discoveries 0:discover 0:ies often occurred at approximately the same time worry about secrecy 0:se 
 0:crecy dogged both evans s and collip s groups when evelyn anderson later went back to work for evans collip 
 expressed concern that she might take precious information about his extraction method to evans collip usually quite open about his 
 work had a particular wish to keep secrets from evans abe neufeld recalls that collip was not very secretive and 
 was comfortable sharing his results with almost everyone but evans for example when neufeld first arrived at the lab he 
 asked collip how free he should be in discussing results with the ayerst staff collip told him to treat them 
 just the same as anybody in the department 0:depart 0:ment when neufeld gave a presentation before rockefeller foundation 0:founda 0:tion 
 officials collip again told him to tell them everything neufeld thus described in detail how he developed his extracts however 
 when evans made one of his visits to collip s lab invariably neufeld and the other staff would be instructed 
 don t tell him anything neufeld admits 0:ad 0:mits laughingly that he cheated on collip once in a while neufeld 
 liked evans and when the big tall man came striding into the lab asking 0:ask 0:ing in his booming voice 
 what are you doing with those rats he found it difficult to hold back an honest answer 19 evans in 
 return complained to a rockefeller official that collip s group was too secretive about selye s modifications to the hypophysectomy 
 0:hypophysec 0:tomy technique it is not clear why evans was irked since the mcgill group had published a detailed description 
 of the method one that included 0:in 0:cluded a precise diagram it is interesting to note however that of the 
 scores of papers produced by collip s group during this period all but 
 j b collip 102 a very few were in english and that the key paper describing selye s surgical method 
 was one of these exceptions it appeared in german in virchows archiv this probably had more to do with german 
 being selye s first language than with any plot to hide information from the american competitors evans regularly cited scientific 
 papers in german 0:ger 0:man so this should not have been a serious obstacle 3o researchers came up with conflicting 
 theories on the number of hormones 0:hor 0:mones produced by the pituitary and their precise functions ideas were constantly in 
 flux at a panel discussion on the pituitary gland in 1935 collip was asked to comment on his current impression 
 of the number of active fractions to be derived from pituitary tissue he replied i am glad you asked me 
 to speak as of june 1935 because we may have quite a different impression a month or a year hence 
 investigators were able to identify a growth stimulating a thyroid stimulating an adrenal cortex stimulating and a gonad stimulating function 
 of the gonad stimulating fraction of the pituitary two further functions could be identified the stimulation of follicles and the 
 formation of corpora lutea in the ovary researchers debated whether these two functions represented the action of one or two 
 hormones furthermore researchers 0:research 0:ers differed on the question of whether the gonad stimulating fraction of the pituitary was identical 
 with the fraction isolated from pregnancy urine and the placenta one that produced similar effects neither biochemical 0:bio 0:chemical nor 
 histological evidence alone could provide a definitive answer 0:an 0:swer while biochemical procedures could be used to isolate particular functions 
 it was difficult to know whether the chemical extraction process itself altered the native hormone in some way perhaps separating 
 0:separat 0:ing segments of some master hormone molecule that carried several of these physiological functions together conversely histological methods 0:meth 
 0:ods could not determine the number of active principles in a test fraction 0:frac 0:tion nor did they indicate whether 
 different principles in the fraction might be acting synergistically or antagonistically these answers could only be attained by piecing together 
 a puzzle by comparing extracts prepared in a variety of ways and tested systematically in different biological 0:bio 0:logical assay 
 systems 31 both collip the biochemist and evans the anatomist recognized the value of the other s skills collip acknowledged 
 that the biological assays made possible by hypophysectomy had enabled his group to investigate the pituitary hormones systematically histological studies 
 were important 0:impor 0:tant components of his group s work in preparing hormones and describing 0:describ 0:ing their activities nevertheless 
 when it came to finding the definitive answer his biochemical predisposition became clear for example in the question of determining 
 whether gonad stimulating fractions of the pituitary 0:pitu 0:itary and the placenta were identical he said no one could doubt 
 the 
 the great years 1934 1941 103 similarity of certain physiological effects but the final proof of the identity of the 
 active principle in each must be chemical 3l evans for his part emphasized the importance of the technique of hypophysectomy 
 0:hy 0:pophysectomy to him these surgical triumphs had ushered in a new era of experimentation because the hypophysectomized rat furnished 
 the most conclusive test objects conceivable for replacement therapy the only final answer as to whether or not all the 
 essential chemical substances 0:sub 0:stances furnished by the gland have been captured in the extracts however he also clearly recognized 
 the importance of biochemical methods 0:meth 0:ods in 1933 he noted that although biological workers had been able to develop 
 sensitive tests to give a relative assurance of the validity of distinctions made among the various pituitary substances the ultimate 
 demonstration that the hormones were discrete entities awaited the methods of the biochemist in concentrating and purifying the extracts although 
 evans had great respect and hopes for the contributions of biochemists 0:bio 0:chemists in general one might also detect his 
 famous caustic wit at play in remarks that reveal something of his opinion of the broad sweep of collip s 
 endeavours fortunately the biological chemist has now joined forces with the biologist or in the example of professor collip has 
 taken charge of the whole affair and one will sympathize with the impulse that leads me to predict that through 
 the use of some of the most modern tools of biologic chemistry ultimate identification of these substances will not be 
 long delayed 33 later in 1937 evans continued to demonstrate a disdainful attitude towards collip when asked for his evaluation 
 of collip s group by a rockefeller official evans reportedly replied that he felt selye was gradually building up the 
 biology of the group but that collip was a brilliant potshotter 34 his attitudes perhaps reflect disciplinary jealousies 0:jealou 0:sies 
 and a concern that a biochemist had no business trying to do the work of the biologist as well his 
 potshotter comment however may have been a particularly apt critique of the overall structure of collip s research program collip 
 s intuitive and unsystematic method of making extractions and his restless urge to forge on to new territory when he 
 felt he had finished with the most interesting part of a problem 0:prob 0:lem meant that while he was able 
 to uncover much that was valuable he often did not see things through to full fruition thus the nature of 
 anterior pituitary hormone research forced collaboration 0:col 0:laboration between investigators from different disciplines while both the biochemist and the physiologist 
 or histologist recognized how essential 0:es 0:sential the other s methods were to their research work as individuals trained in 
 particular disciplines collip and evans tended to view the contributions from the other s discipline as valuable tools in the 
 pursuit of their own ventures the interdisciplinary relationship was sometimes 
 j b collip 104 uneasy but for the few leading laboratories in the field the keys to success 0:suc 0:cess 
 were the mastery of the technique of hypophysectomy the development 0:devel 0:opment of new supplies of research materials and the 
 bridging of disciplinary boundaries antihormone theory while working on the anterior pituitary collip and his co workers were launched into 
 a very different area of research when they followed 0:fol 0:lowed up some anomalous observations they found that when an 
 animal 0:ani 0:mal was treated with gonadotropic hormone for a prolonged period of time it would sometimes become resistant to 
 the effect of the hormone this resistance also occurred with long term doses of thyreotropic hormone 0:hor 0:mone collip had 
 already encountered this type of resistance in the use of parathyroid hormone in clinical treatment this phenomenon captured 0:cap 0:tured 
 his interest and he began to carry out further research on it in 1934 he discovered that when blood serum 
 taken from an animal that had become resistant to a particular hormone was injected into a normal 0:nor 0:mal animal 
 the second animal acquired resistance to the same substance 0:sub 0:stance even though it had not been exposed to the 
 hormone before this resistance was highly specific in that an animal that was made non responsive to gonadotropic hormone of 
 the pituitary would still respond to that of the placenta collip argued that there were two possible explanations for this 
 phenomenon 0:phe 0:nomenon first the inhibition might be due to an immunological reaction 0:reac 0:tion in which the injected hormone 
 extract was the antigen and the inhibitory substance in the blood was the antibody alternatively the inhibitory substance might be 
 a normal constituent of the blood that was produced in greater amounts in response to chronic exposure to injections he 
 favoured the latter explanation and introduced the concept 0:con 0:cept of antihormones speculating that many or all hormones might have 
 such an opposite an antihormone that inhibited its activity in a healthy individual amounts of a hormone and its antihormone 
 would be balanced a disease situation would occur when one of the components increased or decreased relative to the other 
 collip compared 0:com 0:pared the hormone antihormone system to a buffer system in which components of the blood were carefully 
 regulated by the balance of opposing 0:op 0:posing factors such a theory fit with contemporary ideas of the regulation 0:regula 
 0:tion of physiological processes the concept of buffer systems in blood chemistry was introduced by the physiologist l j henderson 
 from 1904 to 1912 and most fully elaborated during the 19205 his ideas of a regulatory equilibrium were very influential 
 and were extended to 
 the great years 1934 1941 105 other bodily processes such as temperature regulation and breathing rate by fellow harvard physiologist 
 walter b cannon cannon developed 0:devel 0:oped the term homeostasis to describe the maintenance of a dynamic equilibrium in physiological 
 processes 3s a substantial portion of the work of collip s laboratory after 1935 was devoted to the antihormone theory 
 collip and anderson prepared extracts of the sera of resistant animals and studied their antihormone properties with carl bachman and 
 selye he tested the resistance produced 0:pro 0:duced by pituitary gonadotropic hormone and apl among others in the field collip 
 was considered the father of antihormones the subject was highly popular for about twenty years becoming an area of study 
 for laboratory researchers as well as clinicians who observed their patients 0:pa 0:tients develop resistance during prolonged hormone treatment 36 
 the chief criticism of this antihormone theory was that resistance might simply be an immunological response that is the substances 
 attacking 0:at 0:tacking the hormone could be antibodies formed by the body s general defense system rather than pre existing 
 antihormones while collip acknowledged 0:ac 0:knowledged that the phenomenon he encountered may be regarded quite rightly as a possible antibody 
 reaction to the administered extract antigen he preferred to think that the antagonistic principles were normal constituents of the blood 
 he was encouraged in this belief by his observation that some human patients appeared to possess antihormones 0:antihor 0:mones to 
 thyreotropic hormone and gonadotrophic hormone even though they had never been treated with injections as well histological 0:histologi 0:cal studies 
 indicated that the resistance extended not only to the injected 0:in 0:jected hormone but also to the hormone produced by 
 the test animal s own pituitary 37 hans selye and the concept of stress hans selye s work began to 
 go off in a distinctly different direction selye as the youngest member of the lab had been set the task 
 of going to the slaughterhouse to collect buckets of cow ovaries he was then to take the extracts that collip 
 made from these ovaries inject them into female rats and examine their sex organs for any effects in the process 
 0:pro 0:cess he found a number of unexpected results in the injected animals enlarged adrenal glands atrophied lymphatic systems or 
 ulcers in the stomach and upper intestine selye decided to experiment with extracts made from other organs as well as 
 with toxic substances to his surprise these same changes occurred he then put some of his rats on the windy 
 roof of the building exposing them to the canadian winter and others onto motorized treadmills when both of these harsh 
 
 106 j b collip circumstances caused the same organic changes he postulated that in all these test cases the rats 
 were displaying a general alarm reaction or the syndrome of just being sick rather than a reaction to any specific 
 substance gradually selye began to formulate his theory of the general alarm syndrome this later became the stress theory for 
 which he would be famous in 1936 selye and collip produced a joint paper describing the interpretation of the action 
 of various stimuli on endocrine glands this study included a discussion of the alarm reaction produced by injections 0:injec 0:tions 
 of formaldehyde however selye s dogged pursuit of this line of research became a source of great friction between collip 
 and himself collip repeatedly tried to dissuade selye from following such an uncertain 0:uncer 0:tain course of research in his 
 memoirs selye recalled that his new idea had filled him with juvenile enthusiasm and he had been very hurt by 
 the tough criticism of his chief whom he respected and regarded as a fatherly friend when he saw me thus 
 launched on another enraptured description of what i observed in animals treated with this or that impure toxic material he 
 looked at me with desperately sad eyes and cried but selye try to realize what you are doing before it 
 is too late you have now decided to spend your entire life studying the meaningless side effects of disease i 
 am even tempted to look upon your work as the pharmacology of dirt 3b eventually the dispute between the two 
 men became insupportable selye left the department in 1938 and fortunately was able to find a new home in the 
 anatomy department this regrettable rift was due to both personal and intellectual factors on the personal level it was a 
 clash of two strong minded individuals selye was noted for his arrogance 0:arro 0:gance his strong commitment to a project 
 that collip found valueless was incompatible with the system that collip had established in his laboratory although lab members were 
 permitted a great deal of freedom 0:free 0:dom in pursuing their interests it was always collip who set the broader 
 questions and themes that they were to follow selye s theory was out of step with collip s research program 
 on an intellectual level selye was concerned with a general widespread non specific response while collip s work was devoted 
 to specificity collip focused on identifying distinct activities extracting and purifying the principles responsible 0:re 0:sponsible for them and then 
 precisely defining their chemical and physiological properties 39 in his concept of the alarm reaction selye took a very different 
 approach 0:ap 0:proach to explaining resistance or at least certain instances of resistance 0:resis 0:tance than collip had with his 
 antihormone theory selye explored 
 the great years 19 3 4 1 941 107 situations in which hormone resistance developed but no antihormone substance could 
 be demonstrated in the blood he found that this resistance 0:resis 0:tance was not very specific an animal rendered resistant 
 through treatment 0:treat 0:ment with estradiol for example was also resistant to the synthetic estrogen diethylstilbestrol he interpreted this as 
 evidence that the animal 0:ani 0:mal had developed a resistance not to the chemical substance itself but to the toxic 
 effect of the principle and that this resistance followed the pattern of general adaptation to any noxious stimulus he gradually 
 developed a theory of the general adaptation syndrome which he described 0:de 0:scribed as the sum of all non specific 
 systemic reactions of the body which ensue upon long continued exposure to stress and which are distinct from specific adaptive 
 reactions such as the development of muscles upon physical exercise or allergic and immunological reactions to foreign agents 40 collip 
 was committed to his antihormone theory but was careful to maintain that it was a working hypothesis in 1938 he 
 acknowledged that true antibodies were doubtless formed and that the question of whether antihormones were also present could only be 
 decided after much more experimental work in his final article on the subject in 1941 collip with selye and thomson 
 discussed the large body of literature that had provided evidence both for and against the antihormone theory one of the 
 issues emphasized in the article was the importance of the factor 0:fac 0:tor of species specificity three different animals from 
 three different species 0:spe 0:cies could be involved in such experiments the animal from which the original extract was taken 
 the one into which the extract was injected and the final animal that received the serum of the second 41 
 herbert evans was highly sceptical about the existence of antihormones 0:antihor 0:mones especially because his own studies with growth hormone 
 had shown that as the hormone preparations were purified they were less likely to cause the type of response associated 
 with antihormones during 0:dur 0:ing a discussion of a paper about antihormone therapy at the 1948 laurentian 0:lau 0:rentian hormone 
 conference evans offered these sarcastic remarks no more brilliant observation has ever been made in the history of experimental 0:experimen 
 0:tal biology than that of collip and anderson who observed that animals treated chronically with such anterior hypophyseal preparations as 
 were then available failed to provide continuous physiological stimulation although their extracts were active in fresh animals my cheeks however 
 are lined with creases to the depth of the grand canyon as our colleagues employed the term antihormone for the 
 phenomenon of refractoriness and they will be credited forever in the world s history of accurate knowledge for this term 
 a refractory phase will almost inevitably ensue with impure preparations but will disappear will melt like ice in the sun 
 with purification of the material in question 42 
 j b collip 108 later endocrine scientist roy greep suggested that the idea of antihormones 0:anti 0:hormones caught the fancy 
 of researchers and mushroomed this ideological balloon did not burst when punctured by fact but deflated ever so slowly during 
 the next fifteen years as opposing evidence built up the idea of antihormones gradually lost out to the theory that 
 resistance was due to an immunological reaction robert noble and david thomson rationalized however that one legacy of the antihormone 
 0:antihor 0:mone theory was that it successfully raised the question of species specificity 0:spec 0:ificity in the use of protein 
 hormones in therapeutic procedures 43 ongoing studies of the parathyroid hormone the study of the parathyroid hormone and its physiological 
 activities continued to interest collip he and his associates made significant contributions to the understanding of the manner in which 
 this hormone 0:hor 0:mone acted theodore schwartz provides an account of a friendly intellectual 0:intel 0:lectual contest between collip and 
 fuller albright in the mid 1930s and early 1940s over the question of how the hormone acted to control calcium 
 metabolism collip argued that the hormone acted on the bone while albright argued that it acted on the kidneys this 
 contest continued for some time up until 194z when after performing an experiment 0:ex 0:periment collip and abe neufeld were 
 forced to admit that albright was correct in saying the hormone acted on the kidneys albright agreed with the conclusion 
 but disagreed that collip s experiment had proven the point ironically some time later albright turned around and conceded that 
 the hormone acted on the bone schwartz calls collip and albright giants with tunnel vision because they insisted on a 
 single action for the hormone he attributes this tendency to the intuitive parsimonious appeal of the idea that a hormone 
 would act on only one target organ in analogy to the action of insulin on blood glucose albright s associate 
 read ellsworth not emotionally bound to either stance finally recognized that the two positions were unnecessarily 0:un 0:necessarily polarized that 
 in fact the parathyroid hormone acted at both sites 44 albright also expressed interest in collip s idea of antihormones 
 and wrote to collip when he began encountering resistance to parathyroid hormone in a patient who had never received parathyroid 
 treatment before in his reply collip suggested a method for testing antiparathyroid 0:antiparathy 0:roid substance in the serum of the 
 patient albright later rejected the antihormone explanation for this phenomenon and developed the theory of end organ resistance for pseudohypoparathyroidism 
 this theory held that while many of the symptoms of this condition were like those 
 the great years 1934 1941 109 of normal hypoparathyroidism the patients failed to react to parathyroid 0:parathy 0:roid injections not 
 because of acquired resistance but because their receptor organs were constitutionally unable to respond christiane sinding has examined the development 
 of albright s theory and his rejection 0:re 0:jection of collip s idea of antihormones 4s collip s great years 
 began to ebb towards the end of the decade david thomson s teaching responsibilities grew ever larger evelyn anderson returned 
 to berkeley the nature of the department s experimental 0:experi 0:mental work changed after selye s departure in 1938 even 
 though selye continued to help with histological reports greater emphasis was put on studying those pituitary factors that caused changes 
 that could be evaluated through physiological measurements such as oxygen consumption 0:con 0:sumption and blood sugar level rather than those 
 that required histological 0:histo 0:logical study for example collip and abe neufeld studied the effects of pituitary extracts on fat 
 and carbohydrate metabolism collip continued to work with a large group of students and associates 0:associ 0:ates and together they 
 explored a wide variety of topics such as the prolactin and diabetogenic activities of the anterior pituitary and the effects 
 of testosterone adrenaline and estrin one less successful venture 0:ven 0:ture was a pituitary extract that collip named no 622 
 after his family s new home on 622 sydenham avenue in westmount with abe neufeld and orville denstedt he studied 
 its effect in stimulating metabolism 0:me 0:tabolism when volunteers in the lab took it by oral administration they reported that 
 it gave rise to feelings of vigour and well being with i m rabinowitch at the montreal general hospital collip 
 and his coworkers 0:co 0:workers conducted clinical trials of 622 in the hope that it might have uses in the 
 treatment of obesity or in cases where an increase in metabolism was desirable the existence of this substance was never 
 clearly demonstrated however and clinical trials failed to reveal any activity that could be attributed to it 46 the war 
 upon canada s entrance into the second world war in 1939 many medical 0:med 0:ical researchers across the country began 
 to direct their research activities to supporting the war effort collip and his lab were no exception with robert noble 
 collip examined the problem of shock and the production 0:produc 0:tion of mammary tumours upon treatment with diethylstilbestrol and other 
 forms of estrogen the research on shock was of particular importance 0:impor 0:tance in wartime noble and collip experimented with 
 a number of ways of producing trauma in rats such as crushing or freezing their extremities 0:ex 0:tremities they finally 
 developed a revolving upright circular drum known as the noble collip drum in which they spun rats the rats 
 j b collip 110 were traumatized carried upward and then dropped as the drum turned but did not suffer obvious 
 hemorrhages or fractures the amount of trauma could be quantified by regulating the time the rats were subjected to the 
 treatment the noble collip drum was picked up by other researchers 0:re 0:searchers but caused outrage among antivivisectionists 47 after 
 1 94 1 collip s research productivity dropped off dramatically he became increasingly involved in wartime administrative work with the 
 medical research arm of the national research council and had to spend much of his time travelling between montreal ottawa 
 and washington during the years he was away from the laboratory he was increasingly left behind by the continued advances 
 in knowledge and laboratory technique his old rival herbert evans along with choh hao li and miriam simpson achieved some 
 of the most important successes during this period a purified acth in 1943 growth hormone in 1944 and folliclestimulating 0:follicle 
 0:stimulating hormone fsh in 1949 evans continued to collaborate successfully 0:suc 0:cessfully with skilled biochemists in reference to the isolation 
 of the adrenocorticotrophic hormone he said in order to establish the biological 0:bio 0:logical characteristic of a hormone from a 
 complex source such as the pituitary it must first be isolated in pure form judged both by chemical and biological 
 data he emphasized the importance of the interplay of chemical and biological methods in the purification of growth hormone one 
 of the keys to the success of evans and his collaborators was the development 0:de 0:velopment of a very sensitive 
 bioassay that involved examining the thickness 0:thick 0:ness of the epiphysial plate of the tibia of young hypophysectomized rats a 
 tissue that was very responsive to growth hormone 48 despite the rift with selye collip and thomson continued to write 
 review papers with him and to ask for his services in making histological examinations selye however was becoming more and 
 more occupied with his general adaptation theory without selye as a member of his team collip did not have ready 
 access to the innovative work in anatomy and histology that the evans group used to great effect another factor in 
 the decline of collip s work was the advent of new techniques in biochemistry his colleague robert noble explained that 
 during the war collip s field of protein extraction changed dramatically 0:dramati 0:cally his familiar techniques had given way to 
 strange technical and mechanical methods of separation enabling isolation identification and even synthesis of polypeptide chains 49 among these new 
 techniques 0:tech 0:niques were electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation both of which were used by the groups led by evans at berkeley 
 and hugh long at yale in 1943 in isolating acth these methods utilized physical properties 0:prop 0:erties of the component 
 molecules to separate them mechanically and to demonstrate that the final products were homogeneous they allowed 0:al 
 the great years 1934 1941 111 lowed evans and long to go beyond the crude extract of adrenocorticotropic 0:adrenocorti 0:cotropic 
 hormone that collip and anderson had prepared in 1933 the equipment used by the berkeley and yale researchers was not 
 readily available to canadians until some time later the electrophoresis 0:electrophore 0:sis technique was introduced by arne wilhelm kaurin tiselius 
 of the university of uppsala in 1937 the first electrophoresis instruments in canada were installed at dalhousie and alberta about 
 1948 and at the national research council in 1950 the ultracentrifuge had been developed 0:de 0:veloped by svedberg in 1924 
 but few actual examples of it existed for many years after as it was a huge machine driven by an 
 oil turbine and requiring two floors of space a more compact analytical ultracentrifuge 0:ultracentri 0:fuge was first installed in canada 
 in 1949 at the national research council at the cost of 20 000 collip did not use any of these 
 methods 0:meth 0:ods in his scientific work perhaps because he did not have ready access to the equipment since collip 
 was by that date head of the national research council medical research committee later division it seems likely that he 
 could have availed himself of the opportunity had he felt it important more likely his administrative work had taken him 
 away from the bench for so long that he chose not to tackle learning these new methods recognizing how difficult 
 it would be for him to return to the forefront of research everything was good fun the hectic decade of 
 the 1930s saw the peak of collip s research career he had been the head of a large thriving laboratory 
 group and on the cutting edge of one of the most exciting fields of research he was later to look 
 back upon this period with a fondness rivalling that for his insulin 0:in 0:sulin days in 1964 herbert evans asked 
 him to prepare a statement for a publication on the endocrines asking him to recall what researches had given him 
 the most fun collip replied as far as fun is concerned that on a certain time in january 1922 at 
 about midnight when i found that i could trap insulin in 80 95 alcohol i nearly went crazy with joy 
 naturally as you have guessed i got a great kick out of my work on the parathyroid 1924 26 and 
 of the pituitary work at mcgill in the 30 s i think i would have to put acth first although 
 for about 10 years everything 0:ev 0:erything was good fun sl he had achieved this productivity by successfully making the 
 transition 0:transi 0:tion from working as an individual to heading a large team of investigators 0:investi 0:gators moreover the team 
 was particularly successful when it was anchored by the ideal configuration of collip and selye with their 
 j b collip 112 complementary skills in biochemistry and histology collip was most happy at the centre of his laboratory 
 fractionating a continuous stream of hormones that his associates were set to test collip s problems arose when this pattern 
 of activity broke down he gave his co workers a great deal of freedom in determining their projects in fact 
 his critics have suggested that collip s group was too ambitious in pursuing a broad range of topics and not 
 sufficiently thorough 0:thor 0:ough in following them through that they tried to cover too much ground in too little time 
 5 collip however could not brook the extreme 0:ex 0:treme challenge posed by selye to his research program selye s 
 subsequent 0:subse 0:quent departure was a grave loss to collip s work while collip made important contributions to physiological theory 
 such as his conclusions about the mechanism of the action of the parathyroid hormone his most significant achievements were in 
 manipulative 0:ma 0:nipulative biochemistry rather than in theory he was at his best when pulling out thyreotrophic hormone and adrenotrophic 
 hormone as he had been with insulin and parathyroid hormone he was less successful when he ventured into the conceptual 
 realm as with the antihormone theory beginning in the 19405 the field of protein chemistry began to change dramatically the 
 new instruments and methods were a far cry from those used in collip s intuitive bathtub style of chemistry the 
 methods that had brought him so much success for decades were now being overtaken by the techniques developed by a 
 new generation 
 6 the private funding of research 1928 1947 patents grants and institutes i do not wish to enlarge my staff 
 to any appreciable extent but i should like to be able to keep my workers together 1 j b collip 
 to c f martin 15 december 1934 scientific knowledge is a product not only of experiments and ideas but also 
 of institutions and financial resources during the period he was at mcgill collip had a distinct vision for his research 
 enterprise and was continually engaged in negotiations with parties both inside and outside 0:out 0:side the university to make this 
 dream a reality in the mid to late 19305 one of collip s prime concerns was to ensure the financial 
 stability 0:sta 0:bility of his laboratory group to this end he and charles martin made a bid to the rockefeller 
 foundation for a research grant collip was also engaged in a series of discussions with mcgill university officials to further 
 his goal of gaining greater status stability and the freedom to concentrate on his research during the 19305 there was 
 no large scale systematic governmental funding of medical research in canada the national research council of canada nrc directed fellowships 
 and grants only towards work in the physical sciences a notable exception to this pattern was the nrc support of 
 tuberculosis research during the 1920s and 19305 experimental 0:experi 0:mental work in the medical sciences was largely carried out in 
 academic settings there research work was supported primarily by general university 0:univer 0:sity funds provided by the provincial governments mcgill 
 and the university 0:uni 0:versity of toronto were the leading universities in the country and the only two institutions to 
 offer fully developed doctoral programs until after 0:af 0:ter the second world war mcgill differed from toronto in that it 
 derived 0:de 0:rived the bulk of its funding from private sources because of this mcgill was much more dependent upon 
 the bounty of the business community 0:com 0:munity wealthy alumni and philanthropic foundations particularly the 
 j b collip 114 rockefeller foundation and the carnegie foundation the banting research 0:re 0:search foundation established in 1925 as 
 a legacy of the insulin discovery 0:discov 0:ery was one of the few canadian sources of medical research funds 1 
 from the mid i93os to the early 19405 the mcgill administration underwent a period of instability running through a rapid 
 succession of principals sir arthur currie the university s hero principal died of pneumonia in november of 1933 mcgill s 
 chancellor edward wentworth 0:went 0:worth beatty took over as acting principal for over a year until a successor 0:suc 0:cessor 
 was named in june 1935 beatty past president of the canadian pacific railway had been a strong and active chancellor 
 he had been a dominant figure at the university even during currie s term as principal 0:prin 0:cipal and especially 
 during curries extended absences illness and in the final years of his life after curries death beatty exercised what mcgill 
 historian stanley frost calls his own brand of benevolent dictatorship 0:dic 0:tatorship until the end of the decade 3 after 
 the first world war mcgill s faculty of medicine was systematically 0:system 0:atically revitalized and its research facilities expanded the 
 medical institutions 0:in 0:stitutions created out of this reform were strongly oriented towards scientific research and to the close association 
 of basic science and clinical 0:clin 0:ical science one of the most notable developments was the establishment 0:establish 0:ment of 
 the university medical clinic in conjunction with the royal victoria hospital in 1924 jonathan meakins s great achievement there was 
 to bring the basic sciences and the spirit of scientific inquiry to clinical medicine the clinic became home to an 
 active group of researchers 0:re 0:searchers in the basic and clinical sciences the montreal neurological institute was another notable institution 
 created around this time when wilder penfield the renowned neurosurgeon was invited to mcgill in 1928 as professor of neurology 
 and neurosurgery he proposed 0:pro 0:posed the establishment of an institute that would serve as a clinical hospital and a 
 research facility such an institute was completed in 1934 built with the aid of 1 282 652 from the rockefeller 
 foundation 0:founda 0:tion 400 000 from the quebec government 300 000 from the city of montreal and 125 000 from 
 various research funds within the university 0:uni 0:versity the montreal neurological institute gained an international reputation for its achievement in 
 research and treatment the third accomplishment 0:ac 0:complishment was the creation of the pathological institute in 1924 in collaboration with 
 the royal victoria hospital and under the direction of horst oertel this institute housed the mcgill pathology and bacteriology 0:bacte 
 0:riology departments provided pathological and bacteriological services to the hospital and served as a centre of clinical studies 4 in 
 appointing collip martin was adding another distinguished medical scientist to his faculty and thus furthering mcgill s research reputation collip 
 proved his worth by greatly expanding the research 
 the private funding of research 1928 1947 115 program of the department of biochemistry as we have seen through the 
 19305 he headed a large and energetic group of investigators who produced a remarkable stream of papers in endocrinology warren 
 weaver of the rockefeller foundation observed members of this department 0:de 0:partment constitute a very unusual group in intelligence enthusiasm 
 and loyalty to their chief investigators come here from canada the states and england and apparently they all want to 
 stay on indefinitely s 0:indefi 0:nitely s the size and energy of collip s group were a credit to his 
 skill as a leader and a scientist but the responsibility of supporting a large number of staff proved to be 
 a heavy burden when collip first arrived at mcgill in 1928 the departmental budget 0:bud 0:get was 21 000 in 
 just six years he managed to more than double that figure to 51 500 a large portion of the budget 
 came from general 0:gen 0:eral university funds but cutbacks in university finances since the start of the depression had reduced 
 this amount from 26 000 to 18 000 or from over half of the total departmental expenditures to just onethird 
 0:one 0:third collip was obliged to raise the remainder of the departmental funds from outside sources for collip the most 
 significant source of research funds throughout his career was the insulin royalties as beneficiaries 0:bene 0:ficiaries of the insulin royalties 
 he banting and best shared in what michael bliss argues was probably the largest pool of canadian capital 0:capi 0:tal 
 supporting medical research until the second world war a fact that put these three in financial positions rivalled by few 
 other medical scientists in the country from 1930 to 1935 collip s portion of the royalties increased steadily from 20 
 000 to 30 000 per annum at mcgill only the university clinic and the neurological institute had the same degree 
 of stable funding the university clinic endowment provided an annual income of 24 000 and the neurological institute endowment yielded 
 40 000 in later years collip also collected royalties from the other products he developed emmenin royalties amounted to only 
 one or two thousand dollars annually in the first few years of its commercial life but once ayerst moved into 
 the american market sales jumped dramatically by 1939 mcgill was receiving 22 000 a year sales of emmenin dropped after 
 1940 owing to competition from synthetic forms of estrogen but ayerst then developed the highly successful premarin a natural estrogen 
 that like emmenin was orally active ayerst advertised collip s name on its labels and used the services of his 
 laboratory for the standardization of this new product although collip had not been directly involved in the development of premarin 
 ayerst paid him a 2 per cent royalty perhaps 0:per 0:haps in recognition of the credibility the product gained through 
 its association 0:asso 0:ciation with his name and perhaps in gratitude for the success his collaboration had brought them this 
 proved to be no small token by 
 j b collip 116 1947 premarin royalties brought in over 50 000 per year royalties from pituitrin also produced by 
 ayerst provided another few thousand dollars a year collip concerned for the long term stability of his finances 0:fi 0:nances 
 had the funds from these royalties capitalized in order to build up a substantial endowment 7 short term grants from 
 individual benefactors had a less significant place in the departmental budget these donations were usually made only for a period 
 of one or two years providing an additional 5 000 to 10 000 for research they offered none of the 
 security of the other sources of income and were dependent upon collip s skill in cultivating the friendship and support 
 of such leading canadian philanthropists as vincent massey and samuel bronfman 8 vincent massey was the grandson of hart massey 
 founder of massey harris the leading manufacturer of agricultural machinery as chairman of the massey foundation created out of hart 
 s estate vincent 0:vin 0:cent effectively controlled the many large benefactions made by the foundation massey s younger son hart 
 had had an operation at the age of six that had affected his pituitary gland the result was that at 
 the age of sixteen he remained very small massey consulted a wide group of medical experts including collip and selye 
 about his son s endocrine problem the famous neurosurgeon harvey cushing operated 0:oper 0:ated on hart as well very impressed 
 by what they had heard of collip s 0:col 0:lip 0:s research work and by what they had seen in 
 his laboratories massey and his wife made several annual grants of 5 000 from the massey foundation to collip s 
 work starting in 1933 9 the rockefeller foundation bid the funding collected from these various sources was sufficient to carry 
 collip s department through its most active phase of research in the 19305 by mid decade however a number of 
 concerns began to weigh heavily on collip first the physical facilities for his team s work were stretched to the 
 limit the biochemistry department was located with the other biological science departments in the new biological building that had been 
 completed with rockefeller money in 19z2 when it was first constructed the building had been a celebrated example of the 
 latest 0:lat 0:est in laboratory design but by the mid 19 30s the laboratory space and animal care facilities proved 
 inadequate for collip s rapidly expanding research group second collip faced the probable loss of his insulin royalties the insulin 
 patents the single largest source of his research monies were due to expire in 1940 in his desire to ensure 
 the continuation 0:continu 0:ation of the work of his group beyond the 1940 deadline collip turned to the rockefeller foundation 
 which had so handsomely endowed the 
 the private funding of research 192 8 1947 117 neurological institute and many other medical facilities at mcgill his vision 
 for his research group is revealed in his application to the foundation during the 19zos the rockefeller foundation made a 
 series of large grants to the building program of mcgill s medical faculty from 1925 to 1928 the foundation s 
 administrative structure underwent a major reorganization 0:re 0:organization that produced a significant change in its granting policy the foundation s 
 various divisions were realigned in order to consolidate their activities and to rein in some of the more powerful boards 
 the restructuring shifted the foundation s focus from medicine and public health which had been its traditional areas of strength 
 towards a greater emphasis on science five divisions were created the international 0:interna 0:tional health division which was responsible for 
 public health and divisions for natural sciences medical sciences social sciences and humanities 0:hu 0:manities because the great depression made 
 large and long term projects too expensive the foundation changed its emphasis from large grants for institution building to small 
 short term grants for individual projects and to systematic support for work in specific fields designated by foundation officers this 
 new system was carried out by professional philanthropic staff members who have been described by historian robert 0:rob 0:ert kohler 
 as activist programme managers these officers were sufficiently 0:suffi 0:ciently well versed in their fields to select particular lines of 
 research for concentration and to make judgments about individual applications in december 1933 warren weaver head of the foundation s 
 natural sciences 0:sci 0:ences division and alan gregg head of the medical sciences division formulated a joint program called psychobiology 
 psychobiology encompassed 0:en 0:compassed psychiatry and the sciences underlying human behaviour in addition to psychiatry psychology and neurophysiology this program 
 included the sub fields of nutrition radiation sex physiology embryology 0:embryol 0:ogy genetics general physiology biophysics and biochemistry and internal 
 0:inter 0:nal secretions weaver was responsible for basic research in each of these areas and gregg looked after the clinical 
 portion 10 collip had had his first contact with the rockefeller foundation when he had received his travelling fellowship 1921 
 it was during the term of this award that he had travelled to toronto and had embarked on the work 
 on insulin as early as 1929 collip s program at mcgill was being considered for research aid by the officers 
 of the foundation collip was well thought of by a number of rockefeller managers r m pearce then head of 
 the medical sciences division remarked in 1929 collip is an excellent man he is really a biochemist and one of 
 the best and i may add that as a result of my first contact with him nine years ago when 
 he was at the university of alberta he received one of our fellowships 11 
 118 j b collip in 1934 collip and martin began to formulate a bid to the natural sciences division headed 
 by warren weaver the frank entries that weaver and other foundation officers made in their diaries reveal their perceptions of 
 collip s application weaver first visited collip at mcgill in february 1934 and in his report to his assistant director 
 frank blair hanson he expressed his approval of what he saw of collip and his staff hanson noted ww weaver 
 is very favourably impressed by c collip by the program of his group and by the intelligence and industry of 
 all the staff c has collected and attracted a really remarkable crowd of young people all of whom seem quite 
 on fire with enthusiasm the laboratory is going full steam from early morning until midnight and later 12 during weaver 
 s meeting with collip collip explained to him that his ultimate objective was the creation of an institute of endocrinology 
 either in a separate building or in the biological building where he was then located he suggested that this had 
 been one of the plans that sir arthur currie had hoped to put into effect before his death in 1933 
 collip was most intensely concerned however about difficulties maintaining 0:main 0:taining the financial support of his group there was so 
 little stability in his budget he noted and he did not wish to spend so much of his own time 
 soliciting funds year by year weaver was impressed that collip did not have any grandiose ideas for expansion noting that 
 collip had said he would be exceedingly happy just to have his situation stabilized at or near its existing level 
 collip s idea of establishing a separate institute 0:insti 0:tute derived from his long cherished wish to devote himself entirely 
 to his research work away from the teaching and administrative responsibilities 0:responsi 0:bilities entailed in chairing a university department only 
 a few models for this type of institute existed in canada the most significant being the banting and best department 
 of medical research at the university of toronto which had grown out of a research chair created for frederick 0:fred 
 0:erick banting in 1923 megilps neurological institute and pathological institute a short distance up mount royal from collip s home 
 in the biological building were other examples of research institutes but in these places original research was closely associated with 
 clinical treatment 13 since weaver was a mathematical physicist he sought the advice of others when it came to matters 
 relating to biomedical science soon after 0:af 0:ter his visit to montreal he consulted with two of collip s peers 
 in the field both of them active in the study of anterior pituitary hormones philip smith at berkeley and earl 
 theron engle at columbia while smith and engle told weaver that they recognized that collip was a very important investigator 
 weaver noted in his diary their comments to the effect that collip had tried to cover too much ground and 
 that 
 the private funding of research 192 8 1947 119 his work has been somewhat too hurried this criticism was later 
 shared by others and it proved to be of key importance in determining the fate of the grant application l 
 4 martin and collip were very stimulated by weaver s visit and asked for a further interview with him at 
 his office the following month when they were to be in new york for a conference and lectures at that 
 meeting weaver martin and collip discussed in general terms the levels 0:lev 0:els at which the foundation might consider supporting 
 collip s work at the lowest level of commitment the foundation could simply provide 0:pro 0:vide assistance for individual projects 
 more generously the foundation might provide some help to stabilize the departmental budget at a higher level yet the foundation 
 might provide both budget stabilization and some funds for basic equipment finally and ideally the rockefeller 0:rock 0:efeller foundation could 
 construct and endow new quarters for the group consisting of a new wing to the building or perhaps a small 
 building for the institute they agreed that no plans would go further until the fall when the university would have 
 developed a more definite 0:defi 0:nite plan with financial estimates 15 in december of 1934 martin returned to new york 
 and submitted a more detailed application this time he met with alan gregg the head of the medical sciences division 
 to discuss the clinical aspects of the work weaver laid up in the hospital for six weeks was unable to 
 meet with him martin brought along a memorandum in which collip articulated 0:artic 0:ulated his dreams for his group it 
 is my wish that my department should develop into an endocrine research institute 0:in 0:stitute endocrinology is an exceedingly broad 
 and comprehensive subject and in order that it may advance as a whole it follows that advances must be made 
 simultaneously in many of its various subdivisions probably nowhere else in the world is there a more advantageous setting for 
 endocrine research than here at mcgill with the department of biochemistry as the nucleus here under one roof divergent phases 
 of the subject are being studied 16 perhaps aware of the criticisms made against his broadly based program 0:pro 0:gram 
 collip added the list of our activities may at first sight suggest 0:sug 0:gest that we are undertaking too ambitious 
 a program my answer to such criticism would be simply this that we have been carrying on in this way 
 for a number of years and all we ask is that we be allowed to continue in our work again 
 collip emphasized that his main concern 0:con 0:cern was for stability rather than for expansion i do not wish to 
 enlarge my staff to any appreciable extent but i should like to be able to keep my workers together this 
 will involve a much greater salary 
 j b collip 120 budget for the future our working quarters are far from adequate and they should be at 
 least doubled the present staff could make use of more space and equipment and the output of work would be 
 increased we are particularly badly off as regards the proper housing etc of our experimental animals and certain very important 
 types of work which we are otherwise fully equipped to do cannot be done on account of this 17 he 
 emphasized his department s favourable situation specifically its friendly relations with various hospitals so that he and his group could 
 learn of endocrine cases of special interest perhaps playing to weaver s interest in supporting investigations related to human behaviour 
 collip added that he felt there was particular opportunity for applying laboratory 0:labora 0:tory studies to psychiatric cases and behavioural 
 problems he added that the department was organized so that there is continual dovetailing 0:dovetail 0:ing and interlacing of all 
 the experimental work thanks to the relationship 0:rela 0:tionship the individual workers had with him and to various lateral working 
 arrangements he established from time to time 18 upon returning to montreal martin wrote gregg asking him to visit montreal 
 to see the clinical end of the work as well as the neurological institute that gregg s division had been 
 responsible for building when this invitation was not accepted collip and martin made a return visit to new york in 
 march 1935 to see weaver and gregg this time they were accompanied by hector mortimer a physician who was working 
 in collip s laboratory on a voluntary basis collip had hoped to provide 0:pro 0:vide mortimer with some support for 
 his studies this member of the party proved not to be an asset however warren weaver reported on the meeting 
 in his diary an unfortunate proportion of the available time taken up by mortimer s elaborate and somewhat glib presentation 
 of his conception of the field of endocrinology and its applications it is not clear whether mortimer is present as 
 a chosen and effective spokesman 0:spokes 0:man or because out of concern for his own future he may have insisted 
 0:in 0:sisted upon his inclusion l 9 following mortimer s presentation martin broached the subject of the funds that were 
 being requested suggesting that approximately 200 000 would be required to remodel modernize and fireproof the old portion of the 
 biological building for the use of collip s department 0:depart 0:ment gregg made it clear that such a sum was 
 not likely to be forthcoming 0:forth 0:coming at that time weaver noted of the discussion somewhat vague presentation of requirements 
 for the research program in endocrinology 0:endocrinol 0:ogy the vagueness apparently having its origin in the fact that martin would 
 like to ask for as much as there is any possible chance of his getting 0:get 0:ting and therefore does 
 not wish to expose his hand until the foundation 0:founda 
 the private funding of research 1928 1947 121 tion shall have given him some indication lacking this indication the information 
 is not very definite or satisfactory 10 indeed two subjects appear to have been up for discussion first the request 
 for support for the research program that was in place with some possible additions and second the issue of how 
 to replace the income 0:in 0:come derived from the insulin patents weaver again noted the vagueness 0:vague 0:ness of the 
 mcgill delegation in this latter matter the group appears not to know just when this insulin income will cease through 
 expiration 0:expira 0:tion of the patents his general sense after the meeting was that only interim assistance could be considered 
 for the time being and that this would be for the most pressing needs such as space for animals he 
 noted in conclusion the interview is not a very satisfactory one collip 0:col 0:lip the substantial member of the group 
 gets relatively little opportunity 0:opportu 0:nity to express his ideas alan gregg added in his own diary i am dubious 
 as to the credibility of mortimer but collip s work is important 0:impor 0:tant and deserves some sort of aid 
 zi in order to gain a better sense of the potential costs involved in creating 0:creat 0:ing additional space in 
 the biological building martin asked the superintendent 0:super 0:intendent engineer at mcgill to draw up an estimate the existing building 
 was in the shape of an i the northern wing of which was the portion of the old medical building 
 that had been spared from the fire of 1907 the central and southern portions of the building were the sections 
 built in 1922 the biochemistry department which occupied 0:occu 0:pied the third floor of the new section had offices research 
 and teaching 0:teach 0:ing laboratories a library and storerooms the engineering report made it clear that it was not feasible 
 to reconstruct the old part of the biological building and proposed instead various schemes to add a new storey over 
 the existing building the estimates for which ranged from 19 000 to 73 000 these plans included new rooms and 
 accommodations 0:ac 0:commodations for the rat colony and the monkeys 11 hoping that the application could be considered by the 
 foundation trustees at their spring meeting martin wrote to weaver to follow up on their most recent interview he argued 
 professor collip and his associates 0:as 0:sociates have already made a number of outstanding contributions and his recent discoveries which 
 seem most important of all give promise of greater achievement he is at the most productive period of his life 
 and should be vigorous and active for at least fifteen to twenty years this is the time he most of 
 all needs every possible facility l 3 this time martin considerably scaled down the ambitious figure of 200 000 that 
 he had suggested at the earlier meeting he proposed an alternative construction scheme that could be carried out for 60 
 000 and suggested that it should satisfy collip s needs for many years to 
 j b collip 122 come martin asked that the foundation provide 40 000 of this sum and offered to raise 
 the rest of the amount from other sources in addition 0:addi 0:tion he asked for an annual sum of 20 
 000 for four years for personnel 0:person 0:nel and supplies this sum was not to be used to provide any 
 additional appointments to the staff but only to help pay for technical assistance apparatus supplies and animals collip argued that 
 this amount would simply allow his existing staff to work at maximum efficiency and that it would increase their productivity 
 considerably martin acknowledged 0:acknowl 0:edged the fact that the insulin royalties were due to expire soon but insisted 0:in 0:sisted 
 that collip would carry on his work after that even on a skeleton budget if he had to on the 
 other hand he ventured we feel that by that time his results will be such as to stimulate further interest 
 0:in 0:terest in his work both at home and abroad l 4 in new york weaver was not impressed by 
 this presentation he found it lacking in that it did not contain an explicit statement of the department s financial 
 situation in his diary he noted that it seemed clear that martin should be able and be required to indicate 
 in full detail 0:de 0:tail the sources of present and future income for support of collip s work in the 
 absence of an entirely clear picture of this phase of things i see no reason for aid from rf in 
 a reply to martin weaver asked for further details of the budget of the department where the income came from 
 and what proportion of it the foundation money was to replace 0:re 0:place details of plans and estimates for remodelling 
 so that it is clear that 60 000 will accomplish a result which is really satisfactory from the scientific point 
 of view most critically he asked is it wise to expand considerably with the knowledge that the insulin income will 
 decrease or drop out in 1939 he dashed martin s hope that the application would be considered that spring and 
 indicated that it could not be reviewed until the fall 2 5 this came as a blow to collip and 
 martin collip commented to a friend and former colleague university of alberta zoologist william rowan i have had rather a 
 serious disappointment in regard to securing 0:secur 0:ing extra money for expanding the work i hope that this is only 
 a temporary 0:tem 0:porary setback but in these day one cannot be sure of anything unless he has the money 
 in hand z6 at the end of august martin tried again he wrote to weaver saying that he and collip 
 were very anxious to have another opportunity to discuss the matter he added that work had been going well during 
 the summer and some very interesting new light has been thrown on a number of new problems another meeting was 
 arranged but it too failed to achieve the desired outcome weaver wrote in his diary afterwards 0:after 0:wards that before 
 collip s arrival martin had made a characteristically 0:characteristi 0:cally silly inquiry as to whether he has offended some officer 
 of the 
 the private funding of research 19z8 1947 123 foundation his sensitivity apparently arising from the fact that we are not 
 rushing through his requests on his own schedule martin tried to impress on weaver the poor financial situation at mcgill 
 the university 0:univer 0:sity had been running a 250 000 deficit and by strenuous measures had reduced this to about 
 100 000 martin mentioned a recent large bequest to the medical school he was perhaps referring to one from the 
 william g cheney estate that had already produced 50 000 and was expected to produce some 30 000 or 3 
 5 000 more for work in medicine 0:medi 0:cine martin had hoped to use a fair portion of this money 
 for collip s building program but the board of governors had decided to use only the income and not touch 
 the principal when weaver inquired about whether other funds from private sources might be anticipated he noted that neither martin 
 nor collip appeared to welcome the question and that both are a little vague in their general indication that no 
 further 0:fur 0:ther money is in sight l 7 in terms of detailed financial information the mcgill delegation came to 
 this meeting better prepared than before martin presented weaver with an official statement of the income and expenditures for the 
 department for the year 1934 35 along with five sheets showing the details of the salaries and wages of the 
 staff weaver scrupulous in his observations quickly noted that the totals for the salaries did not match on the two 
 different statements collip tried to remedy the gaff by explaining that the accounting process by which the salaries were assigned 
 to the various sources of income was a wholly artificial process 0:pro 0:cess he went through the list of salaries 
 quickly marking t s and p s next to the names of those he considered to be temporary or permanent 
 members of the staff trying to regain his footing collip moved the discussion on to the larger question of his 
 two main goals the first was to give his present staff satisfactory accommodation the second was to replace the income 
 then gained from one time private donations about 10 000 and after july 1940 to replace the income from the 
 insulin royalties collip stated dramatically that if he could not obtain some pledge of outside assistance for the years after 
 1940 he would immediately begin to cut his staff and accumulate a reserve from the insulin income 28 when the 
 pair returned to montreal martin quickly tried to further repair their blunder by sending corrected salary figures to weaver with 
 an explanation of the discrepancy between the two sets of figures they had presented this was to no avail ten 
 days after the interview weaver responded with a clear no he explained that the foundation was unwilling to contribute the 
 funds requested to maintain a level of expenditure that would only have to be reduced when the insulin patents 0:pat 
 0:ents ended he emphasized that he was not prejudging whether or not 
 j b collip 124 the foundation would be willing to replace the insulin income after 1940 but only that it 
 was impossible for him to make such a pledge at that time he suggested grimly that they would be well 
 advised to reduce 0:re 0:duce the budget of the department he concluded it therefore seems to me that this is 
 an inappropriate moment to consider support of the budget of the department he offered only this were the university in 
 a position to assure the replacement of the insulin income the situation 0:situa 0:tion would obviously be greatly altered as 
 for the matter of the building program again he was negative he explained that revised foundation policies now inclined against 
 expenditures for brick and mortar it seems clear to me that i could not possibly hope for a favorable 0:fa 
 0:vorable reaction to a proposal that the foundation furnish all of the sum required for the proposed rebuilding if the 
 university can obtain from internal or other sources a fair fraction of the necessary amount we are prepared as in 
 all other cases to study the proposal it goes without saying that the probability for a favorable decision would increase 
 0:in 0:crease the larger the amount that can be furnished by the university martin wrote back to express his disappointment 
 with the result but stated his intention to take the matter up with the new principal and to renew his 
 bid at a later date 9 the only further contact that collip had with foundation officials that year was in 
 october when harry miller assistant director of the natural sciences division made a surprise visit to collip s laboratory collip 
 talked to him about his antihormone theory and gave him a rapid tour of the department miller was impressed that 
 although he had arrived unannounced almost all the staff were present and the place was a beehive of activity collip 
 and miller had some discussion of the financial state of the department collip explained that martin had no assurance of 
 local support for the building program but was sure that some would certainly be found if the foundation were to 
 award a grant although miller professed to know nothing about such a possibility he gently suggested that he had his 
 doubts whether the foundation would get involved in such a situation knowing that it would change in a matter of 
 a few years and that a large annual sum would be necessary to maintain the existing level of research miller 
 noted in his diary that in spite of the uncertainties of the financial situation 0:situ 0:ation and the threat to 
 the quality of animal material because of overcrowded 0:over 0:crowded animal quarters collip was planning an expansion of his research 
 program 30 in june 1935 mcgill named its new principal arthur morgan arrived 0:ar 0:rived from england where he had 
 gained a name in the administration of hull college stanley frost explained that the chancellor beatty and the new principal 
 took an instant dislike to each other they had divergent 0:diver 
 the private funding of research 19z8 1947 125 gent views on a number of important questions including their politics 0:poli 
 0:tics whereas the chancellor was politically conservative the principal was a little inclined to the left 3l this may have 
 had only a little to do with morgan s problems though frost remarked any new principal coming into office was 
 going to find it difficult to discover his own position of authority since beatty his associate george mcdonald a governor 
 and chairman of the finance committee and the bursar f owen stredder held tight control over the university s business 
 0:busi 0:ness affairs 31 at martin s suggestion the new principal contributed his voice to the bid for funding while 
 paying a visit to another branch of the rockefeller foundation in december morgan asked to see warren weaver to establish 
 contact and to talk about the biochemistry department 0:depart 0:ment application 33 weaver noted in his diary that morgan impressed 
 him the new principal had explained that collip and martin had considered 0:con 0:sidered that weaver s letter of 19 
 september had closed and locked the door but he wanted to inquire if the door is permanently bolted or not 
 weaver had replied that the foundation had a genuine interest in collip s work and recognized the importance of the 
 breadth of his approach to endocrine problems he had tactfully suggested however that he and the foundation officers agreed with 
 the somewhat general scientific opinion that it will be unfortunate if collip allows his energy 0:en 0:ergy enthusiasm and imagination 
 to lead him to spread himself too thin he had pressed this point further certain types of expansion to collip 
 s program would be a distinct dis service to both collip and to endocrinology 34 morgan recalled in his own 
 memorandum on the interview that weaver had spoken in terms of highest admiration of collip and respect 0:re 0:spect for 
 him as a man and a scientist but said that some of his best friends were nervous lest his great 
 imagination should lead him into too many fields the principal recorded that he had come to collip s defence suggesting 
 that while this broad program might in truth be dangerous for other people collip had been able to keep his 
 attention to his own work when a project had had multiple ramifications these branches were looked after by others morgan 
 was left with the sense that weaver had accepted this answer but in weaver s own record of the meeting 
 morgan s attempt failed to warrant a mention 3s at the meeting with weaver morgan also inquired about the foundation 
 s 0:foun 0:dation 0:s funding policies weaver explained that policy had changed from what it had been in the past 
 the foundation was no longer interested 0:inter 0:ested in funding general science and in building up departments of fundamental science 
 instead it was assisting projects in experimental biology particularly those fields that impinged on social problems 
 126 j b collip such as the problems of sex psychiatry and genetics morgan also asked whether an application for 
 a grant would be prejudiced by the fact that an institution had already received several gifts weaver admitted 0:ad 0:mitted 
 that there might be a tendency not to give too much to one place but that on the other hand 
 this tendency was outweighed by the fact that the foundation preferred to make grants to an institution with which it 
 was familiar 36 finally weaver suggested quite frankly that the succession of requests 0:re 0:quests from mcgill had not always 
 been carefully thought through especially 0:es 0:pecially in their financial implications weaver also made it clear that the foundation would 
 not be willing to entertain a proposal for expansion 0:expan 0:sion that did not clearly and definitely take into account 
 the crucial question of the looming loss of the insulin income after 1940 morgan conceded that the administrative situation at 
 mcgill had been confused and complicated of late but added quietly and decisively that this period was over mcgill had 
 spoken with several voices and its pronouncements 0:pro 0:nouncements had been confused but from that point on it would speak 
 with only one voice weaver noted that morgan gave every impression 0:im 0:pression of being a most clear minded and 
 forceful individual 37 after their first meeting morgan and weaver continued to correspond 0:corre 0:spond about the possibility of morgan 
 making another visit in the third week of january 1936 there is no record that such a meeting ever happened 
 0:hap 0:pened if it did not it may have been because morgan was experiencing difficulties closer to home during that 
 year he had a serious difference of opinion with beatty and the mcgill governors over the question of how the 
 university authorities should deal with the propagation of socialist views by mcgill faculty and students frost argues that the university 
 was considered to be a centre of socialist scholarship and teaching beatty and the governors felt that morgan was making 
 no effort 0:ef 0:fort to ensure that a capitalist view of society was advocated as well in the faculty of 
 medicine the year 1936 brought the retirement of c f martin a consequence of the governors of mcgill resolving to 
 uphold the regulation that members of staff be retired at the age of sixty five a rule that had not 
 been rigorously applied before then martin already several years beyond the limit was forced to give up his deanship after 
 a remarkable thirteen years in the post his departure was a great loss to collip who had regarded him as 
 a mentor martin was succeeded by grant fleming 3b in september 1936 collip was invited to be a guest speaker 
 at the grand celebrations for the harvard tercentenary there he was presented 0:pre 0:sented with an honorary doctorate and cited 
 as a skillful bio chemist a bold explorer among the tangled complexities of the internal secretions 0:secre 0:tions at harvard 
 he was in the company of distinguished scientists 
 the private funding of research 1 9 z 8 194 7 127 and scholars including nine nobel prize winners when 
 he presented his paper he shared the stage with such notable figures as jean piaget charles gustav jung and rudolf 
 carnap he was asked to participate in a symposium entitled factors determining human behaviour that included talks on the physiological 
 psychological and cultural elements 0:ele 0:ments that contributed to behaviour collip presented a paper about the endocrine factors related to 
 human behaviour and drew upon the work of a number of hormone researchers to suggest the ways in which the 
 actions of the individual might be affected by endocrine activity he carefully noted that both hereditary factors and the external 
 environment 0:environ 0:ment were capable of producing changes in hormone levels 39 it is noteworthy that the topic of collip 
 s paper fell squarely within the bounds of the program that weaver had devised for the natural science 0:sci 0:ence 
 division of the rockefeller foundation this was the only occasion 0:occa 0:sion in which collip so directly dealt with the 
 subject in public several years later collip responded to some questions that zoologist william rowan had asked him about possible 
 analogies between races of doves and human races as characterized by distinct levels of hormone activity 0:activ 0:ity during his 
 years in alberta collip had assisted rowan in his study of the reproductive biology of migratory birds and had inspired 
 him to investigate the influence of hormones collip replied this is a subject upon which i have always hesitated to 
 commit myself in print for the reason that i have no firsthand knowledge on it and also because so much 
 bunk has been written about it he commented of his harvard tercentenary address this is as far as i have 
 ever gone in discussing this general subject 4o the only further contact that collip had with the foundation that year 
 was an accidental meeting with f b hanson weaver s assistant director at a lunch table at the harvard tercentenary 
 hanson recalled in his diary that collip had inquired about the chances of getting some money for his work saying 
 that he had a great need for space and that his need would become acute in the future when the 
 insulin royalties ran out hanson had been non committal and had merely suggested that collip and morgan should take up 
 the matter with the foundation formally hanson noted that collip had seemed to be under the impression 0:impres 0:sion that 
 some definite request was under study by foundation officers or had perhaps been rejected without his knowledge upon his return 
 to new york hanson inquired about the status of the collip application 0:applica 0:tion and discovered that as he had 
 expected no official request was pending he noted that the position of the foundation was that the next move was 
 up to martin in january of the following year weaver officially marked the collip file dormant they to make next 
 approach 4l because of misunderstandings and changing priorities 
 j b collip 128 and perhaps because martin was no longer there to push things forward 0:for 0:ward that next 
 step was never taken by the mcgill group and the long series of negotiations with the rockefeller foundation came to 
 naught the failure of collip s proposal was the result of many factors one of the most significant being that 
 the foundation had simply shifted its priorities from institution building to project grants the depression years had begun to have 
 an effect on the income available to the rockefeller 0:rock 0:efeller foundation and the trustees now insisted that the officers 
 cut back on long term commitments this was a situation that foundation officers as well as grant seekers found extremely 
 frustrating alan gregg the head of the medical sciences division and a man of broad vision 0:vi 0:sion understood the 
 need to establish and endow several centres of psychiatric and neurological research but his plans were frequently thwarted by the 
 limitations set by the trustees he did secure the endowment 0:en 0:dowment and grant for the neurological institute at mcgill 
 in 1932 despite this new emphasis on project grants the 1 282 652 grant for the institute was the largest 
 appropriation from his division that year amounting to approximately one third of his total funds between 1935 and 1937 in 
 particular gregg felt a growing discontent over the increasing insistence of the trustees that commitments be made for no more 
 than one year by 1937 he was prepared to tender his resignation over this issue wilder penfield gregg s biographer 
 noted that gregg was convinced to stay on even though no further institutes were built in addition to this overall 
 change in foundation policy the natural sciences division policy also worked against collip s dream robert kohler argues that although 
 the natural sciences division encouraged cross disciplinary connections it did not challenge the traditional departmental 0:de 0:partmental and disciplinary boundaries 
 during these years the foundation 0:founda 0:tion was impervious to appeals to endow research professorships or to set up special 
 institutes outside the formal departmental structure 41 the foundation also rejected collip s proposal on intellectual grounds on the surface 
 collip s work on the anterior pituitary hormones was a good candidate for funding from the natural sciences division first 
 the officers had a great deal of respect for collip s abilities as a scientist although 0:al 0:though collip s 
 investigations were not specifically related to human behaviour 0:be 0:haviour weaver s program was sufficiently broad to include studies of 
 endocrinology genetics and other biological sciences that provided an understanding of the physical processes underlying behaviour herbert evans collip s 
 competitor in the pituitary field received funding from the division to the amount of 20 000 per year throughout the 
 1930s 43 weaver s concern was the one expressed by smith and engle collip was trying to take on too 
 broad a range of problems and was not being sufficiently 0:suffi 0:ciently thorough with any one subject this was something 
 that collip 
 the private funding of research 1928 1947 129 was not willing to change his restless personality expressed itself in this 
 and other aspects of his life moreover throughout his career he achieved a great deal of success through his habit 
 of skimming the cream off one problem and moving quickly on to the next as the head of a large 
 enthusiastic group he was content to allow his associates to follow their own interests rather than tie them to his 
 own projects a third factor behind the failure of collip s application was that it was poorly presented martin and 
 collip neglected to explain the financial 0:fi 0:nancial implications of their proposal in an open and businesslike manner 0:man 0:ner 
 their lack of clarity was partly due to their wish to ask for as much as possible from the foundation 
 and their reluctance to tip their hand too early in addition it seems likely that they were hoping or perhaps 
 gambling that the foundation would be willing to make up the lost insulin 0:in 0:sulin income after 1940 unfortunately that 
 was precisely the type of financial commitment that the foundation was no longer willing to make further the new style 
 of grant giving was highly personal robert 0:rob 0:ert kohler notes that weaver was adept at separating his impression of 
 the scientist from his evaluation of the work 44 but perhaps in this episode 0:epi 0:sode the sometimes unhappy mix 
 of personalities mishandled meetings 0:meet 0:ings and inaccurate interpretations all contributed to the negative final outcome the rockefeller foundation continued 
 to support medical research at mcgill throughout this period but only through grants for specific projects often these grants were 
 renewed for several years in a row but commitments were almost always made only one year at a time collip 
 s former associates hans selye and j s l browne were the recipients 0:recip 0:ients of several foundation grants weaver 
 was not averse to considering 0:consider 0:ing a broader proposal for the support of endocrinology at mcgill but he remarked 
 in 1937 that although there have been approaches of this sort they have never come to anything because of a 
 variety of administrative 0:ad 0:ministrative and financial complications 4s the emmenin fund mortgage over the next years collip s relationship 
 with the administration reflected 0:re 0:flected his deepening dissatisfaction with his institutional position and his desire for greater recognition as 
 well his children were growing up and he seems to have felt a need to have his family live in 
 proper style on 8 april 1937 collip met with the principal a e morgan on his own initiative collip was 
 concerned about a number of issues first he asked for assurance that if he were to leave mcgill an agreement 
 could be struck so that he could continue to have access to the emmenin royalties 0:roy 0:alties if this thinly 
 veiled threat were not enough collip went on to 
 j b collip 130 stress that he had no intention or desire to leave at that time morgan agreed that 
 mcgill could make the same sort of arrangement for emmenin 0:em 0:menin that toronto had for insulin next collip asked 
 that the royalties 0:royal 0:ties be specified as belonging to a department of which he was the head rather than 
 to the department of biochemistry because he might at some time be assigned to a separate department of endocrinology morgan 
 also agreed to this collip then talked vaguely about his salary and his 1 500 travel expense account it seemed 
 to morgan that collip 0:col 0:lip was hinting at getting a higher salary but he did not ask directly nor 
 did morgan promise anything finally collip brought forward a proposal he argued that this idea had already been under discussion 
 with sir arthur currie and he was certain it would have been carried out if currie had lived this was 
 a scheme by which the university would purchase collip s house and allow him to use it for a nominal 
 rent collip even suggested that this might be financially advantageous to the university as it would be able to invest 
 the royalties from emmenin 0:emme 0:nin in real property morgan did not discuss the matter seriously at that time but 
 merely indicated that he did not think the board of governors would approve such an arrangement morgan noted that collip 
 did not press it 46 two years earlier mcgill had been given a bequest of four twentieths 0:four 0:twenti 0:eths 
 of the estate of william g cheney the annual income of which was to be applied to the establishment of 
 a chair or chairs to assist the faculty of medicine perhaps in part to make up for the disappointing result 
 of the rockefeller bid the board of governors decided in 1937 to direct the income of 17 000 from the 
 bequest to the biochemistry department for five years and to create the gilman cheney chair of endocrinology for collip certainly 
 this income helped collip s financial 0:finan 0:cial situation in the short term a second chair of biochemistry was established 
 0:es 0:tablished for david thomson 47 on 15 april a week after his meeting with morgan collip wrote two letters 
 to the principal one to convey his appreciation for the establishment 0:es 0:tablishment of the cheney chair 48 and the 
 second to suggest that his department s 0:de 0:partment 0:s name be changed from the department of biochemistry and pathology 
 to the department of biochemistry and endocrinology in view of the fact that something like ninety per cent of our 
 research work has to do with the general subject of endocrinology i have felt in recent years that the department 
 has not been adequately named the addition of this word endocrinology seems to me to be the most desirable 49 
 morgan had no opportunity to act on this request in early april he had become embroiled in an argument with 
 mcdonald stredder and beatty over how much control the principal and the governors should 
 the private funding of research 1928 1947 131 respectively have over the university budget by 17 april morgan was forced 
 to resign macdonald college vice principal w h brittain was made acting principal in his place so during the summer 
 collip continued to have conversations with the bursar owen stredder about his proposal that a house be purchased for him 
 in october collip pursued the matter with the dean of medicine 0:medi 0:cine fleming and the associate dean simpson after 
 some consideration 0:consider 0:ation fleming and simpson decided to recommend to the acting principal that the university accede to a 
 modified version of collip s plan the emmenin fund under collip s direction had accumulated the royalties from the sale 
 of emmenin for the past several years and by that date amounted to approximately 28 000 collip was told that 
 the finance committee was unlikely to entertain a plan to purchase a house for him but might instead allow the 
 university to take up a mortgage 0:mort 0:gage on a property that he purchased the bursar also suggested that the 
 committee might consider a proposal from the dean of medicine that collip s salary be increased by the amount needed 
 to meet the difference 0:dif 0:ference between the carrying charges on the house he presently owned and the one he 
 was to purchase about 1 500 per annum provided this increase were to come from the income from the emmenin 
 fund simpson rationalized the productiveness of any man intensively engaged 0:en 0:gaged in research is very largely dependent on his 
 freedom from outside worry the feeling that he is unable to make adequate provision for the well being and comfort 
 of his family is undoubtedly a distraction which will lessen his value to the institution for which he works simpson 
 admitted that there existed no precedent to determine how the emmenin fund should be controlled the emmenin fund like certain 
 other special funds which have come to the university through professor collip has rightly or wrongly been considered as one 
 which can be expended only on his recommendation in the absence of any agreement or stipulation to the contrary precedent 
 would justify him in considering 0:consid 0:ering that it may be spent in any way he may desire to further 
 the interests of his department he concluded it would seem that the fund could be used quite legitimately 0:legiti 0:mately 
 for the purpose suggested and that the net return to the university 0:univer 0:sity would be much greater if the 
 money were expended in this way than it would be if it were used for the purchase of equipment and 
 supplies sl by the end of the month the finance committee had approved the scheme increasing collip s salary by 
 1 500 using the income from the emmenin fund first and making up the remainder from the insulin 
 j b collip 132 fund the committee also made it clear that the capital from the emmenin 0:em 0:menin fund 
 was to be put under the direct control of the university and that no other expenditures were to be made 
 from it until it had grown sufficiently to provide the full 1 500 as income the committee approved a loan 
 of 28 000 at an interest rate of 5 per cent from the emmenin fund for the special purpose of 
 the purchase of the house for collip with this loan collip bought a new house in the prestigious westmount 0:west 
 0:mount neighbourhood of montreal in october 1937 this house on 622 sydenham avenue was the one after which collip named 
 his 622 pituitary extract collip s daughter recalls that it was very important 0:im 0:portant for her father to get 
 this house he wanted a proper place for his family to live their home before this had been a modest 
 but adequate 0:ade 0:quate semi detached house the sydenham house was grand in comparison 0:com 0:parison a handsome brick residence 
 with a red tile roof just south of king george park it came complete with fifteen rooms including a conservatory 
 four bathrooms and a library where collip sometimes received his scientific visitors the house also had seven open fireplaces 0:fire 
 0:places a large oak panelled reception hall a huge living room and even a billiard room where he could indulge 
 in one of his favourite pastimes si this use of the research fund was unconventional but the dean concluded 0:con 
 0:cluded that it was justified i believe it is fair to both parties to assume that payment of 1500 a 
 year is a full recognition of professor collip s original contribution in the discovery of the product and that the 
 royalties beyond the amount necessary to produce this 1500 are paid to the university in return for the publicity value 
 and the use of the university name and for the relatively small service necessary to maintain the standardization of the 
 product s3 broader responsibilities by the end of the decade larger events intervened to force collip s focus 0:fo 0:cus 
 away from his research enterprise and towards broader issues in 1938 he was invited to sit on the national research 
 council associate committee on medical research which was chaired by fred banting the following year with the start of the 
 war many scientists at mcgill and across the country threw themselves into research projects to support 0:sup 0:port the war 
 effort 54 investigations in medical subjects were coordinated 0:coordi 0:nated and supported by banting s associate committee collip and his 
 laboratory group were among the many who contributed to war research 0:re 0:search they investigated such subjects as methods of 
 preserving blood 
 the private funding of research 1928 1947 133 motion sickness and traumatic shock in may of 1940 frank blair hanson 
 of the rockefeller foundation ran into collip by accident while visiting mcgill collip again expressed concern that his income from 
 the insulin patents had only one year to go he talked about approaching 0:ap 0:proaching alan gregg for funds the 
 following year unless he should be completely immersed in war research by that time ss it must have been unpleasant 
 for collip to compare his situation with penfield s since the work of the neurological institute had continued 0:contin 0:ued 
 to garner greater support in addition to the rockefeller endowment 0:endow 0:ment of 1 million the institute received many gifts 
 from individual benefactors that were on a much larger scale than the donations that collip received from 1935 to 1939 
 mcgill s board of governors agreed to subscribe to a guarantee fund in order to balance the university s 0:univer 
 0:sity 0:s books when sir herbert s holt one of the governors was told that he would be given a 
 refund of 16 666 67 lewis douglas morgan s 0:mor 0:gan 0:s successor as principal from january 1938 wrote asking 
 holt whether he might consider returning this amount to the university for its general purposes holt agreed to this but 
 specified that he had already 0:al 0:ready promised penfield 5 000 for his research and noted that he would like 
 to give collip something for his research work as well while douglas was somewhat disappointed that these specific gifts would 
 take away from his general funds he agreed to discuss the matter 0:mat 0:ter with collip and determine what his 
 needs were when notified of this gift collip remarked that the news was a complete surprise to him since he 
 had never met sir herbert and was unaware that he intended to support his work he immediately telephoned holt and 
 had a very pleasant interview with him not one to miss such an opportunity collip emphasized that his chief financial 
 concern was not for the immediate 0:im 0:mediate present but for the future of his laboratory this emphasis turned out 
 to be profitable as holt made additional donations to the department in subsequent years in an interview with the bursar 
 collip said that he did not wish to make a claim for any specific amount of the holt donation leaving 
 that decision to the principal s discretion the bursar reported however that collip had made some intimation that an amount 
 equal to that allocated to dr penfield might be reasonable 0:reason 0:able the principal suggested to the bursar in a 
 marginal note that i think perhaps it would be better to make it 3 000 56 the insulin patents the 
 biggest money concern looming in collip s mind in these years was the end of the insulin royalties which were 
 set to expire in 1940 or 1941 this money had supported much of collip s work for the most 
 j b collip 134 active decades of his career and now the income made up more than half his departmental 
 budget as lome hutchison the executive secretary 0:secre 0:tary of the university of toronto insulin committee commented when the first 
 agreement had been drawn up in 192 3 no one had anticipated that it would operate beyond 1940 or 1941 
 at the latest now however 0:how 0:ever new circumstances brought a welcome surprise university of toronto 0:to 0:ronto researchers had 
 continued to develop insulin in the years since the original discovery and patents on these processes had also been assigned 
 0:as 0:signed to the committee the most notable of these was protamine zinc insulin developed by david scott and a 
 m fisher at the university of toronto connaught medical research laboratory between 1935 and 1940 this form of insulin had 
 the advantage of having a longer action than the original insulin collip would receive revenue from sales of the original 
 type of insulin as well as for sales of crystalline zinc insulin and protamine zinc insulin until 1956 when the 
 last of the patents expired 0:ex 0:pired after that lilly provided goodwill grants to best and collip not based on 
 any legal obligations but out of regard for the friendly relations 0:rela 0:tions they had developed over the years collip 
 was given a consultantship 0:consultant 0:ship of z 500 and his laboratory received a grant of 5 000 annually this 
 consultantship was to continue until collip s death and the laboratory 0:labo 0:ratory grant until three years after that s7 
 f cyril james in 1939 the principalship of mcgill changed hands for the third time in six years when war 
 threatened in europe lewis douglas an american 0:ameri 0:can felt compelled to resign and return to the united states there 
 he became the first director of the war shipping administration and later the u s ambassador to britain he was 
 succeeded by f cyril james an englishman who was professor of finance and economic history at the university of pennsylvania 
 douglas had initially appointed james to reorganize the mcgill school of commerce but james arrived in montreal 0:mon 0:treal on 
 3 september the day britain declared war seven days later canada declared war on her own by the end of 
 the following month the mcgill board asked james to assume the principalship james was to hold this position for the 
 next twenty years mcgill s historian stanley frost remarks that james ran a very efficient tightly geared almost one man 
 operation james quickly attained dominance in university 0:uni 0:versity affairs a development helped by the absence of the chancellor beatty 
 after a serious illness in 1939 while james acknowledged the authority of the board he gradually made it clear that 
 authority was to be exercised through his office 58 
 the private funding of research 1928 1947 135 banting s mantle in the two decades since the insulin discovery and 
 the attending turmoil among the discoverers banting and best had become increasingly estranged 0:es 0:tranged initially comfortable in his role 
 of hero and senior to his student assistant banting had amply rewarded best s loyalty by championing 0:cham 0:pioning his 
 claim to credit for the insulin work over the years however best had grown from a stalwart young assistant to 
 a fine researcher 0:re 0:searcher in his own right and had therefore become a challenge to banting banting and best 
 both at the university of toronto began to chafe at the bond that would forever link their names and seat 
 them next to each other at commemorative events banting whose research skills were limited struggled vainly to find another great 
 cure and to live up to the hopes invested in him by so many institutions and individuals 0:indi 0:viduals who 
 supported his research best over the years may have become 0:be 0:come less and less willing to take second place 
 to someone whom he had increasingly come to view as his inferior as a research scientist 59 on the other 
 hand banting and collip had become close friends after 0:af 0:ter their early legendary fights one story has the two 
 of them meeting again at the calgary stampede sometime in the mid 19 30s an event that was recorded by 
 collip s young son jack a keen photographer banting brought collip to work with him on the national research council 
 medical research committee and collip served as his assistant chairman from 1938 in february 1941 banting stopped on his way 
 through montreal to see collip before heading overseas on a warrelated 0:war 0:related mission michael bliss describes the warm conversation 
 they had in banting s hotel room reliving their insulin days collip noticed banting was without warm gloves when he 
 took him to the airport and insisted that he take his own sheepskin gloves as banting s plane flew over 
 newfoundland it crashed killing banting and two others 0 collip was badly shaken by the news of banting s death 
 his colleague 0:col 0:league george hunter at the department of biochemistry at the university 0:uni 0:versity of alberta wrote him 
 of the accident its sic the worst disaster in canadian history his mantle is going to fall on both charlie 
 best and you the mantle of responsibility in maintaining medical 0:medi 0:cal research in canada 61 later that year collip 
 won the charles mickle fellowship of the university of toronto banting s faithful assistant sadie gairns wrote collip with her 
 congratulations saying she felt that banting would have been very pleased she added that she was appalled that best had 
 been named as the obvious successor to banting s chair at the banting and best department of medical research at 
 toronto she told 
 136 j b collip collip that she had even gone so far as to tell the president that it was 
 the last person dr banting would want to succeed him 61 the research institute of endocrinology collip renewed his efforts 
 to have a research institute established in 1 94 1 perhaps he was responding to the fact that best now 
 had charge of his own research department perhaps he felt that he bore banting s mantle and thus deserved greater 
 institutional recognition or perhaps banting s death had signalled to him his own mortality the arrival of the new principal 
 brought a new opportunity to bring forward the proposal many years later after collip s death james candidly recalled his 
 acute observations and very definite view of collip in 1941 bert was an extraordinarily poor departmental chairman interested primarily in 
 his own researches and in those of the graduate students who happened to impinge on his own special interests this 
 fact led me to feel that somehow or other we should find a way of switching bert collip from the 
 important departmental 0:de 0:partmental chairmanship into a job appropriate to his prestige and talents but removed from the whole question 
 of under graduate teaching both in medicine 0:medi 0:cine and in arts and sciences 3 james was presented with a 
 solution to this problem when collip expressed 0:ex 0:pressed his wish for a research institute of endocrinology one comparable 0:compa 
 0:rable to the neurological institute james promptly seized on the idea and set about making it work out administratively even 
 though the university finances were very straitened at the time 64 in august 194 1 the board of governors set 
 up the research institute of endocrinology the terms were most generous it was first understood 0:under 0:stood that collip would 
 take the income from the insulin emmenin and pituitrin royalties with him to the new institute furthermore the university provided 
 7 000 towards physical reconstruction and moving 0:mov 0:ing expenses collip was appointed director of the institute but retained 0:re 
 0:tained his gilman cheney professorship which came with a substantial annual income of 17 000 in an attempt to reach 
 a somewhat more equitable and gradual readjustment of the financial arrangements between the new institute and the department of biochemistry 
 and probably to avoid impoverishing the department entirely it was determined 0:deter 0:mined that the whole of the cheney income 
 would not be given to the institute instead provision was made so that whenever collip s insulin income exceeded 10 
 000 then 8 500 of the cheney funds would be transferred back to biochemistry if however the insulin income fell 
 below 10 000 the cheney funds would be used to make up the difference 0:differ 
 the private funding of research 1928 1947 137 ence and the department would get what was left this gave collip 
 a guarantee of a sizable annual income 17 000 from the cheney bequest 0:be 0:quest at least 10 000 from 
 insulin and 4 000 from emmenin and pituitrin minus the 8 500 to biochemistry however the university was not prepared 
 to provide the institute with more than the cheney income james hoped that since collip and his staff were becoming 
 increasingly 0:in 0:creasingly preoccupied with war research and because so many of his projects were now funded by the government 
 perhaps he and his staff would not need to use that full amount in a letter to collip james wrote 
 that he shared collip s wish that instead enough income could be set aside to build up an endowment that 
 would ensure the stability of research funding in the future 5 collip s new institute occupied the west wing of 
 the medical building 0:build 0:ing the former location of the public health department while the rooms were old they were 
 light and airy and most importantly large enough to accommodate four or five researchers plus technicians 66 in leaving the 
 biochemistry department collip took with him robert noble and abe neufeld as his senior assistants david thomsom stayed on in 
 biochemisty and took over as the head of the department collip gave his graduate students and staff the option of 
 joining his institute 0:in 0:stitute or remaining in the department all chose to go with him except orville denstedt who 
 remained with thomson in addition to taking most of the staff and funds with him collip also took much of 
 the equipment even as late as 1950 members of the biochemistry department were still trying to make up for the 
 loss at that time denstedt negotiated with the university to buy a large used refrigerator that had been standing dismantled 
 for three or four years and that the university had been thinking of selling to the faculty club in a 
 rather pitiful letter denstedt had to explain that the department had been without a large refrigerator in the several years 
 since collip had left and that as a result the researchers had been forced to curtail their work on proteins 
 for lack of adequate refrigeration 67 after 194 1 collip succeeded banting as the chairman of the nrc associate 0:as 
 0:sociate committee on medical research during the final years of the war he found himself ever more preoccupied with administrative 
 responsibilities 0:re 0:sponsibilities his outlook changed too broadening out from his own research problems to the concerns of organizing medical 
 research across the country ironically now that he was finally established in his hard won new post as research professor 
 he spent more time away from his laboratory than ever he was grateful though that since his chair came with 
 no specific teaching responsibilities he was able to devote 0:de 0:vote his time and energies to wartime committee work without 
 causing a serious disruption 68 
 138 j b collip however all these new responsibilities and honours seemed not to be enough for collip only a 
 year after he won his institute he had a frank discussion with james expressing his interest in the position of 
 dean of graduate studies after some consideration james wrote to collip telling him that he was going to appoint david 
 thomson to the office instead james explained his rationale i feel more strongly than ever that it would be contrary 
 to the best interest of the university if we should regard appointment to any deanship as a reward for scholarly 
 merit a deanship to him was clearly an administrative office and required 0:re 0:quired someone who could be available at 
 all times to pay attention to routine details and to undertake a lot of donkey work it required someone who 
 was willing to put the university at the centre of his career 0:ca 0:reer james noted pointedly that it was 
 necessary for the dean to be familiar 0:fa 0:miliar with teaching he gently suggested that when the war is over 
 and you are able to lay down the heavy burden of national 0:na 0:tional research council work which you have 
 so generously undertaken in the public interest your scientific eminence and your detailed knowledge of the canadian scene in matters 
 of scientific research would make you an outstanding 0:outstand 0:ing candidate for the deanship the present moment however i feel 
 that those wider activities would be a handicap to you in dealing with the domestic problems 0:prob 0:lems of the 
 university i hope that you will on reflection realize that this decision 0:de 0:cision is in no sense a reflection 
 upon your own scientific eminence of which i and all your colleagues are very proud 69 the war meant the 
 total disruption of the work of the new endocrinology 0:endocri 0:nology institute collip s own energies were devoted to the 
 administrative 0:administra 0:tive work of the nrc and to serving as canada s medical liaison officer for the united states 
 he spent much of the period travelling between ottawa and washington making stops in montreal whenever possible abe neufeld had 
 taken a position as a resident liaison officer in the office 0:of 0:fice of the u s surgeon general in 
 washington in montreal bob noble plunged himself into war research one dramatic 0:dra 0:matic addition to the institute was a 
 large swing he built to study motion 0:mo 0:tion sickness a problem faced by sailors and airmen paratroops and commandos 
 noble contributed a considerable amount of research on the use of barbiturates to treat the problem 7o in biochemistry orville 
 denstedt produced important work on the storage of human blood and devised a method of preserving whole blood for six 
 to eight weeks blood donated by volunteers was preserved according to his procedure and shipped overseas to britain after the 
 invasion of europe though never in quantities sufficient for clinical use 71 collip and noble also conducted some research on 
 the use of cortical extracts to prevent or 
 the private funding of research 1928 1947 139 alleviate shock noble s inventive mind even led him into fields that 
 were not much related to medical science fascinated by the problem of the movement of troops across stretches of muddy 
 countryside noble developed mud shoes something of a cross between snowshoes and skis he filmed trials of his prototype in 
 action on the muddy clay of mcgill s grounds as well as in greenwich connecticut 72 after the war a 
 rockefeller officer once again visited collip at mcgill during his visit r s morison an assistant director under alan gregg 
 gained the distinct impression that the research institute of endocrinology had never really gotten going collip was still very much 
 involved with the nrc war committees and it seemed likely he would be made director of any peacetime committee of 
 the council that might be established morison noted that collip seemed to harbour feelings of annoyance for warren weaver believing 
 that weaver had somehow blocked a rockefeller grant for his proposed addition to the biological building some ten years earlier 
 since morison had not known the details of the case he had simply tried to explain to collip that bricks 
 and mortar expenditures had stopped just about that time as a matter of policy concerned morison related this conversation 0:conversa 
 0:tion to weaver when he returned to the rockefeller in answer to his questions weaver gave him the decade old 
 file on collip s application after studying the file morison wrote to weaver i had suspected that collip s intensity 
 of feeling was greater than his knowledge on this point and concluded and the prophesy of his spreading himself too 
 thin seems to have been pretty amply fulfilled 73 once the war was over collip found it difficult to settle 
 into research work again finding the research facilities in his new institute inadequate 0:inade 0:quate he began to discuss proposals 
 for expansion with the brothers samuel and allan bronfman of the seagrams distillery fortune sam bronfman had given generously to 
 mcgill for many years in his attempt to gain an invitation to sit on the board of governors an entree 
 into in montreal s anglo society according michael marrus bronfman s biographer 0:biog 0:rapher bronfman found himself excluded from the 
 board because of strong anti semitic sentiments at mcgill and particularly because of the personal opposition of j w mcconnell 
 then the publisher of the montreal 0:mon 0:treal star and mcgill s most generous benefactor bronfman had to wait until 
 1965 after mcconnelfs death to reach his g0a1 74 during this period collip worked with the bronfmans to develop a 
 plan for the construction of additional laboratory facilities at mcgill s macdonald college at ste anne de bellevue on the 
 western end of the island of montreal macdonald college was the home of mcgill s agricultural 0:agri 0:cultural school and 
 the school of household science the proposed new building was intended to enable collip and his staff to carry out 
 
 j b collip 140 larger scale experiments than were possible in the medical building by 1947 plans for the macdonald 
 campus building were so advanced that bob noble and his family bought a house out at ste anne de bellevue 
 in preparation for the move 7s a fresh start the university of western ontario at the same time a very 
 different proposal was presented to collip g e hall was about to leave his position as dean of medicine at 
 the university of western ontario uwo to take up the presidency at the university ed hall was a medical scientist 
 and a former protege of banting s he was also a friend and long time admirer of collip s and 
 the two had worked together on the wartime committees of the nrc during the war hall had written to him 
 your contributions to the council itself have been great and many of us recognize just how much you have put 
 into making the whole medical research aspects of the nrc an international success our appreciation for your work is unbounded 
 0:un 0:bounded and i express the feelings of many 76 now the ambitious hall hoped to turn this friendly connection 
 into a real coup for western he offered collip the deanship of medicine as well as an appointment as head 
 of a new department of medical research 0:re 0:search hall had great plans for his university and bringing a scientist 
 of collip s stature to head the medical school was a bold move with his research institute in place and 
 his plans for expansion with the bronfmans already underway not many would have expected collip 0:col 0:lip to be tempted 
 by this invitation not only would he be moving from a research position to an administrative one he would be 
 going from one of the two top universities in the country to a much less prestigious school the collip of 
 1947 though may have been quite a different man from the one he had been in the prewar days when 
 he had been rivetted to his bench the happy centre of activity in his lab with the war over collip 
 found it difficult to return to research with the same vigour he had had before the rockefeller s morison had 
 even ventured 0:ven 0:tured this opinion in his notes i should take even money that his own research days are 
 over in 1948 collip admitted in a draft of a lecture i find it extremely difficult after a lapse of 
 so many years in which i have been engaged in administrative duties for the most part to discuss research problems 
 the pursuit of which in a personal way i have now been so far removed 77 collip may also have 
 been dissatisfied with the recognition he had received at mcgill j c meakins was retiring that year vacating his post 
 as dean of medicine and some suggested that collip aspired to 
 the private funding of research 1928 1947 141 succeed him certainly collip had expressed his interest in becoming dean of 
 graduate studies several years earlier finally after spending several years involved in questions of organizing medical research collip 0:col 0:lip 
 began to feel that he had some experience to offer in this area he thought he might want to take 
 on the new challenge of administering a medical school collip explained in a letter to charles martin and his wife 
 that having been at mcgill for nineteen years he was wary of the problems associated with a large prominent medical 
 school he noted pointedly that he was especially concerned with the uncoordinated growth of the various departments and the favouritism 
 shown to certain 0:cer 0:tain divisions thus the university of western ontario offer presented an opportunity to start afresh and 
 try out his own ideas about running a medical faculty 7b by march collip began to give hints that he 
 was considering the move he wrote to james requesting a formal statement about the disposition 0:dis 0:position of his various 
 research funds should he move to another medical 0:medi 0:cal school he suggested that if such a move were to 
 happen the insulin fund should be transferred with him in toto royalties for the products he had developed at mcgill 
 might be split one half to remain at mcgill and the other half to go with him to his new 
 institution one month later hall was able to present collip with an official offer at this stage collip spoke with 
 james and told him frankly of the offer from western the mcgill board agreed with collip s reasoning that the 
 entire insulin fund which he had brought to mcgill with him should be transferred with him but that half the 
 accumulated capital and half the future revenues of the emmenin pituitrin and premarin funds should remain at mcgill in a 
 letter to collip in april james agreed that he could see the attraction of the uwo offer but protested i 
 am still of the opinion that with the developments which we have discussed and foreshadowed you would find yourself even 
 happier at mcgill university during the next decade 79 collip s associates bob noble and don heard were offered appointments 
 0:appoint 0:ments at western as well as professor and associate professor respectively 0:respec 0:tively noble despite the fact that he 
 and his wife had already purchased a home near macdonald college decided to follow collip heard a talented steroid chemist 
 chose to turn down the offer from western as well as another tempting offer from an american research institute in 
 order to stay at mcgill hall wrote to notify james that these offers had been made and james replied it 
 is scarcely necessary for me to say that you would be very fortunate indeed if you were able to persuade 
 collip to accept such an appointment but to reciprocate 0:recip 0:rocate your frankness i had told dr collip that i 
 should like to see him remain 
 j b collip 142 at mcgill university and shall do all that i can to encourage him to reach that 
 decision he is so popular a member of the medical faculty and so distinguished 0:distin 0:guished a scientist that his 
 departure would leave a very uncomfortable vacancy 0:va 0:cancy in our ranks 80 collip s mind had already been made 
 up he had decided to go to london the news that collip had accepted the appointment at western came as 
 a shock to many of his friends and associates at mcgill many called the loss of such an outstanding scientist 
 a terrible blow to megilps reputation 0:rep 0:utation james had been very occupied with the task of building a strong 
 academic staff and had been able to make numerous junior appointments 0:ap 0:pointments to various departments but none of the 
 new staff had yet proved themselves and certainly none had yet attained the stature of someone like collip w w 
 chipman a governor and a past associate of collip s telephoned the principal to ask for an explanation of collip 
 s departure he demanded that james explain how he had failed to prevent 0:pre 0:vent this great loss to mcgill 
 james defended himself arguing that he had helped to create the research institute of endocrinology for collip giving the scientist 
 an organization over which he had full control collip 0:col 0:lip had also always had ample funds in the years 
 since his arrival collip s royalty income had brought close to three quarters of a million dollars to mcgill more 
 than half from insulin and the remainder from emmenin premarin and pituitrin james argued that there was not shortage of 
 money is indicated by the fact that the university will have to transfer very substantial funds to the university of 
 western ontario when collip leaves us indeed collip took some 160 000 with him to western james further explained that 
 he had been working over the past year with collip and the bronfmans on plans for the research laboratories 0:lab 
 0:oratories at macdonald college the bronfmans had agreed only a few weeks before to pay approximately 100 000 for the 
 construction james had even assured collip that if he could be encouraged to stay on he could have anything he 
 wanted within reasonable limits 81 james offered the opinion that collip had decided to go to london because he and 
 his wife wanted to live in a smaller centre as well collip 0:col 0:lip had developed many ideas on the 
 philosophy of medical education and he wanted to try his hand at being dean of a medical school with a 
 small student body and faculty when james had been considering a successor to meakins as dean of medicine he had 
 consulted with collip 0:col 0:lip according to james collip had stated definitely that he would not under any circumstances accept 
 the post since the mcgill medical faculty 0:fac 0:ulty was too large and amorphous and had all the problems of 
 keeping several large departments together along with the difficulties of maintaining 0:main 
 the private funding of research 192 8 1947 143 taining relations with two teaching hospitals james concluded his explanation 0:ex 
 0:planation by detailing the generous financial provisions that mcgill had made for collip from his handsome salary to the items 
 purchased for his private library out of research funds to the large mortgage on his house in westmount for which 
 he had not been asked for capital repayments 81 collip s own rationale for the move is suggested in a 
 letter he wrote to charles martin the man who had brought him to mcgill many years before i thought i 
 would be a fixture there for the rest of my active 0:ac 0:tive days and if fate had been sufficiently 
 kind to have allowed you to remain my mentor i feel quite sure that such would have been the case 
 all in all however i must admit that mcgill hasn t treated me too badly but things could never be 
 or have they been the same after you relinquished 0:relin 0:quished the deanship of medicine he commented on the surprise 
 generated by his announcement i rather fear that some of my friends not conversant with all the circumstances will feel 
 that i am taking a backward step but of this i personally have no misgivings 0:mis 0:givings as i am 
 completely satisfied that in the theoretical ten years of service that remain to me i should be able to contribute 
 vastly more to the field of med r and teaching than i possibly could at mcgill quite irrespective of the 
 rosy picture which the principal has endeavored to paint for me with the added privilege so to speak of writing 
 my own ticket he continued the one thing that gives me most concern is the possibility that this move may 
 be considered as something of sour grapes the deanship of medicine at mcgill today holds no attraction whatever for me 
 as you will doubtless be well able to understand i think fred smith in agreeing to accept this post is 
 doing it entirely out of a sense of duty and self sacrifice for all of which he has my profound 
 0:pro 0:found admiration and should i have decided to remain at mcgill there is probably 0:prob 0:ably no other person 
 who could have been selected for this post with whom i could be in so much sympathy collip also talked 
 candidly about the disappointments he had experienced 0:experi 0:enced with research at his institute as i recall it you never 
 showed any great enthusiasm on my transfer from the chair of my first home at mcgill in which you and 
 sir arthur installed me in 19z8 to the so called institute of endocrinology looking back at it now i realize 
 all too well how right you were as i now consider the latter to have been an abortion 0:abor 0:tion 
 from the start there probably was no other way to solve the exigencies that 
 j b collip 144 arose as a result of the war and i should be eternally grateful for the fact 
 that this move allowed me to give practically full time to government service no endocrine 0:endo 0:crine work of any 
 significance has been done in this institute but i must say i am very proud of the contributions which the 
 staff were able to make in so called war research in going therefore to be chair of m r you 
 will i am sure understand 0:under 0:stand that i cannot have many regrets at leaving the top floor of the 
 west wing of the medical building now so hopelessly inadequate for modern laboratory space the alternative to this you know 
 was to build another institute at st anne s with the help of mr bronfman strange to say or perhaps 
 not so strange i have never been able to get very enthusiastic about this latter project thus this new post 
 would offer a fresh start at london on the other hand the situation is almost ideal it s a small 
 school strictly limited to 60 students per year the departments for the most part staffed by young men in their 
 thirties with already proven abilities with fine personalities and a cooperative spirit which would do your heart good to see 
 the mcd library is one of the best in canada a brand new 600 bed hospital is just across the 
 street from the teaching and research labs and there is the closest cooperation between the surgical and medical dept and 
 all of these it really gives me a great thrill to see all of this and to realize that it 
 will be up to me to integrate and greatly expand the whole program there it is my intention to so 
 develop in as far as i am able the dept of m r which by the way has been stripped 
 bare for my inheritance so that there is no dead wood to be dealt with so that it will fit 
 into the picture as a whole supporting and collaborating with all of the pre clinical as well as the clinical 
 departments so that the school should go forward as a whole rather than in the favoured development in special 0:spe 
 0:cial parts i know that it may be hard to keep to this ideal but i have seen enough of 
 the opposite at mcgill in the mushroom spawning of specialized labs uncoordinated and unrelated to any external policy 8 comments 
 from colleagues were mixed harold ettinger of queen s university framed the appointment as a coup for hall and western 
 this is the most important challenge that ed has yet thrown at the other ontario medical schools c j mackenzie 
 president of the nrc remarked i have no doubt that from your personal standpoint you will find the change not 
 only pleasant but exhilarating and we are all looking forward to great things to come out of western other friends 
 were less enthusiastic and commented that they did not know whether to offer congratulations or not a montreal associate reported 
 that the news of collip s departure was the general topic of conversation at lunch at the university club and 
 that no one was happy to know that he was leaving collip was grateful to have one friend who fully 
 appreciated 0:appre 
 the private funding of research 192 8 1947 145 ciated the opportunities he felt this offered him charles mitchell animal 
 pathologist at the department of agriculture had served with collip on nrc committees and wrote it seems to me that 
 you will be placed in a position which will give scope for the organization of medical training and medical research 
 and that when you quit the post some years hence a legacy will be left behind of better facilities for 
 undergraduate and postgraduate training it is regrettable that mcgill should lose your services i know that much of the fame 
 of the medical school of mcgill university at the present time is the result of your research too often universities 
 overlook the capacity of workers for organizing research on a wider field and which actually gives more scope for activities 
 on a wider plane b4 when collip moved to london in addition to taking much of the research 0:re 0:search 
 funding with him he also took a great deal of the equipment that had been purchased over the years out 
 of the various research funds the residue of the funds at mcgill were made into a collip research 0:re 0:search 
 fund that provided grants and scholarships for research in the pre clinical sciences ayerst mckenna and harrison having developed a 
 long association with collip devised a scheme to divert more of their support to western likely in consultation with collip 
 ayerst renegotiated 0:renegoti 0:ated its agreement with mcgill instead of royalties ayerst offered to pay a fixed annual sum this 
 sum was less than half the amount the university gained through its royalties and as the mcgill bursar suspected 0:sus 
 0:pected ayerst then took the amount saved and donated it to the university 0:uni 0:versity of western ontario for collip 
 s work but as david thomson noted ruefully mcgill was in no position to argue it no longer contributed 0:con 
 0:tributed to controlling the manufacture of emmenin nor was the use of the mcgill name likely to be of as 
 much value to the firm as it had been in the early years more importantly collip took his strong research 
 0:re 0:search reputation with him to western at mcgill j s l browne continued to produce important work in clinical 
 endocrinology at the royal victoria hospital david thomson was appointed to the gilman cheney chair and remained head of the 
 biochemistry department and dean of graduate studies thomson who had always been at his best as a teacher and later 
 as an administrator was too occupied with his other duties to personally continue the research 0:re 0:search tradition thomson urged 
 the principal to try to hang on to don heard who had been receiving invitations from other institutions thomson argued 
 that heard a steroid chemist with an international reputation can do much to prevent mcgill from losing the fame it 
 has long had as a source of leadership in endocrinology bs 
 j b collip 146 sustaining a research enterprise during his years at mcgill collip had developed a research enterprise that 
 had few equals in canada he successfully built his career on the dual legacy of his insulin achievement an international 
 reputation and a substantial royalty income one of the chief needs of his canadian 0:cana 0:dian research contemporaries was a 
 reliable source of funding collip was able to secure this through his royalties first from insulin and later from emmenin 
 premarin and with less success pituitrin a sizable portion of his research program was devoted to developing therapeutically 0:therapeuti 0:cally 
 valuable products while collip may have been motivated by the wish to make a contribution as dramatic as insulin he 
 was certainly also well aware that the commercial success of such products could help to support a research program he 
 very actively promoted the commercial development of his many hormone extracts like other researcher entrepreneurs of this era he also 
 solicited the aid of private individuals and philanthropic foundations as one of the more renowned scientists in canada collip was 
 able to attract the interest 0:in 0:terest of a number of patrons while he resented having to take time from 
 his researches he knew the importance of cultivating personal relationships 0:re 0:lationships with wealthy benefactors seeking foundation support was a 
 complicated matter that involved strategies and perseverance that collip was seriously considered for a major rockefeller foundation grant speaks to 
 his eminence as a scientist his abilities as laboratory chief and the importance and currency of his work on pituitary 
 hormones 0:hor 0:mones that his bid failed reflects the incompatibility of his aims with those of the foundation their differing 
 views on the scope of his research 0:re 0:search program as well as more mundane problems of administration while collip 
 was willing to play up the behavioural implications of his studies to some extent he was unwilling or perhaps unable 
 to change his broadly focused approach to the field as one of megilps most distinguished scientists collip was in a 
 good position to negotiate with the university in the most active phase of his research career his concerns centred on 
 gaining a stable source of funding and a release from teaching and administrative duties when the rockefeller application failed the 
 medical faculty was able to divert 0:di 0:vert money from a large general endowment to his department his unusually 0:un 
 0:usually comfortable position of having authority over sizable research funds put the university in the very unorthodox position of having 
 to authorize a mortgage for his private home out of money designated for research purposes and then having to justify 
 the arrangement as a means of securing a happier employee 
 the private funding of research 192 8 1947 147 later as government work took collip away from the research bench 
 he aspired to gain greater recognition in other ways he seems to have regarded the deanship of graduate studies at 
 least in part as an appropriate reward for his research achievements while documents of 1947 james s letter to chipman 
 and collip s own vigorous protest to martin seem to indicate that collip did not desire the deanship of medicine 
 at mcgill later material at least suggests that he had been ambivalent james recalled in 1965 just after collip s 
 death that he had felt that collip was quite happy with his position at the research institute but that as 
 he approached the age of retirement rather like penfield he did not wish to retire and was rather annoyed at 
 the suggestion 0:sug 0:gestion that he was not different from all the other members of the staff james also remembered 
 it was only in our discussions after his appointment at western that i realised he had long cherished the idea 
 that he would make an ideal dean of the faculty of medicine at mcgill i may be wrong but i 
 think that it would have been a calamitous 0:ca 0:lamitous appointment for us although i think he did reasonably well 
 at western with a smaller faculty and a medical scientist as president of the university 86 the lengths to which 
 the medical faculty and the university went to accommodate collip indicate how valuable his work and reputation were to them 
 in maintaining the strong medical tradition at the close of the war perhaps recognizing that his best research days were 
 behind him collip decided that it would be best to use his years of knowledge and experience in a different 
 way it became apparent 0:appar 0:ent that he desired something that mcgill could no longer provide a place in which 
 he could start anew and try out the ideas he had been cultivating over many years in choosing the deanship 
 at the university of western ontario he was perhaps accepting a role befitting not a scientist in his prime but 
 an elder statesman of medical research in canada 
 7 the rise of public funding 193 8 1968 medical research on a national level medical research in canada is 
 at the critical stage i believe that this discussion that we have had today is extremely important inasmuch as it 
 is passing on to the government the responsibility for medical research today will go down in our history as marking 
 an epoch we have taken a step in the right direction sir frederick banting conference on the organization of medical 
 research in canada 18 february 193 818 1 since his days as a graduate student at the university of toronto 
 collip had been a dedicated scientist who loved nothing more than working away at some new problem late into the 
 night he had continually struggled 0:strug 0:gled to arrange his working conditions so that he could devote himself exclusively to 
 research his perspective on medical research began to broaden however when he accepted the invitation to sit on the national 
 research council s associate committee on medical research in 1938 collip s colleagues were surprised by how enthusiastically he took 
 to the intensive committee work because he had previously shown very little interest 0:in 0:terest in administrative matters 2 his 
 involvement with the medical research 0:re 0:search arm of the nrc stretched over the next twenty years and became one 
 of his primary occupations in shaping policy he drew from his own experiences in the world of science while his 
 glory days at the bench were now over he was able to support those who followed by helping to establish 
 the systematic funding of medical research activities in canada for most of collip s career he had funded the research 
 of his laboratory 0:labora 0:tory through private means the most significant source of funds was the royalties from therapeutic products 
 that he had helped to develop such as insulin emmenin and premarin collip also received some grants from philanthropic foundations 
 and private benefactors towards 0:to 0:wards the end of his career he saw the burden of financing medical research 0:re 
 0:search pass to the government and indeed helped to shepherd in this new development his well established research enterprise at 
 mcgill was a prime candidate for public funds he and his laboratory group were among the first to benefit from 
 government grants 
 the rise of public funding 193 8 1968 149 the funding and coordination of medical research officially became a governmental 
 responsibility in canada when the national research council established its associate committee on medical research in 1938 medical research was 
 fostered by the nrc from that point on until 0:un 0:til i960 when the independent medical research council was created 
 the policies and practices developed by the associate committee and its successor the division of medical research helped to institutionalize 
 0:institutional 0:ize and shape the growth of canadian medical science 3 the early members of the associate committee struggled with 
 the problem of how to promote research on a national basis institutional support for research was generally low in canadian 
 universities of this period academic scientists often carried heavy teaching loads and lacked sufficient funds to hire assistants or purchase 
 equipment furthermore 0:further 0:more investigators particularly those outside toronto and montreal experienced intellectual isolation from their scientific peers finally aspiring 
 0:as 0:piring canadian students found insufficient opportunities and support for post graduate study and too few academic posts once they 
 had completed 0:com 0:pleted their education the result was that many promising young graduates 0:gradu 0:ates were lost through emigration 
 to the united states where prospects for careers in medical science were greater 4 the policies and practices established during 
 the early years of the associate committee and the division of medical research shaped the growth of medical research unlike 
 its counterparts in the united states and britain which created central laboratories the canadian committee 0:commit 0:tee chose to develop 
 a system of support that was entirely extramural as a result medical research was characterized by a particularly close connection 
 with medical schools the committee also actively promoted 0:pro 0:moted the development of centres of research outside of the older 
 more established institutions in central canada its hope was to have medical research develop on a more even basis across 
 the country 5 in 19 16 the national research council of canada was created to advise the government and to 
 promote industrial research one of its first actions was to set up a system of studentships and fellowships to support 
 post graduate studies in the sciences and a set of grantsin aid 0:grants 0:in 0:aid for established investigators yves gingras 
 credits the postgraduate 0:post 0:graduate support program with the institutionalization of the scientific research capacity of universities these awards were 
 made primarily to students in physics and chemistry during its first twenty two years the nrc did not accept responsibility 
 for medical research in any general way though it supported important work on specific projects most notably the study of 
 tuberculosis this was the case despite the fact that the first chairman of the nrc was collip s mentor 0:men 
 0:tor biochemist a b macallum 6 
 j b collip 150 canadian medical scientists in the early decades of the century had little in the way of 
 financial support from their home institutions by 1920 both mcgill and the university of toronto the only two universities 0:univer 
 0:sities with fully developed graduate programs had begun to set aside university funds to support research other sources were available 
 as well for example proceeds from the sale of sera and antitoxins by the university of toronto s connaught antitoxin 
 laboratories were put towards research by 1920 the connaught research fund had amassed over 100 000 7 it was the 
 exception to be able to generate funds for medical research from patent royalties the royalties that banting best and collip 
 shared with the general research fund of the university of toronto garnered an average of over 180 000 a year 
 during the 19305 constituting one of the largest pools of money in support of medical science in canada the insulin 
 proceeds had been a very secure and unusually bountiful base from which collip had been able to launch the rest 
 of his research career another legacy of the insulin discovery was the banting research foundation 0:foun 0:dation which provided grants 
 and fellowships to medical investigators as well american philanthropic foundations such as the rockefeller foundation and the carnegie corporation funnelled 
 millions of dollars into medical education and research in this country 8 in 1936 when banting was asked to serve 
 on the national research council he agreed to do so on the condition that medical research be funded on the 
 same basis as the other sciences in november of that year banting worked with nrc president a g l mcnaughton 
 to draft a proposal for the organization of medical research their chief recommendation was the establishment of an associate committee 
 on medical research and their vision of its functions indicates that they favoured vigorous government involvement in research they argued 
 that while a considerable amount of work was being conducted some of it of great merit full value was not 
 being obtained because no central body was available to coordinate the activities they felt that such a body could survey 
 the field ensure that investigations were assigned 0:as 0:signed to those who were best qualified and equipped to carry them 
 out and correlate the results obtained banting and mcnaughton suggested 0:sug 0:gested that 7 500 be made available for the 
 preliminary organization of the committee during the early stages of planning they assumed that the main function of the committee 
 would be one of correlating rather than funding research general mcnaughton expressed the opinion that while no provision had yet 
 been made for the financial support of the committee his experience had been that funds were always forthcoming when the 
 needs were properly established and adequately 0:ad 0:equately presented 9 
 the rise of public funding 1938 1968 151 banting and mcnaughton then solicited the opinions of the canadian 0:cana 0:dian 
 medical association cma the royal college of physicians and surgeons and the federal government s department of pensions and national 
 health the response was largely positive with many looking towards the british medical research council as a model the members 
 0:mem 0:bers of the cma executive demonstrated an overwhelming opinion in favour of the idea of the committee and a 
 fervent hope that this would the first step toward the establishment of a medical research council for canada similar in 
 scope and function to the medical research 0:re 0:search council of the united kingdom r e wodehouse deputy minister 0:min 
 0:ister of the department of pensions and national health was even more vigorous in his support in private conversation mcnaughton 
 noted that wodehouse advocated organizing a separate council immediately 0:imme 0:diately rather than proceeding through intermediate stages furthermore 0:further 0:more 
 in place of the rather modest budget suggested by banting and mcnaughton he was in favour of asking for at 
 least 50 000 to 100 000 for the first year mcnaughton and cma representatives however opted for more a more 
 cautious strategy as they felt that the new organization had to gain the confidence of the medical profession and that 
 this was best achieved through a more gradual approach 10 although positive responses predominated researchers were not uniformly 0:uni 0:formly 
 enthusiastic j g fitzgerald director of both the university of toronto school of hygiene and connaught laboratories shared his reservations 
 about the proposal he was concerned that there were already 0:al 0:ready too many associations for organizing research and that 
 the small number of investigators in the country were already spending too much of their time at meetings and looking 
 after administrative details and not enough engaged in research 11 in february of the following year mcnaughton followed up on 
 this consultation by convening a general conference of representatives of every 0:ev 0:ery institution and organization across the country with 
 an interest in medical research universities with departments or faculties of medicine universities with pre medical courses research institutions outside 
 universities 0:uni 0:versities provincial departments of health and national organizations concerned with medicine the task of the conference was to 
 nominate the personnel and outline the scope and duties of the committee t h leggett president of the cma expressed 
 his objectives of securing greater funds for research and encouraging younger workers 11 by this date wodehouse had come to 
 agree that the interests of the medical profession would be served best by not making an attempt to set up 
 an independent council immediately nevertheless at the conference 0:confer 0:ence he continued to express concern about having the medical research 
 0:re 0:search body tied to the nrc saying he was speaking not in his official 
 j b collip 152 capacity but as a medical man with medical man s interests he suggested 0:sug 0:gested that 
 these interests could possibly be jeopardized unknowingly by people whose intentions were of the best while he expressed friendly feelings 
 towards the nrc he believed that it would be preferable 0:prefera 0:ble for the proposed organization to be autonomous just 
 as its counterparts 0:coun 0:terparts were in england the united states south africa australia and france mcnaughton hastened to assure 
 him that the nrc considered 0:consid 0:ered the creation of the committee to be only a preliminary measure and that 
 when an autonomous council became necessary the nrc would give it every assistance l 3 representatives from across canada reported 
 on the work being conducted at their institutions the primary theme that emerged from their presentations was the pressing need 
 for funds at the close of the session banting described his vision of medical research research could no longer be 
 regarded as a luxury that might be run on the charity 0:char 0:ity of private benefactors but as an enterprise 
 of national importance deserving of governmental support i think we are all surprised at the scope and amount of medical 
 research that is actually being carried on in canada medical research in canada is at the critical 0:criti 0:cal stage 
 for the most part it has been carried on by wealthy people in this day of high taxation it is 
 becoming increasingly difficult to obtain funds from individuals i believe that this discussion that we have had today is extremely 
 important inasmuch as it is passing on to the government the responsibility for medical research today will go down in 
 our history as marking an epoch we have taken a step in the right direction 14 delegates debated a number 
 of questions such as how to determine the relative support that should go to laboratory and clinical research whether support 
 should be directed towards established centres or lessdeveloped 0:less 0:developed ones and whether to create central laboratories or to promote 
 0:pro 0:mote research at existing institutions the report of the conference concluded with the recommendation that the nrc create an 
 associate committee with terms of reference very much like those banting and mcnaughton had drawn up a to receive suggestions 
 for requirements in respect of medical research and in matters related thereto b to consider by whom the investigations required 
 can best be carried out and to make proposals accordingly c to correlate the information when secured and to make 
 it available to those concerned d to do such other things as the committee may deem advisable to promote medical 
 research in canada ls 
 the rise of public funding 193 8 1968 153 the associate committee on medical research in 1938 the associate committee 
 on medical research was created with banting as its chair collip was appointed to the committee soon after the first 
 act of the associate committee was to conduct a survey of the existing facilities for medical research banting accompanied by 
 chester stewart the assistant secretary of the committee travelled across the country making personal visits to every medical school and 
 major hospital to the pre medical departments of those universities with no medical school and to provincial laboratories of the 
 departments 0:depart 0:ments of public health they met and interviewed some three hundred workers including those in collip s laboratory 
 at mcgill banting concluded 0:con 0:cluded not surprisingly that the principal centres of research were at medical schools most notably 
 at toronto and mcgill he was impressed 0:im 0:pressed that outstanding research was being carried out by collip and selye 
 at mcgill and by wilder penfield at the montreal neurological institute he also made note of the work of a 
 t cameron and bruce chown at the university of manitoba banting remarked that a promising number of more junior investigators 
 0:investiga 0:tors across the country displayed an interest in research but were hampered 0:ham 0:pered by their huge teaching loads 
 and the shortage of funds for technical assistance and equipment this type of situation was certainly one with which collip 
 was familiar recalling his early days in edmonton 0:edmon 0:ton banting and stewart concluded that there was a great need 
 for funds to encourage students to take up research training banting noted for example that the university of alberta medical 
 school was more fortunate than many others he had visited because it had a larger number of full time professional 
 members on staff three each in the departments of anatomy bacteriology biochemistry and physiology and two in pathology laboratory space 
 and other facilities were very good and those in the department of biochemistry were outstanding probably as a result of 
 collip s tenure there however a number of the faculty mentioned that their greatest need was the provision of scholarships 
 and bursaries to keep promising students in research work the few students who were engaged in research had to pay 
 for their own supplies and equipment on top of paying tuition collip had experienced regional disparities in the course of 
 his career having worked at the top two centres of medical research in canada but also at a struggling young 
 institution these differences emerged as a theme in banting s survey because of the lack of funds and facilities the 
 vast majority of graduates of maritime and western canadian universities had to leave for post graduate training in toronto 0:to 
 0:ronto and montreal or in the united states and britain after their 
 j b collip 154 training was complete few returned to the maritimes or the west because 0:be 0:cause not many 
 academic posts were available researchers in these regions 0:re 0:gions experienced intellectual isolation from others working in their fields they 
 suggested that travelling fellowships would be helpful in overcoming this difficulty collip had of course been preoccupied with the expense 
 of travel while at alberta banting also gained some support for the idea of establishing a research 0:re 0:search journal 
 two medical journals existed at that time the canadian journal of public health founded in 1910 and the canadian medical 
 association journal founded in 191 1 both emphasized subjects more closely related to clinical practice than to investigation banting s 
 canada wide consultation may have stimulated interest in research among students and faculty across the country g h ettinger a 
 member of the first associate committee commented that in the small centres particularly he was welcomed almost as a messiah 
 tired teachers had their hopes for assistance reawakened young men and women became ardent disciples 16 the budget of the 
 associate committee was 53 000 for its first year 25 000 of which was committed to the research program in 
 tuberculosis the remainder was distributed as small grants in aid to researchers who had submitted requests for assistance the response 
 in the first year was great with requests for over 125 000 banting wrote to penfield there has thus been 
 an awakening on the part of research workers which we must do our best to assist 17 the pattern of 
 providing extramural support for university research rather than establishing central laboratories was set early on in the work of the 
 committee more by default than by deliberate policy the committee had quite a modest budget and given this fact its 
 members acted on mcnaughton s suggestion that they should first endeavour to make the best use of existing facilities a 
 g fleming dean of medicine 0:med 0:icine at mcgill agreed that this approach was in keeping with the will of 
 representatives at the organizational meeting the feeling of the conference was for men rather than for bricks and mortar this 
 practice 0:prac 0:tice contrasted with the model set by the british medical research council which employed staff at a central 
 research institution and at its research units at medical schools the americans also had an extensive 0:exten 0:sive intramural program 
 of research at the national institutes of health 18 the plans for the committee were interrupted the following year with 
 the outbreak of war more than in any previous conflict science assumed a central position in all aspects of warfare 
 the nrc became the focus of scientific activities to support the war effort in canada the staff and budget of 
 the council increased enormously within 
 the rise of public funding 1938 1968 155 months of the outbreak of hostilities by 1943 the budget was five 
 times its prewar size 19 the medical research arm was dramatically changed as well the associate 0:as 0:sociate committee placed 
 its services at the disposal of the government and acted to investigate and advise on research problems related to the 
 health of military and civilian populations by 1942 much of the peacetime 0:peace 0:time research program of the committee had 
 been suspended in favour of work to support the war effort at university laboratories across the country fundamental research and 
 most graduate training was put aside three additional associate committees were created one to deal with medical research in each 
 of the three branches of the armed services banting best and collip the surviving members of the insulin team served 
 as leaders of canadian medical research each was associated with one of the wartime committees banting chaired the committee on 
 aviation medical research and he and his department at toronto were heavily involved in studies in this area best entered 
 the naval service and was named chair of the naval medical research associate committee during the war he carried out 
 research on seasickness collip was attached 0:at 0:tached to the army medical research associate committee if there was any continued 
 animosity among the three men their separate roles and responsibilities no doubt helped to avert any problems 20 in september 
 1939 collip was made vice chairman of the main medical 0:med 0:ical research committee under banting and he took over 
 meetings during 0:dur 0:ing banting s frequent absences banting and i m rabinowitch visited britain in december and january to 
 establish a liaison with the british medical research council in its war work the british initially underestimated 0:under 0:estimated the 
 research capabilities of the canadian scientific community 0:com 0:munity but the canadians gradually demonstrated their ability to contribute to the 
 allied cause and to carry out work on important projects independently banting s special interest was in aviation medicine and 
 he and his associates 0:as 0:sociates explored problems experienced by airmen william franks of banting s laboratory developed the first 
 anti g suit to allow pilots to withstand the high gravity forces they faced in dives and turns without blacking 
 out banting was also very concerned with the threat of bacteriological 0:bacte 0:riological warfare although he could not persuade the 
 british medical research establishment to share his concern he pushed for canadian research on this subject he created the top 
 secret committee later the m 1000 committee that investigated ways of spreading disease organisms 0:organ 0:isms such as plague cholera 
 anthrax rabies and typhus to human and animal populations 21 upon banting s death in february 194 1 collip assumed 
 the chair of the associate committee on medical research with harold ettinger as 
 156 j b collip his honorary secretary collip s responsibilities were considerable since he was not only the chairman of 
 the central coordinating committee but also an ex officio member of the three wartime associate committees 0:commit 0:tees collip s 
 daughter barbara recalls that he was always very anxious about maintaining the secrecy of the many files he had to 
 study worrying 0:worry 0:ing when domestic help or even friends of his children came to the house barr and rossiter 
 observe collip more than any other man had responsibilities for and knowledge of the entire spectrum of medical 0:medi 0:cal 
 research carried out in canada during world war n collip s duties increased even further when he was appointed medical 
 0:medi 0:cal liaison officer to the united states for this purpose he was made acting lieutenant colonel in the royal 
 canadian army medical corps in 1942 and promoted to acting colonel in 1944 the liaison work required 0:re 0:quired him 
 to travel extensively and left him little time in montreal abe neufeld also left the laboratory to serve as a 
 resident liaison officer in washington 3 the three associate committees delegated a number of important wartime projects to subcommittees one 
 subcommittee was created to investigate the problems of infections e g d murray of mcgill philip h greey of toronto 
 and guilford b reed of queen s contributed studies on such subjects as gas gangrene and the use of sulphonamides 
 in the treatment of infections in may 194 1 howard florey of oxford visited north america meeting with collip at 
 mcgill and greey in toronto 0:to 0:ronto to establish arrangements for the large scale production of penicillin 0:peni 0:cillin probably 
 the most important medical development of the war greey and colin c lucas of toronto initiated a pilot plant for 
 the production 0:pro 0:duction of penicillin the director general of the army medical services furnished the funds so that the 
 connaught laboratory could remodel a section of the knox college building at the university of toronto to serve as a 
 centre for manufacture ayerst mckenna and harrison in montreal was also invited to participate and later a third firm was 
 added so that by the end of the war canadian companies were producing 20 billion units of penicillin a month 
 enough to meet all canadian needs 24 a subcommittee on shock and blood substitutes involved researchers at toronto and mcgill 
 collip and denstedt explored the preservation of whole blood while best s group at toronto experimented with methods of preparing 
 dried blood serum collip noble selye and j s l browne at mcgill and r a cleghorn at the banting 
 institute investigated 0:in 0:vestigated the relation of shock to the adrenal cortex this area of research 0:re 0:search attracted a 
 great deal of attention because of the hope held by investigators that adrenocortical hormones could help pilots deal with shock 
 and fatigue additional impetus was given by a secret report that 
 the rise of public funding 1938 1968 157 suggested that the enemy was giving top priority to studying the use 
 of adrenal hormones in commando training the canadian researchers concluded however that cortical extracts could not prevent or alleviate 0:allevi 
 0:ate shock in the united states edward kendall had prepared small quantities of several different cortical extracts by the mid 
 19 30s although the war focused scientific attention on these compounds interest 0:in 0:terest waned when it seemed that one 
 of them compound a was ineffective 0:inef 0:fective in treating shock nevertheless kendall persisted in trying to reproduce the closely 
 related compound e even though there was little clinical interest in it the therapeutic value of the drug was established 
 after the war in 1949 when philip hench demonstrated that compound 0:com 0:pound e cortisone was useful in treating rheumatoid 
 arthritis 5 wilder penfield chaired a third subcommittee on surgery that set up regional groups at mcgill and the university 
 of montreal toronto london and winnipeg surgical specialists conducted research on thermal 0:ther 0:mal burns orthopaedic surgery traumatic injuries of 
 the nervous system 0:sys 0:tem radiology plastic surgery and wound infections a fourth subcommittee dealt with the industrial health problems 
 created 0:cre 0:ated on the home front these investigators examined the physiological and psychological problems of fatigue and inadequate nutrition 
 especially 0:espe 0:cially in the women who had moved into the war plants studies were also made of nutrition in 
 civilian and military populations 16 after banting s death collip reconstituted the committee on bacteriological 0:bacterio 0:logical warfare under the 
 chairmanship of e g d murray murray guilford 0:guil 0:ford reed and charles mitchell of the department of agriculture were 
 active in studying bacteriological weapons from both a defensive and an offensive perspective the m 1000 committee established a plant 
 for the mass production of anthrax on grosse ile in the st lawrence the canadian 0:cana 0:dian project was abandoned 
 later when the americans developed the capability 0:ca 0:pability of producing anthrax in a safer and more efficient manner some 
 medical scientists such as philip greey were uneasy about being involved 0:in 0:volved in bacteriological warfare greey was more prepared 
 to throw himself into the work on the production of penicillin others however were confident that studying and producing biological 
 weapons was an appropriate response to a real wartime threat 27 nrc president c j mackenzie remembered some may differ 
 but i would not have thought of collip as primarily a good conventional administrator i don t think he would 
 have made an outstanding 0:outstand 0:ing president of a university or a corporation for as you know his mind worked 
 very fast and because he was impatient he never developed the art of patient exposition he was always miles ahead 
 of his words and the current discussion 
 158 j b collip he was not particularly articulate in formal meetings but nevertheless in my opinion and i used 
 to attend most medical meetings at n r c during the war out of genuine interest he was a good 
 chairman he was always courteous fair and rarely showed the impatience i often thought he felt in my opinion the 
 key to collip s success in his role as head of n r c s medical 0:medi 0:cal activities was 
 his pre eminent scientific talents and standing as a research scientist 0:sci 0:entist his reputation as a medical scientist not 
 only made his task as chairman of committees easier but of greater and to me of prime importance his knowledge 
 and devotion to all medical research meant that he knew all the research workers in canada and had a sound 
 appreciation of the quality of their work this meant that when the rapid expansion of war work was taking place 
 collip knew who were the proper men to head the innumerable research groups that were being set up and as 
 chairman he had the power to have them so placed if one of the essential tests of a good administrator 
 is the insight to select the best men for the key positions involved and then give them responsibility with only 
 the most general review of objectives reached then collip s contribution as an administrator during the war must be rated 
 high 18 the war had turned investigators attention away from fundamental research to a narrow range of practical problems the 
 emergency situation 0:situ 0:ation also forced a close collaboration and coordination among academic 0:aca 0:demic researchers and industrial scientists the 
 mass production of penicillin was one major achievement that emerged from this intense cooperative atmosphere yet while key developments in 
 some fields were accelerated many other fields lay neglected as was the case with collip it could prove difficult for 
 researchers to pick up the pieces of peacetime research programs when the war came to a close the legacy of 
 the wartime committees was the creation of a permanent 0:perma 0:nent institutional structure for the funding and coordination of medical 
 research in canada the war had provided an opportunity for proponents 0:propo 0:nents of research to demonstrate the utility of 
 medical science and to demand a great increase in funding also a great number of junior personnel 0:per 0:sonnel had 
 been brought into scientific work through war research projects many of them remained on after the war some 120 scientific 
 publications were supported by grants made between 1938 and 1946 at the close of the war the associate committee members 
 sought to consolidate these gains by arguing that the same sum that had been spent by all four medical research 
 associate committees during the war would be required for post war activities one of the tasks they faced was to 
 place personnel returning from military service at the urging of wilder penfield the associate committee on medical research initiated 0:initi 
 0:ated a system of graduate fellowships to provide research opportunities for medical officers returning to civilian life 19 
 the rise of public funding 1938 1968 159 the committee also took up p h t thorlackson s recommendation that 
 a western regional group be established to stimulate research in the four western provinces at these annual meetings the researchers 
 from the four western universities british columbia alberta saskatchewan and manitoba gathered at one of their institutions to see one 
 another s laboratories and to present papers in an informal setting this helped to alleviate the problems of isolation experienced 
 by the westerners and saved the expense of travelling to larger centres in central canada collip and ettinger travelled out 
 to the first meeting bringing a bit of the east to the west collip s interest in the west had 
 endured since his days in edmonton and he was a strong supporter of these initiatives 3o at this juncture the 
 committee seriously debated the question of establishing 0:es 0:tablishing an independent medical research council one of the chief concerns was 
 that a separate medical research council would likely be made responsible to an existing ministry of the federal government rather 
 than to a committee of the cabinet as was the nrc after considerable 0:con 0:siderable discussion the committee opted instead 
 for the more cautious approach of gradual evolution within the nrc the associate committee 0:commit 0:tee became the more autonomous 
 division of medical research taking it one step closer to its goal of independence 3 the division of medical research 
 collip was made the first director of the new division and his friend harold ettinger was made assistant director the 
 division started its work in 1946 with a budget of 200 000 almost a fourfold increase over the budget of 
 the associate committee when it started in 1938 the division of medical research differed from other divisions in the nrc 
 in that its program was entirely extramural no central laboratories 0:laborato 0:ries were built throughout his tenure collip strongly opposed 
 the establishment 0:es 0:tablishment of a central research facility choosing instead to vigorously extend the program of grants and fellowships 
 to researchers at existing institutions 32 in 1948 the privy council commissioned a second national survey conducted again by chester 
 stewart this time with morley whillans of the defence research board and ralph macaulay of the department of national health 
 and welfare in the ten years since the last survey there had been a sizable increase in the number of 
 junior faculty the many new investigators who had been brought into medical research through wartime work had contributed their numbers 
 to a rapid postwar 0:post 0:war expansion of the field in its report the privy council s committee noted that 
 it could now count 955 persons in medical research at universities 278 technicians 315 graduate students and 311 part time 
 
 160 j b collip and 51 full time researchers the committee also found an increased enthusiasm for research among those 
 it surveyed despite the continuing 0:continu 0:ing problems of a shortage of funds crowded conditions and heavy teaching loads stewart 
 and his colleagues noted that as before most research was being conducted in medical schools university departments 0:depart 0:ments and 
 special institutes some research work was also carried out in pharmaceutical houses hospitals and institutions apart from medical 0:medi 0:cal 
 schools in provincial and federal health laboratories and by the department of national defence the growing body of canadian scientific 
 studies had also warranted the creation of new research journals 0:jour 0:nals the revue canadienne de biologic had been established 
 in 1942 through the work of the associate committee on medical research the nrc also authorized a medical research section 
 in the canadian journal of research section e in 1944 collip served as the editor of this journal and of 
 its successors the canadian journal of medical sciences 1951 53 and the canadian journal of biochemistry and physiology 1954 56 
 for a total of twelve years 33 the report identified three especially pressing needs 1 senior research 0:re 0:search appointments 
 that would provide positions for those who might otherwise have to go into clinical practice or to other countries 2 
 the assurance of continuity in research and 3 easier methods of administering 0:adminis 0:tering grants to meet these needs the 
 division developed an expanded program of extramural grants to university scientists these grants were used to stimulate research provide for 
 travel opportunities create university appointments and train young graduates the division of medical research of the 1950s was much less 
 interventionist 0:inter 0:ventionist than banting might have envisioned it being in 1938 the advisory committee chose not to direct resources 
 to particular research problems instead it selected projects from the applications submitted by interested investigators the fellowship program was aimed 
 at assisting 0:as 0:sisting ex servicemen who sought graduate training to prepare for the examinations of the royal college of 
 physicians and surgeons senior research fellowships were created for graduates in medicine who were preparing for careers in research by 
 1954 serious concern arose about the pressing need to provide talented young investigators with the opportunity 0:op 0:portunity to devote 
 themselves entirely to research the senior research fellowships were replaced in 1955 by medical research associateships that served to establish 
 university appointments for medical scientists with salaries like those of the research officers at nrc institutions the universities provided the 
 appointments while the nrc paid the salaries for these associates 34 the division members further acknowledged the growing trend towards 
 0:to 0:wards collaborative research by instituting a new type of award known 
 the rise of public funding 193 8 1968 161 as the consolidated grant this grant was made to a laboratory 
 group as a whole rather than being split into a number of grants in aid to individuals the consolidated grant 
 provided easier administration as well as longer term support than had been previously available collip 0:col 0:lip certainly felt the 
 need for this type of grant in his own case as the head of a large group of researchers at 
 the university of western ontario 0:on 0:tario he was quite apprehensive about building up the department often 0:of 0:ten fearful 
 for the security of his associates if funding were to be cut collip was among the first recipients of these 
 grants along with best penfield and j s l browne new sources of research funding as before medical research had 
 a base of support in general university funds but during this period in addition to the nrc s division of 
 medical 0:med 0:ical research a number of other new sources became available during the postwar years several voluntary societies for 
 the study of special diseases were formed notably the national cancer institute and the canadian arthritis and rheumatism society they 
 and philanthropic foundations pharmaceutical firms and private gifts brought additional funds to research an interesting case of a privately funded 
 research institution was the w p caven research foundation 1949 1974 one of canada s first independent research facilities this 
 small clinical research laboratory created for toronto surgeon dr gordon murray by his supporters ultimately 0:ulti 0:mately failed in its 
 attempt to cultivate medical research outside an academic 0:ac 0:ademic setting shelley mckellar argues than the foundation lacking the status 
 and resources of a university setting had difficulty attracting high calibre researchers moreover murray failed to participate in the system 
 of grantsmanship that was becoming the norm during this period coming as he did from a generation of investigators who 
 expected to receive support for their professional standing or past accomplishments 0:ac 0:complishments rather than their ability to write detailed 
 research proposals 0:pro 0:posals and reports 36 apart from through the division of medical research governmental support was also channelled 
 through the defence research board and the department of national health and welfare in 1948 the federal government instituted public 
 health grants to support research in the field of public health in order to coordinate the activities of these many 
 granting agencies ad hoc conferences were held to review applications 0:appli 0:cations and determine the appropriate body to which they 
 should be routed the division of medical research took a coordinating role in these activities aiding the national cancer institute 
 and the canadian 
 162 j b collip arthritis and rheumatism society by reviewing and making recommendations 0:recom 0:mendations on their applications for research 
 grants and fellowships s7 nrc president e w c steacie who took office in 1952 was himself an academic chemist 
 and a strong advocate of basic research furthermore 0:further 0:more he held the conviction that fundamental work was best carried 
 out primarily at universities while there was a strong rivalry between the medical arm of the nrc and the other 
 governmental bodies that supported medical research these agencies gradually began to differentiate 0:differen 0:tiate their roles collip displayed his own 
 bias towards basic research when he argued personally i am in favour of an expansion of clinical research by competent 
 workers but if our funds are to be limited i feel sure that we will get the best value for 
 the money expended if we use most if not all of it in supporting fundamental work in the basic medical 
 0:med 0:ical sciences 3b over time the nrc medical research division moved towards the support of fundamental research while the 
 department of veterans affairs and the public health research fund supplied funds for clinical studies in such fields as psychiatry 
 obstetrics paediatrics and epidemiology 39 chester stewart notes that there was considerable competition for federal funds between the nrc s 
 division of medical research and the department of health and welfare s national health research grants during the 1950s the 
 national health grants grew at an unprecedented 0:un 0:precedented rate and stewart argues that this was particularly galling 0:gall 0:ing 
 to the pre clinical scientists 40 by 1955 these grants had a budget of 1 785 000 more than a 
 million dollars greater than that of the nrc division 41 developing research on a national basis the idea of an 
 independent medical research council continued to be debated through these years ray farquharson of the university of toronto discussed the 
 idea with steacie in 1954 as before political questions about funds and authority continued to be obstacles farquharson reported to 
 collip we talked about the possibility of developing a separate medical research council for which so many of our colleagues 
 are now pressing thinking that it would have disposal of all the federal funds for medical research the president confirms 
 my fears that it would be difficult to acquire the large sums now disposed 0:dis 0:posed of by the department 
 of health and welfare and further that a medical research council would almost certainly have to report to the minister 
 of health and welfare it could hardly be hoped that a medical research council would be so fortunate as to 
 be left to develop its policies without political 
 the rise of public funding 1938 1968 163 pressure i think that it is much better for medical research to 
 continue to build as part of the national research council 42 another part of the division s work was the 
 distribution of hormone products that were available only in limited quantities after philip hench and edward kendall reported the effect 
 of cortisone on rheumatoid 0:rheuma 0:toid arthritis in 1949 many scientists were eager to explore cortisone s effects on this 
 and other diseases this interest extended to adrenocorticotrophic 0:adrenocorti 0:cotrophic hormone acth the pituitary hormone that stimulates the adrenal glands 
 to produce cortisone this project was particularly close to collip s heart since he was the one who had successfully 
 produced the first active preparation of acth years before the division oversaw the canadian production and distribution of cortisone and 
 acth for research purposes after 1953 the division also coordinated the supply of growth hormone 43 the members of the 
 division of medical research had to deal with the difficult question of whether to channel support to institutions that were 
 already well established or to distribute the funds more widely and promote the growth of new research centres here practice 
 rather than explicit policy became important ettinger and collip worked closely in evaluating the applications as they came in ettinger 
 would compare the referees reports against the money available in the budget and adjust the prospective grants to fit years 
 later chester stewart praised these early officers for having the wisdom to deviate from their own rules by encouraging beginners 
 and strengthening weak departments 0:de 0:partments he noted for example that officers provided such special treatment and leniency as sending 
 constructive comments on grant applications and allowing applicants the opportunity to revise their proposals stewart argues that these actions allowed 
 medical research to develop on a national basis rather than only at those institutions that were already strong 44 collip 
 attracted some criticism for not pushing hard enough to strengthen the division s position his colleagues ettinger and noble speculate 
 that he may have been too timid about trying to raise the division s 0:di 0:vision 0:s budget they suggest 
 that this may have been because collip had personal difficulties in working with the nrc presidents c j mackenzie who 
 they say had the ability to overwhelm him and ned steacie who they believe collip felt was hostile to him 
 this lack of assertiveness seems surprising in light of collip s forceful and successful campaigns for financial compensation in his 
 own academic career 4s in 1957 the division of medical research reached the final stage of its separation from the 
 nrc collip had favoured the creation of an 
 j b collip 164 independent medical research council but this was not to happen during 0:dur 0:ing his tenure that 
 year at the age of sixty five he retired from the directorship 0:di 0:rectorship and was succeeded by ray farquharson 
 the initiative for the move to full independence came from the association of canadian medical colleges which was made up 
 of the deans of the medical schools they expressed the concern that the federal funds available for research were insufficient 
 to meet the requirements of a field that was now rapidly growing ettinger stated the case strongly there is a 
 great unrest in the medical research laboratories of universities because it is believed that this total sum 5 535 000 
 is inadequate and that the multiplicity of sources makes administration awkward and continuity uncertain 46 a number of factors contributed 
 to the greatly increased need for research 0:re 0:search support first there had been a sudden expansion of scientific programs 
 in the universities in the postwar period second two new medical schools had been established the first at the university 
 of ottawa and the second at the university of british columbia the program at the university of saskatchewan had also 
 been expanded to four years the nature of research was changing too requiring more expensive research equipment and more extensive 
 facilities finally there had been a great expansion in the scope of medical science itself the deans resolved to ask 
 the prime minister to increase the funds by at least 500 000 a third study was commissioned at this time 
 ray farquharson headed up the special committee to review the extramural support of medical research the committee collected and evaluated 
 written submissions 0:sub 0:missions by and interviews with representatives of all canadian institutions 0:institu 0:tions associated with medical research as 
 well it gathered comparative statements from the united states the united kingdom australia and sweden nrc medical research support amounted 
 to almost one and a half million dollars and the department of national health and welfare and the defence research 
 board added another two and a half million this figure does not include the general university funds provided by the 
 provincial governments in comparison the u s national institutes of health spent 108 million on medical research or approximately twice 
 as much as a percentage of its gross national product the review committee 0:com 0:mittee concluded that funding had not 
 kept pace with the growth in research it found grave inadequacies in the grants and fellowships programs 0:pro 0:grams in 
 the salaries of scientific staff in fluid funds in medical schools and in the construction of research facilities the committee 
 recommended 0:recom 0:mended that longer term grants be made to ensure continuity of research and that greater flexibility be permitted 
 in the use of funds to allow researchers 0:re 0:searchers to pursue long term g0a15 47 
 the rise of public funding 1938 1968 165 the farquharson committee commended the nrc division s decision to channel its 
 resources through the universities and teaching hospitals rather than to establish central laboratories it argued that medical research 0:re 0:search 
 is unique in that it requires a close association with medical schools to reach its full development the committee also 
 regarded this association as crucial for the recruitment and training of young investigators 0:investi 0:gators and for stimulating teaching 4b 
 as had been originally planned the medical research arm of the nrc had been gaining increased funding and autonomy within 
 the council over the twenty years since its inception the farquharson committee concluded that this development was now complete the 
 time has come to take the final step and establish an independent medical research 0:re 0:search council this opinion is 
 shared by virtually all medical research workers in canada and those consulted in other countries 49 the review committee argued 
 that canadian medical research had grown tremendously and that it should now be directed by a body directly reporting to 
 the privy council through its committee on scientific and industrial research rather than through a department of government in i960 
 the medical research council of canada mrc was established the transition however was complicated by a change in government and 
 the final legislation was not passed until 1968 thus for several years the mrc remained within the orbit of the 
 nrc and obtained its funding through joint grants laying the foundations the policies and practices established by the associate committee 
 and the division of medical research assisted the growth of medical research 0:re 0:search and shaped its institutions in the 
 postwar period change was brought about through a cautious evolutionary approach the division 0:divi 0:sion consolidated the gains achieved by 
 the wartime associate committees 0:commit 0:tees and was effective in using these advances to meet the gravest needs of the 
 research enterprise the funding of established researchers the training of students the provision of travel grants and the establishment 0:establish 
 0:ment of academic posts because of financial constraints and the relatively 0:rela 0:tively small size of the research community in 
 canada the program of the associate committee and division of medical research was entirely 0:en 0:tirely extramural funds were channelled 
 to universities and teaching hospitals to help create a system in which medical research was closely tied with medical education 
 the associate committee and the division also promoted the growth of research on a truly national basis they actively developed 
 policies and practices that stimulated research not only in the established centres but also across the country as head of 
 
 166 j b collip the nrc s medical research arm for sixteen years collip brought his own experience as well 
 as his own sympathies to bear on the development 0:develop 0:ment of research policy as one of the few who 
 had been able to succeed 0:suc 0:ceed in the period of private funding he was well placed to guide canadian 
 medical research into a new era of government support and coordination cj mackenzie would later evaluate collip s contribution while 
 collip s outstanding talent undoubtedly lay in the field of fundamental research i think his leadership in the field of 
 organized support of medical research 0:re 0:search during those 19 years should not be minimized as it was in the 
 war and post war years that the foundations were layed sic for the sane rapid and admirable 0:ad 0:mirable way 
 in which large scale medical research has developed in canada of course collip was not wholly responsible as the growth 
 was influenced by the active contribution of a substantial number of medical workers including 0:in 0:cluding people like banting duncan 
 graham best hurst brown ettinger and farquharson who headed research organizations of n r c in war and peace as 
 well as by scores of research men and officers in universities other departments 0:depart 0:ments and organizations but after all 
 collip was the active director of n r c medical research during those formative years and 19 years of successful 
 building 0:build 0:ing is a monument to any director 50 
 8 dean of medicine 1947 1965 it seems in retrospect he was always arriving or departing always in a hurry 
 1 c j mackenzie to f g macintosh 19 october 1965 collip spent the remainder of his career in london 
 as dean of medicine at the university of western ontario 2 the postwar period was a time of active expansion 
 in the medical school at western just as it was at other medical schools across the country the size of 
 the medical class grew as did the number of graduate students an honours course in the basic medical sciences was 
 instituted collip oversaw the expansion in facilities and led the medical school in its move from its old location across 
 town to the main university campus collip was still active restless 0:rest 0:less and straining against limits as always he 
 moved abruptly and spoke quickly and he was notorious for speeding through campus and leaving his car wherever he wanted 
 the grounds staff soon learned to recognize the dean s car and were under instruction not to ticket it the 
 medical students developed a shorthand method to indicate the presence 0:pres 0:ence of the dean in their annual comedy revue 
 a spray of gravel dashed against a wall for ray and bert life changed quite dramatically their home life in 
 montreal had been relatively quiet especially during the war years when collip had been busy travelling on official business and 
 so concerned 0:con 0:cerned about keeping national secrets that he rarely had people to the house they were now responsible 
 for hosting many visitors and they opened their home to the medical class every year ray was well known for 
 the warmth and graciousness with which she welcomed guests to the many catered functions she was expected to hold as 
 the wife of the dean together they basked in the company of the young students and enjoyed taking an interest 
 in their lives to the surprise of collip s 
 168 j b collip friends and perhaps even his family he took to administrative work wholeheartedly relishing the idea of 
 leading the development of the medical school when asked about his administrative skills though tactful friends respond that collip was 
 never very keen on the details but was always blessed with good assistants it was not always easy dealing with 
 the inevitable jealousies and animosities between different factions within the medical school and within the larger community a c wallace 
 a pathologist and researcher in collip s lab recalls collip telling him that he sometimes found this sort of thing 
 difficult to take but that he regarded these challenges as something he had to beat 3 in addition to running 
 the medical school as a whole he was head of the department of medical research the department was housed in 
 a building originally intended for the department of zoology bob noble 0:no 0:ble several graduate students including ken carroll kay 
 maclean and burwell taylor three technicians hans pedersen axel andersen and rheinhold rasmussen and his long time loyal assistant arthur 
 long from edmonton days had followed collip from mcgill collip s old friend the bacteriologist e g d joburg murray 
 joined the department 0:de 0:partment after his retirement from mcgill in i960 collip was able to lure another old friend 
 abe neufeld to western as well other staff j a f stevenson r w begg and charles engle were brought 
 into the department too when collip and his staff arrived in 1947 another storey and a wing were added to 
 accommodate them the building was named the collip medical research laboratory on a typical day collip would spend the morning 
 at the dean s office 0:of 0:fice looking after his duties there but after lunch he would spend his time 
 in the laboratory he remained very interested in the activities of his junior associates although he was now clearly a 
 world renowned figure in medical research even young researchers were struck by the fact that he did not seem to 
 have the polish or the aloofness they might have expected they found him sincere in his speech natural he was 
 not one to put on airs perhaps even somewhat awkward but eminently 0:emi 0:nently approachable wallace recalls that collip would 
 often be sitting in his office with his door open reading a few articles and he could read at a 
 ferocious rate but that he would put everything down to listen 0:lis 0:ten to whatever problems were brought to him 
 and he could often solve the problem too because he knew how to attack the question where to find more 
 information or how to get more money or equipment 0:equip 0:ment he sometimes astounded his staff and students with his 
 grasp of the current literature and he did everything he could to make it possible 0:possi 0:ble for them to 
 pursue their ideas robert macbeth remembers collip as being at his best on such occasions when he discussed a research 
 problem one on one he became very animated very much alive however 0:how 
 dean of medicine 194 7 1965 169 ever collip never found his way back to the bench himself for quite 
 some time he continued to say he might like to get back to making his extracts he never did for 
 years the faithful arthur long kept his chief s equipment polished and ready for his return guarding it fiercely even 
 when everyone else in the lab was running out of glassware a monstrous new german palder still with a tremendous 
 capacity for extracting 0:ex 0:tracting huge amounts of material was especially installed for collip but stood unused 4 now that 
 collip was often busy with his work in the dean s office it was left to bob noble to set 
 the tone for the laboratory noble s easygoing 0:easy 0:going jovial style made the lab a more relaxed place than 
 it had been in its heyday at mcgill gone was the ethos that had kept the montreal 0:mon 0:treal lab 
 humming until late into the night ken carroll recalls that it sometimes seemed as though the lab at western started 
 planning for its christmas party as early as august and that plenty of effort would be devoted to organizing skits 
 and such things this did not mean that the work of the group was not stimulating and important endocrinology 0:endocrinol 
 0:ogy continued to be central to the work of the lab group but they extended 0:ex 0:tended their interests to 
 atherosclerosis cancer and synthetic steroids in 1957 bob noble and chemist charles beer isolated an alkaloid product from the periwinkle 
 plant that they named vincaleucoblastine 0:vincaleucoblas 0:tine or vinblastine this turned out to be a most important achievement vinblastine was 
 found to be a valuable treatment for leukaemia 0:leu 0:kaemia and hodgkin s disease and grew to become one of 
 the most commonly used cancer chemotherapy drugs s elder statesman throughout his career collip took a leading role in the 
 development of medical research as a profession as dean of medicine he was a member 0:mem 0:ber of the association 
 of canadian medical colleges and he served as president for one term he guided the development of the national research 
 0:re 0:search council s canadian journal of research section e in 1944 tne first canadian research journal for medical sciences 
 collip edited it and its successors until 1956 he was the first president 1936 of the canadian physiological society and 
 was the only member to serve a second term as president 1952 he was also one of the early presidents 
 0:presi 0:dents of the american association for the study of internal secretions 1925 26 counsellor of the american society of 
 biological chemists 1937 and a delegate to the league of nations committee on standardization 0:stan 0:dardization of hormones during the 
 19305 collip s achievements were recognized in later years with many honours 0:ho 0:nours and awards he received the order 
 of the british empire 1943 
 j b collip 170 and the u s medal of freedom with silver palm 1947 for his war efforts 0:ef 
 0:forts he was made a fellow of the royal society of canada 1925 and subsequently became the society s president 
 1942 43 he was also elected as fellow of the royal society of london 1933 he was awarded fellowships in 
 several clinical societies as well the american college of physicians 1930 the royal college of physicians of canada 0:can 0:ada 
 1931 the royal college of physicians of london 1938 and the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists 1947 in 1936 
 he received the flavelle medal of the royal society of canada and the f n g starr medal of the 
 canadian medical association in 1937 the cameron prize from the university of edinburgh in 1941 the charles mickle award of 
 the university of toronto and in i960 the banting medal of the american diabetes association he had twelve honorary degrees 
 conferred upon him by universities in canada britain and the united states on his sixty fifth birthday his friends colleagues 
 and former students prepared a special issue of the canadian journal of biochemistry and physiology in his honour efforts were 
 made by friends at mcgill and the university of western ontario to secure a nobel prize for him but without 
 success collip was now an elder statesman of medical research but the restless 0:rest 0:less personality and drive that had 
 brought him this far meant he could never be retiring when he reached the age of sixty five collip faced 
 mandatory retirement from his work at the national research council his daughter barbara and robert noble remember the forced retirement 
 0:retire 0:ment as something he took very hard barbara wyatt says it broke him noble and harold ettinger suggest that 
 there was some incompatibility 0:incom 0:patibility between collip and nrc president steacie and that collip was hurt at the way 
 the retirement was handled collip remained dean at western for two more years stepping down in 1 961 he retained 
 his position as head of the medical research department however and continued 0:con 0:tinued to look in on the work 
 there though by this time robert noble had gone on to the university of british columbia where he had been 
 offered the opportunity to head up his own laboratory in cancer research 0:re 0:search collip s daughter and son in 
 law recall that he seemed never really happy again after having to retire 6 still collip had the abiding support 
 and companionship of his wife and he could enjoy watching his children start families of their own margaret had recovered 
 from the worst of her grave s disease and had gone on to marry gerald mcßride barbara had studied medicine 
 at mcgill and then did a master s in endocrinology there as well this meant that she had to work 
 in her father s lab and even had to take her oral examination with her father and bob noble during 
 her studies she had met jackson wyatt a clinician from the american south who 
 dean of medicine 1947 1965 171 was doing his residency at the royal victoria hospital they married and moved to 
 rome georgia where barbara practised in geriatric medicine the collip s youngest child jack also studied medicine he married and 
 settled in edmonton practising anaesthesia in retirement bert and ray collip continued to be inseparable receiving 0:re 0:ceiving visits from 
 their children and many grandchildren margaret s five barbara s five and jack s four of which one was born 
 only after bert collip s death they loved making impromptu journeys as well on one trip they telegraphed barbara and 
 c j wyatt from chattanooga 0:chatta 0:nooga announcing only we ll be there in an hour in june 1965 bert 
 and ray made another one of their famous cross country drives to attend 0:at 0:tend the meeting of the royal 
 society in vancouver on the way they stopped in edmonton to visit with their son jack in vancouver they met 
 with long time friend bob noble and his wife the collips drove back east putting their car on the ferry 
 at thunder bay and returning safely to london two days later bert collip suffered a stroke in his later years 
 he had grown more stout and had developed dangerously high blood pressure he was admitted to the university hospital where 
 he died quietly at the age of seventy two collip s funeral was an august affair with a hundred honorary 
 pallbearers 0:pall 0:bearers from all over canada and the united states ray his constant companion in life bravely faced the 
 funeral and a large reception at her home later in the evening she stoically watched the broadcast of the burial 
 ceremony on television tributes poured in from colleagues and friends everywhere celebrating her husband s remarkable achievements 
 conclusion the transformation of the research enterprise in the early decades of the twentieth century medical research in canada was 
 the pursuit of an exceptional few by mid century it had burgeoned into a systematic large scale enterprise involving teams 
 of professional scientists and dozens of laboratories in universities government 0:gov 0:ernment and industry j b collip driven devoted and 
 marvellously skilled in drawing biological gold from dross was a noteworthy part of this change his story gives us some 
 insight into the forces that transformed the landscape of canadian medical research collip s life and scientific work stretched across 
 a key period in the development of medical research in canada his career was an exceptional 0:excep 0:tional one and 
 yet his varied experiences of scientific life reflect many facets of canadian medical research during its formative years yves gingras 
 developed an analytic model to study the formation of scientific communities and has applied it to the development of physics 
 the first scientific community to be constituted in canada the first phase he identifies is the emergence of research practice 
 the second is the institutionalization of research whereby structures are set up to allow the production of knowledge and the 
 reproduction of the next generation 0:genera 0:tion of scientists the final phase is the creation of a social identity through 
 the establishment of research journals and scientific societies 1 in the canadian medical research community the first phase of this 
 development was initiated by pioneers like robert ramsay wright and a b macallum who created an honours stream in biochemistry 
 and physiology that was dedicated to the pursuit of original investigation these pioneers produced collip s generation of investigators those 
 of 
 conclusion 173 the second phase who were firmly imbued with the research ideal and fully expected that research was to 
 be a component of their academic careers this generation reshaped universities in its demand to secure institutional conditions that would 
 favour research the challenges that collip faced characterized this stage of development to set up the structures conducive to research 
 and to train students the final phase of development the creation of a social identity began with the creation 0:cre 
 0:ation of the canadian physiological society in 1934 35 was nurtured by the creation of a canadian research journal for 
 medical science in 1944 but only fully flowered in the 1950s with the creation of the canadian federation of biological 
 societies a group that included biochemical 0:bio 0:chemical physiological anatomical and pharmacological scientists as a student of research pioneer macallum 
 collip was privileged to have his undergraduate and graduate education at the one university in canada where he could get 
 rigorous training in original research in biochemistry he was among the early group of canadians able to earn a phd 
 in this country because of the expansion of existing universities and the creation of new universities in the west scientists 
 of his generation 0:gener 0:ation were able to acquire academic posts in canada there was no longer the need to 
 travel to the united states or abroad as most others had before even so collip was one of only three 
 phds that macallum produced and most of his colleagues in canadian university posts were trained elsewhere the majority in britain 
 at the university of alberta collip experienced the struggles of the new generation as it tried to eke out a 
 place for research in academic posts that were geared towards teaching although he had the sympathy 0:sympa 0:thy of a 
 fellow scientist in his president h m tory collip continued to be restricted by the lack of research funds and 
 by the teaching load that was demanded of him because of biochemistry s position as a service course in the 
 medical faculty he also experienced the intellectual isolation 0:isola 0:tion of scientists located far from the established centres of central 
 canada nevertheless collip managed to cultivate his research interests 0:inter 0:ests in general biochemistry and by 1921 had made an 
 impressive start to his career the discovery of insulin was a turning point in collip s career as it was 
 in the development of the medical research community in canada the discovery and collip s contribution to it was a 
 culmination of the work done by ramsay wright and macallum in establishing a strong research tradition and developing excellent laboratory 
 facilities at the university of toronto 1 the impact of the insulin discovery was significant 0:signifi 0:cant banting and to 
 a lesser extent best and collip became the focal point of canadian pride after banting s death best and collip 
 took on the leadership in medical research in the field of endocrinology insulin 
 j b collip 174 marked an important breakthrough in establishing the legitimacy of a young field plagued by its associations 
 with quackery while collip never received full public recognition for his role in the discovery during 0:dur 0:ing his lifetime 
 he benefited immensely from his association with the achievement his share of the insulin royalties provided him with a large 
 and long term source of research funds that was unrivalled in canada save for banting and best the prestige of 
 his association with the work also drew other donations from private benefactors and philanthropic 0:phil 0:anthropic foundations before insulin collip 
 was certainly one of the promising young medical researchers in the country after insulin his place as a leader in 
 the field was secured collip s role in the insulin discovery diverted his research career from its original path in 
 general biochemistry to one in medical biochemistry 0:biochemis 0:try especially in the study of hormones with therapeutic value while he 
 took a broad approach to this field his best known achievements in subsequent years follow closely on the pattern set 
 in the insulin work the isolation and characterization of hormones useful in clinical therapy 0:ther 0:apy his next major accomplishment 
 the preparation of an active extract 0:ex 0:tract of the parathyroid hormone put him in the midst of a struggle 
 by the fledgling profession of laboratory researchers to define themselves against traditional clinical styles of investigation in endocrine studies his 
 dispute with hanson also reveals the challenges posed by the growing 0:grow 0:ing involvement of academic scientists in the commercial 
 development of medical products while collaborative ventures between pharmaceutical 0:pharma 0:ceutical firms and academic researchers could benefit both parties traditional 
 codes regarding the creation and ownership of scientific knowledge were challenged at mcgill collip became firmly established as a researcher 
 his place in megilps faculty was part of the university s campaign to rebuild 0:re 0:build its leading position in 
 medicine by cultivating fundamental and clinical research the discovery of emmenin and its subsequent commercial 0:com 0:mercial development fed into 
 this plan by contributing a therapeutic product that was useful in both gaining public attention and generating new research funds 
 at mcgill collip developed his talents as an entrepreneur of science working to elaborate his post into a full time 
 research position and to nurture a growing group of students and associates the conflict with the british medical research council 
 over the matter of patenting with the result that collip and mcgill bowed to the mrc s demands reveals the 
 strong ties that english canadian academics still had with britain in matters of professional conduct nevertheless the orientation of scientists 
 like collip was firmly turning to the united states first because leadership in scientific research was passing to america during 
 the 1920s and 19305 and second because 
 conclusion 175 the united states through its large philanthropic foundations was a principal source of research funds for canadians during 
 his great years at mcgill collip was able to make the transition to the large team collaborative style of research 
 that was to become the dominant pattern in subsequent years in doing this he was in a small way part 
 of a general trend in scientific research worldwide moving from little science to big science he developed a broadly based 
 research program that capitalized on the talents and disciplinary training of his associates his greatest successes followed in the pattern 
 of his insulin work because he excelled in manipulative biochemistry especially in the extraction of active principles from glandular tissue 
 he was also fortunate to have a team of fine co workers who then examined these extracts for their physiological 
 activities he and his group were on the forefront of endocrine research worldwide and his many students especially j s 
 l browne guaranteed that endocrinology 0:endocrinol 0:ogy would remain one of the principal areas in which canadian medical 0:medi 0:cal 
 scientists have made important contributions collip s strengths and weaknesses are apparent in the laboratory his restless personality led him 
 to make a long string of important contributions 0:contri 0:butions to science but it also allowed him to take on 
 too broad a research 0:re 0:search program so that his energies were dissipated and results were sometimes rushed and not 
 always thoroughly developed as the director 0:direc 0:tor of a large group he could be open to a wide variety 
 of interests and yet intolerant of serious challenges to his research program he could be benignly negligent and yet terribly 
 demanding when a subject caught his fancy collip succeeded in building a research group because he was an active 0:ac 
 0:tive entrepreneur of science finding funds for his laboratory was a time consuming task and often fraught with failure learning 
 from his experience with insulin he actively sought the patenting and commercial 0:commer 0:cial development of any of his products 
 with therapeutic potential while some efforts failed the parathyroid hormone for instance others succeeded brilliantly such as emmenin and its 
 successor premarin 0:pre 0:marin the royalty funds accruing to him personally for use in research gave him an exceptional hand 
 in his negotiations with his administrators 0:administra 0:tors collip actively sought funding from the rockefeller foundation but failed for scientific 
 and administrative reasons he was successful however in cultivating the acquaintance of prominent canadians and attracting their donations his friends 
 and students generally remember him as a shy modest man slow to his own defence yet bold in the support 
 of others this assessment 0:as 0:sessment contrasts sharply with the comments of his institutional superiors 0:supe 0:riors who at times 
 thought of him as ambitious self seeking and 
 176 j b collip temperamental as a person he was quickly provoked by real or imagined 0:imag 0:ined slights especially 
 when he felt that his accomplishments were not adequately rewarded as an institution builder he had to wrestle with his 
 administrators to forge a secure place for his research endeavours his lifelong dream of a pure research post was finally 
 fulfilled with the creation of the research institute of endocrinology but ironically only when he was no longer able to 
 use it when he left mcgill the research institute was quickly reabsorbed into the department of biochemistry collip s institute 
 did not set a trend for free standing institutes for fundamental medical research almost all basic medical science remained tied 
 to undergraduate teaching the research department 0:depart 0:ment that was set up for banting and later headed by best remained 
 unique a product of the insulin discovery 3 the department of medical research set up for collip at western was 
 terminated two years after his death and like his mcgill institute was reabsorbed back into the traditional department structure thus 
 collip s scientific legacy is found not in the continuation of particular institutions but in the successful 0:suc 0:cessful careers 
 of his students and collaborators in many centres throughout canada and around the world collip s varied experiences during his 
 long career convinced him of the need for systematic governmental support of medical research he recognized that his own position 
 had been exceptional and that many of his colleagues had far greater difficulty in conducting research and recruiting students a 
 major barrier was the lack of funds the involvement 0:involve 0:ment of medical investigators in the war effort carved a 
 place for medical 0:medi 0:cal research in the public eye and in government funding structures collip worked with the national 
 research council during the war and the boom of the postwar reconstruction period the establishment of a system of grants 
 in aid scholarships and fellowships finally institutionalized 0:institu 0:tionalized medical research making it more feasible for students to pursue advanced 
 studies and for senior investigators to make a career of experimental work as well as governmental funding other sources of 
 support were developed at this time such as the voluntary societies and pharmaceutical firms collip was also an active leader 
 in the third phase of the development 0:develop 0:ment of the medical research community in canada the creation of a 
 social identity he was a dominant figure in the guidance of the medical research journal and in scientific and medical 
 societies his experiences in many schools and regions of the country helped him to promote a truly national vision of 
 the research community collip s story gains us insight into the rise of large scale systematic government funding for medical 
 research for most of his career collip had to piece together his research funds from a combination of public 
 conclusion 177 and private sources in doing so he had to work through the implications 0:implica 0:tions of taking funds 
 from private benefactors public institutions and corporations for scientists and their institutions today the problem of navigating the scientific ethical 
 and practical shoals of securing funding for research 0:re 0:search is more acute than ever especially in relation to industry 
 in 2001 eighty years after the discovery of insulin and the start of the university of toronto s relationship with 
 eli lilly the university faced a very public controversy psychiatrist david healey accused the university 0:univer 0:sity of scuttling his 
 appointment to a post at the centre for addiction and mental health camh and the department of psychiatry because of 
 his critical remarks about prozac manufactured by eli lilly the camh s largest sponsor this led to a storm of 
 media attention with leading academics and media commentators expressing grave concern about the closeness of the relationship of industry to 
 academia and about the challenge to academic freedom 4 nearby at the university of toronto teaching hospital the hospital for 
 sick children dr nancy olivieri was the focus of international attention when apotex the pharmaceutical company funding her clinical trials 
 attempted to suppress 0:sup 0:press her findings of adverse side effects of its drug a committee of inquiry noted the 
 controversy arose in a context where public institutions 0:insti 0:tutions now have to rely more on funding from private corporations 
 but haven t put in place adequate policies and practices to protect the public s in his day collip and 
 his associates traversed this difficult terrain negotiating issues as they arose navigating through changing expectations 0:expecta 0:tions and ethos and 
 hammering out pragmatic solutions that paved the way for the investigators and institutions of today collip was able to capitalize 
 on his abilities both as a talented researcher and an adept entrepreneur of science to build an eventful and successful 
 career for himself and to contribute to the institutionalization of medical research in canada
