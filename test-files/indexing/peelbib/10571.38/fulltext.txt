 7 colonel of the regiment s message major general c b ware dso cd the regiment may well look back 
 with satisfaction on our diamond jubilee year a significant anniversary indeed we were able to assess sixty years of distinguished 
 service to sovereign and country and equally look forward ready as always to meeting any call that canada may make 
 in the year which lies ahead our past history is a solid foundation which shall guide all who shall serve 
 in the future and there could be no greater pattern to follow so the jubilee indeed focused our attention not 
 only on this glorious past but on an equally great future patricias may well be content with the prospect our 
 jubilee year did commence so sadly with the loss of our beloved colonel in chief lady patricia ramsay however as 
 lady patricia wished plans were carried out virtually unaltered it was then with great joy that all ranks greeted the 
 planned and speedy succession of our new colonel in chief the lady brabourne against the inevitable day in 1966 and 
 subject to the wishes of the regimental executive lady patricia had designated her choice as successor colonel in chief princess 
 patricia s canadian light infantry it was her goddaughter patricia brabourne a cousin named after her and a great granddaughter 
 of queen victoria the regimental executive happily acceded so in our jubilee year the lady brabourne succeeded as colonel in 
 chief and visited her regiment for the first time and celebrate our sixtieth anniversary she was accompanied by her distinguished 
 father earl mountbatten of burma the rest is now history no one could doubt that our first colonel in chief 
 would choose her successor well but in all truth when our new lady patricia as we prefer to know her 
 in the regiment was seen she captivated all ranks and all who saw her she was thrilled by her appointment 
 and the way with the blessing of her majesty the queen that it had come about and i know that 
 all patricia s were thrilled by her and by this succession which was so happy and so much a family 
 one she was immediately at home with her regiment and her regiment was completely with her from the first meeting 
 i shall not dwell upon the important events of the year which shall be catalogued herein however our jubilee is 
 over and we enter a new era this year all battalions were at home they served with distinction and hard 
 work throughout canada with many individuals abroad from korea the middle east viet nam nato and various un committements the 
 pattern this year changes with first battalion in ace mobile role second at home but preparing for 25th anniversary celebrations 
 of kapyong in 1976 and then cyprus and third battalion serving well on the coast and alaska now preparing for 
 cyprus later this year i have seen all battalions this year the spirit is high and i trust all members 
 of the association shall endeavor to support them as well as continue to increase comradeship through membership in the association 
 and in all i recall our efforts of this jubilee particularly those veterans of two world wars and korea who 
 marched past with such great spirit in calgary and 
 8 victoria the regiment is and remains strong and i am certain that all our devotion and dedication will so 
 remain in the happy spirit of our founder our first colonel in chief and above all our new lady patricia

 9 editor s page each year by means of this page i have the opportunity to address myself to a 
 fairly large number of the members of the regiment both serving and retired this is a humbling thought and one 
 that i must not treat lightly in so doing i have attempted to choose my words with care and because 
 of this a report on the year 1974 is a task of monumental proportion the 60th diamond jubilee year ran 
 the gamut of all our emotions from the loss of a colonel in chief to the gaining of a new 
 colonel in chief to all the ceremonies and celebrations inherent with a jubilee the death of lady patricia ramsay in 
 her 55th year as colonel in chief was an event which will forever leave its mark on the regiment it 
 signalled the end of an era an era spanning close to 60 years how she would have rejoiced with us 
 in our jubilee six months after her death we were able to announce the appointment of a new colonel in 
 chief it is most appropriate that a cousin and goddaughter the lady brabourne should be named to carry on in 
 her stead lady patricia ramsay could not have chosen a better successor for chosen she was by her in 1966 
 to the lady brabourne the new lady patricia we pledge our allegiance and loyalty she has our unflagging devotion loyalty 
 and love the jubilee year was marked by memorable events the first event unfortunately cancelled two days before it was 
 to take place was to have occurred in winnipeg second battalion was to exercise the regiment s right to the 
 freedom of the city of winnipeg and celebrate the 23rd anniversary of the battle of kapyong korea unfortunately the flood 
 conditions in the southern part of manitoba necessitated the calling out of the battalion to assist in its control and 
 the evacuation of threatened residents just as unfortunate was second battalion s inability not of their own making to reschedule 
 their ceremonies for later in the year this editor has a vivid memory of the event in that during an 
 overnight motel stop in regina enroute to winnipeg by car he was aroused at 11 p m by a regina 
 city police constable with a most precise message the ceremonies had been cancelled and it was recommended that he return 
 to calgary the rcmp and regina city police are to be complimented on their success in tracking their quarry to 
 ground the next event took place in victoria british columbia when third battalion received the freedom of the city of 
 victoria on the 15th of june on behalf of the regiment on this occasion during the acceptance of the freedom 
 the colonel of the regiment major general cb ware dso cd was able to make the announcement that the lady 
 brabourne dl jp had been appointed colonel in chief simultaneously the announcement was released to the british newspapers coincidently it 
 was the occasion of the annual trooping the colour ceremony by the brigade of guards in london the london papers 
 later carried a picture of the royal family in their appearance on the balcony of 
 10 buckingham palace following the ceremony and with them was our colonel in chief and her father earl mountbatten of 
 burma the ist of july saw the third battalion perform their jubilee ceremony of trooping the colour in royal athletic 
 park victoria although performed on a grassed surface accepted as being difficult to do it was carried off in a 
 flawless manner the 10th of august was the focal point for the regiment s tribute to 60 years of service 
 the 10th of august 1974 60 years to the day that the regiment s charter was signed saw the first 
 battalion perform the jubilee trooping the colour it was a proud occasion indeed the colonel in chief was on parade 
 and with her her father earl mountbatten also present were some of the originals of that day 60 years before 
 an occasion not to be soon forgotten the final act for the jubilee year was the unveilling of a memorial 
 stone at the birthplace of the regiment lansdowne park ottawa unveilled on the 6th of october by rd whitmore an 
 original this stone will forever mark our jubilee and the regiment s beginning other events took place during the year 
 and are related in the pages which follow none of these is insignificant each will take it s place in 
 our history a history unmatched in the annals of canada and its military community it is regretted that the foregoing 
 jubilee report must be followed by a note which is not quite as pleasant the annual journal has been subjected 
 to the normal increased costs inherent in to day s spiralling costs of living costs which have incurred close to 
 a 5000 00 deficit to the journal in the past three years this edition the patrician 1974 will therefore be 
 the final edition in book form preliminary investigation has led us to believe that a magazine style layout may be 
 within our financial means we must also apologize for the lateness in publishing the patrician 1974 a number of delays 
 have been experienced whilst attempting to have it published by more economical means all of which have been futile spalding

 15 exercise nahanni iv adventure training expedition to climb mount hamilton gault in the north west territory 12 28 jul 
 74 in mid july members of the reconnaissance platoon recce from 2 ppcli set out to climb mount hamilton gault 
 as part of the unit s 60th diamond jubilee celebrations and as part of the unit s contribution to the 
 centennial celebrations for the city of winnipeg mount hamilton gault is named after the founder of the regiment and is 
 located in the nahanni river valley of the nwt approximately 250 air miles north east of watson lake in the 
 yukon it is the tallest peak in a small cluster of five rugged tops and reaches a height of 7500 
 feet above sea level because of unit training committments the recce platoon found its strength drastically reduced as the actual 
 time for departure drew near capt d h martin and his second in command sergeant now warrent officer smiley were 
 able to muster a total of eight men these men were joined by two volunteers from support company and two 
 signallers from 1 signal squadron of 1 combat group to produce a total mountain climbing expedition of twelve all ranks 
 stage one of the expedition required an air move by hercules aircraft from winnipeg via calgary to watson lake except 
 for a seized brake at calgary resulting in a one hour delay the hercules flight originating from 435 squadron edmonton 
 was uneventful stage two required an airlift by an iroquois helicopter of 408 squadron from watson lake to the nahanni 
 river landing site this required ferrying men and supplies a round trip of 500 miles and was completed in five 
 lifts over a three day period beginning on 12 july deployment on the 13th and 14th was generally on again 
 off again because of flying conditions lcol fentiman capt purdy and mcpl noble were the helicopter crew for this deployment 
 and did an excellent job of getting the team to the landing zone safely the helicopter departed on 14 july 
 and was not due back until 26 july to begin the return airlift out to watson lake the deployment period 
 from watson lake was highlighted by the interest and tolerance of the staff and ground maintenance personnel at the watson 
 lake airfield considerable energy was expended by the airport staff in ensuring the safety of local horses that have a 
 tendency to wander onto the airstrip to add interest the staff on one occasion was also required to shoo off 
 two ppcli privates who nonchalantly wandered onto the strip after a sight seeing trip as a cp airliner was about 
 to make its approach needless to say once was enough meanwhile the platoon bivouac was established by capt martin at 
 irvine creek at a distance of some five miles from mount hamilton gault the site 
 16 was selected since no suitable helicopter landing place was visible on the initial recce of the nahanni river area 
 the spot selected was two miles nw of the creeks junction with the flat river while deploying the men by 
 helicopter numerous moose were sighted plus one grizzly bear and cub the bear sighting was established as approximately six miles 
 west of the bivouac site everyone displayed a keen interest in bear news the signal detachment quickly constructed an improvised 
 antenna and on the following day succeeded in netting in with gateway penhold our sole contact with the outside world 
 for twelve glorious days and nights cpl clark and pte burns from 1 signal squadron were most successful in their 
 efforts to maintain this contact throughout the entire period camp routine was quickly established with mosquito nets strung and half 
 shelters pitched using ground sheets a massive chin up bar and mini obstacle course was quickly constructed by corporals kettle 
 tucker sweetapple and pte peckford and jones ably supervised by master corporal mccarthy to our amusement corporal sweetapple had to 
 continually bend his knees to use the chin up bar if it did little for the biceps the outdoor gym 
 did wonders for the stomach muscles while watching the antics of the future edmund hillary types in the group two 
 minor injuries occurred during the pre climb work outs and as a result cpl sweetapple and pte peckford remained behind 
 with the signal detachment when the actual climb began on 18 jul both men were thoroughly disgusted with coming so 
 far to miss the climax of the actual mountain climb however the decision of the medical assistant cpl turpin was 
 final and both were relegated to fire watchers the climb proved to be a grueling business even after the one 
 week work up period a thorough maze of deadfall trees lay criss crossed over a bog for the first two 
 miles the deadfall gradually gave way to mixed hardwood and alders which if anything were even more frustrating to wade 
 through next came the beginning of the actual climb the line selected was from the south east and involved climbing 
 the leading edge of the first of the five peaks and approaching the top of mount hamilton gault along the 
 crest line this approach was selected because of the steepness of the mountains on other likely approaches and also the 
 density of undergrowth leading to the base of the mountains in other areas the first night was spent in a 
 re entrant at approximately 2 500 feet from the top crest line and one peak short of our objective the 
 night was cold with scattered showers a decent fire was kept burning throughout the night resulting in one side of 
 the body being scorched and the other decidedly chilled a late start was made the following morning since it took 
 time to collect sufficient fire wood to boil water and prepare a hot breakfast over an open fire besides we 
 were in no rush and leg muscles were already stiff and sore patches of snow were found at the 6 
 000 feet level the final approach was completed late in the evening with light drizzle and the threat of a 
 heavy rain storm a marker placed by a previous expedition was not found at the actual peak of the mountain 
 and caused some consternation until it was actually 
 17 discovered on a ridge some 150 meters back from the summit of mount hamilton gault the marker placed by 
 capt maione s expedition in 1964 to dedicate the mountain in honour of the regimental founder consists of a 3v2 
 to 4 foot high rock cairn with a cylindrical tube containing the following message on vp crested paper capt maione 
 and his party scaled these cliffs on 19 aug 1964 and named this mountain hamilton gault a silver plaque was 
 also found at the cairn inscribed in memory of douglas mcfarlane presented by his wife helen 1964 as well as 
 a short history of the founding of the regiment in 1914 by hamilton gault all this material is in good 
 repair and undisturbed by the elements as a memento of our climb a nominal roll of all participants was suitably 
 placed among the boulders at the very top of mount hamilton gault in a water proof container names of those 
 who made the trip are capt doug martin recce platoon commander wo g h smiley recce platoon mcpl m b

 therefore decided to return to the previous bevouac for the night and return to the main camp site the following 
 morning the balance of the time while waiting for the return of our helicopter lift was spent fishing exploring the 
 local area and listening to cpl turpin tell newfie jokes pte clark and pte burns did a remarkable job of 
 collecting information from the ether including such stations as kito equador another unknown south america station and a program called 
 passport new york from new york news of the recent coup in cyprus kept us on edge since it appeared 
 all canadian aircraft including our return trip hercules might be tasked for other duties a sad note was injected into 
 the waiting period when a message was received from penhold for mcpl mccarthy advising him that his dad had died 
 of cancer in hospital our sympathy was extended to mccarthy but of course it was not possible to have him 
 evacuated until the first helicopter flight out to watson lake the first flight out originated on the 26th of july 
 in between heavy rain showers flying conditions were again hampered by rain on the 
 18 the team which assaulted mount hamilton gault a final check of equipment prior to departure from winnipeg the team 
 leader captain d martin on the right 27th but by their persistance capt purdy and his crew lt larry hunt 
 and mcpl willey willet were able to take the last of us off just prior to last light on 28 
 july our hercules arrived much to our amazement an hour early at watson lake for the return journey to winnipeg 
 and calgary the return trip to winnipeg went off like clockwork and on 29 july exercise nahanni iv passed into

 the home station officers mess the highlight of the jubilee celebrations took place on saturday august 10th at 1400 hours 
 when the first battalion trooped the colour the trooping ceremony was of a high standard and all ranks of the 
 battalion were obviously proud to be able to participate in such a ceremony before their colonel in chief during the 
 lady brabourne s address to the battalion she stated that of the many military ceremonies she had attended none were 
 more professionally conducted than that which she had just witnessed the battalion marched off the square behind the old guard 
 which consisted of over one hundred retired patricias no one who witnessed the old guard s smartness and sense of 
 pride could help but be deeply moved by this now traditional conclusion to our trooping ceremony the functions in the 
 evening at the various messes were a fitting conclusion to the week s activities the lady brabourne visited all the 
 messes during the 
 22 evening and met many unit members former members and distinguished visitors the lady brabourne inspected a 100 man guard 
 of honour at the calgary international airport on sunday august 11th immediately before departing from calgary she stopped at winnipeg 
 for a short visit with second battalion before returning to the united kingdom everyone at the home station was left 
 with a deep sense of satisfaction at the completion of the jubilee celebrations their feeling of pride in their regiment 
 and in a job well done was in no small way due to their desire to do well for their 
 special guest their colonel in chief the lady patricia brabourne her superb address during the trooping and her frank and 
 open conversations with the many individuals with whom she spoke throughout her visit earned for her the highest respect and 
 affection from all ranks of the battalion we look forward to future visits of our colonel in chief to calgary

 city to spend a most unforgettable week to ensure we would be royally treated the van doos assigned one host 
 for each visiting patricia these hosts ensured both by their own time and money that we would have a good 
 time although high costs prohibited the r22er sending representatives from their battalion in europe a total of 28 soldiers were 
 sent from their two canadian based battalions the van doos arrived in edmonton under captain roger belanger where they were 
 met and escorted to calgary to a welcoming party at the currie junior ranks club in addition to many trips 
 to the stampede grounds the van doos also visited the glenbow museum the horseman s hall of fame heritage park 
 and took a bus tour to banff and lake louise one of the highlights of their visit was the presentation 
 of the traditional white stetsons by mayor rod sykes the mayor took time out from his busy schedule to present 
 each soldier with a stetson and to welcome them personally to the calgary stampede their visit culminated with a buffet 
 supper at the ppcli home station officers mess where goodbyes were said and an exchange of plaques took place it 
 was decided that it was indeed a worthwhile exchange as it established a better comradeship between the regiments let us 
 hope that his was just the start of many future exchanges a company by corporal g a burnell five members 
 of a company managed to bring in the year of 1974 in true company tradition we hosted a party for 
 the rest of the unef contingent from 1 ppcli in the luxurious quarters of cpl graham mac donald s marquee 
 tent during the evening privates don philpot and pete melvin did some public relations for the battalion by dragging in 
 a soldier from the senegalese u n force and showing him the delights of the after effects of drinking canadian 
 club with the rest of a company participating whole heartedly a promotion party was held in january to celebrate pte 
 mac donald s promotion to corporal we found that one should not take an unguided tour of a primitive egyptian 
 village although primitive the tradition of the village prevailed as was made obvious by the cuts and bruises displayed by 
 our two tourists who had been stoned by the chamber of commerce of the village s well meaning citizens while 
 on this good will tour public relations were set back 100 years thank you cpl gordie burnell and pte philip 
 mosely and last but not least cpl burnell s 35mm ninolta which was to blame for the whole thing we 
 managed to keep the company s tradition alive by falling second to none in consuming for medicinal purpose only great 
 amounts of alcohol the days managed to blend themselves into one another as days will do with the ear always 
 attuned to one phrase mail call of course there was the ever expected dear john and dear papa letters and 
 also the 
 25 much needed food parcels finally may came and our turn at repatriation back to canada it was the month 
 we had all looked forward to ever since november 1973 we found our greatest thrills over there were airing out 
 our sleeping bags and lining up for growlies at the local kitchen tent the one thought in our minds we 
 were a day closer to going home with our departure the delights of egypt welcomed mcpl bob fife privates bill 
 donovan brian stewart and the notorious ken zimmerman more fine representatives of a company while these fellows from a company 
 were having fun in the sun we in canada were getting geared for a rather long winter of fun in 
 the snow with all the enthusiasm and gusto it could muster a company charged out to the ghost river area 
 about fifty files north west of calgary in ppcli buses two and one half ton trucks of course half the 
 psychological battle was lost the first day because the troops had to be thawed before use although the majority of 
 the chaps were cold they felt better off than one of their buddies his body was designed for a much 
 warmer climate pte munro was quickly frozen on the nose and face can you imagine coming from an island only 
 100 miles from the north east coast of venezuela to fight in the cold with hard bitten canadians who were 
 accustomed to the cold well done on your first winter exercise pte munro needless to say since then pte munro 
 has become accustomed to the cold just like his native canadian counterparts it was fun in ghost river except for 
 a few things we had to put up with the ranger of the area coming around all the time to 
 see if we were cleaning up our garbage and not cutting any of his trees etc the biggest thing though 
 was having to soldier in an area which would be ideal for just wandering around looking at the sights ghost 
 river is a forest and game reserve ten days later after walking up and down hills and dodging logging trucks 
 we got on our army buses this time real buses and headed back to the civilized part of the country 
 just in time to hit one of the wonders of civilization the traffic jam even a traffic jam can be 
 tolerated when a tired body is slumped into a soft seat in a warm bus a few days later we 
 found ourselves again on a warm army bus headed east from calgary talk about your extremes we were going to 
 camp suffield we had but a few days before left some of the nicest hills and forests in alberta and 
 now we were going to the suffield training area where there is only but one copse of trees for as 
 far as the eye can see this area is a never ending monotony of small rolling hills and nothingness it 
 was quite amusing to have sentries out when we were faced with some of the worst white outs you could 
 imagine not only could the sentry not see the enemy but he couldn t see his own hands at arm 
 s length suffield was a wonderful place and a company personnel enjoyed the place immensely especially the all night walk 
 some fifteen miles or so into the wind of course it was worth the walk because the sleeping bag was 
 waiting for the weary travellers as soon as they got their tent routine in order as the adage goes no 
 rest for the weary we of a company found that our long winter was not over four days after we 
 finished that exercise in canada s barrens we were on hercules aircraft bound for the out doorsman s paradise of 
 the good old usa alaska the trip was more or less uneventful except for 
 26 one airpocket that we hit which dislodged our gear and gave most aboard the pallor of one just hit 
 in the face with white wash our american buddies were on the whole a good bunch of fellows the battalion 
 was the go devil battalion we were attached to them as a company and we proved to be their betters 
 as cold weather troops of course they like to take their people from their natural environment as we do in 
 most cases and so a lot of their men should have been in short sleeves in florida or california it 
 really was an interesting and enlightening trip for some of the younger chaps they learned a lot about the opposite 
 sex and how things are done in more or less open towns when they went to the better bars and 
 clubs of course they would never get to see things like this in the bible belt of which calgary is 
 the capital they also learned very quickly but still too late that things get expensive in these places but none 
 the less they were happier even though they were broke like our mid east counter parts we did not let 
 tradition fall by the wayside we were issued our liquor in forty ounce bottles and proceeded to show the americans 
 that a company could not be beaten in the drinking of spirits much to the chagrin of the americans only 
 dragging our throbbing heads onto our hercs we said goodbye to our brothers to the north and hello to those 
 bags that are supplied to all passenger flights and winged our way back to our home on our return we 
 were again busy with unit courses and garrison duties and preparation for the coming summer wainwright concentration in wainwright 0:wain 
 0:wright we lost our company commander captain r l kompf to a posting in pakistan and our csm john lochrie 
 who went to the position of god the fellows in the third battalion welcomed him with open arms i am 
 sure in place of our former company commander we were very lucky to get a man who was not new 
 to those of us in the company in cyprus 71 captain marcel beztilny no cooler dude walks around in the 
 ppcli of course as things will go we lost him but to fill the vacancy we received captain paul ronksley 
 a welcome addition to our company indeed and to fill the csm s shoes we got mwo ed mcdow with 
 some doubts at first but later with welcome on return from wainwright we were split up by our commitments ncos 
 went to vernon to work with cadets and others went back to wainwright to work with the militia the men 
 went to the athabaska river region for adventure training july saw the members of the company with shining boots and 
 glum looks as they began the long up hill struggle to perfect that wonder of parades trooping the colour of 
 course we had to make this one of all the others the best why it was our jubilee not only 
 that but since we had lost our namesake the lady patricia ramsay we were receiving our new colonel in chief 
 the lady brabourne needless to say the trooping came off well and then the fun began again members of the 
 company proved that the demon rum was no match for them as they whooped it up with our new colonel 
 in chief and her father the earl mountbatten of burma finally in september the company reformed under the aforementioned new 
 company commander captain ronksley through the changing and 
 27 the unit course period the company finally found itself altogether late in the year then came christmas and new 
 year s leave but that is another story which will be told in the further adventures of a company 1 
 ppcli b company by private b d pillar 1974 started off in the right fashion as b found itself re 
 inforced with thirty five recruits fresh from cornwallis however these soldiers still had to take their pay level three training 
 at sarcee starting january bth and would not join the company until april 19th just in time for waincon 74 
 little did they know just how tough and much concentration this long exercise would need waincon 74 showed to these 
 soldiers now part of the back bone of b company that one of the main ponts of training is survival 
 this point came to a head during one night of the exercise when many of b found themselves on patrol 
 in the pitch dark pouring rain and freezing winds i can still hear to this day that clattering sound when 
 we stopped atop an open hill the sound of pte squires dentures knocking together it was that cold it was 
 back to calgary by may 23rd the company was more than normally successful in the 1974 sports programme to start 
 off the year on the right foot the b company hockey team fought it s way to a 7 4 
 triumph over headquarters company to win the dunklemen sherwood inter company hockey trophy in mid march after a long rest 
 hockey again got under way in early december 1974 with high hopes of a march repeat however a so called 
 slave trade resulted in the loss of ptes edwards and russell two fine hockey players to headquarters company they have 
 to win somehow another loss for b and a gain for germany was lieutenant frank forte also a good hockey 
 player however hopes are high that the trophy will stay in b company in 1975 football was another event in 
 the great line of classics for us as we outscored the support squad 19 1 in the great event of 
 the year the french grey cup held november ist four mugs were presented by lieutenant colonel sharpe to b company 
 captain j v s mckeen for best line backer pte tracey for best offensive player pte lelievre for best all 
 around player and last but not least mwo mcmillan for best guard he came to us early in september to 
 replace mwo murray who was posted to gagetown after the november ist encounter b company presented mcpl lafont of support 
 company with a trophy for the stamina and fitness he displayed in football against other players half his age and 
 twice his size mountain climbing and cross country skiing under lieutenant forte and captain mekeen respectively found their ways into 
 the heavy schedule and many privates enjoyed themselves i ve saved the best for the last and that is exercise 
 potlach i the largest amphibious military operation ever staged in canada took place in and around the northern part of 
 vancouver island from 15 to 26 september 1974 it was a combined canada u s exercise involved were a total 
 of 2 280 sailors 
 28 exercise ace card vii soldiers and airmen the aim of this huge operation was to land troops on the 
 northern shores and rid the island of an enemy company which just happened to be us we proved to be 
 a very effective enemy force and on october 11th brigadier general p a neatby cd commander 1 combat group presented 
 a plaque in recognition of our support and hard work there is word going around which i know is true 
 because the umpires are backing it up that a number of high ranking us marines were ambushed while plodding along 
 one of the beaches also there is plenty of truth to the fact that many officers and ncos of 3 
 ppcli were successfully ambushed by us to avoid embarrassing 3 ppcli i will not list the names of all the

 29 c company by lieutenant d s heath c company welcomed in 1974 with mixed emotions once more the new 
 year heralded the mech unit s involvement in that often unpleasant event called winter as usual apcs and drivers were 
 dispersed throughout the other tents and other arctic gear were readied as c company prepared for her first exercise in 
 74 early light under command of major john bremner c company deployed to cfb suffield in the midst of a 
 chinook temperatures rose and perspiring parka clad soldiers struggled with toboggans over snowless countryside but as often is the case 
 in suffield temperatures soon dropped and the area was blanketed with snow as the battalion assembled in suffield c company 
 completed it s training in time to participate in ex northern razor i throughout the exercise the battalion was plagued 
 by high winds and white outs tent poles snapped freely often leaving occupants holding the proverbial bag many a sentry 
 contemplated the paraphrase many are cold but few are frozen mcpl john elson had many stories to tell after spending 
 three days on a standing patrol separated from the company hindered by poor visibility and a frozen radio the only 
 transmission heard for three days was where s my rum ration exercise northern razor ended in a battalion attack over 
 what seemed to be a mile of wasteland however the chicken dinner back in a ech did help to ease 
 aches and pains of the previous week the intervening period from february to april was largely devoured by courses in 
 all specialties sgt now wo trapper couronne once again headed his team of instructors on the dvr apc course for 
 several weeks soldiers scraped posts jostled instructors and broke track sometimes unintentionally one often wonders how close some of those 
 students have come to being set adrift in a leaky carrier waincon was inevitable in 74 as it always is 
 and training for the concentration started in early april under captain lance ruck keene who had replaced major john bremner 
 as company commander after major bremner s departure for egypt several trips to sarcee were made to test basic fieldcraft 
 and practise battle procedure deployment to wainwright for c company came on 21 april we were greeted by wo loucks 
 then cqms but now csm of c company who had arranged accomodation and secured those extras only a cq can 
 for two weeks emphasis was placed on weapons qualification lieutenant jim lee organized and ran the 7 62 mm and 
 50 cal machine gun ranges in all over 40 000 rounds were fired under the careful supervision of sergeant pinter 
 and mcpls hibbs lewis and voith the second phase of waincon 74 was 2 weeks of arduous company training emphasizing 
 patrolling and night operations we quickly mastered our lessons and prepared to participate in the battalion exercise

 defended it s area repelling fantasians daily from the third day of the exercise the company had an additional commitment 
 that of training with b squadron ldsh rc for the combat group fire power demonstration the company largely unknown to 
 the rest of the battalion then became the fantasians after a tortuous approach drive through every swamp in wainwright b 
 company s flank was turned and a echelon annihilated but only after an efficient gate sentry had ushered us unto 
 the traffice circuit with the additional commitment the company s day was indeed a full one by day the comapny 
 perfected their demonstration but by night they pillaged and plundered the other rifle companies several days later 
 31 the entire brigade was entertained with a display of infantry and armoured firepower a combined infantry armoured assault preceeded 
 by artillery and mortar bombardment culminated in the exploitation of the objective by four centurion tanks which the strathconas had 
 resurrected from their graveyard with little time to catch our breath c company launched into the brigade exercise providing both 
 depth and counter attack elements for the battalion the company weathered the onslaught of the fantasians throughout the defensive phase 
 of operations deployed on a secondary axis during the advance the mechaneers made speedy headway seizing vital objectives on the 
 battalion axis and providing fire support for other companies june saw many members of the green machine journey to the 
 athabaska area for exercise athabaska ranger a two week adventure training programme the activities ranged from a river trip in 
 assault boats to a three day exercise in survival in the swamps of athabaska wo skehen mcpl holm and mcpl 
 elson from c company provided the expertise for survival training and bushcraft the 15th of july signalled the commencement of 
 diamond jubilee trooping preparations c company assembled under csm loucks for drill drill and more drill three weeks later they 
 emerged as number 3 guard under command of captain lance ruck keene to parade in front of the colonel in 
 chief with the jubilee celebrations complete c company took a break for a couple of weeks of well deserved leave 
 by the time most of the officers and ncos had returned from summer tasking and most of the soldiers returned 
 from leave it was september time for major barry ashton to take over as company commander time for more courses 
 but almost as important time for the company s athletes to start warming up in anticipation for the struggle for 
 the french grey cup the company surprised even itself after an indifferent start they began to beat people including headquarters 
 company last years winners and b company who were to win the cup this year the stumbling block however was 
 support company who beat us in the playoffs the hand ball team was beaten in the final of their competition 
 by headquarters company despite a remarkable three goals in three minutes last second comeback although it did not snow on 
 grey cup day it did soon after and it wasn t very long before snowshoes and mukluks were being dusted 
 off again probably the greatest triumph for the company in this period was the high praise the apcs received during 
 the mti wo couronne with his thoroughly well trained subordinates deserve credit for the very hard work put into this 
 inspection and so the cycle is repeated but as much as it appears the same it changes different personnel and 
 equipment provide challenges within c company 1974 was a good year for c company but 1975 brings with it challenge 
 hard work and reward 
 32 d company by captain d g cassidy d company christened 1974 by popping the cork on a bottle of 
 srd while crouched in an arctic tent on the frozen wind swept plains of cfb suffield commanded by captain w 
 j g bewick with captain h t kranenburg as 2ic the company snowshoed it s way through one battle after 
 another on exercise northern razor until eventually following an all around professional performance they acheived a final victory and were 
 rewarded with the long sought exercise cease fire the excellent error free performance of the individual platoons on the exercise 
 may not seem so peculiar when in retrospect one recalls that due to outside commitments the company s lieutenants were 
 not on the ground lieutenant j calvin was training pay level three soldiers in sarcee and lieutenant g liboiron was 
 in quebec forwarding his career on a french language course as a result the three rifle platoons were commanded by 
 sergeant e o basaraba and mcpl p m derochie and mcpl t a english it was noted that both lieutenants 
 appeared somewhat concerned about their job security when briefed on the excellent performance of their subordinates however after it was 
 explained that as lieutenants they worked for considerably less money they realized their future was quite secure following exercise northern 
 razor d company concerned itself with unit courses until mid april when it was once again time to take to 
 the open spaces this time camp wainwright for six weeks as part of the battalion the company conducted refresher training 
 completed it s range requirements and participated in various exercises shortly after returning to calgary in june a majority of 
 the company s personnel were again underway this time mounted on assault boats navigating the athabaska river as part of 
 the adventure training project exercise athabaska ranger although the general concensus was that floating was far better than walking several 
 individuals appeared somewhat displeased with the consistent dietary supplement of fish upon return to calgary everyone found themselves in a 
 much drier and hotter environment namely the parade square for a month it was left form mark time halt and 
 quick march as the battalion rehearsed the physical requirements demanded by the regiment s sixtieth anniversary for an additional week 
 and a half in august all personnel were totally involved in the numerous celebrations and parties commemorating the regiment s 
 anniversary 0:anniver 0:sary and then thankfully it was time for some well deserved leave september saw the company split three 
 ways one group consisted of students and instructors destined for the fall schedule of unit courses a second group of 
 section size under command of sergeant j e huntley left for wainwright where they functioned as demonstration and enemy force 
 for the candidates on the combat leaders course the final group a platoon size force of volunteers commanded by lieutenant 
 liboiron journeyed to the 
 33 northern tip of vancouver island where as a guerilla force they proceeded to create havoc with an invading american 
 marine battalion when finally the three groups were reunited in calgary they were introduced to two new officers captain merv 
 mcmurray replaced captain bill bewick as oc and captain dave cassidy took over as second in command both officers were 
 only on the ground for a short period however as captain mcmurray left almost immediately for a month in germany 
 as an exercise umpire and captain cassidy accompanied by mcpl g j clyke was off for the beaches of australia 
 as participants on the jungle warfare course the fall period also brought other alterations to the company structure as the 
 rifle team was formalized into an integral sub unit and joined the company as 12 platoon as a result of 
 the addition of this august unit the company was capable of offering specialized weapon training to all members of the 
 battalion for the remainder of the company the latter part of the year was spent qualifying on various unit courses 
 just prior to christmas leave period however the company treated itself to a week of winter warfare training in the 
 kananaskis lakes area due to temperatures well in excess of 0 f and the provision of recreational periods for such 
 activities as sking fishing mountain climbing and tobogganing the response to this week of fun in the snow was unusual 
 troops bundled in arctic clothing were actually seen smiling and the general concensus among the younger soldiers was that winter 
 warfare definitely wasn t as bad as all the stories they had heard partially as a result of this enjoyable 
 week and the added pleasures of the company christmas party which once again was an unprecedented success the soldiers of 
 dashing delta left on christmas leave with a satisfied feeling that they did undoubtedly belong to the best company in

 small arms team the year 1974 saw change mixed with limited success for the unit small arms team with the 
 emphasis on youth the rifle team in particular recruited a considerable number of young queen s medal hopefuls mwo l 
 a white retired from competitive shooting after many years of active participation the first battalion is indeed grateful to mwo 
 white for his unselfish and extraordinary contribution to military shooting our re structured rifle team under the coaching of sergeant 
 e g hale placed third in the 1 combat group small arms competition the shooting performance of our tyros first 
 year competitors was encouraging and we expect that they will shoot up a storm in 1975 the pistol team coached 
 by mcpl e m johansen captured second place in the combat group competition there is some promising new talent in 
 the unit and who knows 1975 could be the year of the pistol not since 1963 has this battalion won 
 a national team trophy in military competitive shooting the smg team coached by sergeant d ritthaler made history by winning 
 the canadian forces smg trophy at connaught range 
 35 ottawa in september competing on the team were sgt d ritthaler sgt e g hale mcpl g a smith 
 mcpl m j hurley mcpl r a oakley and cpl cp hoffman after so many years without a major victory 
 it was most rewarding to see such excellent results the battalion s serious approach to maintaining and improving the standard 
 of unit marksmanship is illustrated by the commanding officer s decision in september to centralize the small arms team in 
 12 platoon d company permanently the future of competitive shooting in the battalion is indeed rosy and we expect to 
 be shooting at bisley in 1978 headquarters company by captain r s routledge headquarters company which comprises the battalion headquarters 
 signal platoon recconnaissance platoon mortar platoon pioneer platoon and armoured defence platoon maintained it s usual hectic pace throughout 1974 
 our teams of specialists were involved in practically every major exercise in western canada as well as participating in all 
 aspects of unit individual and collective training many members of the company were sent further afield to such places as 
 australia cyprus egypt israel the southern united states and northern canada the year started in the relative discomfort 20 40 
 degrees below zero of suffield alberta on exercise northern razor our annual learn to get cold again routine most of 
 our soldiers were employed as the enemy force which kept us very busy and relatively independent it was a good 
 exercise despite the fact that the rifle companies managed to defeat we fantasians once again we deployed back to calgary 
 in some rather interestingly designed school buses just in time to complete the final preparations for the unit course period 
 which ran from mid february until the end of march during april may we participated in our old favourite waincon 
 and polished our skills in weaponry communications and battle procedure despite the cold during the first week and the flies 
 during the last week the concentration was an active and beneficial period for all of us we learned a lot 
 re learned some things that we had become rusty in and got to know each other better we also got 
 the chance to see our company commander major lew mackenzie who dropped in after his posting to egypt to tell 
 us that he was leaving on a new posting to germany we all wish him the best of luck and 
 regret that he was not with us longer after waincon we had a short rest before going on exercise athabaska 
 ranger an adventure training project conducted near wandering river alberta this exercise included survival and watermanship and culminated in a 
 leisurely cruise down the athabaska river using the zodiac type raft with small outboard motors our recce platoon ran the 
 
 36 exercise and our pioneer platoon river rats provided the control staff for the watermanship portion there were some interesting 
 moments but all in al the exercise was a great success the majority of the company participated in the trooping 
 and related jubilee activities and then managed to get some leave in late august it was a busy and satisfying 
 period for us all and we certainly got to know the likes and dislikes of the rsm we also had 
 the opportunity to meet our colonel in chief the lady brabourne who made a great hit with all ranks with 
 her relaxed and informal manner all of us enjoyed her visit and hope to see her many times in the 
 future the end of the year saw the arrival of our new company commander majoi john bremner and we soon 
 were back into another busy period of unit courses looking back on 1974 it was an active and worthwhile year 
 which confirmed the ability of headquarters company to provide the command and combat support for the battalion in a timely 
 and competent manner we maj be older but we re better postscript we lost the french grey cup final but 
 we managed to retain the miss french grey cup crown our football team is becoming younger and miss headquarters company 
 is becoming older and better which must be a sign of progress headquarters company handball team 1974 winners 
 37 support company by captain m l catton cd we did it again survived another hectic year what made it 
 hectic was the extra regimental affairs along with a rather large change of personnel it all started in january 74 
 when we trundled off down the road heading east to the thriving metropolis of cfb suffield for exercise northern razor 
 i here we established al and a 2 echelons in support of the battalion our first task was to put 
 up tent town including a kitchen and vehicle repair shop every soldier should be given the opportunity to try it 
 in near hurricane winds and sub sub zero temperatures both installations were used for the last supper when the exercise 
 ended and a mass evacuation or cross country race took place the finish line was al echelon which was immediately 
 turned into a refugee camp here those half frozen souls were given a hot meal including a fresh pork chop 
 all of which was frozen by the time they ran from the kitchen to the fritchie shelter in april we 
 were fortunate enough to be allowed to take part in another adventurous outing it was notoriously known as waincon 74 
 the first phase was devoted to company training annual weapons classifications and the completion of battle efficiency testing this phase 
 culminated with a gathering which included training films of sorts and small quantities of food and drink if anyone remembers 
 next came the battalion exercise it gave support company the chance to become lean mean and tactical good things began 
 happening like defensive positions aircraft drills stand to and passwords which no one could ever remember one day at last 
 light the enemy miraculously found a echelon our stead fast always alert sentry was poised in the dark shadows of 
 concealment ready to be confronted with the best blow the enemy could throw an apc approached our sentry did not 
 engage but cheerfully waved to a friend he had recognized as the driver the impregnable echelon world began to shatter 
 as enemy apcs came rumbling through frantically old soldiers became very nimble on their toes as they scurried in all 
 directions maintenance platoon now know the reasons for digging hidy holes all the fighting tigers of a echelon gallantly defended 
 the command post which was so well hidden that it was completely missed cpl r anderson the brow being a 
 keen and alert old soldier quickly snuffed out a smoke grenade that threatened to burn down our sacred kitchen this 
 was probably his last act of gallantry before going on retirement after 32 years service during the combat group exercise 
 the enemy found the echelon they had been parachuted into the area and were attempting to infiltrate our hallowed sanctuary 
 this time the enemy were so fiercely repulsed that they decided to ramble on to something easier like battalion headquarters 
 on the blackest night of all mcpl n h johnston who was acting as cqms decided to take out the 
 garbage run during his blackout drive in the circle route area he found he was being followed for quite some 
 distance he stopped and found 
 38 several engineer 5 ton trucks heavily loaded with bridging equipment and boats they had tagged on behind hoping mcpl 
 johnston knew where he was going unfortunately all were lost and maybe that s why the river crossing was delayed 
 mid summer saw us back in good old currie barracks a little leave then the ceremony of trooping the colour 
 the infantrymen proceeded to spend many hours of thrashing foot stomping and parade square bashing under the blistering relentless sun 
 the rsm eventually agreed that enough wrinkles had been taken out of the parade square and everything was ready in 
 the meantime the non infantry members of the battalion were doing housekeeping business in preparation for our diamond jubilee celebrations 
 support company performed superbly in all respects on this special occasion in the fall months the busy bee hive also 
 known as building c 4 began to vibrate with enthusiasm a staff inspection and the mechanical technical inspection were fast 
 approaching even with this heavy work load support company soldiers managed to find enough time to rally under mcpl lafont 
 s guidance touch football they won first place in the regular season games which was a shock to the rest 
 of the battalion considering past years performances the play off for the coveted french grey cup unfortunately resulted in us 
 yielding to b company they produced a powerhouse of players and clinched all awards a job well done the men 
 of b company did present a trophy to mcpl lafont acknowledging him to be the most gentlemanly player of the 
 season our beautiful and charming princess price pte also missed out on the crown she had difficulty with her posture 
 and was unable to stand because of dizziness this was probably due to her swing twirling too much on the 
 end of the wrecker boom at times mcpl filpula was seen grabbing for the swing to steady either it or 
 himself the excellent results of the inspections and the very good showing in sports made the new oc captain murray 
 catton very happy with the soldiers of support company he may have had some bewildering and misgiving moments having recently 
 left b company the fall was finished with a visit to the chamber of gas and another 10 mile stroll 
 through sarcee to re affirm fading experiences the new year 1975 started with another winter outing called exercise northern razor 
 11 there was one big difference from the previous winter outing and that was the 40 degrees above zero temperatures 
 this took place in the ghost river area with very little snow and everyone waiting and equipped for the ten 
 foot drifts and sub zero temperatures they never came much to our disappointment during this time we lost a very 
 fine old soldier when mcpl bill codling a vehicle technician with maintenance platoon passed away after a very short illness 
 bill was 50 years old had 32 years service was one of the most helpful soldiers in the company and 
 was known and liked by everyone our loss was one of deep regret felt by all ranks 1974 was a 
 busy year for both the qm stores and the trade section pioneers waincon 74 support was provided simultaneously with a 
 complete unit stocktaking preparing for devil implementation no sooner were these completed when the logistics platoon went full bore on 
 preparations for the jubilee celebrations in august a list of the materials sought and obtained would fill this book suffice 
 to say the support was excellent 
 39 the trade section pioneers with mcpl dutchy vandenberg in charge were also tasked heavily for the jubilee celebrations the 
 chinese bridge located behind the officers mess and the dais on the parade square are excellent examples of the high 
 quality of work turned out a few personnel changes occurred during the year captain furrie the logistics officer disappeared to 
 egypt for six months the rqms mwo frank brown was promoted to chief warrant officer and posted to ottawa and 
 was replaced by mwo gerry o hagan cpl bruce mcleod departed for egypt in september along with cpl wayne parisien 
 the qm clerk to cap the year sergeant tommy thurn was promoted to warrent officer and cpl chris christie was 
 promoted to mcpl football and handball by captain h l ruck keene the french grey cup 74 with only two 
 points separating the first two companies the french grey cup was as closely contested this year as any other in 
 it s 18 year existence of the six company teams only a company was unable to come close to a 
 play off spot d company with five points was the other team not able to reach the play offs in 
 the early part of the season after a narrow win over c company and a hard fought tie with support 
 company they looked like probable play off contenders however their challenge withered for a number of reasons as the season 
 progressed and they did not reach the play offs of the play off teams headquarters company last year s winner 
 was expected to do as well this year they started badly loosing 25 0 to support company and the word 
 was that experience had finally given away to age and that headquarters company were unlikely to reach the play offs 
 however in the critical last game of regular season play they beat b company to qualify c company was the 
 other play off team this was certainly the most improved team in the competition they looked bad in their first 
 three games but later looked much more formidable in beating b and headquarters companies albiet by a combined total of 
 5 points while their defence was solid their offence with the exception of a company was the lowest scoring in 
 the league b company was probably the most incomprehensible and remarkable team in the competition their defence was sound but 
 no sounder than others and their attack seemed based on a haphazard combination of remarkable scrambling at quarter back and 
 occasionally astonishing pass receiving they did well to come from behind to beat headquarters company in an exciting play off 
 support company lost one game to b company during the course of the 
 40 season and looked the strongest team in the competition they had a strong fast defence and a powerful attack 
 with speed in the backfield complimenting a good passing game in the play offs they beat c company 13 4 
 after a tight defensive game won for them by their fast running backs who were expected to be a major 
 factor in the final with b company the final game was almost overshadowed by the traditional parade of the very 
 beautiful miss french grey cup contestants most companies but particularly b d and headquarters entered really excellent floats but it 
 was headquarters company s float with a jeep cunningly disguised as a hillbilly shack surrounded by some very authentic heavily 
 armed hillbillies that was elected the best their miss french grey cup contestant the invitingly voluptuous scantily clad but fortified 
 miss bunny was accordingly crowned miss french grey cup 1974 and was presented with a dozen plastic roses and a 
 bottle of champagne the champagne was drunk immediaely but what happened to the roses goes unrecorded the outcome of the 
 game surprised the pundits support company scored a single point early but were later unable to move the ball against 
 a strong and determined b company defence the b company offence with pte lelievre outstanding at quarterback began to get 
 points on the board ptes lelievre prowse and tracey all scored touchdowns the final score being 19 1 for b 
 company pte lelievre received the trophy as the most valuable player with pte tracey captain mckeen and mwo mcmillan taking 
 the best offensive defensive player and best lineman respectively handball the handball final had been played earlier in the day 
 in regular season play c company was undefeated with five victories headquarters company had four wins and b company three 
 in the final headquarters company despite a last gasp blitz of three goals in as many minutes by c company 
 won 6 3 cpl harnett had played like a man possessed in the headquarters company goal and the victory was 
 a tribute to the cunning captaincy and coaching of sgt hamilton french grey cup 1974

 of the home station mess cheerfully with open arms and pockets hosted the many regular and reserve units in the 
 area a memorable start for a grand year in april 1974 major john bremner with a posting to the middle 
 east cheerfully relinquished his duties as pmc to captain vern mckeen this position was to remain in vern s capable 
 hands until 1 january 1975 the year began with captain rick cunningham as mess secretary he quickly congratulated captain dave 
 giacomelli as his replacement dave carried the ball until after the trooping in august when with a sigh of relief 
 he passed over all duties to lieutenant frank forte to finish the year from the levee to the trooping activities

 the celebrations of our 60th anniversary included a mess dinner attended by the colonel in chief major general ware the 
 earl mountbatten of burma and many others the trooping ball brought the festivities to a brilliant peak with a fantastic 
 banquet and equally outstanding entertainment provided by the ppcli regimental band in november the mess had the distinct pleasure of 
 hosting major general groven commander amf l the general had come to calgary to brief the battalion on it s 
 possible future role in the amf l his worship mayor rod sykes presented general and madame groven with the traditional 
 white stetsons with the events of august and november behind us the mess resumed it s normal activities until the

 our diamond jubilee year was one to be remembered both for the eventful occasions celebrated and for the guests who 
 helped us celebrate them our most memorable time was during the trooping phase when we celebrated the retreat ceremony with 
 an at home cocktail hour and the trooping with a formal ball on both of these occasions we were honoured 
 to receive as our guests the colonel in chief the lady brabourne and her distinguished father the earl mountbatten of 
 burma to have such distinguished charming and worldly guests as these amongst us was truly an honour we shall not 
 soon forget their visit the presence of our colonel in chief and her father was the magnet that drew such 
 a fine representation from the old guard the old guard sergeants were represented by former mess members from world war 
 i world war ii and the korean eras among the notables were owen gardner fred hall jim coutts jim thompson 
 lou england jim shinn joe devlin joe dunn alex simms john richardson b a j franklin norm carlson and many 
 more on the 12th of august 1974 there was a change of command ceremony in which major general g g 
 brown cd handed over command of 1 combat group to brigadier general e m k macgregor mc cd general brown 
 later visited our mess for cocktails and expressed his appreciation for the service that the senior ncos had given him 
 over the years we have soldiered with the general for much of his career and his promotion and posting unfortunately 
 takes him a little further out of reach shortly after major general brown s departure a rare occasion for the 
 mess was the hosting of a mixed formal dining in this was in honour of our departing 1 combat group 
 commander brigadier general e m k macgregor 0:macgre 0:gor mc cd who has been appointed commander combat arms school and

 mmm cd presented general macgregor with the bucking horse cuff links on behalf of the mess members mrs l a 
 white presented flowers to mrs macgregor on behalf of the ladies of the mess the mess hosted a stampede week 
 which coincided with the calgary stampede in the month of july wo nickle and his committee along with the regular 
 entertainment committee set up a programme that included western dancing a games saloon a bar b q and visiting bands 
 all this of course in the true western flavour and dress all in all it was a very enjoyable occasion 
 in the field waincon 74 the mess continued to function very well under sergeant pidgeon ably assisted by the barmen 
 who were completing ojt this facility is much appreciated as it is the hub of our social life while up 
 there it is perhaps the one time that we can all get together to strengthen our comradeship the event that 
 brightened our stay in wainwright was the invitation to 3 ppcli wo s and sr nco s for fun and 
 games during this event we were visited by brigadier general g g brown whose timing coincided with a cloud of 
 gas that had erupted at the officers party we also had a games night with our officers the results are 
 not available for publication but being lousy hosts the sgts probably won all the events a number of personnel changes 
 occured in the mess during the period we had some anxiety when our mess manager mwo connick was posted and 
 our bar manager retired fortunately we had the services of sergeant ed major who ran shop whilst we hunted around 
 for a management staff sergeant fred hawrish returned from cfs alert and his posting to chilliwack was delayed we made 
 good use of his expertise as mess manager and corporal c e graham came in as bar manager our new 
 mess staff saw us through the last half of our jubilee year and we appreciated their assistance the postings in 
 and out are recorded in the back pages of the patrician we did however have some personnel on tour wo 
 fred udell wo chuck berlinghof sgt garry gorman sgt joe smith sgt fred hawes and sgt ed remin went to 
 egypt for six month tours during the period and all have since returned the new year s ball was a 
 success with the majority in attendance being ordinary members the mess was nicely decorated for this occasion by the committee 
 members with special thank yous to sgts haddad and touchette the culinary display complete with ice sculptures was extremely appealing 
 and enjoyed by all music by the check mates who agreed to play as long as we were willing to 
 pay resulted in the ball continuing well into the wee small hours these late hours made it painful for some 
 members to make the levee however duty prevailed and the levee was well attended wo paul rutherford tried in vain 
 to get a 106 mm gun crew together to visit the ldsh rc sgts mess probably a good thing he 
 didn t succeed considering his condition 
 45 currie junior ranks cavalier club by master corporal p o giroux in 1974 the club played host to many 
 events so we will cover only the outstanding functions in february the commander mobile command lieutenant general s c waters 
 visited and had coffee with the members it was at this time that the members had the opportunity to air 
 their views and it enabled general waters to listen to the opinions of the troops under his command july is 
 of course stampede time for calgarians there was plenty of activity with the members trying to beat the committee on 
 games of chance throughout the period members were encouraged to wear western style clothing we then started to prepare for 
 the trooping the colour it was our diamond jubilee while the majority of the men beat the square the pmc 
 mcpl giroux and a keen work crew began to build the better ole in the club six thousand sand bags 
 lots of sand and aching backs later the job was completed one could sit and let his mind wander off 
 and dream of how it must have been his dreams were soon answered by the many veterans who had come 
 from near and far to participate in the trooping festivities on the evening of the trooping the club was honoured 
 by the visit of our colonel in chief the lady brabourne amid a capacity crowd the lady brabourne met and 
 spoke to many members all will remember her visit for years to come accompanying the colonel in chief was her 
 distinguished father the earl mountbatten of burma and the colonel of the regiment major general c b ware we then 
 proceeded to the better ole where once inside the earl mountbatten explained the meaning of the better ole to some 
 of the younger members after the trooping celebrations were completed members said goodbye to major general g g brown knowing 
 how much general brown loved to ski he was presented with an engraved set of skis in september once again 
 we were saying goodbye to our general this time brigadier general e m k macgregor he was presented with a 
 marble desk pen set so that he could sign our future course reports with straight a s ein swei drei

 49 second battalion for the second battalion 1974 was an exciting period of intense activity it was not an ordinary 
 round of events that took us through the year but rather a host of diversified activities from the usual waincon 
 to the celebration of the diamond jubilee and the winnipeg centennial it was a year that saw many changes in 
 personnel so many in fact that by december many parts of the unit were difficult to recognize as usual 1974 
 started off with a bang just ask anyone who helped to celebrate the passing of 1973 january ist saw the 
 customary round of social functions and of course the battalion was ably represented the officer s mess welcomed such distinguished 
 guests as the honourable w j mckeag lieutenant governor of manitoba and rear admiral r st g stevens commander training 
 command visiting teams from the officer s mess and the warrant officer s and sergeant s mess paid a call 
 on such units as the royal winnipeg rifles and the cameron highlanders to name but two the battalion officers were 
 received by the lieutenant governor at the winnipeg civic centre january seemed to be shaping up so nicely and then 
 the battalion was deeply saddened by the passing of our beloved colonel in chief lady patricia ramsay the second battalion 
 was accorded the privilege of sending three representatives to the memorial service held at st george s chapel windsor castle 
 mcpls j l lockhart a cherally and c a roberton represented the unit an attractive trio of visitors from hmcs 
 chippawa show interest in private pl caissie and his 106 recoilless rifle during a demonstration of infantry skills at kapyong 
 barracks 
 50 the next item on the calendar of events was exercise rapier thrust 111 from 18 26 january at churchill 
 this exercise proved to be both interesting and worthwhile from a weather point of view the battalion faced an admirable 
 foe with the chill factor dipping to 130 degrees f overall rapier thrust 111 was an excellent test of both 
 troops and equipment from the end of january to the end of march the main activities were the pl 3 
 courses run in winnipeg and shilo by d company and the various pl 4 courses run to upgrade the professional 
 knowledge of the pl 3 and pl 4 soldiers on march 17 the battalion held a memorial service for the 
 late lady patricia the service was held in the drill hall and was a revised edition of the funeral service 
 in england a display for the personnel of hmcs chippawa was next as far as activities go displays and demonstrations 
 on typical infantry subjects were the fare from demonstrations to the real thing another spring concentration in shilo this period 
 from 1 8 april was devoted to company and platoon training leaving shilo the battalion returned to winnipeg and rehearsals 
 for the kapyong freedom of the city celebrations on 22 april 1974 members of the six guards slated for the 
 kapyong day freedom of the city of winnipeg parade marched from the provincial legislature after a chilly rehearsal to all 
 saints anglican church for the annual unit church parade all saints has had a long association with the regiment dating 
 back to post world war i days when a and hq coy of the regiment first arrived in winnipeg the 
 first set of regimental colours acquired after the ric a dam do were laid up in the church on 14 
 april 1934 and still hang at the front of the church its interesting to note that the parade took place 
 only a few days after the 40th anniversary of this event during the course of the service the commanding officer 
 lcol j h allen spoke to the battalion from the pulpit looking remarkably at home on regimental history the colours 
 and our connection with all saints at the conclusion of the service a diamond jubilee scroll was presented on behalf 
 of the unit and the local ppcli association to the rector commemorating our visit and long ties with all saints 
 after all the hard work and planning the kapyong freedom of the city celebrations had to be cancelled due to 
 flood control operations initial taskings involved the deployment of elements to carmen st norbert and st adolphe to assist representatives 
 of the manitoba emergency measures organization in the relief of homes inundated by the red river a small detachment provided 
 much needed assistance in carmen while in st norbert some 160 personnel the majority from c company and the remainder 
 from mortar and armoured defence platoons were deployed tasks in st norbert ranged from evacuation of homes beyond saving to 
 the sand bagging of surviving homes and the maintenance of the occupants both motor boats and apcs were used most 
 effectively

 battalion did a fine job representing the regiment in a first class fashion thanks to the flood control operations the 
 battalion minus b company arrived late at waincon 74 as usual all the good infantry things were enacted out sub 
 unit training of all types sports and military competitions a combat group exercise and the meeting of old friends it 
 is interesting to note that there was only one unit which bivouaced in the field the fighting second vive the 
 poncho and grey blanket they still work in addition to the usual summer taskings of routp ssep milcon arts and 
 cadet assistance each of the companies undertook a project to commemorate the diamond jubilee of the regiment and the city 
 of winnipeg s centennial b company was involved in a series of mini tattoos and contributed to the military salute 
 to winnipeg this contribution was a static display of the korean war with emphasis on kapyong the mini tattoo was 
 two and a half hours long and included a boer war world war i drill scene as well as rappelling 
 unarmed combat and pugilistic fighting demonstrations the mini tattoo was a great success with over 10 000 people seeing the 
 show the pioneer platoon had its own special project they assisted in reconstruction and renovation of saint peters old stone 
 church st peters now considered an historical site dates back to 1836 and is located on the banks of the 
 red river east of selkirk during the work the pioneers discovered that three members of the regiment who had served 
 during world war ii lay buried in the churchyard on completion of the work a ceremony was held to mark 
 the occasion and a plaque and ppcli scroll were presented to the congregation with whom we have many ties as 
 many as 50 ex members covering a large span of time were present for this ceremony in the summer of 
 1870 colonel garnet wolsley led a force of british regulars and canadian militia from port arthur to lower fort gary 
 the aim of the march was to assure the settlers and indians of their place in canada and the empire 
 and to guarantee protection after much planning and preparation a group of 35 soldiers from a company duplicated this march 
 the group started out on 19 june and marched six hours a day covering 18 25 miles at the end 
 of each day s march was a bivouac and a hot meal from the flying kitchen at several points along 
 the route the corps of drums assisted the force in the conduct of a brief sunset ceremony and marching display 
 it was a weary but proud group that arrived home on the 13th of july on 12 july command of 
 the second battalion was passed from lcol j h allan to lcol r i stewart lcol allan had commanded since 
 the summer of 1972 and was posted to a staff position in the directorate of land operations lcol stewart no

 accompanying the corps of drums were six members of the unit s pioneer platoon also in full regimental dress including

 large wood canvas canoes they were resupplied at various intervals along the route by an otter float aircraft from 429 
 air reserve squadron on arrival at selkirk the members halted to don 19th century costumes the paddlers were joined by 
 four adventurous wives and a number of children also dressed in costumes next the fleet was increased by adding a 
 life size replica of a york boat with stores and bales on landing at the fort the group was met 
 by some 20 staff personnel also dressed in costumes of the time and served an authentic period meal this arrival 
 and reception was filmed as part of a 30 minute television documentary which is now part of the fort s

 museum which visited various communities from the lakehead to the west coast the caravan was on display from march until 
 the end of august with some 6 000 people signing the guest book the display illustrated the activities of the 
 regiment from pre world war i up to the present and contained displays of weapons uniforms and various medals special 
 mention must be made of sgts wallace and melanson cpl lehr and pte yakielashek who all worked long hours in 
 order to make the caravan a success being constantly exposed to the public as they were is not an easy 
 job and they were a credit to the unit the month of july saw a second valued presentation to the

 serving with the british army in the zulu wars in afganistan and in the south african war pte keenie served

 69 third battalion our diamond jubilee year is over and now it is time to look back and recount the 
 events of that memorable twelve months we lost our colonel in chief lady patricia ramsay at the beginning of the 
 year which addened us all but how fortunate we are that she chose such a person as her odchild the 
 lady brabourne to succeed her our new colonel in chief isited us in august and won her way into the 
 hearts of all the men who are her regiment the cycle is complete with the old being replaced by the 
 new people from all places and backgrounds come and go through its ranks yet the regiment goes on and on 
 1974 saw the end of a legend which is always sad ut we now have a new lady patricia and 
 1975 looks like a great year the diamond jubilee will be mainly remembered as a regimental year however third battalion 
 was also busy with a host of other activities and raining of all types chronologically here is what 1974 was 
 like behind the tweed curtain january was the month of winter exercises for the unit after many delays and time 
 changes c coy finally got off the ground on 14 january enroute to fort churchill manitoba and a 140 degree 
 change in temperature to be the nemy force for 2 ppcli on exercise rapier thrust 111 upon arrival at churchill 
 the company moved into temporary quarters where acclimatization was the order of the day two days later they were flown 
 south of the base to set up a defensive position on the churchill river to try and thwart the friendly 
 forces who pushed south on two axis and finally put in a mechanized attack on the postion captain pat dillon 
 barely made it out of the area in an apc with figsat the mockup satellite which was the point of 
 the exercise only to be captured just a few miles short of safety with his capture exercise rapier thrust 111 
 finally came to an end two days later the company re deployed and soon everyone was basking in the sunny 
 liquid that is climate of victoria meanwhile the remainder of the battalion had gone to the chilcotin area of b 
 c for exercise riske caper this exercise began for most of the battalion after a long but comfortable bus and 
 ferry ride from victoria to the interior of b c the weather was rather mild for the company training phase 
 however a lot of good refresher training was conducted this was followed by a battalion exercise which concluded after three 
 days of practise in the various phases of war the enemy force was finally trapped on a large low hill 
 in a situation very similar to the scenario of a tewt conducted a month previous during officer training the war 
 was over the companies returned to their original bivouac areas for a hot meal and then off to the battalion 
 sports meet held in a echelon s location on the afternoon of the 31st the next day the battalion re 
 boarded its buses for the trip home with another winter exercise under its belt in february b coy with detachments 
 from recce and assault pioneer platoons conducted the first of the quick otter company sized amphibious exercises the company commanded 
 by major curly gentles carried out a successful landing and after two days of tramping through the thick jungle of 
 the west coast of vancouver island took the objective that night it snowed and all ranks were more than happy 
 to return to work point

 when the cease fire was finally called the month of june saw two memorable events the first being the return

 85 regimental band the year s normal routine of concerts parades and mess dinners was fectively relieved by the band 
 s participation in the various celebrations held conjunction with the regiment s 60th diamond jubilee of 1974 the first of 
 these was to have been in winnipeg to participate with second attalion and their exercising of the regiment s right 
 to the freedom of the ty of winnipeg and that battalion s commemoration of the 23rd anniversary the battle of 
 kapyong unfortunately the ceremonies had to be cancelled hen the battalion was called out to fight the floods in the 
 southern part of anitoba in june it was off to victoria where on the 15th the band supported third sttalion 
 on the occasion of the granting of the freedom of the city of ctoria to the regiment in company with 
 that battalion s corps of drums any kind comments were heard as to the musical performance and the remony as 
 a whole the regimental band returned to victoria a couple of eks later and again accompanied by the corps of 
 drums of third ttalion performed for the ceremony of trooping the colour on the ist of ay during the stay 
 in victoria the band managed to present an open air ncert in beacon hill park under the baton of captain 
 l camplin cd tlc ltcl arcm lgsm the concert with it s varied contents was well ceived parks in the 
 evening remain in the opinion of many of the band s embers the finest locations for a concert even when 
 compared to the most mous symphony halls and theatres the highlight of the jubilee year was the week end of 
 the 10th of august at ie home station in calgary the sth of august was the beginning of rehearsals with 
 the corps of drums om all three battalions rehearsals morning noon and evening with mperatures in the 90 s in 
 the shade rehearsals for the trooping ceremony and rehearsals for a retreat eremony the 9th of august was the retreat 
 and no finer performance could aye taken place perhaps the presence of the colonel in chief the lady rabourne dl 
 jp and her renowned father the earl mountbatten of urma had something to do with it perhaps the fact that 
 every musician in he regiment was on parade in full dress sparked that extra effort for erfection whatever the reason 
 the spectators enjoyed it and the musicians enjoyed it it was a fine start to a memorable week end of 
 celebrations the following day the ceremony of trooping the colour was performed igain in as flawless a manner as possible 
 we are indeed proud to have been ible to take such an integral part in the regiment s 60th diamond 
 jubilee throughout the year the aforementioned routine was followed spiced up by some other highlights in february the patricia band 
 and the training command band combined ior a concert performance in winnipeg on which occasion each received standing ovations 
 86 the 11th of july the band supported 1 ppcli in the firing of a feu de jo e as 
 part of calgary s stampede week from the 27th of august to the 2nd of september the band took part

 the famous dancing and singing group the fei foliets the performances took place over five nights before approximate 35 000 
 people in the huge colliseum everyone including the local pre s agreed that it was an outstanding success as a 
 measure of the success was tl congratulations and certificates of merit received from canada s hig i commissioner and the 
 external affairs department perhaps this tour above all others gave the members of the band tl greatest satisfaction there was

 89 the royal green jackets royal green jackets it battalion during the past year 1 rgj has been kept very 
 busy the last four months f 1973 were spent in belfast and the bn is now finishing its training for 
 its fth tour in the province it moves to the border area around crossmaglen and ewry in mid december 1974 
 in june the bn moved back to england from celle the battalion is now in onnaught barracks surely the most 
 windswept corner of kent a few undred yards from the clifftops and dover castle the northern ireland tour in 1973 
 took first battalion to the lower falls rea as a result of excellent work by the glosters the catholic areas 
 were mieter than expected a company in the busiest area had only 23 hooting incidents although the gunmen were to 
 give several soldiers some nemorable near misses they were on the whole young and inexperienced nail bomb in divis flats 
 broke the leg of one soldier and blinded another in ne eye but this balance was redressed soon afterwards when 
 b company hot and killed a gunman a considerable quantity of arms and ammunition ere recovered including a rocket launcher 
 and four rockets this and the arge amount of intelligence gathered and filed produced a very worthwhile tour in january 
 first battalion settled down again to baor soldiering the specialist platoons ran cadres soldiers went down to the 7 armoured 
 brigade iki hut and various adventure training schemes were run during the final weeks in germany the battalion took part 
 in several command post exercises and so ended a tour on the right note 
 90 2nd battalion second battalion was stationed in belize lately british honduras and the task there committed a company group 
 to holfast camp a few miles east c the guatemalen border and the remainder to airport camp near belize cit 
 on the coast one company remained in uk initially a who carried out most successful kape tour in the liverpool 
 area and then c who did si weeks exercise in cyprus in january guatemala has always had a territorial claim 
 on belize and our deploymei was designed to counter any threat to invade or annex any part of the countr 
 in addition to preparing to deal with hurricanes our main priority ws therefore to practice our operational role once established 
 in belize we were able to give more time to training bot military and adventurous to community relations and to 
 take full advantag of the excellent recreational facilities available belize offers good trainin opportunities in particular for jungle training and 
 support weapon live firing adventurous training also produced great scope for imagination an ingenuity amongst the more notable schemes were 
 the scaling of mt victori and an assualt boat expedition down the belize and orange rivers although for many especially 
 the marrieds belize posed problems c separation and communication in retrospect we look back on a mos interesting and enjoyable 
 tour on 2nd march the last aircraft left belize after we had handed over to ou successors 1 rwf and 
 second battalion went on three weeks block leave one week after return to catterick from leave we assumed the mantle 
 o world wide spearhead battalion the more venerable cynics amongst v recalled that the last time the battalion had been 
 spearhead in july 1963 w had been deployed to british guiana in great haste our fears of being deployed proved 
 well founded for within two hours o our taking over as spearhead battalion b and c companies were on thei 
 way to ireland to be employed in border areas on road block operation soutl of armagh after ten days they 
 were replaced by a company who remainec for a further two weeks the period proved extremely tiring for all as 
 roac blocks were manned on a 24 hour basis however we were gratified to receivi many complimentary letters on the 
 diplomatic and efficient way in which thest duties were carried out on the final day a company succeeded ii arresting 
 a man wanted for murder providing a satisfactory note on which tc end our brief tour the turbulence of the 
 past two and a half years meant that we sorely needec a period of relative immunity so that we could 
 concentrate on courses anc cadres during this period many officers and men were sent on all types oi courses in 
 preparation for our next tour in northern ireland due to start or november ist we ran numerous internal cadres each 
 company trained al stanford in norfolk and the support weapons fired at otterburn and we played as much sport as 
 possible during this period following three weeks leave in august and early september we began in earnest our final training 
 for the next northern ireland tour nishan is a word common to turkish and iraniah meaning aim and 
 91 ht and is also the name chosen for the annual cento small arms mpetition the national teams are chosen 
 from a combat unit or regiment d each year a different nation of the five members acts as host this 
 year it fell to the uk to act as hosts and to 2 rgj to provide the team looting started 
 in january and a complete company under major greville odwyn was formed in march from which the final team of 
 24 was to be lected the competition itself took place on 15th and 16th august at bisley oducing the closest 
 ever finish 2rgj finishing second to turkey by 3319 to 23 points such a close finish was it that the 
 results depended on the final ot of the competition the third place team was iran some 60 points behind flowed 
 by usa and pakistan the americans won the rifle although we hieved the highest score ever by a uk team 
 we won the lmg match nishing ist 2nd and 4th in the individual placings bird battalion shoeburyness still remains our 
 home the battalion has become fondly tached to horseshoe barracks despite its forbidding and ancient appearance last year on 25 
 july the battalion embarked on the lsl sir tristian at iverpool to begin one more tour in belfast covering an 
 area astride the falls ad springfield road although quieter than the previous year there were many sniper attacks the amber 
 of explosions has shown a steady downward trend but there appeared be no shortage of weapons and ammunition the battalion 
 was successful in rresting a high proportion of wanted men and recovering a large quantity of capons and ammunition in 
 a particularly hard republican area on 28 november the battalion embarked on lsl sir bedivere sincerely hankful that we had 
 avoided casualties and serious injury during our four nonths january and february of this year saw the bulk of third 
 battalion on ourses and cadres the remainder concentrated on medical and fitness raining in preparation for an overseas exercise in 
 west malaysia the battalion had an exciting eight weeks undergoing jungle training in march nd april on july 25 1974 
 as the lsl sir geraint tied up at belfast docks the battalion started its third tour in northern ireland since 
 it reformed at ihoebury in january 1972 and for the third time it was operating in the upper falls area

 by the colonel of the regiment the colonel of the regiment reported that the battalions have performec magnificently over the 
 past year and that generals waters and browr concur in this observation and have stated that the battalions are highly 
 regarded by ndhq he reiterated his pride in the battalions and tendered his apologies to lieutenant colonel stewart for not

 s choice some years ago as her successor that her choice was approved by the queen and the governor general 
 at that time he expressed joy at her now having been appointed colonel in chief he then requested lady patricia 
 to address the meeting item 7 the colonel in chief s address major munro general ware and brother officers thank 
 you very much for making me a member of the association and for making me feel so much at home 
 i served through the war for three years in the wrens which helps me to appreciate the value of your 
 association i did enjoy my three years in the war this was because i did not have to go to 
 the front and i didn t have the responsibilities of a husband and children as i know almost all of 
 you probably had but this makes me appreciate what an association is for and it does seem to me that 
 it really keeps alive the spirit of the regiment it s easy to keep the spirit of the regiment when 
 you are in it because it is almost impossible not to feel at once at home as i already have 
 in so very short a time since my arrival but i feel it is more difficult when one has to 
 leave and go out into ciwie street it is an association such as ours here that keeps alive this spirit 
 from august the 10th 1914 to august the 10th 1974 and i hope august the 10th a very great many 
 years ahead i really can not tell you how deeply honoured and proud i feel to have been asked to 
 be your colonel in chief i came out here knowing that i was going to find friends and a very 
 fine regiment indeed but i had no idea that i was going to be so tremendously impressed and feel in 
 some most curious way immediately at home amongst all of you i have heard some of your senior officers say 
 how much they do value the association as a means of keeping alive the spirit and showing an example to 
 the young ones and an inspiration for the future years 
 105 perhaps as this is a sort of family meeting i can also say that one of the little side 
 pleasures that i know my father won t mind my mentioning this is of course suddenly and very unexpectedly i 
 have become senior to him but he really has been an absolute model adc i know i can speak for 
 him and say that he has not only enjoyed the visit but he too is coming home with me now 
 with a tremendous feeling of inspiration i have been once before to canada and in fact i came and visited 
 the regiment purely as a very interested guest because of course i had heard a great deal about you from 
 lady patricia and i knew how much she valued this association so i was very interested in 1967 when i 
 visited you in edmonton before they moved down to currie barracks where we are to day but i thought little 
 on that occasion that i should be coming back as a very proud member of the regiment yesterday on parade 
 you were all there and you heard what i said so i won t repeat it except to say it 
 was one of the finest parades i have ever seen one of the best troopings ever i would like to 
 say how much i associate what i said at the time with your association marching past i thought you were 
 simply terrific right up to nearly 90 years old and i now do understand a reference that impressed me very 
 much but that i now absolutely totally understand which is that this very fine and famous regiment has an absolute 
 flair for taking good men and making them into superb soldiers em 8 the colonel of the regiment s reply 
 thank you very much lady patricia magnificent as ever but i am afraid that we must go shortly but before 
 we go i want to say again that in regards the adc how honoured the regiment has been to have 
 lord mountbatten with us these past few days we are grateful to you sir for coming we are very grateful 
 that you have given us a colonel in chief tem 9 appointment of the colonel in chief as patron of

 108 3 the patrician the 1972 publication as reported to you last year was produced by cutting corners in an 
 effort to substantially decrease costs this proved most undesirable and resulted in the production of an inferior quality for our 
 annual journal the 1973 edition produced by the normal commercial methods has been well received but has been published at 
 a loss of 4 378 00 in 1971 the selling price of the patrician was increased by 2 50 and 
 1 50 per hard and soft cover copy respectively this necessitated the request that the branch membership portion of monies 
 collected that are forwarded to the association headquarters be increased from 1 00 to 2 50 only four of 10 
 branches adopted the increase consequently only the members of those four branches receive the annual journal as part of their 
 membership dues this has substantially curtailed the number of copies that are distributed as being sold at the 71st meeting 
 of the regimental executive committee held two days ago the following was recorded the patrician the secretary treasurer reported on 
 the publication of the patrician 1973 and the fact that it would suffer a loss of 4 378 40 there 
 was a lengthy discussion as to the aims and purposes of the journal and the need for it to continue 
 it was agreed that the annual journal should continue in it s present format the secretary treasurer was directed to 
 research and report on all facets of the cost of the publication and determine any possible method of cutting the 
 costs involved it was further proposed that the selling price of the journal be established after the cost is ascertained 
 the secretary treasurer is to explore the ramifications it was also proposed that a more concerted sales pitch must be 
 pursued 4 the regimental newsletter the newsletter continues to expand having now reached a distribution of approximately 1 500 copies

 119 calgary branch 1974 was a good year for the calgary branch even with the membership dropping to a low 
 of 41 the forthcoming year will see the branch striving to once again reach a membership of 100 this goal 
 was reached a few years ago and should be reached again without too much difficulty the present executive committee consists 
 of president jh shinn vice president c kawanomi secretary treasurer j pritchard past president h busch the annual banquet and 
 ball normally held on the 17th of march was cancelled in 1974 in respect to the death of the colonel 
 in chief the lady patricia ramsay in it s place we joined all other elements of the regimental family in 
 attending a memorial service to honour her memory it is with deep regret that the calgary branch reports the death 
 of a former president and extremely active member laurie bullard 2265964 in colonel belcher veterans hospital on the 14th of 
 november 1974 on behalf of the membership of the calgary branch the president jim shinn wishes to thank all ranks 
 concerned for a magnificent display on the occasion of the cermony of trooping the colour and related activities in commemoration 
 of the 60th diamond jubilee again this year a meeting dinner and dance was held in december in the home 
 station warrant officers and sergeants mess this is becoming an annual affair and is proving highly successful visitors to calgary 
 are reminded that this branch meets on the fourth friday of each month less july and august in the warrant

 hold any functions because of the trooping the colour ceremonies being held in victoria and calgary we did hold an 
 election of officers in february and the following were elected joe dunn president wally mills secretary treasurer our membership has 
 dwindled this year however we are going to conduct a recruiting program and hope for more members in 1975 there 
 are many patricia s in edmonton and we hope they come to the fore and not forget that they are 
 patricia s our president attended both troopings and he tells us the performances were superb and the renewal of old 
 acquaintances a memory not to be forgotten there was a good delegation of the edmonton branch at the trooping in 
 calgary and their comments were nothing short of excellent congratulations to all in calgary who made the event so successful

 123 toronto branch 1914 1974 sixty years of service it will be an unforgettable year for the regiment and all 
 who served within its ranks an occasion to celebrate and although we here in toronto celebrated quietly celebrate we did 
 although the passing of our colonel in chief was a sad event for us as it is for anyone on 
 the loss of a loved one it was not entirely unexpected during our annual dinner in may the colonel of 
 the regiment said when speaking to the assembly that from his many talks with princess patricia he knew her to 
 be a firm believer in the here after can you picture that celestial parade square last 17 march the trooping 
 of the empyreal colour and the march past the princess on the reviewing stand with her beautiful smile even brighter 
 than we had ever seen it turned on her troops as they thonged passed led by bill fry and harold 
 belinger with heavenly music provided by pipie colville and all those beaming faces turned toward her it must have been 
 a tumultuous welcome on february 1 1974 we held our annual meeting in the queen s own club to fix 
 up last years mistakes and to try to plan a course that would keep us on the straight and narrow 
 for the next we were pleased to have with us on this occasion lcol phil roy of cfsc and major 
 doug bell of cfss we raised the dues put off the election of officers until a later date put doug 
 bell in charge of the forthcoming annual dinner then we had a buffet lunch fortified ourselves against the elements and 
 ventured forth into the storm april 3 was very cold and windy which was a great disappointment to some of 
 our older comrades several telephoned to say how sorry they were to miss this day but fate family and the 
 doctor had conspired to make it impossible to attend our memorial service was held in st james cathedral here in 
 toronto a beautiful church and the many hanging regimental colours were in keeping with the occasion although we were not 
 a large congregation about 70 there were representatives from all generations world war i 11 korea regular force wives children 
 and friends we were very fortunate to have padre east with us at this time the padre served with the 
 regiment for a time in england and was personally acquainted with princess patricia so he could speak from the heart 
 during the act of remembrance after the church service a group made their way to the cenotaph and in a 
 brief ceremony mgen potts placed a wreath then it was a fast trip to moss park armouries to thaw out 
 emotionally physically and sociably it was a good turn out of patricias past present and future with the potts outnumbering 
 all others may 10 saw a goodly number gathered at the officers staff school for our annual dinner to commemorate 
 frezenberg hitler line and kapyong and any other private battle you might want to celebrate we were honoured to have 
 the colonel of the regiment major general c b ware with us at this time after the reading of the 
 names of our fallen comrades and sounding of the last post played simultaneously with the evening prayer we observed a 
 minute s silence during this time there was a distant roll of thunder and this secretary who had just read 
 off the names had the distinct feeling that someone up there was trying to tell him something the president soon 
 
 124 apprised me and everyone else present of my omission i had neglected to include the name of our most 
 honoured fallen comrade princess patricia mea culpa general ware spoke of conversation he had had with princess patricia and of 
 how proud she was of her regiment he also spoke of her great disappointment at not being able to take 
 a more active part in her later years major yankee running dog bell gave a very enlightening and interesting talk 
 illustrated with slides of his tour of duty with the un truce team in korea he had some very fine 
 pictures showing the un and north korean chinese actually in discussion sic he also had pictures of present day kapyong 
 and other patricia battle areas people who had been in action there found it hard to believe the changes that 
 had taken place and how peaceful it all looked during the summer months the toronto branch was not too active 
 one or two of our people managed to get to celebrations held in other parts of the country but we 
 only had reports from the two that went to calgary cliff naylor and reg williams both were very impressed with 
 the cermonies and the hospitality and cliff brought back all the programmes timetables and newspapers he could get his hands 
 on these in turn were presented at our annual meeting and all had a chance to see what they had 
 missed several members from toronto including myself had indicated they were looking forward to attending the ceremonies in calgary we 
 had a deal going with cpa for a reduced group fare and it was a great disappointment when we were 
 unable to get the required number to take advantage of the cheaper air fare that extra 50 00 made the 
 difference it is a pity that the offer of the 60 passenger hercules aircraft as reported in the december regimental 
 newsletter did not extend to civilians the week end of 5 6 october my wife and i journeyed forth to 
 ottawa to share in the anniversary celebrations there this consisted of a dinner church parade and dedication of the ppcli 
 memorial stone in lansdowne park it was indeed a pleasure to meet other members of the patricia family some for 
 the first time and others for the first time in thirty years the dinner church service and didication ceremony all 
 went off without a hitch and all those responsible can feel justly proud our last do for 1974 was a 
 smoker held on 11 november in the toronto scottish sergeants mess we had a pretty fair turnout during the evening 
 once again we listened to princess patricia introducing the patricia s band playing marches and songs of the regiment which 
 surprisingly some had not heard before and the ppcli 60th jubilee record we also viewed a film of the aforementioned 
 church parade and dedication service in ottawa we have had a fairly successful year here in toronto it is a 
 pity that active membership has fallen off but it is good to know that we still have a solid block 
 of staunch members who can always be depended upon to keep up the fine old patricia tradition of carry on 
 regardless to all patricias everywhere and especially to those still serving at this time we wish god speed and good 
 luck and every success in all your endeavours

 127 united kingdom branch 1974 our jubilee year is now past and while we remember the past we must also 
 look forward to the future which we hope will be a very happy one for the regiment on the 17th 
 of march our members attended the memorial service at the church of st anne bagshot for our late colonel in 
 chief the lady patricia ramsay our beloved princess patricia on 13th of june to celebrate the diamond jubilee we were 
 the quests of commander and mrs nation for lunch at hatch court near taunton we were very interested in the 
 hamilton gault ppcli museum there which brought back memories of the early days of the regiment especially to those few 
 oldtimers who were able to make the journey to be present we were also pleased to be able to visit 
 the nearby church and see the memorial to our late founder and mrs gault after lunch we were informed by 
 vern cole that a new colonel in chief had been appointed but he could not then release the name however 
 the canadian high commission made the announcement two days later and we learned from our daily papers that the lady 
 brabourne had been appointed we hope that lady patricia will enjoy many happy years as our colonel in chief on 
 sth of october a large number of our members proceeded to the church of st anne bagshot to attend the 
 funeral service for colonel v roger schjelderup dso mc cd six of our members acted as honorary pall bearers roger 
 was a good friend to us all and aided by his wife ida did much to help the ppcli as 
 well as other canadian veterans in england we regret the loss of another old member 51432 c h simpson mc
