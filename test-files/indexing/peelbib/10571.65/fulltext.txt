 2 the patrician 2002 vp colonel in chief princess patricia s canadian light infantry message from the colonel in chief 
 the countess mountbatten of burma cbe cd jp dl the year 2002 was without exaggeration a monumental year for the 
 regiment the regimental family was tested as canada committed land forces to the war against terrorism together they met all 
 challenges with great solidarity perseverance 0:perse 0:verance and professionalism i was extremely proud of the successes of my patricias the 
 deployment of the 3 ppcli battle group with elements from the second battalion to afghanistan was undoubtedly the high point 
 of this remarkable past year as expected the soldiers of the battle group performed to an extremely high standard under 
 stressful dangerous and spartan conditions the tragic death of the four patricias and the wounding of others did not deter 
 these soldiers from carrying out their duty and from making a significant contribution to the war against terrorism indeed the 
 tragic friendly fire incident no doubt raised the soldiers determination to persevere and soldier on in a most professional manner 
 they did the regiment and the country proud i was most fortunate along with my husband lord john to travel 
 to canada in march we took advantage of the opportunity to visit our association and regimental friends in victoria calgary 
 and edmonton it was most heartwarming to see so many old friends i was also extremely pleased to meet my 
 good friend freddie bootle and was inspired by his high spirit and determination though later saddened at the news of 
 his death lam heartened by the imprint that he has left on so many patricias he will be much missed 
 in november lord john and i were travelling in south korea and were able to pay a visit to the 
 allied services war cemetery in pusan it was an especially moving occasion for us to see so many canadian soldiers 
 buried there a very large number of whom are our patricias our thoughts were very much with their families in 
 canada the upcoming year holds many challenges for the regiment as the world enters another period of global instability and 
 uncertainty despite the first battalion returning from another successful mission to bosnia and the second battalion replacing them to provide 
 consistent stabilization efforts the regiment may yet be called upon to conduct operations i am certain that despite whatever the 
 upcoming year holds for the regiment the patricia s will continue to provide dedicated professional and stalwart service 
 the patrician 2002 3 vp colonel of the regiment princess patricia s canadian light infantry message from the colonel of 
 the regiment general a j gd de chastelain oc cmm cd ch the year 2002 was an historic one for 
 the regiment with patricias in action in a declared war on terrorism patricias have been in action elsewhere in recent 
 years as in the medak pocket in 1993 for which second battalion was recently awarded 0:award 0:ed the newly designated 
 commander in chief s unit commendation its presentation to the members of second battalion by the governor general in the 
 fall including to the numerous members of militia regiments and units that comprised the battle group was a high point 
 of the regiment s year another high point was the conduct of the 3 ppcli battle group in the afghanistan 
 operation working closely with their american allies members of the battle group demonstrated to canadians and to the world that 
 canadian soldiers have lost none of their professional fighting capability since they were last engaged in war patricias have lost 
 soldiers in all the wars they have fought and sadly afghanistan was no exception the deaths of sergeant marc leger 
 corporal ainsworth dyer private nathan smith and private richard green were tragic as was the wounding of eight other patricias 
 the memorial service held in their honour in edmonton in april was a fitting tribute 0:trib 0:ute to them and 
 to their families and it gave canadians from coast to coast an awareness of their armed forces in a manner 
 unmatched for more than a generation the operational tempo of the regiment remained at a high level at the end 
 of the year with first battalion in bosnia second battalion commencing its preparation to go there and third battalion beginning 
 its post afghanistan restructure and training how that tempo will be maintained remains a subject of much debate at the 
 highest levels within national defence headquarters and the government with the likelihood of an overdue foreign policy and defence review 
 still in question elsewhere at home the ppcli association has remained active in promoting the regiment s interests through the 
 work of its various branches the related efforts of a number 0:num 0:ber of association officers were justly rewarded this 
 summer by presentations of the queen s golden jubilee medal once again this year the regiment has been blessed with 
 the presence of our colonelin chief 0:colonel 0:in 0:chief who made visits to the association in victoria calgary and edmonton 
 in march she and lord brabourne spent time at the home station visiting with the 3 ppcli rear party and 
 with members of 1 ppcli during their march 17th activities we remain continually 0:contin 0:ually grateful for lady patricia s 
 interest in the regiment and for her active support in all that we do as i noted at the beginning 
 of this message 2002 has been an historic year for the regiment patricias everywhere can take much pride in all 
 that their members serving and retired have achieved this year and in the work they continue to do i send 
 my best wishes to them all 
 4 the patrician 2002 rhq vp editor s comments message from the regimental major major e a giraldeau cd being 
 the editor of the patrician has its perks for one thing i get the final say as to what photos 
 will be printed in the final version see below i also get uncontested 0:uncontest 0:ed space to write an editorial 
 this is a valuable opportunity for me as the regimental major to address a significant issue affecting the regiment communication 
 is the key to any organization s viability the regiment is no exception without effective channels of communication both externally 
 and internally the regiment s vision mission and objectives will not reach the intended audience and the message will be 
 lost whereas i believe that the regiment has made great strives in improving our communication methods i know we have 
 a ways to go to prove this point i challenge the reader to state the regiment s vision mission and 
 objectives statement not knowing what they are is one thing not knowing where to find them is something more check 
 the regimental manual the operating plan and the website all members of the regiment need to be reading off the 
 same sheet of music the patrician is an important communication tool the new look to the patrician is a result 
 of feedback from several sources and is an attempt by rhq to make the annual journal more reader friendly comments 
 to rhq over the past years have centered on the desire for more pictures and a larger size so that 
 people in the photographs are recognizable we have not achieved the request for more humour but we have at least 
 tried to lighten up the text the aim is to have a book that soldiers will actually read enjoy and 
 retain it is not intended to be scanned and destroyed or thrown away hopefully we are on the right track 
 to revitalizing the patrician readers comments are always welcomed for those of you who feel the need to criticize yet 
 another change to the size of the journal noted the new size brings the journal to the size of the 
 industry standard for similar pieces there is also a significant cost savings 0:sav 0:ings in production and printing costs in 
 going with the 7xll inch format vice 8 vz x 11 in the end there is always a money issue 
 and as rhq is charged with spending the soldiers money wisely moving to this new size makes good sense even 
 if it does throw a kink into people s bookshelves the spending of soldiers money is another issue that is 
 misunderstood amongst the regiment there is a false sense amongst many that rhq collects hundreds 0:hun 0:dreds of dollars each 
 year from every soldier and squanders the funds away for things that the soldiers will never see or benefit from 
 in some cases there is bitterness when soldiers leave the regiment that they do not receive the gratuities that they 
 paid for if they are in arrears with their voluntary regimental contributions the regimental dues are used to fund all 
 regimental activities not just the gratuity program although this is an important component dues are used to fund the purchase 
 of first issue cap badges and regimental coins regimental achievement awards student bursaries the museum and archives regimental celebrations and 
 festivities and the ppcli benevolent fund which has provided 8 500 dollars in the past two years to assist soldiers 
 0:sol 0:diers in financial difficulties readers can rest assured that your money is being spent wisely 
 the patrician 2002 5 rhq vp as another communication tool the battalions hold a power point presentation that fully explains 
 how regimental dollars are collected and more importantly how they are spent comms are important soldiers at all levels should 
 make great efforts to ensure that our messages are clear and understood both internally amongst ourselves and externally to the 
 rest of the army and to the public we are a strong regiment with lots to say we just have 
 to ensure we use the tools to get our message across to others and ourselves maj scan wyatt looking for 
 love in all the wrong places princess patricia s canadian light infantry well done troops your dedication to serve canada 
 for world peace is sincerely appreciated we wish you success in your future endeavours and safe return compliments of sinclair

 the patrician 2002 15 i vp the first battalion princess patricia s canadian light infantry returning from christmas leave in 
 edmonton the men and women of the first and finest knew that the coming year was going to be busy 
 the moment we walked through the doors of the gg brown building we commenced our preparations for operation palladium which 
 at the time was a mere nine months away operational readiness verifications padre interviews platoon commander interviews and the occasional 
 prod from the doc were a very tangible sign that we were headed overseas of course just getting these very 
 necessary preparations out of the way was not enough so we also threw in a spate of briefings on a 
 wide variety of topics including alcohol and drug abuse bad public affairs important and the upcoming year full as the 
 end of the month drew on we got a well earned break from the monotony of pers adm with exercise 
 strong contender maj drew remembrance day in the bos some have said it doesn t matter if you win or 
 lose as long as you play the game that may be true but as the battalion was fortunate enough to 
 find out winning feels a lot better than losing taking top honours for ice hockey which in the end is 
 the only sport that truly matters the battalion also dominated many of the other sports throughout the tourney winning first 
 place amongst the major units of 1 cmbg sadly with our skills proven for the coming year many of us 
 had to put the sports equipment away until we headed off to the land of bos for with the february 
 thaw such as it was we commenced the pcf courses that gave us the additional skills and capabilities we needed 
 to be able to do the many upcoming 0:upcom 0:ing tasks we faced february and the first two weeks of 
 march passed in a relentless series of classroom lectures 0:lec 0:tures range work and the inevitable deployment 0:deploy 0:ment to 
 wainwright wishing we were in kandahar with our brothers in the third we faced all the wilds that wainwright could 
 throw at us and will probably throw at generations of soldiers to come however before you could say lav 111

 chosen words of wisdom and dismissed us to the garrison edmonton ice rinks when she came out to drop the 
 ball between the officers and senior ncos for broom i loo she got the finest welcome that the battalion could 
 muster accepting it graciously with a smile and a wave sadly for the senior ncos this was about the only 
 cheer that they would hear that day with the officers handily winning the match foreshadowing almost every sporting event that 
 would take place between these two groups of competitors in the coming year and they say getting out of a 
 lav with webbing is hard as march drew to a close many members of the battalion departed for a few 
 days of well earned leave the year was already a quarter of the way on and it was moving fast 
 we quickly ensured that the rucksacks were packed the weapons clean and the vehicles readied for the end of leave 
 meant yet another deployment this time we weren t off to wainwright however it was suffield suffield was bitterly cold 
 for the first week and then it began to blow so hard that you had to gun tape your skin 
 down tents modular and 10 man blue rockets and everything lighter than an litis fell victim to the near hurricane

 op grizzly planning and preparations 0:prepa 0:rations concurrently reconnaissance of the kananaskis area was conducted by battalion and company level 
 r gps the ao was divided up and sub units got on with detailed placement of ops and bivouacs and 
 patrol routes were identified and mapped meanwhile during may a training team of approximately 200 all ranks from across the 
 battalion deployed to wainwright to welcome d coy the composite reserve infantry company and other reserve augmentees for a month

 organization based on respect for the different skills we each brought to the operation the summit went off without incident 
 and the opportunity to form new relationships with the rcmp and get back to some basic dismounted infantry tasks was

 the battle group started pre deployment 0:pre 0:deploy 0:ment leave mid september in early october the company deployed on operation 
 palladium rotation 11 the bulk of the company moved into camp drvar with 6 platoon heading south to take over 
 the camp in glamoc with the handover from 2 r22er complete the troops quickly found themselves conducting patrols vehicle check 
 points and operation harvest weapons collection activities the highlight of the month was the successful securing of a cache of 
 over 100 anti tank and 20 antipersonnel 0:anti 0:personnel mines in a slick combined arms operation fittingly the month ended 
 with a rainstorm of biblical proportion that saw much of camp drvar under six inches of water the tempo in 
 november was extremely high the company participated in operation celeborn a cordon and search with the 1 royal scots battle

 challenge of providing support to the battalion the year started off with support to the primary combat function courses the

 continued to work behind the scenes ensuring that everybody was fed equipped and had vehicles to drive it was a 
 minor miracle that the maintenance personnel 0:per 0:sonnel were able to keep the vor rate so low considering the pace 
 of the exercise and the conditions that we had to work under including the 100 kph wind gusts despite the 
 hard work and many accomplishments of the company the exercise ended i on a unpleasant note as many of our

 the continually required maintenance the re supplying 0:re 0:supply 0:ing of the battalion the medical requirements or the administrative support 
 all members of the 1 ppcli administration company have shown their mettle and proven that like all members of the 
 first battalion we are truly the first and finest rear party with the deployment of the 1 ppcli based battle 
 group to bosnia the 1 ppcli rear party stood up to carry on with the business of the battalion looking 
 after the soldiers 0:sol 0:diers who remained behind and the families of those who deployed major andy gill was appointed 
 as the commanding officer of the rear party a unique feature of this rear party was its size with the 
 reduction of forces in bosnia causing a company and other individuals to remain behind the rear party was larger than 
 several other units in 1 cmbg and may have actually had more patricias in it than were with the bg 
 in bosnia the net result was a large unit with a fraction of the normal staff to support its activities 
 the rear party remained busy throuahout the deployment supporting the activities 0:activ 0:ities of a company on exercise pacing devil

 party was especially busy supporting 0:support 0:ing all training and working hard to carry out the very successful humanitarian 0:human 
 0:itarian affairs campaign realizing the need for specialized support to the families of deployed soldiers the battalion created a family 
 support section with sgt manny mandrusiak at the helm the task was to provide the best and most complete support 
 to the families 0:fami 0:lies that had ever been offered during 0:dur 0:ing a tour sgt mandrusiak took his team 
 of soldiers outside the battalion lines and set up an elaborate drop in center and office in the mfrc building 
 this allowed the families to more easily access the resources and services of the base and mfrc childcare and mental 
 and personal counseling were readily available to those who needed help and no one was turned away the small project 
 grew until it established ties across canada with reserve units and left what would be called the homefront and the 
 tip of the rear party spear the homefront became a source of confidence for both the soldiers and the spouses 
 a neutral place with no unit identification where both could go and vent or be informed about not only activities 
 that the homefront offered but of the other rear parties of the contributing units in edmonton garrison it served as 
 the first point of contact for civilians and wives who were looking for other unit rear parties and worked hard 
 to broaden friendships with the other units the homefront also became the focal point for a massive humanitarian aid campaign 
 to deliver clothing and other goods to bosnia with a little marketing and a few personal touches the people of 
 the city of edmonton and surrounding communities donated almost 200 triwalls worth of donated goods it was such a successful 
 campaign that additional shipping resources had to be marshaled to send the excess to the battle group specializing in lta

 activities for families to partake in and participate in planning involvement of the families at every stage was the key 
 to our success it was a simple idea of giving a little support back to soldiers who give so much 
 every day that grew to be something totally unique and uniquely our own it began with a highly successful 0:success 
 0:ful and well attended family day and open house before deployment and carried on with other activities such as the 
 hallowe en party and kids christmas party the 1 ppcli rear party and homefront set the standard for family support 
 with the unprecedented level of activity and interaction with the families of deployed soldiers the proof of this has been 
 the low number of repatriations for compassionate family reasons and the fact that the leadership 0:lead 0:ership in 1 cmbg

 the week in guam was fun although little hazy but it was good to finally set foot back home to 
 an overwhelmingly appreciative edmonton in early august after the 2 weeks of parades and reintegration the coy was as eager 
 as ever to lead the way off on 65 yes 65 days of well deserved leave air assault b coy 
 returns after another mission in afghanistan c company c company lrp has gone through many changes throughout this past year 
 we started off in mid september 2001 preparing for a normal training year however once the warning order for operation 
 apollo arrived things quickly changed c coy was disbanded and its soldiers were spread throughout the battalion bn to fill 
 any shortages upon the return from operation apollo our incoming commanding officer lieutenant colonel beaudette decided to reconfigure the bn 
 and sub units once again c coy was stood up since our soldiers returned from their disembarkation 0:disem 0:barkation leave 
 the bn has been in a pcf cycle many of c coy soldiers were on course or tasked in support 
 of these courses it was during this time that our officer commanding oc major mills decided that c coy needed 
 something a coy is the parachute coy b coy has always been referred to as mountain coy and c coy 
 was known as the other coy therefore oc c came up with a specialized coy task which focuses on light 
 force capabilities 0:capabili 0:ties he was adamant that regardless of insertion method or terrain the coy would be prepared 0:pre 
 0:pared to fight in any condition thus long range patrolling lrp coy was born wish we had some of these 
 
 40 the patrician 2002 11l vp what does this mean to the coy it has given us the opportunity to 
 develop coy standard operating procedures sop s that focus on patrolling each platoon is tasked with various 0:vari 0:ous tasks 
 skills to become the subject matter experts within the coy since the coy is relatively young in both age and 
 job experience 0:experi 0:ence there has been an col beare inspecting during the 3vh change ot overwhelming rush of ideas 
 command parade anc j suggestions on how to develop the coy from every rank level c coy lrp is now 
 preparing for the new year besides all the normal bn administration that normally follows christmas the coy is focussing its 
 sights on the fort benning experimentation series 5 fbes 5 the coy was fortunate to have sert some soldiers on 
 fbes 4 in november and now the entire coy will be deploying to for benning for the continuation of the 
 experiments the coy will trial new equipment ami capabilities that the military is considering we look forward to testing the 
 personal role radio marconi the digital tactical map display the weapon head mounted gps navigational aid and colour night vision 
 goggles in order to prepare for this tasking the coy is focussing on building team work by rappelling out of 
 ch 146 conducting 0:con 0:ducting unarmed combat training practicing fibua drills and of course patrolling direct fire support platoon the 
 highlight of the past year is no doubt the role that anti armour platoon aaf l played in the 3 
 ppcli battle group s deployment on operation apollo under the command of captain rob lowe and warrant officer bill armand 
 aap arrived in kandahar afghanistan in early february 2002 from the outset the platoon was busy using their tow thermal 
 sights as part of an integrated perimeter defensive of kandahar airfield the troops and equipment were vital in determining accurate 
 spotreps and providing a key role of filling the gaps in the battalion surveillance plan during a period of heightened 
 indirect fire threats against allied troops at the airfield aap provided a dismounted 0:dis 0:mounted tow screen south of the 
 airfield in an attempt to intercept and locate any enemy bm 12 multiple rocket launch platforms this operation was named 
 op devil s watch 
 the patrician 2002 41 11l vp during the battle group s main offensive operation op y harpoon aap deployed as 
 attachments to the rifle companies 0:compa 0:nies and augmented the battle group advance to contact in the mountains in eastern 
 f afghanistan by providing over watch they allowed the battle group to move under cover of machine gun fire to 
 clear caves and sweep the mountain of any al qaeda fighters anti armour s platoon s mission on the whale 
 1 was captured in the battle group print which shows cpl chris durette leading his machine gun section to the 
 crest of the rugged mountain range the real essence of light infantry in may the ever elusive search for osama 
 bin laden took the battle group to the white mountains of tora bora aap proved their value and displayed their 
 diversity by deploying as an indirect machine gun asset using the c 6 machine gun and the c 2 sight 
 the platoon was able to cover possible enemy approaches into the valley with indirect fire from the machine guns although 
 this mission did not uncover the location of bin laden it was successful in that key al qaeda positions were 
 destroyed by mounting the c 6 guns on to the tow jeeps aap evolved into a mounted mg and tow 
 platoon and began the transformation into direct fire support dfs platoon as it exists now during op cherokee sky the 
 platoon executed a road move of approximately 0:approx 0:imately 150 km from kandahar to the town of qalat where they 
 performed numerous security duties when the platoon arrived back in canada the troops enjoyed eight weeks leave before heading back 
 to work and picking up where they left off from afghanistan in developing the role of a dfs platoon within 
 the battalion using lessons learned ffom operational experience dfs platoon remains configured as a mounted machine gun platoon and is 
 integral in providing the battalion with the mobile fire support it requires with new equipment and vehicles on the horizon 
 the future of dfs platoon will be an exciting evolution and learning process as dfs doctrine is developed within the 
 context of a light infantry battalion 0:bat 0:talion signals platoon over the past year 3 ppcli signals platoon faced numerous 
 challenging tasks prior to deploying on operation apollo the platoon developed and supported 0:sup 0:ported all communications requirements for a 
 constantly changing mission during the deployment platoon members rumsfeld and stogran nice suit

 each day recce platoon by the middle of january recce pi was completing pre deployment preps for i s upcoming 
 deployment to afghanistan following a few days of pre deployment leave recce pi was off to afghanistan with the remainder 
 of the bn upon arrival in kandahar recce pi found itself almost immediately deployed to the neighboring gove j nor 
 s compound outside the kandahar airfield this proved to be a fascinating experi t ence op harpoon an operation involving 
 the conduct of an air assault onto a hill feature named the whale followed on the heels of op anaconda 
 the major us i offensive in the hills of shahi kowt valley it was during this operation that our snipers 
 performed with amazing skill and courage under intense enemy fire as word of the snipers performance trickled back to the 
 bn during its final preps for op harpoon the inspirational effect was clearly felt by all once on the ridge 
 of the whale feature 0:fea 0:ture recce pi deployed onto the highest ground with the task of identifying 0:identify 0:ing 
 potential objectives and enemy activity and covering the bn s advance the ground was especially brutal and the progress slow 
 the thin air also added to the difficulty of the movement as we found ourselves at altitudes ranging from 10 
 12000 ft as the bn advanced 7 tell you man a sgt carries his gun like this not like that 
 
 the patrician 2002 43 11l vp there was no resistance although every cave 12 and hole had to be exploited 
 in order to properly confirm or deny the existence of ammunition caches d and or enemy troops all enemy positions 
 seemed abandoned as recce pi moved along the ridge until the very end when c s 64 led by sgt 
 tory white identified 0:iden 0:tified what appeared to be an occupied bunker the objective was picketed 0:pick 0:eted and the 
 coy hasty attack was conducted in textbook fashion resulting in the enemy position being properly exploited and the enemy destroyed 
 the bn soon redeployed after having successfully scoured the entire objective area what i m ready i m ready i 
 m ready i m not ready the remainder of the tour saw the bn deploy on two more bn level 
 offensive operations and a number of smaller coy sized tasks recce pi remained extremely busy participating in these operations and 
 conducting patrols in the area surrounding the airfield of note was the employment of recce pi during op cherokee sky 
 that saw recce pi deploy using unconventional tactics techniques and procedures in order to enter the objective area inconspicuously this 
 drastic departure from established doctrine proved to be extremely successful in the context of op apollo and should ultimately serve 
 as food for animated discussion at learning establishments across the cf upon redeployment from op apollo recce pi enjoyed some 
 much needed rest that being said the pi certainly hit the ground running 0:run 0:ning in october as we launched 
 straight into a basic recce patrolman course before christmas the course was both challenging 0:chal 0:lenging and fun at least 
 for the instructors and it ended the year on an appropriately high note recce leads the way capt watson and 
 sgt gauley winning the hearts and minds 
 44 the patrician 200 11l administration company those who are already aware of administration company s exploits in the last 
 year know it was a year of firsts deployment on op apollo gave us ample opportunity to challenge con ventional 
 ideas and to pusi the envelope on developing and implementing solutions to light forces support ami sustainment that have ney 
 cpl prince all this and money too been faced until now administration company s pre deployment exercise in wainwright was 
 the first time we were able to practice shooting with the pac 4 laser designator system and night vision goggles 
 nvg however as luck would have it the 30c temperatures combined with loose nvg straps caused many of us to 
 return edmonton ready to deploy to the desert with frostbite on our noses on the whale feature during op harpoon 
 we lay claim to having completed 0:complet 0:ed the furthest tactical air assault resupply in us and cdn history it 
 also happened to be the highest tactical air assault resupply recorded we moved 30 000 pounds of material 315 km 
 from the forward operating base to the objective area at an elevatbi of 8 000 feet above sea level we 
 were also the first country between the us and nato that air assaulted a tracked vehicle by 206 into a 
 combat zone it was also the first time a canadian battle group was fully integrated into the us military s 
 support and sustainment system during op apollo administration company held the recognition of being trained and designated as the 3rd 
 brigades riot control force during the transport o local muslims to the haj from the kandahar airfield also notable was 
 that on the rapid deployment for operation harpoon the canadian cooks were tasked to man a section 0:sec 0:tion of 
 the kandahar air field perimeter and almost half of maintenance platoon air assaulted forward to conduct helo landing zone security 
 operations which can only ba assumed is a first for them at least in recent history this last year has 
 been a phenomenal 0:phe 0:nomenal adventure when push came to shove we all rose to the occasion and performed 0:per

 operations jobs in the dcds group and all kinds of things in between no single narrative can encapsulate the experiences 
 of a group composed of such a wide array of ranks employed in a diverse spectrum of jobs and dispersed 
 through out the region having said that our common regimental background 0:back 0:ground provides some commonality of experience and there 
 were a number of events worth noting for the regimental record sadly not all the news was good in april 
 the association lost ken and betty arril later on a number of ottawa area patricias gathered 0:gath 0:ered in lancaster 
 ontario to remember sgt marc leger who fell in afghanistan with three comrades of the 3rd battalion on a lighter 
 note bgen vince kennedy retired this year climbed aboard his ry with wendy and hit the road he now seems 
 to be a phantom reported everywhere by a friend of a friend but never appearing in the flesh we hope 
 the phantom patricia will manifest himself in 2003 long enough to tell a few tales of life on the other 
 side colonel john turner turned over the duties of regimental colonel to colonel dave fraser colonel fraser was employed in 
 the land staff in the reserve restructuring project throughout 2002 except for a sojourn on course in toronto in the

 was cashing a lottery ticket 0:tick 0:et in keeping with long standing tradition the association hosted this year s regimental 
 celebration in march and a regimental remembrance service on november 11th we were graced on the 11th with the presence 
 of gen de chastelain and his wife mary ann along with mgen hewson his wife norah and helen sutherland in 
 addition to association members and serving members 0:mem 0:bers of the regiment a number of remustered 0:re 0:mustered patricias and 
 personnel who had been posted to battalions as support staff turned out to round out the crowd later in november 
 there was a large turnout of local patricias at a downtown ry to meet the cos and rsms as they

 eventually q borden area patricias mwo don schaffel and wo colin caddick few of you likely even know where borden 
 is but it is the largest individual training base in the canadian forces it is also a well kept secret 
 as it is one hour north of toronto and one hour south of some of the best cottage country in 
 canada if this sounds like a recruiting pitch in a way it is in 2002 the borden area patricia num 
 
 the patrician 2002 75 vp bers have dropped off but we continue to hold key ground some of you may 
 wonder why an article on the borden area patricias would show four guys in sierra leone well other than the 
 obvious answer that a picture of me sitting at my desk makes for poor copy keep reading and you will 
 see the connection while our boundary covers all the way to capt turco and wo black up in north bay 
 patricias usually fit into two main areas in borden the canadian nuclear biological and chemical school cfnbcs or rss with 
 the grey and simcoe foresters barrie and owen sound however although we are few the borden patricias have spread our 
 reach into most key areas of borden i am in the canadian forces support training group headquarters major ken orr 
 is in recruit group headquarters and wo noseworthy is posted in to teach instructional techniques at the canadian forces training 
 development centre sgt brooks is still patrolling the ranges as is retired patricia peter mackay which shows you that many 
 options are open and we have an in just about anywhere in the area cfnbcs had a changing of the 
 guard mwo whitehall left to return to the third battalion but mwo schaffel fresh from a tour training the army 
 in sierra leone arrived to take his spot the headhunters finally convinced wo bill johnston to accept a job with 
 a civilian firm producing nbc equipment and training in june he and his family moved down to the niagara peninsula 
 wo caddick came over from rhq to fill his spot sergeant kenny surridge moved from an rss position with the 
 grey and simcoe foresters in barrie over to the canadian forces school of electrical and mechanical engineering after completing his 
 6b course mcpl george aver retired from the cf and capt dale macpherson jumped out of his rss tour early 
 to go to sierra leone and then never came back he has been penalized to a tour as regimental adjutant 
 for leaving us early wo jessop and mcpl sampson are still carrying the banner at the grey and simcoe foresters 
 2002 also saw the departure of major phil cook who had been the cfstg g 3 operations but he too 
 went over to sierra leone and shortly after his return he retired from the cf he and his family have 
 set roots in barrie and still keep in touch so as you can see our limited numbers were connected to 
 sierra leone in 2002 those wanting a posting to borden please give me a call borden specializes in training what 
 we call purple trades those serving all three environments so i see many soon to be ex patricias going through 
 training to become mps medics weapon techs dental techs etc so whether you want a posting or just passing through 
 on training look us up we have the four corners of the base covered so you must be near one

 caudle who have both recently retired after over 20 years of service with the regiment and joined the reserves they 
 received their regimental retirement gifts and are now well settled in the st catherine s area the second purpose was

 a local artist from windsor and were accepted by cpl dyer s father on behalf the families that lost loved
