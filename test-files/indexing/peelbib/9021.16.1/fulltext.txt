 the necessity that exists for a public hall in edmonton the population has now become so large that none of
 the buildings at present available are adequate for the needs of the community as the matter stands a first class
 secular entertainment of any kind cannot be given because no building in the place can accommodate an audience or party
 sufficiently large to make it worth while to get up such an entertainment ‘ a hall built as a private
 speculation would probably be the most satisfactory all around were it proven that the speculation would be sufficiently profitable but
 as the amount of profit could only be determined by experiment and as most of the moneyed men here have
 cvrtainly profitable uses for their money they can hardly be expected to withdraw such a large sum as would be
 necessary from a certain to put it in an uncertain enterprise ‘ probably the most likely way to secure a
 hall during the coming summer would be for all those who are favorably interested in the project either directly or
 indirectly to unite their interests in a joint stock company the incorporation of which would only cost a trifle there
 can be no doubt that with a good hall at command the winter amusements of the place would be more
 numerous more varied and generally better than at present by so much tile pleasures of life would be increased residence
 here would be more attractive than at present and the place would reap a corresponding commercial benefit edmonton bulletin feb
 4 1888 newlyweds by j w christian i did not want to drown my wife but as i saw her
 being carried rapidly downstream perched precariously on a loose wagon bottom i figured that was the way it was going
 to be we had only been married a few weeks and were just getting nicely acquainted she had arrived from
 england just in time for out wedding and all was strange to her on our homestead in june when some
 neighbors told us that the lobstick river was very low my partner george diggins and i decided to inspect some
 hay land we had on the east side of the creek as we called it we thought we would make
 a picnic of it he taking his young son i my newly acquired wife for transportation we had one well

 shot me well above water for a lumber co had opened their log dam moment this gave me the idea

 judging from present appearances calgary is likely always to remain the principal town west of winnipeg its growth during the
 past three years would certainly seem to justify such a belief but in order to make it a certainty our
 people must be up and doing let us remember that we are a sort of distributing centre our traffic with
 edmonton and the red deer on the north the mountains west and the high river and macleod country on the
 south is at present very large it will never do to let it slip away from us already the galt
 road is reaching out for our trade and we are taking no special steps to try and maintain our hold
 on what we have got we have seen prosperous towns become mere wayside stations and again small pushing places have
 risen to importance because the towns people pushed and secured a good hold on the trade of their own country
 in order to build up our trade and prosperity we must have ready means of communication with the country tributary
 to the place and first comes a railway to edmonton this of course includes the red deer country there we
 have coal equal to the galt coal within fifteen miles so easily mined that the farmers drive to the vein
 load their wagons and carry it off this is a source of wealth not merely in supplying the town and
 country at reasonable rates but also for export the galt road was commenced as an adjunct to the coal mining
 but now as a railway it is a good paying property we believe we should be looking forward to a
 road through the crow s nest pass and on to the kootenay lakes this would open as fine a country
 as exists in america containing all the elements of wealth for our people timber iron farming and grazing lands water
 power unlimited and with easy grades and no danger from snowslides who shall say what the possibilities are it may
 be that such a road will connect with a route to hudson s bay at any rate the people of
 calgary should be stirring in order to maintain their hold on the trade of the country calgary tribune oct 7

 was reached and since then things have not been the same the outbreak of the war brought about the reduction
 of the staff to nearly half its strength furthermore it cut off the supply of new men not altogether at
 first but as the seriousness of the state of affairs was realized more fully so it became more difficult for
 men to leave the old country these immediate effects of the great war gave birth to others and men who
 found themselves as parish priests settled in little communities at the beginning of the year had to assume in the
 latter part of the year the role of itinerating evangelists the men of the mission had been drawn for the
 most part from the upper i class homes of england and as true sons of england they rallied to her
