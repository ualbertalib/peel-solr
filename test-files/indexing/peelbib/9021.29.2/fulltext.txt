 the authorities that the oldest proapproximately 12 000 in 1906 to almost 44 000 fession was something that had to
 be tolerated in 1911 industries and commercial enterpr ises because it could not be eradicated if the police expanded rapidly
 the construction business was did crack down on prostitution it was usually due booming and a spirit of optimism pervaded

 the calgar y city council between 1905 fully familiar with either the criminal code or the and 1914 in attempting
 to become involved with city by laws 28 it is no wonder that so few arrests law enforcement against prostitution
 the real were made in connection with prostitution an work was left to the police department understaffed city police department
 consisting during this period the chief of police was largely of untrained men already had enough thomas english who had
 held the position since problems in solving serious crimes and perform 1891 his career during the 1905 1909 period ing

 period from 1910 to 1914 the attitudes towa rds prostitutes were as varied as the fessional policeman in ever y
 sense of the word problem itself social darwinists and other shortly after cuddy became chief his force reformers had their
 own perceptions as to why occupied the new po lice headquarters at 333 7 th women turned to the trade

 a major source of income for ment of city hall 49 chief cuddy also increased women calgary was not a

 convicted and fined approximately poor overtime without pay was excessive and 4000 52 in his annual report for 1914 the
 chief complaints about the work were not tolerated wrote that after his initial raid he had persisted in therefore no

 south coulee and further that any any other source of livelihood would could and keepers who attempted to open houses

 selling their bodies the male population outnumbered the tions as either housekeepers or domestics and females by a large proportion
 and early marri most were in the 20 to 35 year age bracket 57 age for women was considered by
 victorian perhaps the only outstanding feature of calgar y reformers to be a pr ime solution to the problem prostitutes
 was that a significant proportion of the of prostitution these moralists however often american immigrants were black and that they
 neglected the fact that many prostitutes already tended to face more terms of imprisonment than were married in calgary in
 1914 for instance did their white associates out of 91 convictions for prostitution the records another common perception of the
 prostitute revealed that a total of 52 of these women was that she was most certainly a drunk or even
 declared themselves to be married 54 even if worse a user of illegal drugs it is true that public moralists
 and clergymen acknowledged alcohol and dope were almost always associated the fact that women who had been deserted by with
 prostitution in calgar y prostitutes were their husbands often felt compelled to sell often charged with selling liquor without a

 could they provide a feasible records indicate the arrest of an intoxicated alternative keeper inmate street walker or even frequenter
 the double standard of the victorian era con who was the purchaser of the illegal booze the sidered that sexual
 experiences for a man if not records reveal that no matter what time of day the excessive were an attribute
 to his general dev arrest was made all those brought in were sober elopment while similar experiences for a these
 same records also show that there were a woman were looked upon with shock and seen as la rge number
 of convictions for the illegal use and the loss of all that was good and noble thus if a purchase
 of opium but once again the prostitutes young girl lost her virginity in the early 20 th were not included
 in that number opium dens century and this fact became generally known were run by men and frequented by men
 no she was degraded chastized and finally ostra women were cha rged with the illegal possession cized from society if
 she was married and was of the drug still the reformers and citizens in then deserted she faced the same
 public reaction general believed that drinking led to drug abuse if prostitution became her means of support and that both
 ultimately caused women to plunge into a life of sin they also believed that the most significant factor which caused
 prostitution could not exist without either alcohol women to turn to prostitution was their inferior or drugs so the reform
 movement in western economic opportunity and position within canada made a concerted effort to rid society of society in addition
 those who were not drawn the vices caused by rapid urbanization liquor into the trade because of economic necessity drugs
 and prostitution simply found the call of wealth too strong to resist just how lucrative business prostitution the reform movement
 was an outburst of really was in the 1905 19 14 period is difficult to victorian morality which took its
 credence from determine but records show that the ladies of the the prevailing attitudes of protestant christianity evening paid their
 fines returned to prostitution it called forth all men to find the meaning of after prison sentences and were at
 least certain their lives in seeking the realize the kingdom of of a roof over their heads god in the
 very fabric of society it also bor who were these prostitutes the average rowed much of its code from evolutionar
 y litera respectable calgarian would be almost certain tore so that social darwinism became an integral to state that they
 were foreigners the great rise in component of the reform movement one reformer applying darwinism to her call to stop
 immigration in the last decade of the 19 th century caused canadians to view these new arrivals as a prostitution
 voiced her plea in the following threat to anglo saxon security the fact is how manner ever that the number
 of foreign prostitutes was secure in the knowledge of evolutionary processes we have learned to talk glibly of the obligations
 of race by far a minority 56 it was the anglo saxon who progress and the possibility of racial degeneration
 most often became the prostitute and it was also may the new conscience gather force until men her male counterpart
 who paid for her services in and women acting under its sway shall be con calgary the majority of the
 prostitutes were strained to eradicate this ancient evilp american immigrants followed closely by wo in calgary the strongest crusade was
 against men from central canada and a few from britain alcohol because drunkenness was by far the most the majority
 of these women listed their occupa visible crime against morality and also the one living that could not be denied
 the hard lines in some of the countenances bespoke inherent depravity while on others it was not difficult to see
 that environs were responsible reports of prostitutes themselves seemed to suggest that r eformers should leave them alone and concentrate
 their efforts on the innocent youth one lady from the red light district said that prostitutes should be given a
 segregated rea of the city with strict regulations for operation this would keep the girls from spreading through the town
 they cannot be stopped from going to hotels with men and many young girls would be corrupted tm her reasons
 for making such a statement were obviously to keep the police from closing down the district in which she was
 employed but the idea that youth should be protected from vice was emphasized another reason that reformers were not anxious
 to waste their efforts on individuals was that whenever they attempted to do so disappointment was their usual reward prostitutes
 were visited in pr ison on a regular basis but as the officials reported there was little that could be
 done for them aside from conducting gospel services and showing them at every opportunity that someone wished to help them
 when released they always return to the places from which they came calgarians were more optimistic about preventing the social
 evil than saving individual prostitutes rev george kerby said that the churches should get busy and offer young women suitable
 activities for their free time and places where they could meet decent young men without the possibility of corruption 66
 women were viewed as the backbone of the society which the social gospel attempted to improve women were the bearers
 of children the keepers of the family and the upholders of morality girls were reminded of the dos and don
 ts of morality through temperance leaflets young girls were to dress modestly avoid the use of slang when speaking and
 above all they were never to take an intoxicating drink they were to be cautious about dancing and should not
 consider any da nce hall as a respectable establishment they should avoid the five cent theatres and moral young girls
 never wasted time by reading trashy novels 67 undoubtedly western canadia n reformers were naive in their thinking about prostitution

 wctupapers 911 1970 advice to women leaflets gun fight for some time past there has been bad blood between two
 cowboys on the walrond ranche named respectively thomson and cha rlie wright this finally culminated in a dispute which occurred
 last week in a corral on the ranche thomson seems to have been the man who fotted the fighting wright
 repeatedly saying that he did not want to have any trouble thomson insisted upon fighting and both men pulled their
 revolvers at the sa me moment three shots were fired by each party the first two did not take effect
 on either side at the third shot the fates went against thomson his opponent wright was not hit but he
 thomson received a ball in the left shoulder which at once placed him hors de combat immediately after the shooting
 in which both men displayed an abundance of that quality known as sand wright bid a tender farewell to his
 old stamping grounds and mounting a horse struck out for montana he no doubt had a pleasant trip and we
 trust arrived quite safely the wounded man was at once brought to macleod and taken to the police hospital dr
 kennedy trailed up the offending ball and took it out just under the left shoulderblade we are pleased to hear
 that the patient is doing as well as could be expected under the circumstances shooting seems well on the highway
 to becoming a common pastime in the vicinity of macleod it is a matter of conjecture as to how long
 it will be before such events are chronicled not in big head lines as something out of the ordinary but

 the paper they certainly threaten to become very common the macleod gazette july 21 1885 memories of an english settler
 by gladys m rowell in may 1903 our family which consisted of on the sheltered deck where we got to
 know my parents mr and mrs john s stephenson some of the other passengers the sea was calm three brother
 s and me emigrated to canada from and the air a real tonic to our appetites but then the north
 of england the oldest boy was 16 and it became stormy the ship began to roll and so i the
 youngest was ten the excitement of the did our stomachs we soon found that seasickmove left deep impressions on my
 childish ness had not been underestimated by our young mind for i remember most of the details con cousins we
 two younger ones norman and i nected with the decision to come the prepar were the worst and i remember
 norman saying ation and the trip itself my father though that he just wanted to die all of us were
 sick possessing a good education had not made the with it to different degrees except my father best of many
 opportunities and had decided like who evidently had built in sealegs as he never many others to tr y his
 luck in a new country just missed a meal opening up there he expected he could get free after a
 few days the worst was over and my land and practically pick up gold along the way father took me
 up on deck with him to see the big sides waves they were tremendous and when in the for some
 weeks before our departure the trough of them the spray washed over us on the family was divided among different
 relatives deck it was frightening but somehow glorious while our home was broken up and preparations nd as we ploughed
 steadily on through it i lost made my br other norman and i went to an old all fear and
 never spent any time below if i could maiden aunt who though kindness itself had no be on deck the
 rest of the family all came up understanding of children not our kind at least wanly and passengers found their
 way back to she must have thought us most ungrateful little the tables again there was one death among the
 wretches as we spent most of our time in crew from what cause i do not know but it was
 anguished homesickness how we suffered it ver y sad listening to the burial service before the was pure bliss to
 reunite with the family after shrouded body was slipped over the stern of the what seemed a long time of
 separation we were ship showered with advice gifts of money and much warm clothing before embarking i remember the sea
 calmed down and the rest of the trip the ribaldry of my young cousins who liked to was more or
 less enjoyable for me we all formed dramatise in great detail the seasickness we were friendships mine was with joan
 boggs a little about to endure irish girl about my own age which turned out to be a lifetime friendship
 she had bright and merry with the fmal goodbyes came a few tea rs as blue eyes a curly brown
 head of hair and wore a we left by train for liverpool from where we red home made mother hubbard
 dress with an embarked on the dominion considered a good uneven hem we were friends from first glance ship of
 its time we had been alloted cabins far her mother was the widow of an irish major down in the
 bowels of the vessel where we got there was an older brother with her and others established and several hours
 later we finally were moving we were off to the wild and wooly west just about as unsuitable material at
 that mrs rowell was involved in telephone work after time as could have come to it leaving school and later
 taught backward children after the death of her husband in 1972 she retumed to everything was fascinating and new and
 kept her earlier love of writing she is a resident of us roaming the decks for the first few days
 as we calgary explored everything we were allowed to or sat harbour at montreal here there was a long wait
 on the docks to go through customs and a rough drive over cobblestoned streets to a hot hotel where we
 found we had to wait two days before we could get a train to the west because of the heat
 we didn t see much of the city which looked from where we were to be all up and down
 hill it was a relief when we finally entrained though we were sorry to say goodbye to the young englishman
 and others who were not going our way it was a consolation however that the boggs were accompanying us mrs
 boggs pat and babs which was joan s pet name all had a lively happy sense of irish humour and
 were always enjoyable company i have often wondered what the thoughts of such as my mother and mrs boggs must
 have been when they were confronted with life on the emigrant train which did not provide much in the way
 of privacy or comfort they both had been used to a more or less comfortable way of life with servants
 to shield them from the harder aspects of it on the train the seats were of wooden slats and one
 laid what bedding they had on them there was a stove at one end of the ca r with wood
 provided to fire it up on top of which were left behind they were on their way to join yet
 another son who had come out two years before on his own at the age of 16 so we would
 be travelling with them all the way to alberta the captain must have taken a fancy to joan and me
 because sometimes when up on deck he would take either of us for a promenade which inflated our egos a
 bit as he was quite young and handsome also a young englishman coming out on his own liked to take
 us one on each arm and do the same he teased us a lot and we became quite attached to
 him below us on the third class deck were russian poles we were told they would lie about on their
 deck dressed in sheepskin coats with the wool inside looking like a lot of bales we spent some time watching
 them and sometimes dropped ship biscuits or other things down on them to try and get reaction they fascinated us
 by looking so different from anything we had seen before as we got nearer to the coast of canada we
 came into the region of icebergs and watched one floating and towering majestically not too far away here we moved
 very ver y slowly and it was with a sense of relief to everyone when we found we were in
 the mouth of the st lawrence where a tug picked us up and guided us into the was a kettle
 which could be boiled for tea or coffee the other families were all foreigners so it was hard to communicate
 with them and this took some arranging although father managed this part for ourselves and mrs boggs our food was
 kept in a tin box which was only the bare essentials and which were replenished at the longer stops on
 the trip it comprised mostly of bread and with the heat very oily butter made into sa ndwiches with corned
 beef or other tinned meats and oranges or apples at night none of us really undressed there was not enough
 privacy the blankets we had were put to use to make us as comfortable as was possible with my short
 body i was able to stretch out fairly well on the one seat but mother could not have done it
 so easily on the other one opposite it took something over a week to reach calgary and it was not
 uneventful in ontario we passed through a lot of heat fire and smoke where they were burning off the brush
 at the sides of the tracks getting into manitoba we met one of the worst blizzards ever experienced there we
 saw herds of cattle bunched in tightly against the fences along the right of way and then coming into winnipeg
 we passed piles of dead frozen ones where they had been dumped out of box cars after starving to death
 we had progressed very slowly as the huge drifts had to wooden bedsteads after the cramped quarters be cleared at
 times from in front of the train and on the train this was almost luxurious the i suppose this accounted
 for the starvation of the station agent and his wife who lived in a small cattle then in saskatchewan we
 got into floods house nearby were very nice people and showed where the storm had passed over and the snow
 great kindness mrs wynn invited us all for melted at times the tracks were submerged with supper that first night
 the others in the hall were water and here we also proceeded very slowly foreigners and not very compatible mrs
 wynn and with caution by this time mrs boggs and informed mother of some other quite different mother were beginning
 to exclaim quite often type of foreigners that inhabited that place and wondering just what kind of a country they
 had mother took prompt action she purchased upon come to but we finally reached our destination advice quantities of sabadilla
 powder and other on may 24 th and in alberta the weather was horrible smelling stuff nd so saturated all
 our glorious most of our fellow passengers had left clothes and possessions with it that we dripped us at winnipeg
 and other points a nd now affec and smelled of it for weeks it was unpleasant but tionate farewells separated
 us from the boggs preferable to american bedbugs as they were who took the local train to olds to join
 the son called at that time and mother won out mr there wynn gave father and my oldest brother john
 the cpr at that time provided a place called work laying out and planting the cpr gardens the emigration hall
 just across the tracks from behtnd the then new statton after a few days we where the palliser hotel now
 stands here the moved into some rooms in a block on stephen emigrants could stay until they got oriented avenue
 whtch was only a little better although i think there was a time limit it was a accommodation pretty rough
 affair but money was limited there was a level crossing at first street west mother had our fortune which was
 something where one walked over to stephen avenue on a less than two hundred dollars tucked in a small boardwalk
 if one looked away to the west at the pouch pinned into the top of her corset as the rockies
 there was an unobstructed view as far as hall was free here we took up our abode there buildings were
 concerned the mountains lookwas a large room downstairs furnished with a ed so clear and close that we felt quite
 sure that rough table and chairs and a stove where food we could walk out to them as ma ny
 did when could be prepared the upper floor was divided they first arrived it was hard to believe they into
 cubicles with straw mattresses on the were some 50 miles away stephen avenue pet when the stephensons arrived in calgary
 they were given temporary work in the cpr park shown above ered out about third street west where there and
 crying away behind my brothers terrified i was a small dairy that interested my father as he would be left
 but the conductor patted my head had had experience of managing one in england and swung me up the steps
 saying he wouldn t going east he avenue extended down almost to leave such a pretty little girl behind that
 was the mounted police barracks north there were a most soothing few streets straggled down to the eau claire then
 we went to olds where my brother met us mills by the river and south of the tracks there with
 a team and wagon and we were in for another were scattered houses along a few streets and new experience
 how a 16 year old boy could avenues then except for the holy cross have learned so much about horses
 in such a short buildings it was all open prairie out to the elbow time a nd be entrusted to
 come in alone was river there were many hitching posts and amazing after loading up our bags and boxes railings
 where wagons and buggies of various and picking up other items he had been told to get kinds were tied
 up along with saddle horses and we started off north west and were soon out on an perhaps a few
 indian ponies without saddles open prairie trail it was another glorious day of there also were a lot of chinese
 who wore sunshine and all went well until we came to a pigtails they ran practically all the restaurants creek
 that had to be forded my brother now and laundries and many acted as cooks on the informed us we
 might get stuck and so we did ranches i was frightened of them for some reason the creek was not
 very wide but with deep and if they tried to talk to me when i was alone i sticky mud
 in the bottom and with very steep left them in a hurry perhaps it was my curls sides he team
 after trying and floundering which attracted them mother always managed to couldn t get their footing to pull it further
 and just keep hem in order no matter how much stress of lay down they had been here before and
 so had life there might be anyway the chinese cer john i can still see those black shiny backs as
 tainly played a very useful part in he society of mother and i looked down on them from the high
 that time wagon seat john s boss had been driving when we soon received a letter from mrs boggs the
 sa me thing happened a few days before so telling us that she and her son had taken up land
 john knew just what to do mother had to unfurl near he red deer river widows could home her sunshade
 a nd we all walked the plank in stead in those days she urged us to go up and shape
 of the wagon tongue down right between settle beside them also there was ajob at lano s those shining black
 backs and that oozy mud farm for my oldest brother if he wanted to ta ke the where father waited
 to carry mother and me to place of her son jim we decided to go but my safety then john
 pulled out the pin that held the father wanted to look over the country south of singletree and with the
 load removed the team calgary where he had heard there was ver y good was able to splash its way
 out then fastening a farming land so we all went to high river on the chain to the end of
 the tongue and to the team train one morning the day was perfect and when again out ca me the
 wagon we arrived at the the train stopped we found a number of indians in lano farm in time for
 john to help with the their buckskins and blankets squatting a round on milking which he had quickly learned to
 do also the station platform when my mother alighted and we did full justice to the supper his wife dressed
 ver y daintily and unfurled herpretty lilac prepared afterwards we were all bedded down frilled sunshade she made quite an
 impression mostly on the floor as the house did not provide all eyes were upon her and there were some
 grins much accommodation but no matter how hard and laughs curiosity overcoming one elderly the bed i feel sure everyone
 slept well indian woman she got up and by gestures she as had been arranged beforehand the next made my
 rather flustered mother to understand day we moved into the bomgard place a half that she wanted to know what
 made the umbrella mile away it was a small log cabin which was open and close mother demonstrated once or
 thought to be abandoned as the owner had twice and the woman showed great interest and disappeared shortly after building
 it on his homepleasur e appa rently telling the others about it and stead and was supposed to have joined
 the gold occasioning more smiles later the train rush to the yukon tucked cosily under a hill it returned from
 its run to fort macleod and i had two small rooms with a narrow hand hewn remember a wild dash
 from the bakeshop where staircase of logs leading to a tiny under themy brothers and i had gone to buy
 some buns eaves bedroom over one of them there was a hearing the bell i arrived at the station breathless
 small stove of sorts a nd tin pans and plates a rough made table and bench a few shelves and
 needless to say this was a very pleasant reunion an equally rough stand for a bed our boxes and for
 mother supplies were unloaded and after a little cleaning there was one factor that kept us slightly was done we
 were settled in for the time being at apprehensive that mr bomgard might not have least in our first canadian
 home we young ones altogether abandoned his place and might return were charmed with it all and soon knew every
 to it sometime and so when we were awakened foot of the valley which lay like a cup before the
 in the middle of the night by someone banging on cottage encircled by a strem a nd literally the door
 and shouting mother clutched me in carpeted with wild flowers as summer unfolded terror for a few minutes until we
 found out it was each kind into bloom oh the pure air of that father who had walked out from
 olds and had prairie breathing the perfume of those flowers come to take us to high river he had filed
 on a wherever one went we soon found a swimming quarter of land which he maintained was the hole in
 the creek and reveled in it in the best in alberta and so after regretful goodbyes meantime father had looked
 over the land that the boggs dr ove us into bowden to catch the was still available and decided that
 he liked the train so that was the end of that chapter high river district better besides he already had
 been offered work on a ranch there so he mother had agreed to act as cook at the place went
 back to look it over where father was employed though how she ever could have thought of undertaking such a
 job is the lanos were north of us and we soon beyond me the chinese cook was quitting found out
 that to the west our nearest neighbours something we found out that happened with were the adsheads he was the
 school teacher frequency the owners were a middle aged who later beca me a member of pa rliament in couple
 he english and his wife the daughter of a ottawa they proved to be very kindly people wealthy manufacturer in
 the east and they who brought out any supplies we might need if owned quite a large amount of land
 the home they were going into town once a week we place was on the banks of the highwood river
 made a trek over to buy butter and eggs from some seven miles from high river we were met them
 and they freely gave us skim milk and lots by the owner who drove mother and i out in a
 of vegetables from the lrge garden so that we smart two wheeled gig the rest of the family always came
 back well laden came in a wagon there were three houses on the to get to the adsheads we had
 to go down ranch really four with the bunkhouse a large through a fairly steep ravine with a small stream
 stone one which was opened up only for enterto step over at the bottom and a winding trail up taming
 a neat white log bungalow where the to where their house stood some grown sons did owners lived and the
 main eating and dining the farming but there was a younger boy that i p lace where mother and i
 were established they could play with were childless and had not much liking for children we soon found out i
 don t remember the i loved those visits down through the man ever speaking to any of us although the
 coolness of that ravine the welcome we always woman sometimes spoke to me got tea and home baking that was
 ready for us prepared by mrs adshead and her daughter mother was supposed to cook for the foreman rose they
 were halcyon days for us children and two or three others that were in the bunkso free so healthy and
 so different house as well as set and serve the owners who ate alone in the dining room sometimes they
 wanted the boggs from some eight miles away at red lodge often visited us and there were something special cooked
 for themselves alone mother was also supposed to keep everything always happy reunions mother also wrote to dr clean and
 dusted every day and mrs michael clark as she knew they were in that district he had been our family
 physician in if it had not been for the foreman she could england and had come out some years before
 never have done it he was kindness itself and dr clark had become a member of parliament liked us all
 he taught her how to make bread and was down in ottawa he was better known although a good supply
 of that was brought out as red michael because of his fiery red hair from town at times pancakes and
 other staple and the way he made the sparks fly when he items of canadian cooking i remember her falspoke
 down there i suppose he was the first of ling back on mrs beatton s cookbook quite what was later
 known as the ginger group often and producing something from that high river seen here in the early i 900
 s became the marketing town of the stephensons after scouting the olds district for a homestead english standard source for
 a change we lay between the two houses stan who was alchildren wer e all supposed to help her with
 ready doing small chores about the place for the dishes vegetables etc and i had to serve the foreman was
 all fired up at the thought of our first dining room sometimes i hated doing it being a paid job
 we tackled it with enthusiasm which shy child there was a small creek nearby and the soon dwindled from hot
 day to day the garden river only a short distance away and i was at the was overrun by wild
 mustard which was a hard age when active play nd all outdoors was such a weed to pull but we
 persevered bouyed up by the pull that i was forever yearning to be outside and thought of what we would
 get for it when the job free from any of our chores however mother was done not a weed could
 be seen and we went managed and apparently pleased them to the bungalow to tell her she kept us waiting
 while she went back in and then came back to pay i remember two incidents of the time one occurred
 when she was setting in my curls in the us with never a thank you i m not sure if
 it was a morning brushing and turning them over her quarter between us or a quarter each anyway i know
 both our parents were plenty mad and so fingers the lady came in and in her dominant way she said
 oh you should just cut it short were we i think that finished mother as far as that ranch was
 concerned but haying was in progr ess like the boys far less trouble for you i was and she carried
 on until it was over delighted with that idea and kept at mother until she let father come in and
 crop me off but when i towards the end father never a good horsesaw mother s rueful look at the
 curls as she held man let the team run away with the rake and them up carefully preserved for the
 rest of her smashed it up a bit the owner who was directlife and felt my stubby head i burst
 into tears ing things was furious over it and said he would i was still crying when the foreman walked
 in he take the cost of repairs for it out of father s exclaimed oh what a sha me to
 cut off those wages but the foreman away that day said that pretty curls and dropped a quarter into my
 the team of flightly colts should never have been hand that meant a lot tome and helped to dry my
 hitched to the rake in the first place and that tears father had done well to save himself as he
 might another time the woman suggested that per have been badly hurt the end came when the haps norman and
 i could weed the garden and she indian woman who cleaned up once a week would recompense us for it
 it was a large one that didn t appear and the woman suggested that mother had better go over and
 clean up the and a sheet saturated with carbolic solution was bungalow if not the big house hung over the
 open doorway no one ever knew that i had the sickness except the family who father went into high river
 and got a job at a butcher right away having run a butcher shop were not allowed near me we
 needed any for a while in england and having been partner in money that was coming in and could not
 afford an auction mart he took rooms above morn to be quarantined son s grocery store and though the ranching
 shacks were going up like mushrooms all couple tried to get mother to stay we moved into around town and
 on the strength of money he town my oldest brother kept on working but expected to get from england father
 arranged to the rest of us started school right away in the get enough lumber on credit then with the
 help small stone schoolhouse i didn t fare too badly of a man with some carpentering experience he but at
 first my brother s who wore the plus four built one too when it was far enough along we type
 of pants were regula rly chased home by the moved in with great pleasure most of the shacks other boys
 all yelling english bags built at the time were just outer shells with no inside finish and were protection from
 the ele there was a big house close to the school with ments but not from the cold most got
 added to a large garden and two or three of the girls who and made warmer at a later date
 but some ended asked me to join them went over regularly in afternoon recess time to knock on the door
 up as barns and chicken houses ours was div when it opened they chanted please mrs ided roughly into two
 rooms as a great blessing it was a mild winter no turkey no gifts for parrot can we have a
 carrot and she would christmas but i remember on that day and also laughingly reply yes mrs parrot will give
 new years we wandered over the prairie withyou a carrot then we would each pull one out coats of any
 kind to where the indians were wash it under the pump and barely get it eaten before school was called
 again encamped the tepees some 20 or so were of great interest to us the hobbled ponies around i remember
 something else connected with them and the activities of the women and childvegetables we were told to write all the
 ren were fascinating to observe it made a vegetables we could remember on our slates and beautiful scene against the
 backdrop of foothill i put down scallions hen the teacher came to and mountain peaks which always seemed so check
 my work she said there was no such much closerthan they were owing tothe pure unword i was too shy
 to speak up but when she sullied atmosphere came to norman s slate she found he had the along in
 february norman got scarlet fever same word and she said what do you mean by and dr stanley having returned
 from his honeyscallions he replied onions but she only moon put us in quarantine the neighbours comlaughed along with the
 rest of the class this pletely shunned us even to the extent of saying was too much for me so
 i shot up and said yes we should not be getting our water from a nearby little green onions and
 we ate lots of them in well however the doctor put his foot down on england a nd sat down
 feeling very brave she that father ever the optomist had bought two hesitated and then said well we don t
 call cows on the expectancy of his money arriving them that here we were dubbed scallions for and had been
 selling the milk his customers now the rest of the term refused to buy any so we at least had
 plenty of the winter progressed with some episodes milk and cream to drink however when father s which added to
 mother s daily routine and expected money did not materialise the cows and anxieties i remember father being laid up
 with a the house went back to the previous owners and sprained ankle for a week or two he greeted
 the lumber yard a somewhat humiliating expereach issue of the eye opener with glee and ience chuckling over it but
 mother was not too sure of we moved out onto the homestead in the spring some of bob edwards humour
 then i took of 1904 the conditions were that if you were l 8 scarlet fever and as dr stanley
 was down east at or older you paid the ten dollar registration fee the time and there was no other
 doctor within promised to break ten acres each year and live on miles mother had to handle the problem alone
 it six months of each of the next three years with the advice of mrs beatton who provided having complied
 with these conditions you could medical advice as well as recipes in her cook prove up at the end of
 the three years and book i was isolated in one of the three rooms receive the title it sounded much
 easier than it turned out to be in some cases there was land to i will never forget that first
 trip out to the be had at the time much nearer to town but my homestead when mr woodhouse drove
 mother ever impractical dad had ta ken up his homestead and me in his democrat and with a good brisk
 some 16 miles south west of high river it was team of young horses there can be no more beautiful
 land with a gently rising hill on the beautiful view anywhere in alberta than on that north end which gave
 it a southern exposure and drive going towards the mountains i saw their a slough bottom in one corner which
 provided ever changing tints of blues and gr ays under a wonderful hay crops each year it was my job
 in wispy cloud the rolling foothills rising up in later years to drive the gentle team and rake up their
 greenery to meet them all the ranches lay that hay how i loved the glorious smell of the along the
 river bottom of the highwood but after new mown field some miles we left fences behind and drew away over
 the rutted old bar u trail in a south westerly before moving out we stayed for a short time direction
 here we were on the wide open prairie with the woodhouses they had moved up from where we saw a
 few ra nge cattle grzing and one the dakotas in the fall and had built the usual or two distant
 homesteaders buildings hen shack banked up with ea rth to make it warmer we finally arrived at our destination we
 found he was building a large house on the land he had father and the boys in a snowy white
 tent pitched taken up some two miles from father s home under the rise of the sloping hill here an
 even stead he had also bought more nea rby land and more beautiful vista of mountain and foothill was getting
 it all fenced in so father and john rose before us were engaged to help mother helped mrs the much
 travelled boxes were piled under a woodhouse who had undertaken to boa rd a few piece of canvas beside the

 rp hanage school for hunter had a small garden at the north east end of all the stoney women i
 knew she spoke the of rabbit lake which flourished in spite of the best english and showed the greatest poise
 pocket gophers however one day as i rode past jimmy patterson repaid the hunters with vegeon my way to my
 camp i found a number of tables from his own garden and elizabeth and i cattle had entered the garden
 through the poor became good friends fence made of cable strands from an abandoned later when we moved into a
 log house on oil well they had pulled up more vegetables robinson creek elizabeth was a frequent visithan they had
 eaten so after driving the animals tor whose company i always enjoyed she was a out i picked up a
 turnip a carrot and an onion and small handsome woman whose features were took them to camp when i told
 laurie that the quite unlike those of most stoney women to cattle were branded with a t 2 quarter circle
 he me you look more like an iroquois than a said that they belonged to jimmy patterson of stoney i
 told her one day she laughed and grand valley said i am part iroquois in olden times many when i
 met elizabeth and judas driving north with team and wagon i gave them the news and told them that i
 had taken the three vegetables i tiii i 1 t johnson came to calgan from woodstock out in 1912 and
 taught in country elizabeth said ‘‘ you are very welcome to them schools in 927 she married laurie johnson and
 help yourself whenever you need them i lived west of cochrane until their retirement to thanked her rather surprised by
 her courtesy and calgar above is a stoney camp at banff in 950 address it was apparent that she had
 been a good iroquois came with the explorers and some were french or english it was certainly a very stayed
 in the west one of my ancestors was long time ago iroquois she said that the grass along the ghost
 river my daughters donna and peggy wore their flats used to grow very high once when the hair in two
 braids i like the way your girls stoneys learned that the blackfoot indians were wear their hair she said quite
 seriously coming that way they set fire to the grass the your peggy looks just like our little daughter wind
 was from the west and the fire swept rapidly who died she was our only child i often toward the
 enemy who retreated before the fire noticed her looking sadly at peggy our blue reached them eyed blonde whose features
 were so like those of she told me stories of their life before the the hunter child coming of the
 white man to start a fire they while we took our tea elizabeth sometimes struck a spark with flint stones
 you have seen told me stories of the past she said that the in the woods a fallen spruce tree
 rotted till it is stoneys although related to the warlike sioux justyellowpowder lnodded that is what we were of all
 the western indians the most used a spark on it immediately makes it burn so friendly to the first white
 men who came long we carried some of the powder with us ago she said a party of stoneys travelling
 on the you have been to horse lake she conprairies had met some white men for the first tinued i
 said that i had a small type of willow time and made signs of friendship to them they grows there
 from its leaves we made tea she were able to trade furs for guns just then the told me how
 they dried meat and how they made stoneys saw a blackfoot war party coming so pemmican from dried meat fat
 and berries they threw up a low earthworks lay down chokecherriesaregoodforthis shesaid she behind it and fired the new guns
 at their enemies mentioned the sour grass that grew in our hay who fled in terror by this action they
 saved the meadow where i had often seen the women pickwhite men from the unfriendly blackfoot in ing it in
 the spring of the year very good dians she could not tell me which the white men medicine said elizabeth
 they smoked the elizabeth and judas hunter are seen here at the l azy il ranch kinnikinik not only the
 plant we call by that have often wished that i had asked more quesname but often a mixture of the
 leaves and some tions of my stoney friends but perhaps they bark she thought the best things the white man
 trusted me nd volunteer ed information because had brought were tea and tobacco for pleasure as i did not question
 them well as matches knives and guns for use elizabeth and i exchanged gifts and i treasure she said that
 the stoneys made their bows of everything she gave me she made me a club saskatoon wood very slow growing
 and hard such as the women once used to dispatch on the hills along both sides of the bow valley
 wounded enemies after a battle she said if the saskatoon bushes grew to a great size some you are riding
 and a man jumps out of the woods almost resembling small trees and measuring and grasps the bridle of your
 horse strike him over two inches in diameter that is how the here she pointed to her temple and you
 will kill bow river got its name said elizabeth him i do not doubt it among other things she made
 me a beautiful large bag using the tanned elizabeth undertook the task of teaching me hide from the shin bones
 of elk ver y rich in stoney i was very pleased for in those days most color with buckskin handles
 and buckskin stoneys did not want their neighbour s to learn their language they wished to be able to discuss
 fringe on the bottom transactions among themselves without being one january she dropped in to see me understood by others
 she strongly disapproved happy new year elizabeth i said she took of jacob swa mpy s efforts to teach me
 saying me by the hand and said god bless you and that he was just a halfbreed half stoney and
 half keep you and give you a happy new year cree she said that he was giving me some cree
 another time we were sitting quietly and siwords the following are my spellings of the lently as good friends can
 finally she said to words as they sounded to me and as i remember me we often make a white
 man chief and them long years later sometimes we make a white girl princess it after she told me the
 numbers one to ten i sang doesn t mean much but you jean should be a them to the tune
 of ‘ twinkle twinkle little star stoney queen i was so moved i couldn t wa she noom yab nee
 too soo speak elizabeth should have been the stoney sup ta sac pa sha go wee queen so dignified she
 was and so wise sha no ha num jo wik wik chim na wa she noom when the day of
 the sun dance approached yab nee too soo sup ta sac pa she invited me to the ceremony you will
 be sha go wee sha no ha the only white person there she said and she she told methe stoney
 names forourrivers all told me the location nd explained how to get ending in wapta which means river or la
 ke or there marion nicoll was staying with us on that water waptan means creek some of the names day
 and offered to drive me there in her car we she taught me were nas a be for the bow
 river had to go some distance beyond morley then we cha na he ghost river and our creek was turn
 north and bump over the cpr tracks where chaba waptan in part the spruce trees hid it and there was
 no crossing we stopped some disthe spruce tree they called chaba mus tem nin tance from the lodge which was
 built of trees and ogo was my valley and my camp was cha say branches around the sun dance tree
 from which go hin meaning place of dead or dry wood streamers of many colours blew in the wind one
 indian came to meet us he told me that i was over the years i learned the names of the
 months or moons the four points of the expected but that my friend must stay back and compass the trees
 animals weather colour s that no pictures were to be taken i went up and after some hesitation i entered
 the lodge and sat and other nouns and some verbs i learned certain phrases nd although i could not carry
 on a down cross legged as some others did no one made me feel that i was an intruder i
 stayed a conversation in stoney i could ask some ques short time watching the proceedings and then i tions and
 give some answers interestingly left i cannot say what went on in the lodge enough they gave stoney names to
 things they had never had before the white man came for when we sold the ranch i felt that i
 was example oatmeal they called ha kay and leaving behind my best friend a friend whom i breakfast was ha
 kay wa ta be meaning might never see again by this time she was very oatmeal eat it struck me
 as odd that the plural old i met her once later on in cochrane she was of weana which means
 girl was weambina i very frail and tiny and appeared to be blind two stoney girls supported and led her
 sadly i realized that she did not recognize me jacob swampy camped alone near the southwest corner of the rabbit
 lake often when i was riding through the reserve on the east side of the wide valley he would summon
 me standing above the louie spring he would give the owl call this was a traditional call among the stoneys
 who are a branch of sioux nation in 1876 the day before the battle at the little big horn the
 cr ow scouts climbed to the top of the highest hill to look for the sioux camp and seeing it
 they gave the owl call as the sioux give it soft and clear to tell custer they had found the
 camp the soft who oo oo carries far hearing it i would ride across and jacob would perhaps ask me
 if i had seen his buckskin horse jacob swampy was born about 1880 when his parents were on a hunting
 trip behind black rock mountain when i knew him he was n old man who wore the same thin braids
 and he limped because of a rigidly bent knee he could be a mean bad tempered old fellow but i
 always considered him a friend he treated his old buckskin horse very roughly practically living on its back constantly beating
 a tattoo on its ribs with his moccasined heels consta ntly swinging his quirt against its flank sometimes he also
 beat the poor horse over the head my daughter s donna and peggy hated him for this and occasionally finding
 the horse hobbled they took the hobbles off and threw them away once when he was at our ranch they
 loosened his cinch watched to see the result then ran for their lives jacob had greater compassion for the yellow
 dog which followed at the heels of his horse when he was going to morley by car one time he
 asked me to feed the dog every evening when i rode up with some scraps nd bones the faithful hound
 was lying in front of his tent almost every day jacob came to our ranch just a mile from the
 reserve sometimes when it was cold he would draw a chair up close to the stove and sit there with
 his eyes shut if he thought we had company as we often did have in the summer he would pass
 on by and go to see guy gibson when he did come i would make him a cup of tea
 and give him something to eat as a reward he taught me the stoney language some of the words that
 came to mind are come in sit down tea sugar milk bread and butter at times his guttural speech made
 it difficult for me to get the pronunciation just right then he would sound the letters phonetically ch he would
 pronounce chu which made it more confusing he also taught me a little sign language he never worked for us
 neither did he ask us to lend him money once he borrowed laurie s rifle at a time when two
 or three families were camped at rabbit lake then one of the men came down and begged laurie to take
 the rifle back before jacob shot all of them as he had threatened to do they pulled out for morley
 leaving jacob alone and he brought the rifle back when he was through with it another time he borrowed laurie
 s hunting knife when the hunting season opened i asked him to return it but he said that he didn
 t have it he next time he came i told him that laurie wanted his knife he became very angry
 mounted his horse and left without staying for his cup of tea he continued to come almost every day but
 i did not ask for the knife again neither did he bring it back about four o clock one morning
 our great dane dutton began barking furiously and between barks i hea rd the owl call i shook laurie jacob
 had borrowed it but it was still bright and and told him that jacob swampy was in trouble clean we
 dressed and went out i hurried to the opening when i went to the morley stampede a few between the
 trees and stood there above the spr ing days later the la rge colourful tepees wer e set up listening
 then from west of robinson creek i in a huge semi circle i took some eggs cookies hea rd the
 owl call again laurie hastened over the and ciga rettes to the tepee of my friends elizarough ground and through
 the willow bushes beth and judas hunter inside a little fire burned which were between us and the creek there
 he under a black pot and around it sat eight or ten saw jacob and called to him to stay
 where he was indians i passed the cigarettes around and took but hearing laurie s voice the man staggered the
 seat offered forward and fell into the water with great difficulty laurie got him out and brought him to i
 have something to tell you i said and i the house by this time i had a fire going in
 the related to them some details of my association wood stove we covered him with blankets and with jacob swampy
 his calls across the valley poured hot milk and brandy into him after he his visits the borrowed knife which
 he had failed had recovered and seemed rational laurie put to return nd his dying hope of finding our gate
 him into the pickup and drove him to the camp of then the owl call and the return of the
 knife his son in law louie wildman there was stunned silence no one moved and jacob had begun to lose
 his eyesight he had i noticed a strange look of fear in some of the old been overtaken by darkness
 on his way back from eyes i made no comment on what had happened the little store on the highway
 and had tried to take and sensing hat they wanted to talk among a shortcut behind the glenfinnan ranch he
 had themselves i said umb wa stige and left missed the gate which led into section eight left this strange
 inexplicable happening seemed his horse and tried to walk to camp however he to have had the power to engender
 others of a had become confused mistook our crossing on similar kind every once in a while jacob was robinson
 creek for the one farther north and had seen in particular n old chief going to the wandered all night
 in the rough wooded terrain spring for water rushed back in great alarm west of us saying that he had
 seen jacob swampy coming he never fully recovered from this experience on his buckskin horse the chief died shortly and
 a few months later we heard that he was ill in afterwards morley my friend elizabeth hunter brought me later
 that summer i met dan wildman in the word of him he lies on his bed in a little tent
 store he took me aside nd asked is it true she said all the time his feet go as if
 he is riding what you said about jacob swampy i anshis horse and all the time his arm swings as
 it used wered yes it is true as i spoke i looked at to do with his quirt and he
 keeps saying ‘ where this tall dignified indian who had fixed me with is laurie johnson s gate i can
 t find laurie the most piercing gaze i had every encountered i johnson s gate met his eyes steadily jacob
 swampy died and was buried in the i believe you he said wesley cemetery when june came the few indians
 who camped at rabbit lake left and went to morley to prepare noah goat was an unusual stoney indian in
 for the stampede one day donna and i were in that he neither laughed nor smiled the stoneys the kitchen
 with the back door open when are a merry people much given to jokes and startled and incredulous i heard
 the owl call i laughter but noah wore the same woeful countslowly went outside and stood above our spring enance
 whenever i saw him he spoke sadly of soft and clear i heard it again the owl call that the
 past when he had a good job as teamster jacob used to make i went back inside the house around
 the indian agency at morley a time and asked donna if she had heard anything when he courted and married
 flora one of the yes she said i heard an owl s hoot but i prettiest girls on the reserve
 now flora had a don t think it was an owl wandering eye and this caused him greater mel early
 next morning i went out to get some ancholy but itdid not lead to violence noah was kindling and there
 lay laurie s hunting knife on small and slight helpless i thought as he the path near the door six
 years had passed since recounted to me the details of this infidelity he had been abandoned when a baby a
 fact ing at rabbit lake one of them came down and that may have had an effect upon his whole
 out asked me to make them some raisin buns i had look on life a good couple had adopted him
 and one of those large old black pans so i baked it he had repaid them with affection with touch
 full of raisin buns for them another time louie ing pride he told me a simple success story asked me
 to help them with christmas celebraconcerning his adoptive parents when all the tions i was able to give them a
 box of japanese band went off on the hunt in the late summer the oranges and some packets of cigarettes
 they family had stayed at home to put up hay along the repaid me by bringing moose meat and venison
 bow valley in those days land that had not been in the summer this i canned or corned for we
 burned over by fires produced grass knee high had no refrigeration i saved all my bacon grease when the hunters
 returned the family had put up and dripping for them and let them know when many stacks and when winter
 set in with deep we were butchering they had a great time snow and bitter cold the feed was needed
 by the taking the offal stoneys for their horses his parents then traded one day noah came down to the
 ranch and hay for horses and meat and in the end they were told me about a new baby he
 did not make it better off than the hunters clear whose baby it was but i could see that he
 although noah spoke as if all the good in his was very concerned he said something life was behind him
 he did have his triumphs wrong with baby i asked him to explain her he was an excellent shot with
 the bow and arrow piss comes out her belly button he said i gave and always won the archery contests
 at morley him a can of zinc powder and told him to sprinkle he and joe fox regularly won the
 pie race at it on the baby s navel this apparently cured the sundre there the democrats were drawn up
 at trouble the starting post with two men in each wagon from then on noah had great faith in me
 as a all the men were given a piece of pie and a bottle doctor on one occasion he said
 oh mrs of pop at the word go they had to eat the pie laurie my boy jack awful sick
 drink the pop and then race around the track joe s competitiveness and noah s cheerlessness what is the matter
 with him i asked stood them in good stead as the crowd cheered oh mrs laurie i don t know
 but for three and yelled with laughter for at the word go days now he shit his head off i
 gave him a lard each of them shoved the whole wedge of pie into pail full of milk told him
 to boil it and give it to his mouth swallowed once tipped up the bottle jack i also gave him
 part of a bottle of extract of and let the pop run down his throat they were wild strawberry noah
 was not showing disresoff down the track before the others had started pect by using those basic words they were
 the on the pop and they won with ease only english words he knew to explain the prob in the
 summer noah often camped at rabbit lems lake every day at noon he would come in just one evening noah
 entertained us with ghost as we were about to sit down to the table and i stor ies he said
 that he was riding down the would always ask him to join us one day he valley north of the
 barc not long after the death appeared just as we had finished our meal and in of george creighton who
 had owned the bar c fact we had cleaned up everything on the table ranch some distance behind him he
 heard noah sat in a chair against the kitchen wall with a george yelling as he sometimes did when he
 was very long face finally he spoke alive it was getting dark and noah was terrified mrs laurie he said
 some day when he urged his horse into a gallop but the shouting you are hungry come to my tent
 and i will feed came closer and closer finally the ghostly rider you passed him still shouting he knew not
 what and the sound faded into the distance all right noah i said i will get you something i made
 a fresh pot of tea fried two jacob swampy he said was riding home one eggs and with bread and
 butter and syrup he evening when he passed the grave of a bad made a fairly good meal woman her
 ghost jumped up behind his saddle we were all hard up in those days noah once and sat there jabbering
 jacob couldn t sha ke her said to me you just have to write on a piece of off nor
 could he feel her but she stayed with him almost to his tent paper i can t do that i
 have to have money once when they were having some sort of gather noah had been telling these stories for
 some women if they knew they were being followed the frightened women said that they did but had been afraid
 to look around jacob took some wa pay tea up and put it on the grave to pacify the ghost
 and she was never seen again my husband was working at the sawmill across the valley when winter set in
 early nd was bitterly cold he used to get up at five in the morning light our fires and walk
 over to the mill to have breakfast with the other men our cattle were still up on rabbit creek one
 evening he told me to ride up there the next day and drive the red poll cow down he intended
 to butcher her and sell the meat to the mill neither of us knew that by morning the mercury would
 have dropped to 4 j below zero but in spite of the cold i bundled up and rode north on
 my good horse sailor all the indians i thought had gone south with the birds so i was very surprised
 to see a tent beside the trail and smoke coming from the stove pipe i was even more surprised when
 the head of noah goat came out through the flap mrs laurie he said are you gone crazy i told
 him my errand and although i was very cold i did not ask to enter the tent i made it
 a practice never to go into their tents only into their big tepees where they expected to entertain their friends
 the stoneys were a dignified people who appreciated being treated with a certain amount of reserve i wondered if noah
 was there alone it was unusual for him to be away from morley in the winter time perhaps he had
 fled from gossip tok ee ah flora flora goat wa stige nish pass a few stoneys who had nothing to
 do and you heard these remarks where so and so so and so no good i rode on pondering the
 fact that laurie and i for all our practice could not pitch a tent as perfectly as the stoney women
 did every line straight every plane flat ever y rectangle strictly rectangular i thought if an artist painted their tents
 as they were the effect would seem to stiff i was freezing i alternately rubbed my hands over my face
 and tucked them under the edge of my saddle blanket trying to warm them i took my feet out of
 the stirrups and held them against sailor s flank finally i reached the narrow entrance to my valley where the
 high hills closed in and in the past gave me such a feeling of comfort and content now they stood
 aloof cold silent and uncaring i found red poll managed to cut back the the author s husband laurie johnson
 is seen here with noah goat time when suddenly he realized that dusk had fallen he rn out of our
 house in alarm jumped on his horse and lit out on a gallop for his tent noah might be easily
 frightened but not jacob two young man if ever a stoney had his head on straight it was jacob we
 were at the beaupre gyn ikhana where jacob had come because his grandson was riding in the stock horse class
 while jacob was sitting on the steps of the school house he motioned to me to come and sit beside
 him i believe your story about jacob swampy he said he looked off into the distance then he added i
 have seen a ghost and he told me his stor y the stoneys were camped below castle mountain in the
 evening jacob his first wife and another woman walked up the steep slope leading to the mountain jacob wanted to
 stay there for a while where he could look down on the camp and see if all fires were out
 the two women walked back without him nd as jake was watching them he saw that just as they passed
 the gr ave of an indian woman she rose up and followed behind them when they reached the road his
 wife and her friend turned to the right and the ghost turned to the left and disappeared jacob hurried down
 the slope and asked the cows which wanted to follow and headed for my horse and keep going home i
 dismounted and walked but the snow later i came to noah s tent silence nothing only made my feet colder
 then i was too stiff to moved a thin wisp of smoke came from the get back on anyway i
 couldn t hurry the cow stove pipe i continued on home or the horse in the intense cold the years
 went by the indians were given the i was winding my way along the east side of right to buy
 liquor a nd frequent the beer the lake when i smelled willow smoke i was parlours it would take them
 some time to learn amazed for i could see no smoke and i was far how to handle these rights
 that the elders of the from noah s tent i came to a place where the tribe fought against one
 cold morning flora trail passed between high willow bushes and was found dead beside the cochrane high there in front
 of us was a great heap of glowing school noah was heartbroken we had retired embers ithankedgodandlthankednoahgoat and was living
 in calgary but i met him in i stood in the shelter of the bushes and warmed cochrane he said
 you hear about flora i myself sailorcrowded close and so did red poll said that i had and i was
 sorry they say she and i thought i could see in their eyes the wonder was drunk he said but
 i know she was not i felt my knees hands and feet were in agony drunk someone kill flora but
 after a while i was warm i was able to mount he was faithful to her to the end natural
 gas well a party consisting of f macbeth w h hogg c e watson and j j young had an
 interesting motor trip on wednesday to the natural gas well which is being bored under the direction of a w
 dingman manager of the calgar y natural gas company the works are situated at the western end of the sarcee
 indian reserve the actual distance from calgary according to the measurement of the auto metre was 13 ½ miles by
 the sprucevale trail the day was an ideal one for motoring and the roads were in good condition except in
 a few spots the extent of the boring plant was a great surprise to the visitors the huge derrick can
 be seen for miles around the plant building machiner y and everything connected with the undertaking is of the most
 subslantial character several thousand feet of immense iron tubes are on the ground the men in charge most of whom
 are experienced oil and gas well borers say that the plant is the best they have ever seen in ny
 country owing to a cave in caused by too much water the progress made with the well has not been
 as rapid as was expected the distance bored up to date being 92 ft if the obstacle referred to had
 not been encountered the hole would now have been three or four hundred feet the operation of boring is a
 most interesting one a huge steel drill somewhat on the principle of a chisel and weighing over a ton is
 suspended in the well at the end of a long cable and hauled up and allowed to fall several times
 a minute the power being furnished by a steam engine in connection with a system of immense pulleys and a
 windlass after half an hour to an hour of this pounding with the drill an immense tube arrangement with a
 valve at the bottom is lowered into the well and pulled up full of mud which is automatically dumped into
 a sluice box on wednesday the drill was pounding an unusually hard stratum of rock a variety known among builders
 as blue hardhead the impression created on the visitors was that the plant was a most substantial one and that

 a critical such a game or analytical study but nevertheless it is the point of departure for anyone interested in

 consulted tor y the role of the continental french in estab riel s writings this play does not strictly adher

 to dorge has adopted a subjective interpretation the author this story did not unfold as an invi which focuses on

 mission resulted who sought to find a new life in the west because from external forces of internal conflicts since
 they found the religious political and social the exterior world is unimportant the reader is climate in france incompatible with
