 cd jp pl message from the colonel in chief princess patricias canadian light infantry has provided sterling service for the 
 past eighty five years our history from the unique founding when andrew hamilton gault personally raised this regiment to the 
 heroic endeavors demonstrated 0:demonstrat 0:ed in world war i world war ii and the korean conflict and finally the numerous 
 operational 0:oper 0:ational un and nato missions has portrayed a regiment rich in tradition professionalism 0:profes 0:sionalism and dedicated service 
 both on the national and international scene this has been a tremendous year for me as your colonel in chief 
 i have had the splendid opportunity to visit my patricias across canada during the 85th anniversary of the founding of 
 our regiment and my 25th year as your colonel in chief it was a great pleasure for me to visit 
 association and serving members in fredericton gagetown pei ottawa kingston edmonton calgary vancouver and victoria i was most impressed with 
 the 85th anniversary trooping where all four battalions 0:bat 0:talions including the loyal edmonton regiment trooped their colours what inspired 
 all of us was the large number of the old guard who marched past at the end of the trooping 
 when i visited the ppcli museum in calgary i was very moved by the kind gift of the bronze relief 
 the peacekeepers given to me by the regiment for my 25th anniversary i am so happy that this splendid gift 
 which touched me very much can remain in the museum for all to enjoy for the years to come it 
 was most interesting to visit my patricias in the infantry school in gagetown their continued professional approach in providing excellent 
 advanced training for our nco and the important training and development of the officers in the army is well exemplified 
 in the high standards maintained in our regiment i had a marvelous opportunity to visit 1 ppcli in kosovo these 
 fine soldiers ncos and officers continued to demonstrate the proud professional standards that i have become so used to observing 
 in difficult un and nato missions 3 ppcli has had a very busy fall preparing for a un operation in 
 bosnia commencing in late february 2000 my second battalion not only continues to perform well on demanding training exercises including 
 live fire combat team and battle group ranges but provided marvelous 0:mar 0:velous support to the pan am games in 
 winnipeg as we enter a new millennium i do look forward to visiting my third then second battalions on their 
 un tours as well in june in participating in the change of command in winnipeg and witnessing the presentation of 
 new colours to the first battalion in edmonton i am confident that our patricia soldiers will continue to inspire all 
 canadians with their outstanding professional endeavours and achievements indeed our proud heritage will continue

 we celebrated 0:cele 0:brated in july the 85th anniversary of the founding of our regiment and the 25th anniversary of 
 lady patricia s appointment to be our colonel in chief the operational tempo picked up as first battalion at short 
 notice deployed to kosovo and third and second battalions intensified their preparations for deployments to bosnia in 2000 reunions are 
 about seeing old comrades and remembering fondly those who are missing there were plenty of opportunities for that in edmonton 
 there were also ceremonial occasions to celebrate our regiment s 85 years of distinguished service 0:serv 0:ice to canada and 
 particularly notable was trooping the colours of all four battalions there was also the dedication of gault park which will 
 provide a significant patricia focal point within our new home station in celebration of her 25 years as our colonel 
 in chief lady patricia s itinerary 0:itiner 0:ary took her from coast to coast where she and lord john met 
 an enormous number of her patricia s both serving and retired in calgary her visit to the patricia gallery was 
 the opportunity for the regiment to formally thank her for her dedicated service throughout the past quarter century and to 
 assure her of our continued respectful devotion 0:devo 0:tion the tangible aspect of this was our gift to her of 
 a bronze relief which will remain on display in the gallery it was a distinct pleasure for me to visit 
 the first battalion in kosovo and to observe how well the battle group was performing in that very difficult theatre 
 of operations 0:oper 0:ations the high standard of professionalism of all members was well recognized by the international community and 
 clearly respected by the local population third battalion distinguished itself by winning both the hamilton gault and skill at arms 
 trophies and through a series of challenging exercises has proven to be well prepared for its task in bosnia its 
 deployment is taking place as i write this message 0:mes 0:sage second battalion provided outstanding support to the pam am 
 games last summer 0:sum 0:mer and is now focused on its deployment to bosnia in 20001 as we enter our 
 86th year i am confident that the regiment will continue to maintain the very high standard which has been so 
 well demonstrated throughout our history well done patricias i m proud of you all

 membership it is with great concern that i watch the dwindling of membership in our associations unfortunately there are some 
 people who would not think of joining the associations and others who do not believe that it is relevant to 
 or effective for them having noted these remarks i urge that all branches take all prudent measures to ensure that 
 non member patricia s in your area be tracked down and as many of these people as possible be updated 
 on a regular basis these actions constitute a basic obligation and serve to keep the list the family alive we 
 also must begin to recruit those who are leaving the serving component in a methodical process presently a complimentary one 
 year free association membership is available to all patricians that are leaving active service i encourage all branches to ensure 
 that these retiree s are invited to the occasional get together and that we remind them of the benefits of 
 being an association member furthermore for those patricians who have not been exposed to the camaraderie in our association and 
 our branches let me assure you that the arbitrary distinctions imposed by the military caste system 0:sys 0:tem probably one 
 of the most rigid in the world are noticeably weakened when entering our environment yes we respect the past achievements 
 of all individuals but also we go forward with a sense of fellowship that has been built over years of 
 serving the regiment in a common cause you will be able to revive friendships that would never have been possible 
 in civilian 0:civil 0:ian life annual events such as the general meetings and reunions every five years for both the 
 regiment and the kapyong battle give you the opportunity to meet with your former comrade in arms

 the patrician 1998 26 the royal green jackets ist battalion the royal green jackets the battalion set about the final 
 phase of its preparations for a 2 year tour in hollywood belfast at the start of the year few would 
 have predicted that by the end of it the british government would have devolved many of its responsibilities for northern 
 ireland to an assembly in stormont even fewer would have dared to imagine that sinn fein would take up ministerial 
 responsibilities within the assembly conversely and with good reason it was widely felt that during the summer the security forces 
 might be faced with some of the worst civil unrest in recent times new security issues were emerging in the 
 event it was a benign marching season and aside from limited deployments in and outside the 39 infantry brigade area 
 the battalion has been committed to static operational 0:opera 0:tional duties in the forward area of operations in north belfast 
 and around the home base as we approach the millennium there is genuine optimism in northern ireland we shall see 
 it is self evident that establishing and maintaining an operational edge in such a complex operational environment 0:environ 0:ment sustainable 
 over an indefinite period of time has not been straightforward that the battalion has done so with good humour and 
 unerring professionalism is a source of personal satisfaction as always in a green jacket battalion soldiering in a wider sense 
 is enthusiastically and imaginatively embraced company level exercise are now in full swing and for the first time in memory 
 a resident battalion will conduct an out of province exercise next year adventure training exercises with plenty of support from 
 the regiment have been programmed 0:pro 0:grammed throughout the year sports too has taken off and of note 1 rgj 
 has been represented in army rugby hockey rowing football and cricket in 1999 we look forward to the battalion s 
 participation in the northern ireland boxing final early next year on the regimental front the battalion has had visits from 
 field marshal the lord bramall the colonels commandant regimental headquarters and within the theatre chain of command brigadier balfour 2nd 
 battalion the royal green jackets looking back to what i wrote last year it is striking how wrong one was 
 about what 1999 might bring the battalion s period of consolidation 0:consolida 0:tion lasted for 4 months before we were 
 stood up for potential high intensity 0:intensi 0:ty war fighting operations in kosovo and i write this sitting in pristina 
 
 the patrician 1999 27 where the battalion has been since september and will be until the end of march the 
 role is peacekeeping but with the emphasis on maintaining law and order encouraging a united nations international police force to 
 take the lead and protect a serb minority from albanian intimidation it is stimulating to say the least being at 
 the forefront of the campaign 0:cam 0:paign and therefore in a position to define its course is very different the 
 battalion s experience in bosnia during 1998 and this time everyone is involved in the process from rifleman upwards the 
 battalion s principal achievements so far have been the reduction of inter ethnic violence to a minimum leading to early 
 and encouraging signs of serbs beginning to return the establishment of a joint police military structure at every level reminiscent 
 of early days in west belfast which will one day lead to a withdrawal of the military from the streets 
 of pristina but perhaps the most striking aspect of 2 rgj s recent experience is that in a two and 
 half year period between november 1998 and may 2000 the battalion will have spent all its time either preparing for 
 operations 0:opera 0:tions on operations or recovering from them a parallel with green jacket deployments in the early 1970 s 
 that will not be lost on association members 0:mem 0:bers and a pattern that is likely to continue until we 
 leave germany in three year s time however given my accuracy this time last year i shall refrain from forecasting 
 in detail what the future might bring the london regiment f and g coys have now fully integrated into the 
 london regiment the process is slow but the rsm is beginning to learn more about light division drill the year 
 as always has been busy for the riflemen notably we have 13 soldiers away with 2 rgj in kosovo this 
 ranges from the rank of csm to rfn word has it that things are pretty busy in pristina and that 
 they are having a challenge royal rifle volunteers rgj the first few months following the formation of the royal rifle 
 volunteers rrv from an amalgamation of 5 rgj elements of 6 7 pwrr and 2 rgbw are now behind us 
 for those readers who are still unsure how sdr affected 5 rgj the results are as follows we have rgj 
 rifle coys in the following locations a rgj coy has 2 platoons and the waterloo band v in oxford with

 rgbw coy in reading with a platoon in swindon and c pwrr coy in portsmouth with a platoon on the 
 isle of wight the battalion will be fully operation by april 2000 atr winchester c company atr winchester continues to 
 fly the green jacket flag at winchester although the numbers for green jackets being trained at any one time rarely 
 numbers more than 45 phase 1 training is constantly being reviewed and there have been numerous rumours as to our 
 future here we are sitting tight for the moment although by next april the army foundation scheme afs company where 
 all the recruits do three weeks induction training before coming to us will probably be scrapped the recruits will do 
 one weeks induction within the company followed by twelve weeks training before moving on to catterick for the combat infantryman 
 s course this will increase the number of light division platoons in training from 3 to 4 further rumours depend 
 on the success or failure of the infantry s wish to combine all phase 1 and phase 2 training in 
 a centralized location this would almost certainly mean our departure from winchester and with the exception of regimental headquarters and 
 the museum the cutting of links with the city wastage rates continue to occupy the mind as we continue to 
 lost around 20 through voluntary release medical or unsuitable discharges sixteen year old recruits of slight build are particularly vulnerable 
 to failure moves are afoot to cut down on the number of risk entries which might help our wastage rate 
 but could mean fewer recruits reaching phase 2 itc catterick throughout 1999 the infantry training centre at catterick has continued 
 to produce soldiers ready to take their place in operational battalions 0:bat 0:talions this year the relevance of this training 
 has been underlined with trainees regularly passing out and going on to deploy to their battalions in an operational theatre 
 within a few days this has especially been the case with soldiers joining 1 rgj in belfast and 2 rgj 
 in kosovo 
 the patrician 1999 29 there has been a marked improvement in the transition from phase 1 to phase 2 training 
 using both a concerted effort to improve the passage of information to the trainees and also by trying to stem 
 some of the discharge as of right daor applications which sometimes occur early in a trainee s time at catterick 
 there are now formal week 3 and week 11 briefing for recruits these aim to dispel some of the myths 
 about catterick and provide a look forward from winchester to aid this a combined 0:com 0:bined light division weekend was 
 held at winchester in the summer which allowed all permanent staff from both locations to understand what happens 0:hap 0:pens 
 at their 2 respective locations there were a number of presentations including subjects such as phase 1 training phase 2 
 training recruiting and the requirements of the battalions themselves the day was then rounded off by a visit to the 
 town centre which was enjoyed by all many light division platoons are arriving at catterick and being trained by non 
 light division training teams to combat this the mentor system has continually been expanded upon each company has a green 
 jacket nco allocated to keep an eye on it and to be a point of contact for the trainees thus 
 providing some regimental input regimental gatherings have continued for the trainees and are held quarterly with input and appearances from 
 the rrt these provide an opportunity for the light division trainees to get together in an informal situation and see 
 what light exists at the end of the tunnel as well as allowing the permanent staff to get together

 32 the patrician 1999 vp ex patricia summit 85th anniversary ascent mt logan there are as many reasons for climbing 
 a mountain as there are climbers in the case of exercise patricia summit a ppcli initiative to scale mt logan 
 canada s highest peak our reason was simple as part of the regiment s 85th anniversary celebrations we wanted a 
 member of the regiment to stand on the top of canada in honour of those who had served before us 
 the expedition was broken down into two separate teams this was based on a plan to attack the mountain on 
 two fronts thereby increasing 0:increas 0:ing our chances of success wo greg forsyth would lead a team up the king 
 s trench route while at the same time capt wade englesby would lead a team on the classic east ridge 
 route a medical team from the us army of environmental research institute would accompany the king s trench team and 
 a medic from the calgary highlanders would join the east ridge team based on historical data it was anticipated 0:antici 
 0:pated that each route would take about 21 days to complete 0:com 0:plete east ridge capt englesby it was 0230 
 hours 21 june 1999 outside of our tent presently situated at 5200 m on mt logan s summit plateau there 
 was a clear sky the wind had ceased and it was tne deginning ot a coia aay i ne realization 
 that it was time to wakeup 0:wake 0:up and struggle out of the sleeping bag was slowly beginning to take 
 hold as expected not one of us had slept very well headaches had contributed to the lack of sleep but 
 the principle factor was that four of us had crammec ourselves into a two man tent in order to lighten 
 the team s load and save 
 the patrician 1999 33 vp precious energy as each of us began to stir i repressed the urge to utter 
 the obvious complaint that getting dressed was going to suck instead a simple grunt sufficed and as i sat up 
 i found myself staring directly at the communal relief bottle almost full hanging tenuously above my sleeping bag thankfully its 
 scent was overwhelmed by the familiar aroma of damp vapor barrier and poly pro socks across from me i could 
 see that both wo toni meier and capt matt barlee an air navigator from esquimalt who joined us last minute 
 were also stirring and beside me sgt fabio lacentra our team medic had already found his toque and was preparing 
 to exit his bag dug in next door to us approximately six feet away were the three other members of 
 the east ridge climbing team sgts pat viljanen bob timmer and bill wilson were from the us army national guard 
 mountain warfare center in vermont it was apparent that they had also begun the morning s tedious chores since meeting 
 the three of them in may bill because of his good nature had always been the target of many a 
 morning jibe this morning was proving to be no exception by 0400 hours we had broken camp and had begun 
 our march across the desolate wind swept plateau towards mt logan s east summit the americans had volunteered to take 
 the first lead and we had given them a head start of five minutes 0:min 0:utes the difficult climbing was 
 now over the only thing that stood between us and our goal was the 1 2 km trudge across the 
 plateau through drifts of thigh deep snow and then the subsequent one km scramble on a broad ridge of ice 
 snow and rock to the summit the total elevation gain would be just over 700 metres hopefully if the weather 
 held and there were no unforeseen obstacles we planned to summit and return to our high camp by no later 
 than 1800 hours travelling west it took us just shy of four hours to reach the base of a broad 
 ridge that stretched northwest up to the summit overall our movement to the base had been quick and easy not 
 easy in the physical sense quite the opposite in fact but mentally our slug forward through the 
 the patrician 1999 34 vp snow had been just that a slug the simple repetition of one foot in front 
 of the other it had not required the same level of concentration and focus as had the sharp ridge below 
 us and for this i was grateful instead we had the opportunity to marvel at the spectacular scenery and watch 
 patiently as matt fussed with his camera periodically the temperature was hovering around minus 20 celsius as i trudged past 
 pat to gain the base he commented 0:com 0:mented that he was wearing every stitch of clothing he carried but 
 was still cold this was one of the effects of climbing at high altitude your blood carrying oxygen to the 
 extremities begins to dwindle as your body tells itself to divert more oxygen to the vital organs in its core 
 hence its harder to keep your hands and feet warm and the threat of frostbite is increased the final ridge 
 provided little challenge in terms of technical work as we continued to push upwards however it became a lot more 
 difficult to summit day east ridge team wo meier sgt lacentra capt barlee sgt timmer sgt wilson sgt viljanen capt 
 englesby maintain any sort of momentum everyone was exhausted and we had been forced to increase the frequency of our 
 rest stops just shy of the summit the wind commenced and a blanket of clouds began to settle around us 
 i stopped for a moment to once again admire the stunning scenery of canada s st elias mountain range and 
 the distant pacific ocean as it slowly disappeared into the surrounding mist so much for a clear summit day i 
 thought at 12 21 hours amidst howling wind and blowing snow all seven of us were standing together on the 
 mountain s sum 
 the patrician 1999 35 vp mit oblivious to the conditions and drunk on euphoria we shared our moment of triumph 
 on the roof of canada with spirited shouts of pride and great grins of pure satisfaction this was the climax 
 of a 14 day 0:14 0:day ascent and we took the time to relish it knowing full well that the 
 hardest part of the climb may just be about to begin twenty minutes later after the shouting was over and 
 the obligatory photographs had been taken we reluctantly started the descent through the clouds and out of the wind we 
 reached our high camp back on the plateau at 1637 hours the round trip from camp to the summit had 
 taken us a total of 12 hours the majority of that time had been spent plowing through snowdrifts on the 
 plateau as a team we were then faced with an important decision do we pack up and continue our descent 
 or do we try and get some rest considerina our condition i wanted to sit tiaht and rest for a 
 few hours not everyone agreed with my suggestion 0:sug 0:gestion however and the idea had to be debated there were 
 several good reasons for going mmediately our most recent forecast said that a large unstable 0:unsta 0:ble low pressure system 
 was sitting just off of the pacific coast it also indicated that the system would hit us within the next 
 24 36 hours we had gambled 0:gam 0:bled that we could make the summit and get off the plateau by 
 then the weather however had been deteriorating since noon and the storm was probably going to arrive sooner than expected 
 therefore it would be wiser to get off the open plateau before being stranded indefinitely 0:indefinite 0:ly in a cramped 
 tent and with only 5 6 days of food and fuel left if rationed carefully my argument to stay was 
 based on historical facts history had proven that a far greater number of climbers are injured or killed while descending 
 a mountain this is because climbers like everyone else tend to make more mistakes when they are tired cranky and 
 worst of all impatient 0:impa 0:tient if the storm was going to hit in a few hours i reasoned that 
 we would starting the descent from the summit plateau 22 06 99

 be we were all more than a little surprised when at 0500 hours on the 22 june we awoke to 
 clear skies and calm winds not ones to overlook a stroke of good fortune we were on our way in 
 less than an hour the next 36 hours were a blur we only stopped to recover caches of food and 
 fuel pick up garbage and eat in total we had to clear five camps not including the high camp on 
 the plateau and our base camp on the glacier all the camps had large be in a far better position 
 to deal with it if we remained in our present camp given our present physical condition why risk getting caught 
 in a storm and being forced to dig a new camp or snow cave elsewhere a compromise was reached and 
 we all agreed to stay and rest until at least 2200 hours if the weather held or improved we would 
 make a run for the lower ridge if it didn t we would prepare ourselves for a long wait at 
 2200 hours there was no requirement to look outside and observe the weather the only decision to be made was 
 who had to get dressed in order to dig out sfc wilson descending exposed ridge to camp 2 
 the patrician 1999 37 vp caches so by the time we reached our last camp each of us resembled a 
 vagabond our rucksacks were enormous and laden with pickets ropes fuel containers and bags of burnt garbage the most difficult 
 portion of our descent proved to be from the top of the coulior that we had used to climb up 
 and gain the ridge to the large bergschrund at the base of the glacier the majority of the snow in 
 the coulior was crap almost isothermic and in danger of avalanching in order to get to our rappel point everyone 
 was forced to belly crawl over the last 50m patch of snow four hours later we were all relieved to 
 be standing at the base of the coulior safely out of range of falling rock and anxiously preparing our skis 
 and toboggans for the last push to base camp shortly thereafter at 1700 hours on the 23rd of june we 
 were all sitting comfortably at our base camp thankful for bigger tents clean underwear and incoming choppers the king s

 storm this time exposed to even higher winds despite the weather the morale is high everyone is looking forward to 
 a long day and a shot at the summit tomorrow camp 4 lies on the large summit plateau of mount

 in a white out in such a vast featureless area hopes are high as we crawl into our sleeping bags 
 for the night we awake in the semi darkness 0:dark 0:ness of the arctic summer night what is the problem 
 why are we feeling so claustrophobic mr murphy strikes again the wind has changed direction 0:direc 0:tion slightly and snow 
 has begun to drift into the tent site over the snow walls and has begun to pile against the tent 
 collapsing the walls in on the occupants this begins a ritual that will continue for the next two and a 
 half days every couple of hours day and night someone has to get dressed and go out to shovel off 
 the tents so that they do not collapse and poles are not bent or broken this could be disastrous and 
 mean a hasty retreat down

 to bring a deck of cards and a cribbage board and sanity is maintained by games of euchre and cribbage 
 discussion revolves around summit hopes and the weather it is decided that with the first reasonable break in the weather 
 we will go for the summit regardless of the time there is enough light to climb at 0200hrs it s 
 1000 hrs 20 june 1999 and a peek out the tent door reveals very cold and windy weather but clear 
 bright skies a quick o group is called and it is decided that we will brew up prepare and leave 
 at 1230hrs skis on packs on ready to go we all stare longingly at the summit which looks remarkably close 
 a few hours of skiing and the summit seemingly getting no closer quickly sorts out the misconception that we will 
 tag the top and be back in the tent in just a few hours we are in for a bit 
 of a haul members of the team take their turn in the lead breaking trail as we plough through the 
 two feet of new snow that has fallen during the recent storm the trail breaking is tiring everyone is short 
 of breath because of the effort 
 the patrician 1999 39 vp at 18 000 ft the wind is bitter and incessant but we are making progress 
 soon the slope becomes too steep and icy and we must cache our skis we traverse out onto the face 
 of the summit pyramid and shoot directly up towards the summit ridge cpl mark salesse leads the team up through 
 a tricky section on the ridge the snow is not very good fatigue fades as we begin to taste the 
 excitement of the approaching summit and finally at 2030hrs we find ourselves standing on top congratulations are offered all around 
 the views are spectacular the sky is a deep blue and the sun is dropping on the horizon some wispy 
 clouds fill the valleys far below as we gaze at the panorama of the most majestic peaks that the st 
 elias range has to offer our journey is only half over now the descent the descent is a critical time 
 when the climber really feels the fatigue as the euphoria of the summit wears off ours is thankfully uneventful we 
 arrive back at camp 4 at 0130hrs and after a quick brew we collapse into our tents extremely cold and 
 very tired the next day dawns clear and very cold and windy we break camp and make a dash for 
 camp 2 with warmer temps and lower altitudes some teams can make the trip back to base in a day

 that the unit was selected for roto 6 in bosnia with such a roller coaster and engrossing year the millennium

 utilizing obstacles to a jungle lane to a sniper stalk to pairs fire and movement to group fire and movement 
 and culminating in section live fire attacks the second exercise was similar and was capped off with a live fire 
 platoon sized woods clearing range in the middle of all this excitement a section of eddies boarded a twin otter 
 plane at the air strip and flew to the northwest territories for a search and rescue exercise with 440 squadron

 were flying soldiers were daging and contingency operation plans were circulating 0:circu 0:lating in preparation for watc s contribution to 
 the land force western area task force as we all learned at the stroke of midnight actually earlier than that 
 for all the people watching the festivities around the world the deployment 0:deploy 0:ment did not occur the process however 
 was not an exercise in futility a great number of lessons were learned concerning the preparation of contingency operations plans 
 in the past we have had to react to disasters 0:disas 0:ters or emergencies after the fact i e the 
 winnipeg flood of 97 this gave us an opportunity to review the procedures we use to prepare for expected operations 
 the year came to a close on an unusual note considering our preparations for op abacus the christmas leave period 
 began a little earlier 0:ear 0:lier than usual in order to ensure that all personnel could take sufficient leave yet

 trained over 1100 candidates on courses ranging 0:rang 0:ing from basic infantry officer training to the advanced small arms course 
 to the advanced courses in mortars pioneers recce and anti armour among many others undoubtedly the regimental highlight of the 
 year was the visit of lady patricia and lord brabourne in june while she was on her crosscountry 0:cross 0:country 
 tour prior to the 85th anniversary celebration in edmonton lady patricia was able to tour the infantry school and the 
 training area and dropped in on some troops in training out in the lawfield corridor we had a very enjoyable 
 meet and greet with lady patricia at the senior nco s mess for all ranks and association members the lieutenant 
 governor of the province marilyn trenholm counsell hosted lady patricia and lord brabourne while they stayed in fredericton in suitable 
 splendor at the newly renovated old government house we were certainly fortunate to have lady patricia visit here as her 
 coming to new brunswick is quite rare indeed this was only her second visit the summer officer training season was 
 a great success some would say the most successful in recent memory a large part of the reason 0:rea 0:son 
 for this success was the efforts of the soldiers from 2 ppcli who sent an entire company to support the 
 training with instructors drivers demo troops and enemy force this was a new concept having one unit fill most of 
 these positions in past years these spots were filled with a hodge podge of soldiers from all units and many 
 from militia units from across the country the skill and professionalism that the officers and men from 2 ppcli demonstrated 
 impressed the candidates and was welcome by the permanent staff of the infantry school 1999 also saw the retirement of 
 two well known and long serving members of the regiment wo john plantz has left the country to settle in 
 stockholm sweden with his wife and new son he said that there was an open invitation for anyone to crash 
 at his place if you are in the area apparently he is the only plantz in sweden wo grant treger

 area as we embark on yet another year here in the national capital 0:capi 0:tal it is appropriate to reflect 
 back on last year s activities and the memories they bring back first of all we have been incredibly inspired 
 by the performance of our soldiers out on the front line for many service here in ottawa is a frustrating 
 0:frus 0:trating experience in the sense that many would rather be soldiering right alongside you in the battalions on the 
 other hand we recognize once we have been in the breech here for a while the tremendous work done in 
 ottawa on behalf of our soldiers that s our story and we re stickin to it it would be a 
 challenge indeed to attempt to convey to our front line comrades the depth and breadth of all our work put 
 into enhancing the soldiers lives in the units today from quality of life initiatives to capital procurement the ottawa area 
 patricias are doing their share believe it or not for many here in ottawa the saying is the one great 
 thing about fridays is that there are only two more working days to monday the hard work notwithstanding many of 
 us are itchin to be back on the front line with you the soldiers the highlight of our year last 
 year was of course the visit of our colonel in chief and lord brabourne as they passed through ottawa on 
 their way out to edmonton to celebrate our 85th anniversary she was joined by our colonel of the regiment and 
 his wife norah with only two and a half days with us her timetable was supercharged to say the least 
 if there was one specific event that meant the most to her and her fellow patricias it would have had 
 to have been the dinner hosted by the association the event was special in that it permitted the greatest number 
 of her regimental family to spend some time with her when the colonel in chief spoke to us at the 
 gathering she remarked that it was refreshing to see so many familiar faces many of whom had the honour of 
 serving as her adc over the years perhaps the highlight of her evening was the opportunity to see many of 
 her burma star veterans attending as well her entire visit was a tremendous success largely due to the outstanding hospitality 
 of the british high commissioner and his wife lady goodenough the second most significant event for the regimental community here 
 is our annual remembrance day gathering at the ppcli cairn at lansdowne park it was here that the regiment first 
 paraded way back in 1914 this is consistently the best opportunity to meet old comrades and receive a regimental update 
 from both the colonel of the regiment and our senior serving patricia in ottawa presently colonel kenward we are not 
 
 106 the patrician 1999 vp permitted to receive his update until we have all gone down and given him fifty 
 of our best push ups during these updates we are apprised of the sterling 0:ster 0:ling performance of our soldiers 
 as well as the summer s change of command 0:com 0:mand appointments if there is an event that comes a 
 close third it is the fall merit board gathering which brings cos and rsms in to disneyland on the rideau 
 what better time to pick your target and ask for that posting back to the battalion the informal gathering during 
 a break in their deliberations provided 0:pro 0:vided all the opportunity to renew regimental friendships and share of few old 
 war stories other than that there isn t too much else to offer from your ottawa brethren we wish you 
 all the best in the year ahead and remember if that career manager taps you on the shoulder and says

 the patrician 1999 125 vp 1 kingston branch the big story for the kingston branch of the association for 1999 
 is its existence although kingston historically has been associated with the artillery and latterly with signals expanded programmes at rmc 
 the army staff college headquarters 1 canadian division and components of the land staff have inevitably led to a larger 
 regimental presence although the majority are officers there are many ncos as well including many who have remustered to other 
 military occupations or who have served in battalion 0:battal 0:ion signals platoons besides the kingston area is an attractive place 
 to retire or start a second career accordingly after discussion over a period of time a founding meeting was convened 
 in december 1998 appropriately over brunch in a pub to formally launch the creation of a kingston branch by early 
 in 1999 enough serving and retired patricias had been enrolled to allow us to formally 0:for 0:mally apply for a 
 charter as a branch of the association the occasion of the colonel in chief s visit in june enroute from 
 ottawa to the regimental reunion at edmonton provided the opportunity for the formal inauguration of the branch on 30 june 
 lady patricia lord john and major general and mrs hewson were joined by some serving and retired members and ladies 
 for lunch and a tour of historic fort henry however the main event was a fine buffet held on the 
 harbour patio of the fort frontenac officers mess the same evening lady patricia presented the official branch charter to major 
 lou grimshaw ret the branch president before a good crowd of serving and retired patricias the occasion 0:occa 0:sion on 
 a perfect early summer evening provided the opportunity for members 0:mem 0:bers of the regimental family some from toronto and 
 borden to get together meet the colonel in chief and colonel of the regiment renew old friendships and tell the 
 inevitable exaggerated stories as lady patricia noted the kingston branch is a great asset for the whole regiment including veterans 
 and families which is so important we are here to serve and support members and their families and to maintain 
 0:main 0:tain those treasured regimental linkages

 132 the patrician 1999 fraser valley branch mcl canfield nineteen ninety nine started out as a potentially significant year for 
 our branch the item uppermost on most members minds was the forthcoming 0:forth 0:coming 85th reunion at the new base 
 outside edmonton at our 17 march gathering the 85th reunion was a popular topic for conversation the 17th festivities went 
 very well our ladies with a little 0:lit 0:tle seed money and a lot of individual effort put on a 
 good spread we even had some visitors join us from the victoria branch whom we tried our best to make 
 welcome later in march felix carriere our senior pilot he will be 79 on 6 dec along with a friend 
 had just completed assembling testing and getting 0:get 0:ting certified as air worthy a murphy rebel airplane kit on the 
 22nd felix figured flying conditions were near perfect and their plane was properly 0:proper 0:ly certified so it was time 
 for an inaugural recreational flight he took off from chilliwack airport and headed south a few minutes out flying at 
 1200 ft his engine went bang and quit question what is the first ia on airplane flying ok engine stops 
 for those that don t know it s put the nose down to maintain airspeed 0:air 0:speed then find a 
 place to land real quick felix managed to do this between two barbed wire fences yet with some exemplary skill 
 in the very brief time this process allowed when felix told me this story i insisted he write it up 
 he presented 0:present 0:ed it at our next branch meeting his dry quirky delivery as he read his story brought 
 a mixture of shock and hilarity to the assembled crowd because everything turned out ok we were all thrilled as 
 we enjoyed his experience vicariously the plane was recovered and ultimately repaired the 85th reunion was a wonderful experience there 
 were a few glitches of course but most of the main events went off beautifully the trooping was the highlight 
 for me the event was not just significant but historic for the first time in the history of the regiment 
 all four battalions provided a guard complete with their colours for the parade the troops as always did magnificently in 
 spite of some looming and threatening weather moving in we all got off the parade square including the old guard 
 just as the rain struck patricia luck again 
 the patrician 1998 133 vp after such a momentous summer the fall led us back into routine again until december 
 at our regular meeting on 1 dec felix reminded us of his up coming 79th birthday on the 6th the 
 members present serenaded 0:serenad 0:ed him with a rousing chorus of happy birthday to you he was admitted to hospital 
 on the morning of the 7th with a sore gut that wouldn t accept any food and was developing an
