 blackfoot as the first time they were hard up no seven in 1877 they understood that they for food they
 suffered greatly over that were to live at peace that the queen would be winter and spring and they ate
 anything they their mother and that they would be given food could find when indian commissioner edgar the government s
 understanding was that the dewdney arrived at blackfoot crossing in july indians would settle on their reserves and learn with
 some supplies he found about 1 300 in to feed themselves to the whites the treaty was a very destitute
 condition and many on the verge a business deal to the indians it was a gathering of starvation 2 he
 was afraid the indians where the great mother promised to look after would have to be fed all winter but
 word of bufher children almost like an adoption just as falo came in the autumn and the indians were a
 chief was sometimes called father of many encouraged to follow the herds into montana children his followers being his children
 leaving only the old and ill to be fed and settled so was the queen seen as someone who would
 on the reserve norman 1 macleod older look after her indian subjects brother of the mounted police commissioner a year
 later at the 1878 treaty payments chief became the indian agent for treaty seven while crowfoot of the blackfoot complained
 about a farm instructor and a rations issuer were stareceiving 5 00 per head instead of the 12 00 tioned
 on the reserve at blackfoot crossing bonus given at the treaty signing the chief probably already was beginning to realize
 that 5 00 valerie jobson grew up on a farm north of calgary would not go too far when the
 buffalo were gone she received a b sc from the university of calgary and it was clear to everyone that

 traders soon stripped found the indians nearly ready to kill all the them of horses hides and meat crowfoot con
 nearby cattle and head south he listened to their sidered returning to canada in the fall of 1880 complaints set
 a good man to issue rations but dewdney sent word to stay with the herds included the offal with their
 rations and sug after another hard winter in montana the black gested that the allotment of beef be increased and
 foot walked back to canada with little food and the flour cut gradually the turmoil simmered few horses down that
 year the blackloot harvested 100 000 on july 20 1881 crowfoot arrived at fort pounds of potatoes so it was
 possible to reduce macleod with 1 064 followers a ll destitute after flour rations 5 in the summer inspector w

 obliged to settle on its reserve the their services he suggested that they be gradu indians had rations but little
 else and they had ally told that they owed to the government oblito replace their worn out tepees with tents
 made gations for their daily food 6 the indians were of cotton sacks that winter grateful but believed it was
 the government s with the disappearance of the buffalo the duty to feed them overriding concern of the government in
 adminis more problems occurred when the government tering the treaty was economy the indians must tried to issue bacon instead
 of beef in july of become self supporting as soon as possible so the 1884 crowfoot and other chiefs complained
 to cost of rations could be reduced the blackfoot s the commissioner that they were being given main concern was
 rations they had seen what bacon on a regular basis when they had said they the loss of their steady
 food supply had done to would accept it only in the spring they finally them thus began a forty year
 struggle between agreed to take it once a week but asked that their government attempts to curtail rationing and flour
 ration not be cut down then dewdney indian efforts to have it continued improved and invited the chiefs to visit
 regina and winnipeg increased and on his return cmwfoot learned that the flour the blackfoot camps were unsettled that first
 ration had been reduced when he protested winter of 1881 82 in december indian agent inspector wadsworth conceded that the
 amount macleod reported that beef supplies had run short did look small but believed that crowfoot was at blackfoot cr
 ossing for he second time and that simply showing off the indians had threatened to shoot the farm in the
 spring of 1885 with the outbreak of the instructor the shortage of beef made the black riel rebellion some white
 settlers expected a foot nervous and suspicious they feared that the general indian uprising cecil denny was once rations would
 be cut off completely and they more put in charge of treaty seven and his first would be left to
 starve they had been told in action was to increase the blackfoot rations this 1879 that rations would be a
 temporary measure helped to keep the blackfoot peaceful as did much of the suspicion was directed against the father lacombe
 visits with government gifts men who issued the rations rough men who of tea and tobacco after the rebellion ended
 dislike indians and are not very choice in the denny noted that many promises were made language they use to
 them 3 for example to the indians which were as usual broken in regulations permitted the contractors to keep the
 after years within a year the rations were offal and heads of any animals slaughtered for cut again rations these
 were sold privately to individual meanwhile the government still tried to pro indians on one occasion when a blackfoot duce
 self supporting indians over the next few minor chief bull elk felt he was being cheated years more blackfoot gradually
 learned to farm he fired several shots at the ration house this but despite the indian agent s reports of
 improveresulted in confrontations between the blackfoot ment few became self supporting this was and the police and bull elk being
 taken to fort partly due to the giving away evil 8 the macleod for trial custom of one man sharing
 his gains with all his to ease the situation commissioner dewdney friends and relatives asked ex policeman cecil denny to
 take change when the church of england missionary informing him by telegram that it was reported arrived at the reserve
 in 1883 he found the blackfoot behaving badly alleged cause insuffi indians almost starving some children had eaten 14 poisonous
 wild parsnip and the blackfoot blamed during the early reserve years the indians the government for not providing enough food
 lived in overcrowded stuffy little shacks agents to add to the problem no one had shown the might report good
 health in the summer when indians how to cook with flour and the results many lived out in tepees but
 the government often made a meagre diet even worse there is could not deny that the death rate far outran
 the no evidence to suggest that these conditions birth rate the blackfoot population dwindled changed much during the next several
 years from 2 255 in 1882 to 726 by 1917 much of during this time the blackfoot were learning this
 was due to tuberculosis although other of several ways to make money they worked diseases also took their toll attempts
 were made for nearby ranchers during harvest and haying to teach the people about sanitation ventilation began digging and hauling
 coal in 1889 raised and vaccination but officials never seemed to and sold horses raised some crops and hay and
 have considered increasing rations to improve did general work such as digging the irrigation health conditions ditch which passed through
 their reserve when conditions obviously were still bad in 1904 the crops were blighted by the weather it was when
 a neighbour living near the reserve rememdecided that the blackfoot should raise cattle the bered blackfoot activities during a blackleg
 department of indian affairs offered to trade epidemic the indians would cut the throat of cattle for indian cayuses in
 order to get the a diseased calf cut off and bum the diseased porprogram underway however crowfoot was tions and
 then eat the rest the next year when strongly opposed to the scheme fearing that it a large prairie fire
 killed a number of cattle off would result in rations being cut off and the the reserve the blackfoot came
 with travois and blackfoot being sent north into the bush after carted away at least sixty charred remains an his
 death resistance to cattle was still strong but observer commented that for once they had in 1894 twenty ponies were
 traded initially this enough meat for the winter caused much bitterness and division within the from the first it was
 evident that the control tribe but as the first cattlemen prospered others of rations provided leverage for the authorities followed

 the new agent if years later the government attitude was the same rations could be reduced he replied that the
 when blackfoot agent j a markie deprived three blackfoot were suspicious that this would happen families of rations for several
 weeks to force them but they had been assured that the department to give up their polygamous marriages would keep
 faith on the principle that indians should work for two years later the agent put the question of their rations
 markie started a work or starve suspending rations to a meeting of the blackfoot program in 1901 and within two
 years he had cut the result was a protest letter signed by head rations down from twice to once a
 week with chiefs iron shield and yellow horse and witmore food being given to weaker and aged nessed by sympathetic
 anglican and catholic people however he complained that when old missionaries in effect it said that if the land or
 infirm people got their rations they fed all their payments were behind it was the government s able bodied relatives
 and so they never had problem not theirs the agent reported that enough for themselves marlde also instituted a the
 blackfoot insisted they had surrendered the program whereby a blackfoot could bank a land because of the r ations promised
 not only steer of his own for credit and draw out fifteen for themselves but for succeeding generapounds of meat
 per week as long as his credit tions they had been assured of the rations lasted by inspector markle by
 the agent and his staff in august of 1908 markle reported that the by the missionaries and mounted police and
 by blackfoot were thinking about surrendering part other officials with some desperation the agent of their reserve so that the
 money could be used urged that rations be continued or the blackfoot to provide a perpetual ration of seven pounds
 would never again believe anything they were each of flour and beef per person per week when told he mentioned
 that better rations had the department objected to the idea of perpetual resulted in better health rations markle observed that
 it was the only when the department pointed out that the govreason they were considering a land surrender at ernment
 had no obligation to maintain these maxall as minor chief weasel calf put it govern imum rations on their present
 extravagant ment rations were nearly nothing and as the basis 6 the frank reply from markie was that if whites
 were grazing on the south reserve anyway that had been explained to the blackfoot they the indians might as well
 get rations out of it would never have surrendered the land at all two head chiefs iron shield and running
 finally the government accepted the agent s rabbit were opposed to the surrender but compromise of reducing the rations to
 five markle noted both were on the infirm list for free pounds of beef and five pounds of flour per
 week rations as were one fifth of the tribe the only and a half pound of tea per month 7
 the head chief to support the surrender was yellow blackfoot had won that round with only slight horse general opinions
 were mixed some felt losses that the government had deliberately cut the the remaining surrendered land was sold in rations
 in order to make them give up the land another public auction on june 6 1917 with the while others
 supported the proposal finally on 55 367 acres bringing in 1 278 087 now june 15 1910 a plebiscite was
 held and the everyone was happy the government could blackfoot voted 69 to 64 in favour of surrender spend blackfoot
 money instead of its own and ing 115 000 acres leaving 185 800 acres in the the indians believed they
 had their rations in reserve part of the money from the sale was to perpetuity after many hungry years they
 had be used to build and furnish new houses for finally escaped the threat of starvation the goveveryone and to
 provide maximum rations of ernment had not kept its promise to look after seven pounds of beef five pounds of
 flour both the indians so they would now do it themselves weekly and one pound of tea per month 2
 in fact the blackfoot was one of the last reserves in canada to maintain a system of rations or a
 year later 60 771 acres of land were sold weekly food payments using its own band funds at a public
 auction but brought in only 941 872 not until after world war two when the money instead of the expected
 1 600 000 as a ran out was rationing on the blackfoot reserve result the department had to delay fulfilling

 bridge on piles in north glouchestershire had two sons who emigrated to unfortunately the young man erred as part of
 the west godfrey and my father harold my grandfather the river had quicksand and therefore it was not also coached
 youths for entrance examinations to the university or the army and among them was terence m keone who possible to
 drive down firm piles when this was became a close friend of the family he moved to canada reported to
 m keone he made a hurried trip over before the others his sister eva who became my mother and saw
 that the only solution was to build a more came to canada in 1910 just after she had married harold

 south american state would get a superior minster and jasper areas it is drawn from letters i have col type

 life done just within the time limit however the in canada local government claimed that a differ ent type of
 bridge constituted a breach of contract with terence henry m keone was born in london the result that they seized
 the whole railway within july 1883 as a boy he was sunny tempered out proper payment they then completed the

 rather narrow house atmosphere of an english country rectory as however he had to leave uppingham before there were no

 terence arrived home at brimpton in 1902 4 ragged as a scarecrow and still covered with veldt sores and very
 emaciated his little dog biddy whom he hadn t seen for two years nearly went hysterical with delight when she
 heard his footsteps and thus warned the farnily that he had arrived dad he said give me a bath and
 burn all my clothes then let me sleep r a few months after he returned he was walking down regent

 younger brother godfrey in 1902 the reverend isaac barr came over who was an extremely clever youngster with a to
 england saying that there were vast tracts of shar p tongue a bit of an introvert and intensely land for
 sale in canada for the sum of 10 for brave every 160 acres certain conditions had to be kept in
 the early part of 1900 when terence was before the land became freehold property of the only sixteen and a
 half years old he ran away settler after three years the man had to build from school before the new
 term started and his house dig a well put up a stable and fence joined up as a private with
 baden powell s the land all before the long winter set in with troops they shortly went to south africa
 sixty to seventy degrees of frost he then had to terence taking his own horse with him a get a
 certain proportion of land under cultivation thoroughbred which an uncle had given him as barr said that it would be
 to the advantage of a colt and which he had broken in himself in settlers if he could charter a
 boat from england fact while in south africa he spent much of his to canada and thus get cheaper fares
 for everytime breaking in horses for the troops many an one he would then charter a train from the port
 officer cast a longing eye at young m keone s to as far west as the railway went then buy
 all mount but he had taught it to buck at a certain tents bullocks carts horses feed and all necessign
 which unseated all those who mounted it with sary equiprnent in bulk and therefore cheaply the intention of commandeering it
 for their own they would then travel only a short distance just before the end of the boer war terence
 northwards to where they could all settle to form caught fever and dysentary he was very ill and barr s
 colony given up for dead but somehow life flickered he duly chartered the s s manitoba to sail on and
 he finally recovered he gave his horse from liverpool in february 1903 with 1 800 to a young chap who
 decided to settle in south passengers or thereabouts people of all classes africa the latter had been looking after the
 horse jumped at the opportunity younger sons of titled while terence was ill most of the troop ships folk gentry
 artisans clerks ex soldiers of whom 19 bishop lloyd third left is seen here with barr colonists at the beginning
 of their trek from saskatoon in 1903 many were cockneys all sailed among them away fortunately a canadian parson archwas
 young terence m keone and some youths deacon george exton lloyd took charge of the named ard who were the
 sons of a clergyman party before becoming a cleric lloyd had been terence s great friend harold edwards saw them
 a trooper in the 1885 riel rebellion he guided embark the would be settlers along their route and many settlers
 gave barr their money in encouraged them all along the way tables advance to pay for their equipment when the
 pianos chests of drawers etc lovingly brought immigrants arrived at the end of the railway they from england had to
 be abandoned on the side expected to find him awaiting with their supplies of the track it was springtime and
 the prairie ruts instead when barr found that all the land near became deep and muddy so that the wagons
 the railway was already occupied he deserted needed lighter loads little english children them nothing had been ordered and he
 bolted dressed very often in the white socks and thin with the money for the united states shoes of an
 english suburbia trudged along terry had not parted with the 100 his family beside the wagons and carts towards the
 promised had given him but had worn it in his belt during land eventually after days of travelling they the
 voyage on arrival he bought a horse but arrived where there were no other settlers and the rest of his
 money apart from a small amount thus were given their land some of it purchased for his own survival was
 spent in helping equip with m keone s money although they had heir those men who had women and children
 with land they had to build their shacks as fast as them some of them were so green that they
 possible and roof them with turf before the winter would have bought bullocks as milking cows archdeacon lloyd and his
 wife stayed with the they nearly all had to learn how to harness the community all that winter and put
 up a big tent horses or yoke oxen to pull the wagons then where services and concerts were held and
 so the great trek up north began to where there was instead of barr s colony the town of lloydstill
 land available two hundred miles or more minster began at first it was just called the 20 colony and the
 settlers were scattered in their a few days ago going in with our neighbours so only sutton quarter sections for
 miles around and i remain sutton is off to work on his shack with which m keone had no ready
 cash now so he earned i have been helping him but had to stay in bed today owing to my
 tiresome inside it getting very painful in the night and his meals by doing odd jobs for others he als
 9 my finally being sick so i kept in bed until 11 and then got made quite a bit of
 money by acting the corn up i still feel rather upset so i am going to occupy myself plete green
 englishman when he met up with any with making a new batch of break we are having very har d
 old canadians in his best public school voice frosts it froze our drinking water over an inch thick and where
 i broke it at twelve o clock it had frozen a quarter of he would say that he thought he
 could ride a bit an inch by four o clock right down in a deep ravine of trees that he
 had ridden in rotten row london during the week i have been helping a friend to build his don t
 you know and was considered to have shack which is now seven logs high nearly as high as he quite
 a good seat all this was quite true but the is about 5 foot something it took us two afternoons
 to do it and we came to the end of the logs which are so far hauled way that he
 said it made the canadians rise to his shack is 10 x 8 ft inside sutton s is 12 x
 12 and is the bait now five logs high his logs are much bigger and heavier i bet you can
 t ride that horse over there than tom s and require a lot of manoeuv ring some of them looking
 at the creature my uncle would say being too heavy for us to life so we have to lay other
 logs ah well it seems docile enough i think i could down roll the big one along them up to
 the building and then get one end up at a time it is pretty hard work and the chopmanage it
 eh what ping with a small hatchet to smooth off the knots and make a ring of spectators would then
 bet heavily that the logs lie evenly make my hands ache to distraction he could not daring him to raise
 his stakes when the way the corners are joined is by what is called saddling he hesitated and hoping to
 fleece him after the first two logs are put parallel to form the sides of the building and their ends
 are shaped with a nitch the next log is nicked expected toss from the bronco my uncle would also so
 as to fit the first one at right angles this one in turn allow himself to be persuaded to take
 them on is saddled above its niche for the next log to fit into only then he would stroll over
 to the corral slide off in this case the next niche is fixed at right angles to the fist the
 bar into the saddle and ride as he did when one the doors and windows are sawn out when the
 four walls he broke in the horses for the army during the are completed on saturday night sutton and i
 were on our way home from boer war his shack about 1 ½ miles from here when we passed a
 tent finally that source of income dried up as he with some new settlers in it four in number they
 came became too well known he then had to find here some weeks ago in search of land and now
 have taken other ways of earning money during the three sections close amund here one adjoins our section they very
 years while he was ploughing his land fencing kindly asked us in for supper so we went in and had
 a very pleasant evening and a better meal than we have had for many it and waiting for it to
 pay a day there is an oldish man his son and two other young all this time young godfrey edwards
 was fellows the old man comes from paisley and talks broad growing up in england he was three years seats
 he and the others have been living for many years younger than his friend terence m keone about 30 in
 new jersey in the states he says when he came over it took six weeks in a sailing vessel godfrey
 had been educated at home by his father when i got to the word came i heard a fearful squawking
 and so he had a fine classical education but no and shrieking amongst the fowls so went and found a
 large french a fair knowledge of mathematics and hawk was pursuing them one rushed into the shack the other a
 dabbling of science he wanted to become an scuttled into the bushes by the stable but the hawk went after
 another i found him in the act of killing one poor wretch engineer but his father had no money to
 send him but managed to frighten him off while the poor creature made to university at the tender age of
 seventeen he his escape minus a lot of feathers i fetched the gun and killed was sent out to canada
 to join terence and to the hawk which was still sitting on the bushes on the watch save enough money
 so that in a few years time it is the first time i have ever fired a shot gun it
 is such a he could go to mcgill university magnificent bird i wish i could have it stuffed its wings
 are over 40 inches across from tip to tip and from its beak the following are three letters from this
 boy to the end of its tail 20 inches it has a white breast with streaks who went straight from
 a middle class atmos in a vertical direction and a long black barred tail phere of an english country rectory
 to the north november 13 th have been helping sutton to build his shack west territory the first was written
 from which is now seven logs high we shall not be able to do terence s homestead near the future
 site of ver any mor e to it until the boys come back with the hor ses to haul fresh
 logs my inside is better but we are all suffering milion it was addressed to his mother and dated from
 indigestion i think the winter has really come to stay lloydminster november 10 1903 now last sunday no less than
 eight people visited us some on their way from the colony to edmonton and some from i do not know
 how i shall get this sent to the colony but edmonton to the colony we had quite a busy time
 getting i shall keep it in readiness for the next opportunity i am all them all supper it is the
 custom here for anyone to go to alone today as the ards and terry are all in the colony get
 a shack for a meal but it used a lot of our small stock of ting provisions whither they went
 with my last letters home flour we have nearly finished the sack of flour and i fear and one for
 dear father s birthday another followed them if the boys do not hurry up we shall have to eat the
 mouldy 21 lot which we have been giving to the hens though sutton poles onto the roof of his shack
 and he only had one hammer and i have been having most of our meals with an englishman i got
 miserably cold so i came up here about 4 p m and who lives about a mile and a half
 from here he is a very chopped a lot of firewood and made a supper of flapjacks nice man and
 i expect sutton and i will be helping him to he came up with sutton and we had a warm
 evening round put the roof on his shack while the boys are away i heard the stove a most quaint
 legend about some remarkably tame birds they yesterday was colder still but the wind had dropped and call them whisky
 jacks the legend says that they are the as brown had some fairly warming work on hand cutting ghosts of
 departed lumber men who first settled in canada frozen plough sods and loading a wagon with them hen lift of
 course it is very absurd but they are weird ing hem onto the roof of his shack i went down
 there and 7 30 p m i am alone tonight as sutton is going to sleep spent most of the
 day doing that afterwards coming up here down at brown s as all my bedding is up her e i
 shall stay and preparing wood and supper for him to stay the night i think it will be warmer than
 his stable brown has to sleep the last few nights we have had a tin of r oast beef to
 eat in his stable until his shack is finished it is very lonely spend with the flapjacks an unwonted luxury
 these tins were ing a night in a log house by oneself out on the prairie with brought up from
 the colony by some people who were on no one nearer than a mile and a half it was trying
 to snow their way to edmonton today is sunday it is now nearly this evening but the clouds have now
 broken a bit the wind two months since i have been to church or indeed have even is blowing very
 hard and it must be well below zero today seen one the last time was on the 11 th september
 in while brown was boiling a kettle for dinner out in the open edmonton on a camp stove some of
 the water which was on the out one gets very tired of flour and water varied with occaside of the
 lid froze hard while the water inside was boiling sional potatoes and extra salt bacon it will be a fortnight
 it is freezing in here near the window or did before i drew tomorrow since terence went to lloydminster and
 getting the fire up and put more wood on on for a fortnight since tom went lloydminster seems to there
 is something outside which sounds very much like possess much the same sort of magnetic attraction that gloua bear i
 could have sworn i heard some heavy footsteps go cester used to do when they lived with us past the
 door and just now something seemed to give the walls yesterday we thawed some frozen boiled rice on a stove
 a thump outside i have just put one of my cases against the in the open and while we were
 eating it if we paused it fr oze door as it has neither hinges nor proper fastenings only some on
 the spoon the worst of this shack is that it has no door rather feeble buttons made of some short
 pieces of stick with only a few boards nailed together with wide cracks open to a nail through the centre
 i do not think a bear has ever been the outside it has no hinges or fastenings and is fixed
 up known to enter a shack of course it may be the logs shrink by propping against the aperture so
 you can imagine the cold ing with the cold we have had so many false alarms before air that sweeps
 across the already frozen mud floor even when about bears the day before yesterday i went to brown s to
 we hang coats and rugs over the door the poor fowls are see if i could do anything for him
 but he was nailing the in a sad plight as will got all the chicken food he was bringing godfrey
 edssards lised in a tent shen he first arrived in the vermilion district 22 last time eaten by somebody else
 s ravenous fowls where he the captain did not arrive and while lord and stopped the night these poor things
 are nearly starving we i were talking a rancher overheard and he asked me to come gave them some mouldy
 flour mixed with water and all the to his place for six months at 10 a month on the condition
 scraps we could get but it is not much of a feed for fowls that if i left before i
 was to forfeit payment i told him that in his weather all their combs are frost bitten and gone quite
 i would be glad to try it for three months and might very yellow it seems almost cruel not to
 shoot them and there likely stay for six my future boss is a very nice man and is hardly any
 good flour left i get some of my meals where said that i can see the captain on the subject
 of work and i work and the chap brings up some of his provisions when if i don t go
 there i can come along with him he says that he sleeps here at the captain s i shall learn
 nothing of horsemanship as they yesterday a party of six brothers i think came along the are both that is
 lord and the captain beginners trail on their way to edmonton we asked them if terence who think they know
 all about horses and therefore will be and the others were on their way they said none had started a
 great time learning themselves but of course the rancher when they left they had to sleep out in the open
 having is in need of someone to work for him he says that with missed some place in the dark
 they had to take turns two him i shall learn a lot and he hopes in a short while to
 leave at a time to keep up a big fire poor fellows they must have me in charge of the
 ranch as he himself is often away and been cold the eldest had a large moustache which was one i
 should be the only one there he is a small rancher having mass of ice on one side from his
 breath how i long for our about 80 head of horses and a few cattle i quite expect a lot
 to retum with the next letters well i must do some work large part of my education in bronco busting
 will be at the although sunday to keep warm and help our neighbour to end of a hoof or two
 but that is a common jape i told him get the roof on his house poor chap he does not
 find living that i was an absolute greenhorn with horses in a stable very comfortable this weather his shack wants
 we are fifty miles from the rockies and they look just as chinking you d call it plastering as well
 if you could throw a stone at them and knock the top off like terence m keone all the settlers
 in the here is just in the foothills and from the top of a hill like one of the lower
 malverns you get a view of a magnificent district were all equally hard up so young god stretch of mountain
 scenery i have for the last two mornfrey edwards went to calgary to try and earn ings for the sake
 of exercise gone up this hill which is as some money he was barely eighteen years old steep as a
 side of a house nearly and on monday morning and not very strong physically which was got nght into the
 clouds as we are here nearly as high as zermatt so that the clouds are always very low and that
 is another reason why he had been sent out to the what i attribute the intensity of the thunderstorms to
 while pure clean air of canada in order to get back i was up there a severe thunderstorm came up
 fr om the his health he got work at a r anch near cochrane rockies of which i had an
 excellent view but i felt it advisand was much more hopeful in may 1904 he able to beat a hasty
 retreat however it passed by a few miles wrote home telling how he had got the job off i have
 just come in from cleaning the livery stables here i am as you see by the address still in another
 place a an occupation which has helped to pass the time my boss little town of about 35 wooden houses
 and log shacks may pull out today i hope so but all the ranchers put away cochr ane is the
 centr e of the gr eat r anching district of the a surprising amount of drink and he is no
 exception to the north west and the rector comes out here every first and nile but i hope funds are
 getting low and he will start out third sunday in he month to hold services he thought i had as
 he intends today i shall be able to see the rector sometimes better come up here and meet some of
 the ranchers and ask when i go to church here the ranch is about ten miles north for a job
 so i came up but sunday was an abominable day of cochrane with a snowstorm or blizzard and not a
 rancher turned up godfrey s parents were worried about their and the offertory was just five cents so he went
 back and young son being with a rancher who drank so i remained to tackle all and sundy on the
 subject of work there is a certain lord out here and also a captain an earl s they wrote to
 a fnend in calgary asking him to nephew who have both come out to start ianching the rector arrange something
 better for their boy unforand his wife met them at easter and found them charming tunately there was not much
 work available a men and he hoped i would see either one or the other so little later godfrey wrote
 his parents another when a very fair haired blue eyed young man walked into letter about his change of plans
 without realizing the inn with an unmistakable aristocratic appearance in spite of cowboy getup i guessed who he was right
 away and mak that his parents had manoeuvred the change ing his acquaintance found him an awfully nice chap he
 lam writing a few lines to tell you that lam feeling perfect ly said that i might get a job
 with the captain for whom he was well and i think that i am as well as i have ever
 been for working himself and that he hoped i would as it would make the last ten years i fear
 i have not half the time to tell you it easier for him to attend to the horses while i
 did some of a quarter of what i would like i have been working 17 hours the other work he
 expected the captain would arrive by that a day getting up at 4 30 and riding bare back for 1
 ½ hours night s tain with his wife fr om calgary but he had been ill rounding up cows and
 then hor ses then ten minutes for with tonsilitis and it was possible he would have to stay br eakfast
 then an 8 mile drive with much jumping down to longer in which case i had better try someone else
 open gates then work of shack building until 6 or half past i asked the chap if there was a
 friend of the captain who then 8 miles home ten minutes for tea then feeding pigs was a lord just
 starting and did he know him my corn separating milk chopping wood turning a grind stone by panion laughed and
 said yes that s myself which time it is sometimes 9 to 10 p m then i try and sleep
 lord was sent out here virtually to drink himself but the owner of the ranch sits up sometimes until 3
 am to death that is his great failing but the captain has taken rattling dice with a friend about 3
 yards above my head and him in hand and i believe he is a great deal better talking to beat
 the band 23 during the early development of the vermilion area the stewarts operated a post office and general store
 seen at centre in 1904 a week later he still thought of himself as an englishman and on sunday i
 had a letter from the rector to say that he was terribly homesick would not be in cochrane again so
 i had to go to calgary to see him about my affairs i stayed with him until tues things are
 poor and black generally but i shall still try day and saw your friend and on their advice left the
 ranch to hope and make my motto it s a long lane that has no they said they knew the
 place and that it was not at all turning well old fellow we did have a really good time desirable
 so now i am staying with the captain for a few at christmas and new year and do so every
 now and again days after all he said that it is practically impossible to get dances and concerts and sleigh
 rides this is a really good a job this time of year for inexperienced or green hands so winter as
 there are only 4 or 5 inches of snow and the sun i fear i shall have eventually to go
 back to vermilion where is out most of the time and as yet we haven t had it below i
 have an invitation to help some friends at any time this 25 degrees below zero summer even though it is
 nearly over they are both from you don t know how glad i am about godfrey going to gloucestershire a
 clergyman s sons i think and we were mcgill university he doesn t know how interested i am in fine
 friends last winter if i go i shall walk there are houses him oh harold none of you can ever
 know how miserable nearly all the way now it will be exercise and open air and i sometimes feel and
 i have no real pal out her e that i can a five hundred mile walk will be an adventure
 i should be tell my all like i can to you able to keep up 30 miles a day which
 should get me almost well old man it will be a hard fight for me to keep my there in
 about 17 days or say 20 i have more muscle than location you see ploughing even when you do it
 yourself i had and i weigh 6 pounds more than last year i hope harold costs money and if a
 fellow hasn t a horse to plough with is quite well again it costs more and as i haven t
 got either money or a team godfrey did walk to vermilion where he found it looks like losing my homestead
 as it is i have had a row with one official who tried to take it but i proved that
 i was his friends hugh evans and lance playne and improving it the shack and stables have been built i
 am hel pe d them for the rest of the autunm and winter getting out fence poles and hope to
 have enough to fence all of 1904 and spring and summer of 1905 in that my quarter at first i
 shall only fence the piece i hope to autumn he was accepted at mcgill university and plough if possible went
 off with high hopes to start his studying man you can t think what it feels like not to hear
 a woman s voice that is a good clear english voice the cana he enjoyed himself in montreal but shortly
 after dians all speak with a twang and their voices are tired tired he had graduated with honours in every
 subject and they sing like cats on hot bricks all strained because they he was struck down with meningitis and
 died are so tired all the time i ve been out here i haven t seen three days later he
 was only twenty three a really pretty girl some are a bit pretty but none that a fellow would rave
 about the life is much too hard for them and meanwhile early in 1905 terence m keone they are exhausted
 who was still homesteading on vermilion river wrote to godfrey s brother harold in england the whole of 1905 was
 very difficult he did 24 manage to plough some land in the spring but elbow both are absolutely well about
 the kick it doesn t when filling out the government form he slightly hurt unless i lift things or put
 any extra strain then it does misjudged the amount he had done in the badly in boots i can walk
 well enough but in moccasins i limp and am slow owing to no heel it seems that the heels autumn
 when he fenced it he realized his mis on the boots raise my foot so that the muscles on the
 back take and so he wrote to the government giving of the leg are not strained doe says i shall
 never be much the correct measurement he then received a very better i m afraid that it shows ins bad
 habit of a short sharp irate letter from a junior office clerk demanding temper in the form of many wonderful
 words some i m afraid blasphemous and all learnt out here and truly canadian i to know why his returns
 did not agree the tone try to control it truly i do of the letter infuriated young m keone taking
 there is a fellow who has worried me for some money i pen to paper he wrote sir i ploughed
 the land owed him and i was worrying another fellow who owed me in spring while the soul was still
 moist from the so that i could pay the first the fellow i worried said he snow as you know
 we have had an exceptionally couldn t collect some that was owing to him but if i would take a
 note in hand that the fellow owed him he would give long hot and dry summer even a damn fool
 it to me so i said i would if the other fellow was safe to knows that land shrinks in
 dry weather t h pay well he then produced the iou which was on the man m ‘ keone i
 owed it appears now that a worries c me in order to having let off steam by writing the letter
 pay b and c me worried b to pay a and b worried a all in a circle three of
 us worrying to satisfy one and all terence ploughed the extra bit and then wrote we couldn t help having
 a bit of a laugh although that bill another letter to harold in time for christmas caused not a little
 unpleasant feeling at first 1905 terence wrote another letter to harold early quite a time since i wrote you last
 for some time past in 1907 just as his friend was preparing to join i have been losing myself with
 a man called walker we have him in western canada been nding round after his cattle that were lost this
 riding did me good in mind and body although not much in pocket talk of gold mines they have or
 are supposed to have found still i don t give a damn as long as i don t get into
 any more large gold fields near battlefoni some man found two nuggets debt i am not quite as bad as
 before but still on that side in a pipe of his pump and set the rumour going of course well
 to more cheerful subjects my house is finished hay lots of fools ran and staked out claims for which they
 had ing been altered many times lam going if possible to build to pay 5 to the man owning the
 pump and a royalty on all on another room for eva or kathleen say 12 x 14 i want gold
 found to the government in this way mr pump man them to have a good room to themselves and they
 would cleared up some 1000 and the fools are still digging maybe get a really good view of the town
 across the valley down one man will strike a find and make a bit of money as there to the
 river i have six acres broke and begin to think i am is gold throughout this country in tiny quantities
 i would a farmer and now i can milk a cow if i take time at it my sooner be
 the man that owned the pump but if he is wise fingers are not really supple enough yet though they
 seem he will go to some more congenial clime until the storm blows to be getting looser over and the

 gold pieces coined in u s in one of the 1850 s it also relates that there are only five
 coins of that issue now known and they are valued at 10 000 where are the others in the cypress
 hills probably here is the story six men had stolen 50 000 in gold pieces in the united states and
 fled north to canada they got as far as the cypress hills where they divided into two parties two of
 the men got 10 000 the other four 40 000 the party was captured by indians and all but one
 were killed he escaped and came back in a few years but could not find the cache for the scenery

 and the rebellion by william cousins we who had been living in medicine hat the first real benefit that came
 to us locally gave no thought to rumours we saw in the eastern was because they gave captain jack stewart
 a papers about riel starting up another rebellion rancher near fort macleod who was well known in our ignor ance
 we thought that even if this in ottawa authority to organize a company of crazy halfbreed could muster up a
 few followers ranchers and cowboys this he did he got somehe and they would soon be put in jail by
 the thing over eighty men used to ranching together police we didn t know of any reason they had a
 horse and accoutrement for every man and a for making trouble they had plenty as we soon supply of extra
 horses he called his company found out the halfbreeds that we had living in the rocky mountain rangers and was
 the first our midst were fine people industrious and peace real organization in the west to be in service to
 loving we knew we would have no trouble with help put down the rebellion their camp was hem and if
 we thought of it at all it was to laugh close to our town at first but stewart thought at
 the fears of our friends and relatives who had they were too close in and he moved up the river
 the impression that we were risking our lives to near where the power house now stands right daily in a
 country inhabited by bear s wolves and on the river bank his horsemen would form up indians as real cavalry
 and parade through our streets suddenly we got news that at prince albert nearly every day many miles north of
 the railway people had been the next contingent we got was the halifax killed among them skiff elliott a boyhood
 provisional battalion infantrymen under colonel friend from london ontario this news was james bremner they got here by train about
 two brought to us by a police scout who could be weeks after the rangers they were a couple of
 depended upon of course we were frightened hundred strong including officers and went into my partner who had been on
 a trip east to visit camp on the hill near where the high school now friends and his best girl
 was in winnipeg on his is the first thing they did was to dig trenches way back i wired him
 to send firearms and and rifle pits along the brow of the hill then ammunition which he did and at
 the same time they got their camp into good shape and laid out sent word he would stay where he
 was until he a rifle range across the river where the golf club found out for sure what was going
 on and what is we felt much safer when all this addition to was best to do our small population
 was completed we had a meeting in medicine hat at once while this was going on troops were being a
 home guard was formed thomas tweed who brought up to swift current and from there had military experience was elected
 captain bob marched twenty nine miles to saskatchewan mccutcheon drill sergeant every man in the landing where barges were being
 built to take community that could walk made up the balance the soldiers their equipment and supplies down of the
 home guards we drilled every night and the river to prince albert other troops were passsoon got into fighting shape
 a night guard was ing here on their way to calgary and edmonton picked out in turns for guard duty
 the guard as things developed it was found that the blackroom was in bill anderton s photograph gallery foot bloods
 sarcees and stoneys were being the women took turns in providing coffee and encouraged by riel and his fellow halfbreeds
 to sandwiches for the guard while we felt this join with the crees and themselves making would help it was
 not enough we wired the prince albert and batoche their fighting ground government for guns and ammunition any kind they
 sent us cases of snyder rifles and soft nosed the author was one of the pioneer businessmen of cartr idges
 to fit i have one of those rifles hang medicine hat in the l 930 s he wrote a series
 of ing up in my den it hasn t been fired off for fifty reminiscences which were published in the
 lethbridge years we kept continually at our friends in the herald under the title of old timer tells this article

 ra a officers of the halifax provisional battalion were photographed in medicine hat in june of 1885 both colonel bremner
 and captain jack in a new country there were many of these kind stewart were men of some considerable experi
 of mistakes made before the rebellion was quelled ence in military matters colonel bremner had and a lot more lives
 lost than there need have his experience from being a volunteer officer in been halifax but he had no knowledge
 of western it was entirely different with captain stewart ways he was known as a strict and careful he had
 served as a volunteer officer in ottawa officer well thought of by those in his command as a young man
 before coming west and engag they respected him because he took good care ing in ranching near macleod he had
 in his of them and saw that they got the best in equip rocky mountain rangers some distinguished ment and
 supplies that were obtainable he knew gentlemen lord boyle his brother the hon very well how to protect his men
 if they were henry boyle kootenai brown captain attacked by regular troops as soldiers one against brown british ex army
 officer nd other s whose another he did not know how to fight the kind names i have forgotten then
 he had the regular of enemies he would be up against in his home cow punchers and all of these
 men had been land the indians and halfbreeds had lived their living in the north west territories for some time
 lives in this wide open country they made their before the outbreak of the rebellion what they living by hunting
 wild game buffalo deer lacked in discipline they made up in knowing the geese ducks and such like these at
 times were work they were supposed to do plentiful and at other times were hard to find and stewart knew
 our captain of the home guard kill tom tweed stewart had lived in ottawa and col bremner s thought was
 to dig trenches tweed in cornwall and they were pleased to get and rifle pits on the hillside as his
 first move together again naturally they talked about the it was a mistake of course but natural to anyone rebellion
 and how come stewart could get his 28 crowd together on such favourable terms as he our side won all
 those competitions except the explained to tweed tug of war the halifax boys knew all the tricks stewart s idea
 was to take up no permanent in this strenuous game and we could never pull camp but to scout the
 country over and see where them across the line to our side there was any chance of the western indians
 i have been laughed at for expressing the bloods blackfoot stoneys peigans joining the opinion that riel was the saviour
 of the west for crees and helping them in their raid on the north a greater dominion of canada if
 he had not country he was here only a short time waiting started the rebellion when he did the c
 p r for instructions from ottawa when bremner and would never have been completed the syndicate his battalion arrived so
 unexpectedly and began was at the end of its resources and would have to dig the trenches on the hill
 gone broke they had been pleading with the when colonel bremner came into the post macdonald government for the loan
 of nine office to get acquainted and his mail he asked million dollars sir john could not secure the sup
 tweed who it was that occupied those tents up port required his cabinet was divided and public the river when
 tweed explained the situation opinion was well known to be against making as he understood it the colonel expressed sur
 the loan the talk on the streets was that it would prise that stewart had not reported to him never
 be repaid and canada would be ruined perhaps said tweed stewart is wondering when the rebellion started everyone saw that
 the why you have not reported to him he was here only thing to do under the circumstances was to
 before you were and is entitled to know your protect the lives of all those living on the western standing
 whether you are an enemy or a recruit prairies this saved the syndicate and meant the this misunderstanding created a
 rather hard building of a nation that could not have been feeling between our protectors for a time the accomplished

 letter from our member in the federal the afternoon and on going home as they were house archie mitchell just
 a few weeks after on horseback it was easy for them to go up the he took his seat in
 the first session of that august hill and see what the other boys were doing they body in 1935 in
 his letter he stated that a man would laugh at the feet soldiers as they called named james gerrard had
 written to him asking them and when leaving would turn their horses him to use his influence to get from
 the dominion loose among the tent ropes some of the ropes government a fr ee homestead because he gerr ard
 would not be able to stand the strain and there had been a member of the medicine hat home would
 be an occasional tent left flat on the guard during the rebellion in 1885 gerrard ground however this did not
 last long we were referred to me as one who knew him when he all in the same boat as
 the sailors say and you was a private in that company he said he was must co operate when you
 are in that fix sure i could prove what he claimed to be and that due to the protection offered
 by the military i would write a letter recommending him for a which was satisfactory as far as we could
 see free homestead he also said he was broke and less interest in the home guard developed on the relief
 list in saskatchewan attendance at drill fell away to such an extent i wrote to our member stating that i
 knew that our drill sergeant bob mccutcheon made gerrard he delivered water to us every day and the complaint one
 night that there were more brought our goods from the c p r station to the officers than privates in
 his company and unless store and did a general dray business in town therd would be more of the latter

 as well disband for why he should be given a homestead because he he was going to quit attendance next
 night was turned out to protect himself and others from made up of a few officers and very few privates
