 ton in edmonton so the rev george mc bring the buffalo into the runway and dougall offered to take him
 to victoria thence into the corral before attempt william borwick took him down there ing to drive the buffalo in
 the direction with dogs i helped to nurse him but of the corral a medicine man went he died one
 night when i was sitting up out and planted a line of sticks about with him mrs mcdougall went to
 great eight feet apart in prolongation of one trouble in preparing him for burial we side of the entrance runway
 then the thought that since he was dead she was drive began as soon as the buffalo doing too much
 she replied she was came up to the line of sticks they aponly doing what his mother would like peared
 to fear it and galloped down to have done i have never forgotten along the line of sticks thence into
 the that he was buried at victoria on a runway and finally into the corral in gravel hill close to
 the mission this way some three hundred were im in the spring of 1867 dave mcdougall pounded and the slaughter
 began all and i arranged to go to montana re the buffalo in the corral were killed al verend george
 mcdougall asked us to though a number of them were in such stay for the wedding of his daughter vic
 poor condition as to be worthless i toria eliza to richard hardisty which called the attention of the chief to
 this was shortly to come off while waiting and suggested that the poor animals i mined on a bar at
 sucker creek just a should be turned loose in reply he little below where the sturgeon joins the stated that
 this was never done as the saskatchewan i made from 16 to 18 buffalo which might be turned loose per
 day in the fall john whitford a would tell the others of the trap and half breed of victoria and
 i went out thereafter no buffalo might be caught in hunting buffalo at about where vegre this way the head
 men of the camp yule now stands but we had no luck then went into the corral and put cer
 whitford went back to victoria but i tam marked sticks on each carcass this went on with the indians for
 about 125 was the method adopted of dividing the miles further south where we struck the killed amongst all the
 indians present buffalo in large numbers the plains when this system of division was comwere alive with them large numbers
 pleted the women and children came in of indians had been drawn there by the and the skinning cleaning and
 cutting presence of the buffalo and i would say up process was finished up i became on that there were
 100 indian families in very good terms with these indians and camp spent the winter of 1867 68 with them
 the method used by these indians to victoria was first built as a methodist mission capture the buffalo was interesting
 they by the mcdougalls with the hudson s bay cornbuilt a large corral of heavy timbers pany following with a
 fort this is a view of about two acres in extent with a narrow the post in 1884 from a
 rare photograph in the ernest brown collection victoria was located entrance and runway the idea was to near the present
 settlement of pakan in the spring of 1868 i came back to became the race track the hudson s edmonton
 john brown of brown and bay company had a horse power flour currie whose store was later built a few
 mill for grinding doors east of the alberta hotel and jim when the indians and half breeds reid who farmed
 opposite fort saskat went to the plains for buffalo and the chewan for many years had both come boats had
 gone down the river there was to edmonton in 1866 they had attempted practically nothing to eat around the to
 go to montana in 1867 but had been fort except what could be shot the driven back by the blackfeet
 who were company servants used to be given a at that time on the war path charlie gun and ammunition
 to rustle their own stephenson english charlie charlie living in those days we could buy clark and mike shannon and
 myself pemmican from the company and as the also wanted to go to montana but in company servants did not
 attach very view of the experience of brown and great value to the flour we used to buy reid we
 decided to go by way of winni their flour from them at 30 a bag we peg to avoid the
 blackfeet we there used to mix a little of this with stewed fore left edmonton in the spring of 1868
 pemmican which made it more palatable with john norris who was a trader very little sugar was obtainable and tea
 around and about edmonton to winni cost 3 00 a pound peg from there we intended to go to fort
 abercrombie we reached aber donald ross came to edmonton in crombie and found that the sioux were 1872 in 1874
 he started the first real on the war path so i came back to garden on ground just below the
 old winnepg and the others stayed at fort donald ross hotel about this time the abercrombie i then decided to
 go back hudson s bay company made its selecto edmonton with a lot of half breeds tion of land now
 known as the hudson s who were coming up that way and bay reserve malcolm groat took the reached edmonton
 in august 1868 the land west of 121 st street and leslie two charlies got back later in the fall

 rev george mc bar and rusty bar we invented the dougall s daughters too the piece of grizzly it worked
 all right and we land on the flats lying east of the hudmade about 16 per day son s bay
 reserve and now known as in 1865 oats were grown on the hud ross flats donald ross acquired this land
 from leslie wood son s bay field where the present power house now stands and potatoes had been there were
 on clover bar in the fall grown on the same ground for some of 1868 about fifteen rigs i remember
 eighty years previously this was the some of them beaupre later of fort talk of the men around the fort
 the oats saskatchewan zeb hamler ex u s solhad become very light owing to in dier jim reid dan mccauley
 mcfarbreeding and the potatoes from the same land and the two charlie s our cause were not much bigger than
 my difficulty in making the grizzlies was fingers i found potatoes barley and to procure the necessary iron in those
 oats growing in edmonton in 1865 the days the hudson s bay company made barley was the best crop a
 bag of po all their nails from iron rods and we tatoes and a bag of imported flour was bought
 as much of this material from the hudson s bay ration to each man them as they would give us
 the result there was another field just behind the was that this iron became very scarce hudson s bay store
 which was called and grizzlies were very valuable the new field this field afterward to be continued fishing trip a
 fishing party left on saturday night for a couple of days sport up mill creek and returned with one poor
 trout as the result of their expedition the reason for this poor take has not leaked out but it seems
 that their bait was less fortunate whether the stopper was a misfit or the escape of the precious liquid was
 due to a crack in the bottle they do not explain at all events they found the weather too cold
 for comfortable fishing pincher creek echo sept 8 1903 black white man by hugh a dempsey some time in the
 late 1830 s a man named henry mills arrived at fort union on the missouri river with chief trader kenneth
 mckenzie and began working us a laborer for the american fur company at once the blackfeet were impressed with the
 man they treated him with more than customary friendliness cind invited him to their camps he in turn accepted their
 offers and soon became great friends with many of the leading wurriors this comradeship was no surprise to sion that
 pierre bungo was the oddest the men at the post for mills was a negro specimen of a white man
 that they had and the colored race had always been ever seen a source of curiosity and wonderment to this
 idea that a negro was an unthe plains indians the few people of usual variety of white man rather than
 negro extraction who were drawn to the a separate race is revealed most clearly western frontier found they were in
 a in the blackfoot language to them a class by themselves and were considered negro was a six apekwan or
 black white by the indians in a much more favorable man likely because the first negroes light than their white
 employers appeared singly and in company with the first record of a negro on the white traders caused them to

 was divided between the traders whom the whites called phillisy she and the bloods sometimes they lived at had been
 married to a white man whom the fort and on other occasions they the bloods called okotok or the stone

 way to whoopthe bloods when they were attacked by up when the train was attacked by the a war party
 of pend d orielle indians assiniboines recalled the son the in the battle mary was swept up by one white

 it was then my fawas received that the girl had not been ther called out to them in blaokfoot not
 killed instead she had become the un to attack one of the assiniboines who willing wife of her captor and
 bore him could speak blackfoot said â€˜ who are a son in their mountain camp finally you she succeeded in
 making her escape and returned to the bloods with the small my father thought quickly he knew child this boy
 named lone man grew that the bloods were fierce enemies of up with the bloods and became a promi the
 assiniboines while the peigans who nent member of the tribe also are part of the blackfoot nation were friendly with
 them so he cried out after the arrival of the mounted po â€˜ i am scabby bull of the peigans
 lice mills spent most of his time with the bloods and was with them when he so because they thought
 a member died in 1878 of a friendly tribe was with the train they did not attack but let it
 go un but it is the life of dave mills the harmed to whoop up child of a negro father
 and a blood indian mother which showed that race during the years he worked as a bullor color was no
 detriment to an ambitious whacker mills revealed that he had inand intelligent frontiersman herited much of the superstitious fears from
 both sides of his family he told young dave had a varied career as how when he was en route
 to whoopa bullwhacker scout and interpreter up he and some white men stopped for both in montana and alberta during
 the night in a small deserted shack these years he was looked upon as a there they found a stain
 of blood on the friend and advisor by the whites and the floor where they suspected that someone indians alike
 had been killed but having no place dave s son is still living on the blood else to go they
 settled down to sleep reserve and like his father he was born then during the night the men heard among
 the bloods and is considered to a great clamor as though someone was be a member of the tribe he
 has full throwing stones through the windows treaty rights and is one of the respected and pushing the cupboards over
 dave patriarchs on the reserve because he and the white men were frightened but is a close neighbor i have
 come to know when morning came they found that harry mills he was baptized henry after nothing had been disturbed
 and no his grandfather very well and it was stones could be found inside the shack with his help that
 the history of his dave always maintained that the ghost family was compiled of the dead man had caused all
 the my father s indian name was api trouble kanis stumik or scabby bull he told me when the mounted
 police came to in his boyhood days he was raised just southern alberta in 1874 and stopped like any other
 boy in the blood camps the whiskey trade dave divided his time then when he was about fifteen or six
 between the bloods and visiting his old teen he started working for i g baker 3 cen sits of the
 county of chotean state of montana co as a bullwhacker i think this is territory july 1870 this original document
 is in where he learned to speak english he the montana historical society library in helena they could get larger
 rations and more treaty money mills work was so appreciated by the government that in 1884 the agent wrote his
 conduct has been highly satisfactory and through his knowledge of the bloods he has been mainly the means of saving
 the govt several thousands of dollars last year it was almost entirely through his actions that a reduction of one
 thousand souls was made 7 although he undoubtedly caused some anger and embarassment when he proved that a woman claiming
 to have six children really had only one or that an old warrior who swore he was a blood was
 really an american peigan he still made no bitter enemies besides being raised as one of them dave had qualities
 which all the indians admired he was a powerful man and was one of the best runners in the camp
 also his knowledge and control of horses was such that it provided him with considerable local fame an example occurred
 when the indian department bought two horses which were so wild that mills was the only man who could use
 them whenever he hitched them to the wagon the indians would get their best horses and try to race him
 but with dave in control of the two powerful animals he left the indian cayuses in the dust dave mills
 father in benton it was during this period he took a job as scout and received a severe knife wound
 in his arm which left a deep scar that he carried to his grave in 1880 when the first indian
 agent was appointed for southern alberta dave was hired as his interpreter but mills then a young man of twenty
 five showed too much favoritism towards red crow the head chief and was dismissed however two years later when cecil
 denny took over the agent s post he im as an interpreter dave experienced a certain amount of trouble in
 translating blackfoot names into english but he was far better than most men of that period his work was often
 complicated by the fact that a warrior might have two or three names or might give one away and take
 a new one for example a minor chief who signed treaty seven was known as white calf but when another
 minor chief named father of many children passed away white calf took his name so dave always had to remember
 that when the white people talked about father of many children they meant the dead one but when the indians
 used the name they were referring to the man the whites called white calf mediately re hired mills at the
 salary of 35 a month and rations dave had apparently learned his lesson for he began a service with the
 indian department which was interrupted only once during the rest of his active life he no longer displayed any favoritism
 but proved to be of tremendous value both to the wary indians and the budgetconscious government one of his first
 services was in helping to detect south peigan indians who were under treaty in montana attempting to pass themselves off
 as bloods so they could collect the annual treaty money also his ability to remember and classify the names of
 individuals and sizes of families played an impor tant part in stopping the bloods from t letter william pocklington to
 the indian conimis falsifying their numbers the padding siomier sept 30 1884 a copy is in possession of of their
 population was a trick used so the author there were other examples just as dave s only break with the
 indian decomplicated but gradually mills was partment occurred for a few months in able to set down a standard list
 which 1900 when he resigned his position folwas used in the treaty books lowing his reappointment he remained in the
 1880 s dave married a blood on the job until he became so crippled woman named poosa or the cat
 with with rheumatism he could no longer per father lacombe performing the cere form his duties but he was so
 highly mony when his wife died in 1903 regarded by the government that he was mills married holy rabbit woman
 a kept on special pension until his death daughter of a great war chief named me on april 9 th
 1918 dicine calf a few days later the lethbridge her dave had five children three of whom aid carried a
 brief item from their macare still living on the blood reserve one leod correspondent telling about the boy born soon
 after the turn of the cen death a real old timer passed away tury died before he was old enough
 to tuesday night in the person of dave receive a christian name but dave mills stated the item he had
 been called him napekwan or white man be ailing for some time and drove in from cause as he jokingly
 stated i was one his farm near the blood reserve last of the first white men in the country week
 and was taken to the hospital where the end came dave mills or old during all his years of close
 contact dave as he was known came to alberta with the bloods dave never tried to be during the early
 days of the traders as admitted into treaty as he feared such his language was that of the bloods a
 move might jeopardize his government his mother was a blood woman and his position his homestead was just across father
 a colored man 8 the belly river from the indian agency here he had a quarter section of land a
 thus died a humble man whose work neat log house and a small farm was of great importance among one
 of the most warlike tribes in alberta he although most of his close friends was a solid link between the
 government were bloods he was popular with the and the indians and was trusted by both white settlers his best
 friend was tony sides he also showed that a man from lachappelle a french canadian trader the red race or
 the black roce or both who had followed the bloods to their re could gain respect and prestige on the
 serve in 1881 and had built a trading canadian frontier post on the belly river not far from mills homestead
 8 the lethbridge herald april 11 1918 honor was restored there is at present at cardston one young lady who
 will not allow slanderers to say what they please about her it seems that one of the men in the
 town made some objectionable remarks about her which came to her ears she promptly armed herself with a revolver and
 went in search of her traducer met him on one of the principle streets and aimed her weapon at him
 ordering him to get down on his knees he looked wildly around for some means of escape but seeing none
 dropped abjectly upon his marrow bones his movements being considerably accelerated by the significant flourishing of the revolver in this
 ignominious posture he remained while the spirited young lady completed his abasement by forcing him to make an ample and
 abject apology on being allowed to depart the man swore out a warrant czgainst the young lady and had her
 brought before the magistrate who fined her ten dollars and costs the macleod gazette june 15 1900 early railroading in

 what was beyond the hills in the distance r what would be disclosed around the next bend in the river
 these were some of the thrills experienced when engaged in railway location the vast expanse of the peace river see

 the building and i heard hall removat mile 66 and soon crews were working ing the bar to the door
 i asked what out of it the track was ballasted for is the matter he replied the bears some distance
 towards edmonton are besieging me i have not been away from the cache for days adding that now that the

 returned to for danger there however by exten the railroad in june of 1919 traders of the early west sir
 cecil denny part 2 the two largest firms at fort beriton in the 1870 s were those of i g
 baker co and t c powers these firms had steamers of their own running between benton and st louis i
 g baker resided in st louis and the brothers c h and w c conrad carried on the business the
 firm of t c powers did most of their business in montana having large contracts with the american government to
 furnish supplies to the different military posts in the territory this firm also did a large trade in furs principally
 buffalo robes with the indians having trading posts scattered through montana both the firms of i g baker co and
 t c powers besides owning several steamers on the missouri river used bull teams for land transport these consisted of
 twelve and fourteen yoke of oxen drawing three immense wagons which were covered with canvas tops these trains would contain
 often as much as 30 000 lbs or over five tons to the wagon with three or four wagons comprising
 a team their rate of progress was slow as most of their journey was across the prairie without roads ten
 miles would be considered a good day s journey while often only half that distance would be made should any
 rivers have to be crossed there were generally eight teams of 24 wagons in a train so they carried an
 enormous amount of freight there were other firms in fort benton but none did anything like the trade done by
 the two before mentioned the firm of wetzel and co did a large wholesale liquor business high wines or alcohol
 being principally dealt in for the indian trade the spirits were above proof and could be diluted many times with
 water on reaching the trading posts in montana or alberta before it was dealt out to the indians fort benton
 was long noted for supplying the indians with liquor arms and ammunition such was this trade that the miners in
 montana who had suffered from indian attacks had threatened on more than one occasion to burn the stores sir cecil
 denny of the traders if the practice was not halted but no attention was paid to their threats and the
 trade went merrily on as i have before stated steamers could navigate the missouri river from fort benton to st
 louis or new orleans without breaking bulk it took about thirty days to ascend the river from omaha to benton

 he managed to crawl to the bow river man he was many years afterwards and by swimming and wading kept

 altogether by bull teams however prospecting trip taken by himself and sometimes four horse teams with wagons party in 1869
 into the porcupine hills would be used in which case many not far west of the present town of fort
 would travel together for protection but macleod he stated that they found very it was seldom they got through without
 rich placer diggings and collected with having several of their horses stolen by very little trouble a fortune in gold
 nug indians the bull teams were exempt gets but they were attacked by piegans from the raids of war parties
 as the or blackfeet indians and all killed except indians never bothered the cattle himself he never returned to search
 for four to six men generally comprised the lost placer and it is hard to tell if the crew of
 a bull train the driver there was any truth in his story walked along beside his team and had the
 porcupine hills have been gone a whip with a tremendous length of over by many prospecting parties but nothing was
 ever discovered however remember rightly valued at about 60 there are still many indications that there is no doubt that
 at some time the point to gold in that vicinity gold nug cow had licked up this gold probably gets
 have been traded by southern in some saline place where cattle often indians at the hudson s bay post at
 lick up considerable sand or mud look edmonton and although miners had ing for salt washed fine gold on the
 bars of the many unrecorded tragedies occurred saskatchewan river for many years the in alberta in the early days and
 if true gold traded by the indians could under accounts could have been obtained of no consideration have been procured
 them would have made a sad page in from that source the early history of the country the another curious
 circumstance regard police on their arrival at the oldman ing gold in the porcupine hills is an river and after
 fort macleod was built occurrence that took place at fort mac in 1874 discovered many gruesome relics leod in 1875
 and to which i was an eye of bygone tragedies one i remember witness the firm of i g baker
 co was the finding of the skeltons of some furnished all supplies to the mounted poor creatures who had been
 cruelly police including beef to furnish the beef murdered by indians a long way above needed a herd of cattle
 belonging to fort macleod on the oldman river also that firm was allowed to graze in the remains of several
 partly burned wagons porcupine hills west of fort macleod a were found not far from the spot stories cow was
 driven down on one occasion were told but with little or nothing to for slaughter and on cutting open the
 substantiate them that a party of immipaunch considerable coarse gold and grants or prospectors from montana were black sand was
 found in it no fraud on their way to edmonton they could be possible in the case as there travelled
 near the foothills of the mounwas no reason in those days to start a tains for fear of indians and
 had been gold rush and there were several men attacked by blackfeet under the chief engaged in cutting up the
 animal who old sun and everyone killed and saw the gold taken from the paunch scalped the truth of this
 was never charles conrad at that time in charge proved but it was well known and often of the store
 at fort macleod had the an important post in the whiskey trade was fort gold on a plate on exhibition
 in his whoop up located just west of the present city window for a long time it was if i
 of lethbridge fold by the indians that old sun had upon them and exterminate the camp in his possession a
 scalp with the long but the blackfeet had been warned and hair of a woman in fact old sun when
 were prepared for them and to complete a very old man told me of it himself the discomfiture of the
 attacking party but would never say where it was the traders from montana had been supobtained plying the new magazine
 rifle to the blackfeet while the crees and assirii the traders from fort benton were boines had only the old
 fashioned h b mostly married to indian women accord co muskets or bows and arrows the ing to indian customs
 this was by pur result was a crushing defeat for the chasing the white man paying the father attackers who
 lost over 300 killed while of the girl a horse a gun or often a the losses of the blackfeet
 were trivial gallon or two of diluted whiskey the indians looked upon these marriages as in 1871 a cold blooded
 killing of binding but it was otherwise with the indians occurred near the cypress hills traders who would turn their
 wives back a party of whiskey traders had a horse stolen from their camp and determined to camp on getting
 tired of them and then these men crossed over into purchase another i knew of one trader on revenge who
 made boast of his last wife being montana and gathered together a gang number thirty one of desperadoes comprising whiskey
 traders wolfers and outlaws of every the last great battle between the description returning north they sur crees and assiniboines
 against the prised a camp of indians and murdered bloods and blackfeet was fought not far in cold blood at
 least fifty men women from whoop up in 1870 the blackleet and children it was crimes like these had been
 much reduced in number by the knowledge of which became in time the smallpox the previous year and the widely
 circulated that led up to the crees and assiniboines combining organization of the north west mounted thought it a good
 opportunity to descend police when old friends meet morley a band of stonies returned today from hunting the band consisted
 of eight lodges with chief chiniki while travelling between sheep creek and high river last monday one of their number
 named hector was behind the party some distance and was accosted by some bloods who wanted him to smoke with
 them this he refused to do as it necessitated him putting down his rifle upon this the bloods started firing
 and he returned their fire 13 times he was then shot in the thigh and being unable to fight any
 longer he rode after the band the same evening after the stonies had camped the bloods again came upon them
 and firing shot a stony named susy in the breast the stonies returning their fire drove them off both the
 stonies are doing well the stonies are very reticent about stating the number of bloods they wounded they admit having
 killed one but will say nothing further yet it is thought they have killed or wounded more as they are
 remarkably good shots there is no doubt that the bloods started the quarrel as the stony indians are not quarrelsome
 and being partly civilized understand that any complaint they make to the police will always be in uired into lethbridge

 interested in the lion to preserve her past while much of it is still within recall finer details of alberta
 history they would not care to read thick history books or travel many miles off the british columbia centennial beaten
 path to see some historic site but it is equally true that the tourist our western neighbor appears to be

 have been and also to be entertained alberta s published a number of which are rehistory could play an important
 part in viewed on the next page and countless fulfilling both of these desires magazine and newspaper articles have been
 appearing quite regularly alberta s history is something which is exclusively ours and cannot be copied this province with its
 golden jubilee or imitated elsewhere thus it can be just recently packed away has many different this province had the

 enterprising as british columbia is in 1958 our congratulations go to our history may be a serious field but elder
 neighbor too often the publishing of dry tedious tomes has left the impression that the factual past is drab and
 colorless this is not true properly handled history can be intriguing and exciting it can be instructive but at the
