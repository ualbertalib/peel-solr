 2 today we honour the memory of lord louis earl mountbatten 0:mount 0:batten of burma killed in a cold cruel 
 calculated act of violence claiming as well three other innocent lives his grandson nicholas the dowager lady brabourne mother inlaw 
 0:mother 0:in 0:law of our colonel in chief and a 15 year old farm boy from the villiage of sligo 
 and severely injuring our colonel in chief lady patricia her husband lord john brabourne and their son timothy twin brother 
 of nicholas the youngest of her seven children i was advised last night that they are recovering in the same 
 room and that she had requested a patricia attend the funeral of nicholas lieutenant colonel dick macintosh her aide de 
 camp when she visited her regiment in 1976 will be doing so tomorrow lord mountbatten will be remembered as one 
 of our greatest sailors statesmen world leaders indeed a soldier as colonel of the life guards and as an honourary 
 member of this regiment 0:regi 0:ment a man whose major goal was to help his fellow man achieve freedom and 
 happiness one which he achieved in great measure in all he personally undertook many distinguished 0:distin 0:guished persons will and 
 have extolled these great qualities and his distinguished outstanding career and do so much better than i could i would 
 like to mention however those qualities which gave great strength and sense of family to our regiment he accompanied 0:accom 
 0:panied our colonel in chief to canada three times after she assumed her appointment first in 1974 primarily to visit 
 the home station and to inspect her first battalion as they trooped the colours i recall however in his uniform 
 as admiral of the fleet he proudly snapped dozens of pictures of her as she carried on her official duties 
 on that occasion he also visited pearson college in victoria one of the united world colleges of which he was 
 then president and founder in 1976 when she visited her second battalion those memorable 0:memor 0:able celebrations of the 25th 
 anniversary of the battle of kapyoung and in 1977 at mcmahon stadium in a magnificent ceremony she presented new colours 
 to her first battalion on behalf of her majesty the queen and again lord louis resplendent 0:res 0:plendent in his 
 uniform as colonel of the life guards happily and proudly watched as his daughter carried on as presiding officer i 
 had the honour of being with them and travelling with them through most of these visits and i am reminded 
 of many great things which stand out but most of all i am reminded of some very simple but splendid 
 qualities in such a great man his immense love for all his family and great pride in their achievements the 
 pride of a father when as honourable aidede camp 0:aide 0:de 0:camp and for the occasion junior to lady patricia 
 he remained quietly in the background again capturing pictures as she inspected and spoke to and mixed with her patricias 
 i also know he showed these pictures to all who visited him and to the royal family he also understood 
 the regimental system well as any good family man must do those close family ties the respect and help for 
 one another the ceremony and the relaxation he was an honourary patricia and was presented his regimental tie by his 
 daughter he wore the patricia tie with great pride in fact a pride that showed his love for his family 
 and this regiment the fact that in his funeral service today in london the canadian troops that participated commanded by 
 captain john miles came from this regiment by his express wish and marched with his own regiment the life guards 
 further emphasize his love of family and his friendship with his fellow patricias he was a man who appeared to 
 be completely at peace with himself although continually striving to help others in fact in an interview not too long 
 ago he was asked about death and replied to the effect that he had been through two wars life had 
 been full and happy and that death held no fear in fact i suspect this attitude which is of the 
 highest christian ideal inspired him all his life and was exemplified when his flagship the kelly was sunk and he 
 was the last man to leave an example of his many great acts of leadership fellow patricias and friends everyone 
 knows the world has lost a great man a rare man but we also know and grieve that we have 
 lost a fellow patricia a member of our family whom we respected and admired and who inspired us all with 
 his selfless devotion and dedication to his sovereign his country and the world we will remember this great patricia

 5 historical note brigadier general r t pelly cb cmg dso major l e grimshaw each year the editor attempts 
 to include an article relating to some aspect of regimental history this year the patrician focuses on brigadier general pelly 
 an original officer and our third commanding officer although one of the less well known of the early commanding officers 
 he had a very distinguished 0:dis 0:tinguished war record and was one of the most decorated patricias this is his 
 story raymond theodore pelly was born 30 july 1881 the son of canaon r p pelly vicar of great malvern 
 he enlisted in the worcester yeomanry regular army 20 december 1899 and served in the south african war participating in 
 operations in orange river colony and the transvaal between may and december 0:de 0:cember 1900 for this service he was 
 awarded the queen s south africa medal with four clasps he was commissioned as second lieutenant in the loyal north 
 lancashire regiment on 24 july 1901 and served until 22 november 1912 when he retired as a captain and was 
 placed on the special reserve he immigrated to canada in 1913 and on the outbreak of the world war he 
 responded to the call for volunteers joining ppcli 12 august 1914 where he was appointed major commanding no 1 company 
 following the battle of frezenberg he was appointed temporary 0:tem 0:porary lieutenant colonel and commanding officer on 14 may 1915 
 to him in this capacity fell the task of rebuilding the regiment in the words of the regimental history the 
 main achievement of the summer of 1915 was the renaissance of the regiment under col pelly to whose energy and 
 initiative was mainly attributed the success of the reorganization also during this period ltcol pelly commanded the regiment on the 
 somme at frise during the regiment s last engagements 0:engage 0:ments as part of the british 80th brigade and he 
 subsequently brought the regiment to the newly formed 3rd canadian division 0:divi 0:sion for his activities during this period of 
 command ltcol pelly was mentioned in dispatches for the first of seven such occasions and awarded the distinguished service order 
 for services rendered in connection with military operations in this field 
 6 on 15 december 1915 ltcol pelly was posted away for seven months to command the bth bn the royal 
 irish rifles during which time he fought in the early battles of the somme and was again mentioned in dispatches 
 following the death of ltcol buller ltcol pelly returned to command ppcli on 2 august 1916 just prior to the 
 autumn battles on the somme he commanded the regiment throughout the somme battles of 1916 including the action at fabeck 
 graben trench near courcelette and was again mentioned in dispatches having again handed over command on 31 october 1916 ltcol 
 pelly enjoyed a short respite from action while serving as an instructor at the school for commanding officers at aldershot 
 0:alder 0:shot england the respite was short lived and he returned to france in may 1917 as temporary brigadier general 
 commanding 91st infantry brigade in the 7th british division after the hard fighting at bullecourt and passchendaele brigadier general pelly 
 took his brigade to italy in november 1917 when 7th division was transferred to xiv british corps on the italian 
 front there his brigade took part in the battle of the asiago plateau in june 1918 this battle perhaps the 
 most important one fought in the italian theatre was a turning point the last great austro hungarian attack was defeated 
 and thrown back paving the way for the successful italian counter offensive later in the year and hastening the collapse 
 of the already crumbling austro hungarian monarchy to commemorate this great italian victory general montuori commander of the italian 6th 
 army which included the british and french allied forces presented a specially struck medal in silver to regimental officers and 
 gold to senior commanders one of which was awarded to brigadier general pelly brigadier general pelly led his brigade through 
 the battles which culminated in the final defeat of the austrians on the river piave in october and november 1918 
 here he was awarded the distinguished service order for the second time for gallantry and conspicuous good service he handled 
 the left brigade of the 7th division at the crossing of the piave 27 october 1918 with marked success this 
 brigade particularly 0:particu 0:larly distinguished itself on the monticano particularly in the capture of cimetta when stubborn resistance was encountered 
 0:encoun 0:tered brig gen pelly showed great judgement and coolness in personally superintending the final capture of this village from 
 the banks of the monticano when they were under heavy artillery and machine gun fire the whole time throughout the 
 whole operation he set a fine example to his brigade in addition to four more mentions in dispatches brigadier general 
 pelly was subsequently appointed a companion of the most honourable order of the bath and a companion of the most 
 distinguished order of st michael and st george in 1919 both for his services in italy as well he was 
 awarded the italian croci di guerra and in 1927 was appointed a commander 0:comman 0:der of the italian order of 
 st maurice and st lazarus there are two most interesting and notable features about brigadier general pelly s service in 
 the great war the first is that with the exception of the first four months of the war in canada 
 and enroute to france and later seven months instructional 0:instruc 0:tional duty in england he was in command of troops 
 at either company battalion or brigade level for the entire remaining 40 months of the war moreover he was never 
 wounded the second feature is that in spite of his most capable and distinguished 0:dis 0:tinguished service he had little 
 status in the post war regular army after demobilization having left the british regular army in 1912 and having been 
 assigned to the special reserve as a captain he retained that status throughout the war for example 0:ex 0:ample for 
 the latter half of 1917 his official status was captain brevet major temporary brigadier general and he was not promoted 
 to the substantive rank of major until march 1918 thus upon demobilization in march 1919 he relinquished 0:relin 0:quished the 
 temporary rank of brigadier general and rejoined the loyal north lancashire regiment as acting lieutenant colonel commanding their 12th pioneer 
 battalion he retired from the regular army in 1922 and was granted the honourary rank of brigadier general and ceased 
 to belong to the regular army reserve of officers in 1936 in 1942 brigadier general pelly was appointed a military 
 knight of windsor and resided at windsor castle until his death on 28 june 1952 for king and empire

 unit was withdrawn from the operation and after hurried maintenance and a few days leave we were off for waincon

 able to learn in comfort with little danger of casualties due to bitter cold some of the new soldiers found 
 that living in an arctic tent and eating irps for three weeks can be hard on the system the lesson 
 was relearned for some that rations have to be carefully prepared to avoid dehydration or hypoglycemia the local rabbit population

 some members of the unit refused to believe that there were in fact no members of the fair sex and 
 at least one group headed for the dance at rainbow junction 0:junc 0:tion the first operation was shackle which was 
 a sweep of the range impact areas for unexploded shells a large number of duds were amassed and disposed of 
 in a safe manner this exercise is done every year to keep the training area safe for the large number 
 of troops moving through it particularly at night the week of the 21st of may was taken up with company 
 field firing the field firing exercises started at section level and progressed through platoon to company live fire exercises 0:exer 
 0:cises the exercises used live ammunition against man sized targets and tanks which could be dragged by cables to simulate 
 movement throughout there were hidden charges of explosives to lend an air of realism to the exercise at the end 
 of the exercise the scene was like a john wayne war movie as riflemen raked trenches with weapon bursts and 
 hurled grenades onto the enemy position it said much for the training of the companies that any injuries were minor 
 and usually due to shrapnel from grenades which missed their mark and rolled back down towards the grenadier a welcome 
 break came on the 30th of may when the unit stood down for a sports day the olympic flame was 
 lit by private withers who displayed great form in his sprint around the track a company walked away with most 
 of the gold medals while the remaining companies laid new plans for a comeback in the fall meet on the 
 3rd of june exercise starlight madness commenced 0:com 0:menced this exercise had as a principle aim the exercise of the 
 medical system in their ability to evacuate and treat battle casualties each battle resulted in a grisly trail of wounded

 facilities in the past year cabc has hosted visitors from the usa great britain australia new zealand indonesia foreign students 
 from clfsc and military at tachees of foreign governments not to mention innumerable staff officers from our respective hqs another 
 point of attraction at cabc is the canadian airbor forces museum many older patricias who have served in the airborne 
 role would certainly find this museum second to none in depicting the history of canada s airborne the museum is 
 located in the old junior ranks canteen building in hamilton gault barracks within griesbach and is open sunday to wednesday 
 inclusive with special tours provided on request in conclusion as the readers may well detect the ppcli representatives at cabc 
 are kept quite busy the employment here is challenging varied and interesting all patricians serving at cabc extend warm greetings

 79 the royal green jackets royal green jacket news 1978 ist battalion sun sea the exotic east lazy days spent 
 soaking up the warmth these were the thoughts that filled all our minds prior to departure for hong kong after 
 several years of turbulence 0:tur 0:bulence and unaccompanied tours around the world the battalion 0:bat 0:talion was to settle down 
 and enjoy a rest in the orient the battalion was to settle down and enjoy a rest in the orient 
 it was not to be the battalion s role in hong kong is varied and demanding our primary role and 
 the reason for which the hong kong taxpayer 0:tax 0:payer has to pay 75 of the cost of our presence 
 here is threefold to preserve the integrity of the hong kong border to assist the police if called upon in 
 maintaining order and to come to the aid of the civil authorities if required that commitment 0:com 0:mitment coupled with 
 the necessity to train for three types of warfare internal security conventional limited war and jungle operations has not lessened 
 over the years despite an ever decreasing garrison this has meant that the battalion has been at full stretch throughout 
 the year fulfilling our commitments has not been helped by the establishment reduction to 650 for an infantry battalion to 
 which we reorganized for a move to hong kong the picture however is never as gloomy as it may sound 
 there has been time for much varied training during the year as the activities of the companies will show our 
 role of preserving the integrity of the border is achieved by spending thirteen weeks each year stationed along the land 
 frontier that joins the new territories of hong kong to mainland communist china this involves a minimum of three companies 
 at a time manning observation posts and mounting anti illegal immigrant patrols the importance of the first task cannot be 
 overstated since the ops provide the only overt source of intelligence the west has on the activities of the chinese 
 communist army and sharp eyed riflemem well trained over the last few years in this type of work have produced 
 a steady stream of useful information the patrolling is however our major task and the battalion produces between 0:bet 0:ween 
 40 and 50 ambush patrols nightly along the 26 kilometres of the land frontier their targets being communist chinese fleeing 
 from red china into an already dangerously overcrowded 0:over 0:crowded hong kong once caught the illegal immigrants are returned to 
 china daily infantry battalions tend over here to be judged on their performance 0:per 0:formance on the border and it 
 was with some satisfaction that on the recently completed tour we established an all time record for the number of 
 illegal immigrants caught during a single tour 2nd battalion the last edition of the newsletter left us training hard for 
 our four month tour in south armagh the battalion deployed there in early december 1977 to the now familiar sounding 
 names of crossmaglen forkhill newry newtonhamilton and bessbrook it was not long before the opposition got wind of our presence 
 and tried to make their point by trying to blow up a patrol of b company s near crossmaglen we 
 celebrated christmas as best we could however we were delighted to see a party from the band who had come 
 to cheer us up successfully and also our old friend from gibraltar 0:gibral 0:tar father ronnie brown the advent of 
 the new year passed almost unnoticed and arctic weather descended on south armagh 0:ar 0:magh february was a black month 
 with the death of the commanding officer lieutenant colonel lain corden lloyd and rifleman nicholas smith it is difficult to 
 put into words what colonel lain s death meant to us all and perhaps the most fitting tribute was a 
 quotation which appeared in the battalion 0:bat 0:talion magazine public eye the true test of excellence is not immediate success 
 but durable fame in the true tradition of riflemen adversity did not get everyone down and life proceeded with vigour 
 as colonel laian would have wished we eventually shook off the mud and snow of ulster in early april and 
 after several alarms and excursions flew back to england the new commanding officer lieutenant colonel peter treneer michell was ready 
 and waiting in tidworth where a hectic week of parties and boards of officers was spent before the battalion scattered 
 to the four winds for a month s well earned leave after leave in august the battalion took over duties 
 as spearhead battalion papers were scanned anxiously each day but none of the nap selections came up although the possibility 
 of joining owens africa corps kept some people hoping the indian summer heralded the start of the ftx season and 
 the battalion took part in 8 field force ftx the whole battalion 0:bat 0:talion dug in on stanford training area 
 including battalion headquarters with a little engineer help meanwhile an advance 0:ad 0:vance party moved to cyprus ho set up

 being written a and b companies 0:com 0:panies and elements of hq company are enjoying the sun sea and pleasures 
 of windsurfing interspersed with forays onto the training area mid november will see the battalion home again and after yet 
 another ftx hopefully christmas at home for the first time in 15 years 
 80 3rd battalion any thoughts in october 1977 that the battalion could anticipate 0:an 0:ticipate a quiet christmas at home 
 were rudely disturbed in early november by rumours of an impending strike by the firemen with fourteen green goddess fire 
 engines on the square at caterham we became increasingly aware that we might be involved after a series of hasty 
 conferences and reconnaissances on remembrance sunday the companies moved into their service fire stations that night ready for the next 
 day s inferno with a company at croydon r and subsequently 0:sub 0:sequently b company at camberwell and dulwich and 
 s company 0:com 0:pany at sutton and bromley were were responsible for providing fire cover for nearly four million people 
 the strike soon proved to be more than a five day wonder and as the weeks slipped by our original 
 plans for public duties christmas 0:christ 0:mas embarkation leave and northern ireland training were all consigned to the waste paper 
 basket fire fighting proved to be exciting and in many ways sheer good fun it certainly exercised 0:exer 0:cised the 
 sound military qualities of speed control and good team work one bonus was operating in one of our own recruiting 
 areas where many riflemen had a fund of local knowledge we received the most heart warming response from the locals 
 including many gifts over the christmas period at last after dealing with nearly 500 fires the battalion returned to caterham 
 in early january throughout the strie we had been providing our share of guards for public duties a load which 
 fell mainly on b company and for the final queen s guard r company the battalion then departed on three 
 weeks well earned block leave before turning its attention to ulster we had been very much a belfast battalion and 
 rusty at that with our last tour in 1975 so the prospect of the more rural areas of londonderry and 
 tyrone was new and exciting after a short weekend the battalion moved to lydd in kent to start practical training 
 we had just over ten days to achieve the operational standards required on arrival in the province the battalion is 
 responsible for some 200 square miles east and south of the city of londonderry including nearly 20 miles of the 
 border with the republic much of our time is spent in routine patrolling or static guard tasks only occasionally do 
 major operations or terrorist incidents provide the longawaited 0:long 0:awaited excitement on several occasions terrorists have come across the border 
 and ambushed patrols or shot up check points in one case with an m6o machine gun bomb teams from across 
 the river attacked local commercial and communications targets on the success side our searches have recovered several weapons and bomb 
 making equipment on three occasions our patrols have engaged or arrested gunmen moving into position which is particularly satisfying from 
 wet and windy londonderry we wish all our friends the best for 1979 general sir edwin bramall cgb obe mc

 sixth 0:six 0:th battalion the royal australian regiment 6 rar on the routine search contacted an enemy force of four 
 battalions the action that ensued became known as the battle of long tan and was the heaviest engagement of australian 
 forces in vietnam since the australian commitment began in 1962 today the battle is commemorated annually by the royal australian 
 regiment the australian area of operations in south vietnam was centered on phuc tuy province a rice and rubber growing 
 area approximately 40 x 50 kilometres in size located to the southeast of saigon and bordering the south china sea 
 in 1966 the province was an important enemy resupply and staging area in the early months of 1966 the australians 
 began to establish a permanent defended base area at nui dat which was to become the home of the ist 
 australian task force 1 atf by august the task force at nui dat comprised a 5 rar and 6 rar

 august the viet cong mounted a heavy mortar rocket and artillery attack on nui dat effective interdiction and counter battery 
 missions were fired in retaliation and 6 rar then involved in company operations close to the base area was ordered 
 to locate and destroy the enemy force responsible prior to this attack there had been little intelligence indicating that an 
 enemy force of significant size had moved into the province b company 6 rar b 6 rar quickly moved to 
 the general area of the enemy firing points some two kilometres east of the base area and discovered hastily abandoned 
 positions the company spent the remainder of the day and the morning of 18 august investigating the numerous trails leading 
 from the enemy position but without success at mid day co 6rar ordered d 6 rar to relieve b 6 
 rar and continue the search further east after liaising with b 6 rar in place d 6 rar with a 
 strength of 108 continued to follow the direction of the enemy withdrawal 0:with 0:drawal by 1530 hours the company had 
 entered the long tan rubber plantation and was deployed on a broad front with two platoons up 11 platoon on 
 the right 10 platoon on the left with company hq and 12 platoon in the centre rear in this formation 
 the company covered a frontage of 400 metres and a simiiar distance in depth at 1540 hours the forward platoons 
 contacted 6 8 enemy who after a brief exchange of fire fled further into the rubber in the general direction 
 of the company s movement a dead viet cong soldier was found as the company followed up some minutes later 
 11 platoon contacted an estimated enemy platoon and immediately called for artillery fire support 0:sup 0:port the battle quickly developed 
 and 11 platoon reported that they were taking heavy small arms fire and were being attacked 0:at 0:tacked from two 
 sides as it was obvious that the platoon had struck a large enemy force oc d 6 rar ordered them 
 to withdraw 0:with 0:draw and attempted to move forward with 12 platoon to cover their withdrawal however this movement was 
 stopped by heavy fire coming through and over the 11 platoon area and accurate enemy mortar fire despite effective australian 
 artillery fire the enemy continued 0:contin 0:ued to press his attacks on 11 platoon whose position had become 0:be 0:come 
 desparate on the death of the platoon commander the platoon sergeant reported that they were almost surrounded were low on 
 ammunition and that intense enemy fire had inflicted 0:in 0:flicted heavy casualties and pinned them down 10 platoon not under 
 fire was ordered to relieve 11 platoon they approached to within 100 metres of the 11 platoon area but were 
 met by heavy machine gun and mortar fire and subsequently 0:sub 0:sequently by infantry attacks realizing that 10 platoon could 
 not move forward and faced a similar situation to 11 platoon oc d 6 rar ordered them to withdraw and 
 concentrate with company hq and 12 platoon communications were lost with 11 platoon after they reported that viet cong were 
 all around them estimates of the size of the enemy force had grown to a battalion plus meanwhile back in 
 the base area co 6 rar acted on the increasingly 0:in 0:creasingly alarming reports flowing back from the beleaguered company 
 a 6 rar mounted in apc was dispatched 0:dispat 0:ched at best speed to join the battle and b 6 
 rar still moving back to the base area from its earlier patrol was ordered to move to the d 6 
 rar area by this time the entire task force artillery was firing continuously 0:con 0:tinuously in response to calls for 
 defensive fire from d 6 rar usaf strike aircraft attempting to assist the embattled company 0:com 0:pany were hampered by 
 poor visibility due to a heavy monsoon rain storm which had begun at the time of first contact and consequently 
 reduced visibility at ground levelt o 30 metres however the critical d 6 rar ammunition shortage was alleviated by the 
 timely arrival of a raaf helicopter which dropped the resupply through the canopy into the company area 
 82 sergeant r s buick mm acting platoon commander of 11 platoon attending a wounded member of the platoon the 
 soldier believed killed during the initial contact had lain on the battlefield during the night and was discovered during the 
 clearance operation at dawn the following morning a member of the d 6 rar looking through the rubber at the 
 route taken by the survivors of 11 platoon when they fought their way back to the company position 
 83 by 1810 hours after heavy fighting company hq 10 and 12 platoons had managed to concentrate in a tight 
 defensive position and cover the withdrawal of the survivors of 11 platoon the enemy continued to rake the area with 
 intense small arms fire and mounted successive attacks from three different directions only the effectiveness of close artillery defensive fire 
 and accurate small arms fire from d 6 rar kept the enemy from over running the position at 1850 hours 
 the apc mounted a 6 rar while rapidly closing with the scene of battle contacted an estimated threecompany 0:three 0:company 
 enemy envelopment force which was moving to assault the d 6 rar position from the rear deploying directly from the 
 line of march a 6 rar attacked the enemy force from a flank and shattered it causing heavy casualties the 
 enemy swiftly broke contact and withdrew by 1910 hours both a and b 6 rar had married up with d 
 6 rar and co 6 rar had arrived to take control of the battle during the hours of darkness casualties 
 were evacuated and preparations were made to pursue the enemy force the following day brigadier o d jackson dso obe 
 commander 1 atf talking with members of d company on the morning of 19 august 1966 at first light on 
 19 august 6 rar with d 5 rar followed the enemy withdrawal routes to the limits of artillery range but 
 without significant contact a concurrent battlefield clearance operation yielded 3 enemy prisoners and large quantities of equipment weapons and ammunition 
 the rubber plantation was strewn with the bodies of 245 enemy dead and evidence indicating the evacuation of a further 
 350 casualties 6 rar losses were comparitively light with 18 killed and 21 wounded the majority of these were members 
 of 11 platoon captured documents and subsequent interrogation of prisoners revealed that it was the enemy intention to attack and 
 annihilate the australian force at nui dat before they became too established and thus open the way for eventual viet 
 cong dominance of the province for the operation the enemy had allotted 275 regiment of three battalions and d 445 
 battalion in total a force of 2 000 men only the resolute defence of d 6 rar against the vastly 
 superior and determined enemy force had prevented a surprise attack on the 1 atf base area there were many acts 
 of conspicuous courage during the bloody three hour battle and these were subsequently recognized by the award of an mc 
 dcn mbe mm and 5 mids to members of the company perhaps the greatest honour was the award of the 
 us presidential unit citation which is proudly worn by its members today so decisive was the victory that it was 
 two years before the enemy again attempted such a large scale operation within the australian area the battle of long 
 tan established the australian force in south vietnam and paved the way for further 0:fur 0:ther successes in subsequent years 
 the battle is a significant high point in the history of the royal australian regiment

 87 nato small arms arctic test major l e grimshaw b company 1 ppcli provided the bulk of the organization 
 for the nato small arms arctic test conducted at shilo manitoba in january and february under the direction of the 
 nato small arms test co ordination commission nsmatcc 0:nsmat 0:cc with a view to selecting another standard calibre of ammunition 
 0:am 0:munition and possibly a standard rifle and light machine gun shilo was selected as the test site because of 
 its predictably cold weather we were not disappointed temperatures ranging from 12 to 38 c with varying wind and occasional 
 0:oc 0:casional snow during the course of the test this test the main canadian effort in the series of nato 
 tests was conducted by b company who were backed up by forty gunners from 3 rcha in shilo who provided 
 most of the data collection group a group of armourers from various bases and units technical experts from dlaeem in 
 ndhq and the allied armourers 0:ar 0:mourers and instructors who accompanied the weapons together the organization involved 130 officers and 
 men from seven countries the weapons in the test were in two categories the rifle or individual weapon group consisting 
 of the german g 3 an inservice 0:in 0:service 7 62 mm weapon used as a control the us mi6ai 
 with a new 5 56 mm ammunition the dutch mn 1 french mas belgian fnc all 5 56 mm and 
 the british 4 85 mm weapon the light support weapon group consisted of the belgian mag 58 again a 7 
 62 mm control weapon the german 7 62 mm mg3e the belgian 5 56 mm minimi and the british 4 
 85 mm weapon each country s weapons were accompanied by an instructor and armourer who trained the canadian instructors and 
 armourers 0:ar 0:mourers on their weapon and then supervised canadian handling 0:han 0:dling initial planning for the test began in 
 july 1978 when i was tasked to conduct it unfortunately we were all in cyprus at the time and little 
 could be done however i was able to attend a nato demonstration and examine the procedures used at the main 
 test site at hammelburg germany during those visits the test design of the cold weather test was revised presented to 
 the nsmatcc and approved preparations did not begin in earnest until after the battalion rotated home in november the senior 
 data officers and chief armourer were sent to hammelburg to study the test methods and procedures while the company recce 
 party visited shilo and made detailed arrangements the cold weather test had to be as similar as possible to the 
 hammelburg test to provide maximum correlation between the results of the two accordingly the same ten weapons were tested although 
 only three of each wete used in addition before test firing could take place extensive modification and temporary re wiring 
 of the two shilo electrical target ranges was required to permit targets to be exposed individually over a wide arc 
 of fire rather than in the usual lanes in addition two moving target systems had to be designed and built 
 the cfb shilo staff tackled the task vigorously in december and the work was completed by the time the test 
 group arrived early in january after an initial setting up and training period the test itself was conducted in a 
 series of one week cycles each consisting of two days of training and zeroing followed by three days of firing 
 each group of three test weapons was fired by a different 0:dif 0:ferent team of shooters each cycle so that 
 each firing team tested each of the weapons of their category in a round robin program the job of programming 
 fell to the test controller captain niall warry royal green jackets our british exchange 0:ex 0:change officer his problem was 
 to ensure that the weapons were fired by different teams each week at various times of the day on three 
 ranges operating concurrently the job of delivering the right ammunition of which there were nine varieties in three calibres to 
 the right range at the right time fell to the cqms wo don ritthaler who also looked after the supply 
 of the mass of the stores equipment and spare parts the csm mwo tom reid not only carried out the 
 normal csm duties but also acted as the administrative officer for the test centre somehow he managed to look after 
 the reception despatch care and feeding of a large number of visitors and technical experts temporarily assigned to the organization 
 it is impossible to relate any anecdotes of amusing events which occurred during the tests unfortunately it simply was not 
 very funny on the firing point at 30 with a 10 mph wind invariably blowing into the faces of the 
 firers fortunately there were no untoward incidents except for a few minor frost injuries including mcpl brian steele who froze 
 the tip of his nose to the receiver of his weapon during firing practice there was a great deal more 
 to the tests than simply firing the weapons in the cold a staggering amount of data was collected from the 
 firing and handling tests to provide information 0:infor 0:mation on the hitting performance mechanical reliability and handling of the weapons 
 this was achieved by the data collection group under the control of major tom westran from dlaeem at ndhq and 
 who is also the deputy project manager of the new family of small arms nfsa project with the aid of 
 a computer storage unit lt keith harrison the chief data collector and sgt bob cameron the data nco with the 
 gunners of 3 rcha issued thousands of different forms which were filled in returned and validated checked and rechecked and 
 finally stored in the computer the collection 0:collec 0:tion of reliability and maintainability data as well as maintenance 0:main 0:tenance 
 of the weapons was done by the armourers under the control of cwo dan lyle of dlaeem the aim of 
 the hitting performance tests was to hit as many targets with as few rounds in the shortest time as possible 
 to encourage the firers a competition was devised within each of the weapon groups the most efficient killers who hit 
 the most targets with the least number of rounds over the course of the test were mcpl po judge with 
 the light support weapons and pte joe benoit with the individual weapons they were each awarded a trophy bearing examples 
 of all the types of test ammunition following the test the data was compiled in machine readable formats and submitted 
 together with the results of the other military and technical tests to several results analysis groups consistently the results of 
 the analysis will not be available until well after the test however the immediate 0:im 0:mediate results for the company 
 has been in the training benefits achieved through handling and firing a variety of new weapons on challenging ranges complete 
 with moving targets for the participants who were not firing there was the experience of planning setting up and executing 
 a function for which no one had been particularly trained again demonstrating 0:demon 0:strating the versatility of our troops epilogue 
 since the test i have freqnelty been asked which of the weapons was best of course i cannot tell because 
 the results are not only classified but we did not do any analysis as stated previously the best will be 
 determined through the analysis of the results of the nato tests the overall result will be determined through the following

 melting snow would lead to extensive flooding in the province of manitoba flooding would be aggravated by builtup 0:built 0:up 
 road and rail networks that would channel the water deeper and far wider than ever before in defence of the 
 floods several towns in the lower red river valley have constructed ring dikes around their perimeters 0:peri 0:meters these earthen 
 walls were built based on the levels of the devastating 1950 flood additional height was added to allow for the 
 waves created by the high winds it is not uncommon 0:un 0:common to hear of small craft warnings on the 
 flooded lands stockpiled beside all access roads is sufficient fill to close and ring the town in the event of 
 an emergency in addition to the major towns several farms religious colonies and small industrial complexes maintain their own ring

 detailed recces and issued orders for the execution of the tasks given the task force was responsible for dike patrol 
 and dike maintenance provision of emergency com munications to water resource personnel assistance in emergency resupply to water resource personnel 
 humani tarian assistance and emergency evacuation of military and civilian personne l in the event of a collapsed dike throughout 
 the operation the morale of the unit remained high civilian and military authorities all reflected an attitude that the men 
 of 2 ppcli were definitely required and were an asset contributing toward the defence against the floods this attitude was 
 well portrayed by all the media as a result individual 0:in 0:dividual soldiers maintained a high state of morale and 
 a strong sense of purpose co operation with the local civilian residents was excellent throughout each company took the opportunity 
 to concentrate 0:concen 0:trate their activities towards and to achieve objectives which included everything from band concerts and tours to 
 barbecues 0:bar 0:becues and apc rides these activities were instrumental in maintaining and greatly improving the image of the canadian 
 forces and in particular the ppcli repair and resupply throughout the exercise proceeded most favourably with limited exceptions all vehicles 
 and equipment remained serviceable exceptions were quickly addressed 0:ad 0:dressed by both first and second line maintenance organizations 0:organiza 0:tions 
 indeed the response of cfb winnipeg was excellent most sections were quick to switch to a 24 and 7 operation 
 resupply was effected without major incident due mainly to the availability of helicopters once the ring dikes were closed withdrawal

 may after 14 000 total mandays and 66 500 vehicle miles at a cost of 94 000 mother nature was 
 beaten and op bolster ended the task provided 2 ppcli with the opportunity to display organizational administrative and leadership abilities 
 and talents seldom seen or appreciated by the public or many members of the canadian forces who never see an 
 infantry battalion group deployed as it is intended compared to war it was a bit of a picnic nonetheless the 
 lessons learned and the procedures practised provided valuable experience soldiers gained a considerable satisfaction from their jobs having been given

 of the patrician the national president colonel w b s sutherland gave a summary of the review of the association 
 and the progress made up to november 1978 the tasks were allocated to branches and groups across the country and 
 feedback has been generating back to the president it is the president s intention to summarize this feedback at the 
 next annual general meeting at a time and location not yet announced many concrete ideas and suggestions have come forward 
 and in broad general terms a great deal of positive thinking has come out of this review largely due to 
 the effort and concern of branches all across the country a detached report of the findings and conclusions discussed at 
 the next annual general meeting will appear in the 1980 issue of the patrician branch activities the united kingdom branch 
 held its annual general meeting in london bth may 1979 in honour of the battle of frezenberg hosted by lieutenant 
 colonel dix cottingham with the guest of honour being our colonel in chief in late summer lcol e j jeff 
 williams assumed the presidency of the branch readers of the patrician will be saddened to learn of the death of 
 henry freese who passed away at his home in sussex in september of this year a member of both the 
 winnipeg 0:win 0:nipeg branch and the uk branch the montreal branch met on 17 march at a dinner held at 
 mobile command headquarters in montreal where serving members and branch members met to honour the regimental day brigadier rown coleman 
 continues as president of the montreal branch and brigadier jimmy delalanne presently serving as dominion grand president of the royal 
 canadian legion continues to keep patricias in touch with one another as he travels the length and breadth of canada 
 on legion business the ottawa branch confines to fluorish a most successful dinner was held 17th march with an excellent 
 representation from both serving and retired members of the regiment in the ottawa area lloyd swick became president of the 
 ottawa branch and joe berger s years of loyal service were honoured with a presentation the toronto branch held its 
 annual dinner in honour of the battle of frezenberg at the king edward hotel in toronto with representation from serving 
 members in the toronto area in attendance the winnipeg branch elected a new executive in the spring of the year 
 with andy schaen as president and sid mckay as vice president the branch indeed patricias everywhere were saddened at the 
 passing of dr e c corrigan in july of 1979 doc corrigan as he was known throughout the regiment served 
 as the unit medical officer during the italian campaign and was an active member of the winnipeg branch throughout the 
 years doc will be sadly missed by all members of the association the saskatchewan branch coniinues to grow and flourish 
 one of the highlights of branch activities during the past year was the visit of the branch to the second 
 battalion during training at camp dundurn near saskatoon an excellent luncheon 0:lun 0:cheon was provided by the battalion and branch 
 members were given an opportunity to meat with today s patricias and observe the equipment and training in which the 
 battallion are currently involved with the edmonton branch have had a worthwhile year with membership remaining fairly constant a great 
 deal of time and energy was put forth by a committee of the edmonton branch in connection with the association 
 review currently in progress members of the edmonton branch turned out in some strength to honour retired mwo g v 
 buck rogers in june of this year when he was honoured in edmonton by the canadian airborne regiment after having 
 served some 33 years with the regiment and the canadian airborne the calgary branch have met on a monthly basis 
 during the past year the september meeting saw some thirty seven members their wives and ladies turn out for a 
 short business meeting followed by a tour of the regimental museum at this meeting our new regimental major major lou 
 grimshaw was introduced to the branch and gave a brief report on the condition 0:con 0:dition and progress of our 
 colonel in chief the vancouver branch continues to flourish with an active membership and the branch gathered this year to 
 celebrate our regimental day on 17th march the secretary treasurer received an interesting note from walter mckay draycott one of 
 our world war i patricias walter celebrated his 96th birthday 0:birth 0:day with the observation that quote owing to old 
 age deterioration of bone in the pelvic area he would not be able to attend the dinner on 17th march 
 a double meaning for me in that i landed at portland maine enroute for canada on st patrick s day 
 1906 unquote signed your ancient scribe walter mackay draycott mr draycott continues to delight patricias everywhere with his personally sketched 
 annual christmas greetings the vancouver branch was saddened at the passing of al cummings in march of this year al 
 as well was noted for his artistic talent while serving with both first and second battalions 0:bat 0:talions of the 
 regiment the victorian branch have had a successful year meeting on a monthly basis in the warrant officers and sergeant 
 s mess at work point barracks during 1979 following a short business meeting a number of interesting speakers have addressed 
 0:ad 0:dressed the members on a wide variety of topics a most useful suggestion which came from the victoria branch 
 is the publishing of an association directory by branches enabling old friends to help keep in touch as addresses change 
 or a helpful method of contacting patricias in a particular branch when a member visits that branch s location it 
 is hoped to have the first issue of this directory in the hands of branches by the end of this 
 year thus another year comes to a close a year marked by tragedy for the regimental family in the loss 
 sustained by our colonel in chief and her family got strengthened by the concern 0:con 0:cern expressed by every branch 
 and heartened by the progress being made by lady patricia lord brabourne and their son timothy and it is the 
 earnest hope of all members of the regimental family that our beloved colonel in chief and her family will continue 
 towards full recovery and we look forward to their presence once again within our midst when health and strength permit
