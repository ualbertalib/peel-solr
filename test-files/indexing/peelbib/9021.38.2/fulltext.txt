 4 00 per copy hell ain t a mile off the journals of happy jack by michael klassen mexico and
 south of the rio grande into old mexico riding became happy s sole profession observed warren fulton a local r
 ancher 4 and his life on the range during the zenith of the american wild west has generated dozens of
 unverified rumours by various accounts happy jack was everything from a texas ranger to an outlaw before heading north to
 alberta in any case by the time happy jack arrived on the red deer his propensity for raising hell his
 drinking and above all his gruff manner with the rest of humanity were well established trademarks w i 1 app
 jack jackson about 1915 the author a graduate of the university of alberta with a ba in anthropology has been
 a visitor services supervisor at writing on stone provincial park a freelance writer and researcher he is presently involved in
 the production of a documentary film on the life of happy jack jackson 1925 june 30 not a human here
 frr 45 days the ground the people the jugs and bottles all dam dry the badlands along the red deer
 river surrounded by endless miles of d ry prairies still hide the weathered cabins of the mexico ranch now long
 abandoned the mexico was once the home of a badlands cowboy named hansel gordon happy jack jackson from his arrival
 in alberta in 1903 until his death in 1942 at the age of 80 jackson spent nearly 40 years on
 the mexico raising cattle and raising hell hell ain t a mile off is how happy jack seemed to view
 his life and the land he chose to live in and rarely a day went by that jackson didn t
 record his derisive opinions on everything from the weather to politics on the pages of dr chase s almanac largely
 due to this journal the legacy of this gruff bachelor lives on in local folklore through jackson tall tales faded
 memories and a cryptic journal have created a unique and unusual record of part of alberta s history the way
 in which happy jack is perceived today and a lso the way happy jack saw himself often differs from the
 perceptions of those who knew him these differing views make the story of happy jack an intriguing popular histoiy 1
 ocal and personal reactions to an era and a character his story can be told best by his own journal
 and with the help of the words of those who remember him he legends about happy jack r each as
 far back as his birth on september 26 1861 the son of a north carolina gentleman 2 and as the
 legends go a nephew of stonewall jackson 3 early in his life his family left the devastation of the civil
 war striking west through arkansas to texas soon afterward jackson began working on the ranches of the southwest following he
 cattle tr ail to kansas oklahoma arizona new happy jack came to alberta in 1903 as a rider involve a
 generous component of invention 0 accompanying a shipment of cattle from texas 5 not so difficult to understand considering the
 cirbut happy jack motives for leaving his home cumstances of jackson s life in the stark solitude are as mysterious
 as his past a commonly told of the deadlodge canyon badlands stor y suggests he was spurned by a woman
 and headed north out of lovesickness on the other 1909 aug 17 crossed cattle hand several acquaintances wer e led
 to believe 18 buck the kid was here 23 hot as hell every day he left behind a wife and
 children 6 sept 5 still mosquitoes plenty his real reason for leaving was probably more oct 14 bleu heifer had

 were drifting north in great numbers 7 to happy jack the red deer country the oral history perspective of happy
 jack s must have seemed like the last refuge of the wide life reflects a different somewhat nostalgic view open
 range few people who knew happy jack or lived during not long after arriving in alberta jackson hir ed his
 era have read much of his journal and their on as foreman with the newly established mexico impressions are mostly
 based on their own cx ranch this ranch was owned by the so called periences and memories they remember a
 cha lord beresford a british nobleman whom racter whose gruff sense of humour frightened happy jack had appar ently known
 in mexico many people someone who said a lot of things where beresford had owned another ranch not meant to
 be taken seriously maintaining his early in 1906 beresford was killed in a north independence until his death happy jack
 was a dakota train wreck on his way to chicago 9 and loner whose three commandments were beresford s huge
 lease reverted back to the don t lie pay your bills and mind your own government happy jack retained 160
 acres and business 2 the ranch buildings by filing for a homestead entry despite his anti social exterior many consiearly
 in 1908 but the mexico ranch under jack dered happy jack a friend and he is remembered son never grew
 larger than a few quarter sections for numerous acts of kindness and generosity ‘ happy jack lived alone on the
 mexico for the next and without exception recollections of happy 34 years jack are infused with respect according to fulton

 e represented a diffeent era and there was something about him you respected and if you january 1 1909 is
 the earliest entry in the diary didn t even like him you still respected him happy jack kept in dr
 chase s almanac al there was things different about him and about his cattle i ve been around cattle ever
 since i though often recording no more than the weather was born but i never gone out to get cattle
 jackson used this journal to complain loudly about and gather cattle like his i r emember coming the state of
 the world he lived in reading happy across these cattle on a flat west of his one time jack s
 journal gives the impression that he was and they just jumped up and ran like quail flying a cantankerous recluse
 whose only true friend was and suddenly they just disappeared i couldn t the bottle and this impression has inspired
 num figure out where these cattle had gone but they erous stories about the man often these stories had actually
 gone into these thick bullberry the mexico ranch on the red deer river seen here in 1936 was the home
 of happy jack jackson the building at left contained his bedroom while the other was his kitchen and dining area
 bushes and they were standing there just as 17 106 in the shade quiet as mice i rode right by
 and i could see 18 pretty close to hell them in there but they just never moved those 24 no
 need of elevators for grain cattle had something passed down to them this year there was an ingredient there of
 survival that i never saw in our cattle and the same thing loin the north side lof the red deer
 that was kinda applied to happy jack he had qualities a d ry spot driest spot in the whole country
 right that i think set him apart from everybody else there explains fulton 5 many settlers were he had qualities
 that was just a little different warned not to even attempt growing a crop the and you just knew you
 could go so far with this propaganda of the pro homesteading lobby was fellow otherwise you d be not welcome
 there ‘ effective however and much of the prairie happy jack arrived in the red deer country at north of
 the red deer quickly fell victim to the a time when nothing but a few ranches were oper plough happy
 jack had his own thoughts on the ating in the area and his only neighbours were wisdom of cultivating the
 land amund the mexico the cowboys riding for these outfits the isola as arthur brook recalls tion of the range
 was not about to last for long the revised dominon lands act of 1908 made he d conic along and
 pr obably we was breaking thousands of prairie acres available for home up the prairie sod and he d say
 you should steading and soon the drylands around the mex never turn the grass upside down in this country you
 re just spoiling it i ll be here when ico were swarming with homesteaders all at all the rest of
 youse have moved out and it tempting to farm in a land pretty close to hell worked hat way too
 happy jack i don t think 1910 june 11 god dam dry he was against anyone andl i think he
 helped july 9 god knows directs all things homesteaders more than any other one person for the best amen dry
 dry dam but he understood we was making a dry mistake 7 in the period from 1906 to 1911 the
 census for 25 brooks family was down the region which included the mexico recorded a phenomenal population increase growing from
 in 1912 arthur brook left england and joined 283 riders to 13 170 homesteaders 8 by 1918 his family who
 had homesteaded near the mexico nearly every quarter section of land in jackson s the year previously the brook family
 was among vicinity had been homesteaded an area which happy jack s closest neighbours during the only ten years previously
 had been home to homesteading period and their presence intronothing but cows and coyotes duced happy jack to a new
 sense of community as arthur brook remembers 1911 may i rivett josh goodfellow was christmas 1912 my mother cooked christmas
 here dinner at home and she packed it all and we 8 finished oats plowed garden walked down to happy
 s and had dinner with 13 rain dug post holes him hie didn t know we was coming we just
 14 many blisters walked in with a dinner all ready cooked 27 hard work every day oh lord happy said
 it was the first christmas in his life he d been sober the interests of ranchers sheepherders and in local
 folklore happy jack is not often piefarmers had often been in conflict throughout the tured as gregarious nor is he
 pictured as sober settling of western north america wooleys often with only cows for company his bottles of destroyed the
 grass nesters broke and fenced white horse whiskey must have consoled jackson the land and when they crowded in on
 the as he waited for something to happen according ranchers it inevitably created friction resentment to lois valli and sometimes
 even violence 9 happy jack had i t was very well known that happy jack drank seen open ranch country
 homesteaded four times a great deal at times and who could blame him before he came to the red deer
 and he claimed he lived like a coyote or worse though i think there were times in the south when
 his job was he did it because he chose to happy jack was to run them off the range 2
 there on his own quite a bit you know i think he drank from pure loneliness 1912 jan 7 hall
 family was down although they admit that his journal gives the 12 farmer took cow away june 25 mud stone

 that he was not an al july 14 dunbar family was down coholic and that his binges were infrequent aug

 began to squeeze happy jack 22 drunk in along the red deer his terse journal entries 23 drunk give little
 indication of whether he welcomed or 24 red had a calf 8 days over 25 still drunk resented their intrusion
 given his irascible nature 26 sick it is often presumed he was not fond of sharing 27 dam sick the

 feeble the company of all those who stopped at his home 30 long live booze hurrah for hell nesters and
 cowboys were equally welcome to stop for the night or even just share some beans many of the wild tales
 involving happy jack bacon or baloney 2 also involve booze and his reputation spread 1912 dec 1 river froze up

 relates 30 dam drunk he controlled himself drinking it was only when 31 feeble hurrah for hell he got too
 much company that he d get drunk the isolation of the badlands that happy jack most the time he got
 drunk was when some found in 1903 was now gone and the world had body went there with a bottle
 and there was a come to the badlands in the form of sheepherder s few riders around the country so
 they d go and sodbusters fences and boundanes and finally there and take a bottle and get him drunk you
 see but i don t think he bought much on his o n rules and politics toward the latter part
 of the at all and some of them should of had more ‘ teens political and social change was blowing
 sense than to of bought it for him because over alberta like a spring chinook raising ternhis habit was when
 he got good and drunk if pers wherever it passed the united farmers of there was some guys there he

 happy jack most rain was going to give them a crop and only the reasons behind happy jack s reaction

 sheepherders 29 numerous versions of the the homesteaders were swept up in the desolate jilted affair story are often used
 to account for winds of drought happy jack lost many friends his staunch bachelorhood as well as his depar and

 mexico but they were only an his land and his cattle as warren fulton recalls ominous portent of the hell
 yet to come the economic collapse her alding the great depression hie said they came after him from hanna and
 made farming and ranching on the prairies futile said if he didn t pay up his taxes they were going

 throughout the thirties charlton has always been ‘ ‘ a political cynic so s i l si the social credit
 movement was a protest ‘ ‘ ‘ movement to begin with and therefore it had wide support there was a
 lot of good representatives in the social credit movement start sample page from jackson s diary for august 1924 with
 there was cowboys and teacher s and preachers but there was a shortage of lawyers by aberhart but by the
 time aberhartia and mr abethart had a haiti time getting one lawyer social credit swept the election it was obvious

 ready to experiment with a new so but with little explanation in an october 1935 cial order in the provincial
 elections of 1935 newspaper interview jackson simply stated it aberhart s electoral machinery was lubricated by don t matter what
 any of these politicians tell me charismatic oratory and propaganda skills learned i don t believe ‘ em this country
 isn t ready for from years of evangelical preaching from the in fanatics to run its affairs 42 happy jack
 was dications of his journal it appears happy jack in almost certainly influenced in his condemnation itially held some hope

 situation dec 31 good by 37 2 years and five months no dividens they were quite disparaging of abethart they
 didn t discuss his stuff except the things that he preoccupied with social credit jackson s jourdid wrong how he
 misled people and how nal hints of weary resignation by the end of the he was the undoing of alberta
 no they weren t taken in not at all because he d been one of decade a significant indication of
 the change in these way out ministers long before he ever got happy jack was the alteration of one of
 his into politics and he was already established favourite phrases my kingdom for a bottle as a nut by then

 had another building which could have been fixed up but he didn t want to much of aberhart s overwhelming
 support leave that spot i guess he accepted it he may among the ordinary people of alberta rose from go
 the way he did go his wild promises primarily the promise of the basic dividend a monthly payment of 25

 tough you suck warren fulton remembers he really lived in ers that voted social credit to get his own way
 a pretty good kind of a life but in basic dividens have you got them yet so long 36 later

 sad he just wouldn t leave the place and yet he months is up where is your basic needed somebody
 near jackson s cabins dividens remained his bastion against the elements and the feb 28 another month gone no dividens
 world and the final years of happy s journal yet record a tone of sad bitterness 1940 feb 26 the

 said that may 18 not a dam soul left all dead he was found naked in his chair with his
 trusty 20 had a fall down pistol at his side even the circumstances of his 28 warren fulton was here
 death have become legendary 31 lime draging no dividens yet oral reminiscences and cryptic almanac nota aug 10 not a
 soul left in alberta tions the sources used to tell happy jack s stor y are not always in agreement
 with the legendary after years in the badlands cursing away on picture of jackson the isolation of the mexico the
 pages of dr chase s almanac battling with ranch the broken down cabins and his caustic drought and storms and
 mosquitoes it seems journal inspire the same reaction in many people difficult to believe happy jack stuck it out why
 they view happy jack as a cynical drunk who if life was so difficult them did he stay it s
 pos seemed to have little use for the world or any of sible he had nowhere else to go on
 the other its inhabitants trying to understand happy jack s hand after 35 years a certain attachment must life and
 his r eactions to a lonely existence people have grown even within jackson s calloused colour it with preconceptions of
 his eccentricity heart perhaps his journal gives a distorted view as the preceding history of jackson indicates of his life
 maybe happy despite his complaints those who knew him often have a different view really did like living on the
 mexico as johnny of the man and his era they remember a cranky fryberger a local cowboy believes old man
 who liked to drink but they also remem well i guess he like to live alone and the river ber
 that he was above a ll a generous neighbour kinda grows on ya course there s people like someone whose
 independence and sincerity althat though t hey complain about everything and lowed him to see straight to the core of
 things they just live like that they wouldn t be happy he had no desire to be anything else or
 anywhere if they weren t complaining no i don t think else the mexico ranch was his own small kinghe

 granum the baseball player who assaulted umpire c r robinson of macleod after the granum claresholm match at granum last
 friday was convicted in short order by judge harvey in the supreme court today the trial occupied all the morning
 mr robinson described the occurrence on the 27 th and said that barker approached him called him a rotten umpire
 with unprintable prefixes and struck him in the face before he had a chance to defend himself knocking him down
 he testified that while on the ground barker struck him again and that he was kicked sever al times he
 could not say by whom e p mcneill and w g lynch of macleod who witnessed the affair although they
 were too far away to hear what was said described the blows similarly barker on his own behalf said that
 he stepped up to robinson to expostulate over his decisions and used substantially the language referred to he said that
 robinson replied you call me that at the same time doubling his fists and assuming a beligerent attitude barker said
 that both struck together but that his own blow earned the more weight and robinson fell he denied striking the
 umpire a second time or kicking him eight or ten witnesses wer e produced by barker who swore that robinson
 assumed a menacing attitude when barker spoke to him and that both men struck at each other simultaneously the court
 however without waiting to hear the crown prosecutor said that without reflecting on these witnesses it was satisfied that the
 assault had been committed and that it was unprovoked sentence was deferred barker in the meantime being committed to custody
 the granum club has sent a formal written apology to the macleod club and also to manager nelson barker will
 never again be seen in a granum uniform the town has behaved very handsomely in the matter and barker has

 second world war and that conspicuous bones may be found there even now to locate this hill one must look

 la biche letters of w e trail 1874 1881 part one edited by edward j mccullough and michael maccagno in
 the early 1900 s william e traill began writing short articles on his experiences in the canadian west he was
 one of the few remaining old timers who recognized the value of his experiences and the importance of communicating them
 to others his flair for writing was part of a family tr adition his mother was catharine parr strickland the
 author of seven books including the backwoods of canada london 1835 she was a member of a famous literary family
 which included sisters agnes strickland who wr ote lives of the queens of england london 1840 48 and susanna moodie
 author of roughing it in the bush london 1852 as well as a brother samuel strickland author of twenty seven
 years in canada west london 1853 william traill however did not produce a major account of his life in the
 west his brief reminiscences now in the glenbow archives were never finished fortunately he also was a prolific letter writer
 and recorded significant events and personal experiences which provide insight into life on the frontier the following are excerpts from
 letters written at lac la biche during the period 1874 to 1881 supplemented with excerpts from his reminiscences paragraphs nd
 sentences have been rearranged spelling corrected and punctuation added where necessary to present an orderly compendium of traill s thoughts
 additions by the editors are placed in square brackets items judged to be extr aneous to lac la biche have
 been omitted the editors have tried to retain the literary style used by traill in his reminiscences he wrote in
 the first person noting that it is against the grain for me to write so much in the first person
 singular but when one is situated as i was and no one now a live cognizant of the facts left
 to chronicle the same i ask an indulgent public to excuse me for my style 2 it is precisely this
 style which permitted the editing of traill s letters into a form which closely parallels that of the reminiscences this
 article is the first of three parts dealing with the period from spring 1874 to the summer of 1875 ijoined
 the hudson s bay company as a clerk biche is a very dull out of the way hole there in
 1864 while serving at fort ellice i met my is however a roman catholic fr ench mission future wife harriet
 eldest daughter of chief close to the post some of the priests are very in trader william mckay we were
 married in 1869 telligent men and the nuns are very nice creatures and have three children we have been informed
 the post is very comfortable in some respects that lam to take charge of the lac la biche post 1
 there is a small farm a mill cows c so if i am glad i am going to lac la
 biche if i get the person in charge does not live comfortably it on well i will not remain a
 clerk more than three is his own fault fish is the staple article of diet years if not i may
 as well bid good bye to the but with all the conveniences i have mentioned service one thing in my
 favor is that i cannot anyone of any recour se can gr eatly add to the do worse tha n
 my predecessor has done 3 lac la cuisine 4 summer 1874 arrival at inc la biche when we arrived at
 lac la biche all was done for her that could be done but it was only too evi on july
 27 1874 i left carlton to take charge dent that our darling was to be taken from us we of
 my post at lac la biche my wife harriet and arrived on saturday at noon we sat up with my
 children walter katie and molly accom our darling that night we had intended taking her panied me at carlton our
 dear ones werel all in to the roman catholic mission on the sunday but good health little did we think
 that we would go when the sunday came i saw that it would be a soon be bereft of our
 little lamb god saw fit risk but as one of the people from here was going to take from us
 the flower of our little flock my to church i sat down to write a note to the pere darling
 little mary molly we always called her with whom i was acquainted asking for assistance was taken from us the
 day after we arrived at this but whilst writing i was startled by a cry from the place lac la
 biche we always hoped we poor mother who was holding the dear child in would find someone her e that
 could give relief her arms i started up to find my child in the throes to our darling pet molly
 but it was the will of god of death a fit of coughing had carried her off that she should
 be taken from us 6 three days we were prepared for our child being taken from out from carlton our
 childr en caught a bad cold us but not so suddenly oh how hard it is to part which turned
 out to be the whooping cough last with a loved child in a str ange place and among winter all
 the children at prince albert had it but tota l strangers with but one kind friend who could ours and
 when we got to carlton they were con comfort us under our sore trial stantly in contact with children recovering
 from we had our darling buried in the garden from it long em we left carlton the complaint had dis
 whence we will have her removed in winter to appeared and we hoped hat our children had quite prince albert
 where we expect our future home escaped but they caught it when no one was near to be the poor
 mother had to dress it with her that had it own hands dear dear little molly now that she is
 gone we can say our father thy will be for nearly a week the weather was very cold done we
 would not wish her back knowing raw which of course was unfavourable for the that what is our loss is
 her eternal gain but yet little sufferers still they bor e up well he darling it is hard to bear
 we will console our selves by molly was good and playful never giving he least the hope of joining her
 in that realm of bliss where trouble she had a smile for every one she was parting sin and sorrow
 shall be known no more beginning to stand by catching hold of anything poor harrieti she feels our loss very
 much she and was crawling about at fort pitt they all got is left much to herself as i am
 always busy and wor se especially walter who rather alarmed us there is only one woman in the establishment and
 but when we left that place he and katie got she is blind 7 livelier but the dear molly began
 to get worse this is a pretty place the post is built on the our third or fourth day she
 began to give us some south shore of the lake a fine sheet of water alarm at last we left
 the cart brigade hoping to the lake is 25 miles in extreme length and varying reach lac la biche our
 second day and thought f rom two or three to eight miles in width there it probable that some one
 ther e could give our are islands in it but so large as not to be distinlittle one relief if
 it was the will of god that she guishable from the main shore 8 although this should be spar ed
 to us our horses wer e not good is a pr etty situation i cannot say much for the and
 the trail execrable the wor st i ever was on dwellings or other buildings the establishment so that instead of
 taking 2 days we only arrived consists of the officer s house which is a long low our fourth day
 at noon for the last two days back roofed log house resembling a byre there our darling took no notice
 of anything her dear is a similar one but just like it with two r ooms eyes wandered unceasingly from
 side to side and she moaned slightly but unceasingly but never bom in lac la biche e j mccullough is
 a cononce from the time she left fort pitt did she utter suiting archaeologist in calgary mr maccagno a the
 slightest cry dear little soul it was very dis former mla and longtime resident of lac la biche l now
 lives in calgar y tresstng to see her hope of meeting her in those realms of bliss that she is
 now an inhabitant of mr mckay her grandfather in writing us after he heard of our sad loss said that
 molly was too good a child to remain with us on this earth she was a dear dear child and
 when nicely dressed was very pretty in our eyes at least the other children have had a trying time nor
 are they quite over it sometimes we fancy the cough has almost left them then in spite of all our
 care they seem much worse just now they are suffering from a complaint which is making the rounds sore ears
 little katie i cured with harts horn sweet oil and the same medicine cured others but walter continues to suffer
 he is quite deaf today but not in such great pain i trust he will recover his hearing in a
 day or two we do not intend to let the natives have the run of the whole house as they
 have been want at this place i am getting along pretty well so far with the tr ade and hope
 in time to get things in good order everyone kills fish for their winter most families have from 2 to
 3 thousand according to the number of persons dogs for all keep at least one tr ain of dogs and
 as each dog must have a fish per day they r equire a good stock on october 17 or 18
 th i will be starting out my fishermen to the fall fishing in fall we set in the spawning grounds
 which are about 10 or 12 miles from the house we will haul the fish by dogs in winter i
 hope to get from 10 to 15 000 white fish if i get even 10 thousand i shall have abundance
 for the whole winter while my fishermen were off to the fisheries i had to fish for the establishment cut
 haul wood c c i liked fishing when the weather is not too cold but it is no fun to
 overhaul a net when the ice is floating in the water though these men do it in mid winter at
 any possible degree of fr ost and that bare handed 3 harriet is very proud of her accomplishments as a
 sportsman she has been practising with the gun lately to the sorrow of the prairie chickens and visits the rabbit
 snares she has made she says she wants to learn how to put down a net but i fear it
 will be some time ere she conquer s her fear of water she does not feel at home in a
 canoe but hunting is not her only accomplishment she can cook and make my clothes as well for the men
 the trade shop and fish store ar e much the same only smaller there is a pig stye stable and
 tumble down byre that consitutes the establishment of lac la biche 9 in summer we set our nets just in
 front of the house for you must know living at lac la biche consists of fish three times a day
 or as often as you like i do not want better living han we have had since we came here
 fish cooked in half a dozen different ways boiled fried fresh split smoked salted fish c then we have ducks
 prairie chickens c partridges rabbits with a taste of beaver moose nose c with vegetables we will soon have beef
 pork to add to our bit of far e so you see we are in no danger of starving as
 at plains post as the fish stock is inexhaustable ‘ fall 1874 it is october and our dear molly is
 still very much in our minds dear soul how we miss her at ever y turn she was so amiable
 and quiet and good even when sick and suffering she never once cried during her illness from pitt till she
 was taken from us here we cannot but miss her but do not grieve for her knowing that she is
 now happy in the arms of her saviour she has escaped all the snares temptations sorrows pains tears of this
 life and doubtless now looks down upon us god give us gr ace to live more with a william i
 traill 1886 as any wife i could have found in a civilized coun the best fisherman and net maker in
 the north but tr y and above all she is a loving true wife am i nearly lost him he
 was overhauling his nets in i not a fortunate man a storm and upset was about drowned when in october
 we got our two cases goods from rescued by others he could not stand when put on orkney about 30
 worth to which mrs mr shore he was a couple of hour s in ice water he mckay have added
 sever al nice presents mr was nearly drowned a second time trying to cross mckay s present to harriet is
 a very neat tweed on the ice before it was strong enough if possible walking dress mrs mckay sent her
 several i intend to try a drag net next fall we get enough things for the children with several pounds
 of as it is but take rather too long for my liking we sweets for the little ones from their
 aunt kate have above 10 000 white fish 20 bags pemican we had a visit from a missionary october 14
 th i have killed 2 oxen and will kill several pigs ‘ and enjoyed the service exceedingly his name we
 are pretty comfortable this winter having is steinhaur a full blooded indian from lake plenty to eat which is a
 great consideration the simcoe he was brought up educated at ain trade however is poor there being a wonderful wick
 by old father chase he knows rice lake scarcity of fur bearing animals ‘ i rather fear we and was
 at the indian village there he came out will not have an extra good winter for furs howhere in ‘
 55 just after the rice lake bridge was ever it is hard to judge by the country round here built
 he is stationed about 50 miles from this and as several of our hunters go for some on the will
 visit us once a month ‘ athabasca some towards lesser slave lake wher e furs are more abundant than here
 ‘ wtnter 1874 75 we passed but a dull time of christmas and winter set fairly in on the 1
 st of november new years we were altogether alone on the lake did not freeze over till the 15 th
 by christmas and on new year s day we had far november 22 the thermometer at 25 already more visitors
 than was either agreeable or con the fishery is only just over so all hands are off venient we had
 to feast every one of our neighto their hunting grounds i am fortunate in having bour s as well as

 time the people with whom i have much sorrow and suffering and now enjoys eternal to dea l are a
 tiresome set i sometimes wish i was rest while we her unworthy parents are left to at some other occupation
 than trading furs which suffer mourn is by no means congenial to my taste it is the i am happy
 to say that the childr en tho they meanest occupation out for one is constantly cough at times are in
 good health and full of fun being abused by every old indian that comes they cannot bear to speak of
 their little sister along if i could afford it i would leave the ser they remember that she was put
 into the earth vice however two a half years will be all i and cannot bear the thoughts they cannot
 bear will serve whether i get better encouragement than to see their mother cry dear children god bless i have
 at present keep them 23 they had a long and hard time i do not know when my turn will
 come but one of it during the whooping cough walter is growthing is certain and that is that when i
 get a ing fast but katie is still very small she will alfurlough i will not lose any time in
 availing myself ways be a small thing harriet was teaching him of it had my trade this year been successful
 i a grace out of mother s little book for the children might have stood a chance but such not
 being the give us thankful hearts he stopped said case tho it is no fault of mine my chance of
 get what kind of hearts rabbit hearts i suppose ting away is ver y small it was a down right
 swin poor boy he is very fond of rabbit hearts and as dle leading me to suppose at the first
 that i should it was a grace he took it to mean his favourite dish have a chance of going
 home after seven years he knows all his letters and katie knows most such is never the case no nor
 at the end of ten of hers walter is a very good boy and very tractyears very seldom any one
 gets leave except on able katie is more troublesome but has very winplea of ill health of course commissioned officers
 ning ways are different in hbco s service the higher you rise the less you have to do and the
 higher wages spring 1875 you get i wish i had my foot on the first rung this letter comes to
 you from fort pitt on the of the ladder sooner or later i will take to farming saskatchewan river my
 tr ade has not been a myself time flies very fast i cannot realize that good one but mr lawrence
 clarke writes me i have been nearly 11 years in the service ‘ i do that he is well satisfied
 considering hat it was hard not know when i shall get out to the civilized year for furs we have
 had an extremely long world again there is a probability of the com winter and remarkably deep snow and consepany
 making a road through this part of the coun quently the rivers are all or have been remarkably tr y
 from some point on the saskatchewan above high the spring has been almost unpr ecedented fort pitt to the forks
 of the athabasca in which for floods on all the rivers rising in the rocky case this place would be
 one of some importance mountains this north branch broke up before the i hope such maybe the case as we
 are altogether ice had in any way melted this fort pitt tho built shut out from the civilized world on
 a high ground was nearly flooded and at harriet has been unwell poor girl she frets carlton built on still
 higher ground the ice too much she finds this place so lonely 9 blocked against the bastions of the fort
 still lower we have no friends there is one very respectable down at prince albert the people had to take
 the english family who live about two miles off and hills for their lives and five indians and some cattle
 then the mission people they are all french but were drowned on the south branch matters were speak tolerable english
 the nuns are very kind much the same but no lives lost one of them is an old friend of
 mrs mckay s but the most remarkable flood occurred on the and very kind to harriet the children 20 i
 athabasca at fort mcmurray on the forks of the thought that she was resigned to the sad loss of athabasca
 clear water river the river rose in our darling but when she is feeling ill she frets the course of
 half an hour to the remarkable height very much 2 poor harriet grieves excessively of 63 feet canying off sever
 al of the buildings she cannot reconcile herself to this place at all of the fort and drowning all the
 transport oxen and no wonder our darling was taken from us the mr moberly the officer in charge came on
 foot to lac la biche to try and get animals to replace money sake but for the sake of those
 who are those drowned i supplied him with the number dependent upon me i live comfortably myself and required and
 am left without any animals do not allow my family to want any necessary with harriet s confinement soon approaching
 if we have privations it is for the want of socie i came here to fort pitt to pick up
 mrs mckay ty but then we are free from a great deal of the it will be very pleasant for
 harriet to have her heart burnings and jealousies of civilized life and mother for a short time 25 i had
 a rather rough have trust what campbell the poet calls the all trip to fort pitt owing to the accident
 in the in all of life content 27 north i had to give all my animals to make up an
 otherwise irr epairable loss and was only left summer 1875 death of brother alexis reynard with one horse with which
 i had to make my way early this summer the roman catholic to fort pitt chiefly on foot as the
 horse was mission at chippewan on athabasca lake sent carrying ihadto send out my packs by the r c a
 small party by boat or canoe to the distant mis mission carts i travelled in company with the sion at
 lee la biche the party consisted of three r c mission people one day then forked off per sons frere
 alexis a lay brother an iroquois to white fish lake where i had business the indian by the name of
 michel a young woman people at that place were next thing to starving an orphan who was to be transferr
 ed from one so they ate up all my provisions after which i orphanage to the other at the same
 time there had to make my way through the woods back to were two families of retiring hudson s bay
 comthe fort pitt road depending on my gun for pro pany serva nts who had served the company visions every
 creek was a river and every river for some years in the north and who were going a flood we
 nearly dr owned our hor se in the to lac la biche to settle thomas i should say beaver river
 at another creek we assayed to tomas huppie duncan tremblay and their cross on a temporary bridge that had been
 in use families these people had a canoe of their own but which at that time was afloat the horse
 broke and were provisioned for the journey by the cornthrough the bridge and would have been dr owned pany for
 companionship mutual help these but we managed to haul him over the bridge on people agreed to travel together little
 dreaming his side we were nearly to our knees in water however of the terrible events that the future had
 on the bridge of course the saddle bags got wet in store for them my papers were not improved by
 the soaking the mode of travel on the large rivers of the they got we would have had some difficulty
 in north was generally what was called tracking finding our way but happened to fall in with an which in
 reality was towing i am speaking of old half breed who knew the country and who i course of ascending
 a stream the men comhir ed to guide me through prising the party whose adventures i am attempt we arrived
 back at lac la biche on the 5 th ing to chronicle were well used to the mode of on
 june 25 1875 harriet presented me with a travel but the season was june at which time most fine little
 son willie i say little but he is quite of the rivers of the north were at high flood on
 a giant bigger than walter was he has very large that occasion the river was in flood they had hands
 feet and a nose that will do credit to both passed fort mcmurray a considerable distance traills mckays both mother
 baby are doing however the party made but slow progress agalnst well i am thankful to say he strong current
 consequently their stock of pm i have saved about half my wages for this year visions was exhausted game was
 scarce or the and trust while in the service to be able to put by members of the party were
 poor hunters so that an equal sum say 250 which i will always they soon were reduced to great straits
 to make invest of course trouble may come and prevent matters worse the iroquois michel cast amorous my realising such
 a saving but i think i can do gla nces at the young woman and gave the worthy so i
 have need to put by a little because i have brother who had her in charge no end of trouble
 need to put walter to school education for my the retiring servants now counselled returning children shall be my great
 aim if it pleases god to fort mcmurray at the confluence of the clear to spare them to me i
 lay no store on money for water iver to obtain a fr esh supply of pr ovisions it is very
 apparent that the two men tremblay huppie anticipated trouble for the good brother at any rate when they did at
 last return instead of landing at the house river where they left the mission party they passed by on the
 other side they landed their families about a mile above on the north side of the athabasca then paddled down
 stream to the mouth of the house river what subsequently transpired can only be conjectured the men themselves giving very
 varying accounts the women however on their arrival several days afterwards at the lac la biche mission said that from
 the place where their husbands left them they could not see the old camp it being hidden by a bend
 in the river about the time that their husbands should have landed they heard two shots in quick succession shortly
 after they saw their husbands paddling for dear life they said they have eaten each other but were very reticient
 of what they really saw the women then stated that they did not camp that night until very late and
 pressed on almost night and day always ca mping on the north side of the river until they reached the
 mission the story that they told with many variations did not at all satisfy the good missionaries who immediately organized
 a party to go overland to the scene of the tragedy for this purpose they secured the services of some
 of the most expert hunter s who could be r elied upon to follow up trails of man or beast
 who were experts in all manner of woodcraft the seatth party had dinner at the fort en passant if i
 am not mistaken it was the reverend pere leduc who was in charge of the party he gave me the
 whole history of the affair up to that time and promised to give me full details of their investigations he
 said that there could be no doubt about the murder of the brother alexis but they hoped to find the
 iroquois and the girl and bring the former to justice on his return after an absence of many days he
 related to me the results of their search they first visited the camp at the mouth of the house river
 where they found evidences of one of the most terrible tr agedies that has ever blackened the annals of the
 great west the skull of the lay brother was found with a bullet hole which showed that he had been
 shot fr om behind they also found many of the bones the larger of which had been broken to extract
 the marrow the shirt son who has committed cannibalism cannot be of the victim was also found years after when
 killed that would account for the men never i happened to be the guest of the hospitable priest camping on
 the south side of the river at st albert i was shown the shirt it was cut on the other
 hand the iroquois may have killed open down the front and on the sleeves just as and eaten the girl
 during their wanderings but it a hunter would take the skin from any animal that is almost incredible that the
 indians and halfhe might kill no doubt the same is preserved as breeds who accompanied the search party found a
 relic to this very day no traces of any strife between the fugitives nor but to return to my tale
 several days were spent any trace of her remains by the party in endeavouring to find the iroquois the worthy
 pere who i told my theory did not and the girl but without any success evidently once interrupt me but
 when i finished he merely after the tragedy the iroquois and the girl had remarked i do not know but
 what you are right gone off together following the river bank for mr traill of course the priests through the
 miles but they had returned to the scene of the confessional leamed all that the two survivors and murder but
 no further trace of them could be dis their wives knew but what they learned will never covered it is
 very evident that they did not take be known by the public to the river for the boat or skiff
 was still there in conclusion i would say that mr h j mober many theories have been advanced as to
 the dis ly who was at that time in charge of fort mcmurappearance of the iroquois and the girl but
 it is ray holds a totally different theory as to the fate probable that only when the gr aves give
 up their of the iroquois but his heory in no way accounts dead and the secrets of all hearts will
 be revealed for the disappearance of the girl furthermore an will it be known what became of them i have
 indian who happened on the scene of the tragedy a theory which i will give for what it is worth
 between the return of the men huppie and trem which i discussed with my very valued friend blay and the
 arrival of the relief party openly the rev pere leduc who was in charge of the accused the two men
 of having disposed of the mission at lac la biche at the time of the tragedy iroquois and the girl
 in he manner i have sug i gave him my ideas on the subject as follows gested he told them
 that they were both telling the cause of the quarrel if there was a quarrel a parcel of lies and
 that they had killed and diswas in all probability the girl the probability is posed of the cannibals he said
 he knew the facts however hat there was no open quarrel but that from the traces he had observed it
 is probable the iroquois had shot the brother when his back that a storm of rain had obliterated these traces
 was turned but whether the motive was to get between the time of his visit and that of the seamh
 possession of the girl or whether with canni party which would account in great measure for ba listic intent cannot
 be known whether they the guides of that party being unable to read the committed cannibalism at once would seem
 uncer whole of the events by the traces left by the actors tam most likely they fled together along the
 in the tragedy river but after walking many miles and being to be continued unable to kill any game the
 pangs of hunger drove them back to the body of the murdered man on the flesh they lived for days
 till the flesh was all notes consumed and at last they wer e r educed to picking the bones and

 grand opera house last evening and by the way it might be mentioned casually that we employ the best troupes
 second to irving only in our town i had always envied the dreamy myth like life of an actor but
 before leaving the opera house last night my opinion had suddenly changed before the play commenced the principal character a
 very handsome young man appeared upon the stage for the purpose of addressing a few remarks to the audience his
 remarks rate as follows no doubt you have all come here this evening with the intention of being pleased nd
 it is our object to please you but while amusing you do you imagine that we also are amused still
 we sometime are and sometimes we are not our lives are not all sunshine as hey appeared to be and
 in the walks of life we as often tread upon thorns as upon the smooth path we often times feel
 as sad as you do and like you are often obliged to smile while our heart sinks this very day
 has been one of the most sorrowful days of my life and notwithstanding this fact we are billed this evening
 to play hands across the sea and i shall be expected to play it as if to day had been
 one of the most sanguine days of my life the cause of all my bitter feelings is this to day
 as i was up in the attic hunting for some old costume for this evening i came across a little
 golden br aid of hair tied with a piece of blue ribbon this recalled to me the few years of
 blessed happiness i had passed but a few years ago and what a big change there is in my life
 since then but a few short years ago i was the fortunate possessor of a handsome loving wife and a
 beautiful boy but they have both been consigned to earth and things have a ll changed since then there was
 not one eye was dry in the audience and i could not help thinking how different things would have been

 who are said to be wanted to harvest the great grain crop of manitoba and the northwest will leave toronto
 today and it will take several special trains to carry them all the harvesters excur sions as they are called
 extend over three days of this week and how far ontario will respond to the demands of the west is
 a question that even the r ailroad men cannot answer they have an idea that the prospects for obtaining farm
 laborers are very much better than they looked a few weeks ago and think that all the men requir ed
 will be obtained already the harvester s are on their way westward for on monday last the first excursion started
 from the territory east of megantic and quebec the excursion from the maritime provinces in ontario something that has to
 be considered is this first that the harvest here is a large one and second that it is a little
 later han usual the latter fact makes work for farm hands plentiful at a period when they are usually disengaged
 while the young farmers who under ordinary circumstances could get away may not leave on these excursions the canadian pacific
 railway which is the road principa lly interested in the harvesters excursions has divided the ontario territory into three parts
 so as to not have any congestion of traffic and the district to be covered today is from kingston and
 sharbot lake up to but not including toronto and north of toronto to north bay including the midland division most
 of the farm laborers will centre in toronto this morning and go out on the several special trains which will
