 of ninety one vitally interested in the welfare of her fellow man from the quiet of her dartmoor ranch home

 quite an experience to have lived long enough to see the reigns of six british sovereigns and the tremendous changes
 that have taken place since 1868 born in london england on january 9 th 1868 she was the daughter of
 colonel e l marryat and elizabeth lynch marryat of county mayo ireland her father was a civil engineer with the
 east india company and the eight parlby children spent part of their childhood in india before their father retired and
 returned to england to become an official of the bengal northwestern railway and the delta light railway the parlby home
 in alix contains many beautiful souvenirs of india and mrs parlby has many happy memories of the time spent there
 mostly in the punjab and the mountain resort of muree in the himalyas which furnished relief from the hot indian
 summers returning to england the family lived at lympsfield in surrey where the girls were educated by governesses irene was
 sixteen when the family returned and although life was pleasant in surrey she began to feel restless she had a
 lively mind and her father s keen interest in public affairs was a great influence in her life and her
 thinking since reading settlers in canada by her great uncle col marrycit young irene had wanted to visit canada and
 the opportunity came in 1896 when she was invited to visit friends from canada mrs pariby is seen here in
 a photograph taken in about 1917 when she was president of the united farm women of alberta the trip to
 lacombe was a long one over a rough road bed but it was made more pleasant by the invitation of
 lt gov charles mackintosh to join him in his private car they disembarked at lacombe and an exciting if harrowing
 28 mile trip by democrat followed there was always the danger of upsetting in the seemingly bottomless mud and young
 irene did not know what to make of the situation when they came to a creek to find only the
 top poles of the bridge showing a successful crossing was effected however and the party was with her hosts the
 charles westheads she left england in may for the long journey to their ranch home near buffalo lake in the

 first he was persuaded to the absence of all complications stresses stay an extra two weeks and spent the worries
 and what not of such a life i rest of his life here feel so sorry for the late corners
 who had not that experience most of the early settlers preferred to locate adjacent to railway lines but the parlbys

 opportunity tivation of the land must be followed it was natural that the young couple by cultivation of a worthy
 social and economic system of living should be attracted and by early fall they were engaged to be married on
 the parlbys helped build st monica s march 15 1897 walter parlby and irene mission church in lamerton now mir

 diseases ing that one day she would play a early frosts hail and fire were always threats prominent part in
 administering the affairs of the new province there were few neighbors but those as the residents of the new province
 who were there were of similar back gained the right to administer their own ground and interest and they maintained
 affairs they began too to take an inmany of their old country ways a de terest in forming organizations which
 lightful diary in possession of mrs would promote their welfare the ccina parlby and written by her cousin paints dian
 society of equity was formed and a pleasant picture of dances house the following year the alberta farmers association mrs
 parlby describes the beginnings of the new farm movement thusly as settlement increased a new spirit crept over the land
 the old careless freedom departed men grew suspicious less friendly and there were murmurs of exploitation and of rank injustices
 to the farmers underground rumblings of discontent were heard and then outspoken words and spasmodic attempts at organization in different
 and more or less isolated parts of the province of alberta small and rather vague beginnings of organization but the
 erstwhile incoherent ideas gave way to more definite plans and so began the organization of that powerful group the united
 farmers of alberta the new group was interested in economics and politics where farm interests were concerned in the federal
 field they agitated for tariff reduction a canada grain act and financial aid for livestock marketing and in the provincial
 arena they wanted increased rural credit hail insurance and a co operative elevator company the new movement won enthusiastic support
 from the parlbys and walter parlby was the first president of the alix local an auxiliary to the ufa was
 mr and mrs walter parlby as photographed during a visit to england in 1910 and in revision of the curriculum
 of the department of education it also helped establish the junior farm movement and assisted with school fairs and community
 clubs presidency of the ufwa led mrs pariby to other fields of work and in 1918 she attended a dominion
 conference of women in ottawa at the invitation of the prime minister to further war work she also advised on
 problems concerning immigration of women she served on the board of governors of the university of alberta and held official
 formed and the countrywomen s club at alix which mrs parlby had helped organize in 1913 became local number one
 and has remained so to the present day in 1916 mrs parlby was named as a delegate to the ufa
 convention in calgary and delivered a paper on women s place in the nation later in the week she was
 elected president of the provincial auxiliary she believed however that the organization should have full status and set herself positions
 in the alberta red cross society and on the canadian council of agriculture in 1920 at the end of four
 years as president of the ufwa she felt that with the organization acknowledged as an integral part of the ufa
 it would be permissable without shirking to return to the quiet life of home and garden and she resigned as
 president this had been her first introduction into a life other than the sheltered one she had always known it
 did much to bring out her latent abilities she had a fine gift for writing speaking for leadership and organization
 and the experience gave her the opportunity of contributing to the development of the province she had come to love
 dearly the task of changing it from an auxilliary to an organization in its own right she was successful in
 this and the organization was renamed the united farm women of alberta its aims were educational and social and it
 hoped to increase and broaden the knowledge of farm women as well as to meet the need for social contact
 among women in the isolated farm communities in addition to co operating with the ufa on matters affecting the welfare
 of rural albertans the ufwa played a prominent part in establishing municipal hospitals in the appointment of public health nurses

 water we were close to the peigan indian reserve and in indian country by now it was may 1887 we
 decided to herd our horses and cattle at night from there on because we were afraid the indians might not
 be friendly i being the youngest married man in the company herded the first night i took my saddle horse
 and gun and went out into a very dark night our cattle were mostly lying down the grass was good
 and they were full i rounded up the horses and put them on the flat above the camp i then
 went a short distance away and got off my horse and held the bridle reins in one hand and let
 him eat everything was quiet and peaceful until sometime after midnight i heard a horse snort i gathered up the
 reins and got into the saddle in double quick time it was none too soon for the horses had stampeded
 and were coming directly towards me i rode with the horses for some distance i kept calling to them until
 they stopped and then i rode around them quietly and drove them back i never did know what frightened them
 when daylight came i drove into camp needless to say i laid down in the wagon and slept a good
 part of the day as we went through dupuyer a little bread village on the birch creek which wa the
 south line of the peigan reservation then we moved on to the agency cn badger creek we had a talk
 with the agent about crossing the reservation we found that the winter before 1886 u 387 had been a very
 hard one there were 8 000 hides racked up at the agency and the agent said that they didn t
 get half of the cattle skinned that died fearing the rivers ahead of us would be too high to fcrd
 we bought lumber from the agent for a boat we built the bcat that afternoon and moved on to the
 two medicine river and camped carly the indians gathered around us by the hundreds out of curiosity they had never
 seen so many white topped wagons we hadn t been camped very long when an indian policeman rode into camp
 and handed president card a paper from the agent the note said an indian claimed a white pony owned by
 john a woolf and we would have to bring him back to the agency three of us took the horse
 and went back we found a great many indians there the agent asked the complaining indian if that pony was
 his he said yes he asked him how long ago he had lost his horse the indian said he had
 lost the horse several years ago then the agent asked how he could identify his horse and the indian replied
 by the black spots on his legs j a woolf said i can take the black spots off it was
 tar from the wagon wheel which one of the little boys had put on with a stick he took out
 his pocket knife and scraped the tar off then the agent said to the indian that is not your horse
 you have never seen that horse before the agent asked another indian how long he had known this indian and
 he answered ten years the agent said do you know him to be truthful he answered i never knew him
 to tell the truth the agent cautioned us to keep the horse close or the indian might steal him when
 we got back to camp it was nearly dark an old indian named pete was there he could talk english
 and brother card knew him he told us that the indian that claimed the horse would shoot some of our
 horses or cattle if we didn t watch them the indian sat asked them if they had seen two boys
 on his horse just a little way from our driving cattle they said yes and camp brother card told us
 to get our they were coming all right so i rode on guns and let them know we were not

 the lack of uniformity in the time kept by the different clocks and watches in town is a standing nuisance
 and cause of bewilderment to every resident of the place whether permanent or transient but especially the latier it is
 proposed to adopt the new railway standard time as the standard for edmonton at a very slight expense this could
 be procured as often as necessary by telegraph a very small subscription would be sufficient to pay the post and
 mr jas mcdougall of the h b c offers to lend one of the small cannon now in the fort
 to be placed at the telegraph office and fired say at exactly twelve o clock every saturday by the operator
 so as to give people an opportunity of setting their clocks and watches right at least once a week and
 to secure the uniformity now so lacking and so desirable edmonton bulletin dec 29 1883 the iroquois in alberta by

 occupied by the bride s amiable mamma with her leige lord at the opposite end who was now suffering fearfully
 from the attack of rheumatism though he had a genial glow upon his smiling countenance he presided with his usual
 grace until the festive meal was about half finished when he had to succumb a few bottles of pain killer

 office and for the first time in a decade the government had to fight an election without the leadership of

 calgary the news town this one year old town is situated near the confluence of the bow and elbow rivers
 in the district of alberta within sight of the great canadian alps whose wreaths of eternal snow glisten in the
 sunlight and afford the traveller a never failing source of wonderment and pleasure the townsite is beautifully laid out in
 a regular natural basin formed by the wide bend of the bow and elbow rivers both of which here well
 deserve the name of bow the valley is here from a mile to a mile and a half wide to
 the east is the natural opening through which the canadian pacific enters the basin and to the west is a
 similar opening through which the train emerges on its westward course with the exception of these two gaps the immediate
 view is obstructed by bold magnificent and continuous bluffs whose escarpment exposes various kinds of valuable stone which will yet
 be a source of wealth to the town to one accustomed to the dead level of the eastern prairie or
 even to the rolling prairie of the assiniboine the valley of the bow affords a most agreeable variety and the
 traveller who enters it for the first time cannot help uttering exclamations of admiration it is no exaggeration to say
 that it is one of the finest townsites in north america it had already earned the distinction and it is
 well deserving of it but if the local scenery is varied and charming the view to the west where rise
 those majestic cliffs which have been often termed the backbone of north america is grand in the extreme the great
 cones show themselves here and there beyond the peaks of the foothills and pierce the sky with their snow clad
 sides and apicis calgary has already assumed the dimensions of a city there are at least three hundred buildings of
 all kinds in the place here are the headquarters of the mounted police there being a force of at least
 150 men the first townsite was laid out on the east side of the elbow close to where that river
 joins the bow but the location of the railway depot about a mile further west changed the business centre of
 the place and most of the eastenders moved over in the night time to the west side though the store
 of the hudson s bay company and that of messrs king co are still on the east side of the
 river the well known firms of i g baker co traders occupy grounds at the east end though on the
 west side of the elbow these firms are the largest in the place and as may be supposed do an
 immense business they have selected ground on the west side and they intend to build the barracks of the mounted
 police occupy a beautiful situation on the rising ground at the east end but it is evident that the heart
 of the business life is centering around the depot calgary nor wester may 6 1884 a buffalo hunt in 1875
