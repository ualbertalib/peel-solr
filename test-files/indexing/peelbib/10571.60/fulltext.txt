 the patrician 1997 2 colonel in chief princess patricia s canadian light infantry the countess mountbatten of burma cbe cd 
 jp dl message from the colonel in chief 1997 was once again a year of continuing change particularly with the 
 move of the first battalion to edmonton and a year when patricias everywhere demonstrated 0:demon 0:strated their irrefutable ability to 
 surmount extreme difficulties whether it be the distinction brought to the regiment by the second battalion during their extremely successful 
 deployment in the former yugoslavia or the determination and courage displayed by patricias from all battalions in southern manitoba during 
 the flood of the century the regiment as always has proven its reputation for excellence hard earned over the generations 
 this was indeed a happy year when i was able to visit all three battalions i was particularly grateful to 
 have the opportunity with my husband and the colonel of the regiment and nora to visit the second battalion in 
 bosnia their excellent performance confirmed to me by all accounts made me very proud and it is clear that they 
 have made a very real difference to bring about a lasting peace i was very pleased to find my patricias 
 in good shape during my tour to alberta in june with my daughter amanda and her husband charles although the 
 occasion was perhaps a sad one as the first battalion bid farewell to the city of calgary with a splendid 
 tattoo and sunset ceremony thereby ending for a time the regiment s garrison there a short trip to visit third 
 battalion in edmonton and a tour of the first battalion s new building ended any doubt that the new homes 
 for my first and third battalions in edmonton would suit their needs in every respect we can look on this 
 latest move as just another page turned in our association with communities throughout western canada a page that may well 
 be turned back sometime in the future it is unlikely that i will visit you in canada in 1998 but 
 i shall hear with great interest the tales of your exploits i was delighted to learn however that patricias from 
 the third battalion will form the guard at buckingham palace in may with drummers from the first and second battalions 
 this will no doubt give me a rare opportunity to see my patricias in good form in my own country 
 in addition it is with much excitement that i look forward to my next sojourn with my patricias in july 
 1999 for our 85th anniversary reunion in edmonton 
 the patrician 1997 3 colonel of the regiment princess patricia s canadian light infantry major general c w hewson cmm 
 cd message from the colonel of the regiment 1997 has been another notable year for all patricias as planned the 
 first battalion 0:bat 0:talion said farewell to currie barracks and calgary in june and joined the third battalion in garrison 
 edmonton that same month the ppcli battle school amalgamated 0:amalga 0:mated with cfb wainwright to become the western area training 
 centre both events were well planned and executed each was marked with appropriate ceremony 0:cer 0:emony and we were fortunate 
 to have the colonel in chief present for these significant 0:signifi 0:cant regimental occasions the prime story for 1997 however 
 was operations the second battalion augmented by the third formed the canadian battle group in the nato stabilization force in 
 bosnia for the first six months of the year the first and third battalions then provided the infantry component of 
 the strathcona s battle group serving for the balance of the year the performance of both battle groups was of 
 the very high professional standard we expect and which brings pride to all patricias again the colonel in chief joined 
 her patricias in the theatre of operations to celebrate the regimental day and to present sfor medals all three battalions 
 were called upon to serve canadians in response to two significant domestic emergencies in both the red river flood and 
 the quebec ontario ice storm canadian soldiers provided significant support to emergency organizations and civic governments which were struggling under 
 the weight of the crises these timely interventions were instrumental in averting what could have been much more devastating and 
 dangerous situations at the end of the day it was the cheerful confident and unselfish manner in which the military 
 support was provided that won the hearts of the citizens most affected and the unqualified respect 0:re 0:spect of all 
 canadians recent organizational turbulence and public controversy are now behind us public 0:pub 0:lic support generated by your totally professional 
 performance in sfor and unselfish service to canadians will be sustained patricias can be proud of these accomplishments 0:accomplish 0:ments 
 and of their significant contribution to the dramatic improvement in the public s perception of our profession we plan for 
 the future with renewed confidence vp 
 the patrician 1997 4 patricias at currie barracks the end of an era in the summer of 1997 princess patricia 
 s canadian light infantry and the city of calgary formally said goodbye to each other after 51 years of almost 
 continuous association the first battalion vacated their home and moved to lancaster park in edmonton along with other army units 
 following the regiment s service in world war i a detached rifle company 0:com 0:pany was based in work point 
 barracks at esquimalt bc while battalion headquarters 0:head 0:quarters and a second rifle company were stationed at fort osborne barracks 
 in winnipeg on mobilization in 1939 the regiment assembled at winnipeg and was despatched to england the patricias took part 
 in the invasion of sicily in july 1943 and continued to fight in the italian campaign until march 1945 when 
 they joined ist canadian army in the liberation of holland returning to canada in november of that year most of 
 the wartime veterans 0:veter 0:ans were released from service the remaining soldiers joined the 2nd battalion 0:battal 0:ion of the 
 regiment that had just been formed for service in the pacific theatre 0:thea 0:tre this battalion was soon incorporated into 
 the new post war army dropping 0:drop 0:ping the 2nd battalion designation and becoming princess patricia s canadian light infantry 
 with reorganization completed it was time to move from the manitoba base at camp mcdonald near portage la prairie on 
 june 10th 1946 a clear and sunny day the regiment came marching through the doors of the canadian pacific railway 
 station on calgary s 9th avenue 0:av 0:enue proudly led by the colour party bearing the cased king s and 
 regimental colours and protected by senior non commissioned officers with sloped rifles and bayonets fixed the men of princess patricia 
 s canadian light infantry had arrived in calgary to take up quarters in currie barracks their arrival would mark the 
 beginning of an association with calgary that would carry them into 1997 currie barracks in 1946 still bore the signs 
 of wartime expansion what had been large open areas in 1939 had been quickly filled with wartime construction 0:con 0:struction 
 of temporary accommodation and office buildings described as h huts because of their configuration the huts covered every available space 
 including most of the original parade square the patricias quickly settled into their new quarters and shakedown training 0:train 0:ing 
 was started in the sarcee training area culminating in the first post war exercise in the north west territories which 
 was part of the regiment s new mandate for protection of the alaska highway and the canadian northwest by 1947 
 new married quarters were being established and the regiment was finally settling into the city life of calgary in may 
 the regiment performed 
 the patrician 1997 5 the original main gate of currie barracks with the now long gone guardhouse the barracks were 
 named in honour of general sir arthur currie of wwi fame the gate will be preserved by the museum of 
 the regiments the ceremony of trooping the colour on the parade square at hmcs tecumseh the currie square being under 
 repair for the first time calgarians would witness this impressive ceremony where the regimental colour with the patricias wwi battle 
 honours was paraded through the ranks to serve as a reminder of past sacrifices made in battle the ceremony would 
 be performed many times in the years to come to delight audiences at currie barracks in july of that year 
 the patricias began a longstanding relationship with the calgary stampede and a float together with a marching contingent appeared 0:ap 
 0:peared at the annual parade for many years until the disbandment of the ppcli band in 1994 the annual parade 
 would be led by the scarlet uniformed musicians of the regiment provision of aid to the civil power has always 
 been a task that the military can be called upon to provide under the national defence act and in july 
 1947 calgary based patricias found themselves helping to save the rich farmlands 0:farm 0:lands in the fraser valley from floodwaters 
 the calgary soldiers were also instrumental in fighting the disastrous red river floods in southern manitoba in the springs of 
 both 1950 and 1997 as a result of new defence policy in 1948 the patricias were designated as an airborne 
 battalion and would be embodied in the newly formed mobile strike force to counter any aggression in the canadian north 
 soon the skies around calgary would blossom with parachutes as the unit practised their new found skills drop zones were 
 used on the airfield south of currie barracks at midnapore near the lacombe home and areas west of the city 
 in the spring of 1950 a mass jump was made at the calgary airport and the event was witnessed by 
 thousands of spectators 
 the patrician 1997 6 looking westward across crowchild trail to the currie barracks parade square and headquarters building circa 1950 
 signal hill is in the distant top right the relative peace of the post war era was soon to be 
 shattered on june 27th 1950 north korean communist forces attacked south korea and canada under the auspices of the united 
 nations agreed to the provision of armed forces to assist in what was called a un police action once again 
 currie barracks was in the forefront of preparations in august the patricias were authorized to raise a second battalion for 
 service with the newly created canadian 0:cana 0:dian army special force recruits hurried to calgary by train and bus to 
 join the new battalion and the barracks quickly filled up training swung into high gear and by early september the 
 second battalion had moved to wainwright to complete their training prior to embarkation for korea in november currie barracks would 
 continue as the home station for the paratrooptrained 0:paratroop 0:trained patricias now designated as first battalion in the late fall 
 of 1951 they would replace 2 ppcli in korea who would return and occupy currie barracks the fighting in korea 
 would not stop until the cease fire of july 1953 in the interim canada had incurred a further obligation in 
 1950 to provide troops for service in europe as part of the north atlantic treaty organization in the fall of 
 1953 the second battalion would leave currie barracks for service in germany 1 ppcli who had returned to calgary in 
 december 1952 would now have the barracks to themselves again the tours in germany were for two years and in 
 1955 the first battalion headed overseas to replace the second battalion who would reoccupy currie barracks the rapid expansion of 
 the canadian army in the 1950s to meet both the un korean and nato european commitments had raised more infantry 
 battalions 0:bat 0:talions than could be accommodated thus 2 ppcli and the regimental depot 
 7 moved to a new barracks in edmonton in the summer of 1957 currie barracks was now the home of 
 the queen s own rifles of canada qor of c who were to remain in the city throughout the sixties 
 until their announced redesignation as third battalion ppcli in 1969 qor of c now 3 ppcli moved to esquimalt bc 
 in 1970 in 1968 during the first battalion s tour in cyprus the rear party and all of the deployed 
 soldiers families moved back to currie barracks from their base in edmonton where they remained until 1997 calgary based patricias 
 have served several tours in cyprus croatia and bosnia and individuals have served on almost every united nations observer or 
 monitoring mission worldwide while patricia soldiers have been deployed calgarians have always been very forthcoming in their support for the 
 regiment 0:regi 0:ment and have shown demonstrable pride in its accomplishments in peacekeeping 0:peace 0:keeping and humanitarian assistance missions throughout 
 their stay in calgary the patricias acquired a taste of the friendliness 0:friend 0:liness and warmth of calgarians and some 
 have even been called cowboys they have carried the city s style of western hospitality across the seas to germany 
 0:ger 0:many during their nato service and to cyprus and yugoslavia during their un tours they have held pancake breakfasts 
 mini stampede celebrations and western style barbeques introducing calgary friendliness to other cultures the farewell to calgary ceremonies began with 
 a freedom of the city parade on june 11th 1997 followed by a military tattoo and open house on june 
 21st and the 1 ppcli change of command parade on july 10th this last parade saw ppcli association members who 
 arrived in currie barracks in 1946 push a wwii anti tank gun out the main gate of currie barracks as 
 a symbol of finality this 2500 pound gun was then taken over by serving members of 1 ppcli who pushed 
 it to the battalion s new home in edmonton currie barracks as home station of the regiment is no more 
 no longer will the parade square echo the barked commands and the sound of marching feet no longer will the 
 stirring sounds of military music fill the air and entertain 0:enter 0:tain civilian audiences gone are the students who attended 
 the schools gone are the wives who were employed in all aspects of society nurses and teachers librarians and secretaries 
 clerks and caregivers the mosaic of calgary has changed for those of us who remain and for calgarians all it 
 is a sad day a proud association established between the citizens of calgary and the regiment 0:regi 0:ment is but 
 a memory the only serving patricias remaining in calgary are those serving in 41 brigade headquarters or its calgary units

 the patrician 1997 13 message from the national president princess patricia s canadian light infantry association mr doug bedford cd 
 message from the president i would like to start off by saying how proud the association is of the regiment 
 for its hard work in the former yugoslavia and most recently for its relief efforts in quebec and eastern ontario 
 hit by the ice storm the membership of the association stands at approximately 850 members we are always striving to 
 improve the family ties between the regiment and the association it is only through the continuance and strengthening of our 
 mutual bonds of service that we can hope to create more interest and attract new association members one of our 
 more important roles is the big picture management of regimental museum operations this is done by the hamilton gault memorial 
 fund board of trustees 0:trus 0:tees over the past eight years the calgary branch has been running a casino and 
 have raised over 150 000 00 for museum coffers in addition other branches have been doing their own fundraising for 
 the benefit of the museum one shortcoming of the regiment s history is the post korean war era i appeal 
 to each and every one of you to go through your old boxes of memorabilia and donate photos letters and 
 other items of regimental significance to the museum we the museum can only tell the parts of our history that 
 we know and unless you play your part we will not know much the manitoba nw ontario branch have placed 
 a cairn at the old fort osborne barracks which was the home of the patricias in winnipeg following wwi the 
 cairn is now emplaced in front of the original headquarters building and will be ceremonially dedicated on june 30th 1998 
 by the branch and 2 ppcli a kingston group headed by lieutenant colonel pentney has requested authority to form another 
 branch of the association letters have gone out to all other branches seeking their approval and if granted we hope 
 to present the kingston branch s charter at the annual general meeting in ottawa 14 16 august 1998 for more 
 information on the agm contact myself or regimental headquarters the association has designed a pin to commemorate our first 50 
 years it is a replica of the first association crest and was very well received by the membership if you 
 are interested in obtaining one please give me a call the association members are proud and continue to stand tall 
 when we say we once served in the finest regiment in canada with your help and encouragement the collective we 
 will do all in our power to keep it the finest regiment in closing i wish you and your family

 refrain first the highlanders then the calgary regiment then the air command band the bands drowned out the distant thunder 
 as the troops stood silent the music rose to a crescendo the lightning died away as the bands slowly dropped 
 out one by one leaving the lone piper to play the last verse the last ray of sunset broke through

 the patrician 1997 38 summary of the history 260 th battalion canadian rifles canadian expeditionary force siberia perpetuated by the 
 princess patricia s canadian light infantry perpetuated by the princess patricia s canadian light infantry the 260 th battalion canadian 
 rifles canadian expeditionary force siberia 0:si 0:beria was one of the two infantry battalions within the 16th canadian infantry brigade 
 canadian siberian expeditionary force which was formed by an order 0:or 0:der in council on august 12th 1918 it was 
 part of an allied force of approximately 0:approxi 0:mately 118 000 soldiers commanded by a japanese general sent to siberia 
 to rescue the czech legion and to protect allied war material stockpiles in vladivostock from bolshevik capture in the later 
 stages of wwi the allies were shipping vast quantities of war materials to vladivostock on russia s east coast with 
 a view to enhancing support to russia s army in the war against the central powers germany austria hungary etc 
 russian railway problems however prevented almost all of the material from leaving the port city and forced its stockpiling with 
 the onset of the russian revolution in 1917 the tsar s army was withdrawn from the eastern front to battle 
 the bolsheviks many regular russian 0:rus 0:sian soldiers deserted to the bolsheviks and the czech brigade of the tsar s 
 army was no longer required for war service czech and slovak prisoners were released and joined with the czech brigade 
 to form the czech legion 60 000 strong the legion s only desire was to peacefully make its way eastward 
 0:east 0:ward across russia to north america and then to europe to establish an independent 0:inde 0:pendent state in their 
 homeland the provisional government allowed the legion to entrain at kiev and they began the journey to vladivostock due to 
 an incident along the route however a decree was issued to the effect that every armed legionnaire found along the 
 railway is to be shot on the spot this was in effect a declaration of war on the legion by 
 the bolsheviks during this period the allies were worried about the possibility of the stockpiled war materials at vladivostock falling 
 into bolshevik hands and eventually 0:even 0:tually reaching germany s arsenal simultaneously they were thinking about re opening the eastern 
 front due to being hard pressed in france and belgium 0:bel 0:gium initially the plan was for an allied force 
 approximately 100 000 strong to land at vladivostock and then with the czech legion and loyal russian forces travel westward 
 and reopen the eastern front thus relieving the pressure 0:pres 0:sure in france the threatening action by the bolsheviks against 
 the czech legion however made the protection of that group a priority closely followed 0:fol 0:lowed by safeguarding of the 
 stockpiles at vladivostock 
 the patrician 1997 39 sir robert borden the canadian prime minister saw the request for canadian 0:cana 0:dian troops by 
 britain as an opportunity to create intimate relations with that rapidly developing country russia and our interposition with a small 
 military force would tend to bring canada into favourable notice by the strongest 0:strong 0:est elements in that great community 
 borden was thinking about post war trading opportunities with the countries in the far east region the 260 th battalion 
 was comprised of 1026 all ranks 42 officers and 984 men under the command of lcol frederick jamieson the company 
 strengths were drawn from nova scotia and new brunswick a company manitoba b company saskatchewan and alberta c company and 
 british columbia d company of the total strength 520 men were drafted under the military service act and many had 
 seen previous wwi service with the ppcli the battalion formed over a two week period in october of 1918 at 
 willows camp in victoria and began training during this period the spanish influenza carried 0:car 0:ried by soldiers returning from 
 overseas spread like wildfire and on october 18th the 260 th battalion reported 180 men hospitalized with the virus in 
 terms of personal weapons the battalion members were initially issued the muchmaligned 0:much 0:maligned ross rifle however this was withdrawn 
 in favour of the british short magazine lee enfield smle on november 25th the battalion embarked on the ss protesliaus 
 at gordon head near victoria 0:victo 0:ria on december 26th 1918 and following a cold and stormy crossing arrived at 
 vladivostock on january 15th 1919 the sea weary men moved into the relative comfort of the recently renovated gournestai barracks 
 10 miles east of the city and posted guards at both east and second river barracks due to the lack 
 of clarification of the canadians mission and a growing reluctance by the government due to public pressure to send the 
 force westward 0:west 0:ward 2 680 miles to the area of omsk the men were kept busy doing company 0:com 
 0:pany battalion and even brigade level exercises over the barren frozen ground of the surrounding hills additionally calisthenics guard duty 
 and water carriage 0:car 0:riage were daily activities fortunately the ymca had the foresight to send a number of representatives 
 with the contingent these individuals organized dances and created cinemas and canteens in each barracks along with an eight team 
 hockey league boxing matches sports days with other allied contingents concerts by the roadhouse minstrels and others lectures and church 
 services 0:serv 0:ices the soldiers had plenty of activity to keep them busy during off duty hours other than small 
 parties of railway guards drawn from volunteers no formed group of the 260 th battalion left the vladivostock area during 
 their four months in theatre and no shots were fired in anger the last members of the canadian siberian expeditionary 
 force left vladivostock on 5 june 1919 each participating unit was later awarded the battle honour siberia 1918 19 however 
 the only unit having this emblazoned on their colours is the royal canadian mounted police which sent b squadron of

 was a soldier in the great war he enlisted when he was 48 years old and nearly blind in one 
 eye having fought in the boer war he quickly joined the princess patricia s canadian light infantry as an original 
 officer of the regiment in 1914 as a captain commanding no 2 company he first saw action in flanders at 
 st eloi in february 1915 he served continuously from 1915 to 1918 fought at ypres mount sorrel and the somme 
 he rose in rank to lieutenant colonel and commanded the regiment at vimy ridge and passchendaele he was severely wounded 
 once frezenberg 1915 and decorated with the distinguished service order by the king but agar adamson did more than fight 
 in the great war he recorded it in daily letters to his wife what he inadvertently produced was one of 
 the finest and most detailed personal accounts of the war what is also clear beyond the detail and the tragic 
 deaths of so many of his comrades is the emotional roller coaster that men of this period experienced agar started 
 with the enthusiasm so typical of 1914 full of king and empire but as the war progressed and the casualties 
 mounted adamson s spirit slowly declined he was under the constant strain of command had a seriously ill wife and 
 the perpetual nagging self doubt by 1918 adamson was exhausted both physically and emotionally he reluctantly relinquished command of that 
 he loved most his regiment as a historical document the letters of agar adamson stand on their own he was 
 not the brightest nor the best he was stout partially blind but he had compassion common sense and a true 
 sense of loyalty together he and his wife went to war in 1914 each striding off towards their own objectives 
 his frustrations and his love for his wife and life in general shine through like the rough diamond that was 
 agar adamson thanks to agar s second son anthony the letters are here for all to enjoy and to discover

 leo cooper hardcover 277 pages published price 37 95 available at the kitshopfor 31 50 though the book covers the 
 life or alexandei hamilton gault founder of the princess patricia s canadian light infantry the topical strength and half oi 
 the book s content is the formation of the regiment anc its participation in the great war it provides a 
 fascinating picture of the regiment and of the flesh and blood that made it so well known at the start 
 of the war gault not only paid for the raising of the regiment from his owr money but he was 
 insistent on providing for its welfare in the field unlike regimenta histories the faults the weaknesses and the sometimes pettiness 
 of individuals are on parade along with the strength the perseverance the duty and the courage ol its soldiers it 
 all makes for a story worth telling and jeffery williams does that withoui pulling the punches unlike most of today 
 s canadian pseudo icons gault gave true meaning to the words hero bravery responsibility and duty the originals valued him 
 as a leader of men and perhaps gave him the highest honour bestowed upon an officer he was considered one 
 of us it was his willingness to share the dangers of the trench and to take even greater personal risks 
 than themselves that endeared him to the men but jeffery williams has chronicled the life of a real man not 
 a hollywood hero gault s private life was deeply scarred by both tragedy and acrimony his bitter divorce during the 
 great war from his first wife marguerite affected him deeply the first cap badge of the regiment was designed with 
 the flower of the same name honouring her a symbol which later rankled him unmercifully severely wounded twice and losing 
 a leg at sanctuary wood in june 1916 gault continued to care nurture and love his regiment following the armistice 
 gault resumed command of his regiment and led them home to ottawa where they disbanded in march 1919 after the 
 war gault continued to serve his king and empire he was elected as a member of parliament for taunton somerset 
 for eleven years 1924 1935 he engaged in his passion of flying met adolph hitler and discovered the luftwaffe being 
 formed despite the versaille treaty when war broke out in 1939 gault was there to greet the regiment when they 
 arrived in england and looked out for their welfare he also joined the war effort and by 1942 was a 
 brigadier commanding the canadian reinforcement holding units in england he was appointed honorary lieutenant colonel of the regiment in december 
 1948 and then became the first colonel of the regiment in september 1958 the old soldier passed away on 28 
 november 1958 and is buried far away inside the ancient church beside hatch court somerset england alexander hamilton gault was 
 among the best and the last of a vanished breed in canadian history a true legend in his own time 
 
 62 the patrician 1997 third battalion princess patricia s canadian light infantry 1997 the year in review every year brings 
 forth different challenges and for the men and women of 3 ppcli 1997 was no different in that regard over 
 the course of the all too few 365 days that occurred in rapid succession deployments occurred on an almost continual 
 basis the battalion was to see two companies off to bosnia a deployment to flood ravaged manitoba a quick trip 
 to louisiana and many other activities that provided both challenge and reward to all members of the third herd a 
 company to bosnia op palladium a company para started the year in what some would term the only acceptable manner 
 deploying to north western bosnia and the town of zgon as b company of the 2 ppcli battle group under 
 the leadership of major hunt and the disciplined hand of csm brown the company spent six months patrolling 0:patrol 0:ling 
 along the inter entity boundary line and manning for a time the two main check points white fang and minstrel 
 boy while deployed these would be closed however while in use the two check points and their section houses provided 
 somewhat of a chance to escape the crowded warehouses in zgon sgt strader and the boys in bosnia 
 63 the patrician 1997 in addition to the men in the maroon berets zgon was filled up with the men 
 and women of the ldsh rc squadron the contingent s engineers and a wealth of administrative experts all dedicated to 
 providing the required level of support days and nights were filled with foot and vehicle patrols manning of check points

 real purpose was to see if the physical fitness level of the troops of the para company was really as 
 high as the reputation she had heard she was not disappointed the regimental day was celebrated by all occupants 0:occu

 practical joke pigden you fool get off the phone nevertheless once the orders authenticity was verified the unit sprang rapidly 
 into action after a hurried bugout and a few hasty o groups the battalion was ready to head eastwards to

 of winnipeg and the red river floodway ritchot tache and hanover this region lay directly east of the red river 
 and included some of the communities hardest hit by the flooding such as ste agathe ste adolphe and grande point 
 originally 2 ppcli s rear party had been working tirelessly in this area and our regimental brethren did an excellent 
 job at supporting and preparing us for the handover of responsibility while the advance party was busy expropriating the necessary 
 church basements town halls and hockey rinks to billet the troops the main body moved to shilo to stage the

 here they were assisted in their task by a steady stream of volunteers the bulk of which were hutterites from 
 a local colony unaffected by the flood c company was also billeted in he des chenes their tasks were primarily 
 to assist in dyke building operations and to conduct 0:con 0:duct a large number of security and evacuation patrols throughout 
 the inundated 0:inun 0:dated area the cold and dangerous water conditions often made these patrols gruelling but the maturity and 
 intelligence of the troops prevented many possible 0:pos 0:sible tragedies b company found itself working out of the village of 
 niverville carrying out patrols and assisting the locals in much the same manner as c company was doing in the

 the museum of the regiments was full of people many commenting on realism of the exhibit many of them were 
 retired or serving members most were nvinced that the apc had been cut in half and put against the wall

 region did not drown in the spring of 1997 in fact we found an extra patricia captain shanks he had 
 been hiding in aircom hq until his dike broke forcing him out into the open 1997 saw the retirements of 
 maj peterson mwo doug colton and wo don fry it also saw the release of wo perry batchelor and the 
 promotion of maj malcolm the bruce bruce no correlation the year ended with the establishment of the regional representatives thus 
 it gives the ere patricias an avenue for expressing their concerns such as why can t i be posted to

 it was watermanship training seriously our thanks goes out to all our fellow patricias who helped during the flood i

 the patrician 1997 109 ottawa area patricias more often than not the ottawa area patricias receive little mention in the 
 patrician perhaps this is because the officers and ncms in the national capital 0:capi 0:tal region are too busy to 
 report on their regimental activities more likely no self respecting patricia would want to brag about working so far away 
 from the army of the west whatever reason this past year has seen some significant events within our patricia community 
 which should not go unmentioned in september colonel glenn nordick took over as the local regimental representative from colonel don 
 dalziel in october we saw the arrival of lieutenant general ray crabbe to assume the duties of dcds and senior 
 serving patricia november 11th saw an impressive turnout of serving retired and associate 0:associ 0:ate members of the regiment at 
 lansdowne park for the traditional wreath laying ceremony at the preceding reception the colonel of the regiment mgen bill hewson 
 gave a regimental update and took opportunity to announce 0:an 0:nounce the appointment of lieutenant colonel matt overton as the 
 commanding officer designate of the second battalion and lieutenant colonel dave barr as commanding officer designate of the third battalion 
 more recently it was also announced that lieutenant colonel ernie reumiller will take over as commanding 0:com 0:manding officer of

 changes the patricias at cflrs look forward to once again setting the standard for both recruit and leadership instruction working

 the patrician 1997 112 un patricia chez les castors the odyssey began in the summer of 1996 faced with the 
 daunting task of operating in my second language i packed up my kit and headed off to la belle province 
 i quickly found much to my surprise that the van doos aside from the language were not much different from 
 our own regiment my first challenge met me face on when i learned that i was to begin my exchange 
 in a staff job now these sorts of positions are not necessarily the most sought after among junior officers in 
 the infantry add to this the fact that i was to undertake this position in french a language which i 
 hadn t studied for over four years and the expression defi de taille takes on a whole new meaning i 
 m not entirely sure who suffered more myself struggling in french or those poor van doos who had to decipher 
 what i was saying i think the latter nevertheless i undertook my new job as assistant operations officer with all 
 the zeal a confused anglophone junior officer could muster during ex roughish gator with 3rd us sfg while acting as 
 ops o sounds like a great plan mon colonel the americans seem pretty impressed too the only problem is i 
 think they like me only understood the english part of it 
 the patrician 1997 113 1997 began with the annual winter indoctrination exercise ex rafale blanche snow and cold temperatures are 
 pretty much the same everywhere save for the fact that the quebec region received an ungodly amount of snow last 
 winter everyone kept reassuring me that it was not the norm but i suspect their motives we followed that with 
 the annual brigade winter games jeux d hiver which mirrors ex strong contender in every respect next came preparations for 
 a patrolling competition competition bernatchez which was abruptly interrupted by a call out to assist with operation assistance in winnipeg 
 0:winni 0:peg the second battalion r22er joined other flood fighters from 1 cmbg and later 2 cmbg to help rescue 
 winnipeg from the red sea the operation as most patricias already know was a great success and it gave me 
 an opportunity 0:oppor 0:tunity to see some of the folks from the army of the west the battalion returned to 
 quebec in time to conduct ex bernatchez though without all the bells and whistles we had expected this was followed 
 by preparations for the deployment on operation constable the united nations transition mission in haiti untmih which included a battalion 
 reshuffle as only 42 of the battalion was slated to deploy i found myself in my current job 2ic d 
 coy and we began with the standard pre deployment administration 0:administra 0:tion we also managed summer leave before work up 
 training this training was similar to home save for the convenience of having the whole brigade in one location there 
 are some advantages to such a system as units with recent in theatre experience were on hand to assist with 
 the planning initial training conduct and evaluation of exercises the end of september arrived and with a final farewell to 
 our families we embarked for haiti the pre deployment preparations had been fraught with difficulties due to the uncertainty of 
 the mission mandate including its potential termination date this affected everything from the training to the leave plan in spite 
 of this uncertainty the canadian contingent deployed with the intent of spending the next six months basking er sweating it 
 out in the haitian climate as it turned out the mandate lasted only two months with the contingent deployed for 
 a three month period the untmih was replaced by the united nations police observer mission in haiti unpomih our operations 
 were limited to patrolling for the first month to gain familiarity with the terrain and the local populace humanitarian assistance 
 for the second month and packing 0:pack 0:ing up the mission during the third and final month while many of 
 the participants 0:partici 0:pants left thinking boy that was nothing like yugo actually they thought in french but you get 
 the idea we did gain a new perspective of the situation in that troubled nation the past 18 months with 
 our quebec brethren has been an interesting and edifying experience and no doubt the next 18 months will prove to 
 be just as invaluable capt rory fowler ppcli exchange officer with 2e r22er

 the patrician 1997 115 two patricias with unikom the united nations iraq kuwait observer mission unikom was established 0:estab 0:lished 
 at the end of the gulf war by security council resolution 687 on 3 april 1991 the mandate of the 
 mission is to monitor the demilitarized zone between 0:be 0:tween iraq and kuwait and deter any hostile or potentially hostile 
 action mounted from the territory of one state towards the other canada s contribution 0:contribu 0:tion to unikom is four 
 military observers presently our regiment contributes 0:contrib 0:utes half that strength having sent the ex deputy commanding officer of 3 
 ppcli major joe pollock and the ex regimental adjutant capt bill lewis to the demilitarized zone dmz in july of 
 1997 the mission is not large by un standards the force is comprised of 195 unarmed military observers representing 32 
 nations they are supported by a bangladeshi mechanized infantry battalion a troop of argentinean engineers an austrian logistics company and 
 a small medical unit of civilian paramedics nurses and doctors from germany additionally a helicopter unit also from bangladesh provides 
 an air surveillance capability and a much needed medevac service the total strength of unikom is 1 075 the dmz 
 extends 10 km into iraq and 5 km into kuwait and runs approximately 0:ap 0:proximately 200 kilometres from north to 
 south surveillance is achieved from sixteen desert patrol observation bases pobs each manned by seven un unarmed military observers unmos 
 these pobs also provide the observers 0:observ 0:ers for the two daily helicopter air reconnaissances in the interest of command 
 0:com 0:mand and control the dmz is organized into a north and south sector unikom hq is established within the 
 dmz at umm qasr iraq in a former iraqi naval hospital support elements of the force are accommodated in camp 
 khor kuwait three kms south in what was also an iraqi naval facility an interesting 0:interest 0:ing aside is that 
 the accommodation referred to locally as containers are atco huts manufactured in calgary although the mission is relatively quiet in 
 terms of hostile military violations 0:viola 0:tions there are many potential hazards that demand our attention primary among these are 
 the numerous and various types of unexploded ordinance uxo which litter the dmz uxo accounts for casualties on a weekly 
 basis the biggest threat is the cluster bomblets and surface laid mines iraqi children are normally the victims of these 
 seemingly innocent looking devices not knowing 0:know 0:ing the threat many toddlers and even adults fall prey to the temptation 
 0:tempta 0:tion to pick up a strange looking piece of metal if they avoid death they are normally badly disfigured 
 or left with missing limbs in december three iraqi policemen determined that they would rid their police post area of 
 this nuisance 0:nui 0:sance they were able to collect a considerable pile of the black hand ball size objects bomblets 
 and foolishly lit a bonfire to destroy them 
 116 he patrician 199 on the road to baghdad the resulting explosion grievously injured all three of the police first 
 on the scene of the carnage was the patrol from the nearby pob the unmos applied first aid while summoning 
 the medevac chopper their efforts were in vain as the three policemen all succumbed to their wounds it was just 
 one of the ten average monthly medevacs that the bangladesh pilots must respond to the desert is a harsh enough 
 environment without uxo summer afternoon 0:after 0:noon temperatures normally exceed 55 c and it may cool at night to 35 
 c the hottest temperature was recorded three years ago 62 c beginning in april the south wind sharqi is constant 
 and can gust to 80 kph from mid june to mid september the northerly shamal wind blows steadily at 30 
 40 kph carrying 0:car 0:rying dust and sand so that the landscape is obscured by mid afternoon sandstorms 0:sand 0:storms 
 occur at least twice a week the windscreens of the patrol vehicles are pitted and blasted by the relentless 0:re 
 0:lentless sand making night driving considerably more challenging new observers 0:ob 0:servers also quickly learn that opening a vehicle door 
 downwind will usually result in several hundred dollars damage to the vehicle as the door hinges snap with the force 
 of the wind and the car body suffers dents from the flapping door the winds do nothing to decrease the 
 heat 
 117 the patrician 1991 perhaps the most disconcerting natural threat on the desert is the wide and plentiful variety of 
 snakes spiders and insects all species from the first two groups are deemed poisonous and most from the latter are 
 just plain overgrown 0:over 0:grown and ugly despite not being venomous snakes are to be avoided as a bite can 
 prove fatal unless professional medical help can be obtained notably the first aid for snakebite dictates that the bite area 
 should be packed in ice since there are not many freezer stops on the patrol routes it s best to 
 stay alert to avoid the requirement to use ice staying alert is tough in the excessive heat regarding arachnids the 
 desert has your basic black and yellow varieties of scorpions and they are in both cases numerous a british unmo 
 killed a black scorpion approaching canner lobster size which was allowed to feed unmolested for several months at the bottom 
 of the bunker in november five pob a chinese unmo at sierra six pob regularly collects the smaller yellow scorpions 
 to make a stir fry which he claims is good for his blood pressure a french unmo captured all varieties 
 of the eight legged beasts and kept them alive in his room it s therefore not surprising that he contracted 
 a mysterious malady of the nervous system whereby he lost the feeling in his hands and was hospitalized for a 
 two month period if you re arachnophobic your worst nightmare is the camel spider camel spiders are brown at least 
 as big as your hand move at incredible speed and can jump and climb like batman they re too ugly 
 to be displayed with the tarantulas in a canadian pet store the feature that immediately identifies them from all other 
 big brown bold spiders is the two legs or arms that dangle in front of them as they gallop over 
 the terrain depending on whom you listen too it is said that they are called camel spiders because they have 
 a hump and are brown that s believable it is preferable for threat assessment purposes not to put much stock 
 in the tale that the spiders are so named because they can fasten to a camel s neck with their 
 hook arms inject anaesthesia instead of venom and then slowly feast off the unwitting animal sometimes killing it we should 
 also be skeptical about the story told by a danish unmo who related that one of his countrymen had his 
 nose eaten by a camel spider while he slept the climate the fauna and the uxo are all basic health 
 hazards but most can be guarded against lawless banditry however is prevalent in the iraqi desert and it is a 
 serious threat to an unmo s well being bandits fall into several categories whiskey bandits are the most sophisticated smuggling 
 whiskey through the dmz from iraq to dry kuwait is a lucrative business with fake johnny walker red label worth 
 160 00 us a bottle of course smugglers usually have guns and they don t like their nighttime operations compromised 
 thus unmo night patrols are wary of surprising whiskey convoys 0:con 0:voys on the plus side it can be said 
 that smugglers and whiskey bandits are for the most part nonviolent if left alone to practice their trade the same 
 cannot be said of raiders twice in the past three years raiding bandits have struck november five pob stripping it 
 of valuables and 
 118 the patrician 1997 leaving numerous bullet holes in the atco huts as a reminder of their visits the observers 
 on duty were unharmed perhaps because they were unarmed 0:un 0:armed and did not offer resistance two years ago three 
 soldiers on patrol from the bangladesh battalion were less lucky when they were shot during a vehicle hijacking on the 
 baghdad highway close by november five the soldiers 0:sol 0:diers were armed and offered resistance most recently on 18 feb 
 98 raiders hijacked the night patrol vehicle from november seven pob at gunpoint the italian and polish unmos in their 
 toyota land cruiser did not resist and a sabot round gulf war silver bullet entered this t 62from the rear 
 the tanks sits at a crossroads in saffwan a short distance from the site where the ceasefire agreement between iraq 
 and the coalition was signed in march 1991 capt bill lewis and maj foe pollock as the un heroes this 
 panoramic shows two of the hundreds of destroyed iraqi armoured vehicles which still litter the desert the fires in the 
 background spew black smoke constantly from the centre of the iraqi oilfields close by november six pob 
 the patrician 1997 119 again being unarmed and non threatening they were let go when their vehicle containing maps binos 
 gps radios and nvd was driven north they followed the patrol road for 10 kms on foot to report the 
 incident at the nearest pob november five bandits with murderous intentions are also visitors to the dmz on the early 
 evening of 18 nov 97 four unmos at november four were getting ready for the evening meal at 1755 hrs 
 automatic rifle and lmg fire began to penetrate 0:pen 0:etrate the pob perimeter fired from a moving vehicle on the 
 basra highway fifty meters away all four atco huts in the compound along with the water tanks generator shed and 
 observation tower were hit at lethal height the fijian unmo in the ops room saw several bullets penetrate the walls 
 at waist level and exit through the other side destroying the satellite receiver the thai unmo preparing dinner in the 
 kitchen had his supper literally shot from the stove the singaporean also in the kitchen watched rounds penetrate five stacked 
 metal chairs next to him and exit the far wall not so lucky was james adamu koto from ghana who 
 was taking a shower he was struck in the hip by a round that was partially spent after going through 
 the shower faucet when the shooting stopped his pob mates applied first aid and james was successfully treated after his 
 medavac to kuwait city ironically james had survived two tours with the un force in lebanon unifil including the 1982 
 israeli invasion and a tour in rwanda unimir during the tribal slaughters of 1994 5 without a scratch the plus 
 side of all of this is the advantage of working beside officers and soldiers from asia europe south and north 
 america as well as africa on a daily basis surely there is no better opportunity to experience the commonality of 
 military service where else would it be possible to see a greek and turk sit together and share stories at 
 an evening dinner on a pob the food has been cooked by a brit and served by an argentinean after 
 the meal the indian is washing the dishes and the pakistani is drying on the speaker in the kitchen container 
 are the voices of a russian and chinese unmos on patrol together animosities are forgotten in the common cause even 
 for us two or too old patricias with almost sixty years of combined service twelve total peacekeeping missions and more 
 war stories than we would admit to it is a new and worthwhile experience it can all be explained quite 
 simply in the arab parable a scorpion was on the west bank of the jordan river and he wished to 
 cross to the east realizing he could not swim he approached a frog on the bank and asked for a 
 ride the frog knowing the reputation of scorpions declined saying you are treacherous and will sting me in the middle 
 of the river and i will drown the scorpion however convinced the frog by pointing out that since he couldn 
 t swim he would drown along with the frog if he stung him that was logical and so the frog 
 gave the scorpion a ride half way across the river the scorpion decided to sting the frog as he was 
 sinking the frog looked back and said why did you sting me now both of us will drown the scorpion 
 replied who knows this is the middle east

 the associated move of the first battalion and the regimental home station also had its effect a large percentage of 
 our members spent at least part of the summer travelling matt and liz brown were the most ambitious as they 
 drove all the way to the east coast and back bob and phil shine took their usual trip back to

 were the roes and felix carriere both men spent time in hospital for surgery both are ok now fred hart

 in may the aircraft captain announced that we were flying over wainwright at the risk of offending wally komadina i 
 will paraphrase the prime minister of australia who said the best way to see darwin australian city is from thirty 
 thousand 0:thou 0:sand feet on your way to paris i think the best way to see wainwright is from thirty

 124 the patrician 1997 okanagan thompson branch princess patricia s canadian light infantry association the okanagan thompson branch s contribution 
 to the patrician consists of a brief history of the branch from its formation in 1983 84 to the present 
 the idea of establishing a branch in the okanagan area was the brainchild of the late vince lilly then national 
 association president the word was spread throughout the valley inviting all patricias and their wives to a gathering at vernon 
 military camp on 10 july 1983 through the efforts of lcol don ardelian the camp co a dinner was arranged 
 at the officer s mess it was through discussions at this event that it was agreed that a branch should 
 be formed on 23 june 1984 at the next dinner our first executive was elected with vince lilly as president 
 and don ardelian as ist vice lady patricia first visited us on 7 october 1985 for tea at the vernon 
 armoury at a 75th anniversary planning meeting in 1985 it was decided that a memorial cairn be constructed on camp 
 property to honour all patricias serving 0:serv 0:ing there over the years construction was approved and we planted several maple 
 trees under the watchful eye of lcol brian munro the new camp co actual construction began in early spring 1988 
 and was completed in june 1989 with the finishing touches on the patricia way and the planting of flowers 0:flow 
 0:ers unfortunately vince lilly did not live to see the completion of his dream looking down patricia way towards the 
 cairn 
 the patrician 1997 125 a close up of the cairn due to his untimely death on 23 october 1988 the 
 dedication of the cairn took place on 22 july 1989 with the honour guard and corps of drums being provided 
 by 3 ppcli and with major genera c b ware performing the unveiling 0:un 0:veiling the prayer of dedication was 
 read by the battalion padre lady patricia again visited the branch on 24 may 1990 and laid a spray of 
 flowers at the base of the cairn at the 6th annual branch meeting in 1989 tom tyson was elected president 
 0:presi 0:dent and due to a lack of willing candidates his term of office was extended well beyond the normal 
 period until 14 june 1997 the branch was privileged to host the 45th annual general meeting of the ppcli association 
 from 4 6 june 1993 at vernon military camp and regularly celebrates regimental day minus the broom i loo frezenberg 
 day san fortunato day and kapyong day membership in the branch has increased gradually from the original 25 to the

 the patrician 1997 129 calgary branch princess patricia s canadian light infantry association here we are in 1998 and the 
 changes continue on the calgary news last week they showed harvey barracks being demolished it was hard to watch the 
 rumour mill has it that currie barracks has been declared a historical site this includes the patricia lines they plan 
 to dig the parade square down about three feet and grass it turning it into a park a little bird 
 has said that a restaurant has bought the officers mess the pmqs are being rented out with some problems arising 
 i e health concerns about insulation we will keep you up to date on the changes with each newsletter the 
 calgary branch has kept itself busy with a few gatherings since the last newsletter we have had our golf tournament 
 which was held september 27th the golf course had a sign that asked that you pay fifty cents a game 
 the father of don munro one of our branch members put this there in the 19205 we had a very 
 slow start the day was sunny but the wind in carstairs was something else it was not really cold but 
 it was blowing like a gale off the coast of newfoundland putting was easy if you were going with the 
 wind john demerchant presents matt hall his prize as the top golfer in the calgary branch golf tournament 
 the patrician 1997 130 all that you had to do was stand there and the wind blew your ball into 
 the hole the last group finished after 1900 hours most of us were extremely tired after playing eighteen holes except 
 heinz keese heinz was smarter than the rest of us and would leave a club behind at different holes so 
 his bag was much lighter by the end of the game but the look on his face when he realized 
 that he would have to go after them was something to see our top golfer was mat hall i thought 
 i had that one because i had the highest score about 198 strokes not bad hey john demerchant and i 
 attended the agm in saskatoon along with about a dozen members from the calgary branch during the august long weekend 
 the saskatchewan branch put on a great show and all of us had a good time meeting old friends and 
 making new ones we saw don vardy who stopped in for a short visit and is doing extremely well as 
 a cabinetmaker the weekend 0:week 0:end went by all too quickly and we had a very pleasant drive home on 
 one of those rare perfect summer days rod middleton is presently working on the book of remembrance if you know 
 of a patricia who died while serving with the regiment but not on active duty please pass on the information 
 to regimental headquarters rod thanks for your hard work and dedication the calgary branch held its second annual octoberfest friday

 the patrician 1997 132 manitoba nw ontario branch princess patricia s canadian light infantry association the river has subsided the 
 sandbags have disappeared and over 8 000 armed forces personnel who assisted the citizens of manitoba in their desperate 0:desper 
 0:ate battle with the red sea have returned to their home bases as far as we know none of our 
 members were directly affected by the flood but many of us were involved in assisting friends and relatives in the 
 flooded and threatened 0:threat 0:ened areas and the branch donated 500 00 to the salvation army we care flood relief 
 fund many manitobans whose homes were destroyed or badly damaged are now engaged in another battle with various levels of 
 government over compensation for their losses some were not able to rebuild their homes before this winter but for most 
 of us life has returned to normal the apcs and assault boats have disappeared from our streets and waterways but 
 they will be long remembered by thousands of grateful citizens a local artist has memorialized our recurring war with the 
 red with a large mural on an exterior wall of the saint vital curling club depicting flood fighting operations in 
 the area from 1776 to 1997 where canadian forces personnel regular and militia are prominently portrayed working shoulder to shoulder 
 with the local civilians 0:civil 0:ians in their desperate battles with the red and assiniboine rivers as the floodwater receded 
 a few of our branch members got involved with the winnipeg ppcli cadets and their annual fund raiser helping them 
 deliver 15 000 sets of phone books for manitoba telecom services many of these cadets proudly sported the regimental t 
 shirts they had proudly worn working on the dikes a few weeks earlier our next big event was the return 
 of the second battalion from bosnia where they had served with distinction and remarkably without losing a single 0:sin 0:gle 
 person we celebrated the event by attending a welcome home barbecue 0:barbe 0:cue in the wos and sgts mess a 
 few of their members were mugged out on posting or retirement and branch president jerry franc presented an association 0:associa 
 0:tion certificate of appreciation to mwo darby whitebone csm of second battalion s rear party who went more than the 
 extra mile in support of our branch while the battalion was away in bosnia although not quite on the scale 
 of the flood of the century the branch s eleventh annual golf tournament was our second disaster of the year 
 twentytwo 0:twenty 0:two golfers from the association the wos sgts mess and the jr ranks club bravely teed off in 
 a rainstorm that developed into a torrential downpour accompanied by gale force winds five hardy souls actually completed 18 holes 
 probably because they couldn t find a shortcut back to the clubhouse 
 the patrician 1997 133 but most quit after the first nine and a few didn t make it that far 
 suffering from hypothermia and trenchfoot we all retired to the junior ranks club where a little liquid refreshment and an 
 excellent barbecue restored our spirits 0:spir 0:its because most teams did not complete the game there was no equitable way 
 of scoring so the trophies were not awarded on the sth of september quietly and without ceremony our long awaited 
 memorial see photo was erected on the grounds of the former fort osborne barracks now known as the asper jewish 
 community campus erected to mark the regiment s occupation of fort osborne barracks between the two world wars the monument

 the patrician 1997 140 in memoriam major retired r f s robertson mc 1918 1997 it is with sadness that 
 the regiment learned of the passing of major retired robert frank struan robertson mc on may 18th 1997 following schooling 
 at victoria and übc 0:ubc major robertson joined the ppcli in 1940 and served the regiment into 1945 in the villa 
 rogatti operation on 6 december 1943 then acting captain robertson was in command of b company at midnight his company 
 led the regiment down to and across the moro river at the beginning of this silent attack following the unopposed 
 crossing the company came under machine gun fire captain robertson swiftly made his dispositions he determined to break through the 
 enemy outpost line on the left flank using bren guns and two inch mortars firing in flat trajectory two platoons 
 sped to the attack by now the main enemy garrison in villa rogatti was aroused there was firing in every 
 direction but for the most part on fixed lines and so easily avoided the main difficulty was to pinpoint or 
 identify the enemy weapon pits and fortified houses firefights continued for more than four hours and it was dawn before 
 b company had made good its ground and had reached the tiny square of the village captain robertson split his 
 men up into small groups and ordered them to winkle out the defenders prisoners were taken rubbing the sleep from 
 their eyes in a number of houses breakfast stood on the tables the enemy had not taken the first assault 
 seriously 1 in the early afternoon following an artillery barrage on villa rogatti a german counterattack consisting of nine mark 
 iv tanks and an infantry escort burst from cover of the olive groves and swept against the patricias the attack 
 fell upon b company 0:com 0:pany in two thrusts the enemy tanks raking the patricia positions while small groups of 
 infantry dashed against the outlying posts b company stood firm and met the attack grandly with captain robertson moving about 
 in the open under heavy fire to direct his men for two hours sharp fighting continued five attempts to pierce 
 b company s front failed 2 between the forward two companies 40 prisoners and a number of mortars machine guns 
 and an anti tank gun were captured in the enemy counterattack captain robertson was awarded the military cross for his 
 leadership and gallantry in the villa rogatti operation on december 6th 1943 the following day captain robertson was injured having 
 rejoined the regiment as adjutant captain robertson was injured again on august 31st 1944 at the foglia river on the 
 gothic line following the war he received a phd in chemistry and was employed by atomic energy canada at chalk 
 river and the whiteshell nuclear research establishment his last government appointment was as the nuclear liaison officer to nato in 
 paris he retired to saltspring island in 1976 and will be missed by many patricias 1 princess patricia s canadian
