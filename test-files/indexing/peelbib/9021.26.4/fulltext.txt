 possible the colonel arrived that evening and on the following morning the force commenced the march hack to fort pitt
 the infantry marched as far as frog creek arriving there at 10 p m in a downpour of rain the

 were peremptory so that we had to push on at frog creek the good ship north west was waiting for

 to other causes i cannot say the lake is over 20 miles in length and about 17 miles in width
 it is surrounded by a sand and pebble beach and its banks are thickly wooded with pines of large growth
 it is a beautiful spot and the surrounding country is magnificent pasture land the peavine and vetch and grasses on
 the 20 th of june covering the horses knees everything that man could desire may be found in this favoured
 place its sole population being a few chipewyan indians the appearance of many of the young trees being barked by
 rabbits not above a half a foot from the ground would show that the snowfall in winter cannot be very
 deep if only a sufficient number of families would settle here so as to form a colony and thus afford
 social intercourse i know no more desirable place on the earth to settle in the country will ere long be
 opened up by a railway and this favoured region will be no doubt one day thickly inhabited word came in

 his trouble later on however he jumped on jumbo suddenly and pulled him over on the floor and about a
 dozen salvationists seized and succeeded in ejecting him as well as baby they were not at all pleased with such
 treatment and jumbo most unceremoniously kicked in the door and defied them to put him out again his invitation was
 not accepted notwithstanding that he took a seat and waited their pleasure finally tiring of the monotony he went outside

 who had preceded us from on we went again this time into a val england two years earlier ley where
 a row of miners shacks stood then we looked up and there he was not far from a river one
 of these shacks our dada he stood there wearing a broad was to be our temporary home it was brimmed

 the outside and unboarded on the inside the train down the line possibly at lethbridge walls were hung with chains

 for many following when is this big field going to end days we were busy getting to know our new
 environment one of the first things having been brought up in the victorian we had to do was to learn
 to combat the tradition of manners we knew that we should be seen but not heard but it seemed flies
 they were everywhere coming from the temperate climate of england we had utterly fantastic to us that there were no
 not been molested by such hordes the hedges or stone walls little shack didn t boast the blessing of soon
 we came to a big house where we screens so dada had done his best with the were ushered into
 a room in which a table aid of fly pads and fly papers the pads was laid for breakfast vera
 and i looked were small plate sized discs of grey blotaround the rough wooden partitions with ting type paper with
 an explanatory and 2 x 4 s showing didn t even reach to the cautionary message encircled in the centre
 ceiling but there was an aproned maid they came in a package and as the need tending to our wants
 marvellous we arose one was withdrawn placed on a plate whispered to one another was this going and covered with
 water the paper absorbto be our new way of life we learned later that we had been breakfasted in a
 private the author of these reminiscences is the dining room of the mine cook house later daughter of william addie
 who was still we learned to look forward to a visit employed in 1904 by the breckenridge to the kitchen

 these sheets came we used the back door almost exclusively in pairs sticky sides together and they had so that
 the front door for us was neglected to be separated before being placed on a and rorgotten surface or pinned
 to a wall where they stay inside there was a kitchen dining room ed till one could hardly see the
 goo for the drawing room and two bedrooms in the trapped flies one difference between the floor of the kitchen
 was a little trap door result of these two types of traps was that and we were duly warned of
 the danger the former provided a silent death but on it posed to the unwary it led to the cellar
 the latter the poor victims complained and where there was some monster of a heating struggled to release themselves only

 some frights were the victims of acci vera and me waiting impatiently hopping dents and viewed what went on around
 us round on the sunbaked earth that formed with an acceptance that astonishes i was the patio in front of
 the door we climbed the elder and took responsibility for my in mama and dada sat in front and vera
 little sister in many ways for example and i perched on the back seat and perch when vera went to
 the w c it was my ed it was for when one had climbed on the duty to attend we
 wore what were called pedal to the floor board and up to the seat closed knickers which meant that the
 drawit felt very far from the ground indeed the ers had a drop seat and were fastened to road was
 rough and rutted and many times the waist band by buttons on either side we thought we were going to
 be spilled on often i wandered off but not far and to the grass mama was very nervous and was
 recalled to fasten buttons when i heard so many times did she exclaim good law the summons mayah i m
 ready tucked will that i am sure our ride was shorter in bed at night i couldn t go to
 sleep withthan it might have been out repeating my self imposed litany vera at last our house was ready it
 stood on are you warm enough comfortable and am an elevation of ground looking down to i hurting you i
 rarely received a reply to wards the railway lines and beyond to the this for vera was a sleepy head
 and alriver valley it was a box like building ready in the land of nod painted white the back door
 boasted a we watched for the indians who were few steps and to the west of these was an to
 us one of the first of the strange phenooutside entrance to the cellar nearby stood mena that we encountered in
 the new world the water barrel and at a discreet distance there was a reserve not far from us and
 1 the author at right is seen with her sister vera from time to time it seemed that the whole
 band accompanied by ponies and dogs would file past our house on the way to town they appeared to look
 neither to right nor left but kept to the trail with an all engrossing sense of purpose some ponies drew
 a travois while women carried papooses in moss bags on their backs which seemed to us a very strange place
 indeed we felt fear only if we were alone when the cavalcade went by and then i would take vera
 s hand and together we would duck beneath the dining room table pulling the chenille table cover down to the
 floor on the window side of the room to shield ourselves sometimes on the return trip the chief would come
 to the kitchen door and ask for bread or cake once mama gave him half a loaf and several joints
 of ox tail which she happened to have simmering on the stove these he accepted with alacrity and moved on
 we watched him eat the meat and hand the bread to his wife who was waiting nearby i remember his
 tall stately figure deeply furrowed face his black braids interwoven with leather thongs his felt hat beaded jacket and moccasins
 he walked with a peculiar side way step which was the result so i thought of longpractised noiseless movement sometimes
 we were in the general store in lundbreck when indian women were buying calico to make their voluminous skirts they
 leaned over the counter chattering to one another and feeling the cloth as our mama did when buying material for
 our dresses somehow we always thought that such an episode was worthy of report when we were home again we
 had no playmates so we depended entirely upon one another for companionship inside we played with our toys books and
 dolls and outside was the wonderful stone pile there were stones of many sizes but very few that we couldn
 t lift and move to make whatever we chose on any particular day as we dropped them in place they
 made a clacking noise and i am sure that these oft repeated sounds must have assured our mama that the
 children were still playing close by how tired we must have been after manoeuvering rocks into place to build walls
 sufficiently high to suggest rooms in a house in the corner of the playhouse kitchen we built a fireplace on
 which we concocted many a brew of twigs leaves and bits of grass although we played together a great deal
 there were times when we followed our own whims and fancies i remember a lady who lived in one of
 the mine cottages i think her name was foster she amused herself by making small photo frames from pieces of
 cardboard bound together by a silky fancywork thread she gave me a lesson and soon after i visited her again
 to show her what i had accomplished good for you she said in tones that i am sure were intended
 to be words of commendation however it was an expression with which i was not familiar and my interpretation was
 that she thought my frame was really the best she could expect from a backward child like me i ran
 home in tears and mama s attempted explanation did not erase my first impression of good for you on other
 occasions i liked to wander off alone to make discoveries one sunny day i strolled up and along the south
 hills the air was soft and warm and full of insect voices wild flowers grew abundantly amid the news and
 were told that the warm wind the grass i called the blue ones forget me was called a chinook and
 that it often nots and gathered a few lying saucered swept across southern alberta with its ovenin the earth of
 the hillside was a huge stone like breath a granite boulder where perhaps the buf pets were added to our
 family when we falo used to scratch their hides the grass came to live in canada i had been promisedging
 the depression seemed to grow a ed a pony and vera a puppy and early in little taller like a
 trimming of fringe the the spring of 1906 dada came home one stone was lovely and pink with shiny bits
 day with a pup he was a jolly little fat of something winking in the sun it was ball of
 yellow and white fur and everyone pleasantly rough to the touch as i ran my so loved our roy that
 we readily forgave hands over the surface i sat down and his misdemeanours that resulted in torn leaned my back
 against it its warmth pene hose and chewed shoes the teamster who trated my dress and seemed to enfold me
 drove the water tank to fill our barrel used the sun shone the insects buzzed the sky to send the
 little dog into paroysms of dewas as blue as the flowers that lay in my light by snapping his fingers
 and repeating lap i was alone and completely happy purp purp purp in soft guttural tones a component of the
 universe that seemed to mesmerize one day i was in the meantime vera had probably been down at the river
 sailing a rough little boat playing with her dolls she enjoyed such i had made suddenly the boat drifted begames
 more than i little realist that i was yond my reach and wildly wringing my i couldn t see the
 point of calling a doll a hands i cried get it roy get it roy in baby especially since it
 had long curly an instinctive response to my distress the hair and an outfit suitable for a four year little
 fellow stretchedhis neck and body old i was delighted when the wig came and retrieved my precious toy off mine
 and ran to show mama that now it was an exciting day when we drove my dolly looked like a
 real baby to cowley a town about five miles away another pastime which filled part of where the indians were
 holding a fair dada those mornings occurred when dada had hoped to buy a pony for me i soon spied
 to go down into the mine himself we would one that i liked a plump little buckskin try to judge
 under just what spot he was but the indian boy wouldn t sell and apt to be then lie down
 on our tummies to emphasize his no he leaned down and put our mouths to the ground cupped in affectionately
 put his arm round the horse s our hands and call hello dada here we neck the only other choice
 was a young are mavis and vera can you hear us sorrel that hadn t been broken to the saddle
 and this we did over and over again each but was very gentle so for 15 i became time moving
 to a new spot at the noon the owner of a two year old mare we made hour our first
 thought would be to ask if the return trip with bessie trotting along dada had heard us with a twinkle
 in his behind the buggy eye he would say that he thought he did that was the beginning of my
 days of hear the voices of his two little girls and horsemanship bessie was tethered beside we were satisfied the
 house where everyone in passing would a canadian winter was a new experience talk to her and stroke her dark
 neck and we had seen snow in england of course she soon learned to look for the lump of but
 only the kind that became slush almost sugar that frequently accompanied these as soon as it hit the ground now
 the abun caresses then one day dada strapped a dance of this dry white stuff was a joy in cushion
 to her back and before long i sat itself what fun we had wallowing in its astride the cushion and
 had my first riding depths playing angels and molding little lesson bessie didn t respond quickly to the cakes which
 we set out in rows on the old pull of the reins for she liked to have somework bench one
 day after a morning s one to follow thus for a while my rides fun and following our usual afternoon
 nap were taken with a member of the family we went out to play again how amazed walking ahead and
 even roy the pup on we were to feel a breath of warm air against occasion served as a guide
 it was a big our cheeks and how dismayed to discover day when the real saddle arrived that that our
 upstanding little cakes now looked meant further lessons both for me and bessad and flat we rushed into the house
 with sie they were short lived however for i became very chafed where a saddle strap rubbed against my thigh
 and gave me a raw sore poor bessie suffered too she had a sore where the pommel part of the
 saddle rubbed against her spine so i was grounded till our sores healed and then a better saddle pad prevented
 further grief from then on we had many delightful outings sometimes i rode beside dada whose mount was a big
 horse named sunny i was shown how to sit upright in the saddle how to poise my toes in the
 stirrups and how to hold the reins low over the horse s neck it was great fun riding with my
 dada but it came to an end when sunny met with disaster caused by a spear grass working into his
 throat he was shot and i can t remember that he was replaced dada also bought some ducks and we
 c jled them pets too they were sheltered mrs william addle the author s mother in some up ended packing
 cases enclosed had a lonely life when she first came to by a wire mesh fence in the area of
 that canada little yard they swam and splashed in water held in the ground by shallow tubs we little man
 with the caption force made didn t have our ducks very long though him sunny jim many a night we
 wakened to the howling our vitamins came largely from canned of wolves and though dada had his gun tomatoes canning
 in those days wasn t too at the ready the thieves at last sneaked in carefully inspected for on several
 occasions and made off with what eventually might we found a foreign body in the can s have been some
 good dinners for ourselves juicy depths once there was a stone that we kept no more ducks created quite a
 splash when the tin was fresh meat for the dinner table came tipped back and forth another time i found
 from the cook house supply shop at the a man s signet ring and on reporting this camp i was
 often delegated to do this er find i was told to go back and look for the rand and became
 quite an efficient shop finger per the butcher would hold a cut for my a story was told in our
 little community inspection and quite readily put it down about an itinerant laborer who used to carry again when i
 said that i thought that wasn t innumerable cans of tomatoes in his wagon quite what mama wanted fish was
 brought for this reason he was dubbed tomato to the door by a poor simpleton who was dick he declared
 that his good health a marvellous fisherman he would arrive came from a generous use of this fruit with his
 catch of river trout literally fes dried fruit was also available we had tooned about his body mama was always
 known prunes in england of course and delighted to buy from him for we all en learned to like them
 but dried apple rings joyed this form of crisp protein were a new experience they came in large every day
 it was my chore to walk up flat boxes which were displayed on the to clark s farm to get
 a supply of fresh store counter and we bought them by the milk this farm nestled among the hills pound
 they were brownish in colour beless than a mile to the south i was very cause they were never very

 reminded us of when the evening came and mama and the home of one of our english aunts it dada
 had not returned the hours seemed was full of knick knacks antimacassars very long and the darkness very black we
 spread on chair backs little tables here and were lonely and anxious so we decided to there and a big
 table on which was laid a say our prayers asking god to help bring repast of scones tarts and generous

 that day the butter was sour ing a fence for drifting snow had nearly the dear ladies couldn t understand

 south east of the ball in cowley to which mama and dada mine also invited us to visit with them
 had been invited and mama was busy for after the long slow ride we stepped out several days sewing a
 dress for herself of the buckboard with creases in our clothes on another occasion some english ladies and stiffness in
 our limbs all about was invited us to tea at their home near burmis drab the yard was a churned

 possibility of open low and rambling logs i think inside ing a mine there so the territory was famil mrs
 mowatt welcomed us with grace and jar to him but the journey was a real ad friendliness she showed us
 into our bedventure to us and we wore our best dresses room where there was only one bed but on
 that occasion they were made of cream a big one we were assured that cots would japanese silk soft and
 lovely to the touch be put up for the little girls for the week mama made all our clothes and
 she lavish end visit however mama insisted that we ‘ ‘ and i was to look after her the school
 that was situated reasonably near was a convent in lethbridge and we were duly instructed what to expect and how
 to conduct ourselves there mama said on certain days you will have to make a list bundle your laundry and
 put a label on it you will sleep in a big bedroom called a dormitory and you 0 1 will
 have to make your own beds and keep things tidy she instructed us as she sat at her whirring sewing
 machine i think vera and i were somewhat awed at the prospect of going away to school but of course
 we kept our misgivings to ourselves we needn t have worried though for at the last moment we were told
 that we were not to go after all mama had decided that she couldn t part with her two little
 girls besides i suspect that she might have worried a little that her two little girls might become two little
 roman catholics ianyway life resumed its former pace and we continued to absorb fairy stories grimm and anderson over which
 our laughter sometimes dissolved in tears or vice versa we recited nursery rhymes by william addle the author s father
 was the score and memorized verses from our manager of the coal mine at lundbreck books of which we had
 a generous supply could manage nicely three in a row and i could read tolerably well having picked one across
 the foot and we did some it up by the look and say method used on how on saturday we
 were taken round the well known tales i had little idea of addiranch there was talk of acreages and tion
 subtraction multiplication or division heads but my only vivid memory is of beyond learning the tables and even the big
 black bull that stood surveying us less of fractions with the possible excepapparently quite oblivious of the shiny brass tion
 of one half i think we both had a ring in its nose realistic conception of this because we looking
 back i wonder what two little were never given a whole banana or a whole girls found to do over
 the long hours of a orange mama sought to instil unselfishness weekend i do remember that we had fun by
 having us share and it was not until looking at pictures through a stereoscope we went away from home that
 we knew the first we had ever seen and we what it was like not to have to cut fruit
 were quite intrigued when mrs mowatt into two equal parts or share evenly the produced little molded colored jellies for

 she was fam were the little talks we had with mama as ous and the following day we drove home
 we sat around the kitchen table eating nuts under a still grey sky after a long walk it was here
 that we learn by the time i was eight years old my ed to discuss and express ourselves though only
 schooling had been brief sessions in we had never attended sunday school we private kindergartens before we came to had
 bible story books and had always ac canada so naturally dada and mama were companied mama to church before we
 left concerned about my lack of formal educa england so we talked about god and wontion they began to think
 about sending me dered if he really was all powerful for to a boarding school since there was no example
 could he put the nuts together school within reach for day pupils vera again i think mama must have found
 some was to attend also to be company for me of our imaginings very difficult to straighten out in this
 instance we were quite satis then there were the occasions when our fied to know that god could put the
 nuts parents entertained guests we were remindtogether again but for reasons of his own ed to speak when spoken to
 and otherwise he didn t necessarily do things that he to be seen and not heard peter lund and could
 do again and again we returned to john breckenridge the promoters of the the idea of eternal life in heaven
 in order mine whose names were blended to form to help ourselves with the concept of for lundbreck were often
 our guests they ever we used to recite the word itself came at intervals to inspect progress and ad infinitum
 as if the repetition would some consult with dada on the whole operation how enlighten i must admit however that
 the advent of any guest called for the we never reached the stage of thinking that snowiest of linen and
 the best china and eternal life on streets of gold with milk and silver mama had brought these lovely honey

 bill smith one of the free and independent ranchers of the elbow came into town yesterday to have a little
 diversion he had it bill is somewhat notorious as a master of the manly art and many stories of his
 prowess are told when bill gets on a tear it takes about seven policemen to tame him so he calculated
 that as the town only had three guardians and the mounted police were away he could run any kind of
 a show he liked he started in early and was soon stretched on the sidewalk basking in the sun policeman
 barker came along and smith used some very sneering and insulting language to him barker called the chief they tried
 to reason with smith but he was too far gone for that so they cuffed him and dragged him to
 the lockup smith however did not intend to stay there if he could avoid it shortly after 6 he asked
 constable barton for a drink and as soon as the door opened on him he said good evening to barton
 and walked off up town he borrowed a horse belonging to jas votier and started for home across the mission
 barton did not like the way smith had treated him so he got a horse and followed him chief ingram
 and constable barker did the same they overhauled smith about half way across the mission and made him dismount the
 police then proceeded to shackle him but he resisted and knocked the officers down as fast as they came near
 him finally the chief grew weary of being laid out so he drew his revolver and warned smith that the
 show must close the latter then submitted but he refused to walk to the station and the police had to
 get a carriage for him when he went peacefully he was arraigned before his worship this morning and fined the
 enormous sum of 3 and costs smith is an ex policeman calgary weekly herald sept 9 1887 membership membership in
