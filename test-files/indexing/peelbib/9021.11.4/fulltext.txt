 charles e m c laughlin on may 12 1912 at wolf creek the catenhead party untied their two fifty foot
 scows and started down the mcleod river their ultimate destination was halfway river flats on the peace river in british
 columbia they had come from edmonton on the grand trunk pacific railway the object of their projected trip was supposed
 to be primarily to take up land in what was reported to be potentially rich farming country but actually the
 urge to explore to trade with the indians to pioneer in many ways was what excited the imagination of the
 leader and organizer douglas catenhead age about twenty five and it was his enthusiasm that sparked the whole enterprise as
 a preliminary to the main under passage to grouard and of course me taking doug catenhead and his brother aged
 twenty one and itching for adven hasard both expert outdoorsmen had ture i had known doug catenhead in scouted the
 route the previous year edmonton for some time and when i travelling in a small boat satisfied heard of the
 adventure that was afoot that the scows could make the trip the i intimated my willingness to be counted boys
 built a cache and then doug re in so i was added as helper my job turned to his people
 now camped at was not humdrum alone in my small wolf creek while hasard stayed at canoe i was to
 travel ahead of the scows halfway river flats to hold the land in order to dope the water for doug
 they had chosen who steered the family boat at wolf creek preparations went each scow carried a load of about
 along carefully but fast spruce lum five tons and was equipped with two ber for the scows and a year
 s provisions rowing sweeps and one in the stern for of food had been ordered from edmonton steering a man
 with a pike pole in the and soon the catenheads had contructed bow of the leading scow helped to two
 fifty foot scows strong capacious manoeuver the heavy craft but sharp nosed somewhat like york leaving smith s landing near
 peers boats as used by the hudson s bay com a settlement of a few homesteaders we pany for tracking
 up more or less un were soon floating peacefully north known rivers through an unspoiled wilderness of hills so finally
 on that beautiful spring wooded with poplar spruce and lodgeday the party excited and happy were pole pines but not
 for long a few off for the virtually unknown the group miles down stream doug s scow got stuck on
 a bar and it needed all our consisted of the organizer and leader douglas catenhead his mother his sis manpower
 to get it off near evening ter carrie aged sixteen his mother s luck was wifh us in getting by
 a large sister mrs brisco from ontario and her jam pile of big uprooted trees lodged on rocks son isaac
 about twenty five years old and grandma over seventy weighing the women of course did the cookmore than two hundred
 pounds this ing on a mcclary camp range set up dear lady had to be carried sometimes on the family
 scow they prepared magniand assisted at all times for though ficent meals to satisfy our tremendous her spirit was strong
 her muscles were appetites there was plenty of fuel for weak besides the family there were the stove because we
 had surmised that fred monteith who had a cabin at cache dry wood might not always be avail creek on
 the peace river and two other able and so had carried enough to do men called dick and bill working
 their for several days mr mi laughlin came to alberta from iowa wit i his parents in 1903 and was
 raised on a far ii west of edmonton he worked in the automotive field for the past fort years and
 now is semi retired 1 at the end of that first day the scows trouble geese deer and a black
 bear were tied up for the night in a quiet were not alarmed by our passing b oats stretch of
 water the women slept in a tent on the family scow and the men the thrill of the day came
 in running on the other or on shore this was a a rapid in a canyon this called for real
 game country abounding in deer a sharp ninety degree turn executed black bear moose beaver and birds quickly in order
 to miss running into a including wild geese it also afforded cliff doug did a good job with the good
 fishing of northern pike and trout family boat but fred nearly came to a big help in feeding a hungry
 crew grief i had a rough patsage in my canoe but got through with only a soak on the following
 day may 13 th we ing we were all very glad to tie up were off to an early start
 we encoun to some trees in a good spot for the tered faster water and incurred more night damage by
 running onto gravel bars the rough going caused the boats to on the fourth day of travel all went leak
 more than they did normally and well until fred got off course in a rapid by night when we tied
 up by a flat of and wiped off the top of his load as he tall pines we had covered
 only about went under a big sweeper the boys thirty miles and we knew that the boats ducked in time
 but a coop containing had to be overhauled and reinforced twelve hens and two roosters a table a before we
 went any further mattress and springs a bed roll and a few other articles went overboard the next day we
 spent unloading and coop luckily opened and the poultry then packing the outfit up a ten foot with loud squawks
 fluttered to shore bank to set up camp while the over doug and dick in a big canoe which hauling
 was being done we had to was carried as part of the equipment handle great bundles of farm machinery recovered
 all the chickens the table a year s supply of food canned gopds springs mattress and bed roll from a
 flour etc etc and a fifty gallon barrel sand bar downstream dick lost his of coal oil about ten tons
 in all pistol pipe and watch but on the whole no serious damage was done to strengthen the scows doug
 selec the bedding dried in a few days and ted two long lodge pole pines placing the cocks crowed loud
 and early next them on seven foot high saw horses to whip saw them into four timbers each morning as
 usual over fifty feet in length these three the going was good from here on inch by six inch planks
 solidly bolted and evening saw the boats tied up in onto the outside of the boats from stem front of
 the store at whitecourt the to stern gave the needed strength and natives and men from a railway conbackbone to
 the scows in river use struction camp nearby all turned out to welcome us and look over our outfit while
 we were repairing the boats a survey party also in two scows and the next day may 23 rd saw
 us off a large raft with three men and a team early in a few minutes we entered the of
 horses aboard went smoothly by the mighty athab asca wide and swift beparties hailed each other only the tween high
 banks covered with timber horses looking contented and thoughtful full of islands it offered a choice of paid no attention
 several channels in less than a mile doug was hard on a gravel bar fred after a week s delay
 we loaded once following shot by barely escaping colmore and got off to a good start the lision all efforts
 to move doug s scow river being up a foot we now passed failed luckily a survey party was through
 timbered flats into more open camped nearby and doug got four sand hill country of bright green poplars husky men
 to help our united efforts and scattered pines on high rocky cliffs succeeded in shoving the boat into the river
 was swift and narrow in deeper water places care was needed to avoid the odd sweeper a tree leaning out
 over on our way again we passed through the water close to the surface helped the kind of country pioneers
 dream of by the rise in water we had no serious soon to be invaded by lumbermen these 2 the
 scows and canoe of the catenhead party are seen pulled up to the bank of mcleod river for the night
 note the women s tent at centre glorious forests would resound to the bar doug and i took off in
 the big canoe crash of falling timbers and the screech and soon collected him for our larder of sawmills the
 few trappers moving we stopped a day at the mouth of north to new territory already survey the pembjna and
 smoked the meat to parties were busy cutting lines and map prevent it spoiling off we went again ping the
 land making ready for the in the first rainstorm so far two days settlers seeking to file on homesteads later
 after a night of rain and one excit we passed a few especially beautiful ing rapid we bade the athabasca
 goodspots flats of virgin soil with timber bye and tied up in the mouth of the for buildings and game
 for food until lesser slave river at mirror landing the homesteader could raise his own here the floating cruise was
 at an end this year the canadian northern rail the lesser slave river formed part way was laying steel from
 edmonton of a water route for steam boats from to athabasca and building a line to athabasca landing to grouard
 on the whitecourt to give access to this region west end of lesser slave lake the les after we had
 run through a few rough ser slave river is a small stream like spots with some huge jam piles of
 big the mcleod the first sixteen miles swift trees lodged on bars the river became in places with small rapids
 but from tamer flowing more in one channel on soto landing to lesser slave lake slug may 24 th we
 passed the mouth of the gish winding and fairly deep to avoid freeman river near the historical site the first
 sixteen miles of dangerous river of fort assiniboine from this point fur boats from athabasca unloaded their traders in the
 past traveled up the cargoes at mirror landing and had them athabasca to jasper also up the free portaged by
 teams to soto landing to man north into the wild swan hills area be shipped by steam boat to lesser
 slave next day slowly floating over long quiet lake and grouard in earlier days york stretches through country where only
 a boats had been tracked all the way upfew trappers ran their traplines we saw stream to slave lake by
 the same route several bear deer and lots of wild now we tracked our scows upstream geese it was the
 custom in those early a mile and made camp on a nice open days to shoot game when you needed
 flat where we unloaded four tons of supit so spotting a yearling moose on a plies which doug had arranged
 to have 3 portaged to soto landing he also at soto landing the freight that had hired eight natives to
 help us up the been hauled over the portage was rerapids with the empty scows loaded the northern transportation co
 s little side wheeler steamer was now we had to get the scows up the here and doug arranged for
 a tow to sixteen difficult miles of riverto soto grouard for the family boat and left landing we were divided
 into two me with six natives to track the other crews with six trackers and two extra scow to lesser
 slave lake men to each scow at the rapids one scow had to be moved at a time with we
 made an early start this time i twelve men tracking six on each line steered and the natives tracked we
 each man with a breast strap attached rigged a sail and helped by an east separately to a one hundred
 and fifty wind made good time arriving at saw foot towline on june 3 rd we had break ridge later
 named slave lake in two fast and were on our way by six thirty in days here we tied up
 at the ferry the morning had two lunches during the the crew was paid off and we were day and
 dinner at eight the ladies pro rejoined by fred who took over my steerviding all the service no mean job
 i ing job across the lake assure you this was the only time i ever envied a plow horse he
 has at least this spot where we stopped was a a smooth path on which to walk we pretty place
 on the sandy lake shore had to scramble over down fall and there were a few neat buildings a small
 rocks through brush often in cold water store with a good stock of moose hide up to our waists this
 kind of work is moccasins gloves coats and many kinds surely a test of a man s endurance it s
 of trade goods hard on clothes and tempers especially while we were here the nt co s if you fail
 to keep your strap tight at boat arrived and a tow to grouard was one spot the tow lines to
 the family h oat arranged next morning tied to the broke but the native steered it safely steamer by a
 heavy one hundred and stern first until it reached slower water fifty foot rope we were on our way it
 was a thrill for the women but two soon we passed dog island a summer hours extra work for us

 i j t the catenhead party travelled down the mcleod river from the railway and by following a circuitous land
 and water route finally reached its destination at hallway river flats in british columbia by the time they had reached
 british columbia members of the catenhead party were seasoned travellers this view was taken at the camp of fred monteith
 shortly after the travellers had reached their destination looked as if we might have a smooth teamsters had loaded our
 belongings passage but a wind came up and the into ten wagons and were to deliver lake got rough the
 pounding waves them to the boat landing at the town started leaks of course fred was steer of peace river
 we followed later doug ing i bailing and the captain doing all with the family in a wagon with spring
 he could to ease us along but it looked seats accompanied by a load of camp as if our luck
 had run out every few gear and me walking as i preferred my minutes a big wave would dump more
 own legs to the jolting wagon a tent water aboard however about five p m was set up each night
 for the ladies we were able to run around a point into grandma enjoyed the trip thoroughly quieter water and
 safely made the dock but it was quite a stunt to load and unnear grouard we had a thanksgiving load
 her the weather was hot but dinner on the captain that night at least once every day we crossed a
 doug joined us next morning greatly stream big enough for a swim relieved to find us safe we sailed the
 on june 20 th the fourth day in more scow across buffalo bay and up the open prairie country the
 trail improved heart river a mile about six miles in and near evening at last my first neverall to the
 family camp already estab to be forgotten view of the great peace lished by doug the boats were un stream
 where it is joined by the big loaded here doug fred isaac and i smoky we paused for a few
 minutes by sailed them to grouard grouard was a historical site the final resting place then a drab collection of
 unpainted frame of twelve foot davis from this spot buildings including inevitably a real the view was breath taking the
 trail estate office on a treeless stretch of drops hundreds of feet down to the vilsand doug sold the scows
 and we lage of peace river the settlement was paddled back to camp in his big canoe small the main
 buildings being a hud dick and bill left us here son s bay company store a telegraph after a night

 flats lay before us hasard and happy holiday camped by a great jones had a camp established and they river
 we had no sense of hurry no welcomed our arrival four hours of worry and no heavy work while we
 hard work saw us unloaded and packed were here doug added to the outfit two up the bank the cows
 calves and fowl cows with calves bought from a mr el were obviously glad to be on land again liott
 twenty miles south doug and i the land where the catenheads had in a wagon made a two day trip
 to get squatted was a beautiful grass flat these beasts with rich soil and a stand of spruce while we
 were in camp peace river timber at the west end where the half celebrated july 1 st it was a
 big day way joins the peace that was the end with indian pony races canoe races tug of the main
 trek for the catenhead party of war etc and a crowd of at least fifty but not for fred and
 i i made no money on the races and nearly we went on by steamer to hudson lost my pants
 on an unscheduled dog hope fred on business and i to see the fight country the next day the boat
 tied up on july 2 nd with a whistle blast in an eddy at the foot of the peace that
 sent echoes bouncing from hill to river rapids where the peace comes boilhill and started natives running to the ing
 out of the rocky mountains landing the steamboat arrived we hudson hope consisted of two small loaded the outfit the
 cows needing some hudson s bay company buildings closed persuasion to set foot on the gangplank at the time a
 dozen log cabins and tents and were soon away our regular cook occupied by men with visions of a land
 scott being absent we had in his place boom waiting for a survey party on its allie brick a pioneer
 of the peace with way here to run lines and locate corners a great stock of tales of the early
 days fred set up his small tent and stove and his yarns made good listening there we stayed my canoe
 serving as passing a small settlement which in a ferry for us to get back and forth cluded both an
 anglican mission and a across the peace roman catholic one we entered the un three days later isaac brisco arrived
 surveyed wilds again for the next five from halfway with two horses to make a days we enjoyed a pleasure
 cruise the trip over the portage still not tired of kind one dreams of in the midst of adventure i
 accompanied him though nature beautiful and seemingly benign we ran out of food and had to live mostly we passed
 dunvegan a trading post on fish and game we had no spectacular with a few buildings on an open flat
 experiences and returned safe and sound and a ferry and then reached fort st to hudson hope from here isaac
 de john british columbia located a few parted for halfway with the horses and yards from the river fort st
 john was i in my canoe for peace river a month an old hudson s bay company post still later
 i was at home in edmonton doing business in furs some beaver douglas catenhead spent the next indians had a
 camp there thirty years on or by the peace at times every day the steamer had to pull he left
 the settlement to act as pilot on up for several hours while we cut wood the big river steamer d
 a thotnas from for its hungry fire box the captain hudson hope to vermilion later he ran had left a
 man off to cut wood both diesel boats for the hudson s bay cornhe and the wood to be picked
 up on the pany and at times in winter he carried return trip but he had quit in less than
 the mail on the same route by sleigh a month he had been afraid of the whatever he did he
 was never far from bears and there were plenty of them the great peace i greenwich house by james g
 macgregor on october 7 1798 for the north west company david thompson built the first trading post on lac la

 the ensuing winter on september 6 1799 peter fidler spearheading the hudson s bay company s opposition arrived at lac
 la biche and built greenwich house close to thompson s there except for a trip to the mouth of lesser
 slave lake river and a holiday trip to fort edmonton fidler spent the winter along with most students i have

 unlikely passage into the large lake that portion of the lake shore secondly and thus the approximate location of a

 shown above the maze of lakes streams and marshes made the trek an arduous one for the trader and for
 others who later used this same route sir george simpson s route is shown by a series of crosses while
 fidler s is the heavy broken line but five years before david thompson s detailed inspection shaw penetrated arrival at
 lac ia biche had ascended the to moose lake by ascending the beaver peace on a successful trip to the
 pacific river whose flabby waters stretched a ocean it was not until 1792 that the flaccid finger far west between
 the rival companies entered alberta along saskatchewan and athabasca rivers the saskatchewan river that year they it was this intrusive
 finger of the churestablished fort george and bucking chill watershed that complicated matters ham house near modern elk point then
 for both peter fidler and david thompby 1795 they had pushed further up son in passing from the two companies
 the saskatchewan river with the north main establishments fort george and west company locating its first fort buckingham house the
 beaver inter augustus near modern fort saskatche posed a frustrating web of somnolent wan and the hudson s bay company
 streams between the saskatchewan and building its first fort edmonton beside lao la biche whose waters flowed into it the
 athabasca in the vicinity of fort edmonton access from the saskatchewan except for angus shaw s venture on to the
 athabasca was simple and direct moose lake however the athabasca by way of the pembina river but from upstream from
 fort mcmurray and the fort george north the going was much region extending west from the east more arduous and
 frustrating travellers boundary of alberta and lying between had to cross two heights of land one the athabasca and saskatchewan
 rivers from the saskatchewan to the beaver were as yet known to white men largely watershed and the other from
 it over to by indian report only and not by careful the streams draining into the athabasca 8 in david
 thompson s time at fort little wonder that he decided that the george it was customary to use horses to
 route to the coast should thenceforth be carry goods approximately three miles up the saskatchewan river to edmonton north to
 the stream running south out of and then from there across to fort assini moosehills lake section 13 57 6
 from boine on the athabasca river there canoes could be used for about four miles north along the lake and
 up gabriel franchere on his way to the the stream that enters its north end east from astoria on the
 lower columbia there a mile long portage took them river used the beaver river route and over the height of
 land into waters flow on june 5 1814 left lao la biche he ing down to kehiwin lake the going
 does not mention any official fur trade was easy for the six miles along the lake company houses but does
 refer to the but became difficult on the way down two earliest settlers on the lake shore kehiwin creek into
 bangs lake and from desjarlais and nadeau to anyone it to moose lake even the outlet from who has studied
 fidler s route into the this lake the moose lake river winding lake it is obvious that franchere used it
 and encumbered with boulders was a to get across the portage to the beaver trial to canoe men in all
 but the highest river water then ascending the trifling on june 13 1817 ross ccx also east excessively tortuous beaver
 river to its bound from the columbia camped on forks at modern briereville a distance the shore of lac la
 biche and his journal as measured along its deep valley of 40 also does not mention any fur trade posts
 miles but over three times that by the there he too used fidler s and thomptwists and turns of the
 stream was son s route to the beaver river and says equally difficult at its forks the canoe about three
 miles to the eastward of men had to take the lesser branch flow t lies a small lake called our
 encampmen ing in from the north side and with the by the canadians le petit lac de biche utmost effort
 to ascend it to the next mr stewart s men had commenced height of land that from the beaver this
 portage yesterday and it took us watershed to lao la biche the greater part of this day to finish it
 since the beaver river flows out of which will not appear extra ordinary when it is considered that 10 large
 the deep and magnificent beaver lake it has been easy with the help of george canoes and between 200 and
 300 packs simpson s journal of 1824 to assume that of beaver each weighing upwards of the canoemen continued upstream
 into 90 lbs had to be carried three miles the lake and then struck off overland through a swampy marsh
 full of underwood during the greater part of which to cross the two miles to lao la biche george simpson
 however does explain it rained heavily encamped at 4 00 the inadequacy of the beaver river in p m on
 the shore of the little lake and september by saying many parts of it which we had previously crossed and
 not even having an appearance of mois which was not more than half a mile in breadth ture we had
 now got to where an indian winter track strikes off to the on june 14 they portaged 250 paces northward
 and falls into lac ia biche to little beaver river on the way after passing the several lakes and port
 down it they had to construct dams at ages and i now am determined on fol intervals of 400 or
 500 paces the men lowing it by way of this trail it being sent ahead to make more dams took
 his party three days to carry canoes and goods over the first seven mile port david thompson the first white
 man age and to cross a lake or two one to pass over this portage left a record more day
 of paddling over several lakes of it which elliot coues has summarized and packing over several portages took by reporting
 that thompson travelling them through beaver lake and over to up the beaver reached the forks briere lac la biche
 simpson s description of ville on october 1 1798 he went up the route taken is hard to follow but
 he the little beaver river which he says is probably went by way of frenchman on an average 8 yards
 wide and 8 ironwood and elinor lakes after his inches deep on october 3 he reached experience with the beaver
 river it is a portage of 370 yards which took him portage from beaver river to lag la bighe scale
 details of the portages on the difficult trek to lac ia biche are shown on this map it also includes
 details from a map prepared by fidler at the time of his trip in 1799 on the basis of research
 the author feels greenwich house was located on river lot 59 or 60 northwest of the present town the route
 taken by sir george simpson in 1824 is shown at the upper right 10 into a little lake field lake
 and wholly 2 miles along the track upwards of four away jro i beaver river the next day he miles
 1 passed through this lake for about three i have transferred the information miles in a northwest direction to the
 shown on the sktech in his journal to head of the red deer brook since the attached map showing modern
 land it was so full of rushes that he found it subdivisions and have indicated his impossible to float his
 canoes any fur route and the two beaver dams he menther he left them for his men to carry tions
 it will be seen that he made his 3 4 of a mile to a beaver dam his course way
 through the reedy marsh and along was n 22 e and finally he was able the small creek which empties
 into lac to launch his canoes on a small brook la biche just at the edge of the higher with
 plenty of water and soon reached ground at the western margin of the lac la biche with a heartfelt thank
 modern town from there he paddled god west half a mile and then north ¾ of a mile to greenwich
 house which was about a year later peter fidler probably in river lot 59 or 60 his whose journal of
 1799 i have had the reference to arriving at the house and opportunity to study reached lac la finding his
 men well there leaves us to biche by the same route as thompson presume that not long previously these his
 comments on it are as follows men had been sent over from bucking this is the height of land here
 ham house with the intention of building went along the small swampy lake greenwich house presumably too as under low
 swampy land all around they would build it within a gunshot of this lake and about 300 yards wide and
 david thompson s house pretty deep a deep dirty grassy swamp these two houses of 1798 and 1799 at the
 west end from the lake to what then must have been built on or close is called the beaver dam

 on the shores of egg lakes later therien lakes some one hundred and twenty eight miles north east of edmonton
 their immediate goal was to save the disorganized metis people from the corrupting elements of the white pioneers who were
 unashamedly abusing them father lacombe deemed it possible even desirable to perpetuate this race while his companion realizing the impracticableness
 of such an endeavor prefered to set his sights much higher his plan kept to himself till 1905 consisted in
 nothing less than a total integration with the french canadian element of the population since the great majority of the
 metis were of that stock four precedents influenced the mis bility of a reaction founded the colony sionaries thinking the
 jesuit colonies of saint paul des metis to stem the tide founded in new france and paraguay as early as

 title of the land for a renewable period of twenty one years the history of the enterprise may be apportioned
 into three epochs the initial one july 15 1896 to june 1901 is the heroic period a residence containing a
 chapel a school and living a cairn erected by the province of alberta quarters were erected a model farm just
 east of the present town of st paul cornwhich was meant to inspire the metis memorates the missionary venture and

 main ones were hence from 1905 to 1909 during the the ab sence of sufficient funds and the absence of

 disillusionment what wise counsellor 14 twice disappointed by milton williams in the spring of 1885 occurred what has now passed
 into history as the north west rebellion in order to suppress a rising of the cree indians under big bear
 which took place shortly after the opening of hostilities by the halfbreeds a body of troops marched from calgary northward
 to the saskatchewan the column consisted on leaving calgary of a mounted force of police and scouts under major s
 b steele part of the winnipeg light infantry under colonel osborne smith some companies of the 65 th batallion of
 mount royal rifles under colonel hughes and were joined later on by some scouts from the edmonton home guard and
 a detachment of the mounted rifles under major hatton the whole column was commanded by major general t b strange
 the train of wagons accompanying the troops was very large owing to the long distances between places where supplies could
 reach us and the number of teams must have been about 250 in order to understand the mistake usual a
 good place for the indians to which caused our first disappointment attack us we thought the nature of the formation
 of the column must be the country made it impossible for the flankers to ride at any distance from the
 known first was the advance guard trail so we were all together and the of scouts and mounted police which
 column unguarded at either side we kept about a quarter of a mile ahead came to a small stream harmless
 to look of the rest of the column then some wag at but awful to get across ons containing stores
 and foot soldiers the first part of the column had got flanked by mounted men who rode about through fairly
 well but as each team a quarter of a mile distant from the crossed the place became more diffitrain next
 the ammunition wagons heav cult for the next one as the soft bottom ily guarded by infantry and mounted was
 cut up by the wheels sinking deeply men after them came the remainder in the clay and the banks had
 become of the wagons with stores and flanked slippery with mud and water dropping as the other parts of the
 column while from the horses and wagons finally a strong body of scouts and police rode it became almost impossible
 for a team some distance behind all and were to get through unaided and they had called the rear guard
 to double up that is put an extra team the country about edmonton was on the wagon tongue and for
 a while well wooded with large willows along it worked very well but caused a great the north side of
 the saskatchewan we delay then someone suggested that found it hard to keep always in the a long rope attached
 to the tongue of a usual order as those riding at a short wagon and manned by fifteen or twenty
 distance off the main trail could not see men would do the work more expedithe rest of the column unless
 they came tiously and leave the team free to go as in and marched along the road soon as it
 was pulled out this fifteen donkey power worked famously and we the trails as a rule were bad there found
 we were in for a big job as there being so many sloughs and creeks to were a great many
 teams yet to cross cross and as it was spring the creeks a sergeant and some of the scouts pulled
 were usually running full we were out quite a number of wagons that way travelling one afternoon through a piece
 although we thought it would have been of country more densely wooded than more reasonable for the infantry who 71

 rebellion ansi prepared th is mann s ript sortie rears later 15 rode in the wagons to pull out their
 own trail made it impossible to see tar in conveyances when all that part of the either direction behind him
 were the column of which we were the guardians troopers riding two and two their had gone on ahead the
 sergeant told horses and themselves splashed with us we had better mount and ride along mud from galloping through mud
 holes after them and creeks we had just time to get a look at them as they passed the an
 officer of the 65 th was standing officer in command had his face set sternby the crossing of the creek
 giving ly as he rode ahead lcoking back at orders that no one obeyed and laboring times as the men
 were unable to keep under the delusion that he was directing pace with him calling out close up operations the
 front part of the column close up and slightly checking his was all this time moving on and as the
 horse until they were all together again rear was stopped by the delay at the we had but a moment
 to notice the varycreek the train was strung out for more ing expressions on the faces of the men than
 two miles and in a somewhat dis here was one trying to look like an old organized state when this
 officer of soldier with his head erect and his the 65 th saw us about to move on he mouth
 firmly closed another seemingly sharply ordered us to remain and pull anxious to get to the front as he leaned
 out the rest of the wagons it was im forward in the saddle and peered around posing a little on
 good nature at least each turn in the road his companion our sergeant thought so for in language maybe anxious
 from another cause and more forcible than polite he consigned trying to conceal his anxiety about his him to a
 place where they never wear own safety by pretending his horse was fur overcoats and calling on the men to
 not going right pulling him this way fall in he marched us along the trail to make him go straight
 and pulling him towards our wagons that way to have an excuse for pulling at him again another would laugh
 and just as we were leaving we heard chirp to his horse and shake his carbine some one shout out
 the order send until the cartridges rattled in the chamback for the rear guard then all was ber as much
 as to say just wait till excitement there must be trouble we get at them but we had not much
 ahead wonder why they want us time for observation before they had bad place to fight injuns these and gone
 leaving us splashed with mud and a dozen other expressions and specula anxious to be with them expecting to tions
 were heard on every side every receive orders every minute to go to the man who was loitering along the
 trail front we waited impatiently but no talking to the teamsters mounted and orders came then we listened for the
 hustled to his place as quickly as his reports of the carbines expecting that excitement and his horse would let
 him they would soon be engaged but no the drivers of the teams and the infantry noise greeted our ears
 finally we beassisting them at the creek redoubled gan to think that possibly there were their efforts to get the
 wagons across no indians there to fight with soon and up with the main body of the we heard horsemen
 coming back from column in a few minutes we heard the the front splash splash through the rear guard coming
 to the front we kept water laughing and joking with the ahead of them for a time but as we
 had teamsters but not in any hurry apparnot been sent for dare not go in advance ently then the valiant
 rear guard reof our proper position so we turned off appeared the horses looking tired the in a little open
 space to let them pass men looking cheap as they jogged back soon we heard more plainly their hoofs to
 the tail end of the column then we thundering up the trail and the warning knew there was no fun
 for us that day shout of clear the road while the for up till the time of actual engagement teamsters
 crowded their wagons off the we always spoke of a brush with thc road into the brush to give them
 free indians as fun passage another moment and the officer in command appeared round a bend the mistake occurred in
 this wayin the road close to us as the thickness the infantry although they rode in wagof the brush and
 the windings of the gons were divided into advance guard 16 this drawing shows the interior of fort edmonton during

 right are the a warehouse commanding officer s quarters and outside the walls hardisty house the residence of the chief
 factor centre and rear guard b ut few outside of it we were expecting now to meet themselves knew it
 when the men who indians every day we had met settlers had been pulling teams out of the creek and
 traders hustling towards edmonton grew tired and wanted to go on to their with their goods hastily thrown into wagons
 and the scouts had so politely carts and wagons and rumors reached refused to do any more the officer of
 us of a contemplated attack by the inthe 65 th shouted across the creek to dians on a reserve near
 victoria we some person to send for the rear guard had marched all forenoon with extra meaning his own men
 thinking that he precautions being taken for our safety had received word from the front and halting now and then
 to reconnoitre and not knowing of any other rear guard allow the column to keep close together than the mounted
 men he sent or carried word back to the scouts and police in the day was hot no breeze at
 all the rear who supposing the word to the country high and dry which was have come from major steele
 thought of unusual as we were now close to the nothing but the getting there as fast as banks of
 the saskatchewan which is possible and almost rode over the 65 th many feet below the prairie level we officer
 as he made an ineffectual effort began to wish it was dinner time as we to stop them were thirsty
 and hot and our horses in the same condition we were at this our next disappointment occurred in time in
 advance of the column and not a somewhat different way although on the flank and got the very welcome caused
 by our own men word that at the first place where good feed could be had for the horses we
 we were nearing victoria a small were to halt we shortly found a suitsettlement and police station on the able
 spot and waited for major steele saskatchewan about 75 miles north east to come up to order the halt as
 the of edmonton and the advance guard choice of camp grounds was often left to had received orders to go
 on ahead to him he was satisfied with the place the fort but none of the other men knew and
 turned off the trail to find a place 17 to form up the men preparatory to dis that the horses
 had been unhitched and mounting when we heard a horse com tied to the carts which was a little suring
 through the brush on our right and saw he was headed straight for the prising as the owners must have
 left in a frame of mind that would leave column the rider was bare headed his scanty crop of hair
 standing on end little thought for the horses and carts and his eyes wide open with fright and and it
 was a queer thing for indians excitement he was bootless as well to do however we had not time to
 as hatless there was no saddle on the speculate we soon found their tracks horse and it was evident he
 had been leading off towards the north and we mounted in a desperate hurry from the followed them we were
 now in the fragments of cart harness that were on brush and expecting to come up with him the rider
 carried a double barrel those we were chasing every moment led shotgun with the stock of which as the tracks
 were as fresh as our own he urged the horse on all the time dig almost but we heard no
 shots nor ging his heels into the horses ribs at saw anything to shoot at and after a the rate
 of 200 strokes to the minute he while began to get a little tired of chasrode up to the major
 and hurriedly and ing tracks and soon we noticed that excitedly told of being chased by in we were near
 the main trail again only dians only a few minutes before he nearer victoria than when we started pointed out
 the direction in which they the tracks we were following turned had gone and evidently expected the down the trail
 instead of crossing it towhole column to start after them on the wards the reserve as we expected they double
 quick would we saw then that there were only a few of them and on looking more major steele listened
 quietly and closely we found that some of the horses put in a question now and then so as to
 were shod we gradually figured it out get some information clear enough to that it could not be indians for
 many judge as to what should be done of reasons and after wondering who it course we were all eager
 to get after the could be we finally remembered that indians and were about as much excited we had seen
 nothing of the advance as the old chap who had been chased guard and after fitting the facts into by
 them we forgot that we were tired each other we came to the conclusion and that our horses were already
 weary that we were on track of our friends inafter their long march only let us get stead of our
 enemies we felt hot and after them a force was made up of miserably tricked and mad our horses the
 mounted men who were at hand sharing the same feelings they had placed under the command of captain altogether the
 worst of it galloping oswald and under the direction of a around over an hour in the boiling sun half
 breed guide started to follow the after a half day s march was no joke track of the enemy we
 soon sighted we turned up the trail towards the some horses and carts at the end of a camp knowing
 we would b e made fun long flçtt 0:flctt and were now fairly on their of by the rest of the
 boys we went trail we thought although we saw no slowly our horses were in a lather and men yet
 then the boys began to pre were blowing like porpoises as we pare for action some leaned sidewise crawled along
 trying hard to appreciate in their saddles while they tightened the joke we heard sundry uncomplimentthem up so as to
 have a firm seat others ary remarks about the excited old gentlerecoiled their picket ropes which had man who had
 mistaken our advance been loosened when we first stopped guard for indians and sent us chasing some pulled ammunition out
 of their our own men it is to be hoped that he cartridge belts and filled the magazines will not
 experience all the bad luck of their carbines others loaded every wished for him for nearly every man in chamber
 of their revolvers and looked the troop called him a baldheaded old anxious to use them we went at a
 idiot or something worse and pronounrattling pace down the flat but the ced a benediction on him to which the
 horses and carts still remained in sight other boys responded amen with a readievidently the drivers had gone in a

 had in mcgill university press montreal 1962 trying to tell where mackenzie went 357 pages 750 as portrayed here the
 author s reviewed by james g macgregor edmonton knowledge of the fur trade is not intensive and may have been
 conned for the in fit st man west professor sheppe and the mcgill press have done us a occasion his
 affair with mackenzie exhibits more of the shotgun of expediservice by reprinting alexander mackenzie s account of his expedition across
 ency than the lingering dalliance of america to the pacific in 1793 and thus lovers and yet mackenzie s narrative
 is all there together with details of his making this interesting document avail route clear and sufficient enough to enable
 once more beyond that little has been added to our knowledge of mac ble one to enjoy and participate in
 mackenzie s great adventure kenzie except perhaps some finer delineation of his route across western british columbia stefansson ambassador of

 of one of the posts there with ing the author and though not involved out realizing what it was in
 any way heard a good deal about the quarrel from them who was right and continuing by paved highway he
 who was wrong will never be decided drove up to dunvegan without any corn now in fact both stefansson leader
 of ment to indicate that mackenzie s camp the northern party and anderson of may 11 was hereabouts and by
 paved leader of the southern party were right highway went on to fort st john and each from his own
 point of view it hudson hope he next intersected mac seems a pity that old wounds should be kenzie s
 route when driving along the re opened now that both of the leading hart highway he crossed the parsnip disputants
 have left this earth river thence he followed it to prince george and on to quesnel then once in tracing
 stefansson s career as he mackenzie started overland for the does lebourdais reminds us once again ocean taking a route
 that is difficult of stef s remarkable accomplishments to trace professor sheppe followed him as an explorer his was the
 last of the as best he could and by doing so and old time dogs and mush expeditions presenting us
 with details of mackenzie s all the more successful because of his route as set out in appendix ii he

 settlement in the northwest the biography of grant himself is jean baptiste lagimodiere is ignored the result of research carried
 on by entirely yet it was he who was to a great extent responsible for the catholic margaret arnett macleod

 of his friends and relatives pro that it did he supported settlement in the west from the start and along
 with fessor morton is responsible for the re his family relatives and friends had search into the seven oaks massacre
 started the lower french speaking settleand the events leading up to that event and its aftermath ments at a time
 when grant was still engaged in the fur trade wars and the authors paint a vivid picture of the lower

 far the largest number of and the color of life in the northwest sedentary metis in the red river cornduring
 the first half of the nineteenth munity in 1838 there were 1 597 souls century in addition they stress the
 all in the lower settlements as opposed to to often ignored fact that the red river 914 in grantown and
 this was before settlement was as much the result of grant lost so much of his influence over french as
 an english effort altogether the free trade dispute which culminated the work is an objective view of the in the
 sayer trial and described by mrs events recorded and a refreshing do macleod and professor morton parture from the current
 trend of emphasizing only the conflict between the from the point of the sayer trial on french and english speaking
 elements the authors outline effectively the rift in the c olony in addition it shows the that developed between the
 decreasing metis people as they were a very diver grant faction and the descendants of sified people and not only
 the unsettled lagimodiere including of course the primitives they are so often pictured riels this background is almost entirely ignored
 by historians covering the my greatest criticism centres around events of 1869 70 and mrs macleod and the statement that
 grant was the professor morton are to be congratulated leader in some senses the maker of the in throwing some
 light on the division metis nation the facts outlined in that influenced later events probably the book show to what
