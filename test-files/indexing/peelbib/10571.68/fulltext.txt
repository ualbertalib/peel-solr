 1 the patrician 2005 colonel in chief message from the colonel in chief ttie countess mountbatten of burma cbe cd 
 jp dl lam always so pleased to provide opening comments for the patrician this journal is an important means for 
 maintaining contact between all patricias regardless of their location it is particularly important to me this year as i was 
 unfortunately unable to visit any of the battalions or association branches this past year while i know that all my 
 patricias fully understand that the reason was because of my husband s bad health it is comforting to know that 
 i have had the strong support of all my patricias this past year has certainly been one of emotional extremes 
 the year has been full of last post announcements as many members of the regimental family have passed on including 
 the gallant soldier colonel jim stone and my dear husband lord john who was so very proud to be an 
 honorary patricia while saddened by their passing we can cherish their memories and the contributions that each of them made 
 to the regiment and to their country the year 2005 was also a busy year of preparation soldiers across the 
 regiment were engaged in the important task of preparing for operations or of supporting those who were preparing for deployment 
 i was extremely impressed to learn how well these preparations were conducted and it made me confident that the soldiers 
 heading off on operations to afghanistan and elsewhere were fully prepared for their missions it is comforting to know that 
 the inherent risks of missions of this nature are mitigated by the professional approach to pre mission training and preparation 
 with patricia soldiers deployed across the world on missions that are increasingly more dangerous and challenging i am heartened to 
 know that the patricia family is such a supportive and close knit group we will look after each other and 
 support one another in these stressful times i am so very proud to be your colonel in chief and to 
 be associated with such a fine organization 
 the patrician 2005 2 colonel of the regiment message from the colonel of the regiment mgen robert i stewart cmm 
 cd ret d fellow patricias 2005 has been a year in which missions to afghanistan have been the major focus 
 of the regiment s activities during the year we have had soldiers deployed in afghanistan while others have conducted major 
 training events in preparation for dispatch there in 2006 patricia platoons were deployed to kabul and later in the year 
 individuals from 3 ppcli formed the major component of the provincial reconstruction team in kandahar i had the privilege of 
 visiting the prt during the christmas period and found the soldiers to be in good spirits committed to their mission 
 and fully capable of meeting the challenge in the fall i visited wainwright to observe the first battalion task force 
 which included a company from the second battalion undertake their final pre deployment training prior to departure for afghanistan i 
 was satisfied that their training had prepared them for this dangerous and challenging mission and confident that the battle group 
 will do a splendid job later in january 2006 i was on hand to see the first of the deployments 
 depart from edmonton sadly we have suffered a number of members killed or seriously wounded from both the prt and 
 the first battalion battle group the members of the extended regimental family were deeply saddened by this but heartened by 
 the fact that despite these losses the soldiers continue to uphold the regiment s reputation for courage and professionalism as 
 your colonel of the regiment i was fortunate this year to visit all three battalions in the field and garrison 
 i shared time with the 2nd battalion during kapyong day celebrations presented medals to returning members of 3 ppcli visited 
 with them in victoria during training and again for menton days in fort lewis once again i visited our new 
 patricias as they underwent training at lfwa training centre many of these new patricias upon graduation were immediately deployed to 
 afghanistan i was confident that the training they received prepared them to be integrated quickly and easily into their battalions 
 the year has been a productive one for the regimental association the volunteer patricia program a program devoted to providing 
 assistance and support to members of the regimental family was firmly established and in operation in addition the association in 
 2004 sent christmas comforts to the members of 1 and 3 ppcli deployed in kabul and in march of 2006 
 provided through operation small pack a variety of regimental pattern and other civilian clothing items for casualties evacuated from afghanistan 
 through germany on route home these efforts by the association in support of the deployed patricias reflect their continued concern 
 and involvement in the welfare of our serving members as colonel of the regiment i am very proud of the 
 performance of the regiment in 2005 well done and all the best for continued success and good soldiering 
 3 the patrician 2005 rho editor s comments message from the regimental major major e a giraldeau cd annual production 
 of the patrician allows me to reflect on the past year s activities and achievements of the regiment i continue 
 to be amazed and impressed by the level of professionalism demonstrated by all ranks of the regiment given the current 
 op and training tempo the dedication and devotion to duty is inspiring i wear my capbadge with great pride and 
 am proud to be associated with the men and women of this fine regiment a commanding officer recently said that 
 we are a regiment at war strong words indeed but ones that are acutely true in today s turbulent world 
 environment the fact of the matter is that the regiment is currently fronting canada s combat role in afghanistan and 
 for all intended purposes is on a war footing we can see that in the daily operations now being conducted 
 in afghanistan we can also see it in the way the regimental family and indeed the country has rallied to 
 support the troops in the field whether it be the rear parties working to care for family members and provide 
 the vital link back home or the ppcli association who have stepped up to provide support to our wounded through 
 their op small pack program those of us on the home front are keenly committed to supporting the frontline troops 
 in whatever way we can it should be heartening to those in afghanistan and elsewhere on operations that their rear 
 is secure and well looked after it is good to see all elements of the regiment caring and supporting each 
 other in this time of war this year of the veteran edition of the patrician is dedicated to those vets 
 who have served in wars and operations it is important to ensure that their efforts and sacrifices not be forgotten 
 just as the regimental family is rallying to support the troops on today s frontlines we will continue to honour 
 and support those who came before us after all we will all belong to the old guard at some point 
 and will look to the fresher faces of the regiment to support us it is a continuum of service and 
 support that goes unbroken 
 the patrician 2005 4 looking back 55 years in the year of the veteran by john r bishop president pacific 
 region korea veterans association of canada it is an appropriate time to look back to june 25th 1950 when north 
 korea attacked south across the 38th parallel into the republic of korea exactly 55 years ago in the month of 
 august canada raised an infantry brigade group of almost all boys not yet 21 years of age with little or 
 no military experience these young men were led by a small number of outstanding and experienced world war ii officers 
 and senior non commissioned officers it is hard to believe that barely three months after answering the call the first 
 contingent would depart from fort lewis in november on a troop ship the private joe p martinez sailing from seattle 
 washington it would be an error not to record that in july 1950 the royal canadian navy committed three destroyers 
 and an royal canadian air force transport squadron canada had allowed the army to reduce its numbers after world war 
 ii to between 5 000 and 7 000 front line fighting soldiers therefore canada could not afford to risk our 
 regular army they would be required to train and augment the more than twenty thousand who would serve in the 
 korean war in the land battle before the cease fire on 25 ju1y1953 in addition another 7 000 soldiers would 
 serve on peacekeeping duties after the armistice agreement until 1955 at the risk of alienating or not giving well deserved 
 praise to all those who served in the land battle during the war i find it hard to believe today 
 that the initial infantry battalion that i served with was in korea six months prior to the arrival of the 
 balance of 25 canadian infantry brigade group 2nd battalion princess patricia s canadian light infantry four months after our arrival 
 in country fought a significant battle at kapyong gapyong in april 1951 that resulted in the awarding of a united 
 states presidential citation princess patricia s canadian light infantry year of the veteran respect admiration and gratitude to all canadian 
 military veterans we thank you for your service and acknowledge the courage and honour in which you ve served your 
 country compliments of a friend of the regiment sinclair sss supply ltd 60 i hj serving h v a c 
 r s t contractors since 1946 
 5 the patrician 2005 all canadian units served honourably in korea canada s third bloodiest conflict 516 servicemen made the 
 supreme sacrifice 1558 were wounded not to mention the thousands who would be recognized today in a special category not 
 recognized in the early fifties post traumatic stress disorder ptsd or as it was called in world war i and 
 11 shell shock the army suffered more than 500 of the fatal casualties and a comparable number in the wounded 
 category as an old infantryman i must record that approximately 85 of the casualties in korea were in the infantry 
 this fact should be recorded in the year of the veteran so that we realize that our front line troops 
 of any type should be remembered in a realistic context many citizens of victoria noticed korea veteran association members recently 
 just over a dozen strong parading in the annual victoria day parade again over fifty years since the cessation of 
 fighting in korea their numbers are declining all too frequently due to death and physical impairment they march proudly in 
 the parade but are thankful that the route is not ten kilometers long it is also an appropriate opportunity to 
 recognize at this time a joint project by a 60 000 strong korean canadian community and the city of burnaby 
 to erect a substantial memorial in burnaby the korean canadian community remembers the contribution of canadian soldiers not unlike the 
 citizens of holland in world war 11 thirty six young men from british columbia who made the supreme sacrifice during 
 the korean conflict will have their names chiseled on this memorial in burnaby the ground breaking ceremony for this project 
 was held at 1100 hours on september 17th at central park in burnaby the burnaby ground breaking ceremony was well 
 attended by over 200 people including 20 canadian korea war veterans we were all honoured by the attendance of mr 
 choi the korean consul general mr corrigan the mayor of the city of burnaby and ms roosa city of burnaby 
 chair of commission more than a dozen important dignitaries were present including members of parliament association presidents committee chair persons 
 and many noteworthy spectators including members of the korean canadian community mr yang j shin chair of the korean war 
 memorial project committee announced that the unveiling ceremony will be in october 2006 another project of interest to british columbia 
 residents was a small ceremony held in fort lewis washington on september 10th this year almost exactly 55 years since 
 our soldiers commenced their 18 month enlistment in the canadian army special force to serve in korea a group of 
 korean war veterans from british columbia primarily from victoria gathered at the fort 
 the patrician 2005 6 lewis museum to place three impressive bronze plaques recognizing the more than 5 000 who served 
 in washington state before going to korea the display included copies of five different books written by canadian soldiers who 
 served in korea including two of them who retired near victoria mr jeffrey parker consul general of canada who resides 
 in seattle washington was the senior canadian dignitary attending the ceremony mr alan archambault museum curator made all the necessary 
 arrangements for the ceremony ensured u s korean war veterans were in attendance and personally conducted an outstanding tour of 
 his facility the three plaques including one which is a replica of the memorial in pusan busan korea where 378 
 of the 516 who died in korea are buried the remaining 138 are buried at a number of locations including 
 yokohama japan where they died from wounds suffered in korea tragically one train carrying members of the royal canadian horse 
 artillery to fort lewis was in a head on collision with another train at canoe river b c on november 
 21st 1950 that crash resulted in the death of 17 soldiers and four airmen and injured another 49 eg 
 7 the patrician 2005 the two largest plaques to be unveiled in fort lewis are identical one in english and 
 one in french the memorial s main plaques read members of the korea veterans association kva are planning to erect 
 a large memorial beside highway 1 5 with access to land donated by fort lewis the three bronze plaques will 
 be placed on the memorial along with other smaller plaques recognizing significant events including the canoe river collision and the 
 patricia s epic stand at kapyong hopefully when we look back in 2010 60 years after the commencement of the 
 korean war tourists will be attracted to the site of an impressive memorial beside the highway with canada chiseled at 
 the top in bold black letters a few may choose to turn off highway i 5 and read the plaques 
 donated by friends of kva in conclusion as this is the year of the veteran in canada it is also 
 important to remember all canadian veterans from all wars peacekeeping type missions and other types of duty where our servicemen 
 and servicewomen serve around the world

 the patrician 2005 15 visit of queen elizabeth ii to the ppcli gallery 25 may 2005 major rod middleton msm 
 cd ret d in march of 2005 i was advised that i had been appointed as host to the queen 
 and the duke of edinburgh for a private tour of the ppcli gallery at the museum of the regiments during 
 their visit to calgary on 25 may the duty would be shared with major general bob stewart cmm cd ret 
 d colonel of the regiment i was thrilled by the news and immediately set about planning how i would conduct 
 the tour i was told that 10 5 minutes had been set aside for the gallery tour and as a 
 guided tour of the gallery that i had been giving over the past years had been taking at least an 
 hour depending on the interest shown by the visitor i was quite concerned as how to condense the tour my 
 first effort was to time the length of all the audio and video presentations to determine which could be used 
 i then prioritized the information that i felt was paramount to the patricia story and then set out to practice 
 knowing that the colonel of the regiment would be taking part i had to consider what role he would play 
 on 10 march the official royal visit reconnaissance party arrived at the museum for a walk through of the program 
 forty people arrived by charter coach direct from the airport including a party of seven from buckingham palace federal and 
 provincial government officials and security officials once the details for the arrival of the royal party had been reviewed i 
 was next on deck i was introduced to mr christopher geidt obe assistant private secretary to the queen and together 
 with his party of scotland yard and rcmp security branch and several others i set about my guided tour i 
 pointed out that due to the time restraints it would be necessary to limit the tour to significant events in 
 the history of the regiment with emphasis on our ties to royalty through our first colonel in chief princess patricia 
 and our current colonel in chief countess mountbatten of burma a cousin of the queen the tour went well i 
 answered questions from mr geidt pointed out the displays that we would have to bypass and finished the tour only 
 thirty seconds over the allotted time later i met with him to confirm whether i would have sound and video 
 systems on or off and the matter of the difficult footing in the ww i trench display his decision was 
 to operate the gallery as it would be for the school children that visit and to warn her majesty about 
 the duck board footing in the bunker he thanked me for a concise overview of the regiment s history the 
 entourage 
 the patrician 2005 16 left the gallery with many kind comments on the quality and effectiveness of the displays m 
 in the weeks leading up the royal tour museum staff members warrant officer darcy wanvig sergeant rick walker and myself 
 set about on a thorough cleaning of all displays leather and brass were given a good polishing and all the 
 displays were cleaned with the assistance of curator ms lynn bullock a new display was created for the visit a 
 large carved ppcli cap badge the founder s portrait the colonel in chief s portrait and the ppcli association carved 
 crest flanked a five by seven foot photo enlargement of the queen s presentation of new colours to 1 ppcli 
 at beacon hill park victoria 17 july 1959 the queen s and regimental colours together with the actual kneeling stools 
 used on the parade completed the display the day prior to the visit i met with general stewart and with 
 notes and stopwatch in hand we rehearsed the tour after several attempts to meet the time limitations we agreed that 
 we would cover only the essentials from our own knowledge and be prepared to answer any questions that might arise 
 the hours leading up to the visit were filled by security staff carrying out inspection of the gallery led by 
 their calgary police service handlers three different dogs sniffed their way through the displays on separate tours when i asked 
 why three inspections were necessary i was told that different dogs smelled different things obviously nothing was left to chance 
 meanwhile the museum foyer was filling with the military personnel who would be taking their places for their official group 
 photos with their colonel in chief officers and senior ncos of the king s own calgary regiment the calgary highlanders 
 and 33 field engineer squadron took their places invited military and civilian guests moved to their assigned places and general 
 stewart and i moved into the ppcli gallery with warrant officer wanvig and sergeant walker manning the doors we stood 
 by soon the motorcade arrived in a roar of a j police motorcycle escort we watched as the royal couple 
 arrived to be greeted by the official party including regimental major ted giraldeau in his capacity as chairman of the 
 board of directors of the museum of the regiments our gallery doors closed and we waited with the photo shoot 
 completed the doors opened and general stewart and i sprang to attention saluted and bade them welcome the queen and 
 prince philip shook our hands in greeting and the tour was on great interest was expressed by the queen in 
 the wwi bunker and the headstone of the unknown sergeant when we got to the wwii battle of britain video 
 i asked her majesty if she would be so kind to confirm if it was she who appeared in the 
 video with another young woman member of the army territorial service running from a bunker to crew an anti aircraft 
 gun i ran the video and in the first ten seconds the scene appeared both prince philip and the queen 
 stated that oh no she had been an ambulance driver in the war moving on we quickly covered the wwii 
 korea and peacekeeping displays to arrive at the new display where the royal couple graciously posed for a group photo 
 a stop in the memorial hall of honour and a look at our three victoria crosses completed the tour on 
 leaving the queen remarked that the gallery is really well done and thank you both general stewart and i then 
 stood aside as the accompanying entourage filed out the door deputy prime minister anne mclellan thanked me and remarked that 
 she must return the queen s equerry thanked us for saving two and a half minutes on the tour and 
 the last to leave mr christopher geidt thanked me for saving them time and for my remembering to warn her 
 majesty about the bad footing in the bunker general stewart shook my hand and the royal visit was over i 
 shall treasure always the honour afforded me editor s note maj rod middleton ret d is a tireless volunteer at 
 the museum of the regiments and routinely provides guided historical tours to all ages he is a veteran of 2

 17 the patrician 2005 the regimental museum and archives much of the first half of 2005 was spent in preparation 
 for the artefact collection storage move renovations to the basement area of the museum of the regiments were completed in 
 may 2005 and all of the regimental museums spent a portion of the summer moving their collections downstairs the ppcli 
 regimental museum artefact collection was moved in august and in october a new space saver moveable art storage unit was 
 installed to house the framed art collection the main advantage of the new storage facility is that the increased square 
 footage ensures that artefacts are more accessible than they were in the much smaller upstairs storage area on the 25th 
 of may 2005 her majesty queen elizabeth ii and his royal highness prince phillip the duke of edinburgh attended the 
 museum of the regiments during their short visit to calgary during the whirlwind visit her majesty sat for photographs with 
 three of her regiments and was taken on a brief tour of the ppcli gallery in preparation of her majesty 
 s visit a temporary display was set up in the gallery featuring the presentation of her colours to the first 
 battalion 17 july 1959 at the end of the visit her majesty unveiled a commemorative plaque renaming the museum atrium 
 the queen elizabeth ii atrium in june a new rotating display was installed in the old colours case located in

 the patrician 2005 22 ivp 1 ppcli dares to prepare 2005 was a year with acute focus for 1 ppcli 
 with op archer on the horizon a lot of training and preparation had to be done before we were combat 
 ready with lcol lan hope and rsm randy northrup at the helm we navigated some rough seas over the course 
 of the year but it came together in the end if there is a major theme that runs through each 
 company s take on the year it can be summed up by bobby knight s maxim the will to win 
 is not as important as the will to prepare to win red devils rule the ground amongst other things the 
 red devils ruled the ground that was 2005 with the upcoming mission in afghanistan focussing training the company gained a 
 new collective skill set drawing on the experience of its soldiers and the lessons learned from overseas with a new 
 chief devil the company prepared itself for its work overseas maj quealey handed over the reins and the pitchfork to 
 maj gallinger part way through the year and a coy bid adieu to the man who lit the flames again 
 in a coy s lines maj quealey and csm leger brought the proud name of the red devils to prominence 
 again and the cq has made a lot of money off of the resulting merchandising with the company battle cry 
 once again ringing through the battalion s hangar after guiding a coy through its rebuilding stages where the skills to 
 fight with the lav were honed maj qulealey moved on to become the 1 cmbg g 3 and the newly 
 minted maj gallinger took over in anticipation of op archer ex spring ram was the first major exercise of the 
 year where ivp had the dual task of training itself to level 4 live and helping prepare 3vp for their 
 mission in afghanistan the highlight of that ex was sgt proctor s dirkaville town a replica of what the 3vp 
 soldiers would be operating in overseas complete with role players and goats sgt proctor set a standard that will be 
 emulated by cmtc in realistic training his insurgents intransient tribal leaders and goat riots raised some eyebrows and caused some 
 fits it also taught some harsh lessons which benefited those deploying and satisfied sgt proctor s sadistic streak and for 
 information of the scott proctor canadian institute for the elimination of stupidity just ask him for his manifesto after summer 
 leave the red devils geared up for ex phoenix ram which would serve as the last major training event before 
 deployment there soldiers at all levels were put through their paces in a realistic environment this included pi comds getting 
 their orders five 
 23 the patrician 2005 a e ivp minutes before h hour and running down their line of lavs in the 
 rain yelling move now grid to follow to both the weary looks and l told you so smiles of their 
 ncos the red devils learned that there are limits and found ways around them as exemplified by their hectic hell 
 day when they attacked three objectives in succession even in this day and age with sas digital secure comms and 
 satellite imagery nothing in this power point world can replace the guts and leadership found at all levels right down 
 to the fire team throughout phoenix ram the red devils made this point daily with op archer on the horizon 
 the red devils prepared to deploy during the balance of 2005 with little false bravado but a great sense of 
 purpose with a mission that has great strategic import as well as the potential positive impact on the people of 
 afghanistan the red devils went into christmas well aware of what was on their shoulders but ground was made to 
 be ruled and it doesn t matter to the red devils where it is god speed to all and as 
 csm leger says red devil out bulldogs in business 2005 was a busy year for b company 1 ppcli the 
 year began in afghanistan with the company deployed on op athena roto 2 upon returning to canada in february the 
 soldiers of b coy enjoyed a well deserved period of leave before falling back into a regular routine of training 
 and exercises beginning in april b coy participated in the trials for the dfs team including a jcats exercise ex 
 combined strike and a garrison exercise ex worthy strike in may and june the battalion deployed to wainwright on ex 
 spring ram there we had the opportunity to run platoon level live fire ranges in order to assist a and

 company deployed to golden b c to run a basic mountain h operations course following summer leave b coy departed 
 for banff to carry out a adventure training ex bulldog trek was undertaken to provide a positive final collective k 
 experience for a tight knit group of soldiers and officers before a battalion re organization the tt exercise consisted of 
 a 105 km hike in the mountains surrounding lake minnewanka including tl hiking to the 8000 ft summit of black 
 rock mountain over the course of 6 days mountains were scaled rivers crossed blisters born and war stories hatched a 
 short visit by the cq staff a with a canteen filled full of beer and steak on day 3 had 
 a miraculous effect on morale not to tt mention boosting the cq s reputation august through to november saw a 
 return to conventiona c training with lav gunner plq and pswq courses in november soldiers deployed to cmtc v as 
 part of the sat 2 trial of the weapons effects simulator which will form the basis of future e validations 
 of units deploying on operations participants had the opportunity to use the wes v equipment while acting as enemy force 
 and wreaking havoc on the helpless citizens of stromia charlie good to go you could say the theme for 2005 
 for c company was afghanistan having known for a year that our battalion was going to travel to afghanistan in 
 the early part of 2006 we made sure that all events and training had this in mind from the pcf 
 primary combat function cycle at the beginning of the year to the tmst theatre mission specific training at the end 
 of the year our mission was always the primary focus after christmas our pcf cycle started and it revolved around 
 the lav 111 after having a limited number of personnel qualified to use the lav 111 the previous year c 
 company made sure that there would be plenty of qualified people this year there were gunner courses and driver courses 
 running from mid january until the end march and all these soldiers were able to make use of their new 
 found skills during the remainder of the year soldier skills were tested as well during the pswq platoon support weapon 
 qualification course and the basic recce course that also took place in february and march these skills were also put 
 to the test especially during ex spring ram 
 the patrician 2005 26 ivp may brought ex spring ram where we practiced new skills and old tricks and to 
 j help prepare 3vp for their upcoming mission to afghanistan in 2005 the exercise started with the usual weapons ranges 
 and then we expanded from pairs level live fire to company level live fire ranges the first part of the 
 month had us practicing dismounted attacks so that we could prove a live fire company range for 3 vp to 
 use as part of their training after the weapons ranges c company helped set up prepare and move into the 
 village known as six hills located on range 16 in wainwright each person had a role to play in the 
 village and at other locations where similar training was ongoing there were many lectures given to us on how locals 
 from afghanistan act and how they interact with coalition forces in their country this gave us a better understanding of 
 what we would be heading into and how to deal with situations that left 3 vp scratching there heads and 
 trying again after this portion of the exercise we moved to section attacks but this time mounted in our lav 
 ill s once the exercise was done at the end of may there was a whole month to prepare for 
 summer leave in july ex executive hunter 2005 after summer leave c company started training right away knowing that there 
 would not be that much time to fit all the things required to learn in the short amount of time 
 left august brought a lot of personal weapons training and a new concept called the gun fighter program using a 
 program developed from some of the senior staff at 3 vp and other outside sources c company started teaching this 
 new program as well the end of the month brought the mountain man competition there were a lot of participants 
 from across the battalion and 1 vp c company included did very well this year all this geared c company 
 up for the two upcoming months which brought us to our longest exercise in years during september and october 1 
 cmbg traveled to wainwright to commence the brigade training event called ex phoenix ram this exercise began with weapons ranges 
 and personal skills and worked its way up to combat team attacks this was an opportunity for it company to 
 practice old skills and learn new ones including some night live fire ranges all of this training led up to 
 brigade level training which had all the battalion running at full steam this was a new thing for a lot 
 of people who haven t experienced this level of training before upon redeploying back to edmonton there wasn t a 
 moment of respite due to the limited amount of training time available and so much left to accomplish after a 
 furious few days of post exercise drills tmst training commenced everything from cultural briefings to negotiations november and december have 
 been incredible busy but all this will be worth it when we deploy to afghanistan in 2006 
 the patrician 2005 27 ivp what s in a name cbt sp hq coy marches on combat support company had 
 a busy year in 2005 with several activities and two name changes the coy initially was going to be called 
 istar coy then the name was to hq coy for op archer roto 1 despite what we are called the 
 company remained operationally focused and we eagerly accepted all tasks with vigour the focus on training was for the deployment 
 to afghanistan with special attention being paid to counter insurgency operations and the integration of 12 rbc assets having mastered 
 our skills the company is ready and eager to assume the ao in rc south recce pi had a robust 
 trg year that saw the pi conduct a rigorous patrolling exercise in vernon and kamloops ex spartan ascent began to 
 prepare recce pi for the challenges to be faced on op archer in afghanistan section were tasked with establishing ops 
 in adverse terrain that culminated in a successful platoon size raid on an insurgent camp insurgency warfare continued for recce 
 pi during ex spring ram only from the other side of the fence recce pi provided 3 ppcli with a 
 formidable insurgent force in the wainwright freedom fighters wff this enabled recce pi to employ some real time insurgent tactics 
 to best train the prt leaving for afghanistan immediately after the exercise recce pi returned to bc and completed a 
 basic mountain operations course in golden qualifying the entire platoon on the bte the platoon further refined their skills by 
 conducting an integrated istar exercise with 12 sigs pi deployed on ex spring ram and ex phoenix ram the pi 
 established the bn hq and provided support via the lcis rrb line crypto co s tac and signals training sections 
 the new cp complex provided several challenges during the initial set up despite not having conducted a movement exercise in 
 recent memory step up drills went exceedingly well and by the end of the ex the platoon was extremely proficient 
 during the year members of sigs pi attended and taught numerous courses in preparation for afghanistan which included an prc 
 117 courses in rochester new york in march and november as well sigs pi sent pte williams to belgium in 
 november and december as a member of the canadian forces cism basketball team this past year was very active for 
 1 ppcli snipers with the addition of five newly qualified snipers the section currently stands at nine members our primary 
 focus was increasing the number of qualified snipers in the battalion two basic sniper serials were 
 the patrician 200 28 ivp conducted at cfb dundurn sk nearly 40 candidates were selected on both serials and approximately 
 50 were successful this holds true that the sniper qualification is still amongst the most difficult to achieve in the 
 cf despite that the courses run contained some of the highest pass percentages which is a credit to the professional 
 and knowledgeable instructors from across the western area 1 ppcli snipers participated in two international sniper competitions at gagetown new 
 brunswick and fort benning georgia the competitions concentrated on sniper specific operations which provided excellent training value and facilitated liaison 
 among international sniper communities conversion training for our new medium range sniper weapon 338 timber wolf is still in the

 31 the patrician 200 the history of taps i too have felt the chills while listening to taps but i 
 have never seen all the words to the song until now i didn t even know there was more than 
 one verse i also never knew the story behind the song and i didn t know if you had either 
 so i thought i d pass it along i now have an even deeper respect for the song than i 
 did before reportedly it all began in 1862 during the civil war when union army captain robert ellicombe was with 
 his men near harrisons landing in virginia the confederate army was on the other side of the narrow strip of 
 land during the night captain ellicombe heard the moans of a soldier who lay severely wounded on the field not 
 knowing if it was a union or confederate soldier the captain decided to risk his life and bring the stricken 
 man back for medical attention crawling on his stomach through the gunfire the captain reached the stricken soldier and begai 
 pulling him toward his encampment when the captain finally reached his own lines he discovered it was actually a confederate 
 soldier but the soldier was dead the captain lit a lantern and suddenly caught his breath and went numb with 
 shock in the dim light he saw the face of the soldier it was his owr son the boy had 
 been studying music in the south when the war broke out and without telling his father the boy enlisted in 
 the confederate army the following morning heartbroken the father asked permission of his superiors to give his son a full 
 military burial despite his enemy status his request was only partially granted the captain had asked if he could have 
 a group of army band members play a funeral dirge for his son at the funeral the request was turned 
 down since the soldier was a confederate but out of respect for the father they did say they could give 
 him only one musician the captain chose a bugler he asked the bugler to play a series of musical notes 
 he had found on a piece of paper in the pocket of the dead youth s uniform this wish was 
 granted the haunting melody we now know as taps used at military funerals was born the words are day is 
 done gone the sun from the lakes from the hills from the sky all is well safely rest god is 
 nigh fading light dims the sight and a star gems the sky gleaming bright from afar drawing nigh falls the 
 night thanks and praise for our days neath the sun neath the stars neath the sky as we go this 
 we know god is nigh remember those lost and harmed while serving their country and also those presently serving in

 playing extremely well and winning gold members of the 2 ppcli volleyball team went on to form the core of 
 the base shilo team that competed in and won the cf national championship the battalion s hockey team played well 
 throughout the tournamert only to lose a heartbreaker in overtime in the semi finals the floor hockey team had an 
 excellent showing placing second the soccer team found itself in a tough pool with the team from batus the team 
 missed the playoffs by one win however they were the only team to score a single goal against batus an 
 accomplishment worthy of note despite a valiant effort the broomball squad suffered a tough loss in the semis and placed 
 fourth the regina pats of the whl visited 2 ppcli between games with the brandon wheat kings in february taking 
 advantage of their off day and became acquainted with the regiment and their team s namesake the players were given

 enthusiastically received by the young players following a team practice at gunner arena children from the base were invited to 
 skate with the pats many received pats memorabilia collected signatures and posed for photos with their favourite players regimental day 
 was again a highlight for the second battalion the day was naturally filled with camaraderie and broom i 100 while 
 winning and losing is not as important as the esprit de corps fostered on this day for posterity it should 
 be noted that the victors were alpha company the ptes cpls and the officers 
 the patrician 2005 34 2 vp april may r after a busy pcf cycle 2 ppcli conducted ex robust patricia 
 in shilo after completing ibts for all members of the battalion we deployed to the training area and the further 
 honing of collective dismounted and lav skills and ttps the latter was something not practised since the unit moved to 
 shilo in the summer 2004 the training involved a lav gun camp the conduct of ranges from static shoots for 
 individual vehicle crews to live fire platoon attacks and dry company attacks this training culminated with a three day battalion 
 mechanized ftx prior to the may long weekend many lessons were learned and further aided in the battalion s focus 
 of professionalizing lav skills all agreed that it was a great end to a long training period the newer soldiers 
 in the battalion were also introduced to springtime in shilo snow and poison ivy snc tec 5 montee des arsenaux

 the patrician 2005 35 2vp june with the arrival of summer came further poison ivy related maladies and inevitably individual 
 tasks it was also an opportunity for the battalion to conduct section and platoon level urban operations training the skills 
 of sgt mike forest as an instructor and sgt ron sargent as a pioneer were put to good use and 
 achieved exceptional results after a couple weeks of training in sgt sargent s kill house the soldiers were a little 
 bruised and battered from the simunition and lumber but much wiser in the conduct operations in an urban environment july 
 summer leave unless you were on a task 
 the patrician 2005 36 2 vp august once summer leave finished the second battalion shifted its focus to two events 
 ex mountain man and preparations for all of the collective training planned for the fall the 2 ppcli mountain man 
 team deployed to edmonton as a well trained and extremely well prepared group for the brigade s annual competition they 
 returned as the major unit champions with some noteworthy individual performances specifically mcpl al verzyl was the fastest competitor in 
 the masters category for the second year in row as well as 2 overall and cpl kevin cochrane completed the 
 course with the most improved time from last year s event congratulations to all members of the team as they 
 all completed the gruelling competition september the battalion deployed to the field in shilo for two weeks in early september 
 for ex phoenix patricia the majority of the exercise focused on the conduct of live fire ranges including pairs section 
 and culminated with a platoon range using lavs and supporting indirect fire from b bty 1 rcha the exercise concluded 
 with an assault on an insurgent strongpoint in the village of riderville the scenario tested the ability to conduct operations 
 across the full spectrum of conflict and useful lessons were learned and the importance of the strategic corporal was certainly 
 reinforced this training prepared the soldiers of the battalion for what awaited in wainwright and the brigade training event bte 
 it was during exercise phoenix patricia that the decision was made that bravo company would be deploying to afghanistan in 
 january 2006 with 1 ppcli this was welcomed news for the company and reinforced the importance of the fall s 
 training plan october the second battalion complete deployed to wainwright in late september for the i cmbg bte ex phoenix 
 ram and were not home again until the week before trick or treating during this time in wainwright each of 
 the companies completed brigade directed stand training focussed on full spectrum operations the highlight had to be brian the lama 
 and culminated in a company level live fire range as part of the bte the soldiers of 2 ppcli less 
 bravo company then transitioned to opfor in support of work up training for the forces deploying to afghanistan the highlight 
 was alpha company s brilliant tactical execution of the massacre at six hills after this we broke out our civics 
 and assumed the role of noncombatants 0:non 0:combatants and belligerents for the final phase of the work up training the 
 scope of operations and tasks performed by the soldiers of the second battalion and complexity of many of the 
 37 the patrician 2005 2 vp i ranges during the bte served to make this a memorable event for all 
 we again truly p learned the training value and bruising effect of simunition c t november the month of november 
 can be described in three ways sat 2 tmsbp and moosimii with administration company having supported all three of these 
 operations at the same time alpha company went back to wainwright at the end of the first week and did 
 not return until the first of december they took part in the next stage of the instrumented system trial for 
 cmtc a k a sat 2 and were able to experience the true joy of late fall early winter in 
 this particular part of alberta notwithstanding the joys of unlimited access to meatco jerky the younger soldiers of alpha company 
 may now have a better appreciation with an entire fall spe in wainwright of the old dogs war stories surrounding 
 two month deployments on rvs the remainder of the battalion stayed in shilo and supported bravo company s tmsbp son 
 of tmst training in preparation for their january 2006 deployment this was a period where charlie company s expertise and 
 enthusiasm for reflexive shooting enhanced driving and counter ambush drills paid huge dividends for the soldiers of bravo company those 
 going ove to train the afghan national army and those who will be working in the nse this year s 
 remembrance day activities were special as the spirit of 2005 the year of the veteran was at the forefront the 
 second battalion provided a full guard on the base shilo parade and bravo company sent a contingent to ceremonies in 
 moosimin sk the town where major g h harry mullen one of the regiment s three victoria cross winners is 
 buried this was an opportunity for the members of 5 platoon to appreciate our regiment s past and celebrate with 
 surviving veterans they all agreed that they would not soon forget the experiences of that day december as the year 
 drew to a close and preparations for the christmas season were well underway the second battalion received news of the 
 formal decision that alpha company would be deploying with 1 rcr in august of 2006 to afghanistan much to the

 all of the company s soldiers were tasked to support ex phoenix ram the brigade training event as range staff 
 for level 5 live fire training sgt cooper s stand was particularly challenging revealing our need to rehearse our medical 
 standard operating procedures more frequently a company conducted ex winter patricia in dundurn saskatchewan in order to prepare for our

 company conducted a basic mountain operations course and a mountain operations exercise at the usmc mountain warfare training center mwtc 
 located near bridgeport california the focus was the bmo qualification additionally we conducted mountain mobility training that had personnel snowshoeing 
 skiing and hauling ten man tent groups around the mountains the marines observed and shook their heads at us as 
 their tents are considerably smaller and lighter being designed for the mountains shortly after our return from california we were 
 given the news that we would form the basis for the patrol company of the kandahar prt with newly developed 
 tactics techniques and procedures and a new mission focus we completed a short theatre mission specific training tmst package and 
 were declared opred upon arrival in afghanistan in july we immediately assumed security tasks for the prt camp as well 
 as taking over convoy escort tasks the first two months were hectic improving the camp presence patrolling escorting vif and 
 bringing in the equipment and personnel needed to sustain the mission unlike many other operations that company personnel have deployed 
 on previously th mission had the unique dangers of improvised explosive devices ieds and suicide bombers to date the enemy 
 has attacked patrol coy five times in addition to those attacks one potenti attack was foiled and several ieds were 
 found in the area of operations before they could be employed we have suffered five personnel seriously wounded and one 
 civilian member of the prt was killed capt manuel panchana moya and pte ryan crawford both suffered significant leg and

 the majority of the company either as instructors or as candidates in frder to prepare for the up coming year 
 as individual training and instruction wound down c coy began to prepare for upcoming neo and iru tasks march april 
 2005 was the highlight as c coy deployed to california to train with the 13th marine expeditionary unit this outstanding 
 exercise was valuable because it focused on developing and improving individual and collective skills in urban warfare the lessons learned 
 were extremely valuable and the marines were very forthcoming with their experiences and knowledge gained from iraq in late april 
 c coy deployed to wainwright for ex light fighter the first half focused on a series of dry and live 
 field firing these ranges increased the soldier s confidence in their individual and collective skills the second half consisted of 
 scenarios that one may expect to face while deployed overseas the exercise culminated in a battalion attack on an enemy 
 village and terrorist training camp which put to the test all our skills and capabilities 
 49 the patrician 2005 3 vp in june we helped prepare b coy for the prt mission in afghanistan the 
 result was a weeklong exercise focused on section level scenarios that included convoy escort yip escort and inter action with 
 the local population after an incident it was a valuable experience that gave all involved the opportunity to learn while 
 watching other soldiers and leaders dealt with difficult situation by thinkina outside the box before a well earned summer vacation 
 we prepared for the first special service force fssf reunion in calgary this reunion was especially important as it was 
 to be the devils brigade s second last reunion and the last one in canada for c coy it was 
 a great privilege to participate and support this reunion september s focus was preparation for the bte in wainwright c 
 coy s role was to organize a stand revolving around a terrorist training camp imbedded within a local village th 
 s 1 forced commanders to develop a plan that would achieve their objective while minimizing the negative affects on the 
 village these preparations were interrupted by a tragic accident when 3ppcli s unit embarkation officer ueo wo sheppard passed away 
 while training in trenton this struck c coy especially hard because of our close ties with wo sheppard wo sheppard 
 will be tail missed but never forgotten by c coy while in wainwright 9 pi c coy received word that 
 they would be deploying to kabul to provide a security force for camp julien the soldiers had no problems providing

 running in january 2005 and never looked back the new year started with the stand up of surge 05 task 
 force and the creation of the first of the new forward support group fsg constructed to provide both integral and 
 second thirdline 0:second 0:third 0:line support the stand up of the fsg required the bulk of administration company to augment 
 shortfalls in the available service battalion manning as a result the fsg became a composite sub unit containing a mix 
 of maintainers supply technicians cooks and clerks from both units the requirement to man the fsg as our first priority 
 left the bare minimum of personnel

 the first two weeks focused on individual training including mloc with the fsg leadership concurrently developing concepts and sops for 
 the provision of combat service support to the task force those sops were tested and refined during the tactical portion 
 of exercise light fighter upon completion of the two exercises it was announced that a provincial reconstruction team prt based 
 on b company group would be deploying to afghanistan in august this deployment required a tailored fsg minus rather than

 a good taste of the full range of integral support functions performed by administration company on a day to day 
 basis looking back at just a few of the highlights of 2005 the company ran several driver courses and provided 
 transport logistics and maintenance support to numerous ranges company level exercises and unit level courses all which was done in 
 typical administration company style with service second to none looking to the future 2006 will see third battalion s administration 
 company maintain a high tempo consistent with the remainder of the unit support to a heavy primary combat function training 
 cycle will keep our personnel busy throughout the january to march timeframe that will be followed by support to several 
 rifle company exercises in the arctic and british columbia and then the stand up of task force 2 07 once 
 again we will augment the task force fsg with key personnel with the remainder of the company falling under 3

 then deployed on ex spring ram light fighter and the platoons were given ar opportunity to conduct platoon tasks in 
 support of the task force signals platoon the highlight of 2005 was the deployment of fifteen members of the platoon 
 with the provincial reconstruction team in kandahar the majority of them are patrol signalers and they did a superb job 
 of training their section on the operations and maintenance of the communications equipment while also performing the usual duties required 
 of patrol members at home the rest of the platoon concentrated their efforts on preparing future tasks forces for upcoming 
 deployments in september the platoon went on a week long adventure training in the banff national park this was an 
 opportunity to reinforce team cohesion through challenging and fun outdoor activities the upcoming year will certainly be as interesting as 
 we prepare our unit for a possible deployment to second line theatre in february 2007 recce platoon 2005 was a 
 busy year in recce platoon the year started with a basic recce patrolman course which brought new troops to the 
 platoon immediately afterwards we sent them on their basic sniper course in dundurn where we had huge success the brigade 
 exercise was an excellent challenge for the platoon keeping us awake and wet throughout we also managed to get a 
 fair number of jumps off which included two water jumps into lac ste anne after summer leave we ran the 
 pre pathfinder course in elk island where we were waste deep in sludge for a week one troop even climbed 
 up a tree after being chased by a buffalo after the pre pathfinder we sent two candidates to trenton where 
 they both successfully earned their torches at the end of the year a couple of troops had the privilege of 
 going to fort lewis washington for the annual menton day s celebration receiving their american wings 2006 promises to be 
 just as busy if not busier with courses exercises and pre deployment training for a hopeful tour in february 2007 
 weapons platoon weapons platoon has had an interesting and busy twelve months january started out with the platoon running back 
 to back machine gun courses for the battalion these courses re introduced the 50 cal hmg to the next generation 
 of machine gunners during ex spring ram light fighter 05 the platoon conducted both mounted and dismounted live fire ranges 
 with the 50 cal and the c 6 gpmg it was during the mounted ranges that weapons platoon demonstrated the 
 ability of the luvw c r to handle heavy support weapons weapons platoon conducted dismounted live fire training and was 
 broken down into fire support elements for the rifle companies during their attacks during this range the weapons sections attached 
 to both b company and c company man packed 50 cal hmgs throughout the entire 15 km trace this exercise 
 was also the first time the unit employed the luvw c r as a mobile fire support vehicle upon arriving 
 back in edmonton weapons platoon was informed they would deploy as part of the operation archer provincial reconstruction team theatre 
 activation team prt tat arriving in kandahar the platoon quickly linked up with the american tf gun devil in order 
 to recce the routes that would take us out to the prt location in kandahar city sgt bibby and mcpl 
 broggi both became so infatuated with sgt mahoney a female us army mp who chewed tobacco and swore like a 
 sailor that they pressured the pi comd to specifically request her presence on all joint patrols during the orientation brief 
 to kandahar we were informed that there hadn t been a rocket attack in over 14 months however we soon 
 realized that nothing could be taken for 
 the patrician 2005 54 3vp granted in afghanistan because three rockets impacted the camp at 0400 hrs the next morning 
 platoon members are still suffering after seeing mcpl frank running to the bunker j in only his combat boots and 
 boxers the only major problems that we encountered while in kandahar was trying to find out where wo devine was 
 always hiding and trying to coax him back to work on our way home mcpl aube had a hard time 
 understanding that the two beer per day policy was not in effect after returning home the platoon spent a month 
 on post deployment leave when we returned to work in october we were greeted with a number of the platoon

 i had the pleasure of taking command from lcol bryan bailey during a hectic summer and hit the ground running 
 in addition to conducting a wide variety of courses throughout the year in wainwright the training centre also oversaw reserve 
 summer training in chilliwack edmonton dundern shilo and winnipeg complicating things somewhat the unit had to deal with splitting western 
 area training centre base wainwright into two separate units with the creation of asu wainwright a unit change of command 
 and a move into a new building from the outset rsm mcnaughton and i have been very pleased and proud 
 of the work achieved by the training centre to provide individual training support to western area including 1 cmbg and 
 the three patricia battalions my focus as commanding officer has been to continue the great work started by my predecessors 
 by creating a healthy and operationally focussed training climate to this end we are looking wherever possible to modernize the 
 context and content of training and to emphasize teaching and mentoring over assessment in addition training companies continually strive to 
 develop their courses in order to avoid stagnation remain relevant and challenge all candidates to achieve their utmost potential by 
 adopting a results centric vice process centric focus we foster and promote the principles of mission command and manoeuvre warfare 
 at the lowest level developing soldiers and junior leaders prepared to meet the challenges presented in the contemporary operating environment 
 overall 2005 was a highly productive year and the training centre looks forward to the challenges of 2006 lcol mike

 69 the patrician 2005 french grey the year 2005 was yet another demanding period for all patricias in the atlantic 
 area at ctc gagetown in particular officers and ncos had been occupied with training candidates on numerous courses including the 
 army tactical operations course atoc common army phase cap dismounted infantry platoon commander course and the mechanized platoon commander course 
 to name but a few several patricia officers and ncos joined us out here as instructors during the summer the 
 patricias celebrated the colonel in chief s birthday with a game of broom i 100 despite blood and sweat the 
 officers were still unsuccessful in preventing the senior ncos victory in the 2005 regimental day broom i 100 game now 
 this should not be a surprise given that only six officers decided to show up while the senior ncos reinforced 
 with numerous mcpls attending the infantry 3a had about ten lines of spares players captain rutland still appears to be 
 in shock after getting a bloody nose better luck next time members of the french grey battalion attended the alantic 
 area ppcli association 2005 annual general meeting agm in charlottetown which was a great success good food drink and friendship 
 rumour has it that the local legion in charlottetown has made capt mandaher mwo penney and wo snow honorary members 
 the atlantic area ppcli association has selected gagetown as the site for the 2006 agm the french grey battalion will 
 be assisting with the event and currently the plans calls for the 2006 agm in mid september as with every 
 year significant changes have taken place within the patricias lt george williams formerly wo williams infantry school received his commission 
 this year his wealth of experience will no doubt be an aid both to him and his soldiers as he 
 begins the next phase of his career some of former wo williams peers are no doubt questioning his decision making 
 ability due to the fact that not only did he become an officer but is also wishing to improve his 
 drill and join the rcr despite the troubling news we will be sure to remind him that he still owes 
 beer at the officers mess although captain doug clark tactics school has tremendously enjoyed his stay in gagetown he is 
 grudgingly counting down the days until he leaves in 2006 or at least he hopes he would stay longer but 
 he understands that all good things must come to an end down in the infantry school operations and training cell 
 the patricias are now well represented by mcpl renouf and wo thorton additionally major proctor promoted in may 2005 took 
 over as oc a coy the senior company at the infantry school over at the lfaatc cwo bartlett departed to 
 become the force rsm in afghanistan which resulted in mwo penney taking the reigns as the french grey rsm lcol 
 creighton and sgts heseleton mullin and dunn still remain and are training an ever increasing load of soldiers 
 the patrician 2005 70 french grey for follow on training with ctc or returning and newly qualified soldiers and leaders 
 to their fp parent units we also cannot forget sgt tilley who is busy putting his pioneer skills to work 
 as the trg and ops sgt at the lfaa tc det aldershot the patricias in gagetown ended the year on 
 a well deserved festive note the week prior to christmas leave was filled with sports camaraderie and laughs we can 
 rest assured that 2006 will be just as challenging and just as successful as the past one for the patricias 
 in gagetown however it should be noted that the past year also had its share of misfortune with the untimely 
 passing of warrant officer kevin towell wo towell was employed in the urban operations cell at the infantry school he 
 was consistently professional in all that he did wo towell was not only a superb instructor but was an excellent 
 leader soldier and friend to all who knew him he will continue to be missed by all wo kevin towell 
 moving on further to the east in nova scotia sgt chad mcnamara is enjoying halifax and is currently the operational 
 tasker at lfaa hq he returned from op augural in senegal africa in the fall sgt mcnamara did get the 
 opportunity to leave his office at lfaa hq by being employed as the avgp driver course wo other patricias have 
 managed to make their way to the vibrant city of halifax they are employed with the princess louise fusiliers plf 
 reserve unit there are four patricias with the plf who include cpl mansfield cpl carter wo warrington and capt giesbrecht 
 these four individuals have the responsibility of assisting in the training and preparation of the unit for domestic operations and 
 augmentation of personnel to international tasks presently the plf are the lead unit in exercise southbound trooper to virginia which 
 will occur in 2006 furthermore soon the reserve brigades in atlantic canada will be building two platoons to conduct d 
 s tasks for a future deployment to afghanistan the ppcli continues to provide knowledge and guidance as well as administrative 
 support to these efforts unfortunately mwo bud gilfoy decided it was time to move on and decided to retire just 
 after returning from his most recent operational deployment as is evident ppcli soldiers and officers in the atlantic area have 
 been extremely busy both in the training system and at the staff level there are patricias posted to every atlantic 
 province with the exception of pei however pei is well covered by the association and we cannot forget sgt walsh 
 who is now serving with the peir the french grey battalion will certainly continue to contribute knowledge and expertise in 
 all realms and will meet all challenges during the new year see your career manager soon as many more patricias 
 are moving east for aps 06 
 71 the patrician 2005 a patricia in baghdad by lcol d mills hello fellow patricia s i wanted to take 
 this opportunity to provide you a sitrep from baghdad i am currently on exchange with the 3rd us infantry division 
 also known as multi national division baghdad as the deputy g 3 we assumed responsibility for baghdad from the ist 
 cavalry division in january 2004 and will surrender authority to 4th infantry division on 7 january 2006 the real world 
 mission of the 3rd infantry division is to deploy rapidly to a contingency area by air land and sea to 
 conduct mobile combined arms offensive and defensive operations worldwide the 3rd infantry division was formed at the on set of 
 the first world war and has one of the most successful combat records of any u s army division in 
 july 1918 the division earned lasting distinction engaged in the aisne marne offensive as a member of the american expeditionary 
 force to europe the division was protecting paris with a position on the banks of the mame river surrounding units 
 retreated the 3rd infantry division remained rock solid and earned its reputation as the rock of the mame a somewhat 
 more modern moniker that has stuck is mame express given for the division s extremely high operational tempo forty nine 
 members of the 3d infantry division have been awarded the medal of honor while serving the united states of america 
 the most highly decorated soldier of the ww 11 lt audie murphy served with the division s 15th infantry regiment 
 early in 2003 the deployability and fighting capability of the mame division was highly visible worldwide when the entire division 
 deployed in weeks to kuwait it was called on subsequently to spearhead coalition forces in operation iraqi freedom fighting its 
 way to baghdad in early april leading to the end of the saddam hussein government imposed tyranny over the people 
 of iraq the 3d infantry division 3id is now one of 10 active divisions in the us army it is 
 composed of four maneuver brigade combat teams bct one aviation brigade one division support brigade and a special troops battalion 
 a brigade combat team is in many ways comparable to our cmbgs the bcts are a result of the us 
 army s transformation strategy that is the change from division based to brigade based operations in the past a us 
 brigade was only composed of infantry and or armored units there was no integral combat support or combat service support 
 at the brigade leave therefore brigades would have to rely on the habitual relationship with division troops and assets when 
 conducting operations independent operations by brigades less enhanced separated brigades were problematic operation iraqi freedom 111 marks the first combat 
 deployment by 3id as a partially transformed division transformation will not be completed until the division returns from this deployment 
 full transformation should be completed by the division s return to combat in 2007 
 the patrician 2005 72 3id is currently task organized in baghdad with 11 subordinate us brigades totaling j over 40 
 000 soldiers in addition we are responsible for training and commanding and controlling seven iraqi army brigades eight iraqi police 
 brigades and 15 000 police officers in all there are approximately 60 000 iraqi security forces answering to 3id as 
 the deputy g 3 lam responsible to our assistant division commander for maneuver we are on the road everyday be 
 it to a decisive point during a combat operation to train and mentor iraqi security forces engage iraqi ministers generals 
 press activities battlefield circulation or patrolling with a unit for me it is quite a unique involvement and exposure and 
 a tremendous opportunity for professional development i have been able to participate on a number of unparalleled counter insurgency operations 
 it has been an extremely rewarding year we seated a transitional national assembly witnessed the drafting and passing of the 
 iraqi constitution and the first election of a permanent government all this while fighting an active insurgency the rewards unfortunately 
 have not been without loss to date we have lost 273 soldiers on this deployment and have close to 2000 
 wia we try to keep ahead of the insurgents but they are audacious their weapon of choice is the led 
 or vbied we still get ambushed small arms and rpg but the real threat is led vbied we get mortared 
 rockets into the fob about three times a week the division averages approximately 40 attacks per day the us army 
 is great at fielding equipment to counter the latest threat the three challenges to the iraqis for self autonomy are 
 the continued security unrest in baghdad corruption at all levels and a strong likelihood of sectarian violence it is like 
 there is a festering malaise just waiting to erupt it is quite eerie actually the number of inter tribal attacks 
 is fast on the raise the militias unofficially sanctioned by government ministries are getting out of control if we could 
 find a way to harness their capability then it could be a good thing but they all come with their 
 own agenda ministries tribal political religious etc the us soldiers are resilient and doing an outstanding job given all the 
 limitations of battling an active insurgency once the permanent government is in place coalition efforts can really focus on training 
 the iraqi security forces once they are ready to fly solo we will be able to step back into a 
 supporting role hopefully transparent to the iraqi people i wish i could tell you how long this would take but 
 probably at least another 18 24 months re deployment is in the early stages but is clearly upon us turning 
 in equipment loading sea containers pre positioning c 2 nodes between here and home station i will probably be out 
 of here with the last crew sometime toward the end of jan early feb we will have a couple weeks 
 off then we are right back at it it looks like we will have to prep one 
 73 the patrician 2005 brigade to return to baghdad within 10 months after re deployment for another year long tour 
 the remainder of the division will deploy back here summer fall 07 an 18 month turn around we have many 
 tough days ahead between focused counter insurgency operations here while trying to set conditions for reintegration and train up back 
 at home it has been a demanding yet rewarding year i am at the halfway mark of my exchange and 
 looking forward to our change of mission a year is combat is a long time lam anxiously awaiting the challenges 
 the remainder of my exchange will bring a patricia in the sudan by lcol m goodspeed i have an incredibly 
 interesting job that allows considerable travel in this diverse but troubled country i ve already been to some fascinating places 
 and met dozens of truly remarkable people juba the town where i m living is 1 200 kilometres away from 
 but a continent distant from sudan s capital khartoum juba has been aptly described as the largest village in africa 
 as it consists of hundreds of small neighbourhoods made up of tukuls mud huts with straw roofs and there is 
 only one building that s over two stories anything that s not made of mud was built before 1956 and 
 probably hasn t been painted since then the city and its people have suffered terribly during this long and horrendous 
 civil war but the people here in juba are stoically cheerful and get on with re building their lives as 
 best they can people tell me juba has a population of 250 000 you would never know it to look 
 at the town from the ground and a census hasn t been done here for decades no one really knows 
 how many live here but one thing is certain it s growing rapidly there is no place like south sudan 
 for people watching each day i see new groups of people on the streets this morning there were small crowds 
 of tired dusty barefoot herdsmen shuffling into town from the west they were all carrying empty game bags and they 
 had spears and arrows on their shoulders except for a few young men at the back who had ak47s slung 
 on their backs despite wearing brightly coloured bush smocks these newcomers looked grim and determined the locals i spoke to 
 weren t certain where they came from but someone suggested an inaccessible area over by the border with the central 
 african republic each one of them was sporting an unusual set of very deep horizontal tribal scars quite different from 
 the usual tribal markings you see here in addition to the people moving in from the outlying areas every day 
 also brings a new flood of returning refugees people just seem to drift in from darfur the kordofan and the 
 camps outside khartoum the new migration pattern is driven in part by the peace agreement in the south but there 
 is also a major increase in banditry in and around juba and many people are coming here to find safety 
 for the last two nights running the lord s resistance army lra has terrorized outlying settlements the lra is a 
 vicious and absolutely lunatic group from uganda it s made up largely of abducted child soldiers and has existed for 
 nearly twenty years the lra 
 the patrician 2005 74 is fighting to overthrow the ugandan government in order to institute a new social order based 
 upon the ten commandments they have twice raided gumba a small village four 1 kilometres away from here on the 
 east bank of the nile they looted whatever they could find abducted two children and killed several people once they 
 got what they needed to keep themselves going they slipped back into the night some suggest that it s not 
 the lra but a band of unemployed soldiers who have never been paid i d guess that some of the 
 lawlessness farther west can certainly be blamed on that however on the weekend the lra left a pretty convincing letter 
 written in acholi a ugandan language their list of demands is as crazy and scattered as the organization itself we 
 had some heavy tribal fighting in yambio a little over a week ago but the sudanese people s liberation army 
 spla moved their dinka troops out of the town and replaced them with soldiers from the local tribes un observers 
 and bangladeshi infantry are there now and that combination has quietened things down almost as quickly as it took for 
 the trouble to flare up despite having a mixture of many different tribes living here juba itself is reasonably quiet 
 last weekend as planned the spla moved back in strength into town their entrance into town was the most jubilant 
 event i ve ever witnessed two full brigades of former guerrillas in new uniforms and sporting brand new weapons marched 
 and drove by crammed onto civilian trucks the crowds were ecstatic a bull was sacrificed on the main street followed 
 by deliriously happy surging crowds women undulate kids dancing drummers pounding horns blowing flags waving drunks lurching around people cheering 
 themselves hoarse it was really something to witness ye day couldn t have been more of a celebration i ve 
 enclosed a picture of some of the spla in their new uniforms loaded onto a truck outside town like that 
 photo everyday i see so many different scenes that keep hammering home to me the message that michael you are 
 living in one very different corner of the world you would think that with two brigades of spla in a 
 town that has been held by the sudanese army for the entire war it would be an explosive situation but 
 the problems appear to be minor ones there have been some deadly fights but so far it s been criminal 
 activity not organized fighting and things have happily remained under control the sudanese armed forces saf have pretty much stayed 
 in their barracks and un sponsored joint integrated units of spla saf military police have been patrolling and they have 
 managed to keep a lid on things there is absolutely no night life here not much day life to speak 
 of either for that matter and in the last couple weeks with the changes in the town the market area 
 has become seriously dangerous after dark but to put this into context i can say the same thing about numerous 
 other more developed cities i ve spent time in as well life here is fascinating and as much as i 
 miss my beautiful wife and family africa is a rush everyday there is something completely different and intriguing the place 
 actually smells different there is always dust in the air mixed with the ever present tang of burning garbage and 
 burning grass i live in a tent which is fine by me on the whole the conditions are probably at 
 least as comfortable as what the average canadian soldier puts up with in the field in winter it s quite 
 hot here yesterday at noon the thermometer in our camp registered 46 degrees think of the hottest days in ontario 
 in july with high humidity then crank up a few degrees of brilliantly hot sunshine and that s south sudan 
 juba is in a transitional area something between the savanna and the jungle it s more savanna than jungle with 
 a healthy sprinkling of mango trees and grasslands the climate supports more insects than you would believe possible and as 
 a result at night we have hundreds of harmless toads in the camp the downside of toads is that they 
 attract snakes and although they are very rarely a problem we had an egyptian cobra three nights ago slithering into 
 in the tent next to mine as a result i m very careful when i reach for my shower thongs 
 in the morning and i keep my tent flap tightly zipped the food s tolerable it s healthy but monotonous 
 we get two choices of rice and chicken rice and curried beef or rice and lamb a k a goat 
 for both lunch and dinner every single day all the other nationals in our camp think tabasco sauce is a 
 canadian dietary staple i m not complaining when you see what the poor locals are eating these things keep the 
 un s relatively comfortable lives in sharp perspective 
 the patrician 2005 75 there are no identified direct threats to the un here in sudan so in real terms 
 we re aan pretty safe in fact the spla and the sudanese government army actually work alongside us nonetheless there 
 s no question the peace here is a fragile one the place is swimming in weapons and there are still 
 about sixty other armed groups private militias tribes warlords and gangs who have not signed up to the peace agreement 
 we are trying to get them all signed up and aligned with either the saf or the spla early in 
 the new year but we ll have to wait and see how that plays out the other armed groups could 
 be a problem because if any one of them gets out of hand they could possibly send the place up 
 in flames again also after so many years of such a brutal war neither side trusts the other and it 
 wouldn t take much to get the most antagonistic elements back to fighting each other again nonetheless we do see 
 gains made and we can all see progress on a daily basis the un presence here and the policy in 
 this particular mission of doing everything jointly the un the sudanese armed forces and the sudanese people s liberation army 
 doing monitoring and verification tasks together is working quite well and will probably become a new standard procedure for peacekeeping 
 missions my job is totally absorbing and i m grateful that i managed to get such a good one i 
 work with twelve other officers in the joint monitoring coordination office jmco which does the groundwork for the development and 
 coordination of overall ceasefire policy as well as hammers out with the spla and saf all those military issues that 
 can t be resolved regionally the jmco was wisely positioned well forward in the heart of the most southerly state 
 as a result we are right beside the most pressing issues as they happen it means that we are well 
 informed and we can react fairly quickly the distance from the force headquarters in khartoum is not a great problem 
 cynics say it s an advantage although the military components of the headquarters that i deal with are quite reasonable 
 and doing their best we couldn t have operated like this a few years ago now we are connected right 
 across the country by satellite links with mobile phones radios and the internet unfortunately the saf and the spla do 
 not have the kinds of communication capabilities we have and it makes quite a difference in their ability to react 
 and to pass on information to their more remotely deployed troops this is particularly true of the spla who are 
 quite literally moving from being a hardscrabble guerrilla movement to a modern army and although they are trying their hardest 
 the problems they face are enormous one of the characteristics of the mission in sudan is that from an operational 
 viewpoint it s extremely complex both sides are highly factionalized and there are numerous competing interests that influence what s 
 going on here tribalism oil religion ethnicity language established power groups such as the police and intelligence services private militias 
 as well as the influence of border states and other neighbouring insurgencies all combine to make the simplest things complex 
 there are also numerous factors within the un mission itself that complicate the situation there are over seventy five nations 
 deployed here from every corner 
 the patrician 2005 76 of the earth each with different cultures different perceptions of time different ideas on hygiene different 
 views on how urgent things should be different thinking on hierarchy authority and dignity different ideas as to what constitutes 
 good manners and not the least radically different abilities in english the common mission language it all adds up to 
 make for some interesting moments the jmco the group i work in is responsible for keeping three levels of inter 
 factional meetings going and so we work seven days a week we convene a meeting each morning with both saf 
 and spla officers it s a busy pace and we spend about twelve to thirteen hours each day working on 
 a comprehensive range of issues such as monitoring troop movements troop withdrawals de mining operations disarming militias demobilization of ex 
 soldiers the formation of a new joint and integrated army as well as more narrowly focussed things such as child 
 soldiers deserters disarming the nomads helping non government organizations and un agencies set up programs for disabled ex combatants and 
 setting up joint spla and govt of sudan monitoring teams the work is totally absorbing and the days seem to 
 connect into a long fast forward blur there s lots to do and as i said it allows for plenty 
 of travel and daily interaction with both sides i love it it s certainly the most interesting and rewarding professional 
 work i ve ever done from the internet i see that very little of what goes on down here ever 
 makes it into the press because there are no foreign reporters anywhere for hundreds and hundreds of kilometres it s 
 kind of like a tree falling in the forest and no one being there to hear it if the peace 
 holds and the un and a lot of sudanese are working as hard as they can to ensure that it 
 does then there is no doubt that things will eventually get a lot better there are some signs of improvement 
 now i see more little road side stands popping up here and there people sitting on the verge of dirt 
 roads selling a few bottles of soft drinks soap and other simple luxuries there is also a small bus service 
 operating now that wasn t around a few weeks ago small things but they add up in the aggregate there 
 are plans for much larger international aid projects to start coming on stream in the next several months and things 
 like a working electrical grid a clean water supply and sewage lines will make a vast difference in people s 
 lives down here i m sincerely looking forward to the day when the armies have stood back from one another 
 when the roads are open the mines are gone and the bandits and crazy leftovers are all cleared then the 
 economy can start up again and people can begin to resume something close to normal lives there s really not 
 much else to report my days are full and things are going about as well as we could have hoped 
 for out here out in the land of sticky sweltering eternal blistering sunshine if one has to be far from 
 home i can t honestly think of a better reason for it than doing what we re doing and i 
 don t regret it for a second did you know the author of the lassie series was a patricia eric

 this error by calling out the many trades present on parade and having them put their hands up once every

 from 1 pi e coy proved victorious despite overwhelming odds and earned themselves three extra days off compliments of the 
 commanding officer with the mil skills complete and 265 tow missiles to fire we began our range week with a 
 basic static range firing twenty year old missiles from thirty year old mll3 tua s turned out to be a 
 recipe for misfires and missile malfunctions e coy troops proved their mettle and performed the many many misfire drills without 
 mishap pte gareth hayter spent two full minutes contemplating the meaning of life while carrying an extremely hot misfired tow 
 missile to the dud pit the next day brought the intermediate range and with it an excellent opportunity to fire 
 a couple missiles jockey and fire some more missiles exercising the entire vehicle crew the intermediate range culminated with five 
 mll3 tua s volley firing at one hard tank target this turned out to be the luckiest tank in the 
 world one missile struck the ground one hundred meters shy one hit 50 meters beyond two got tangled and flew 
 off into the wild blue yonder and one decided it wanted to join the american flag on the moon completing 
 this portion of the range with maximum speed and aggression prepared us for the advanced shoot to come the advanced 
 range consisted 
 81 the patrician 2005 of fighting a delaying action while destroying the enemy in subsequent fallback positions the advanced range 
 ran quite smoothly with only a few misfires and anything that remotely resembled a target destroyed cpl sonny chauhan was 
 able to observe a target that had yet to pop up through his 13x optical sight his crew commander sgt 
 joel pipes turnbull decided to make a preemptive strike and destroy the target on the order to fire cpl chauhan 
 guided the missile to the barely visible target over two kilometers away once again demonstrating the pinpoint accuracy of the

 marc leger corporal ainsworth dyer and private richard green nathan smith was a fine canadian soldier he put his life 
 on the line in afghanistan for the afghan people just as hundreds of young canadian women and men are coming 
 here to do today said minister of national defence bill graham we should never forget those who paid the ultimate 
 price to serve our country said colonel steve bowes the prt commanding officer nathan is an example and an inspiration 
 to all the young soldiers of this prt and those who will come after them to continue canada s commitment

 of 3rd battalion of the princess patricia canadian light infantry 3 ppcli died accidentally during a parachuting exercise in trenton 
 on october 3rd 2005 the announcement of wo sheppard s death was a cold shiver for many prt members in 
 kandahar as the patrol company is mostly composed of members from the same battalion many prt members jumped with wo 
 sheppard shared the same trench or were taught parachuting drills by this long time airborne soldier this memorial was an 
 emotional moment for many members of the prt particularly for sergeant chuck cote who read wo sheppard s impressive biography 
 and paid a last tribute to his long time colleague and good friend charlie was a tough and competitive man 
 with a big heart besides being a dedicated soldier we should remember him as a loving father as an entrepreneur 
 who had always something on the side but overall as someone you could count on at any time to help 
 you and your family he was always there to help he was an infantry man a jumper a pathfinder a 
 ranger who always had a smile on his face even in the hardest moments i saw this man drive his 
 body to the ground there is no doubt in my mind charlie would have been a regimental sergeant major he 
 owned all the qualities to be an outstanding rsm shared chief warrant officer ward brown the prt rsm who served 
 with wo sheppard at 1 ppcli and with the commando if charlie would be with us today he would not 
 like to see sadness he was a soldier s soldier who enjoyed every minute of his life and liked to

 as most of the readers of this journal know and there were many events that celebrated the contribution of veterans 
 across canada not all of these gatherings this year were a happy celebration as the regiment mourned the passing of 
 several notable canadian heroes on august 3rd our entire nation mourned the passing of sergeant smokey smith vc smoky was 
 a seaforth highlander of canada who fought beside the patricia s in world war 11 italy and as the last 
 surviving canadian victoria cross winner his passing became a national event operation valour as the ceremony was named required the 
 surge effort of not only the seaforth highlanders but also most of the available troops and staff from 39 canadian 
 brigade group it was the honour of many serving bc patricias to participate in or help organize the massive undertakings 
 of a lying in state in the seaforth armouries a vigil funeral and grand wake smokey s wishes were to 
 buy his regiment a drink on his passing participating also in the procession was a full company of patricia soldiers 
 from 1 cmbg smokey would have been proud of his regiment and the entire army of the far west s 
 turn out on a perfect sunny day for his funeral and wake even urbanite vancouver turned out in the thousands 
 to pay respects to this local hero and the last of the canadian vc winners near the end of the 
 year the regiment was still saddened by the news of the passing of lord john brabourne when news of colonel 
 big jim stone falling gravely ill was distributed colonel stone who has lived on vancouver island for many years and 
 had served in the past as the commanding officer of the rocky mountain rangers loyal edmonton regiment and 2 ppcli

 november and his life was celebrated in a small and dignified funeral in victoria attended by family dignitaries patricias and 
 veterans as the training year comes hurtling once again towards exercise cougar salvo for 39 canadian brigade group in march 
 2006 the contributions of patricias to this brigade become more evident patricia staff posted to brigade headquarters and the units 
 are bringing a new wealth of operational experience to the reserves refreshing and updating tactics techniques and procedures for the 
 contempory operating environment task force 2 07 looms in the future next year as this brigade prepares to make use 
 of that experience and train a reserve mission element for possible deployment patricia regular support staff are integrated in every 
 infantry unit in 39 brigade and are ready to lead the way in 2007 for transformation to jtf pacific kingston 
 area patricias as is tradition the kingston chapter was able to officially meet three times this past year i say 
 officially because more often then naught every friday night a table at the fort frontenac officers mess seems to be 
 occupied by our regiment 2005 was a transition year for the patricias in kingston in light of cf transformation and 
 the creation of cefcom the patricia bastion known as the cfjog was purged and resulted in a decrease of patricia 
 pys in kingston notably col pat stogran was seconded to the pearson peacekeeping centre and lcol shaun tymchuk deployed to 
 iraq nonetheless kingston remains a favourite for patricias young and old one only needs to look at the list of 
 inter actors at the simulation centre or have witnessed maj retd lou grimshaw s run for a federal seat in 
 the last provincial election to realize that the patricia culture is alive in the thousands islands region as always we

 difficult task despite this everyone seems to pass through ottawa at least once and there are always chance meetings with 
 old comrades the first major regimental event of the year was a dinner organized by the association to mark the 
 17th of march a handful of regular members of the regiment joined the association for a pleasant dinner at the 
 connaught ranges mess as always the event was a chance to renew friendships and make new ones following the turmoil 
 of posting season local patricias gathered at the elephant and castle to meet the cos and rsms who were in 
 town for the november merit boards as always the event was well attended and we were fortunate enough to be 
 visited by gen stewart the event was followed a few days later by the association s annual remembrance day service 
 at lansdowne park the site of the regiment s first parade in 1914 one other noteworthy event also sponsored by 
 the association was a visit by major mark campbell dco of the 3rd battalion who was in town for a

 the patrician 2005 86 ppcli reflections in australia captain lionel boxer cd lcm phd when i learned that my old 
 royal military college of canada rmc flat mate now colonel david barr had achieved such great heights as the staff 
 of the cds i felt obliged to congratulate him on his progress it was to obtain his email address that 
 i emailed the regimental adjutant of the patricia s and this article is a result of my inquiry david of 
 course is the son of another great colonel barr who i recall served with another great infantry regiment i übiquitously 0:ubiquitously 
 come from a sapper tradition my late father was royal engineers bth army and a rr scorer corr frc ccftf 
 form 
 the patrician 2005 87 later royal canadian engineers and my great great uncle commanded forestry operations m at windsor castle 
 during ww i and i have so far served as a royal canadian engineer and the royal australian engineer rae 
 however two connections with the infantry are that my forestry great great uncle raised the soo rifles in sault st 
 marie in 1914 and i have served in an infantry battalion since 2000 as kipling explained sappers are all men 
 under one jacket and of course the secondary duty of sappers is to fight as infantry at rmc i took 
 pleasure assaulting the ears of colonel barr and others with my attempts as a piper i gave that pursuit up 
 for 18 years but in 1998 was pressed into service as an associate piper by the then pipe major of 
 sth 6th battalion the royal victoria regiment with endless coaching and abuse of three pipe majors i have evolved into 
 a reliable piper the australian army preferred that i did not volunteer and i was appointed captain in the australian 
 army reserve in time to perform at the 2000 edinburgh military tattoo since then i have worked in an infantry 
 battalion as a recruiter administration company commander of which ps ds forms a platoon and now as pipes and drums

 of merit of course the legion is closely associated with the patricia s since ww i when many legion members

 not enough time my connection with the patricia s began during sapper officer training in chilliwack where i met officers 
 and warrant officers of the ppcli having been raised in toronto i thought the only regular army infanteers were based 
 out of london ontario later i was pleased to learn that colonel sid frost lives a block away from my 
 parents i had seen sid over the years but never knew him until many years later sid is also a 
 past commanding officer distinguished patricia and past honorary colonel of the royal regiment of canada which is an affiliate of 
 the royal victoria regiment i have had the pleasure of visiting their mess many times during 
 the patrician 2005 88 my career but the last time i was there i gave the toast to the royal 
 victoria regiment as f an regimental affiliate one of the high points of my visits to toronto these days is

 given a silva compass with degrees as opposed to mils it was all quite entertaining i recall hearing him over 
 the radio you are not at that grid reference because i am at that grid reference hey who switched my 
 compass the delay provided us a well deserved break as we waited for him to find his way back to

 find myself in a position to be affiliated with such a fine regiment every april the regular army royal australian

 government the time spent with both medical colleagues and veterans was amazing and all patricias might know that the regiment 
 is held in the highest regards to this day former patricias might desire to travel to korea to experience the 
 respect and thanks of all for the service of their regiment 
 the patrician 2005 90 for the father and son team of ex patricias it was an experience not ever to

 the patrician 2005 91 the royal green jackets 2005 the ist battalion continued to be based at weeton the new 
 year saw them resubordinated from 52 inf bde to 19 light bde and they began training for spearhead in otterburn 
 and scotland this continued through february and early march including cast at catterick and optag at lydd they assumed spearhead 
 earlier than planned on 5 march and deployed immediately to kosovo to assist in maintaining public order during the arrest 
 of ramush haradinaj for alleged war crimes in 1999 in kosovo they conducted a number of multinational operations with the 
 nordic us and french brigades over the course of a 3week 0:3 0:week deployment on return to uk they conducted 
 a jncos cadre during the remainder of spearhead after summer leave in august they were warned to be part of 
 the nato reaction force 6 nrf 6 from 1 january 30 june 2006 also in 2006 they go to belize 
 and are planned to deploy to afghanistan later in the year 2rgj began the year in ballykinler northern ireland but 
 returned at the end of the summer and are now well established in kiwi barracks bulford camp and very busy 
 training for their new mechanised role in ireland they were kept busy particularly with the onset of the marching season 
 but also made full use of the facilities and opportunities for sport and were nl champions in a number of 
 sports including swimming rugby athletics and boxing their shooting team had done well coming 4th in nisaam a rgj memorial 
 window was installed in the church at ballykinler which commemorated all those green jackets who had died in northern ireland 
 they are currently undergoing a period of intensive training connected with their conversion to the mechanised role as well as 
 renewing their support weapons skills and some intensive driver training they are relishing the challenge of being in a deployable 
 brigade again in early 2006 there will be the tartan trophy competition on dartmoor bowman conversion and other specialised collective 
 training in april they intend to return to competitive boxing and will be holding their novice championships rgj badged members 
 of the ta also had a busy year with a considerable number from both the london regiment and the royal 
 rifle volunteers being deployed operationally to iraq towards the end of the year the future of the regiment became the 
 object of some serious high level discussion the army board has directed the infantry to consider forming larger regiments in 
 order to better meet operational demands and efficiency arms plotting is due to give way to an individual posting policy 
 which would mean units would remain relatively static but individuals would find themselves posted from battalion to battalion to ensure 
 an element of career balance and variety after careful wide ranging cooperative and generous discussion it was decided the best 
 option was to join with the light infantry the devonshire and dorset light infantry and the royal gloucestershire berkshire and 
 wiltshire light infantry to form a wholly new regiment to be known as the rifles the inspiration for the new 
 regiment will be the light division and the values of independent thought action and leadership propounded by sir john moore 
 self discipline fortitude and steadiness of heart this new regiment will have 5 regular and two ta battalions it will 
 enshrine much of rifle and light infantry regimental traditions uniform will be predominantly rifle green the cap badge will be 
 the light infantry bugle with the rgbwli back badge probably being be worn on the no 1 dress hat the 
 regiment will not have colours battle honours will be celebrated by a maltese cross inscribed with representational battle honours in 
 each quarter to be worn on the cross belt or waist belt as appropriate much remains to be done and 
 discussion is on going but the foundation is already being laid for a new regiment which can build proudly on 
 a solid basis of the traditions and history of their forbears

 jim by his men with the greatest respect was born on february 8 1908 he was a soldier of a 
 grand style seldom seen anywhere in any nation according to veterans who served with him jim stone joined the canadian 
 army as a recruit private in 1939 at the advanced age of 31 very old for a soldier in those 
 days he enlisted as a recruit in the edmonton regiment later to be renamed the loyal edmonton regiment and popularly 
 known as the loyal eddies he had a certain knack for soldiering was strong and strong willed application of these 
 natural qualities and much hard work and dedication saw him climb through every non commissioned rank in the canadian army 
 and become the loyal eddie s regimental sergeant major jim stone was stuck in england with his regiment until 1943 
 but then the loyal eddies drew what they all thought was a lucky straw they were selected as one of 
 the canadian infantry battalions to serve in the sicily invasion in july 1943 tens of thousands of other canadians languished 
 in england for another year until the normandy landings in june 1944 it was not long until some of jim 
 s comrades wished they were back in blighty too sicily was followed by the campaign in italy there the loyal 
 edmonton regiment together with the seaforth highlanders of canada were soon in furious battle with units from germany s ist 
 parachute regiment at the resort town of ortona in december the fighting was terrible close in house to house by 
 then jim stone had received a commission and rapidly had been promoted to major and company commander at one point 
 in the battle of ortona major stone was advancing with a small formation and they were stopped cold by a 
 german anti tank gun emplacement jim stone threw a smoke grenade rushed forward dropped a fragmentation grenade over the armour 
 shield of the enemy cannon and silenced it for that singular feat of bravery he was awarded the military cross 
 the battle of ortona began on december 22 and continued over christmas day it did not end until december 27 
 1943 when the enemy withdrew the loyal eddies lost 63 men killed in action and the seaforths had 41 men 
 killed in action the loyal eddies went on to fight in germany too and by war s end jim stone 
 was a lieutenant colonel commanding the regiment he brought it home to edmonton in addition to the military cross he 
 had been awarded two distinguished service orders colonel stone was the commanding officer of the rocky mountain rangers a militia 
 unit when he lived in salmon arm bc following the war he also was engaged in a business there but 
 in july 1950 he was summoned back into service to command the 2nd battalion princess patricia s canadian light infantry 
 he was a tough commander and he made his unit tough too he screened out those he deemed not fit 
 for battle and put the others through rigorous training not only in canada but in korea too when his patricias 
 landed at pusan in december 1950 the us army gave colonel stone orders that instructed him to travel north of 
 seoul and place his battalion under the command of the 29th british independent infantry brigade which was on the front 
 line guarding the imjin river big jim stone refused for the very best of reasons his battalion was only four 
 months old and many of the men had barely completed eight weeks of personal training they had virtually no large 
 unit training and were not ready to enter action as a cohesive battalion he borrowed a light plane and flew 
 to suwon and confronted lieutenant general walton walker who commanded all united nations troops 
 the patrician 2005 93 in korea stone refused to commit his troops until they had six more weeks of training 
 at the company and battalion level the tough american general gave in stone took his men to miryang just north 
 of pusan and trained them very hard as all of those surviving today will attest they were attacking hills in 
 korea by mid february 1951 after the ppcli had participated in its first engagements on hills 444 419 and 352 
 colonel stone contracted smallpox and was hospitalized for several weeks he returned to the battalion literally within hours of the 
 enemy breaking through the line in a ferocious all out broad scale assault in late april his battalion along with 
 the 3rd battalion of the royal australian regiment was ordered to take up blocking positions in the kapyong river valley 
 and hold the enemy back the patricia s held a vast area on four mountains on the west side of 
 the valley while the australians held similar positions to the east on the night of april 23 24 the patricia 
 s came under attack as jim stone attested later with units buckling all around them the patricia s did not 
 give up an inch of ground they stood fast and with masterful use of artillery machinegun and mortar support they 
 held off five to ten times their own numbers because of their skilled use of ground their own casualties were 
 kept to a minimum for several hours on the next day they were completely surrounded but the enemy effort had 
 been blunted the last major thrust of the chinese forces had been turned back in their sector the enemy would 
 never again attempt a broad scale assault and soon after entered into ceasefire negotiations although they were to drag on 
 for two full years a day after the april 23 24 battle of kapyong lcol stone was advised that his 
 two year old daughter moira had undergone surgery for cancer and had lost an eye and was close to death 
 the general commanding the 24th us army division loaned stone his light plane and shuttled him to kimpo field he 
 caught a flight to tokyo where a canadian pacific airlines plane purposefully had gone off schedule waiting for him to 
 arrive he returned to action in korea after spending a mandatory compassionate leave in canada during colonel stone s absence 
 from the front the battalion was commanded by major pat tighe of vancouver the second in command for the action 
 at kapyong and his commendable service in korea lieutenant colonel jim stone was awarded his third distinguished service order a 
 remarkable achievement and the unit was awarded the us presidential citation for their action at kapyong after korea jim stone 
 was promoted to full colonel and appointed provost marshal of the canadian army while serving in that position he founded 
 the military police fund for blind children in 1957 it has since contributed tens of millions of dollars in support 
 to blind children through the years providing for medical needs equipment training guide dogs and recreational activities the fund helps 
 support eight schools for blind children in 1995 colonel stone was appointed by the governor general of canada to the 
 order of canada his citation read a true humanitarian and one of canada s few remaining highly decorated soldiers from 
 world war two and the korean conflict he founded the military police fund for blind children in 1957 bringing 
 he patrician 2005 94 happiness to these very special youngsters under his guidance and life long patronage a i the 
 canada wide fund expanded its activities over the years to europe and the middle east h providing medical equipment as 
 well as educational and recreational assistance otherwise unavailable to the children colonel jim stone was 93 in 2001 when the 
 50th anniversary of the battle of kapyong was commemorated in korea he could not be present because of health reasons 
 however one veteran telephoned him from korea a day in advance and asked if he would accept a telephone call 
 during the ceremonies the next day the ceremonies were to take place in the canadian memorial gardens at the site 
 of the battle of kapyong the canadian monument that commemorates all canadians who served in korea is located there as 
 is a monument to the ppcli jim stone answered the telephone call with booming voice stone here after he considered 
 things he said to go ahead and call the next day he would be waiting there were 50 serving soldiers 
 from the regiment present at kapyong who had just returned from service in bosnia there were also about 20 kapyong 
 veterans present who had served with jim stone during the battle one of them was major gordon henderson of surrey 
 bc who had been his battle adjutant at kapyong another was lieutenant colonel john bishop of victoria who had been 
 a corporal at kapyong but who had risen in rank after the war and at one point in his career 
 served as canada s defence attache to korea others present included private bernie cote of windsor ontario who served in 
 d company on hill 677 at kapyong corporal smiley j douglas of calgary who lost a hand at kapyong and 
 was awarded a military medal for bravery in the field corporal don hibbs of elliot lake ontario and many other 
 outstanding gentlemen j when they dialed jim stone in canada the canadian defence attache s assistant tried to stop the 
 call from being made because there was a ceremony taking place he was told that the veterans were calling the 
 man who had made the ceremony possible jim stone spoke cordially and enthusiastically with every one of the kapyong veterans 
 he recited along with one of them the ppcli verse composed by men from his battalion that boasted of their 
 exploits towards the j end of the call he was weeping he told gordon henderson i wish that i had 
 come over now when he switched off the hand phone henderson said you know i think we have added five 
 years to jim s life in 2003 when the monument to canadian fallen was dedicated in ottawa colonel stone accepted 
 the position of parade grand marshal although he had to watch the two hour ceremony on television from his quarters 
 in victoria major general herb pitts of victoria who was a platoon commander with ist and 3rd ppcli in korea 
 and is a member of the board of the lodge at broadmead handled arrangements with stone pitts was awarded a 
 military cross for his service in korea when he asked jim stone if he would accept the appointment of parade 
 grand marshal stone gallantly said it would be an honour no sir it is us who will be honoured pitts 
 told him with greatest sincerity general pitts marched in the veterans parade in ottawa intermingled with more than 100 other 
 ppcli veterans in honour of colonel stone sergeant roy rushton 85 from tanner hill near pictou nova scotia carried the 
 stone s commanding officer pennant a khaki triangle with the red 2 ppcli emblazoned on it rushton a twice wounded 
 world war ii veteran of the first canadian parachute battalion who had fought in normandy had served with jim stone 
 s battalion in korea and twice led platoons in attacks when their officers were wounded or injured roy rushton led 
 the parade of 1 000 korean war veterans as big jim stone s surrogate and took the salute from then 
 prime minister jean chretien rushton marched boldly swiftly and with great pride on learning of colonel stone s death rushton 
 sent the following message to general pitts hoping it would be passed on to the stone family with a lump 
 in my throat and moist eyes i have just heard the sad news of colonel big jim stone s passing 
 it is impossible to explain the feeling of pride and emotion i felt as i carried his pennant past the 
 saluting base and the large crowd gathered in ottawa that day jim stone was not much on medals and was 
 quite stringent in approving bravery awards for his men he himself despite his bias against them was awarded quite a 
 few he held the order of canada three distinguished service orders the military cross the italy star france germany star 
 the korean war medal and various other service medals from world war two and the korean war 
 95 the patrician 2005 recruiting drive winter for most is nine months of hibernation for others it is three months 
 of recreation for captain mark kwong and master corporal mike rude of canadian forces recruiting detachment edmonton it is an 
 opportunity to rethink the vehicles used during a recruiting drive running from 26 feb to 13 mar 05 and bolstered 
 by the loyal edmonton regiment s sergeant steven boon corporal greg brewster and corporal anthony kenny exercise northern diversification was 
 to see the four soldiers and one pilot travel 2100 km s from fort mcmurray alberta to yellowknife nwt and 
 back to high level alberta by snow mobile but while the five were willing the equipment was weak first stop 
 was fort chipewyan alberta normally accessible only by winter road the patrol eschewed the groomed trail and traversed the athabasca 
 river leaving the road party to travel the tricky ice road although exhilarating the first several hours of the trip 
 were mostly uneventful not until the river intercepted the ice road did the adventure begin after stopping briefly for fuel 
 and food the patrol met with a local from fort chip who offered directions to the town along the river 
 and even offered to guide the four sleds in if they wanted to wait for a bit sgt boon and 
 mcpl rude had been to fort chip the year before on a similar patrol and were confident they knew the 
 route however the athabasca has an unexpectedly large delta and the trip the year prior stuck to the winter road 
 and this year the unusually high amounts of snowfall caused considerable amounts of overflow to pool a foot or more 
 deep beneath the several feet of snow causing the smaller sleds to get stuck in the slush having spent a 
 few extra hours extracting the stuck sleds the patrol finally made it into fort chip a little later and a 
 little wetter than expected despite the unintentionally lengthy approach the stay in fort chip seemed all too short established in 
 1778 by the hudson s bay company it is alberta s oldest settlement several of the residents remembered mcpl rude 
 from his previous visit and during the visit to the high school he remembered the young student who had pulled 
 the cord on the reserve parachute he had brought in for show but not demonstration after the weapons display everyone 
 hurried 
 the patrician 2005 96 over to the community centre to watch lisa odjig 2004 world champion hoop dancer because travel 
 from fort chipewyan to fort smith would be almost entirely through wood buffalo national park the second leg of the 
 patrol was required to use the ice road what w was feared to be a long and boring ride almost 
 proved to be eventful as the patrol was stopped by a park ranger who informed them that a large herd 
 of buffalowes unlawfully gathering along the road however this proved to be the first in a long string of tales 
 about the mythical wood buffalo throughout the exercise the patrol were told of bison and their proclivity to milling with 
 impunity on roadways the only signs seen of the fabled beasts were road signs mayor peter martselos was delighted to 
 have the patrol stop in his town and treated the five to lunch and several souvenirs the recruiters began their 
 display at aurora college where students were surprised to learn of the cultural training military members receive then at the 
 local sports complex and accompanied by the local ranger detachment the patrol set up its weapons display where they were 
 visited by several delighted army cadets afterwards on invite from the locals the patrol went to the legion when the 
 locals learned the route plan for the next leg involved travel up the slave river they were surprised like the 
 athabasca the slave had been beset with considerable snowfall and the overflow was particularly bad besides they said none of 
 the locals had ever made the trip along the river not even the local canadian ranger detachment however sgt boon 
 a very experienced snowmobile operator knew the limitations of the machines and was confident they would overcome the obstacle mcpl 
 rude the consummate recruiter encouraged the locals to come along though the offer was tempting none came from fort smith 
 the patrol was to visit fort resolution for a brief weapons display then immediately on to hay river on the 
 way however catastrophe struck sgt boone s machine a summit 670 had a piston seize although the patrol had gone 
 more half the rumoured impossible to traverse distance like a juggernaut they were required to turn around and spend the 
 evening in fort smith instead of hay river the next day using a borrowed komatik the patrol intended to retrieve 
 the broken sled and continue on to hay river after hours of exhausting work they returned again to sleep in 
 the rcmp s caddy shack fort smith s slogan easy to get to hard to leave proved prophetic indeed two 
 days behind and at 75 vehicular strength the patrol was forced to skip fort resolution and head directly to hay 
 river after leaving wood buffalo the remaining sleds were dismounted from the trailer and continued along the ditch spirits dampened 
 from the previous day s efforts the ride would have been completely uneventful had captain kwong not demonstrated his snowmobile 
 s inferiority to his hercules when it took him several kilometres down the wrong trail fortunately his co pilot on 
 another machine was able to redirect the snowcraft and allow the passengers to return in a full upright position with 
 no schools open to house the weapons displays the patrol opted for what seemed an obvious venue snowmobile races this 
 proved a futile concept as spectators were far more interested in the races than the weapons even cpl brewster who 
 has helped set up and run several races in edmonton was disinterested in the display after relocating to the dene 
 reserve community hall the display was much more successful people were much more receptive to the display as they came 
 in to warm up and the patrol was inundated with interested people after leaving the broken sled for repair in 
 hay river the patrol headed towards fort providence again following roads along the ditches the leg proved to be more 
 entertaining than its predecessor here troops were treated by an eye opening feat of engineering and nature the providence ice 
 bridge almost two kilometres wide crossing ice three metres thick on the mackenzie river the ice bridge was more than 
 a little unsettling worse upon arriving in fort providence the patrol was treated to photos of a tractor trailer and 
 grater falling through the ice a few years before the weapons display set up in the local arena attracted a 
 steady flow of interested residents the twin towns of rae and edzo were the next two on the tour not 
 long after leaving fort providence though the second sled died the truck was becoming increasingly full 
 the patrician 2005 97 shortly before the patrol arrived several residents had left the towns for a caribou hunt and 
 were expected to return with around fifty had the patrol been a few hours earlier they would have had the 
 opportunity to participate as the hunt was done on snowmobile the patrols presence would have been very welcome instead they 
 had to settle for dried caribou and some caribou stew cooked up for them by the local rcmp mcpl rude 
 and capt kwong s skills as recruiters took the back seat as a very energetic and enthusiastic local encouraged people 
 to come in for a hands on display of army weapons he also handed out recruiting literature and ensured that 
 the teens present took the opportunity to speak to the recruiters about careers in the military the only time the 
 two were required to speak was when directly asked by an interested person and often their answers were preempted 0:pre 
 0:empted by the impromptu recruiter before making the last city in the nwt yellowknife the third sled died but the 
 patrol continued at 25 once in the city the patrol was given a tour which included a stop at the 
 snow king s palace an ice palace made entirely by hand tools and from ice from great slave lake after 
 an evening spent shopping for souvenirs and recuperating the patrol took the time to re supply on some much needed 
 timmy s properly retailed rested and refuelled the patrol set its display up at the very busy yellowknife arena yellowknife 
 is the nwt s capital and largest city and its arena is appropriately busy the display was flooded with children 
 and parents going into then coming out hockey games gymnastics and judo the children were delighted when their parents granted 
 them permission to get close to the weapons the parents weren t as delighted when they were encouraged to pick 
 up the shraaw m the day the patrol left yellowknife was the exercise s coldest day a shocker at 28 
 unimpressive to local residents the patrol members were unhappy to hear of the 12 temperatures edmonton was receiving despite having 
 undergone an hour s maintenance the final sled died 11 minutes outside of the city though it is suspected that 
 cpl brewster lied about its loss of power just to escape the cold the patrol that should have been 2100 
 km s by snowmobile had halted at 1427 and as the patrol headed south back into alberta the temperatures increased 
 and trail conditions improved with no sleds to use them on the day also proved to be the exercise s 
 warmest temperatures in high level were just above zero though high level was to be the last stop the weapons 
 display was prepared as though this had been the first owing to a miscommunication in the legion booking however the 
 only people to attend were a few cadets and a local reporter the cadets were very happy to utilize the 
 weapons and were more than willing to have their pictures taken for the newspaper despite not having gone the intended 
 distance by snowmobile the members of the patrol were gladdened to have had the opportunity to go on it it 
 was an opportunity for them to see remote parts of canada they may otherwise not have seen and spread goodwill 
 to all the communities they visited with mcpl rude and capt kwong leaving the recruiting centre the patrol s future 
 is in question but all its members are eager to participate in any future patrols

 he patrician 2005 101 association message from the president r raidt much has happened since i wrote my article for 
 the 2004 patrician there has been trouble in nearly every corner of the globe and patricias continue to serve the 
 noble cause to preserve the peace our thoughts are with those patricias whose call of duty places them in some 
 of the trouble spots we are confident that our soldiers have the benefit of wise and courageous leadership as they 
 embark on various nato un missions many have questioned the purpose of the association in my opinion the association possesses 
 a clear sense of purpose the purpose remains true to the founder s ideals as first expressed in 1947 the 
 purpose and objects of the association as enunciated by the founder are embedded in the association s constitution the preamble 
 to article 111 states in part the objects of the association are to foster and maintain the spirit of the 
 regiment circulate information regarding the regiment amongst its members perpetuate the close bonds of comradeship mutual regard and esprit de 
 corps amongst all ranks formed whilst serving in the regiment the statement is as valid today as it was in 
 the past part of my message this year again is to challenge patricias about to retire or who are still 
 serving to join the association and thus strengthen the regimental family a family however is more than the sum of 
 its parts a family is a cohesive unit inwardly connected to each of its members and ready to challenge any 
 and all external forces to accomplish this we need a broadly based well informed highly motivated membership in which all 
 members enjoy equality of status and have an equal opportunity to plan and participate in the association s if not 
 in the regiment s affairs our focus therefore remains on our active membership and its participation in regimental activities the 
 association is committed to and will continue to be an important member of the regimental family some steps have been 
 taken but much more needs to be done in this respect there has been some changes in our governance structure 
 the regimental museum is no longer under the aegis of the hamilton gault memorial fund but is now part of 
 the regimental fund the association will for the foreseeable future in any case continue to dedicate at least 80 percent 
 of casino proceeds to the museum as we have done so for the last 20 years anniversaries are very worth 
 while they are more than celebrations they are recapitulations of the past the calgary branch as the hosting branch is 
 well advanced with the association s 60th anniversary planning details are provided in this edition of the patrician all are 
 invited to attend this celebration in 2007 overall 2005 has been a very successful year my personal thanks to all 
 those who made this success possible this optimism should carry us forward well into 2006 and beyond 
 102 he patrician 2005 association edmonton branch this the year of the veteran was a very productive and active year

 103 the patrician 2005 association for whatever reason or reasons we have had 20 members who have let their dues 
 fall into arrears in the past year or two or our membership would have been 85 regulars and 15 associates 
 at the annual general meeting of the association in wainwright 15 members including our entire executive attended the event and 
 festivities and all had a great time our branch was honoured to be asked to participate in the queen s 
 visit this past summer we were requested to have a contingent of veterans to attend and be in the presentation 
 line for her majesty at the legislative gardens our contingent consisted of world war ii vets korea vets nato tour 
 vets un peacekeeping vets as well as peacetime vets the picture submitted along with the article shows a proud group 
 of individuals our branch was presented at the unveiling of the general wm griesbach statue which was erected in the 
 heart of the old pmq area of griesbach this area has really changed with the demolition of many buildings and 
 the moving of some renovations etc the hamilton gault barracks as we knew them is almost all gone just one 
 barrack block remains the junior ranks club mess hall officers mess and quarters guard house the old western command building 
 etc all gone and replaced with highpriced 0:high 0:priced housing projects and dwellings in three years we are told all 
 of the remaining buildings in hamilton gault barracks will be totally demolished it is sad when one drives through the 
 area to see the demolitions and the buildings that have disappeared as we all have a lot of good memories 
 from past years in that area members of our branch were represented at six sites of remembrance day ceremonies two 
 in edmonton one in fort saskatchewan one in smokey lake one in chipman and one in westlock a number of 
 our members attended the memorial service for lcol jim stone members of the branch attended the junior ranks holiday dinners 
 for the first and third battalions at our own branch christmas dinner 44 were in attendance including a couple of 
 former patricias from the late 50s and 60s from new york city michael may and ollie oleksyn and his wife 
 from saskatoon and again as we do every year the branch was very generous with gifts for santas anonymous and 
 donations for the edmonton food bank our monthly meetings are still held at the kingsway legion at 1100 hours on 
 the fourth saturday of every month except july and august our december meeting depends when christmas falls if you are 
 ever in the area drop in and see us we love visitors the branch wishes everyone a great and prosperous 
 2006 see those who can make the agm in kingston this summer calgary branch january of 2005 found the executive

 up toronto way and after a hearty breakfast farewells were said until next year november the eleventh dawned clear and

 s by jack palmer and doug armstrong ascorted by the president of our branch bruce paxton and the vice president

 for our club members our 29th anniversary dinner originally slated for fairmont hot springs bc unfortunately required a last minute

 past cadets were awarded with a total of ten bronze and five silver pins for their achievements over the past 
 two years two ceremonies had been held during the previous year and with the addition of the awards at this 
 event brought the total count to 16 bronze and nine silver recipients for the 553 sgt tommy prince mm rcacc

 held some time in the future the 553 sgt tommy prince mm rcacc places a strong emphasis on physical fitness 
 skills community service and expeditions with the goal of promoting discipline confidence and self reliance 2701 ppcli army cadet corps 
 this past training year was yet another extraordinary one for the cadets of 2701 ppcli army cadet corps in winnipeg 
 manitoba the cadets of the unit participated in not only the regular training on the schedule such as class and 
 drill lectures and exercises but also in various corps activities the various corps activities range from saturday sports and the 
 corps shooting program to activities such as poppy drives and creating a christmas hamper for a family in need throughout 
 the september to june training year many of the cadets completed three corps exercises in shilo manitoba and st charles 
 range on the outskirts of winnipeg the first exercise of the year introduced the newer cadets to the basics of 
 being in the field orienteering and knots at the same time allowing older cadets to have a chance to show 
 themselves in the field and get an idea on what it means to be a section commander or 2lc the 
 second exercise was a winter exercises which showed the cadets different aspects of an exercise why it is important to 
 work together and taught them how to snowshoe navigate in the 
 the patrician 2005 125 cadets winter and why kit control is important the last exercise of the year was run 
 in the traditional fashion as section vs section competition the sections slept ate and moved from station to station as 
 a section being graded on all activities from their bivouac site and control of kit to the teamwork and motivation 
 the sections were also graded at each station they came to which included navigation knots cam and concealment and survival 
 it was clear after all three exercises that the cadets participating in each came back feeling more comfortable in the 
 field and for the most part learning something they did not already know everyone also seemed to have a great 
 time in the field as per usual later in the training year four of our cadets participated in nsce national 
 star certification examination and passed c wo greeley c wo gagne and former sgt s jackson and waldie along with 
 have a one hundred percent pass rate c wo greeley was awarded the general howard award for the top score
