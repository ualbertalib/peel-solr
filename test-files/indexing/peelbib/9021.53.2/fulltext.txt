 democracies cartoonists re watchdogs of society trying to make during the 1920 s and 1930 s home grown politicians and

 spring 2005 albertan these include ben wicks sid banon tom innes edd ulushak malcolm mayes vance rodewalt john yardley jones
 and a host of others a noteworthy addition to the list is everett soop a blood indian cartoonist for the
 kainai news whose started in 1968 and whose political satire played no favourites between native and white many of the
 cartoons in this special issue are unauthored or were submitted to a newspaper by an amateur artist whose name means
 little or nothing to us today other cartoonists such as rodewalt innes and cameron have become nationally famous with books
 of cartoons being produced to exhibit their art and wit in addition some institutions hold collections of original cartoons such
 as those of innes soop and cameron at the glenbow archives and the ones at the canadian museum of caricature
 and other a rchives cartoons are a visual form of journalism that can be critical supportive or inspirational they are
 a form of art an example of humour and a means of making a social statement they have shaped public
 opinion such as in cameron s attack of social credit and provided readers with an easy summary of major economic
 or political events if however cartoons appear in partisan press they may clearly show a political bias liberal conservative new
 democratic of the newspaper through a biting humour that savagely attacks a politician or the government of the day everyone
 is familiar with the images of leaders that appear in cartoons they have a strong likeness to the person but
 exaggerate certain features to make them amusing tyrannical or benevolent according to the tone of the message being transmitted to
 the reader on the other hand cartoons can be politically neutral simply recording an important event or promoting local boosterism
 political cartoons also are an excellent way of depicting history in this issue we have selected a number that have
 appeared since 1905 that virtually tell the histor y of alberta it is amazing how many historic events are portrayed
 in the form of cartoons some of our discoveries of cartoons were surprising for example making light of the 1918
 influenza epidemic telling of the development of marquis wheat and the migration to peace river during the depression were unexpected
 bonuses not everything is covered in some instances we were completely unable to find an image for an important event
 simply because it did not lend itself to the medium or after searching thousands of newspapers we could not find
 it some topics missing are the hillcrest mine disaster beginning of northern flying polio epidemics and their eradication v e
 day and others that readers can probably recall but what we do have is a look at alberta s last
 hundred years through the eyes of political cartoonists hugh dempsey is editor of alberta history the editor was not immune
