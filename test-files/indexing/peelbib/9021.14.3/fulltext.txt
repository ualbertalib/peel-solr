 thomas mcmicking edited by hugh a dempsey whenever gold was discovered in some remote part of the world the news
 always had an electrifying effect whether the discovery was in california australia or the kiondike thousands of men were ready
 to cast aside their normal lives and rush off in search of their eldorado when news of the cariboo gold
 field discoveries was spread in 1861 many ontario adventurers looked cit their maps and decided that fortune was only a
 short distance away rather than risk the long boat trip around cape horn the gold seekers decided to cross the
 prairies and rockies by the most direct route men from st catherines ont formed the nucleus of one party while
 others were organized at toronto huron and st peters as they prepared to leave they were joined by men from
 st thomas huntington ottawa montreal acton whitby waterloo scarborough london goderich and chatham these men became known as the overlanders
 of 1862 the st catherines party was led by thomas mcmicking who at the end of his journey wrote an
 account of his trip we are fortunate to be able to reproduce the alberta portion of this journey taken from
 a copy in the alberta provincial library the mcmicking party left st catherines on april 23 rd 1862 and travelled
 by rail to grand haven michigan from there they took the steamer detroit to milwaukee the railway to lacross and
 the steamer frank steele to st paul minn an overland journey then took them north to the red river settlement
 the jumping off place for their epic journey when they left red river on june 2 nd the party consisted
 132 men one woman and three children by the time they reached fort edmonton they had added another fourteen men
 to their number the party passed portage ia prairie on june 6 th fort ellice on june 14 th and
 carlton on july 1 st the latter part of their journey had been made extremely difficult by the desertion of
 their guide from canton they pushed on to fort pitt which was reached on july 9 th the account published

 time in the same manner as we had previously done all getting over safely we had often heard and read
 of the beauty and fertility of the great saskatchewan valley but after travelling through it for nearly a month we
 were satisfied that all description had failed to convey to the mind a full and accurate idea of its vast
 extent the exuberance of its vegetation the surpassing beauty of some of its parts or its fitness and capacity for
 becoming the homes of a dense population that in short the country must be seen to be appreciated the hudson

 the first party bought canoes from the shuswap indians while others built rafts although they knew nothing about the river
 the first adventurers set out on sept 1 st followed by others as their crafts were ready by sept 11

 along the turbulent fraser river were the bodies of four men who had perished a c robertson j carpenter and

 of exposure the second party consisting of about twenty people had a nightmarish twoweek overland journey to the thompson when

 to abandon their rafts but built new ones below the rapids and reached fort kamloops on oct 11 th from

 charge of the negotiations wanted to have as many chiefs of the tribes present as possible accordingly he sent his
 assistant james doty on an expedition into southern alberta to contact any bands of indians which normally hunted or traded
 on american territory he was instructed to contact all american indians as opposed to the more northern british indians to
 inform them of the treaty conference the treaty which was signed on october 17 th 1855 attempted to establish peaceful
 relations among the warring tribes and with the american government it also gave the tribes 20 000 annually in gifts
 for ten years and 15 000 annually for the introduction of agriculture and education the report of doty s journey
