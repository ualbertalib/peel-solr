 guaranteed era of the big ranches by sheilagh s jameson probably every country and every area has a romantic period
 in its history in southern alberta the early ranching years must qualify as its golden days although it was a
 brief period from 15 to 25 years it was one of great consequence but largely because of the shortness of
 its hey day and the greatness of its impact many misconceptions regarding the ranching era have arisen it is not
 always realized that the and cattle rustlers which preyed upon southern prairie section of western the cattle trails and upon
 ranchers who canada was founded by the cattlemen were trying to establish herds indian that the big ranches preceded general
 wars particularly unt 1 the custer battle settlement and that their operation was in 1876 added to the general picture
 distinctive differing greatly from that of violence and strife the completion of of the settler or homesteader who came a
 railroad across the territory in 1869 in and proved up on his quarter sec with the resultant increased influx of

 from history to fiction and back again by dorothy m johnson a writer who uses history as a source looks
 for the emotion in it history is full of tremendous emotion but if you are writing straight history so many
 facts have to be crowded into so few words that the emotion sometimes gets squeezed out historians have to boil
 down a dramatic event stressing what led up to it and what the result was the layman wants to see
 something legend but seeing those names i knew happening to people if they don t seem those men were real
 and they were alive when he s reading he ll leave angry and they died they were no you the
 little things are important to longer just characters who wore threehim cornered hat and knee pants when i visited the
 tower of london it is not so easy to base fiction on the guide pointed out a cottage that historical
 fact at it might seem start henry viii once gave to anne boleyn ing with fact you have some foundation
 he said that later when she was a to work on you have less imagining to prisoner in the tower
 she lived in that do this should make historical fiction cottage and could hear the men build easy to write
 but it s not because the ing the scaffold this horrible bit never facts get in the way of the
 imagination came up in the english history course how much does a writer dare change i tcok but anne boleyn
 is real to me how much will his conscience let him now change how much dialogue may he at edinburgh
 castle the old man who attribute to his characters when he can t was showing us around took us to
 the prove that these real people said any bleak room where mary queen of scots such thing he has a

 through telling the scenes of horror and courage and des vigilantes what she thought of them pair well i moved
 them around to find they knew they d heard something this out where they connected and there was is so
 good as fact that it doesn t need a story published with the title flame any fictionizing i used it
 as background on the 1 rontier this wasn t historical there was no need to change any of it fiction
 these people were purely ima the story i wrote is about a hard ginary but they evolved without effort luck
 family purely imaginary who were on my part from one footnote about the there at the time and were influenced
 massacre at new ulm minnesota by these events you know who jim bridger was sometimes a tiny bit of history
 is one of the mountain men one of the enough to start the dreaming process most famous of that sturdy
 crew cecil that produces fiction some years ago i alter wrote his biography and there came across a footnote in
 death on horse was something in it that made me want back by paul weilman this refers to the to
 cry when jim bridger was an old minnesota massacre in 1862 man he was blind and he used to go
 the story of merton eastlick and his out in the fields at the farm where he devotion to his baby
 brother johnny is lived and kneel down to feel how high worth re telling when the indians struck lake shetek
 settlement the eastlick the grain had grown the story i wrote family hid with other settlers in the wasn t
 about an old blind mountain man rushes of a stream bed the sioux found named jim bridger i called him
 cal them killed john eastlick the father and crawford my mountain man was not three of the five boys mrs
 eastlick was captured only blind but senile this is from the before they found her she hid her story as
 told by a young boy baby johnny and charged his only surviving brother merton never to leave him one day
 old cal began to talk to until he died mrs eastlick eventually people i could not see we were riding
 escaped from the indians and was found along beside a grove suddenly he by august garzine a mail carrier crazed
 chuckled he pointed ahead and said with belief that her whole family was good beaver there last year plenty blackfoot
 too waughf dead he took her to new ulm on the way forty miles from the scene of the did
 you want to go back now mr massacre they found merton and johnny crawford i asked the lad had carried
 the baby every foot he swung around scowling and said of the way hiding from the indians and something in
 a language that was not subsisting on berries he was an emaci english then he ignored the interruption ated skeleton
 with the flesh worn off and went on talking loudly in some his bore feet and was unable to speok
 tongue unknown to me gesturing telling for days afterward but the baby was a story along with the spoken language
 safe and sound he used the sign talk of the prairie tribes the night after i read that some but
 more gracefully more swiftly then i had ever seen it i got a few of the signs thing very strange
 happened i had a men riding an evil person somebody massacre in my bedroom while i was dead to the
 rider on his left he spoke trying to go to sleep all i wanted was and to the rider on
 his right i was on his right but it was not to me he told to get a night s
 rest i didn t want to his story it was to someone i could not write a story but suddenly
 a lot of see someone who wasn t there 12 and the comrades of long ago must fictional narrative then
 in the book of have answered because once in a while biographies called some went west i told he laughed
 he pointed off toward the place where prairie met the sky and fanny kelly s story the way it really
 kicked his horse into a faster walk i happened it s nice to be able to use kept behind him
 shivering your research more than once long afterward when historians re the theme of the white woman capvived the legend
 of cal crawford i knew in what company i had ridden that day tive is tremendously dramatic of course the
 ghosts were bearded trappers in there were lots of them jack schaefer fringed buckskin long haired men with and i
 both used the true story of fanny shapeless headgear or fur moccasined men who rode like wary kings who had
 kelly as the basis for fiction with no forgotten fear but not caution and mention of fanny kelly his story
 is indians too rode with us half naked called sergeant houck in which a tough curious cruel with paint stripes
 on their old army sergeant is assigned to restore dark faces and hair in long black locks like snakes a
 captured white woman to her husband it was i who was invisible cal craw along with her two year old
 son who ford was young again in a time long had an indian father fanny kelly s naryears before i
 was born rative was schaefer s springboard for it is interesting to see how two sergeaiit houck and my journey
 to the fort but i don t think anyone except the writers starting with the same historical authors would know
 it source material write very different stories i came across a book called jack schaefer came across a serious narrative
 of my captivity among the sioux problem using history in fiction he was indians by fanny kelly mrs kelly was
 doing research for a novel called corn 19 years old when she was captured puny of cowards it was about
 a group her little niece mary was captured too of civil war officers each of whom fanny tried to save
 the little girl but had been disgraced for cowardice in little mary was killed and scalped but battle they redeemed
 themselves and after several months fanny kelly was that is what the story is about schaefer ransomed by her husband
 i found my got his idea from a paragraph in a self moving inside the mind of this poor stillness
 at appoinattox by bruce cation frantic woman identifying with her this this paragraph casually mentioned a is one of the
 peculiar things about writ company q made up of court martialled ing fiction i have to be the people officers
 so schaefer started tracking it sometimes it s a nightmare down wanting to use whatever facts there were but research
 brought to light but i didn t write the true story of the sad fact that there weren t any
 facts fanny kelly in my story she had an about company q other name and the circumstances were however schaefer
 wasn t writing different she was ransomed and re history by this time he had thought turned to a frontier
 fort and she was so much about company q that one close to madness because she felt guilty man in
 it was real to him and absolutely about little mary in my story the had to be written about company
 of woman was older than 19 and mary cowards is about that man and some was her daughter not her
 niece and other men it doesn t purport to be his mary was at the fort when she got tory
 it isn t based on history but it s there this story was called journey to so real that you
 can t help feeling it tire fort and it s an example of the use actually happened because that s
 the of history as the basis for an entirely kind of writer jack schaefer is open range we understand that

 deer river before crossing the bridge he will see on his right facing south and adjoining the highway beautiful red
 lodge park and camping ground nearby red lodge post office was opened in 1894 eleven years before alberta became a
 province the reason for its name seems to point to the residence of mr and mrs thomas critchley early ranchers
 of the district who opened and ran the office from its beginning to 1898 when they sold out and left
 the district critchley a former captain from the british army bought a whole section of land about a mile up
 the river from the present red lodge bridge most of which extended over on the west side of the river
 on the slope of the bank on the east side he built a huge fourteen room house fabricated by the
 best axemen available with hewed logs beautifully dovetailed the front part of the house was planned for themselves and the
 back part for servants and ranch helpers the entire front of the house was painted red and it must be
 for this reason that the post office was named red lodge 4 i the house itself reminded one of an
 old country manor mrs critchley daughter of sir sandford fleming proved herself to be the perfect hostess and added charm
 both to her home and to the surrounding district as a wedding gift sir sanford is said to have given
 to the critchleys one hundred purebred hereford cows in addition to their hereford stock the critchleys kept a number of
 fine horses both for riding and for general ranch and farm work they also kept a full supply of tools
 and implements to meet the needs of any ranch or farm of that day with such a set up as

 field cloakey soon sold the whole section and equipment to the stokes brothers william and frank this the critchleys although
 a kind and gentle couple were held somewhat aloof by the surrounding neighbors who in their humble abodes some of

 it is a common fact that english people in general know little of canada but it is to be hoped
 that they will no altogether gather their ideas about it from writings of their countrymen visiting it for a short
 time and writing their impressions with scarcely an exception these travellers do make the most dangerous statements though amusing to
 us who know the case recently calgary has been suffering from this cause a settler s wife first telling old
 country people that farming was a failure in this district though she forgot to tell them that her own situation
 was chosen for scenery and not for agriculture as the agent warned her at the time now an english m
 mr w s caine makes some ridiculous remarks about the town hardly a woman to be seen on the streets
 the population a swarm of cowboys farmers idlers and young men of rough occupation all the men in the place
 swarming to salvation army meetings etc why calgary is a large thriving town introducing electric light water works and other
 evidences of advanced civilization it contains fine houses excellent stores good churches and other usual buildings while its schools hotels
 and other public places are first class it has a telephone system a fire brigade railway station post office telegraph
 office and all the incidental accessories of modern life perhaps the best test of all is that it sustains three
 large and excellent newspapers two weekly and one monthly the tribune herald and live stock journal its population contains a
 large proportion of males certainly but it is entirely misleading to intimate that it is composed as mr caine says
 the people are the equal in ability intelligence and propriety of any place the same size in canada and includes
 scores of ladies as fair and refined as would be met in the same sized town in the british empire
 the place itself is the centre of a very large and important district rich in stock raising and agricultural advantages
 in minerals and timber in game and furs with the valuable aids of delicious water charming scenery a beautiful climate
 and abundant coal fuel future travellers might remember that here cowboys and farmers are not classed with idlers and roughs
 they are considered necessary and respectable members of our society the latter as everywhere else being the most valuable element
