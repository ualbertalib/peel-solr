 the sod house by frank gilbert roe i do not know what actually led to the choice of a sod
 house for our first prairie home in july 1894 no doubt necessity had much to do with it although an
 experienced hand could make a good job of building one in the very nature of things such structures were inevitably
 less permanent than log or frame houses i never heard of anyone building one for a permanent choice where the
 other materials were at all readily to be had they were essentially a creation of the treeless plains where other
 raw materials were not easily obtainable frame houses were exceptional in pitied the man who built one because the early
 days in our neighborhood and logs weren t good enough we scorned nobody envied their possessors they when the adult
 members of our needed to be heated and insulated with family were introduced to their future something of the modern
 thoroughness domain ten miles east of blackfalds to be at all tolerable and few men could by the landguide they
 were not the run to it the man who built a frame first to view the promise land a wanderhouse
 because he couldn t get logs we ing pilgrim from the western states a dr roe was born in sheffield
 england and came to alberta in 1894 after leaving the homestead he joined the grand trunk i acific railway later
 the c n r as a member of the coal gang and retired as an engineer in 1943 during his
 service he was secretary to a joint committee of locomotive engineers and firemen in negotiating a schedule agreement with tile
 railway in 1919 and similarly in the following year in the amalgamation negotiations between the c n r and at
 icr companies comprising the system a historian he gained considerable prominence for his the north american buffalo university of toronto

 tile university of alberta and was elected to the royal society of canada two earlier papers of his were published

 look for immediate neighbors were from eastern direction on such matters as a much canada while they were mostly skilled
 more mature canadian than any of us woodsmen they knew no more about there was no mention of building building

 art of sod house construction there stead fee and the landguide s charges was nothing to disturb our comfortable the
 family had almost exactly ten conviction that sod was sod quite undollars nor was this offset by teams troubled by
 any qualms we turned to ploughs wagons or dairy stock objects the soft rich black sod of the firebreak which
 rendered many a beginner a which lay ready to our hands forturelatively well to do man nately the breaking ploughs
 of 1894 in then too log timber suitable for the hands of a skillful ploughman could building proved to be
 some distance go from one end of a field to the other away and not easy of access in summer
 without breaking the furrow slice time the nearest lumber yards even had funds permitted were respectively it frequently proved convenient

 people were length and grass side down on a short too busy breaking new land or prepar piece of board
 from there they could ing for early hay making to embark upon be slid into position with less danger such
 winter occupations as logging or of them cracking in our hands even freighting for any less inducement we first decided
 to dig out a couple than spot cash perhaps in the existing of feet of soil inside the walls this
 was circumstances there wasn t much choice done after building up an equal height in the matter of sod wall
 all round to prevent our excavated soil from falling in again straight poles two to three inches thick although this
 later proved to be really laid closely from ridge to eaves and necessary there is a lingering suspicion nailed there
 for greater rigidity the that laziness perhaps labour saving roof was also of sod over a good thickis a more
 dignified term had something ness of coarse slough hay with a gento do with our decision at the moment erous
 top dressing of clay over all to there would be so much less wall to cover the joints in the
 sod the hay was build up laid next to the poles to reduce the dust the little knoll no more
 than a tiny the roof as a whole therefore was swelling facilitated this and in a sense clearly the heaviest
 feature in the work visibly justified this action but it also even a wallplate of broad plank the became apparent
 after a time that in full width of the fourteen inch sod wall addition to greater warmth and comfort could
 hardly have carried such a weight it would have been virtually impossible without thrusting out the wall upon to have
 a durable and clean earthen which it rested and in any case we had floor without going down through the
 no plank the only sawmill material in soft fertile loam to the harder clay sub the entire construction was in
 the door soil below we therefore dug out an and window frames and in the door area eighteen feet by

 edges of our sod walls light poles from the woods the plates lush with the edges of the excavation themselves
 light poles were supported the northern and eastern walls were along the two long sides by posts at to be
 windowless in these it was there intervals roughly resembling in prirlfore feasible to build up a considerable ciple the studding
 of a frame house section of the wall self supporting these were set in a little to be flush laying
 the sod like brickwork with the with the inner face of the sod wall the joints broken or staggered but
 the door sods at those points being channelled way in the southern end and the small in a little to
 make them fit closely the window on the western side brought us face to face with the question of wall
 plates to support the roof and further after living in their sod house for a year the author s family
 moved into the log house support for these themselves in turn shown below nine years later the sod roof the

 from the government that than representative institutions patents for these lands be at once issued to this end the government

 in the vicinity of the town of calgary to satisfy the squatters more immediate have been withdrawn from entry for
 demands senator cochrane was per as we believe no sufficient reason and suaded to relinquish land in the bow intending
 settlers have been thus driven valley towards which settlement seemed away we require that these and other townships in this

 shortly after 7 o clock wednesday night in front of the union bank on the principal business street of the
 city by richard christian a cowpuncher who has been in the city for the past few days from the iron
 springs district the shooting is said to be the result of an old feud between the two egan arrested christian
 on several different occasions during the past two years christian is said to have made the remarks at each time
 that it would be only a short time until he would get him the shooting was most sensational as the
 streets were crowded at the time with hundreds of pedestrians the wounded man was shot in the back about four
 inches below the right shoulder the bullet coming out of his side near the top of the stomach inflicting a
 severe intestinal wound after being shot egan walked a short distance and asked for a gun he staggered a short
 distance and just as he was falling was assisted by a number of bystanders who rushed him across the street
 where medical attention was given a few minutes later he was taken to the galt hospital where it was necessary
 to perform an operation immediately christian after firing the shot started off in an opposite direction running into the arms
 of sergt kroning of the police force who pulled his gun and commanded him to throw up his hands christian
 handed over his gun and was escorted to the city police station where he was locked up in a separate
 cell where he talked of the crime egan had ordered me out of town on several different occasions and at
 one time was instrumental in having me sent up for stealing a watch when he passed me on the street
 he applied a vile name to me and i promptly pulled my gun and shot i am not sorry that
 i shot him and would do it again under the circumstances as i will not take the name he called
 me under any circumstances from anyone and if i was to swing for it tomorrow i would still be glad
 that i committed the deed the prisoner is about 27 years of age but states that he does not know

 time the eastern troop mg the raid to battle river the whole exaressed sympathy with the poor column moved on
 down the river toward indians and lots of us doubted whether fort pitt but general strange had left some of
 the men particularly the memorders for us to hasten on after them hers of the 65 th would fight the
 indians after resting our horses that were very when we got at them but what a change tired and wore
 we started on the road of attitude the scene at frog lake made east by forced marches on the way

 hiding place and then went to indians were said to be there waiting get the horse of the fallen man
 when for us the men were in a very angry this was done it was found that neither mood at
 what they had seen and they horse or rider had been touched nor made fort pitt that day there we
 found was there a dead indian this did not the body of the police scout cowan who prevent the camp
 from being alarmed had been killed seven weeks before it when the guard in camp heard the likewise mutilated and
 insulted which shooting they properly sounded the did not allay the harsh feelings of the bugle which set the whole
 camp in active men toward the noble red man motion the excitement was just nicely at fort pitt a permanent
 camp was settling down and men thinking of going laid out close to what remained of the back to bed
 when about a hundred confort a stockade was built around it and voy mules started to bray as if in
 ridicule all settled down to rest up both men of the big fuss over nothing no person and horses that
 most certainly needed a slept any more that night real rest the mounted rifles horses steele s scouts and the
 few police were very tired and were given several brigaded with us were kept busy for a days extra to
 recuperate few days scouting until our horses got up to this time we had not seen any rested then we
 all took up that duty hostile indians but they were around trying to locate the big bunch of big and
 knew all about us one night sev bear s followers there were several eral attempts were made to get into
 the clashes of patrols and one night three horse lines but the guards stopped that indians were killed one of
 the indians every time on another occasion one was chief of the onion lake reserve of the men on horse
 guard was shot at called mwninook a six foot four and half he was riding along the river bank when
 inch indian that night the locality of an indian shot at him from the brush big bear s camp was
 discovered which grew on the bank his horse of the whole camp was now ordered course was startled and jumped
 in fear to move except a small guard for the 16 stores at fort pitt all moved out and they
 found seventeen dead horses some marched north in the direction of french with blood on their back but not an
 man s butte our troop was in the ad indian the whole column marched on vance and steele s scouts
 as rear guard over frenchman s butte and went into we marched on until near noon when camp for the
 night just east of it that the advance guard was following the night there were several attempts made trail up
 frenchman s butte when the to get into the horse lines but every first indians were sighted the advance attempt
 was prevented and we all slept guard consisting of eight men who were well followed by the connecting link of
 in the morning we took the trail as double force two hundred yards behind usual on toward onion lake steele
 s were about half way up the butte when scouts in the advance then the 65 th some indians came
 out of the brush battalion then the 91 st and then the behind the advance the men of the transport
 wagons we had advanced connecting link dismounted and opened perhaps three miles when the indians fire this drove the indians
 back to cover opened fire on our advance guard our troop was advancing in skirmish the indians had chosen an
 impregnaing order extended at fifty yards on ble position the country generally was each side of the road in half
 sections about half covered with timber and the the butte was covered with small timber other half open spaces covered
 with in patches but at the top was a large bald place about twenty acres on grass or small bushes
 here was an open this the indians gathered in considerable space of considerable size with a muskeg on the north
 side which looked like a numbers nice green hay meadow but when you when the indians first showed in tried
 to go on it disappeared and you sight the halt was ordered we all laid were up to the neck
 in water with no down where we were and the troops bottom on the north side of the muskeg were
 formed up on a smaller hill to the was a small hill or rising ground in big west of frenchman
 s butte about three timber right down to near the water quarters of a mile from the top of french
 in this they had dug trenches about man s butte the convoy wagons were four feet deep and had logs
 placed so all brought up and formed into a corral that they could fire from under the logs with the
 gun the nine pounder pointed without exposing themselves to our fire toward the indians while all this was they had
 taken up and removed all logs being done we lay in the brush doing that had been used in the
 corduroy nothing but watching the indians on crossing thus leaving the road impassthe butte they had gathered in con able
 the muskeg on the east was about siderable numbers both mounted and two hundred yards wide and narrowed on foot
 they were yelling a sto t to about fifty yards at the crossing the seiuu ugn u s ‘‘ asmuun
 put guutnauea saying approach to this position was all ex come on white man and fight many posed to a
 direct fire from the trenches were shooting at the troops formed up in the trenches were the whole band of
 on the other hill they were capering big bear s followers we of course never and boasting what they would
 do when knew how many there were but the there came a huge belch of black smoke smoke from their
 guns was continuous which made them all stop short there the whole length of the trenches which was a considerable
 space when all was was at least a quarter of a mile long still and the new cheer was just
 started the general opinion was that there were when a perfectly timed shell burst right about twelve hundred indians in
 the where it should have that cut short camp all capering there we then got the order the troops were
 formed up while the to advance which we did the gun fired wagons were corralled when the order two or
 three shells after that but there was given to advance the 65 th extended was no indian in sight not
 a man fired and went forward to the water s edge a shot with his rifle and that is what
 indeed a number went in up to their happened at frenchman s butte necks only to find that they could
 not when our men got to the bald place even swim because of the tall grass 17 they then lay
 down and fired at the the general ordered to gun to fire on trenches which was all that could be
 that man the writer carried the order done two companies of the 91 st were and when captain strange who
 had sent east along the muskeg trying to charge of the gun asked the gunner find a crossing but they
 found it getting o connor can you hit that man the worse as they approached the river some gunner replied
 be japers i ll ate what s ten miles off steele s scouts and some left of him and so
 he could have the police searched the water for about eight shell made its perfect centre and all miles upstream
 but could find no pos went up in smoke parties who went over sible crossing the general then ordered there
 some time after said parts of the the troops to withdraw out of rifle range indian was wound around limbs
 of trees and went into camp for the night forty feet in the air during the engagement the old nine
 the indians withdrew that night sounder was very active a considerable without making any attempt on our number of shells
 were sent into the camp to even steal horses which they indians position and several times are much better at
 than fighting we silenced the firing of rifles and brought had seven men wounded all of the 65 th yells
 from the indians near the place one was badly hurt as the bullet went of explosion one old indian got
 a piece right through his chest yet he recovered of a blanket attached to a pole which and was around
 before the camp was he held in front of himself while the broken up this action was called at others
 continued to fire on our lines the time stand off coulee and was the route taken by the author s
 party is shown above from calgary they went to edmonton to laboucan s crossing back to edmonton on to fort
 pitt and to the battles of frenchman s butte and loon lake modern features such as the provincial boundaries and
 the towns of lloydminster and camrose are added to make the map easier to follow 18 noted for loss of
 good ammunition rather the indians because were were not half than the destruction of an enemy even with them the
 indians then started north to it was about two o clock in the mornward loon lake but had to pass
 the ing when the major came around our onion lake indian reserve on their way sleeping tents simply roaring get
 up here several small bands left the main men get up get eight days half band and started off in
 every direction rations all the ammunition you can attempting to get away from big bear and follow me and up
 the trail steele some of them came back on the main went as hard as his horse could lope trail
 but several started toward green accordingly every man in the camp got lake in consequence of this there were up
 got whatever rations he could handle several prisoners in the camp including and filled everything he had with am mrs
 gowanlock and mrs delaney munition and up the trail after steele whose husbands were killed at frog with us were
 three or four teamsters lake the mounted troops were sent after who mounted their wagon horses and the many trails
 trying to rescue the followed in the morning when we numprisoners hence we were divided up bored off in a
 small opening we had into small raiding bands all working 73 men all told in line two officers and overtime
 with head camp at onion lake one brigade sergeant major fury a reserve one of these bands found the mounted
 policeman and a real soldier two women in a camp of a half breed named prichard who had bought them
 the country throughwhich the by paying four fine eastern heavy brood indians had travelled was timbered with mares harness and
 democrat prichard small timber some open places and thus saved the two women from worse numerous muskegs sloughs w a
 t e r than death and was never yet rewarded courses and bogs all that would burn at least he
 said so five ears after had been burnt all roads had been desy troyed by the indians in their flight
 the camp at onion lake reserve was everything to impede our march was the headquarters of the mounted men done
 even to felling large trees across under major steele to round up the stray the trail they did the very
 things they bunches of indians while the other foot could to make us trouble but stop and troops were sent
 back to fort pitt frog fight we did not have an axe to cut the lake and cold lake where
 it was trees to clear the road and had to qet thought big bear would make for where around the
 best way we could the he would have the rough country and horses had to be pulled across the heavy
 timbered country to fight in this sloughs and muskegs in one place one proved true as was afterwards learned of
 the horses broke his leg and had to it was also well known that unless some be shot the suffering
 of the horses was further attempt was made big bear most terrible no feed save what little might not hurry
 himself once he had got slough grass we could pull by hand and free from the column following him it
 with but slight nourishment covered steele said we must have another go with mosquitoes all the time tormented at him
 hence cis many men as could with deer flies that fastened themselves be got were collected at onion lake on
 every place they could sucking the and were waiting for more to come in blood out of the poor beasts
 out of the to swell the number as much as possible 73 horses at the start only forty seven made
 the trip and twenty six lived to while we were waiting word came get back to onion lake when a
 man to the camp that general middleton the lost his horse he started to walk back to commander in chief
 had landed at fort wnere we starte pitt with a lot more troops it was also generally believed that once
 he came on the fourth day toward evening all chance of another fight would be we had two men shot
 at and wounded gone indeed while we were talking of fish lost his right elbow and findley it the order
 was on its way to steele was shot in the thigh we knew that we ordering him to come in
 with all his were close onto the indians so the march troops and to stop all operations against was slowed
 down and scouts sent on 19 the first ford at loon lake near the scene of the battle was photographed
 by capt fames peters a few days after the fight a number of the troops are seen making the crossing
 ahead they found the indian camp on but otherwise open but the higher land a very small creek that emptied
 into rose to but small rises and covered with loon lake from the east it was dark trees and open
 places so common in that so we all lay down for several hours then country proceeded on for a few
 miles some as soon as steele got word that the heard a shot and then we left our horses men
 could see their sights he jumped tied to trees with four men to guard up started down into the low
 land with them and the balance went on foot with a revolver in each hand and said come steele it
 was still very dark when we on men kill all the black elk you can came to where we could
 see the indian all hands dashed as fast as they could camp and all settled down to wait for after
 steele immediately after steele daylight we numbered off in a whisper started the indians in the trees to the and
 got instructions in a whisper we north of the creek opened fire on us could see the indians working like
 mad but not a shot was fired by us when moving their camp and many taking we got to the
 camp the even numbered up positions to fight us all odd num men set to work destroying the camp and
 bored men were ordered to go on up the looking for prisoners and the odd numlittle rise of ground on
 the other side bored pressed up and opened fire on the of the creek and drive off any indians indians
 posted there there were a conposted there and the even numbered siderable number of indians in the camp men were
 to destroy the camp rescue proper when the charge was made and the prisoners if any as we did not
 know they then made for the trees where we at that time that the two white women were busy driving
 out that batch this had been found the creek bottom was brought fire on our rear as the indians flat
 generally with a few bunches of in the timber fought back fury saw this scrub trees and willows near the
 mouth and came with a few men and drove the 20 indians right onto the odd men i had started
 to drive on not fast but very care indians run by me within ten feet and fully he advanced and
 it was not long we were all very busy attending to them until he heard our rifles they came in
 as soon as steele had destroyed the singles in small squads at first then as camp to his satisfaction he
 came up steele came closer they came in fifty under the shelter where the odd num or more in a
 bunch they would break bored men were the indians in the out of the timber to cross the open place
 meantime had posted a considerable only to get our fire then they would number of men on the very ground
 we dash for the creek bank or timber to occupied when we started out of the our left on the
 lake bank i saw a good timber they also had a lot between us number of indians fall and a
 lot stay and the lake but away from the creek where they fell and also saw wounded bottom these we
 drove out and they ran crawl off and let them go how many off in the timber and then around
 to the indians steele drove on we could no other side of the creek the way we knew more than
 guess steele asked us how this was because of the indian wander many arid the general estimated from ing spirit
 whom we heard in both five to seven hundred we dared not even places we then settled down to firing
 attempt to look over the bank either on indians in the water crossing the toward the creek or lake but
 we could lake and in trees on the other side of hear lots of groaning from suffering the lake as
 well as the indians who had indians were asked how they liked killbeen driven out of the camp and from
 ing helpless people and was told to go around the camp this went on for sev to the indian hell
 eral hours each part watching to get steele then sent several men back to the other we were in a
 very unpleasant the indian camp for a buckboard and position we were we thought eighty two carts that had been
 saved from miles from onion lake with no rations destruction to carry our wounded these limited ammunition and some distance
 were hauled by hand until we got back from our horses and steele set himself to our horses with our
 wounded and to get us out indians wounded of whom we had steele sent twelve men under an three then
 we took blankets and made officer to work through the brush along harnesses for the carts and buckboard the lake
 cross the creek and get into the made travois for others and loaded on timber on the lake bank and
 there to hide the wounded who could not ride while in a selected location we made the tim this was
 being done not an indian came ber all right without the indians on our near us showing that they had
 had side of the lake seeing us but the indians enough kept a heavy fire on us all the way
 along then came the march back with three the lake one man was armed with a big wounded indians one
 helpless we had sharps and we had to respect him when to repair the roads but this time we we
 had had time enough to make the had some tools taken from the indian place steele sent about the same
 num camp and made onion lake on the 5 th ber by the same way but they instead day but
 with only twenty six horses out of joining us went further up the creek of the seventy three one horse
 that bank before they disclosed themselves foaled made the twenty seventh a few and opened fire then steele came over
 days after george hall s horse laid with all the rest down and died hall walked as did all the
 position then was that we had others or rode in turn with others but the first thirteen men in ambush
 in a three days after in it came looking for selected place with a nice open patch oats when this
 fight was reported to about fifty yards wide armed with general middleton he refused to believe repeating winchester 45 70
 and revol it he is reported to have said imposvers of many kinds the main body of siblel steele would
 never dare to attack indians were thus placed between steele that body of indians with so few men and the
 ambush of this ambush i am two weeks after steele went back over sure they had not the slightest notion
 the same road with about three hundred when steele got all of his men over he men and it then
 appeared that there had 21 two members of steele s scouts were photographed by capt peters during the rebellion feters
 was perhaps the only person to take pictures of the rebellion during the actual conflicts been a real fight colonel
 otter of the when he expected to be scalped etc queen s own was one of those who went when
 he was discharged as cured he over the ground said that was the only was given a new suit of
 clothes blanket fight he had seen worth talking about with some other small things he went this in a speech
 at toronto on his return back to his people to live but owing the column on the second visit found
 to his strong and continued championnumerous new graves and several dead ship of the whites the indians held a yet
 unburied one was a beautiful young council and decided that he had better squaw who had been badly wounded go
 and live with the whites he was and had hanged herself yet with all ordered off the reserves and left
 the this evidence and our own wounded wood crees altogether came to macand three wounded prisoners general leod where he
 lived for twenty five middleton refused to report the battle years until he died as i could speak out of
 all the men in our troop in all the cree language i got very intimate forty seven we had seven
 hurt bad with him and we had many a long talk enough that they had to be looked after about
 the war lone man told me that and we had nineteen in all hit a lot at frenchman s butte
 the indians had were hit with shot but the range was seven men killed by the first shell and too
 long for it to be anywhere near as many wounded at stand off coulee effective he said that there were
 ten killed and the indian prisoner lone man was wounded in the trenches but that one attended to with all
 the kindness usual shell that was fired into the back timber 22 killed a lot of women and children who
 got there they battled with the flour cakes were camped there lone man estimated the battle was seen by someone
 who from what he saw up to the time he was gave the alarm and looking at the cache wounded
 and from what he saw and one could just see small puffs of smoke heard after he returned to the
 reserves the order was given to go to the relief that the indians had suffered very of the men thought
 to be attacked the heavily he said there must have been troops marched out at the double with seventy five
 perhaps a hundred killed full orders to battle but they were met or wounded he was in the camp several
 by the salvage men and every man of months after he got out of the hospital them was a casualty
 the poor teamand had a chance to learn a lot he said sters were worse than any from aphe had
