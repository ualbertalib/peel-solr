 for the toronto globe accompanied the marquis of lorne governor general of canada during a tour of the west when
 the official party turned south to montana williams decided to visit edmonton to check reports he had received about the
 agricultural possibilities there his experiences were published as a series in the globe and upon his return williams edited them
 and reprinted them in the booklet manitoba and the north west journal of a trip from toronto to the rocky
 mountains hunter rose co toronto 1882 interestingly williams implies that his party was made up only of his guide peter
 countois and a young metis named john warren yet he was actually accompanied by another man alexander begg correspondent for
 the toronto mail begg had come west to look over prospects for a ranch which he later established at the
 confluence of the bow and highwood rivers and made part of the return journey with his fellow newspaperman begg s
 diary of the trip is now in the glenbow archives calgary so to add to the interest of williams account
 his entries are included here as footnotes at the conclusion of each day begg s matter of fact writing contrasts
 sharply with williams more dramatic account the latter of course being written for the entertainment of globe readers williams narrative
 begins at calgary where he met bcgg after an uneventful trip from fort macleod hugh a dempsey calgary oct 4

 i noticed what appeared weather to come tonight i sat outside the to be a curious collection of boulders upon

 about a little before noon we reached a clump fifteen miles from the ford where we have of grey willows

 party of friends in beautiful that had felt a wintry frost and the dark weather and where one can run

 cheek from travelling through an almost unin the cold cutting breath of a blinding snowhabited country with a solitary half
 breed storm from the north attendant a small tent a waggon a little in time we reached the ford and

 consciousness that we had no difficulty in crossing as the over a thousand miles of this lonesome water scarcely came
 up to the ponies travelling still lies between me and civili girths zation though the season is already far advanced
 and bad weather and bad roads after camping for noon on the bottoms are only what may reasonably be expected
 beyond the ford we drove on to blind man s river and crossing a narrow but deep and as i
 close my journal i can hear the rocky ford we reached our present camp 1 winds moaning and howling over
 the hills the strip of land some ten miles wide lyabove us and between the fitful gusts come ing between

 howling ever may be the character of the country outside and the snow was banked up about further towards its
 source it is very certhe tent on every side after consulting tam that the valley of this stream where with
 peter i decided that it would be bet it is crossed by the calgary and edmonton ter to try and
 push on as my supplies were trail is quite unsuitable for the purpose not sufficiently extensive to make it safe
 the region is i think a cold one in which to remain longer in our camp than was the snows

 while as often out the storm was still raging but to reas a storm gust sweeps down upon us a

 would not admit laden branches falls hissing upon our bright of any unnecessary delay so we decided crackling camp fire
 the ponies have quit to push on as rapidly as possible during feeding and are huddled together in a little

 i have no grain to give thickened and the storm continued as fiercethem as i was only able to secure
 a very ly as ever the country was good as far as limited supply at calgary which was ex battle

 to tion is a serious one some of my ponies travelling with kyuses overtook me are now almost unfit for
 service and even the best of them are shrinking terribly from jim and blanche were afraid of the ford hard
 work and lack of feed my rations and i rode on breaking the ice at the edge are rather light
 and i am not at all sure of the river and riding through ahead of that they will last till
 i get to edmonton them punch and little olivette following if the roads continue as bad as they are without
 any hesitation then came the team or become worse as i begin to fear they and the waggon but sandy
 declined to folmay i shall be in a miserable plight by low preferring to look out a crossing for the
 time i reach edmonton 12 himself thinking he would come along when he got ready i rode on and left
 him fifteen mile coulee 138 miles from but by the time we had gone a quarter of calgary en route
 to edmonton oct a mile from the ford i decided to ride back again our camp was made in a
 raging and see what had become of the loiterer snow storm and still the storm gusts are seeing nothing of

 the snow has been falling all day a mile up stream when i found master and the travelling has been
 so heavy that sandy feeding quietly on the bank i drove we have only made fifteen miles the snow him
 back to the ford and managed to get collects in great masses in the ponies feet him to the water
 s edge without much difand the mud and snow gather in great ficulty but just as i was expecting to
 see ridges on the waggon wheels so that any him take the water he bolted off and clamthing but the
 slowest progress is impossible bering up the steep bank he ran off again to day we have been travelling through
 a i wheeled the stallion about and gave chase beautiful rolling prairie fairly wooded and over the rough ground at
 full gallop but considerably overgrown with brush about he ran nearly half a mile down stream betwo feet high it
 has the appearance of fore i was able to head him off and then good agricultural land but the grass
 is far i was only able to accomplish it by dashing from being clean enough for cattle ranch ing poplar

 muskegs and through tangled clumps of grey willows that tore and scratched my face as i swept through them again
 and again i brought the brute to the ford but as often he would break away and go racing up
 or down the stream once or twice he took the back trail for calgary but as this was in comparatively
 open country i could make the stallion head him off without much difficulty at last however the horse i was
 riding became tired and i re crossed the ford and was going on to camp for a fresh one when
 i met peter who alarmed at my long absence was already on the way with another horse between the two
 of us we managed to catch the runaway and bring him along to camp after crossing battle river 4 i
 found that the country deteriorated considerably in character and during nearly the whole of this afternoon we have been travelling
 through half frozen muskegs and swamps where the horses are continually breaking ice and ploughing through mud and water that
 often comes up to their girths indeed this whole region appears to be one vast swamp with here and there
 a narrow ridge of good land traversing from east to west in the middle of the afternoon sandy gave out
 and i had to have jim and blanche reharnessed to finish the day s drive this is the first time
 one of my ponies has play ed out and i cannot but regard it as an ill omen when i
 think of the long severe journey that lies before me just before dark we reached the bear hills indian village
 5 which is governed by three cree chiefs who are said to be brothers their names are sampson bobtail and
 ermine skin mc some of the people live in little log huts and some in tepees we drove up to
 the best looking of the log huts which is occupied by ermine skin and his son in law and asked
 permission ermjneskjn above was the host to williams to spread our blankets there for the night and begg during their
 1881 journey the a privilege that was cheerfully accorded to photo was taken at hobbema in the 1920 s us

 a cupful of tea out of his rationblack hair which when thus turned loose bag and gave it to the
 lady of the house hung down to his waist then after stand and a few minutes later i was informed
 ing his single barrelled hudson s bay gun that they purposed having a tea dance if i in a corner
 by the fireplace he dropped had no objection of course i had no oba partridge from under his blanket his
 jection and accordingly a large sheet iron wife and the children appeared particularly kettle was brought in from out of
 doors pleased at this and as the latter were about filled with water and hung over the fire in due
 time the tea was made but long i hope to reach the indian instructor s before this our host s
 grandmother had farm which is some twenty miles farther come in from a neighbouring tepee and was along the trail
 17 duly installed as mistress of ceremonies as in camp indian farm bear hills 173 soon as the kettle had
 been lifted off the miles from calgary en route to edmonton fire this energetic old lady commenced to october 11
 this morning the weather extend the invitations to the dance but of was as cold and stormy as ever and
 my course she did not waste any perfumed ponies had wandered off in search of better stationery or fancy printing
 in the task as forage so that it was eleven o clock before signed her though her manner of perform
 we were on our way again we have made ing it was unique and original she merely twenty miles to
 day over the worst trail went outside the hovel and shouted in cree we have yet found the country appears
 the names of the invited guests the nature to be one vast swamp with only here and of the party
 to which they were being in there a narrow ridge of low upland running vited and that the liquor was
 ready through it judging from luxuriant growth in a few minutes the shanty was half of coarse grass and small
 shrubbery mostfilled with squaws young and old who ly grey willow i should suppose the land squatted upon the floor
 and began drinking to be very rich and productive but i canthe tea and laughing and jabbering cree not quite
 understand how such an immense in the most energetic manner when they swamp can be made useful for many years
 had drunk about two cups each the old to come unless something gigantic in the mistress of ceremonies got up
 and after way of drainage can be devised and put bowing very profoundly to johnny peter into effect for its
 benefit and myself began to sing and dance in the i had heard some pretty strong stories usual indian fashion
 the dancing and sing about the character of the trails approaching were very much like all other indian ing edmonton
 but the half had not been dances that i have seen except that there told there may be good land
 about edwere no male singers or dancers they had monton but if the other approaches to it a tea dance
 a buffalo dance in which are as bad as this one any intending settler the women wore different articles of
 er would do well to consider the matter caremine skin s hunting accoutrements and fully before attempting to make his
 way then there was a gift dance in which the through these frightful morasses as long as old mistress of
 ceremonies said she was there is plenty of good land easy of access giving her grandson a horse of course
 this throughout the whole of this vast territory was pure fiction but such things are very to day the trail

 there were evidently large quantities of it the majority of it could not be separated economically from the black sand
 that held the gold tightly in its grasp however such a trifling matter did not deter the edmonton bulletin nor
 the edmonton board of trade from publicizing the fact that gold was to be found in the flats bars and
 benches of the north saskatchewan from about 100 miles above edmonton to 50 to 100 mniles downriver as well as
 in the other large rivers which cut across the area of the north west territory soon to become the province
