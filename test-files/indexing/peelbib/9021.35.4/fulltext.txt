 world ‘ s greatest bucking horse by john 0 mchugh before telling about fox i must explain washed gravel to
 builders in calgary so he had about the setup of our ranching interests my quite a number of teams of
 horses hauling from father felix a mchugh founded the h 2 ranch the bow river to the various construction jobs
 and first went into partnership with his younger around town as 1912 was a good year in the brother thomas
 patrick mchugh and then with building trade the demand for gravel increased john joseph mchugh the second oldest thomas and
 frank was obliged to put more teams to work later withdrew from the partnership by making a so he arranged
 with his uncle tom for the use division of stock and started his own ranch at of some of his
 horses among which was fox he queenstown so the foundation stock of the h 2 was not quite as heavy
 as the other horses but he ranch and of the quarter cimle t ranch which was strong and willing and
 was put in a snatch was my uncle tom s horse brand was the team the work of the snatch
 team was to act same i fox was a quarter circle t sorrel horse who the author a pioneer albertan
 prepared this article was bred and born on the open range about 1902 for the glenbow archives in 1960 as
 part of a he was just one of the hor ses until he was broken rnanuscnpt the adventures of h

 about 1911 frank mchugh ranch just before he was sold in 1919 a son of john j was engaged in
 supplying river l as an auxiliary team to help haul the gravel wagon ride the camp champion came forward inspected
 from the river bottom up the bank one team of his equipment and when all was in readiness for horses
 could handle the load from there on the the test he mounted the horse when the blind snatch team would
 work hard for three or four fold was jerked off the sorrel went right to work minutes and then would
 be left standing around and on the third jump the camp champion rider until the next load was r eady
 went flying through the air in a spread eagle frank mchugh owned a large log stable on the fashion the
 next day the calgary daily herald south east corner of seventeenth avenue and printed a story about the angel faced
 mchugh centre street just across the street from the boys producing a horse the soldier boys in camp sherman rink
 he had quite a number of teamsters could not ride so when sunday came around these men would after the
 summer fox was returned to his old be looking after their horses and by the afternoon range where he spent
 the winter rustling for himthey would be spoiling for something to do there self on the luxurious grass on the
 northern edge was a plank corral on the south west corner of this of the buffalo hills i often saw
 him enjoying this property and as some of the teamsters were ex winter pasture and in the spring i helped
 to gather perienced riders they asked frank if they could him in on the horse roundup when he was t
 y out some of the work horses for bucking pos brought in off the open range with a big fat
 grass sibilities he suggested they take the snatch belly some of the h 2 riders who had heard of team
 as they did not work as hard as the others his reputation thought they would take advantage so having gained
 permission the men led the of his condition and have an easy ride they took team to the corral and
 saddled one of them a him to the corrals at the ranch but even in this rider mounted and a
 good exhibition of bucking condition fox proved too much horse for these followed would be riders then one of the
 men threw the saddle on fox fox was then groomed and fed oats so that he and almost as soon
 as he mounted he was bucked would be in good shape for the coming bucking off this caused a lot
 of excitement as this man horse contests in these contests his reputation was considered to be a rider of proven
 ability spread until it was recognized that he had no equal other men then tried to ride this horse but
 could in the district he won many championships not stay with him either right ther e the sorrel throughout the
 country and my brother walter horse s reputation started and on the following even took him to new york in
 1916 for the wild sunday the same thing happened the sorrel threw west doings there by this time his name
 was all the men that got on his back then he was fa mous as a bucking horse so when
 the newspaper taken to a bucking contest and performed beauti reporters came around asking questions about the fully throwing everyone
 who attempted to ride horses my brother walter asked the men in the him stalls not to mention his name
 so as not to frighten in the summer of 1912 a militia army camp away the good riders when each
 man was asked was held on the hill in south west calgar y there fox s name he replied i
 don t know the was a quite number of ranchers sons attending reporters gave him that name in their papers
 and and on sundays they would put on exhibitions of he bucked in new york under the name i don
 t bronco riding until they could select a champion know bucking horse rider for the camp some of the in
 1919 fox was sold to the pendleton roundboys were boasting about their riding abilities and up association and given the
 new title of no the chinook wind blowing from that direction name more than likely the pendleton roundup scattered these
 boasts all over town by this time association wanted to disguise his name and repu fox was beginning to build
 up a reputation as a tation to spring a surprise on everybody and to good hard bucking horse that no
 man could ride bring the horse in as an unknown so a couple of my brothers took him off the
 gravel for the rest of fox career i can do no better hauling team and out to the militia camp

 prostitutes and tion for the purpose of sexual intercourse prostibrothels were highly visible throughout the west tution incest rape carnal
 knowledge sodomy during those years it should be of no surprise that bestiality and indecent assault it is evident that
 attention centred on the impact of prostitution and the term sex crime was not designed to be cxred light districts

 specific sex crimes have been in general a nd western canadians in particular were selected to form the basis for
 discussion rape atgreatly concerned with all types of sexual matters tempted rape carnal knowledge and attempted it is readily apparent
 that a visit to a prostitute was carnal knowledge these sex crimes were chosen not he only sexual activity indulged
 in by the male because the attitudes and actions surrounding these population of the west nor was it the only
 sexual offences are wrought with glaring similarities acencounter classified as socially unacceptable and cordingly much can be learned about societal
 crimina lly reprehensible in terms of the written law values of the time when the maze of laws that surround
 sex and the geographica l area chosen is the west which sexua l behavior in canada from 1890 to 1920
 are for the purposes of this discussion refers to the examined the only possible conclusion to draw is area known
 until 1905 as the north west territohat sex was not legal except in very limited and ries and the province
 of british columbia after strictly defined circumstances for example the the year 1905 it refers to british columbia and law
 stipulated that sex could only occur between the newly created provinces of saskatchewan and a man and a woman of
 a certain age who were alberta the years for the study have been limited legally married to each other concerted
 efforts to the thirty year time span from 1890 to 1920 were made to prohibit sex encounters between a period
 which was crucial to the general developmales through buggery and sodomy legislation ment of western canada and the growth of

 abortion and even the in order to understand how the criminal justice solemnization of marriage were all strictly con system
 processed charges of rape attempted rape trolled by specific sections of the criminal code carnal knowledge a nd attempted camal
 knowledge women were expected to remain chaste before they it is necessary to know what the written law of the
 married and evidently all sexual activity was to be day said about these crimes according to section confined to he
 marriage bed solely for the pur 266 of the 1892 criminal code rape was poses of procreation therefore all other
 sexual activity was deemed to be socially r epr ehensible and punishable as a crime under the written law the
 author is a teacher in the department of hisof the day tory at medicine hat college she is the author
 of usually when one hear s the term sex crime several papers relating to the sexual status of women one
 tends to think of the more serious type of sex in western canadian history 6 sometimes it was an issue
 the cases selected for consideration are limited to charges laid under sections 266 268 269 and 270 of the criminal
 cede of canada thus the i number of cases selected to form the basis for this study are approximately one
 hundred and twentyfive this number includes the pr ecedent setting cases which can be found in the published law reports
 in addition cases processed through he various supreme and district courts of the north west territories and alberta accounts of
 cases found in the mounted police and provincial police reports and any pertinent information obtained from a wide variety of
 available unpublished court lj records have been included i when exa mining the court cases dealing with rape and to
 a lesser extent carnal knowledge one is immediately struck by the number of instances justice is seen here seeking the
 equality of men and women in which the issue of consent was central to the in this calgary eye opener
 cartoon of march 18 1916 discussion despite the fact that section 266 of the in reality the equal balance was
 only an illusion criminal code stipulated that rape was carnal the act of a man having camal knowledge of a
 knowledge without the consent or consent obtained woman who is not his wife without her consent or with her consent
 which has been extorted by threats through threats fear of bodily harm personating or fear of bodily harm or obtained
 by personating the he husband and even taldng advantage of the menwoman s husband or by false and fraudulent represen
 tally handicapped it seemed the enforcers of the tation as to the nature and quality of the act law did
 not adhere to this definition instead heir included in canada s rape laws at the time was actions suggest that
 they were more in tune to the the 1841 stipulation that there was no need for the eighteenth century english
 common law definition pr oof of emission of seed or complete penetration of the crime quite simply rape was considered
 to constitute carna l knowledge in addition such to be the act of a man having unlawful carnal an offence
 was classified as an indictable one and knowledge of a woman by force and against her if found guilty the
 culprit was liable to the death will 6 unfortunately however this much shorter pena lty or life imprisonment definition of
 rape is wrought with problems as to section 268 of the criminal code dealt with the what constituted consent how
 does one measure crime of attempted rape also classified as an in force how much resistance indicates against her dictable
 offence a conviction carried the possibil wifi hen does ‘ no really mean ‘ no and lastly ity of seven
 years imprisonment 2 in 1920 the was the woman telling the truth or in other words criminal code was amended
 to include a stipula there is need for corroborative evidence tion that if convicted of either rape or attempted the
 best way for members of the justice system rape an additional penalty of a whipping could be to measure consent
 or mor e precisely the lack of handed out by the presiding judge 3 consent was through some sign of
 resistance to according to section 269 of the 1892 criminal the attack in fact the more physical the display code
 a person was of resistance the more likely he woman was to guilty of an indictable offence and liable to
 imprison be believed a woman had to show that a verbal ment for life and to be whipped who carnally
 knows ‘ no was accompanied by a physical display of any girl under the age of fourteen years not being
 ‘ no for example in september 1897 the viehis wife whether he believes her to be of or above that
 age or not 4 toria daily colonist felt that mrs thomas rab if convicted for attempted carnal knowledge of bitt
 should be acquitted for murdering her assailant a girl under fourteen section 270 stipulated that the facts of the case
 indicate that she was defendthe person could receive a maximum two year term ing herself from an attempted rape therefore
 the of imprisonment and a flogging 5 it should be paper suggested that her action was justifiable noted that the
 legal definition of carnal knowledge homicide 7 in another case inspector wilson of does not mention the matter of consent
 or non the north west mounted police at regina noted consent as being a prerequisite to the charge yet in
 his annual report for the year ending 1901 that a rape had been attempted on a girl within two ception
 of the sexual parts of the latter area the miles of qu appelle apparently he girl had been doctor noted
 the lower part of the entrance to the riding her bicycle in broad daylight when she was vagina was lacerated
 this showed that some attacked wilson noted that the girl had kicked and force had been used to cause this
 scratched her assailant until help had arrived 8 interestingly grazely s statement contradicts the obviously in such instances as the
 rabbitt case and girl s story while at the sa me time reinforces the he one cited by wilson the
 display of physical doctor s testimony according to the accused he resistance to the assault had been successful in not
 had been at his homestead on july 30 th when may only repulsing the would be assailant but also in
 culling came over to see him and threw herself lending credibility to the females claims that they on the bed
 then in the words of grazely i had in fact been sexually attacked knew what this girl was looking for
 i asked serious doubts were raised when there was no her to let me have a piece which she consented
 evidence or what was thought to be insufficient to providing i would not tell her folks i used evidence of
 physica l resistance while a number no force whatsoever except my privates when of rape cases could serve well as
 examples only he case finally went to trial grazely pleaded not seven have been selected in an attempt to prove
 guilty to a charge of rape subsequently a jury continuity of the trend to demand physical returned a verdict of
 not guilty due to the apparent r esistance he seven cases chosen transcend the en lack of physical resistance surrounding
 the tire time period and were selected from the years assault 1906 1908 1913 2 cases 1915 1918 and 1919
 the first case involves a charge of rape laid the third and fourth cases selected come from against george bryan
 on november 27 1906 in january and june 1913 in the earlier instance a her testimoney to the supreme court
 of the north married woman told a preliminary hearing at west territories and alberta which was sitting in brooks on
 january 9 1913 hat she had consented ca lgary the complainant twenty three year old to sexual intercourse with the
 accused on decem agnes marshal stated hat despite her pleading ber 28 1912 she had done so because he had
 shouting and crying bryan had raped her look hreatened to kill both her and her husband if one ing for
 a possible statement of consent or non refers back to section 266 of the criminal code consent the defence lawyer
 asked agnes if she had consent to intercourse obtained through fear and cried out loud enough so the neighbours who
 lived threats of bodily harm was supposedly a key cornclose by might hear her agnes response was no ponent in
 a charge of rape but evidently such was then the lawyer obviously searching for some dis not he case in
 this particular instance despite the play of physical resistance asked her if she had fact that this case was sent
 to trial the jury found tried to fight kick scratch or get away from the the accused not guilty since
 there was no display accused once again the response was no as a of physical resistance only the woman insistence
 result of the woman s testimony bryan was found that she feared for her and her husband s life 2
 not guilty of rape due to a lack of evidence of phys the second case which occurred in 1913 is
 ical resistance on the part of the complainant 9 somewhat similar to the bryan and grazely cases the second case
 involves the alleged rape of a on june 13 1913 alva garrett was charged with sixteen year old girl may
 culling by perle graze raping a fourteen year old girl whom he had known ly on july 30 1908 at
 dog pound alberta the for approximately two years the judge who tried girl told a preliminaiy inquiry at the july
 31 1908 he case in mid october of the same year found sitting of the supreme court of the north
 west ter the accused not guilty of rape as he concluded there ntories and alberta in calgary that on the
 even was insufficient evidence of a struggle although ing of july 30 th between he hours of five and the
 girl alleged that she had screamed and tried to six o clock she had been picking gooseberries get away much
 was made of the fact that her when gra zely arrived on the scene he immedi clothes were not torn
 and no one heart her screams ately threw her on the ground and raped her may it is readily apparent
 the judge was not convinced further testified she had repeatedly pleaded with by the girl s assertion that they had
 gone on a bughe accused to stop and when she tried to get up gy ride out to the middle
 of nowhere 3 in fact it grazely held her down by force the doctor who would have been a stroke
 of luck if anyone had examined may the same evening the alleged at heard her screams yet the judge s
 verdict of not tack took place told the court that he had found guilty seems to suggest a nagging belief
 that if the no bruises or marks on the body with the cx girl had screamed loud enough she would
 have 8 been heard obviously then she did not scream loud enough the trend continues in a 1915 case on
 april 26 th of that year cv van scoy was charged with raping an eighteen year old domestic servant girl
 in late august 1914 at strathmore at the preliminar y inquiry the girl told the court that she had become
 pregnant as a result of the rape in crossexamination when she stated she had consented out of fear the defence
 lawyer argued it was not a sufficient reason then when she testified that she a had not tried to scratch
 or bite the accused because ‘ 1 she did not get the opportunity counsel for the accused charged it would
 save your self respect a whole lot to tell him her father that you were raped rather than just a
 matter of having connection although sufficient evidence was found to commit the accused to trial van scoy was found not
 guilty by a jury due to a lack of physical resistance 4 ‘ a similar verdict was registered in the
 sixth case on november 10 1918 jessie thompson of crossfield told the court that the accused guy neetnay had r
 aped her despite her pr otests nd her attempts to get away when asked whether she had tried to fight
 off her assailant thompson r eplied she had not been strong enough and hus he had had intercourse with her
 she also told the court the evidence had to be o er helnting for a man to be convicted of

 court she did not understand the question on june 7 1913 at the mounted police bar the magistrate then rephrased
 the question to the racks near greenshields alberta paul chattier was following did you permit him mcmahaml to charged wit

 too young to appear before he accused kissed her or when he asked her to kiss the hearing her deposition

 court in saskatchewan he accused waledek told the court that although the woman in the eyes of the enforcers of

 part of a female was the while there are several illustrative cases for this loss of her life indeed this

 any doubts about highlighted the issue of consent which might have arisen at the general tone for the time period
 was nicely he trial if rape or carnal knowledge was a fate set by judge richardson in 1890 in that
 year worse tha n death then some women chose death richardson handed out a three year prison term to for
 example on september 17 1889 the regina a man convicted of the first recorded attempted rape leader told of a
 woman in the city who had been on a half breed woman in the north west ternraped earlier in the
 month she had struggled so tories referring to the attack as the meanest of much that she had subsequently died
 as a result offences richardson told the six man jury that of attempting to defend herself 23 so long as
 a woman be she white or black and in a sensationalized front page coverage of conducted herself properly she was
 entitled an alleged rape murder of a twenty two year old to protection as the highest lady of the land
 28 british columbia woman in south wellington in unfortunately by making such a statement july 1906 the nanaimo free press
 characterized richardson opened up he question as to what conthe attacker as having he instincts of a heart black stituted
 proper conduct in order to answer this with inky sin because he had tried to rob a fair the courts
 subjected women to a barrage of attacks woman of her honour which was treasured on their moral character this trial
 within a trial above life itself 24 since he had been unsuccess was so severe that at times the woman
 became the ful in his rape attempt he had killed the woman defendant and the accused the prosecutor for ex
 speaking of the girl s valiant but fateful struggle ample a sixteen year old girl s credibility in one he
 newspaper noted she had died defending all rape case was virtually destr oyed by the defence hat is dearest and
 best to womanhood her attorney he suggested that the girl had had interhonour 25 the calgary morning albertan of july
 course on a previous occasion with a man with 25 1906 reported the case in a similar fashion whom she
 had gone dancing the defence argued when it observed that the girl had died defend that if she had consented
 at that time then obviing her honour on her wrists were the cruel marks ously she would be more inclined
 to consent to inof violence and other signs denoted all too clear tercourse with the accused on january 24 th
 1913 ly the tragic tale man s brutality and a worn it is interesting to note that neither the judge
 nor 11 the prosecuting attorney objected to this line of the need for corroborative evidence took over and defence 29
 became of more concern but in rape cases the a hird case involved a charge of attempted rape hue and
 cry was a crucial element as the folon september 17 1917 the defence lawyer tried lowing four cases indicate to
 create the impression that the woman had not in his annual report for the year ending 1897 conducted her self
 properly and thus her claim sergeant hynes of the north west mounted police of attempted rape was somewhat questionable stationed
 at estevan told of an interesting rape case during cross examination she stated that she had in his district according
 to a woman who had gone been married but had left her husband because he to a circus in oxbow
 one of the showmen had had not supported her in addition she admitted dragged her under a tent and raped
 her although to having a sexual relationship with another man there had been four police officers including n inprior to
 her marriage but they had made a pact say spector on duty at the fair grounds she did not ing
 that nothing had gone on between them such make a complaint nor did she complain until it beconduct was neit
 her proper nor morally right thus came obvious that she was pregnant the sergeant three months later on december 19
 th 1917 the indicated that even if the showman was guilty it crown entered a stay of proceedings 3 the
 last would be impossible to apprehend him because of example involved a charge of rape on january 2 the long
 time delay furthermore he felt the girl 1918 at hardisty where the prosecuting attorney had la id a compla int
 of rape as a cover up to cloak asked the sixteen year old girl whet her this was the her
 real seducer ‘ b first time that she had had sexua l relations 3 thus a similar set of circumstances
 appear in a febniit is evident that both the prosecution and the ary 16 th 1899 report of a rape
 in regina the defence expected the woman to be of high moral rape had a llegedly occurred in 1897 but
 no corncharacter possess an impeccable reputation and pla int had been made until the following year when conduct herself properly
 before they would be the woman the accused s half niece gave birth lieve her claim of being sexually attacked
 to a child the woman s testimony lost complete if the issues of consent the physical display of credibility because
 she had first claimed that she resistance and a woman s mora l character were had been raped by a
 stranger who had pulled her of importance in a rape charge the cases also from her horse while she had
 been riding in town reveal a genuine concern with the length of time based upon such evidence the accused was
 found which elapsed tetween the attack and when the not guilty b complaint was made this fact was considered to
 more similarities can be seen in the george sinki be extremely important because it was yet another and william thompson
 cases of 1915 in the sinki way to measure consent and the moral character case heard at wetaskiwin in may
 the defence lawof the woman for example it was generally as yer objected to the woman s information being adsumed
 that a woma n of good moral character mitted as evidence of a complaint as it was not would be
 more likely to tell someone immediate given until several mont hs after the alleged act had ly after the attack
 than a woman who had consented taken place much like the two previously mento intercourse it seems evident that the
 justice sys tioned cases the girl said she had been raped only tern in the west whether it realized it
 or not was after her pregnancy had become noticeable then adhering to the guidelines established by henr y de she
 stated that the accused had raped her at her bracton in the thirteenth century according to grandmother s house yet
 her grandmother told the bracton the raped women must go at once and court that the girl never mentioned he
 rape to while the deed is newly done with the hue and her 35 and in the thompson case at
 didsbur y the the cr y to he neighbouring townships and there girl s father a lleged that the accused
 had raped his show the injury done to her to men of good re eighteen year old daughter on or
 about february pute 32 interestingly the question of raising he 19 th 1915 however the complaint was not hue and
 cry as it became known was not of registered until june 29 th of that year upon cxmuch importance in
 cases involving carnal amination a doctor found the girl to be four andknowledge and attempted carnal knowledge of a a
 half months pregnant since the complaint had girl under fourteen in other words it did not matter not been given
 at the first reasonable opportunity when the girl told someone of the alleged assault the jury found the accused not
 guilty 36 just the fact that she had told someone was impor in addition to the courts in the west
 expecting tant for the charge to be laid then other matters the complaint to be made at the first reasonable
 such as whether the child was telling the truth and opportunity there is evidence to suggest that the 12 the
 calgary court house seen here in 1904 was the scene of numerous hearings and trials relating to rape and attempted
 rape complaint had to be made voluntarily that is them the supreme court of saskatchewan ruled in favour should be
 no leading questions to the woman this of the accused jim dunning and ordered that a new is clearly reflected
 in two noteworthy cases on trial be held on the grounds as to whether the corn october 26 th 1906
 the fa ll sitting of the court of plaint had been laid at the first reasonable oppor assi zes at
 new westminster heard the jimmy tunity the evidence presented in this case mdi spuzzum rape case the crown had called
 as one cates that the woman jenny cole made her first of its witnesses he girl s aunt who after
 hearing complaint about a rape after a friend asked her a various stories had gone to see he girl at
 her home direct question as to whether the accused had been he day after the alleged rape according to he
 girl getting too free with her after listening to jenhe accused spuzzum had broken into the house fly the friend
 then went to get jenny husband on a night that her father was away and had raped and told him
 what had happened he testified that her the next morning she had gone to her aunt s he had met
 her his wife outside the shack and house and told her nine year old cousin that the threw my arms
 around her neck and kissed her and house had been burglarized she did not mention then took her to the
 shack i asked her if dunning the rape upon receiving this infonnation he aunt had hurt her jenny s answer
 to her husband s went to see the girl and asked her the following question was considered to be the
 second comquestion what was the trouble at that point plaint however the court of appeal ruled that the the girl
 told he aunt what had happened includ trial judge should not have admitted as evidence ing he rape council for
 the defence argued that of a complaint he information obtained from the he girl s answer was mere conversation and
 thus leading questions of the friend and the woman s objected to it being admitted as evidence of a com
 husband it was argued that the questions suggested plaint furthermore he stated it was inadmissable dunning was guilty 38 thus
 what was at issue in since it had not been given at the first reasonable this particular case was not
 whether or not a rape opportunity or without prompting from the aunt had occurred but whether or not the woman
 had however the trial judge used his discretionary given her complaint voluntarily and at the first powers and as a
 result he evidence was admit reasonable opportunity ted much to the chagrin of the defence lawyer the second case displays
 similar circumstances given that a woman s testimony in a rape case to the spuzzum episode on march 31 st
 1908 was viewed with a jaundiced eye the justice sys 13 tern in the west seemed to demand corroborative to
 admit the unsworn testimony taken from a girl evidence to reinforce the woman s claim that she of tender years
 and the need for sufficient corhad in fact been raped for example in his annu roborative evidence only three cases
 have been al report for the year ending 1901 superintendent chosen to illustrate this trend in the first case hen
 joseph howe of the north west mounted police ry chapman was arrested in medicine hat for the noted that two
 rapes in his district had been tried attempted carnal knowledge of a six year old girl and dismissed due to
 a lack of corroborative cvi in the fall of 1897 however when he was br ought dence 39 and in
 a case reported five years later on to trial on november 4 th he child s statement was august 28

 charged with raping a woman evidence chapman was acquitted 45 similarly named ellen castle however the next day the judge
 rouleau dismissed a charge of carnal crown decided not to proceed with the case at that knowledge committed on an
 eight year old girl in time as the woman was the only witness present lethbridge in 1901 although he firmly
 believed for the prosecution her father and other witnesses that the man was guilty rouleau thought here was were absent
 obviously it was felt that the wo insufficient evidence to warrant taking the case to man s statement was not
 sufficient in a court of trial law and consequently the hearing was adjourned and in an april 1919 case of
 attempted carnal until september 4 th l 906 more proof was knowledge on a ten year old and a nine
 year old needed for a woman s claim of ‘ no han was need girl heard in wetaskiwin n official

 their statements under oath the letter dated corroborative evidence was needed to ascertain april 29 th 1919 contained he following
 statewhether the child was in fact telling the truth ment while them seems very little doubt that the repeatedly the

 was not whether the crime had taken place a nine year old girl whether she had ever attended but whether
 the child s stor y could be supported sunday school knew the difference between right what then constituted corroboration for

 had the a medical doctor evidence taken from a plethor a girl kiss the bible as indication that while she
 might of cases suggested that the courts were more likenot understand the nature of the oath what she was ly

 had had a sexual relationship with female 44 the accused for well over a year but she had not the
 evidence suggests that several cases of car told anyone the doctor told the court that upon nal knowledge and attempted
 carnal knowledge examination he found the girl s vagina bigger than were dismissed or verdicts of not guilty were it
 should be and the hymen ruptured however registered due to the problems of whether or not he noted i cannot
 state positively whether the 14 rupture of the hymen was caused by sexual inter understand what if anything had gone
 on the course given the doctor s testimony and the fact facts of the case are as follows a four
 year old girl that the girl was not pregnant the accused was not under oath told the court that the
 accused had found not guilty on october 13 th 1913 put himself inside her attempting to corroborate three years later
 in a somewhat similar case her stor y the doctor who examined the girl testi james dora appeared before the
 calgary division fled that her hymen was ruptured her sex organs of the supreme court of alberta for having carnal
 were swollen there was a discharge of pus and knowledge of annie bernard a nine year old girl here was
 blood in her urine thus he concluded on april 1 st 1916 after the police magistrate had she had been
 violated by sexual inter course and impressed upon the girl the importance of telling penetration made by he male organ
 but the docthe truth she stated that the accused had penetrated tor s testimony was not enough and the accused
 her on at least two occasions the doctor who cx was found not guilty 5 amined annie told the court
 that she was bruised it is obvious that the best type of medical cviand there had been an attempt made
 to penetrate dence to have was not necessarily proof of penetrathe child with some kind of blunt instrument he tio

 that was all 49 once again the accused was began in calgary the girl told the court that the found
 not guilty perhaps if the girls in the dora accused had put his hands under my dr awers and mcnary
 cases had been pregnant he courts andi put his pecker up against me subsemight have been more inclined to believe
 that quently she was examined by two doctors who penetration had taken place both appeared before the judge and jury
 the first in a rather peculiar case tried in may 1914 all doctor stated that he found the girl s
 sex organs the medical evidence indicated that carnal knowl red and the vulva slightly stretched however there edge had taken

 girl who had been cond doctor concurred with the finding of his colassaulted did not possess sufficient intelligence to league

 the norm for the trial to turn into an examination was meted out for infecting the child with a of
 the female s moral character and her sex life venereal disease since there was no evidence of instead of the
 alleged act committed against her actua l carnal knowledge having taken place similar problems can be found in those cases

 evident that the system cx ual behaviour greatly influenced the handling of ercised the prerogative of mercy in a few
 cases sex cases by the criminal justice system in the where prisoners were conditionally and uncondi west it was generally

 questions to be asked was bands afterwards this concept was revealed and whether or not the enforcers of the criminal
 justice reinforced in the social perceptions of the institusystem in the west condoned sex crimes against tion of marriage women
 were to marry not for women there can be little doubt that the answer love but to pr oduce care
 for and raise children to this question is yes indeed his is supported in fact once married sex was to
 be endur ed not by an analysis of the sex crimes chosen for this enjoyed supposedly enjoyment would come from

 the cnmial justice system in the age that every able bodied man wanted to seduce west in these cases did
 not fulfill the law s promise them 53 women came to view sex as the seamier to help the women

 one sometimes hears a resident of manitoba or the territories blame this or that for his want of success but
 never a word about himself of all human grumbling this seems the most peculiar and barren of results meeting no
 sympathy and wasting precious time sensible men know that every country has some drawbacks and only ask to know them
 so they may plan in harmony when a man comes willingly to a country eats its bread accepts its protection
 and uses its appliances common courtesy should seal his lips and i f unsuccessful common justice should induce him to
 examine the causes and place the blame where it belongs step up to the line gentlemen do one of two
 things either tell us all about yourself then let us tell all about the country and so enable readers to
 draw their own conclusions or tell both sides of the story when you are grumbling this country has nothing to
 fear fr om the truth and never had and any honest man who works can do well in it but
 it has received much injury from those entirely unfitted for it ignorant of their own wants and of how to
 supply them yet not morally brave enough to acknowledge the causes of their failure they burn the roof that sheltered
 them bite the hand that f ed them and spit in the face of those who gave them kindly welcome

 after it cured a prairie nine in the morning so we could sleep during the fire was a thing to
 be dreaded many a time our day if the mosquitoes gave us peace the sheep men folk were out all
 night fighting with sacks and would lie or stand in groups all during the heat of sheepkins it was quite
 common for cattlemen to the day and as it got cooler in the afternoon they kill a steer and drag

 eating meat corral of chicken wire for the hens with a box on just three days before my second baby
 was bom the one end and although there were only twelve i went to grassy lake to catch the train
 for leth of them it was enough to supply us with fresh eggs bridge the noon train service had just
 been in and we thought we were well catered for operation for a few weeks and it was a big
 im the first year we camped all oven the country provement from the night travelling we were west and south
 and the next year east and then standing on the platform of the grassy lake trad south and latterly north
 along the banks of chering co store when we saw the smoke of a prairie ry coulee fire a little
 east of our home we drove back as we were overtaken by a very bad snowstorm fast as the horses
 could take us still in the lumber in the early days of october 1908 when we were wagon and he
 men went off to fight he fire they quite unprepared for it it snowed for twenty four found a new
 herder had thrown out his ashes from hours and then it blew so hand you could not see the stove
 while they were still hot and the wind in front of you the sheep were getting snowed had fanned them
 till the flames caught the sun oven in the corral so we had to knock it down and rounding grass
 it was midnight when the men got let the free ones run and lift out those that were home again
 and next morning i had that same long buried it took us two days to gather them up again drive
 to take once more i got to lethbridge in the our supply of wood ran out and i had to
 burn afternoon and my baby was born the following the corral posts after they were gone i put the morning
 children to bed to keep them warm till the section during the first four years of my married life boss

 of the new arrivals they all seemed haped for home it took us four days just to get to bun
 py a nd why not our government was giving them dett fo ur miles because of the deep snow 160
 acres of free land when we got south of burdett we left the sheep the land east of us was
 then thnown open for with my brother in law and that finished my life homesteading and the country was filled
 with newin a camp wagon my other work was not finished comers in a short time shacks were built firehowever
 when winter came i had to drive the guards ploughed and the bald prairie soon became sleigh with he hay
 while my husband forked it out a thing of the past my little children three of them now had to
 be these new settlers felt the need of comradeship left in the house all alone and many a time my
 so get acquainted parties were held at each other s heart was in my mouth wondering if they were homes
 later on as the schools were built concerts touching the fires box socials and dances were held it was quite
 if a blizzard came up while my husband was common to hear a noise like a lot of coyotes howlaway
 for hay i had to carry a bundle of feed on ing and on investigation to find out that it
 was my back and go for the sheep so as to help the sever al sleigh loads of folks from
 all over the disherder get them home as soon as you threw out trict coming to spend the evening they
 brought little pieces of hay the sheep would follow even the edibles and all we had to provide was the
 tea in the face of a storm and coffee they did the work beds were taken one afternoon my husband
 went to help a new apart or piled on top of each other to make room for a ll who
 came elegance had no part in these herder with the sheep and had not gone long when it started to
 blow i waited for some time hen went gathenngs a good time was a ll we looked for out and
 filled the little jumper with hay the only one night when i was doctor ing my husba nd for a
 bad cold two sleigh loads of neighbour s drove horse left was an indian pony so i harnessed hen and
 hitched her to the sleigh when i got to the up to our home and took the place by storm
 jim was forced to get out of bed and look pleasant sheep my husband and the herder were about next
 concert this was the skit on him played out fighting to ma ke them move on so hey what s
 the matter with jim neil were glad to see me but they still had to laugh he s a sleepy
 head for i had put the harness on upside down when we go to visit him to give you some
 idea of the loneliness of the there he lies a bed prairie and seeing only men i will relate a
 little tho we arnve with bustle and din and rho jim hates to get up like sin incident that happened
 to me i had been alone all he gets up and puts on a grin day and in the afternoon
 i spied a rider making jim s all right for the camp wagon here s another horse thief one night
 in march 1909 during a snowstorm i thought so i locked the door and put a piece of a buggy
 of young people drove up to our house wood under the window to act as a snib hen lay after
 dark and asked to be directed to a farm south down at the very back of the bed of us
 my husband advised them to stay with us he came along knocked at the door and get as it was
 such a stormy night but they thought here ting no answer he tried to open it and then he came
 was no need for that about an hour later they round to the window he shook it several times came
 to our other door asking how to get out of and i was watching that little piece of wood fear
 the coulee and still they wer e determined to go ing it would give way but it stood the shaking
 on it was not long till they wer e back again and after a short time he went away not
 along after had to acknowledge defeat by now they wer e so i looked out and there he was coming
 back with chilled that they were glad to be indoor s instead my husba nd when they came up i
 was introduced of wandering on the prairie to him and he said he had been to the camp al a
 nurse mrs phipps was with me at the time r eady and had found no one at home i had
 to own and she made a bed for the girls on the sitting room up to the fact that i
 thought he was a horse thi ef couch while the young man sat on an easy chair so i had
 hidden at the back of the bed and acted as stoker for the night next morning when the first settlers
 arrived they came by way after breakfast they went back to grassy lake inof grassy lake and squatted 13 or
 16 miles south stead of trying to find their friends saying they had of the ranch around the westfield district
 it was learned a lesson about travelling out on the prairie quite exciting to see the loads of lumber and
 house in a snowstorm hold effects with a cow tied on behind tr acking sometimes funny little incidents happened to
 across the prairie i had many visitors and met give us a laugh once two women from near 24 grassy
 lake came to visit us during lambing time thought so i was thankful when i heard the noise while we
 were talking one of them remarked that of the wagon returning the ranch would be hard to find had we
 not used as jim drove up to the house in the darkness hat fine idea to direct people i said
 i did not know he called my name i m down here i answered what she mea nt and she
 said putting all the i m keeping the hree rams from running away sheep hoofs a long the trail and
 hen i caught on every rancher who came to visit us was told the our men had taken a hayrack
 with a load of sheep story and as they laughed i realized that as a sheep skins to ship from
 grassy lake and as they could hand i was very green not be shipped with the hoofs one of the
 men cut at first i seldom got away to town on even to them off as they drove along the
 trail and threw visit a neighbour there was always too much to hem out i had never noticed them before
 but i do and too few hands to do it much of my mendhad to smile next time i drove
 that way ing and making of clothes was done when every another time i was left behind while my hus
 one was in bed and it was then i made all the play ba nd went for a load of
 oats to feed the rams it toys for my children i had dogs cats elephants was he month of october
 and the rams were left and a lot of other animals made out of cloth and in a corral i
 was warned to keep them there and old stockings a nd stuffed with wool the children not let them get
 away and into any of the bands were delighted with them as they seldom saw other of sheep south of
 us or there would be trouble toys and when the neighbours childr en ca me to i was to let
 them out at five o clock and give them visit they too got a lot of fun out of our
 menagerie some oats in a trough in front of the corral at the if there was lumber to be got
 i would go to the appointed time i let them out and fed them but village riding on the running
 gear of the wagon when i tried to get hem to go back hree of them and then sit on
 the load coming home i even went refused to go into the corral i opened the gate like that when
 the baby was three months old i several times but they would always run past so had her sitting on
 my lap while i had a rope tied i stayed beside them with a whip in my hand and to
 the uprights of each side to act as a back for every time one of them moved i would crack
 the my seat by the time i arrived at grassy lake i whip hours passed darkness ca me and it
 seemed was wishing i had stayed at home so long waiting i did not dare leave them i we were
 lucky to have some very clever dogs ii crassy lake provided the closest train service for the neil family this

 wine for the women the mosquitoes had been very bad for several while the men had their jug of liquor

 several glasses before the mistake was noticed fused but when he got angry at her off she went we had
 the laugh on him for a long time when the men went out they found the sheep in when the
 trains came to grassy lake the a coulee seven miles away all bunched up so a mountie was generally on

 below the of his visit my husba nd showed me how to use house so the mm went there to
 feed when he the shotgun if the coyote showed up during he day needed a drink he would go to
 the well and wait so one day when i saw him coming i put a kitch till someone came along
 and filled the trough our en chair in front of the camp wagon door and rested well was eight feet
 square and was the only source the gun on it just as the coyote got opposite i of water in
 the district so he neighbours came for pulled the trigger i don t quite know what hap miles round for
 tanks of water someone wrote on pened next but i landed at the back of the bed while the top
 of he lid water the buck so the buck the coyote went merrily on his way i did not know
 got water by the end of the summer he was nice he gun would kick so much but time and
 ex and fat the hotel man from burdett came out to perience taught me a lot see if he could
 buy some mutton and seeing the we had a bunch of chickens and i was always mm he asked if
 he could buy it jim told him it missing one or two we suspected a coyote but was a mm
 but the man said that didn t matter so could never catch him till one day i saw him eat
 when jim was asked for five dollars he kicked a nd ing a dead la mb i did not have
 the gun at home sa id he would pay by the pound all right jim but i had a pistol
 i got it snea ked over to the foot said six cents a pound when the rum was of the
 hill and waited a few minutes then fired weighed the hotel man had to pay 7 20 but he first
 thing i saw was the coyote tumbling down was a good sport about it we did not eat at the
 the hill of course i thought he was after me iotel while he mm was on the menu i beat
 it to the house as fast as i could when the we also had a steer that we wanted rid
 of as he men came home i told them what had happened was a lways getting into he crops so
 he local butcher said he would take him he told his cusand hey said the coyote must must be lying
 tomers hat he had prime meat coming on satunwounded some place sure enough they found him not wounded but dead
 didn t i feel proud day so on hat day he sold all he had next week hat i was
 proving i oould do something as a sheep my husband was in town and several people told him he had
 sold a bum steer to the butcher they man s wife but i still have the notion that it was
 ca me to their own conclusions when told the steer not good guiding but pur e luck was still at
 the ranch whenever we had a dead horse we would put after my hird baby was born my husband traps
 out and sometimes we got quite a number bought some south african scrip and placed it on of coyotes and
 as there was a bounty on them the land adjoining our own pastures as we had it was worth the
 trouble besides we were ridding to comply with the conditions regulating that scrip the countr y of a bad enemy
 which was just like homestead laws we had to we never r aised pigs at the ranch but one time
 build a house on the land and live on it for six when my husba nd was at a sale
 he was helping months in each year for three years this meant to keep he prices up by bidding and
 got left with moving every six months which was no easy task seven pigs he sold some a nd kept
 one sow when our well for watering the stock was at t he home lambing time came we could not
 keep her in a pen ranch so we had to bring he horses in each morna nd every time she
 got out she would eat the head ing and harness them and hen take them to the off any young
 lambs she could catch the childen water had a pet lamb at that time and it began getting j went
 out every morning to help about 5 30 in he garden so hey were told to picket it or they
 one morning they were hard to put in the stable would have to get rid of it they put it
 down be so after i got one team in i tied them by the halter side the well where the
 grass was nice and green rope but unfortunately left it too slack the next but the old pig got out
 and as the lamb could not horse to go in ducked below the halter rope and 27 when the settlers
 began to arrive life was not so lonely for the author above is a threching crew at work near burdett
 about 1912 on tr ying to stop hen from coming out again she i asked mrs kirk if i could
 help in any way lowered her head and hit me on the abdomen arid she said if i could possibly
 take the two youngthrowing me about six feet as she straddled over est children home with me she could look
 after me she stepped on my left arm and broke it in two the rest i took three of them
 home one a girl of places eight and she was able to keep an eye on the other as the
 children were still in bed and there was two i had three little ones of my own and no help
 no one to leave them with we got them dressed but the girls stayed till their mother got well again
 and took them to a neighbour s about two miles she felt i had added greatly to her recovery in
 away a nd then drove twelve miles to grassy lake sending her girl to help me she was showing her
 where the doctor was located he set my arm and gratitude a nd it was really a sacrifice too as
 the i drove home again wondering how i could ever girl was badly needed at home manage alone then a
 neighbour girl ca me in and in our district we were pretty much one big fasa id ma sent me
 and i ain t agone home either rnily no matter what the nationality there were she sa id i could
 look after the kids she was only the german settlers and the swedes and dutch and fourteen but i didn
 t have he heart to send her back a few norwegia ns who wer e all pretty much in home
 so we had to get busy and build an addi small settlements then there were english scottion to the house
 for we only had one large room tish and irish and a number of eastern canadians divided by curtains when
 there was any sickness there were always pethaps i should explain why this neighbour felt willing helpers and when sorrow
 came we a ll felt indebted to me and had sent her girl to help about it a year before
 my accident someone told me that the first real sorrow that i shared in was the the girl s mother
 was very ill and not expected to death of a baby boy the first child of a young coulive i
 went to see hen and offer my help mrs pie from ireland the child had never been well kirk was
 there nursing hen and she told me it was from birth and everything that could be was done a case
 of blood poisoning through neglect at child to save him towards the last we took turns at sitbirth the woman
 was german and had quite a ting up at night to allow the parents to rest but number of little
 ones and as doctors were far away in spite of all the care little tommy passed away a nd the
 cost of bringing them too much for these all the neighbours for miles round came to the poor people they
 had a neighbour come in funeral whenever a baby was expected they came in wagons democr ats and buggies 28
 and all drove to burdett for the burial when the sinking of the titanic and i heard dr mewburn little
 white coffin was lowered into the grave one say surely it cannot be as bad as they say now mourner
 said to us neighbour s we have no it was impossible to get hired help so one of my minister
 but let us sing ‘ shall we gather at the neighbours looked after my children while i was river and
 then repeat the lord s prayer i have in the hospital i felt very lonely there and i was oftimes
 wondered since just how many did sing glad when the time came to go home i got back even now
 when i recall that day a lump rises in just at lambing time and there was plenty work for my
 throat we had lunches at all hours and our baking had i was never well after that accident when my
 all to be done at home we could not go to town arm was broken and after suffering for two
 years and buy bread on cakes so we had to make our i went to see a doctor in lethbridge
 he found that own my neighbour could not stay any longer so i had been hurt internally when the horse
 had another neighbour sent her girl to help me till i was knocked me down i was on the operating
 table strong again on april 14 th l 9 i 2 when the news came of the to be continued

 month for jacques jewely robbery broke jail about 3 o clock this morning his escape was discovered in less than
 fifteen minutes afterwards and the mounted police are now scouring the country but so far no trace of the prisoner
 has been found it is generally supposed that his escape was planned f rom the outside by parties whom the
 evidence expected to be given at the trial would injure winnipeg sept 24 the escape of freddy shoults is a
 matter of little surprise to the authorities here who took an interest in the arrest of the young scamp the
 lax manner in which the officials at calgar y conducted police business was a matter of comment here up to
 date the warrant for the arrest of a certain winnipegger which chief english wired had been issued has not been
 received in this city non is it likely to come to hand shoults is well known in this city where
 he bore a most unsavory character the police department know his record and give him credit for being anything but
 a model lad he has seen the inside of the city police cells but the efforts of all his pals
 could not effect his escape from the clutches of the city police it is a matter of surprise that one
 with so tough a record as shoults had should have been allowed to escape calgary sept 26 freddy shoults who
 escaped from the barracks guard house on thursday last was recaptured this morning at a house near the town where
 he has been in hiding ever since his escape a clue was discovered last night and the house watched with

 is in charge of the mounted police here for the prompt steps taken by him winnipeg tribune sept 24 26
