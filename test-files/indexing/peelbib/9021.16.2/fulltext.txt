 a year english writers in the early west by bruce peel when our prairie region was a frontier several englishmen
 recognized its potentiality as a locale for stories of action and adventure the stories t h e s e men
 wrote were juveniles and light fiction but the books enjoyed a popularity among the reading public of britain which enabled
 their writers to live by their pens most of these writers had two things in common they had resided a
 few years in western canada and they became professional writers a ft e r a first western revealed to them
 the saleability of frontier fiction the first writer i shall mention is trade the manuscript first published r m ballantyne

 commence a publication called ‘ the bulletin the time of the year was fly season and the bull dogs in
 those days were as large as young toy balloons among mr oliver s horses was a colt which had won
 its way into the l ieart of the pioneer so much so that at one noon camp he decided to
 protect th colt from the flies so ho sewed it up with white cotton the colt s mother with the
 rest of the horses was feeding a short way off and kept calling to its offspring during the dressmaking operations
 the job was done even to the short knickers and frills and a most comical picture the colt presented across
 the camp the colt started for its delayed noonday meal its mother saw it coming and not recognising her son
 and heir in this white mysterious looking object bolted all the rest of the bunch went with her with heeds
 high and tails erect leaving frank oliver praying for a few charges of chain lightning and a gatling gun or
 two the bulletin plant was delayed just two days as it took that time for the colt to get tired

 macdonell o s b when i first came to canada before the great war i had in view to or
 anize the settlement of british people on land in canada after serving as chaplain with the western scots regiment in
 france i went to ontario where my settlement schemes were a failure then after 21 years i got in touch
 with archbishop o leary of edmonton who invited me to his archdiocese where he said he would do all he
 could for me he could not help to provide farms for the scottish families that i wanted to bring to
 canada but would provide churches schools etc and would welcome me personally to stay with him i then told the
 canadian pacific rail were anxious to return to russia where way s colonization department that i they looked for a
 new paradise was in touch with quite a number of the delegation arrived in scotland people who were ready to
 migrate to in the fall but i did not hear a word canada i knew that they had little from
 any one of them for several months conception of life in canada and sug however as a bolt from the
 blue i had gested that it might be a good idea if a a cable from col dennis of the
 c p r small delegation were brought over in the spring saying that 50 families of from the hebrides that
 was agreed to hebrideans had sold out and were ready and in the fall of 1922 a delegation of to
 sail for canada half of them had four men came headed by father no money donald maclntyre i led them
 over parts of saskatchewan alberta and b c this was certainly an unexpected denoument but the situation had to be
 alberta was selected as the province faced for those families had given up offering the best opportunity and red their
 homes later i learned that the deer was to be the centre a former delegation had said nothing of canada
 indian school with good buildings and or of our plans of preparing for only 18 a farm of 1100 acres
 was available it families who had a considerable sum of was agreed that a party of 18 families money the
 delegation was really secrewould be enough to begin settlement tive norman macleod one of them had and that each family
 should have 1 000 said you will see what i shall do myor at least 750 capital to purchase a
 self and no more then on a certain farm and to provide certain equipment sunday his bill of sale of
 his farm stock etc was stuck on the church door and the delegation then returned to then the race began
 scotland they were to explain to their neighbours what they had seen and their meantime i was alone with this
 proown ideas as to the opportunities for blem on my hands what was i to do settlement meantime i got
 busy making i had the 35 farms ready if they were advance arrangements i got 35 farms acceptable to the
 newcomers however appraised by an officer of the soldiers these farms would be of no good to the settlement board
 and declared suitable families who had no money for people with their limited capital i consulted officers of soldiers set
 the farmers wore ready to sell as they tlement board in regard to homes that this manuscript frouui the glenbow

 settlers to the west original copies of time manuscript ülso 0:ulso are in archives of st benedict s abbey fort augustus
 scotland 5 might be available on certain farms i ten were ex servicemen and they were then called on premier
 herbert green to go into farm training under the soldier field of alberta he was keenly inter settlement board ested
 and considered the finding of such farm homes and farm work for settlers we arrived at red deer at 10
 4 5 and to be the ideal way of starting new received a great welcome from the corners into the
 ways of the country he citizens a piper was playing and the called in his minister of agriculture and whole
 town turned out speeches of asked him to set his department onto welcome were given by the mayor mr the
 job of finding work and homes the welliver and when the second party minister took me to his office and
 we came in on the c n r at 5 00 p m the welcome was repeated continued the discussion
 there but he asked me to return the following week the red deer people took the new as he was
 very busy i did so and he arrivals out to the school in their cars still was busy and would
 i return next thus saving much expense they were week i replied that i could not as the really kind
 and generous a good dinner people were already on the ocean on awaited them and they all found nice their
 way to canada would he be kind clean beds prepared for them at the enough to wire me to ottawa
 and state school what he was able to do within two or three weeks we were at ottawa mr blair
 of the coloniza joined by fifteen of the twenty families tion department was not convinced that who had been placed
 in work by govern i could find homes and work in alberta ment officials furthermore our memfor 20 moneyless families
 and strongly bers were added to by the advent of six advised that i divide them up five in or
 eight families who had gone to manitoba ten in saskatchewan and five ontario over a year before and had not
 in alberta been settled because of unforeseen conditions thus we again had over fifty i did not get a wire
 from the alberta families to deal with minister of agriculture as agreed so i wired him and asked him to
 notify me the farms that had been appraised at st john n b what he was able to were west
 of red deer at eckville and do while standing on the docks at st that neighbourhood some of the people
 john watching the ship being tied up were taken to look over these farms but i was given two telegrams
 one from mr the down payment scared them and blair again urging me to divide up the none of the
 farms was taken families and the second from the minister the morning after our arrival i went in alberta saying
 regret this govern to see the birch lake ranch near innisment unable to settle any one of your free this
 fine ranch was in the bankfamilies ruptcy court and it was thought that we the families landed about 300 souls
 could get it at a fair price the snag and travelled in two parties to the west however was that
 we would need to go one by c n r and one by c p r when to the banks
 for money to buy and also the two parties eventually foregathered the wherewithal for houses barns stock at winnipeg i
 had to inform them of the and implements i was scared of it government s decision to divide the fami
 fortunately the judge would not let it lies with no money into three parties and out of court at the
 price that the soldier place them in the three prairie provinces settlement board officers appraised it at it took us
 at least ten days to be later i interviewed privately the clear of that but the respite was useful head
 of each family so as to learn who had money and who had not notifying to me as i was
 enabled to study the situation the latter that government officials would look after them and place them i went to
 h gordon superintendent where they would have a home and get of the soldier settlement board at edwork the following
 day i moved off monton and asked him how many farms to alberta with thirty families of these they had
 on their hands in this area 6 a scottish settler hugh macphee leaves for his farm near ohaton in 1923
 lie said about three hundred i want farms were not up to much so we made a number of them
 for my people but a selection of about six or eight out of your people have no money that does
 the fourteen the cottages were poorly not matter ycu put a price on the farms built and when we arrived
 they had not on the stock and equipment and the been lived in for some little time on people will
 pay icr them in time the second day or night after our five settlers arrived there was a terrific rain
 after some demur he agreed and storm which drove through the dried the v icrk began every day we took
 roofs and walls of the cottages that two or three heads of families to inspect was enough next day four
 of our farms and to say whether they would settlers left two going to edmonton and accept or reject this
 went on for about two returning to red deer six weeks no one was obliged to accept any particular farm
 he had his the arrival of the two disappointed choice of several settlers became known in edmonton and the most
 successful were about eight the minister of agriculture got them to or ten families that we placed in the his
 office his purpose was not prompted westlock area with one exception they by generosity or kindliness he was the did
 well we took several heads of fami same man who sent me the disappointlies along there and they carefully ex
 ing wire that i got at st john nb rimmed the farms available after two despite his telegram he had
 come to days we returned to the amazement of red deer to see the crowd of 346 souls officers and
 others a brisk conversation that were under my care at the school in gaelic took place between the set i
 was away but he was met by rev tlers and me each had chosen his place macmillan who took him
 around the buildings and the yards where the in about two months time from their people were congregated after looking
 arrival we had placed nearly fifty fanii them over and talking with some and lies on farms which was quite
 an learning that they were negotiating to achievement during this time we buy farms he got the people together learned
 of some raw land farms for and spoke to them such a fine class canadian soldiere who had not stayed
 of settlers must not expend their hardmore than a year or two they had earned money in buying land they
 must however broke some land there were be provided with free dominion land fourteen farms in the one small area
 and he would undertake to see them thus i thought it would be ideal for a group provided for and
 he would send men of our settlers however on close in out with them to show them how to build
 spection it was evident that some of the their own houses to build a school and a bigger and better
 house for the father the least he could do was to hear both rev j macmillan sides he explained that
 they were interested in news i asked why not ac this address created quite a stir and curate news he
 talked volubly for rev macmillan did nothing to allay it quite a time and then added we cer when i
 returned to red deer a day or tainly have great respect for the people so later i confronted with a
 distinctly from the new hebrides i stared at new attitude and was told that the that he repeated it and
 then i laughed minister was a gentleman and knew and made a sign to the lawyer and we what he
 was talking about i asked if left what was the good the people the minister had told them of the
 loca of the new hebrides natives of the tion of this free dominion land they south pacific did not know
 i said it is too late to call him now but i shall get him on from the attack in
 the edmonton the phone in the morning paper started a campaign in the press that went on for two months
 with as about 10 am i called the minister s much sense and knowledge as shown by office and as
 soon as i mentioned who the reference to the new hebrides i i was he at once gave me the
 same line said nothing but went ahead with the that he had given the people about the help of officers
 of the soldier settlement free dominion land as soon as i could board steadily placing our families by get a
 word in i asked where is the free one two or three every second day until dominion land he replied
 it is we got all those who came to red deer about 30 miles from the end of steel arranged
 for at that time the campaign from a little town called after me i against us was shifted from the
 press asked is that land just west and north to the house of commons in ottawa west of pigeon lake
 that is it ex the member for red deer moved the actly i replied i know that land it adjournment
 of the house to consider a is good but it won t do it is one dense grave situation that
 existed in his conforest good land but it needs to be stituency the debate went on for three brushed and
 cleared do you realize or four hours it was reported that that many of these people have never evening in
 the edmonton newspapers seen a tree until they left their own islands it would take about two years next morning
 i wired to the minister work to get fields that would support of colonization and i understand my them what
 is to happen to the wives wire was read to the house all fifty and children during these two years
 families now settled on farms with the you take care of them thanks i exception of six who are under
 training said somewhat sarcastically but gene by soldier settlement board and will be rally a man finds it quite enough
 to settled in due course all were well care for one wife and family but to care housed and well
 fed during their stay for fifty wives and families for two at red deer years the violent adverse campaign stop
 this was the same man who con ped in a day unfortunately about this tacted the two settlers who had
 left time the press of great britain got it their farms he put leading questions to but i doubt if
 they ever got the gist of them and got a stenographer to take my telegram to the minister i think
 i down the conversations next morning should mention that one of the two who there appeared a column and a
 half in went to edmonton came to me later to one of the local newspapers condemning beg my pardon for
 all that he had the bringing of people into the country been made to say in his cooler moments with
 no adequate preparation he realized that much had been said that did not ring true on the following day i
 took a lawyer with me to interview the manager of as soon as the settlement was cornthe newspaper and asked
 what he meant plete i was determined not to be alone by publishing a screed of inaccuracies in future accordingly
 i organized the 8 scottish immigrant aid society and in the canadian colonization departcoroporated it under the laws of the

 to london among my directors were three million one of the chief officials of the coloniaires general stewart of vancouver
 was zation department backed up my appeal my president and colonel j s dennis to the overseas settlement office and
 chief commissioner of colonization they agreed to build 100 more cottages c p r was my vice president i was
 i was given the job of supervising the elected managing director erection of them but when we had built at
 one of our first meetings i ex fifty four i stopped further work because plained the lack of houses for
 farm i realized that conditions were rapidly labour throughout our area of alberta changing farmers soon would not be i
 proposed that we build fourteen cot in a position to employ outside help tages between edmonton and red deer particularly
 would they be unable to each on a two acre plot the prospective hire men for year round work settler
 who would take up farm labour first would thus have a home and would in the month of february 1924
 be free to take service with any farmer was in glasgow there i met archbishop in the neighbourhood each cottage
 macintosh and archbishop o leary of would cost 750 four of my directors edmonton and bishop martin of argyll agreed
 right away to make up the and the isles the talk was of emigraamount that i needed a sum of
 over tion and archbishop macintosh was 11 000 or 2 750 each i filled these anxious to help in any
 way he could cottages when the next batch of settlers and he passed a remark that bishop arrived and their
 work and the exper martin should lead all his hebrideans to canada ience they picked up were of immense value
 to them when they got on farms after the glasgow meeting i went of their own to the hebrides and
 there i found that crowds gather at the dock at lochboisdale to bid farewell to relatives leaving scotland on the
 marlock for a new life in alberta in 1924 9 father macmillan who was visiting was greatly disappointed at the
 orderly there had been truly eloquent in extol fashion in which all had been cornling canada and urged the people
 to pleted so he tried an up to date scoop emigrate i found moreover that he he invented the story
 of a furious scrap had said a little too much for he stated having taken place on lochboisdale i was
 told that there were farms await pier when the emigrants were leaving ing every family that would emigrate some time
 later i got the story of the fake fight and was told what happened this had to be corrected right
 away to the too enterprising reporter there so i made my way from island to island were several prominent journalists
 on and interviewed every individual who board the marloch and they were very had given his name as an intending
 im angry when the daily express came out migrant i stated emphatically to each with the fake story neil munro
 sir and all that there were no farms await john lorne macleod and other leading ing them but that there
 would be a journalists who were on board took the house cottage or some dwelling place matter up with the
 paper and the reand farm labour we had fourteen porter had his walking papers that day society cottages and the
 officers of the he was dismissed on the spot soldier settlement board had by this time located some 160 dwellings
 in the the cottage scheme by now had neighbourhood of the edmonton calgary come into its own and the families
 who line this was a telling commentary on worked out for over a year when the co operative spirit of
 the alberta eventually placed on farms of their own minister whose department could not forged right ahead find any such
 aid in the province according to his telegram to me the pre when the hebrideans were settled i vious year
 i told the people however returned to the united kingdom there that i was in good hopes that if they
 i was told that many catholic families worked well for a year or two we might in northern ireland were
 anxious to join have farms for them all us and to go farming in canada i crossed to ireland to
 interview prospec fifty or sixty families were ready tive emigrants and there could be no to come to canada but
 some of these doubt about their need to improve their i advised not to go as the head of the
 lot they were poverty stricken and family was too old eventually forty were eloquent in their story all they eight
 families were ready to sail on needed was a chance so they said and march 28 th 1924 i boarded
 the c p r i believed them it was my first meeting liner marloch at glasgow with the of the
 kind with irishmen in their own intention of sailing to the hebrides to country some 250 souls were ready to
 pick up the whole of these forty eight leave almost as soon as i got here and families of about
 280 or 300 souls they sailed from belfast in the same there were forty one newspaper cor year 1924 respondents
 on board who were anxious i told them there were no farms to see the migration and to publicise it
 ready but we would find cottages and we arrived off lochboisdale shortly farm work for them on arrival we after
 10 am the s s hebrides placed them all in jobs and in farm brought in the barra immigrants and
 cottages but most of this party were on later in the day she took on board the the move from
 the beginning many of south uist and benbecula folk and pro them made their way to the united ceeded to
 our liner that was anchored states where all appeared to have about a mile off shore a gangway was friends
 comparatively few of that party put out from the marloch and all ever attained to a farm of their own
 emigrants boarded the newspaper cor some were deported respondents left the liner by the this episode taught me a good
 deal hebrides and sailed for glasgow i was determined that in future any pros speaking of newspaper men a re

 captain who explored the region a century ago to determine its suitability for agriculture he reported it was unsuited except
 for the grazing of stock but in the years that followed his advice went unregarded this was the great buffalo
 grazing ground of bygone days even in the ‘ nineties it was a potential and in the dry ‘ thirties
