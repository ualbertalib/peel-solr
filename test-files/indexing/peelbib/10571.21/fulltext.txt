 the patrician 10 first battalion report training the emphasis during the period before wainwright concentration was placed on completing individual 
 training and progressive collective training on the section platoon and company levels with a view to bringing the battalion back 
 to peak condition for the summer concentration the battalion continued to take advantage of the multitude of courses offered at 
 the various schools throughout canada and now contains experts in many fields a total of 47 all ranks qualified on 
 army courses and six on the civil defence courses at arnprior and vancouver within the battalion the following numbers were 
 qualified 41 on infantry signaller 0:sig 0:naller group 1 18 on infantry anti tank gunner group 1 23 on infantry 
 mortarman group 1 17 on infantry machine gunner group 1 63 on infantry driver group 1 two officers passed lieutenant 
 to captain part 1 during march each company spent a week at chilliwack undergoing watermanship training in co operation with 
 1 field engineer regiment wainwright after having dispensed with the niceties such as a church parade and a few sporting 
 events we got down to the business at hand call sign niner kicked off with an interesting exercise named stilletto 
 the aim of which was to exercise platoons in the advance to contact each platoon was put through this exercise 
 mainly for shakedown 0:shake 0:down purposes the first to go through was 1 platoon shepherded by the voice lt hutchinson 
 call sign niner walked the course nine times the next item of real interest was ex nightmare which consisted of 
 a company group advancing by night across country from bushy head to seize the junction of brown and red routes 
 at first light this exercise went well except that the question as to whether or not call sign two was 
 on purple route or the fireguard at 0200 hrs has never been answered ex soltau followed nightmare being a battalion 
 shake down exercise the new battle adjutant who was appointed the day before the exercise started was the most directly 
 affected individual no one was more shaken down than he the final exercise for phase 1 was ex cutlass which 
 practiced company 0:com 0:pany groups in the advance to contact the casualties on the third day when call sign three 
 was being exercised were quite heavy the quick attack which ended the exercise featured one of the assault platoons taking 
 on the fire platoon while the enemy engaged them from the flank phaser 2 and 3 were no doubt of 
 good training value but most participants 0:par 0:ticipants will agree that this was exceeded by their value as a source 
 of amusing anecdotes it was agreed by all that wireless security and good communications were to be practised throughout the 
 concentration the cp was therefore 
 the patrician 11 surprised at being entertained by the declarers of this principle when they found themselves wrestling with a 
 slidex in the previous day s key and map references in compromised code to further confuse the issue they sent 
 a sitrep in correct slidex to which they received the reply splendid this may have referred either to their ability 
 to use slidex or to the dash of our call sign niner who knows 17 march celebrations as is customary 
 the regimental birthday was celebrated by brooma 100 0:broom 0:a 0:100 competitions and a parade broom a 100 this year 
 was played on the sports field and in the final inter company game c coy emerged triumphant the trophy for 
 the officers sergeants match was this year brought home by the officers which leaves the score in wins even on 
 17 march the battalion paraded through the streets of victoria watched by large numbers of the citizens the comments in 
 victoria newspapers were highly complimentary regarding the parade and we feel that we are most welcome here following the parade 
 all ranks attended divine service at churches in victoria goc s annual inspection on 3 may major general c yokes 
 cb cbe dso cd general officer commanding western command inspected the battalion because the new parade square was not yet 
 ready the parade was held in macdonald park four companies each of five officers and eighty men were formed commanded 
 by majors mcphail macquarrie moncrief and kerfoot about six hundred of the public watched the parade which followed a form 
 with which the battalion was hitherto unfamiliar all ranks performed exceptionally 0:ex 0:ceptionally well and the goc appeared pleased forced 
 march competition held on 16 may this was as usual a gruelling and close competition conducted over the five miles 
 between albert head and weir s beach just short of mary hill the first team to leave a coy started 
 out at 0930 hrs followed at 20 minute intervals by b c d and sp coy teams they were inspected 
 prior to leaving in accordance with the instructions contained in pachino day sports meet regulations they were again inspected on 
 completion of the march the course was hilly and on asphalt throughout its length the fastest time was 59 minutes 
 and the slowest 64 minutes overall the condition of the troops was excellent although naturally there were many sore feet 
 and tired muscles a total of 5 men fell out of the competition the winning team this year came from 
 c company led by lt dl stone trooping the ceremony of trooping the colour carried out by the first battalion 
 at work point baracks on 31 may is believed to have been the first such ceremony ever carried out by 
 a regular force unit in this part of canada together with its accompanying social functions the ceremony 
 the patrician 12 1 pppcli trooping 3l may 58 was a great success and was enjoyed by all who attended 
 two of the social functions deserve special mention one was the all ranks luncheon held in the men s kitchen 
 on 29 may as its name denotes this luncheon enabled all ranks of the battalion to assemble together and we 
 were all privileged to be addressed by the colonel and founder of the regiment the second function of note was 
 the victoria branch regimental 0:regi 0:mental association lunch held at the pacific club on 30 may this too was attended 
 by brigadier gault and over 60 members of the association the battalion was represented by the commanding officer the secondin 
 command 0:second 0:in 0:command the adjutant and the regimental sergeant major the privilege of having brigadier gault and mrs gault 
 with us at the trooping was especially gratifying because of the great number of old patricias present many of whom 
 served with or were themselves old originals the weather on the morning of 31 may threatened rain but fortunately the 
 sky cleared a little as the day wore on some 3500 invited guests and about 1500 additional members of the 
 general public turned out to watch the battalion troop its colour if the publicity and the enthusiasm of those who 
 witnessed the ceremony are any indication of the future our biggest worry for years to come will be to provide 
 sitting room for the spectators boxing after the area championships on 28 feb 58 our boxers concentrated in chilliwack to 
 prepare for their next step toward the army finals on 10 march they left for calgary and the western command

 as part of the army contingent for the international diamond belt boxing tournament in mexico city english rugby some old 
 patricias may remember the rugger team of 1934 39 which became bc champions when we heard of this we decided 
 to give it a try ourselves undaunted by the fact that only three persons in the battalion had played before 
 we began practicing twice a week after a few instructional periods games were played with the following results lost to 
 victoria college twice 15 6 and 16 10 lost to oak bay bc second division champions 15 3 defeated hmcs 
 venture 6 3 tied royal roads 3 3 
 the patrician 14 with this the season ended english rugby has now become a permanent sport in the battalion and 
 we hope to field a strong team next season sports tournament 12 14 may the necessity of supplying a wide 
 variety of teams for pachino day and as usual the scarcity of time for preparation led the battalion to hold 
 a tournament of sports this year rather than wait for battalion league winners to be declared also at stake was 
 the texas bar trophy presented annually to the company which amasses the greatest aggregate points in sports c company winners 
 of last year s french grey cup which also counted on this year s aggregate started off strongly by winning 
 the tabloid sports thus piling up a large lead the tabloid sports were held in place of a track and 
 field meet knockout tourneys were also held in volleyball fastball tug of war and horse shoes in volleyball the strong 
 support company team was easily victorious sweeping aside c company but having a rather more difficult time with a determined 
 b company in the finals the hq company team were apparently the best at the grunting and groaning game as 
 they defeated a company to take the championship in two straight pulls c company added to their grip on first 
 place by winning the horseshoes again from a company sp company won the novelty sports and so we came to 
 the fastball final between c and sp companies with the former leading by a few scant points and the championship 
 depending 0:depend 0:ing on the outcome of the ball game it was a close game but the issue was never 
 in doubt after third inning as sp company came through with a 4 0 win the coveted trophy has been 
 taken out to sp company s little empire at mccauley point from whence the other companies may find it hard 
 to win it back pachino day i jul 58 while we failed to steal the second battalion thunder on the 
 brigade sports day the battalion teams turned in a creditable performance inspired 0:in 0:spired no doubt by the sort of 
 westphalian weather we have enjoyed for the past two years forced march team provided in the main by c company 
 the unit team turned in its best performance of the year to place second in a good contest with 2 
 ppcli and 1 qor of c we did achieve the unique distinction however of being led across the finish line 
 by the provost corps lt stone softball the softball team advanced to the semi finals before bowing out to our 
 2nd battalion considering that they had not played a game this year before the tournament our team put up a 
 fine show outstanding performances were turned in by ptes smith hecks and larson volleyball our team was not up to 
 its former standard and was knocked out in the first round by the strathconas

 the patrician 16 horseshoes the long training program instituted on 30 jun 58 for the horseshoe team paid big dividends 
 as the doubles cpls lee and mclean took the brigade championship this our first win of the day apparently went 
 unnoticed in the din of the novelty sports tabloid sports held in place of a track and field meet this 
 event proved a gruelling and exciting four hours of straight competition for the team if not for the spectators while 
 it was impossible to accurately assess who was leading until the end it was a close struggle between the two 
 battalions 0:bat 0:talions of the patricias and the strathconas we finished second after an all out effort by every member 
 of the team relay race the battalion 440 relay team treated the crowd to a fine display of sprinting as 
 they won with ease to set a new battalion record of 45 4 seconds lt hunt l cpls leighton and 
 mark and pte muszynski formed the team novelty sports ln the novelty events the ist battalion held its own in 
 three events particularly the boys in the powder blue jerseys shone the coy shuttle race the verbal message relay and 
 the horse and jockey race the success of the novelty events was perhaps indicated by the state of the oval 
 where these events were conducted the track had become a quagmire of water stale bread beer the odd ammo boot 
 and a baseball bat all this much to the dismay and disgust of the 440 relay team tug of war 
 the ist battalion tug of war team met its waterloo rather early in the form of the strathconas the coach 
 still insists that the ldsh anchor man was actually a centurion shooting the first event was the bc area shoot 
 in the canadian army rifle shooting competition held on blair range vancouver on 6 jun 58 in which we competed 
 against the vancouver wireless station this was the first experience with this type of competition for most of the team 
 members however we won by a good margin the weather was excellent and the vancouver boys were a fine group 
 of competitors immediately after this shoot the small arms teams for the brigade competitions at wainwright were formed practice time 
 was limited by trooping rehearsals and militia summer camps the brigade competition was held in wainwright on saturday 28 aug

 social calendar commencing 0:com 0:mencing with a formal dinner dance on 17 march to celebrate our colonelin chief s 0:colonel 
 0:in 0:chief 0:s birthday while nothing unusual occurred the dinner was good and as usual everyone enjoyed the products of 
 messrs seagram calvert ct al on 23 march we experimented with a family sunday luncheon our offspring enjoyed some novel 
 instruction in eating habits from one another while their parents relaxed the little monsters were then cunningly 0:cun 0:ningly enticed 
 into the black pit with promise of movies with which they were royally entertained while their parents dined in peace 
 unfortunately 0:un 0:fortunately there was a break out and a concerted uprising was only prevented by the prompt action of 
 two stalwart single officers lts snowball and maione who deserve honorable mention for quelling the rebellion with no bloodshed a 
 millionaire s night was held on 29 march with counterfeit cash courtesy of doug bell who incidentally missed his calling 
 selling at the inflated rate of 1 000 00 for 1 00 in spite of the misguided efforts of the 
 blackjack dealer dave snowball who was apparently under the impression that it was a give away night the mess managed 
 to coin a little badly needed cash it was just as well bob peacock did not use any of the 
 money he counterfeited previously an excellent luncheon was provided on 10 april on the occasion of a visit by the 
 goc officers commanding major units and staff officers from command and area headquarters that evening after an hour of free 
 drinks everyone partook of a buffet supper and relaxed to the music of the dance which was obviously enjoyed by 
 the goc on 16 april a beer and oyster function was held for the purpose of meeting the officers of 
 all militia units in victoria although his wife put the arm on our chief songster bob muir early in the 
 evening a good time was had by all the high point of the evening being a rather involved story about 
 an enormous elephant named mahmoud as told by tom hill an ex officer of the ldsh rc whom many patricias 
 will remember sports minded members have been engaging in a number of activities foremost of which is golf a year 
 round sport in this fair country we have 
 the patrician 19 four open memberships with the gorge vale golf club and one can locate our mo don fraser 
 on the course almost any afternoon accordingly he was awarded the job of arranging a golf tournament this proved interesting 
 since most of our members don t know a golf club from a billiard cue a number of prizes were 
 available we understand that the mo was ensuring one for himself by allotting one for the most dishonest 0:dis 0:honest 
 player swimming in the mess pool became popular in june the pool was cleaned out with the help of some 
 volunteers from the rcn who were enjoying army hospitality in our crowbar hotel and was soon ready for use after 
 the long period of neglect 31 may was a big day in the mess after the trooping a garden party 
 was held on the lawn attended by swarms of guests in the evening the trooping dance was held there were 
 fewer people at this than in previous 0:pre 0:vious years but everyone enjoyed it very much on 7 june lt 
 setten took on the ball and chain of marriage a stag party was held the night before the wedding and 
 after being tried trooped thrown in the pool and generally filled in he slept peacefully until morning when he awoke 
 to find his left arm and right leg in casts however he recuperated by two o clock in the afternoon 
 just in time for the wedding at wainwright the mess was patronized for the most part by officers of battalion 
 headquarters however there were occasion when it became very crowded such as the evening when a very delicious buffet supper 
 was provided attended by many officers of the brigade including the commander the tragedy of the month was the loss 
 of the fur lined trophy to the sergeants mess at the games night one thing at least can be said 
 the sergeants won the boat race fairly we are in the process of losing a great number of officers already 
 on his way to a posting with the rifle brigade in england is lt dave snowball captains brian simons and 
 bob peacock have left for rmc kingston major lilley is soon to leave for bc area headquarters and major macquarrie 
 will soon be on his way to the middle east capt doug honeyman is going to become a headshrinker at

 going back to their own corps sergeants mess on 17 march with the traditional parades successfully over in the morning 
 all members of the mess gathered on the sports field to watch or participate in the annual struggle between the 
 officers and sergeants at broom a 100 owing to the lack of ice and frozen brooms the bruises and casualties 
 were nil the final score officers 1 sergeants 0 the 
 the patrician 20 the officers team enjoyed refreshments after the game with the sergeants team playing host on the same 
 evening a dance was held which was well attended everyone had an enjoyable time and as always the food was 
 plentiful and well prepared there were a number of old familiar faces present making for pleasant reunions and letting us 
 relive some fond old memories on 29 may a cocktail party was held in honour of brigadier a hamilton gault 
 and mrs gault also in attendance were lt col de faye and mrs de faye and the company commanders and 
 their wives mrs ea mcdow acted as hostess and tea was poured by mrs j thomson mrs jb mackie and 
 mrs ag kenny immediately after the trooping on 31 may we held open house the purpose being to renew old 
 friendships and make new friends this was followed in the evening by an informal dance honoured by the visit of 
 col wilson smith the month of june was quiet as we were preparing for the move to wainwright there the 
 officers and ourselves held the games night which has become a yearly event once again we won the fur lined 
 pot the score being 115 to 45 i think on 16 july still at wainwright the mess held a stag 
 party for the second battalion which was a roaring success several changes in members have occurred since the last issue 
 of the patrician early in the summer the mess welcomed back sgt slim woolley sgt bell and sgt kisko we 
 must now say goodbye to sgt erfurt sgt davies sgt dionne and sgt rollins to all of them we wish 
 good luck in their new postings we congratulate sgt and mrs candoiseau on the arrival of their baby daughter on 
 24 apr 58 at the time of writing the battalion is just going on annual leave we plan to hold

 continued to drop in to say hello and talk over old times it is nice to have them in to 
 bring back old memories

 entertainment committee consisting of such able members as cpl mitchell jr cpl holley hr and cpl nestor gt it was

 down at wainwright here s hoping for a lively time after we get back from a very welcome month s 
 leave men s canteen during the first few months of the year the canteen settled into its new quarters at 
 workpoint barracks any move is followed by a period of re adjustment and our s was no exception however the 
 services of the canteen were soon functioning smoothly and providing the best possible service once again march april and may 
 saw three very successful events sponsored by the men s canteen on 17 march the canteen participated in the reception 
 0:recep 0:tion held after the annual broom a 100 finals and in the evening a dance was held the theme 
 of the dance held in may was springtime an eternal theme at our new station in victoria the date chosen 
 was 3 may the date of the goc s annual inspection the canteen was appropriately decorated and an air of 
 springtime gaiety prevailed as one and all enjoyed themselves thoroughly the event of the year took place on 31 may 
 the trooping dance was held in the men s kitchen the affair was supported by the largest number of personnel 
 to attend any of the canteen s events the kitchen was of course decorated in the regimental theme the focal 
 point of which was a list of the regimental battle honors the dance was a successful climax to the first 
 ceremony of trooping the colour that the ist battalion has put on in our new home in victoria june was 
 a quiet month a period of recuperation from the festivities of trooping and of preparation for wainwright 
 the patrician 22 in wainwright the canteen was established in a marquee although for the first two weeks of the 
 concentration a great deal of beer was consumed around the nightly bonfires where a spirit of convivial companionship 0:com 0:panionship 
 prevailed during phases 2 and 3 the canteen was mounted in an office lorry and this mobile pub was a 
 welcome sight in the company localities during the heat of the weather and the exercises on 28 july centered by 
 a huge bonfire and cases of beer the first and second battalions met for a giant farewell to the wainwright 
 party this was a smashing success second battalion he port introduction since the last report this unit has been involved 
 in a busy and diversified 0:diversi 0:fied programme highlighted by the trooping the colour for the first time in our 
 new home station during the historic visit of brigadier a hamilton gault and by the memorable battles of exercise powerglide 
 and exercise hotfoot ii during the wainwright summer concentration all of us felt that our annual leave in august was 
 well earned following an eventful and successful training year with leave over we have already embarked on a busy start 
 to the 1958 59 training year training home station at the end of march 1958 the end of last year 
 s individual training cycle was marked by the reformation of the sections and platoons within the companies and training up 
 to platoon level commenced the aim of this period was to bring each platoon up to a fighting fit standard 
 which would enable it to be tested under field conditions during the collective training period at camp wainwright and to 
 not be found wanting to accomplish this most of the available time was devoted to physical conditioning tests of elementary 
 training annual classification and platoon tactics the really hard and fit condition of the battalion during summer training was not 
 the result simply of wainwright s fresh air but rather the route marches around edmonton while there was still snow 
 on the ground and the grunts and groans of men trying to climb a rope and the puffs and pants 
 of men trying to run two miles in eighteen minutes and the sweat and swearing of men being chased around 
 the gymnasium all this and more which began long before the first brave crocus dared peak through the snow ssgt 
 mulholland and the rest of his pt cadre were the ones largely responsible they were the ones who damned at 
 the beginning when muscles were sore were praised at the end when the trophies came pouring into the unit for 
 being able to march five miles in an hour in battle order and carrying a rifle run two miles in 
 eighteen minutes run eighty yards and fire five rounds scoring each hit all in ninety seconds climb a rope twelve 
 feet up twenty feet across and twelve feet down carry a fully equipped man one hundred yards jump a nine 
 foot ditch while 
 the patrician 23 armed and in battle order scale a six foot wall without assistance for doing all this better 
 than any other platoon in the battalion the pioneer platoon won the platoon physical efficiency trophy who says the pioneer 
 platoon commander lt jgh honey is to heavy he did it all too and for doing all this better than 
 any other company in the battalion a company won the company physical efficiency trophy although they lost out on overall 
 points b company deserves special mention for their five mile march b was the only company to finish without the 
 loss of a man and without a straggler and all in fiftythree 0:fifty 0:three minutes concurrently with the hardening training 
 the individual skills of all ranks were being tested with the tests of elementary training toets perhaps it was because 
 the sight of the 3 5 inch rocket launcher has really got too many lines on it and perhaps it 
 was because people didn t know they had all thumbs on their hands until they tried to fill a sten 
 magazine within a time limit and perhaps it was because the respirator doesn t have windshield wipers built into the 
 eye pieces but whatever the reasons there is no denying that the rocket launcher sten magazine and respirator gave more 
 trouble during the toets than anything else despite this however averages in the battalion were high and after the scores 
 were all added up 2 platoon had won the platoon teots trophy and a company had won the company toets 
 trophy although range classification sounds so routine it certainly was not this year this year was the first time we 
 took the new rifle the 7 62 mm c l rifle to the ranges for formal classification using it on 
 the range simply proved once again that experience is the best teacher many were the soldiers who muttered to themselves 
 about the rifle until they got it balanced adjusting the gas to prevent kick but to permit ejection and return 
 by the time all companies had had the treatment it was generally agreed that the experts were right and the 
 new rifle is in fact quite superior to the old number 4 after the intelligence officer lt wh jones had 
 suceeded in making arrangements with various farmers and municipal authorities for the use of land for training section and platoon 
 tactics became the order of the day and despite the disadvantage of having the training areas between fifteen and twenty 
 odd miles from camp and being quite limited in size and variety of ground the tactical training was quite successful 
 and platoons started to feel like a knit team again at the end of april each of the rifle platoons 
 in turn competed in a platoon in the attack test the co lt col vr schjelderup with a small control 
 staff put the platoons through their paces and when it was all over he said he was sure there wasn 
 t a gopher hole that hadn t been found the exercise called for each platoon to deploy in a forward 
 assembly area complete deployment procedure plan and launch a quick attack and reorganize on the objective the pioneer platoon provided 
 a live enemy and in the eyes of the enemy no two attacks were the same judged on a comprehensive 
 point system covering all aspects of the exercise 2 platoon of a company commanded by lt now capt l durocher 
 and 6 platoon 
 the patrician 24 of b company commanded by sgt scott mj tied for the winning spot in first place the 
 above concluded the series of events and tests which were the battalion efficiency tests and from which a company with 
 capt ah constant as company commander and csm wo2 goodwin lg emerged the undisputed victor in nearly all fields training 
 summer concentration as june turned into july and after the clearing of a little bush the digging of a few 
 holes and the killing of a lot of mosquitoes 2 ppcli became comfortably established in tented bivouac on the northern 
 shore of border lake under patricia hill the beaches and cool water were appreciated by all when breaks in the 
 training allowed for their use this year was the sixth time the battalion has done its summer training at camp 
 wainwright and as in previous years the period was organized into three phases phase i unit training phase 2 controlled 
 by the commander 1 canadian infantry brigade and phase 3 controlled by the general officer commanding western command however before 
 the beginning of any phase came pachino day which is reported upon separately under sports later in this report phase 
 1 was quite a diversified period and contained a number of highlights not the least of these was the extensive 
 training of the new recce platoon formed in the spring under the command of capt w dechant as a new 
 component in the battalion organization the platoon was able to conduct several trials while preparing for its important role of 
 battlefield surveillance over the large gaps of empty ground between units in later and larger scale exercises another different aspect 
 of phase 1 was the introduction of a troop of armoured personnel carriers apcs in the absence of a proper 
 apc which is still under development thirteen ton standard military pattern trucks had their boxes lined with mattresses to cushion 
 the shock of cross country mobile rock and roll and were turned over to sgt wabaska a used during company 
 exercises to practice the tactical employment of apcs word soon got around that every section commander was acting like a 
 rommel and that the strathcona s would soon have to look out rather than quelling this attitude the addition of 
 a 30 cal mg to each vehicle helped to enhance it apc training was indeed popular and helped raise already 
 high spirits phase 1 also contained three battalion level exercises the first of these exercise shakedown was a study of 
 the battalion s ability to pack load and move using only the new light scale of vehicles loaded entirely in 
 seventy six jeeps the only simulation necessary was the trailer load scale of first line ammunition reserves the next battalion 
 exercise was exercise moonlight during which the emphasis was on night movement 0:move 0:ment and navigation under full moon and 
 good weather conditions it was almost possible to map use by moonlight this may account for the difficulty the enemy 
 in this case the recce platoon had in surprising 0:sur 0:prising the company s in ambush there is no denying 
 that the enemy had a hey day and prisoners were taken by both sides this exercise 
 the patrician 25 exercise quick thought 111 was followed by exercise mosquito hawk which was a practice in movement deployment 
 and the passage of information during phase 1 the brigade company group exercise was conducted for all rifle companies of 
 1 ppcli 2 ppcli and 1 qor of c this was exercise quick thought 111 each company group consisted of 
 a rifle company mortar section mmg section anti tank detachment tank troop artillery foo party and an engineer recce party 
 the exercise opened with a five mile approach march and went immediately into pursuit operations which culminated in a company 
 attack a company commanded 0:com 0:manded by capt ah constant added to the many laurels it had already won by 
 winning this competitive exercise too it would be wrong to leave phase 1 without making special mention of the pioneer 
 course which was conducted for all the western command pioneer platoons by 3fd sqn rce this course warrants special mention 
 because of the competition conducted at the end of it which was won by our pioneer platoon another first place 
 award for 2 ppcli at the end of phase 1 heavy inroads were made upon the battalion strength as we 
 were called upon to provide several officers ncos and men for the control and umpire and general duty staffs for 
 the exercises to follow however companies were maintained at a reasonable strength but at times the machinery creaked from the 
 weaknesses created by these demands the static tented camp was struck on completion of phase 1 and the battalion became 
 completely operational for the remainder of the collective training period phase 2 was a five day two sided exercise exercise 
 powerglide it opened with the companies moving in to occupy a brigade defensive position by night concurrently with a fifty 
 odd mile night vehicle convoy move 
 the patrician 26 as can be imagined readily such an amount of movement over roads and tracks that had already 
 been ground to flour fine dust during previous days resulted in everyone becoming well and truly coated with layers of 
 dust and dirt they could have well done without a condition which was to last all through powerglide with first 
 and second patricias as friendly forces and first queen s own as the ignoble fantasion enemy the exercise developed through 
 two successive night withdrawals during which both tracked and wheeled vehicles became bogged repeatedly in bottomless sand occupation of intermediate 
 and main defensive positions during which the theme was hide once found you re dead and patrolling and more patrolling 
 soon however the god of war was good to us and we went on the offensive after a rapid river 
 crossing over the battle river the operation developed as a mobile advance deep into enemy territory b company which took 
 the battalion phases 1 2 and 3 objectives had just seen the other companies pass through when an atomic bomb 
 knocked b company out of action a nice four hour rest the rest of the battalion pushed on taking a 
 number of enemy personnel and vehicles prisoner en route until a major obstacle an umpire created demolition and radioactive area 
 brought it to a halt recovering rapidly the co had the battalion retrace its route a few miles and press 
 on with the advance down a new axis this suceeded with such speed that the commander of the enemy force 
 co 1 qor of c complete with fantasian dress and his senior artillery commander were captured at their hq a 
 fitting note on which the exercises ended phase 3 the closing phase exercise was the general officer commanding s 0:com 
 0:manding 0:s exercise hotfoot 11 testing the brigade groups ability to occupy a defensive position withdraw advance patrol and assault 
 across a water obstacle we saw little of the enemy until the closing hours of the exercise with the frequent 
 long rapid on foot movement demanded by the exercise it proved quite a test of the endurance of the brigade 
 the battalion not only survived but the high spirited fit men of the companies seemed to excel under the arduous 
 conditions of the exercise on the final morning of the exercise both patricia battalions attacked across the ribstone creek hoping 
 at last to close with the enemy they were not disappointed in a desperate attempt to drive us back across 
 the river the queen s own still in the fantasian role counter attacked but without success we were credited with 
 knocking out ten enemy tanks and fifteen apcs with the bridge head still secure and the enemy still in close 
 contact the cease fire was given and the collective training period 1958 was ended although phase 3 was over the 
 summer camp was not and after settling in a concentration area for a quick clean up and to begin preparation 
 0:pre 0:paration to leave wainwright all ranks of first and second patricias assembled under the stars for much hand shaking 
 back slapping battle post mortems and general end of summer revelry in a full scale regimental smoker and a large 
 gay evening it was on 29 jul 58 the battalion returned to the hamilton gault barracks said hello to wives 
 and children and friends sorted out equipment collected passes pay and tickets and went on 30 days leave plus travel 
 time 
 the patrician 27 special events early may was devoted to intensive training for the general officer commanding s goc inspection 
 14 may 58 because we had not had the new c l rifle very long the biggest work load fell 
 upon the rsm wol j coutts directing the arms drill under bright sunny skies the inspection was carried off in 
 the usual steady manner before major general c yokes cbe dso cd following the goc s inspection all efforts were 
 directed toward preparations for the trooping the colour and the visit of brigadier a hamilton gault dso ed cd which 
 is reported upon separately in this volume two guards of honour were provided by the battalion during may one with 
 major lw basham as guard commander and csm wo2 mcmahon aj as guard csm was provided for the annual ceremony 
 of the edmonton branch of the ppcli association at the city cenotaph the other was provided in honour of major 
 general c yokes cbe dso cd at the opening of the edmonton horse show on 14 may this guard was 
 commanded by major jh meisner and the guard csm was csm wo2 goodwin lg immediately following the trooping the colour 
 the battalion received some 175 militia officers and men to conduct their summer camp for them instead of conducting separate 
 infantry militia summer camps as such this year for the first time members of the militia were attached to regular 
 army units for training and administration for one week the week s activities were organized and supervised by major or 
 browne and the instructional staff for the various courses which were run was found from within the battalion militia personnel 
 arrived from the winnipeg grenadiers 1 north saskatchewan regiment 2 north saskatchewan 0:saskat 0:chewan regiment south saskatchewan regiment and the 
 loyal edmonton regiment 3 ppcli non qualification courses to assist militia in b company parade in downtown edmonton 
 the patrician 28 structure qualification courses for infantry specialty up grading and nco and officer qualification courses for up grading 
 in rank were conducted 0:con 0:ducted within the hamilton gault barracks at winterburn and at the unit training area some 
 fifteen miles from camp it was not all work and no play though and an illustration is the fast ball 
 game between 2 ppcli and the winnipeg grenadiers fortunately the game was called on account of rain and none too 
 soon the game was marked with such things as a batter running to third base because first base had a 
 man on already and i didn t want to risk knocking him out on a forced run all units of 
 the militia who came have commented most favourably on their week and are glad they came we enjoyed having them 
 too training in wainwright was interrupted for b company when under command of major or browne with csm wo2 melnechuk 
 m the company came to edmonton to participate with the corps of drums in the edmonton exhibition parade with the 
 drums in full dress and the company in operational dress and arms this component of the battalion made a very 
 impressive entry in the parade and drew a considerable amount of public comment corps of drums during the many and 
 varied activities participated in by the drums in the last six months the commendable comments indicate the effort put into 
 each parade by all members of the band some of the main features for the year were the celebration of 
 princess patricia s birthday on 17 march followed by kapyong day on 25 apr when all members of the battalion 
 took part in a parade to commemorate 0:com 0:memorate the battle of kapyong during the month of may we had 
 several parades the commemoration 0:commemora 0:tion of frezenberg the annual horse show army day and the canadian legion convention held 
 at the prince of wales armouries the buglers of the corps of drums played a retreat ceremony at the jubilee 
 auditorium which turned out very well in addition there were passing out parades for junior nco school at camp wainwright 
 and for our own regimental depot parades to accompany the play off games for our very fine regimental hockey team 
 and the edmonton exhibition parade on 14 july highlights of the year s program was of course the trooping of 
 the colour and the british columbia centennial searchlight tattoo at vancouver s empire stadium the tattoo was the largest of 
 its kind in the world with over nine hundred participants it featured bands from the uk canada and the usa 
 the show was produced and directed by brigadier jock mac lean cbe retired of the queen s own cameron highlanders 
 drum major taylor wa has left for a course in the east and in his absence the corps of drums

 that the team results will show even greater dividends

 the patrician 47 the rifle brigade the green jackets brigade as a consequence of the recent defence white paper considerable 
 changes are taking place within the british army it may be of interest to you readers to hear how this 
 will affect the allied regiment in general terms it is planned to cease the call up of national servicemen 0:service 
 0:men in 1960 and to consequently trim the army down from a strength of over 400 000 to around 165 
 000 within the infantry this will necessitate reducing the number of infantry battalions by amalgamations and discharging 0:dis 0:charging a 
 considerable number of senior officers the intention moreover is to develop a new sense of loyalty and administrative convenience by 
 the formation of territorial brigades these brigades are not expected to serve operationally but are designed to co ordinate the 
 resources of the battalions whose recruiting areas are adjacent and will make more economical use of the senior officers and 
 ncos and share a joint brigade depot in order to cement the relationship battalions will be numbered within the new 
 brigade rather than within the original regiments and a unified brigade cap badge will be worn the rifle brigade has 
 in fact been brigaded with the king s royal rifle corps as the green jackets brigade with a depot at 
 winchester for many years however it was decided that this two battalion brigade was too small by comparison with the 
 new formations and a further battalion has therefore been added thus the green jackets have welcomed the oxfordshire and buckinghamshire 
 light infantry 43 and 52nd into the brigade and the official designation of the battalions will now be as under 
 ist green jackets 43rd and 52nd 2nd green jackets king s royal rifle corps 3rd green jackets the rifle brigade 
 
 48 there will be a parade at the green jackets depot on 6 nov 58 taken by hrh the duke 
 of gloucester to mark the formation of the new brigade the changes involved in the new system will include crossposting 
 0:cross 0:posting of field officers and warrant officers between battalions as vacancies occur and certain alterations in dress and nomenclature 
 notably that the 43rd and 52nd will wear black buttons and will restyle their private soldiers as riflemen for many 
 regiments the amalgamations and brigading have meant sad breaks with tradition the green jackets are therefore most fortunate in having 
 so few alterations to accept and are both proud and delighted to be joined by the 43rd and 52nd with 
 whom so many battle honours were shared in the famous light division in the peninsula war the following letter was 
 received from captain me carleton smith the rifle brigade allied regiment exchange officer the historic associations and close comradeship that 
 led to the affiliation between the princess patricia s canadian light infantry and the rifle brigade have now once again 
 borne fruit it is twenty one years since the last exchange of officers took place when lt col harry cotton 
 spent two years with the rifle brigade in england whilst john gordon duff served in canada thus as only the 
 second officer from my regiment to serve on exchange with the patricias i feel both deeply privileged and happy to 
 be granted this most exceptional opportunity sailing from southampton in the comfort of a cunard liner at the end of 
 july set the pattern for a journey that was ultimately to consume six weeks of travel steeped in entertainment and 
 interest after a week s leave in new york i reported for duty at ottawa at this stage colonel wilson 
 smith rather than hasten my departure westwards arranged a series of most instructive visits to camp borden kingston and petawawa 
 before returning to montreal to pay my respects to brigadier and mrs hamilton gault in their beautiful new home in 
 due course i motored to edmonton to receive the most wonderful welcome from the 2nd battalion and depot when inundated 
 with invitations of a sporting nature and overwhelmed with hospitality the original three day visit became extended to ten three 
 days duck shooting with the goc s party at wainwright followed by two days fishing at jasper completed 0:com 0:pleted 
 the stay before leaving for victoria for the seven thousand odd miles of this outward journey from england new found 
 acquaintances had extolled the merits of victoria b c consequently it would have been easy to have become disappointed however 
 such was not the case and victoria has already far exceeded the most ambitious expectations the ease with which the 
 long haired englishman has been absorbed into the extremely happy comradeship rhe patrician 
 the patrician of the ist battalion speaks for itself such was the hospitality and kindness displayed by all concerned that 
 i was almost immediately able to feel completely at home only the salmon for some time refused to extend the 
 same co operation however they too have now accepted a rifle green bucktail as acceptable bait meanwhile however an amusingly 
 bewildered csm of d company bears the full brunt of converting or being converted by the black buttoned newcomer in 
 conclusion may i take this opportunity to express my gratitude both for the opportunity and the wonderful time that has 
 been my lot and also to convey the regards and greetings of all ranks of the rifle brigade to all 
 patricia s and finally add that any serving or past patrician is expected to visit the regimental depot at winchester 
 hampshire and the battalion wherever it may be serving whenever they are in the vicinity princess patricia s canadian light

 the patrician 56 this letter was received from major general carl cson van horn chief of staff united nations truce 
 supervision organization jerusalem dear colonel schjelderup i should like to express to all ranks of the princess patricia s canadian 
 light infantry my sincere expression of sympathy in your loss of lieutenant colonel george a flint cd this officer was 
 carrying out his duty as my personal representative for mount scopus he had in fact been connected with mount scopus 
 since 1956 and had as you know sustained a serious wound in a mine incident on mount scopus in july 
 1956 his work dealing as it did with the peaceful solution to the many problems that arose in connection with 
 mount scopus was a sometime thankless but nonetheless most important task colonel flint carried out these duties in a straight 
 forward conscientious and impartial manner his services were so valued that the secretary general recently made a special request that 
 his services be retained for an additional year this in itself speaks for the high regard in which the services 
 of this officer were held colonel flint was fatally wounded whilst in the act of attempting to arrange for the 
 evacuation of some wounded men on the slopes of mount scopus his courage is an inspiration to all of us 
 serving with the united nations truce supervision organization in palestine the regiment should be very proud of this canadian officer 
 i attended the burial service in the imperial war grave cemetery at moascar near ismailia a service was held with 
 full military honours and the body was laid to rest with eight of his fellow country men i believe that 
 everything was in accordance with the way the regiment would have wished it i have already expressed my condolences to 
 mrs flint and her two daughters they have left on 1 june for montreal i speak for all members of 
 untso when i express the hope that we may one day achieve the peace so long sought after by this 
 gallant patrician yours very sincerely signed carl cson yon horn major general chief of staff 
 the patrician 57 province of alberta the alcajv highway there are strange things done in the midnight sun by the 
 men who moil for gold the arctic trails have their secret tales that would make your blood run cold the 
 northern lights have seen queer sights but the queerest they ever did see was that night on the marge of 
 lake lebarge i cremated sam mcgee poet robert service carries on in the same boisterous vein to tell the story 
 of the cremation of sam mcgee you ve probably read it or some other poem written by robert service about 
 the north the alaska and yukon he knew and loved it was a place where men sweated athirst in its 
 summer froze and starved in its cold followed dreams by its thousand streams toiled and moiled for its gold today 
 the north has tamed down a bit and has become a place that canadian and americans can look forward to 
 visiting thanks to the alaska or alcan highway nowadays albertans can pack their families into cars and head north past 
 edmonton and dawson creek into territory once known only by the indians and prospectors the north hasn t yet been 
 conquered by man they ve hardly made a dent in it even with the alaska highway and towns scattered along 
 the road tall straight trees still march straight down to the highway lofty cloud crowned mountain peaks stretch above and 
 beyond the road clear mountain streams rush under its bridges alberta feels slightly responsible for this alaska highway through the 
 majestic north it was up alberta s own roads and over her railroad 0:rail 0:road lines that supplies were rushed 
 to help build this ribbon of highway some of alberta s young men joined the construction crews that helped push 
 it through many people are under the impression that the actual alcan highway begins at edmonton but it really extends 
 from the end of steel at dawson creek 8 c to fairbanks alaska and was born out of war during 
 the last great war the japanese were threatening the aleutians the enemy was moving closer to north america and this 
 continent was worried about its miles and miles of unprotected northland easy targets for an invading army canada and the 
 united states put their heads 
 the patrician 58 together on their problem of a need for common defence and as a result the alaska highway 
 was born supplies and men had to be sent to alaska and the yukon a railroad was out of the 
 question the country was far too wild and untamed a scenic paradise but a raidroad builder s nightmare grades would 
 have to be too steep and with the fall of the outlying aleutian islands danger was too imminent the supply 
 line had to be built as quickly as possible so the plan for an alaska highway were born a thin 
 ribbon of road thirty six feet wide stretching 1 523 miles a ribbon of defence for alaska and north america 
 in the early months of 1942 forces and supplies were mustered to begin the giant task of constructing the alaska 
 highway a construction force of 18 659 men 11 159 of whom were troops from seven united states engineer regiments 
 began work on a preliminary or tote road it was exactly for that purpose to tote equipment and supplies up 
 the preliminary road to finish the final job work was begun on the rough tote road in sections equipment and 
 men were hurried up to dawson creek on the northern alberta railroad owned jointly by the c n r and 
 c p r from there the equipment was put to work thrusting and pushing a snooping mechanized nose into the 
 wilderness of the north pushing the road hurriedly through more machinery and men were taken into alaska by boat which 
 followed the b c coastline north to seward and the quaint alaska railroad then put on the railroad which travels 
 as far as fairbanks alaska once in fairbanks machines and men set to work on the alaska highway while at 
 the same time other crews and machinery taken into the north from the coast by various rivers and lakes also 
 began work on the road against almost insurmountable odds the tote road was completed in nine months in november of 
 1942 after the tote road was completed in 1942 with the joining of construction from the north and construction from 
 the south at contact creek the united states army turned the job over to civilian construction crews an american crew 
 headed by construction man oaks and a canadian outfit headed by r melville smith went fifty fifty on construction 0:construc 
 0:tion of the alcan highway needless to say the contractors had quite a time keeping working crews one man in 
 charge of hiring employees for r melville smith once moaned i ve got three crews working on this highway one 
 is working now one is on its way home from the job and the other is on its way up 
 that was about it in construction camps along the highway the crews lived in camps thrown up beside the tote 
 road good barracks with good food but there was no amusement there and so some men their pay weighing heavily 
 in their pockets headed back to the bright lights of the cities a transportation system was needed to get these 
 men working on the alaska highway back and forth to the northern reaches so the american army made an agreement 
 with western canadian greyhound lines to attach some of their buses and personnel to the american army during building of 
 this alaska highway from 1943 to 1944 they were 
 the patrician 59 called the northwest command bus lines and consisted of around 150 men and from 12 to 15 
 buses headquarters for this new bus line were set up in dawson creek and because of the boom town conditions 
 head office was situated in a converted chicken coop across the lane was a trucking company whose office were located 
 in a converted livery stable one cold night in february a truck with sixty cases of dynamite for the telephone 
 line along the alaska highway was driven into the trucking garage for repairs the workmen left for supper and then 
 one of the little dramas of the alaska highway took place the blacksmith shop next to the livery stable caught 
 on fire spread quickly to the livery stable drew nearer and nearer to to truck loaded with dynamite then started 
 in to burn through the explosives which began popping off like immense firecrackers unfortunately the fire suddenly caught up with 
 a few crates of percussion caps also housed in the garage these went off and set the burning dynamite off 
 in a blast that shattered windows for miles and was heard in the neighboring town of puskapay burning timbers flew 
 through the air like flaming spears people were crushed by falling buildings and cut by flying glass as the business 
 section of dawson creek blazed brightly away shortly after the big dawson creek fire the first greyhound bus took off 
 along the rough tote road northward bound down a road scarcely ever travelled before with a load of army and 
 construction personnel plus a guide and two drivers so remote was the country and so new the alaska highway that 
 when the bus pulled into teslin bay ope day in 1943 troops being entertained down at the other end of 
 main street by a u s o troop on an army carry all left the entertainment to meet the bus 
 and the people it carried the people working on the alaska highway were in a way pioneers they helped build 
 this road through the north roughing it at times and putting up with the inconveniences of a new country water 
 for instance was a valuable commodity selling for 1 00 a barrel travellers of the alaska highway marvel at the 
 scenic grandeur of the country and return home to tell friends and neighbors about it those coming from the pacific 
 coast can take the new hart highway through british columbia to dawson creek but others from alberta east and south 
 find the shortest route is through edmonton over to dawson creek and north some visitors make this country their home 
 and some day these northern territories will be populated with settlers small towns will grow into large cities centres of 
 new industries then the oldtimers those who helped build the alaska highway will reminisce over the good old days and 
 point with pride to the north as robert service knew it and we ll realize those of us who are 
 spared to see it that some of us helped develop this brave new north the canadian army now maintains that 
 part of the alaska highway from dawson creek to the alaska border and works day and night winter and summer 
 to keep what is now called the northwest highway system 
 the patrician 60 in good condition headquarters for these men of the highway is in whitehorse under brigadier h c 
 love 0 8 e canadians such as these are holding the ribbon of northern highway against the ravages of time 
 doing their best to keep the north open they probably feel as do albertans that some day the old saying 
 go west young man go west will become go north young man go north editor s note the foregoing article
