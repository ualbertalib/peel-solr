 on many of those same by ranches 2 from knowledgeable work mate to gentle friend the horse was an integral
 part of n a n cy you n g the successful adaptation of ranchwomen to their new lives on ranches

 to live on a ranch in southern alberta the majority of these ranchwomen were her mother had taken care to
 ensure her british emigrants who belonged to the middle daughter acquired what she believed would to upper middle class those
 who were not be necessary and important skills for a wife in british originated primarily from the canadian west accordingly
 she had communities in established areas of canada enrolled hughes in a domestic science school especially ontario and quebec these

 patriarchal society firmly shirts and the glossing iron were packed away entrenched in victorian ideals as to the in a

 of them knowledge of alberta was the challenges she had experienced and the sparse and inaccurate preparations for rural pride
 she had felt in learning a new skill since life were often inappropriate perceptions and her arrival she could now
 ride a horse expectations often differed greatly from the realities of the land climate and living much has been written
 on the history of the conditions in the canadian west men who ranched in early alberta within that history lie
 horse has been clearly during the period 1880 to 1914 horses were depicted as a tool used to work those
 ranches readily available in alberta one could buy a as a product of some of those ranches and as pony
 from the natives for two to three necessary recreational equipment for those dollars or choose from one of the numerous
 men yet relatively unrecognized to date has ranches that raised horses as well as cattle 2 above a woman riding

 in 1905 alberta history winter 2004 u for those expecting nothing less than a pure thoroughbred or other such top
 quality breed there were ranches that specialized in breeding horses as fine as any one could find in an upper
 class english stable horses were easy to care for and inexpensive to keep even in the winter 9 horses provided
 the essential rorm of transportation in early alberta where ranches occupied vast tracts of land and were located at great
 distance from one another they were reliable whatever the weather apart from being ridden they were used to pull an
 assortment of modes of transport such as democrats buggies and wagons essential to utilization of the horse was of course
 the knowledge of either or both driving and riding the vast majority of men who were engaged in ranching were
 able to ride or at least knew the basics of driving a team of horses however for their wives such
 knowledge and experience was by no means a pre requisite for living on a ranch the more fortunate women arrived
 in southern alberta already familiar with horses and clearly experts in horsemanship skills one of these was evelyn cochrane wife
 of prominent rancher billy cochrane she had learned to i ide in england and was well known as an expert
 and fearless horsewoman other women were encouraged to learn some basics before they left england claude gardiner owner of the
 wineglass ranch near pincher creek wrote in 1895 concerning the pending arrival of his mother and his sister can bab
 ride yet bab must ride if she ever wants to leave the house as one cannot walk any distance especially
 a woman on account of the cattle many women did not have previous riding experience when they arrived but they
 quickly realized the advantages of riding and resolved to learn mrs wilson was timid had always been delicate and pampered
 she was afraid of horses she realized if she were to live in the country she must learn to ride
 after she had ambled around the ranch buildings for a while she started to town the horse was stubborn and
 when she got away from home he insisted on turning back she could do nothing with him at first but
 she stayed with him until she became master 2 ranchwoman monica hopkins recorded that her previous riding experiences had been
 limited to donkeys at the seaside and a plough horse on a farm she began her training by trotting between
 the house and stable hitting and missing the saddle at every movement of the horse her first real ride was
 sixteen miles it looks easy but oh my dear after my long ride i thought i would never walk again
 5 numerous other recollections of early women mention the necessity of learning to ride and describe their efforts to accomplish
 this task 4 it was not easy as they were encumbered with long skirts and using a sidesaddle would have
 been most difficult although one old timer recalled that everyone rode horseback in those days 5 some women never did
 learn this always left them at a disadvantage noted one ranchwoman kate showed me how to can beef and chicken
 but i rarely see her she cannot leave her family and i cannot ride maybe after the baby comes i
 will be more brave about trying 5 said another those who do not ride and are dependent on their men
 folk to take them about evidently do not get taken out much i ve decided i m not going to
 be dependent on anyone so i ride nearly every day her observation of a neighbour who did not ride was
 that she never left her house for months at a time 7 the ability to ride and or drive a
 team endowed a ranchwoman with significant rewarding to participate in men s work for women who were raised in a
 society that viewed them as capable only of tasks related to children marriage and the home yet had they not
 known how to ride engaging in ranch work would not have been possible the ability to ride seems to have
 led to acceptance by men working on a ranch one woman wrote that the cowboys supported her attempts to live
 in a civilized manner and indeed back me in all my schemes because i ride well i verily believe if
 i didn t ride they would have nothing to do with me as it is they are rather proud of
 me 2 another noted that while she cut out her first steer the herd old boys were all watching to
 see how i made out which must have met with their approval and satisfaction because after that they really put
 me to work whenever i went to the roundup 24 the ability to connect with men both in task and
 conversation horse talk would advantages an examination of some of the activities in which they participated and the undoubtedly have
 helped to fill the void resultant affect this had on their physical and created by the lack of female companionship
 mental health clearly shows that the advantages were numerous for a woman in the west interest in her husband s
 pursuits was vital 25 thus a although some historians have claimed that ranchwoman s involvement in ranch work ranchwomen did
 very little outside of the might have strengthened her marriage to house 8 there is evidence to prove the communicate
 knowledgeably about the tasks contrary violet pearl sykes arrived at the the men the horses and the dreams for the
 milk river ranch in 1907 initially she was future of the ranch would surely have been of assigned to go
 out to get the mail but before great benefit to a husband and wife no doubt long she was put
 to work helping herd cattle many a husband was also very proud of a having proved herself she was regularly
 wife who could ride well included in the round up during the winter when only a few ranch hands were
 employed riding the range was enjoyable for she helped drive the cattle out to feed she ranchwomen but it could
 entail significant eventually married bronc buster emery dangers hopkins wrote that she had been up legrandeur with whom she trained
 horses at in the pasture running in some saddle horses numerous ranches 5 when five yards ahead of me was
 a black bear coming towards me 25 a mrs bryce in mary inderwick who ranched with her the high river
 area who liked to ride and husband charles on the north fork ranch in help out on the ranch had
 an unforgettable the pincher creek area from 1883 to 1888 experience wrote of the exciting rides helping drive the cattle
 2 pioneer interviews and local histories she enjoyed chasing the steers down to mention a number of women who worked
 water at a large slough first thing she did alongside their husbands on the ranch 2 was ride to the
 slough and chop a hole in the noteworthy is the fact that when world war ice then she went for
 the cattle one one began and husbands volunteered for war morning she thought this a waste of time so duties
 sonic of these women were left to she took the cattle down the first trip she manage the ranch on
 their own which they had gotten off her horse to chop the hole did very capably 22 it must have
 been when she looked up and to her horror saw a mary inderwick was the wife of the owner of
 the north fork ranch in the 1880 s she loved riding she described galloping at breakneck speed where a false
 step would end in disaster but joy her horse never makes it u alberta history winter 2004 stampede of steers
 coming straight for her the animals were not used to seeing anyone on foot fortunately she climbed on her horse
 in time then had to chase the cattle away and go back to chop the hole in the ice river
 crossings could be treacherous especially in the spring winter storms prairie fires wild animals and aggressive bulls were all forces
 with which a rider had to learn to reckon a ranchwoman going out on her own required courage but the
 conquering of fears may have instilled confidence in women who had hitherto led very protected lives mary inderwick described a
 run in with some bulls in a narrow coulee they stood pawing and growling and looking harm in a way
 that would have appalled me had i been on the highest hill on foot but having joy under me i
 cared for nothing 28 elsewhere in the same letter she speaks about helping to bring in some horses such confidence
 she has in her horse that she rides at breakneck speed where a false step would end in disaster but
 joy never makes it 29 if lost a ranchwoman could always count on her faithful horse to get her home
 commented sykes being new to the prairies and not knowing my directions many a time i just wrapped the reins
 around the saddle horn and let sammy pick his own way home both sykes and hopkins tell of being caught
 out near a fire and praise their reliable horses for finding their way home through darkness and smoke he didn
 t fail remembered sykes events such as picnics auctions and agricultural fairs were all attended eagerly by ranchwomen who enjoyed
 them both for their value as a change from their regular routine and as a long awaited opportunity to socialize
 with other females polo and horse racing were immensely popular spectator sports the horse occupying the dual role of transport
 to and participant in the event the social events that followed these events such as teas and balls were greatly
 enjoyed by women 5 during the winter for many a time of great discomfort and unhappiness community dances dinners and
 socials were some of the one of the popular equestrian activities in which women either participated or observed was coyote
 hunting this view shows coyote hunters at the sanderson farm near midnapore in the early 1900 s mrs dudley smith
 is at far right alberta history winter 2004 n ranches were often the sites for gymkhanas events in which informal
 contests for children women and men of varying degrees of riding ability were held 58 women riders also participated in
 horse shows in the larger centres often held as part of the celebrations for special events such as dominion day
 women riding sidesaddle sometimes participated in jumping classes in pairs additional thrilling events to watch were those such as the
 first calgary stampede in 1912 although the female riders were all american the costumes the roping and the trick riding
 displayed were amazing and perhaps motivating sights to see 7 because ranchwomen craved female companionship outings to visit other women
 popular events books and articles about ranching and sport in early alberta detail many of the above activities and their
 importance to the ranching community 2 yet there remain some lesser known areas of involvement of the ranchwoman and her
 horse in leisure pursuits although largely dominated by men there is evidence that hunting coyotes was one very popular sport
 in which women were involved as participants as well as spectators to engage in hunting on a horse particularly in
 the early days when a sidesaddle was expected of women would have required being a competent rider none could imitate
 mrs billy cochrane once she was away there were few of us who could keep up with her 34 for
 those women who were involved in the hunt only as spectators the sight of fellow females participating as equals with
 men as they raced across the countryside must have been inspiring were not only enjoyable leisure but grass and hear
 the dear creak of the saddle additionally a vital necessity for mental well notable was inderwick s later mention of
 being to reach other women in early alberta riding as a method for her to deal with stress one was
 reliant on the horse recollections when jerry breaks my best cut glass dish i tell of women riding alone women
 riding fly to the stables and have my joy saddled and with their husbands or women being driven ride till
 i know that cut glass is nothing to by their husbands 8 the need for outings to make or mar

 were used as a means whereby english activities had been organized women new to the canadian west could engage in

 however close examination of her very happy while doing it diary reveals that although she was often sad and morose
 there were nonetheless good days pioneer interviews also tell of children who when she went riding on the range or
 went on had no toys and relied on the horse for play outings by horseback to visit people and fun
 4 one woman described the enjoyment her daughters had riding on their even in later years women still yearned for
 ponies other stories recount women leaving female companionship hopkins justified her the house to go riding putting the children action

 miles away to fetch the station agent s wife for ranchwomen who were unmarried knowledge about the horse as well
 as the ability to ride was essential miss jessie reoch arrived from scotland to visit friends in the high river
 area in 1888 deciding to stay she ran her own cattle on the little bow 2 another ranchwoman from the
 same district never married but remained on the family ranch and raised cattle and horses lady ernestine hunt described as
