 unmarked grave of a blood chief who upon his death in 1901 carried with him one of the strangest secrets
 of the canadian west the man was calf shirt or onistahsi sokasim his secret was a strange power which permitted
 him to talk to rattlesnakes calf shirt was a paradox for in 57 years of life he played with equal
 dexterity the roles of informer and tribal leader police scout and cr iminal but his power over rattlesnakes was his
 strangest trait a gift of his own religion this power came to him when he was 36 years old just
 before the bloods and their blackfoot allies began to exper ience the bitterness of life on a reserve and to
 hunger for the vanished buffalo calf shirt s ca reer was filled with adventure even in the years before his
 strange control over while the battle was in progress in time to see the crees being trapped in a long

 only with his bear knife and singing his war song calf shirt rushed the men but took an rattlesnakes he
 had had an eventful life born in i 844 the son of the shoulder he was a member of the
 many tumors band and earned a favorable reputation as a warrior after one particular experience he took the name of
 calf shirt which had belonged to an uncle killed by whiskey traders during the winter of 1873 74 names were
 considered to be family possessions which could be claimed after some particular achieveruent or event calf shirt did his best
 to live up to his name he joined several war parties mostly against the crows in montana nd became so
 highly regarded that he was a leader of revenge war parties these were formed whenever the bloods suffered humiliating defeat
 at the hands of an enemy he took part in a great battle between the crees and blackfoot near the
 present city of lethbridge in the fall of 1870 he had been out hunting and upon his return was told
 by his father that the battle was in progress the young warrior let his father daub bright war paint on
 his face and as a gesture of scorn promised that should he be struck by an enemy arrow he would
 leave it in his body for his father to remove grasping a double bladed knife from his religious bear medicine
 bundle calf shirt arrived arrow in the wrist before he reached them heedless of the shaft protruding from his arm
 the warrior grabbed the bow with his wounded hand and struck the tall cree a mortal blow with his knife
 the calf skinned comrade waiting for a clear shot was stabbed to death in a similar manner mr dempsey is

 and monographs dealing with the blackfoot tribes above is a portrait of calf shirt and one of his snakes about

 the indian agent needed chiefs who became greatly swollen until he could not travel would co operate in matters of
 farming and unaided but when he still refused to remove the rationing even if these wishes were not always in

 was waiting to take calf shirt also knew that medicine calf could out the shaft not live many more years
 and if outside influence according toelderly bloods calf shirt receiv was not used strangling wolf would become ed his special
 rattlesnake powers through a vision sole leader of the band in the late i 870 s the event occurred shortly
 after the warrior s first move took place at the calf shirt s father had died and the young warrior

 on his death bed the agent bloods were camped in a rattlesnake infested later explained to his superiors that calf

 his called where we drowned calf shirt walked honesty i was in a position to refuse paying a aimlessly in
 his sorrow until at last he laid down number of south peigans representing themexhausted on a sand hill and fell
 asleep while selves to be bloods through services rendered there he had a dream in which a person appeared this
 indian has got the ill will of all the blood tribe before him i ve heard you mourning the loss
 of i may state that of his own free will he your father and have taken pity on you said
 the reduced his family three souls 2 stranger my father has sent me to you to say that you ll
 be his son and we ll be brothers all of this statement was based on the government s our people
 who live here are his children and belief that indians resorted to the wholesale you re now one of us
 you ll become a leader of padding of ration lists claiming to have more your people and we ll watch
 over you always persons in their families than was the fact this carry some sagebrush with you so that we
 ll know believed the indian agent often was accomyou and so you can use it to treat those who are
 plished by borrowing friends children and sick dressing them so they would not be recognized in his dream calf shirt
 could see the person during treaty and ration payments but still did not recognize him realizing this the after the
 death of medicine calf in october figure explained i m from the big snake tribe 1884 calf shirt vigorously pursued
 his plan of our people are rattlesnakes when you die you ll action three months later he reported to the
 become one of us agent that white men were selling alcohol to the returning to his home camp calf shirt
 soon bloods in the form of jamaica ginger essence demonstrated his newly gained powers grasp and pain killer then during
 the 1885 riel ing a rattlesnake he wrapped it around his waist rebellion he kept the agent informed of all
 carried it before a shocked group of bloods and activities rumours and gossip among the played with it as though
 it were achild at first his bloods as well as intelligence of any runners or friends shunned him for they
 feared the rattling visitors from other tribes this concentrated serpents but in time they learned that they had program of
 helping the indian agent had the nothing to fearas the snakes were his brothers and desired effect for in the
 summer of 1885 calf did his bidding if he whistled they slithered shirt was made a minor chief to replace
 the through the grass to his feet if he made a sign deceased medicine calf they quietly slipped away once
 appointed calf shirt knew the agent by the time the bloods settled on their reserve would have a hard time
 deposing him so the in 1881 calf shirt had become a prominent astute blood promptly abandoned his policy of member
 of the tribe he was not a chief for the co operation he had used the indian agent for many
 tumors were then under the leadership of his own advantage and now was prepared to rethe aged medicine calf and
 a younger brother sume a position of prestige among his people strangling wolf but calf shirt was an ambitious his
 first opportunity came late in 1886 when man and to gain the coveted role of chief he the bloods learned
 that six of their men had been chose to turn his back on his people and become killed and scalped
 by assiniboine indians in gift into a profitable enterprise as early as 1881 he was a visitor to fort macleod
 where he collected money for performing tricks with a large snake on one such visit a local newspaper man wrote
 that calf shirt is the snake charmer of the blood branch and the great blackfoot nation and he handles the
 deadly rattlesnake with the most consummate indifference to the awful absolute death that is contained in its slender fangs he
 keeps it coiled round his body next to the skin inside the shirt where it lovingly nestles and anyone who
 is willing to pay for his curiosity can see him put his hand in and drag the living writhing death
 out calf shirt claims continued the writer to have some subtle power over snakes and to see him take his
 present specimen up she measuring about three feet long catch it by the neck and cram about eight inches of
 it the deadliest reptile in america head downwards down his throat is calculated to make the marrow in any man
 s bones shiver he also puts it out on the ground and playfully pats it on the back of the
 head with his fingers till the snake rattles as if it was performing for the benefit of all the babies
 in canada it is not a pleasant sight for one with weak nerves and who understands what a rattlesnake is
 in 1888 calf shirt broke away from the many tumors band and retaining his chieftainship formed a new band called
 the crooked backs he and about 40 followers left the main blood camps on the belly river and settled on
 the northern tip of the reserve just across the river from leth bridge the location had two good features for
 the snake loving chief for it was close to the only supply of rattlers on the reserve and was almost
 on the outskirts of the coal mining town calf shirt soon became friends of the shopkeepers and regularly earned money
 by performing with his venomous pets but the chief also had problems for his camp being so near the town
 was a convenient focal point for prostitution to discourage this demoralizing practise the government had forbidden the indians from entering
 any white settlements unless they had passes however the location of calf shirt s camp made it easy for female
 members of the tribe to slip into town in the evening or for whites to come out the situation was
 observed by the indian agent who said that the authorities in lethbridge will not allow indians to stay in the
 town consequently these calf shirt often entertained people in lethbridge fort maclend and other places with his uncanny ability to
 handle rattlesnakes he is seen here in the 1890 s montana these included three of calf shirt s close relatives
 as a ripple of excitement swept through the camps the once peaceful calf shirt stirred the young people into action
 he organized a revenge party of some two hundred warriors just as he had in the buffalo days and was
 prepared to lead them out against their enemy when an autumn snowstorm cut short his plan continued cold weather made
 the raid impractical and before the snows had melted in the spring the blood elders had made a peace treaty
 with their old enemies in the following winter of 1887 88 calf shirt displayed his disregard for the white man
 s law when he smuggled a supply of whiskey onto the reserve from montana then sitting placidly in his tepee
 he bragged that the mounted police were afraid to arrest him however he was wrong and was sentenced to one
 month in fort macleod guardhouse during these years calf shirt continued to live with his snakes and to turn his
 remarkable indians having good looking squaws want to get on another occasion a rancher brought a live as near lethhridge
 as possible so that they can run rattler into lethbridge to show the townspeople back and forth the clerk at
 the hudson s bay company store to combat the problem calf shirt was saw it as a unique attraction so
 he bought the appointed a scout for the north west mounted reptile and put it on display but no sooner
 had the police during the time he held this position he snake been placed in the rudely constructed cage fought
 to keep the undesirables out of his camp than it escaped and disappeared into a stock of dry and succeeded
 to some extent in stamping out goods prostitution as a scout he also mixed with white frightened everyone fled from
 the store and people more than any other blood chief and his the clerk did not know what to do
 until someone facility for handling snakes was enough to grant suggested calf shirt the scout was summoned him respectful attention
 from his non indian and agreeing on a price for his services he went audience into the store poked around
 the counters and one day when a circus featuring a lady snake finally found the missing reptile curled up in
 charmer came to lethbridge calf shirt was some cotton goods he picked up the frightened urged by residents of the
 town to see the show he creature and played with it while carpenters hurriwatched the entertainer pick up her de

 well known in her head calf shirt was unimpressed the western canada so when plans were made to townspeople who
 crowded the tent to see the hold a large territorial exhibition in regina in indian s reaction did not have
 long to wait for as 1895 the chief received an invitation to attend soon as the show was over he
 nonchalantly pull not only was he happy to make the long journey ed a venomous rattler one of his biggest
 out of with his pets but he confided to his friends that his shirt and offered it to the charmer
 the woman the capital city was close to the sand hills so he took one look at the beady eyed
 reptile scream might have a chance to pick up some new snakes ed and fled calf shirt snickered returned his

 that his four find a route from the upper yoho valley to field guides left him with the tent rope
 and kit bag and that would take less time to travel than the trail via that they sat down only
 after seven minutes on the emerald lake 36 whymper then decided to locate trail this episode caused whymper to record

 the amiskiwi valley and amiskiwi river rather the way they do not go on is heart returning to field to
 prepare for this venture breaking a camp was established on the col whymper met tom wilson who introduced him between
 mount whyte and pope s peak where to another british mountaineer james outram whymper took photographs and bearings after outram
 decided to accompany whymper and ascending mount st piran whymper suggested wilson provided one of his assistants tom that the
 popularity of lake louise could be martin to help find the route which had eluded enhanced by establishing a path
 to the top of the whymper 37 wilson later joined the party and in a gruelling seventeen hour hike guided
 whym whymper was unable to take the photographs he per and klucker across the kiwetinok pass down desired when the
 party arrived in field on the amiskiwi river and eventually to field august 24 peyto unloaded the equipment and a
 whymper was so impressed that he asked wilson heated exchange took place over his salary to join the group whenever
 he could further peyto threatened whymper with legal proceedmore whymper proposed the name wilson s ings and for his part
 whymper declared that he valley to designate the unexplored valley they would pay nothing until the case was heard a
 had crossed 38 on the other hand whymper was compromise was reached when peyto became not pleased with the work
 entrusted to pollinger less agitated and whymper gave him an extra ten and kaufmann and he claimed that they had
 done dollars 43 nothing to find a direct route from the upper yoho while this magnanimous gesture may have valley
 to the yoho valley placated bill peyto other incidents emerged to returning from field after his successful cir exasperate his
 former employer while in field cuit with wilson whymper sent pollinger and for example whymper went three times to the
 kaufmann out again accompanied by outram cpr station to telegraph a report of his activities the guides returned later without
 outram stat to r kerr passenger traffic manager in moning that they had lost sight of him upon his treal
 but he was unable to find the agent return outram said he had lost the guides and whymper had planned
 to climb mount stephen continued to the bottom of the valley adding that with pollinger and kaufmann but obviously he
 believed that horses could get through peyto wiser from past experiences they objected to was sent out to investigate and
 he reported horses carrying anything but trifles whymper was could make it provided that a way was cleared 39 unable
 to obtain porters and consequently this peyto was sent to field for more supplies and project had to be abandoned
 in the meantime while awaiting his return whymper outram outram with klucker and bossonay made a and the swiss guides
 spent some time climbing first ascent of cathedral mountain in august the party made first ascents on mounts in late
 august whymper made preparations des poilus collie marpole kerr hable iso for an excursion to the ice river valley ta

 too impressed with was disappointed that tom wilson would not the level of difficulty of climbs in the rockies or
 accompany the party because of illness the expertise required and commented that it was wilson however provided whymper with two
 foolish to ascend such mountains this caused of his best men robert campbell and tom mar whymper to make the
 following note as he tin the usual problems quickly emerged once was earning his bread and butter by going up
 camp was set up at the base of mount goodsir them i thought the remark was worthy of re whymper
 complained that the preparations were â€˜ 40 ta king too long and that the swiss guides did peyto returned with
 the supplies while nothing but smoke and loaf he claimed that they whymper and the others were climbing mount had
 conspired among themselves and mentioned collie when whymper returned to camp he all sorts of reasons why they should not
 climb found that four bottles of his precious beer were mount goodsir 47 two days later on september missing one
 of the swiss guides bossonay re 1 poor weather forced whymper to cancel his ported that peyto had also carried
 off a jar of attempt to ascend the mountain the weather did pickles 4 another confrontation with peyto took little
 to improve employer employee relationplace a few days later when the camp was being ships whymper noted that while campbell
 moved peyto was to wait until whymper return fished to feed the party the guides did absolutely ed from photographing
 the daly glacier but he nothing 48 decided to leave forcing whymper to abandon a short time later while on
 the south side of his photographic mission an angered whymper mount goodsir ca mpbell and the guides turned claimed that
 the expedition s expenses amount back leaving whymper to spend the night at a ed to 40 00 per diem
 and that he was entitled to previous bivouac whymper found some tinned recover that amount from peyto 42 on the
 return food but had no can opener to add to his misery journey to field peyto had gone ahead and
 set it began to snow and he had to construct a shelter up camp but not in the rea whymper
 had desig from old pieces of canvas around midnight his nated in front of takakkaw falls and again fire went
 out but later on hot embers ignited the no 2 came in less than an hour late a sa rcastic
 whymper note that something terrible was bound to happen from field whymper went to banff where he mischievously appeared at
 the cpr station with a young eagle in a cage he was going to donate the eagle to an aviary
 in vancouver nd informed the station agent that it should be sent there free of cha rge because company regulations
 stated that infants under five years of age were to be conveyed without charge the agent however did not accept
 that interpretation a nd charged whymper six dollars to send the bird and the cage as an express package 53
 after the departure of his four guides whymper attempted to secure the services of nother swiss guide edwa rd feuz
 sr for a period in excess of two weeks since feuz would not be remaining in canada for that long
 whymper had to give up his attempt to climb mount goodsir with him 54 in the mea ntime whymper met
 outra m who had just completed he first ascent of mount assiniboine with the assistance of the swiss guides christian
 hasler and christian bohren whymper planned to ascend mount wapta with hasler and bohren but rain forced he abandonment of
 this project and friction developed between patron and guides whymper claimed that he had brought a clea n towel for
 his own use but bohren used it first whymper noted however that hasler was attentive to the needs of his
 monsieur the inclement weather caused a further deterioration in relations two days after commenting on hasler s attentiveness whymper observed
 that both guides were sulking apparently because they had consumed all of the fresh meat a nd wanted more 56
 finally on september 24 whymper s party stood on the summit of mount wapta but this success failed to br
 ing about an improvement in relationships on the return journey whymper claimed that hasler had lost his senses in trying
 to kill a porcupine whymper went ahead of the guide and ignored him a nd soon got lost an hour
 later hasler passed by and an indignant whymper followed him out upon returning to field whymper prepared to resume his
 exploration of the ice river valley while supplies and equipment were being assembled whymper had the opportunity to observe the
 passage of h r h the duke of york whymper noted that no one seemed to come out of the
 first train carrying the governorgeneral and other notabilities and no cheer rose from the 200 people who had assembled associates
 campbell nd martin went out to the second train carrying the duke a nd his sister hunt and returned without
 having shot anything did not occasion a single cheer the duke and this prompted whymper to suspect that the most
 of his entourage got off the train and came only hunting they did was for minerals into the hotel whymper
 recorded that he prospecting for their own advantage at my avoided the royal party but that outram got in expense
 toward the end of october the party their way and was rewarded by being allowed to visited zinc valley and
 zinc city a deserted talk to them whymper qualified his observa prospectors camp which whymper described as tions with this

 on the warpath they held up several boys who were on their way from town and scared the lads by
 shooting off their revolvers and otherwise showing that they meant biz a young englishman also was gone through but in
 neither case did they get anything now it happened that the boys knew these bad men and accordingly when the
 would be bandits sobered up they got frightened and hastened off to the home of the boys to apologise the
 boys father dissembled with them he said he intended to do nothing feeling sure that it was a joke but
 his wife had been greatly alarmed and had written the police about it he therefore advised them to stay up
 in the foot hills for a period they took his advice and have gone off into hiding and are now

 would not have in reaching a small town and finally getting out recognized to the grounds to find no knife
 no tables smith had several suggestions for improving suitable no chair to rest upon and nothing to women s sections
 in fairs she recommended screen food from flies 9 more teams of girls judging bread or ca ke here judging
 skills employed were often very the model was the junior livestock judging tea m pr imitive food exhibits were seldom
 tasted or where perhaps four members would rate a group even smelled and many local exhibitors expected of animals of
 the same breed and then write the the judge to decide on appearances alone at one reasons for their choices
 these preferences and fair where muldrew asked to taste the exhibits explanations would then be compared with those her assistant
 from the local agricultural society of the judge and the team most closely approxi seemed astonished and said it had
 never been mating the judge s assessment would win smith although the annual fairs gave farm women a chance to
 display their culinary arts they believed they were in constant competition with less desirable elements their goals therefore were to
 promote the educational aspect of fairs and to eliminate such features as the can can show seen here at the
 lethbridge fair in 1912 also recommended that recipes accompany cook the superintendency of fairs which routinely ing exhibits because after
 all a fair should be supplied livestock judges partly as an offshoot educational and for the general welfare of the
 of an official encouragement of mixed farming community never did the same with women s work despite taking another cue
 from the men s exhibits an official encouragement of women s participa smith sought some measure of standardization tion in
 the fairs sometimes the superintendents some way of compa ring fairly two exhibits what would suggest names of women judges
 but the men did was judge kind against kind the old when these people came under fire a superinfashioned sweepsta

 because i served livestock judging it has aljways recollect when attending the fair two years ago seemed very difficult smith
 admitted hearing a certain lady make a great deal of noise judge fairly any class where widely different because she
 did not receive the prizes she recipes are used as a result the final expected the previous year one of
 the very best recourse was not to some clea rly defined criteria horse judges in the province mr w r
 lowes but to the judge s personal preference smith was found fault with by some of your exhibitors concluded if
 those judging could have a although i know positively that there was no meeting and decide on some sta ndard
 forjudging ground for complaint on that occasion next if these recipes selected were given out year i hope your society
 will select its own score cards drawn up perhaps we should in judges in all classes outside the live stock
 4 time have more uniform judging 2 this livestock bias was particularly important unfortunately there was much truth in in
 the overall assessment of the fair which judges smith s claim that the spirit among the men has in alberta
 were required to make and the assessbeen that we must get the very best judge there is ment was the
 most crucial factor in the classifito judge cattle sheep swine and horses but any cation of the fair as the
 province bogged down one around here can judge women s work 3 in the post war depression fair associations were
 pressured to improve and to malgamate foot the judges had also seemingly ignored seeking to reduce the payout of grants
 and to cut another educational feature the introduction of out the weaker fairs the provincial department heliantir tubers a cross
 between a sunflower of agriculture designed a classification system and a artichoke the stems and leaves made very which rated
 fairs according to their community good silage for cattle the tubers boiled made contribution a to e very serious discourage
 tasted sauce for humans and unboiled an equally ment resulted when an agricultural society had a fine repast for hogs
 in fact a person fairly well rating of d or e attractions and travelling needed hogs to keep pace with
 this useful hybrid shows refused to attend and so did exhibitors so fast did it spread dejected over the failure
 of who reckoned quite rightly that the prizes were the fair report to reflect these things walters a pittance partly
 as a result a number of fairs in concluded our judges seem to have too much alberta declined from 108
 in 1921 to only 58 in to do 8 l 929 these difficulties were rendered more perplex the best single
 means of improving the and frustrating by the fact that most women found classification was to highlight the livestock themselves

 generally in the province horses cattle sheep and swine it could also pile after 1910 there was an increase in
 female partup points for support of the fair by local exhibi icipation both in the rank and file and the

 of the total mark 6 1921 eight were women 20 despite this trend as for the activities in which women
 spent most agricultural societies usually had far more most of their time vegetable exhibits and men than women after all
 the work involved domestic products the scorecard provided institute meetings on farm topics or conventions little more than ten points
 even this would not on exhibitions in the dead of winter when have been so bad had the judges been
 able to someone had to stay home with the family and apportion the points fairly often however they increasingly after
 1912 women had their own failed miserably when livestock judges a organizations consequently the membership list of nine women out

 height in the air it burst with a noise like the firing of cannon and musketry the report was heard
 distinctly by mr taylor at the h b post three miles distant who on coming out of the house saw
 puffs of smoke such as would be made by gun shots starting from a common centre in the air where
 the aerolite exploded this appearance was also seen by the indians from their houses the explosion took place over the
 shore of the lake and apparently some of the pieces fell into the lake sending up numerous jets of steam

 by a indian named painted stone and is valued by him as good medicine he only asks twenty five dollars
