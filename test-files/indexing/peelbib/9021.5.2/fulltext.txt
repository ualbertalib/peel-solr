 war or rebellion the books are always written about the fighting men and their battles the soldier serving at some
 potentially dangerous post but who never sees action is usually forgotten this was the fate of the rocky mountain rangers
 a courageous crew of cowboys who sat on a potential powder keg throughout the riel rebellion of 1885 but because
 the tide of war never swept this is a typical rocky mountain ranger as photographed in i 885 by john
 d higinbothain noted author of ‘ when the west was young the ranger is unidentified into their area they received
 only a fleeting mention in the rebellion reports and only a few of the honors of war the rocky mountain
 rangers was an alberta unit raised at fort macleod and assigned a three fold task it was to guard the
 200 mile frontier between lethbridge and the cypress hills protect the cattle herds from thieves and rustlers and act as
 a buffer to keep warlike american indians from surging north to join their canadian cousins in all these assignments the
 rangers were successful even though it meant skirmishes with southern indians and weeks of monotonous patrol but far more important
 their presence in the district was a definite deterrent to open hostilities in the south the rangers had many prominent
 names in its ranks including kootenai brown who was chief scout john herron later a member of parliament dr l
 g de veber who became an m l a an m p and later a senator lord boyle who was
 later the earl of shannon and several more the rank and file however were made up of typical western cowboys
 many of whom had participated in the indian wars in the dakotas to appreciate the situation of the rangers the
 whole rebellion picture should be reviewed for several years the half breeds had been agitating for their rights but all
 their appeals fell on deaf ears in ottawa finally louis riel was induced to return to the central saskatchewan country
 from his home in montana at last with a leader they began to protest more vigorously and ominously until riel
 led his people to rebellion in march 1885 the area of conflict was restricted to central saskatchewan although there was
 a danger of it immediately spreading through central alberta in the edmonton red deer area the greatest danger was from
 the blackfeet tribes with 4 000 indians in southern alberta and another 3 000 just across the line in montana
 although traditional enemies of the crees it was feared the blackfeet might form an alliance to make common war against
 the whites as soon as the rebellion erupted im on april 9 th captain stewart arrived mediate steps had to

 is in receipt of a bound copy of ayers patent medicine almanac printed in ten languages and containing specimen leaves
 in eleven other tongues with a request for a notice no doubt the statements regarding all curing properties of the
 messrs ayers medicines are as reliable as the weather forecasts which the almanac contains the jokes when read in bohemian
 or finnish seem quite new though not very funny ordinarily there is no objection to any vendor setting forth the
 merits of his wares in any manner he may please but there are exceptions to the rule the more common
 exception is when the qualities of the wares are misrepresented the patent medicine men go a step further and besides
 misrepresenting the curative powers of their goods they deliberately and mischeviously misrepresent the symptoms of the diseases which their medicines
 are supposed to cure the most healthy person can read in almost any patent medicine almanac or circular that he
 or she has the symptoms of one or more of the diseases referred to in it and that the only
 salvation is to dose heavily with the medicine prescribed there is no doubt that patent medicines owe three fourths of
 their sales to excitement of the imagination caused by their advertising literature it is safe to say that taking one
 medicine with another their literature causes more sickness and misery than their preparations cure that patent medicine men reap rich
 harvests is well known but more of their money is swindled from the credulous and imaginative than is honestly earned
 by removing the causes of illness their success is proof of the benefits of advertising rather than of the benefits
 of their preparations to the human race edmonton bulletin feb 9 1889 chief factor john rowand by h e rawlinson
 m d during my own time in canada the vanity and extravagance of the north westers were proverbial particularly in
 and about montreal which was then the centre of attraction from its being the great rendezvous and headquarters of the
 fur trade there nothing seemed worthy of being talked about unless it wa associated with the words ‘ north west
 that body took the lead in all asse nblies clubs and other circles of society their name influenced the tone
 of public opinion within as well as without the city the tartars never held the grand lama in higher estimation
 that the canadians did the north westers in these days it was no uncommon thing for a dashing north wester
 to parade the streets of the city with his horse shod with silver shoes nor to be seen throwing handfuls
 of small coins among the children of the habitants on his visits through the country alexander ross fur traders of
 the far west alexander ross who came to canada i was received by mr rowand widely in 1805 wrote in
 his known among the plain indians as the ‘ big mountain he was a powerful but not very growing up
 in such an atmosphere tall man of rough determined aspect and it is small wonder that in 1803 a young
 very near lame from an early accident montreal lad of fourteen years the son hunting alone as a young man
 he had been thrown from his horse and had broken of a surgeon at the montreal general his leg by
 same means intelligence reached hospital entered this glamorous fur cam the fort of what had occurred and before pany as
 an apprentice picture him the whites could do anything an indian girl eager and expectant on the long jour had
 mounted and galloped off in the direction indicated she found him nursed him ney from montreal up the ottawa river
 and saved his life and he married her and across the upper lakes to fort wi 1 in compensation for
 his lameness ham perhaps arriving there in time for rowand acquired a wife who shared his the annual boisterous rendezvous
 of the fortunes till her death in 1848 they had montreal agents and the wintering part three sons one of
 whom was to graduate ners then on by the rainy river route in medicine from the university of edinto winnipeg

 account trans roy soc can sect 11 67 96 1938 dr rawlinson is professor of anatomy at the university of
 alberta in edmonton it was here that thompson met him again on may 12 th 1812 2 the rivalry between
 the hudson s bay and north west companies extended over all the fur country but during these early years on
 the saskatchewan rowand probably did not feel it greatly relations here were mostly amicable and on occasion even friendly however
 in 1816 he was moved to the very centre of the battle where the competition was intense and bitter in
 this year he was sent to the fort at bas de la riviere an important depot on the company s
 route from the east it was situated in the present province of manitoba a couple of miles up the winnipeg
 river from its entrance into the lake it was also some 70 miles from the selkirk colony that had been
 established only four years earlier and which had become the focal point in the struggle it is likely that rowand
 had some direct contact with the principals in the tragic events of that june day in 1816 when a situation
 that the north westers had deliberately contrived culminated in the battle of seven oaks it resulted in the death of
 the governor of the new colony and a score of his men the temporary abandonment of the settlement at red
 river and the gleeful self con gratulations of the north westers as they gathered at fort william the aftermath john
 rowand was a pioneer of the western fur trade and was chief faclor at fort edmonton from 1823 until his
 death in 1854 his big house or rowand s folly was an ‘ imposing landmark at edmonton and was mentioned
 by most early travellers while the indian tribes observed it with awe by cohn robertson who unable to arrive promptly
 to take charge at fort edmonton in 1822 wrote in a letter of instructions in all airangements of this nature
 it would be a ‘ ery desirable object if due attention was paid to the opinion of mr rowand indeed
 i cannot help thinking that much advantage might be derived from the advice of that gentleman owing to his perfect
 knowledge of the business of the saskatchewan district cf that battle certainly affected rowand directly for his fort was just
 within the selkirk grant and it was seized when the red river colony was re established in january 1817 in
 the next three turbulent years it was the site of much manoeuvering between the contenders but the days of battle
 were numbered divided the fur traders courted disaster the canadians lacked the financial strength and stability of the hudson s
 bay company while the latter in turn desperately needed the vitality and enterprise of the wintering partners in the north
 west concern cooler heads and wiser counsels were gaining in influence and in 1821 the union of the two companies
 brought the strife to a close a year before this occurred rowand was once more back in the edmonton district
 now a mature man of 32 with sufficient of a reputation to be admitted to ‘ the new ‘ concern
 as a chief trader he was ‘ first posted to rocky mountain house and his ability was attested to the
 union brought to the fore the most talented and able man in all history of the canadian fur trade sir
 george simpson his ability and devotion to the company s interests soon lifted him to the post of governor in
 chief of rupert s land making him the most powerful figure in the canadian sphere of the company s activities
 till his death in 1860 simpson s efforts immediately after the union were directed towards the sorely needed rehabil itaticn

 i may be permitted to record my personal tribute of regard for the memory of an old and staunch friend
 from whom both in public and a private capacity i ever received a firm and consistent support frequently at times
 when councils were divided and such support was valuable he was a man of sterling integrity and a warm heart
 and was not surpassed by any officer in the service for unswerving devotion to the public interest 1 but still
 rowand s story was not closed and a bizarre chapter was to be written before the chief factor s bones
 reached their final resting place first he was uried at fort pitt but sir george having heard from john jr
 of his father s wish to b e buried in mdntreal had the body disinterred and according to tradition rendered
 down to the bones a letter from simpson to the doctor son alexander carries on the story i directed that
 the package with the bones should be brought out this summer 1856 to norway house from whence i conveyed it
 this summer in my own canoe to red river but some of the crew having discovered the contents of the
 package i was afraid they might from a superstitious feeling drop it overboard at some time and therefore had it
 repacked and sent to york factory for transmission to england by ship from whence it will be forwarded to this
 place lachine the wish of the family at red river is to erect a handsome monument to their lather s
 memory and i have undertaken to see the design carried out the cost of the monument i placed over the
 grave of my poor wife was 500 and i think for that sum i could now get a very handsome
 tomb erected for the reception of your father s bones 1 this letter was written in july 1856 but according
 to the records of the mount royal cemetery company it was not until november 10 1858 over four years after
 his death that rowand s bones reached their third and final resting place in one of canada s most beautiful

 this imposing red granite monument marks the last resting place of chief factor john rowand it was erected by his
 family at the family plot in mount royal cemetery montreal creature whenever he leaves edmonton finally apparently making the best
 of it he says i suppose old rowand will hang on for d while yet 4 and so he did
 but when those letters were written he had little more than a couple of years left in may 1854 as
 he had regularly done for the past fifty years he supervised the loading of the fur returns and then led
 the brigade on the so familiar journey to the council at norway house as the boats swung out into the
 stream below the fort a farewell glance at the stockaded post on the hill may have drawn his thoughts backward
 to the time a half century earlier when as a youngster he had first climbed ashore at that spot and
 there would be a host of memories to signalize the remarkable changes he had experienced but the bend of the
 river soon shut the scene from his eyes for the last time the boats slipped on down stream and reached
 fort pitt where his eldest son john j r now a mature man of 42 was in charge it was
 a post that the q ld chief factor had himself established 25 years before his own 65 years must have
 felt heavy because he told his son john that when he died he would like to be buried in his
 birthplace montreal it was a premonition the very next day when a violent quarrel broke out among the boatmen john
 rowand rushed out to children would be there certainly dr since that day a new and greater alexander rowand from

 mind would west of edmonton mount rowand lifts be flooded with a host of memories of a shining peak to

 his greatest monument prospecting in the british possessions we received a call yesterday from mr john wales formerly of this
 city who has just arrived from an extended trip through the saskatchewan country mr wales left chicago on april 8
 th last and after paying a short visit to the red river settlement he followed the saskatchewan to the mountains
 the reports of the scarcity of provisions at fort garry and vicinity he confirms the grasshoppers made a clean sweep
 of everything in the shape of crops the buffalo hunters found no game north of the missouri river and consequently
 the unfortunate people are reduced to extreme want and must perish from hunger unless aid is sent them from the
 states at fort pitt and fort victoria the settlers had been more fortunate and had saved enough grain to support
 them during the winter at fort edmonton terrible hail storms had destroyed everything there a number of miners were at
 work on the river bars from four to six dollars a day were made with copper plates and quick silver
 after a few days rest here mr wales and party struckout for the mountains through the blackfoot country but saw
 no indians during five weeks spent in prospecting they did not even find a color though black sand was abundant
 tired of this fruitless toil they went to the mountain fort rocky mountain house on sept 1 st there was
 then about a foot of snow on the ground and the mud in a newly painted cabin remained frozen for
 over a week after resting for a short time the party turned their faces towards mon tana found six inches
 of snow and about an inch of ice at the head of milk river the party also prospected the porcupine
 mountains with no success the journey from the mountain fort to sun river 500 miles they accomplished in four weeks
 helena weekly herald oct 22 1868 from the old land to the new a pioneer s impressions and recollections part
 2 by richard gavin reid our brief stop over in edmonton in the spring of 1904 while it was interesting
 and instructive was merely a temporary halt in our progression toward our objective settlement on the land to be taken
 up again on the return of our land seekers from their voyage of discovery what this party set out to
 find was suitable land for homesteading for fourteen men whose homesteads had to be close together to make a basis
 for a close knit settlement the homesteads had to be located in adjacent blocks of 4 3 and 2 or
 as near that as possible to accommodate family groups of these numbers to fit these bits and pieces into a
 comnosite pattern embodying all these conditions was not only difficult it was found to be impossible some compromises had to
 be made and it was on this basis that the final allocations were recommended and accepted the area selected lay
 in the northern part of township 48 in ranges 8 and 9 about 45 miles south and east of vegrevihle
 and the distances between the most cutlying projected farms scarcely exceeded a maximum of two miles one might wonder why
 we had to go 145 miles from edmonton to find locations it is true that there were many homesteads open
 for filing particularly to the east of vegreville but not nearly as many as might be indicated by the qenerally
 scattered settlement the plain fact was that large numbers of quartersections had been filed on in anticipation of the construction
 of the canadian northern railway which was definitely qoing to be built quite soon right through the territory explored by
 our land seekers in any event strange as it may seem we were just as close to edmonton as we
 could get to be unless we would be content to abandon our idea of close settlement and settle for location
 on scattered homesteads this of course we were not prepared to do this is the last in a series of
 two articles by mr reid dealing with pioneer life in alberta mr reid settled in the vermilion district in 1904
 and became an m l a in 1921 for the u f a party he served as premier of alberta
 in 1934 and 1935 he is now librarian for canadian utilities ltd in edmonton richard gavin reid author of this
 article is shown here in a portrait taken during his term as premier of alberta 1934 35 speaking of projected
 railways in the fall of the same year i was in edmonton again i was passing a real estate office
 on 1 st street and i noticed a map advertising lands they had for sale in our immediate neighborhood on
 the map three projected railroads were shown all passing within a mile or two of my homestead from the north
 the canadian northern was shown taking a sharp dip southward for about eleven miles from the south the grand trunk
 pacific most obligingly swung from its appointed path a matter of about eighteen miles and between the two a third
 one passed through without deviation of the three this last one did have some justification for its use as a
 possible sales stimulant for a charter did actually exist for its construction where it was actually intended to join some
 other rail line in alberta to the west of us i have stage was to fort saskatchewan at which forgotten
 but its eastward destination point the north saskatchewan was crosswas cutknife saskatchewan at which ed by ferry from the fort
 it continued point it was to join up with a stub line generally in an eastward direction but from north
 battleford that then existed still a little to the north this northward and is still in operation had the pattern
 trend was necessary as the beaver lake of railway development not changed had to be passed at its northern tip
 at with more reliance evolving on highway this point the beaver creek had to be transportation it might have been
 built crossed again this had to be done by but it never was and never will be ferry leaving the
 lake a southerly in all of this the intent to mislead did trend in the easterly direction developed exhibit a
 sad lack of ethics business or leading to vegreville from there to our otherwise looking at it philosophically destination about
 forty five miles its however i am sure little harm was done direction continued a little to the south unless
 it was to the real estaters them of east but for the last twelve miles after selves for everyone who
 might have we had to leave the trail it was directly been attracted by the map i am sure south
 there must have been many many more in anticipation this did not appear to who were repelled by this obvious
 dis be a too formidable trip and had conditortion of the facts of the situation tions been anything near normal
 it would now however we had reached the have presented no great difficulties in place where active preparations for the
 a vague general way we knew that the trip to the homesteads had to be faced road conditions were not
 supposed to be first port of call was the dominion land of the best but how far short we fell
 of office then in the charge of mr norquay estimating just how bad they actually who was the son of
 the early premier of were remained for us to learn the hard manitoba under his guidance the oper way ations
 of his office were conducted in an atmosphere marked by its freedom from spring is never a good time for
 roads the formal coldly efficient official atti but it happened that this particular year came at about the end of
 a wet cycle tudes usually associated with such agen as a result of this accumulation of procies it was quite
 evident from the courtesy and friendliness that characterized cipitation from year to year water levels the staff in its relations
 with its public were higher than i have ever seen them since there was a superabundance of that it was
 the direct reflection cf the lakes and sloughs and the soil and subspirit of the whole community but what soil
 were literally saturated as if this ever the reason it certainly made the was not enough a few days before
 we land office a pleasant place to do busi started our travels we had one of these ness in early
 may snowstcrms that we occasion five of us intended to pull out for the ally have in which some six
 or eight homesteads just as soon as possible inches of sleety snow fell three teams of horses and wagons had
 to be bought together with such basic it has occurred to me at times that in necessities as would be
 needed fcr im these more enlightened latter days mediate operations and these of course road bans would have made such
 an had to be limited by the size of the loads expedition impossible further thouqht our teams could handle however
 shows such a conclusion to be in error road bans are not impcsed in all of these preparations we made
 ‘ wimarily in the interests of the travelling few mistakes but the main credit for this public their main purpose
 being the promust go to the people we bought from tection of the investments of the govern with few exceptions
 they not only treat ment and the municipalities in their ed us fairly but they also helped us with highways
 on such a basis road bans much good advice we needed that ad neither could nor would have been imvice
 and had sense enough to accept posed as there was no highway investmost of it ment to protect from a
 point less than in a few days we were ready for the ten miles east of fort saskatchewan i road
 the route we were to follow was doubt if there was an aggregate of one known as the edmonton battleford
 trail mile of road on which improvement of on leavincr edmonton this trail s first any kind had been made
 as i have mentioned we had to travel places unfortunately for us we were a total of 145 miles and
 this took us ex never able to forecast how far we would actly 14 days an average of just a
 little be able to travel on any given day so short of 101 2 miles our best day was all
 we could do at each day s end was from edmonton to fort saskatchewan a to try to get overnight
 accommodation distance at that time of about 18 miles wherever we might be at the time i cur worst on
 a stretch west of beaver must say that we never were turned lake where from about seven in the down
 sometimes we were in luck the morning till 8 30 at night we covered accommodation was good judged by the
 somewhere between 3 ½ and 4 2 miles standards then obtained along the trail this was a long too long
 a day for at other times conditions were more horses how they stood up to it as they primitive did
 was a mystery to me till i realized typical of the latter was one place that it was the men
 and not the horses where we stopped at dusk just after we that were doing most of the work when
 had crossed over beaver creek on the we came to a mudhole an automatic ferry the main building was a
 single routine was followed all three teams combination home barn structure that were hooked up to one wagon and when
 housed all the farm stock cattle hogs it had been pulled through to the other and chickens in one end
 with a large side we unhooked and brought the re room in the other for the family father inaining two
 through in succession from mother and a number of young children the how daily mileage we made it is easy
 including a baby there was only one to see that even though the days were door into the building and
 it opened into long the horses were resting for the the alleyway behind the cattle stalls greater part of the
 time entering this door you turned to the stopping houses were plentiful along left and at the end of this
 passage you the way where food and shelter for man came to an inner door usually left open and beast
 could be had at reasonable that led into the home at one end of rates for sleeping accommodation no the
 room there was one of those large attempt was made to provide beds or home built continental stoves that folbedding
 to meet this need each tra lowing the usual pattern had a quite yeller had his own blankets and it
 was small fireplace but an extensive platform one of the prerogatives of the accommo surrounding it on which the family
 slept dation he was paying for that he could at the other end of the room there was spread his
 primitive bed on the kitchen a large table set into a corner with floor i suppose these floors were hard
 wooden benches extending along the and no doubt some of those who shared walls on one side and one end
 of the the floor with us overnight tossed and table the building itself was of logs turned cr even snored
 but overtired as plastered inside and out with the usual we were from the preceding day on the mixture of
 clay and straw and the same train they left no impression on our material furnished the floor overall sleep drugged

 sole source of livelihood for those even in the face of all these conditions who ran them if such had
 been the case on the accepted basis of any port in a they would have starved to death it storm
 we were once more lucky in was merely a case of the need being finding shelter for the night on
 the present and the impossibility of turning matter of food however we were not tired travellers away probably hate at
 quite so lucky these hospitable people night and sometimes in bad weather to simply could not feed us and the
 provipeople of normal sympathies there was sions we carried with us for our noonno escape these sojourners had to be

 but the hiving room was other hazard of the trail and don t think out of bounds to them as
 they found for a moment we were not duly thankful from time to time when they strayed in i must
 admit i was quite curious and which they frequently did here under very interested in how these people over one

 and order efficiently when one of our lads died in his sheep over his extensive territory but was heart disease
 was the cause and it came highly regarded and respected by all as the aftermath to an attack of rheuma
 even by those who on occasion he had tic fever which he had contracted several to deal with in his
 official capacity years previously we took the body to to aid him in his duties he had a vegreville for
 burial and when i say we lock up that measured about six feet in i mean all of our group
 of settlers with width by ten feet in length inside there one exception as someone had to stay were two
 bunks one over the other and behind to look after the livestock over all there was a roof of poles
 covered immediately following our arrival in with sods when not in use for penal vegreville there was nothing left un
 purposes the accommodation was used done by these people that could have as a bunkhouse by the travelling public been
 done to assist us in our sad task it happened one night that pete had i hook back on the
 funeral over the years been relaxing in the hotel bar room as one of the most reverent sympathetic there were
 quite a number there that ceremonies of its kind i have ever attend evening enjoying the normal pleasures ed despite
 a simplicity that verged on of the establishment one of the guests the primitive i know that this feeling took
 on just too much of a load and was shared by the others in attendance despite the efforts of his
 friends to keep including those from the town who turn him under control he created a bit of a ed
 out practically en masse disturbance to such an extent in fact there was as i mentioned a hotel that pete
 had no option but to arrest owned and operated by mr st hilare him and put him in the lock
 up for the it being pretty well established by this night time that when the iailway came through soon after
 this happened pete was the town would have to move the policy called out into the country on another of
 the business people was to scratch mission his prisoner in the meantime along as best they could pending that began
 to miss the good fellowship of the move the bedrooms upstairs were very bar and the longer his thoughts ran
 in small only about two or three feet wider this vein the more his thirst increased than the beds the
 only partitions be finally he climbed into the upper bunk tween them consisted of building paper and proceeded to break
 jail by pushing suspended from the ceiling no frame the roof poles aside and removing the work of any kind
 supporting them and sods enough to let him scramble through no doors one of our party staying in back to
 the barroom he went rejoining the hotel one night was undressing be his friends and continued his carouse fore going
 to bed he had reached the it may be that he passed from the stage when he was taking off
 his socks stage of aggressive drunkenness to the why he did not sit down on the bed to more sentimental
 stage that sometimes do this i don t know but the plain fact follows in any event his friends had
 is that he was trying to remove them been trying to persuade him that his jail standing up it might
 have been that break was really a low down trick to a realization of the danger of his posi play
 on pete and believe it or not he tion suddenly struck him but whatever finally agreed he crawled back through
 the cause was he lost his balance burst the roof filled in the hole as best he through the flimsy
 wall and crashed onto could and peacefully slept through the the bed next door fortunately that bed balance of the
 night awaiting the due was not occupied at the time otherwise process of law that caught up with him there
 might have been either a fight or in the justice of the peace court next a scandal depending on the
 sex of the morning occupant this amusing incident clearly illus the police detachment covered a huge trates that respect for
 law and order territory how far it extended to the was generally an outstanding characsouth and west i don t
 know but there teristic of our early settlers it may well is little doubt it went quite far north and
 be that many of them brought this out look with them from their countries of lurking in the background of
 our conorigin but there certainly must have sciousness was dissipated to our satisbeen some few whose respect came from faction
 at least the law ministration in this the having reached the homestead it is mounted police was by far the
 most time to call a halt much more could effective part of the set up be said that might be
 of passing interest before leaving vegreville we found but let me limit myself to one or two there was an
 alternate route to our brief enerah observations that may give destination that was said to be much something of the
 atmosphere in which better than the one we had followed so these pheasant creative years were spent far and this
 we proposed to follow for to a bunch of young adventurous the first fourteen miles we travelled to people and
 we were mostly young and the south before we joined the wetciski practically all adventurous what could win north battleford
 trail which as a be more challenging than the situation matter of fact finally took us to a point we
 found ourselves in each with his about half a mile south of my homestead 160 acres of virgin land calling
 to him the road conditions though far from for improvement and beyond that the ideal were quite as good as
 we had wider demand for the conveniences been told they would be and by com necessary for the establishment of
 settled parison with what went before a very communities such as churches schools great improvement it is true it passed
 and roads to realize that all along this through some very rough hilly terrain 145 miles of road where practically
 that we were later to know as the bad nothing of this nature existed when we lands but mud holes
 while still present first passed through and that it was were much less plentiful all in all this only a
 few short years till the whole last forty five mile stage by comparison area was covered by school districts and
 and everything goes by comparison improvement districts providing the was almost pheasant necessary educational facilities and looking back on the
 whole trip we making some tangible steps towards the were more than pleased that it was over establishment of a
 system of roads the and rather inclined to be a little proud railroad came and with it trading cenof our
 accomplishment but for a shade tres about every eight miles each with of doubt that our troubles and tribula its
 grain elevators stores and other tions might have been considerably places of business this transformation lessened had we been able
 to bring more must stand as a lasting tribute not only experience to our endeavours even this to the productiveness
 of the land but doubt however was resolved through even more to these hardy settlers who time brought it all
 about for all these im between beaver lake and vegreville provements came in the last analysis we passed three teams
 on their way to from the product of the soil edmonton to bring back loads of mer these settlers themselves
 for the most chandise for some of the stores in town part were young and rugged individuals the three men
 were established settlers but their outstanding qualities were of several years duration in the vegre steadfastness reliability and integrity vihle
 district skilled and experienced in what could withstand such a combinathe ways of the trail we stopped and tion talked
 to them for a spell and there is little doubt we gave them rather a full written contracts were rarely
 resorted account of the slow and difficult progress to why should they be when experience we had made to that
 point however had shown again and again that a we passed on our various ways but we man s word
 was as good as his bond did not forget them naturally we were lending and borrowing were common anxious to
 know what sort of a trip they practice in an atmosphere of mutual had and how long it took trust
 and co operation but for years about two months hater this informa thieving was never heard of i will tion
 did reach us over the grapevine never forget the first stealing incident route for the trip from edmonton to some
 person or persons unknown stole vegreville they took fourteen days while a set of eveners and whiffle trees that we
 made it in eleven and so the shadow had been left where they had been last of the inferiority complex
 that had been used on the open prairie they were probably worth not more than 3 but was the feeling
 that the whole character no one who did not live through these of the area had been damaged years in
 this or some similar settlement as i have said these were pleasant could believe the extent of the wave of
 years they were constructive years and indignation and resentment that swept it was a real privilege that comes to few
 over the district like wild fire the actual to have been associated with the men loss itself was nothing what
 did hurt and this territory in those early years a pioneer school teacher i n 1862 a young irishman named
 constantine scohlen arrived at fort edmonton and opened a school for the children of white and half breed employees at

 mr christie is william christie chief factor of the fort and the company is the hudson s bay company dec
 24 1862 as i suppose your lordship is aware that the company refused to give any assistance i need not
 say anything on that head although the people in the fort are only poor yet they were very glad to
 have an opportunity of supporting a school for their children i take my meals in mr j cunningham s house
 and in return he sends his four boys to the school free of charge i began to teach about the
 end of september and although the boys did not know even the alphabet there are many of them now reading
 mr christie has acknowledged that they have learned more during the two months that i have been here than in
 the space of two years under mr wolsehy the ministex of this place i suppose father lacombe will ask the
 books that are necessary for the next year and if your lordship should wish french to be taught as well
 as english i feel that i shall be able to do so when required april 30 1863 there are two
 children at the mission whose father was murdered by the black feet a few weeks ago they are indians of
 the stoney tribe my boys are learning english pretty fast now the most of them can read and write although
 they did not know the alphabet in the beginning mr christie and the people of the fort are all very
 glad to have a school for their children i should be very glad to receive a few school cards for
 beginners if there are any to spare at the red river college if there is also a terrestial globe to
 spare it will be very useful to me here to give explanations to the boys jan 7 1864 we had
 an examination in the school a few weeks ago it was attended by rev f lacombe mr christie and some
 other gentlemen of the fort all of whom seemed well pleased with the progress of the pupils after the examination
 mr christie gave the boys a very encouraging lecture which i am sure they will all profit by dec 29
 1864 the more i teach these poor little children the greater love i feel for them and the greater is
 my desire to see them advance rapidly in their studies my pupils are 30 in number scollen remained as a
 teacher until 1871 when he became a missionary to the bhackfeet indians and constructed our lady of peace mission at

 neill the poetess found much to write about in the foothills of alberta but more than anything else it was
 the beauty of the hand the skies the ‘ flowers and the changing seasons that captivated her imagination instead of
 fearing the long cold winters as did many people from the old country she saw beauty in frigid months ‘
 always there is the lovely aspect of the hills under snow white against the radiant blue she wrote softened as
 a face is softened by a smile every dimple and delicate depression of the ground marked by a transparent shadow
 on the snow its sunlit whiteness set off by the dark of leafless willows that trace the windings of the
 frozen creek and in the spring she loved to ride out frcm her ranch hcuse to find forgetme nots one

 we always go to find the first forget me note in called ‘ the ridge she wrote as though there
 were no other elevation of its kind in all this mountain cquntry it is a stony ridge its top half
 covered with dwarf poplars and a little creeping plant with tasteless red ‘ berries the lea ves of which indians
 smoke for tobacco and call kinnikinni ck as you ride up and top this ridge there bursts upon you quite
 suddenly the widest and most glorious view that can possibly be imagined the eround at your feet falls ‘ oway
 to a great distance on your left by a steep slope covered with dark willows there is a long wide
 valley with stretches of willow and a gleam of water then theground rises and fall s for miles in a
 succession of hfg h curving ridges for all the world as if the earth had broken into billows like gravel
 from sill to sill a log building that ‘ was used beicre the house was built still ‘ stands and
 gives every indication of lasting many a year yet moira o neill was fond of her house and ‘ commented
 that a western home if well built ‘ very warm and tight in winter time of course with the addition
 of double windows and if warm in winter it will be cool in summer besides one can have a verandah
 on the eastern side where the little flower garden will be and as soon as the sun is overhead the
 verandah makes the pheasantest sitting place with the scent of mignonette cind the cucumber vine about it if the house
 is well finished inside she ‘ continued it can be made very pretty in a simple way a friehd once
 described our house as ‘ o ihed with cedar ind painted with vermilion having lived the sea some of these
 land billows have exactiy the curve and poise of a sea wave before it breaks on the shore but the

 first boom there is a boom in land all over the north west every railroad station every crossing of a
 river every junction of two creeks almost every four corners is being laid out in town sites and the lots
 are being purchased by parties who never saw them at all prices from 20 upwards lots are being sold in
 towns where there is not a house in sight and farms are purchased which have not even been located much
 less improved people seem to have forgotten that towns cannot hive of themselves that they must have people to give
 them life and make them valuable and that farms are of no actual value unless they produce something as we
 have remarked before this boom has struck edmonton with full force and fib co town hots that last fall sold
 at 25 apiece that being a fair value now change hands at 300 although only five additional buildings at a
 cost perhaps of 3 000 have been put up on the whole 3 000 acres since with five or six
 more in course of erection the lots that were sold last fall were purchased by people here mostly for actual
 use but since then they have fallen almost altogether into the hands of wealthy eastern speculators who are forcing up
 the prices not by putting on improvements but by simply holding on with a strong grip intending to make a
 big thing in the future when the place grows no matter whether it is the h b co or the
 general public the settlers or the speculators the owners or the jumpers all hands are holding on to what land
 they have for high figures or until the place grows some will not sell because they think they have sold
 enough more because they cannot get enough profit on their investment some because they are not positive where their dividing
 lines are some because they fear that if they sell their title to the hand may be injured and some
 because they have no title at all but all will sell when the place grows did any of these people
 ever think how the town can grow if it is not allowed hand to grow on if men who wish
 to start business are obliged to sink a large portion of their capital out of proportion to the amount of
 business to be done in the necessary land they may try to find some other place in which business will
 be equally good and the price of land not so high this country is not by any means opened up
 yet and it may be that in a year or two the centre of population may be miles away from
 here if edmonton has not by that time concentrated the business of the district in itself it is to be
 feared that the place will never grow there are many other points on the river that afford just as good
 a town site steamboat handing and railway crossing and are just as accessible by the trails as edmonton and should
 the railroad company choose any of these as the crossing or terminus cf their branch line the prices of hots
 there would go up as high or higher than they are in edmonton now while here the hand would be
 worth no more than any similar stretch along the river bank we do not wish to say anything against the
 prcspects of edmonton it is now the best town in manitoba or the territories west of portage ha prairie and
 has better prospects than any other outside of winnipeg it has every advantage that can be had in this district
 and a good start besides but it has not got such a start as to make it safe for the
 people to sit down and say that they will do nothing except hold on to the hand those who own
 lots should build on them those who have large properties should assist in public works those who have claims should
 set aside all petty differences settle their boundaries amongst themselves if the government will not do it and agree about
 the haying out of a portion of their land in lots in a uniform manner hay out a few more
 streets and improve what there are so that when the rush commences this summer the place will have an attractive
 and business like appearance and so that every one who comes to stay will have the opportunity of acquiring a
 permanent interest however small in it in this way and in this way only our hands will be strengthened for
 the tug of war that is sure to take place when the railroad crossing is to be located when this
 is finally settled on in our favor the future of the place is assured but until then those who own
 land should exert themselves to the extent of their ability and not merely sit down and wait until the place
