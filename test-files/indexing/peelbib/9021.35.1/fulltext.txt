 divi dr amatically from year to year while the hope siveness within the community of having a major woolen mill
 industry estab throughout the decade the newspaper editors lamented the lack of unity among their fellow dr wilson is an
 instwctor in the department of townspeople noting as late as 1899 that the humanities social sciences at medicine hat college
 lished was no closer to fruition even making commercial use of the abundant natural gas was a problem j c
 colter an innovative inventorbusinessman advanced ideas to exploit the gas few of his fellow citizens seemed interested obviously what the
 town needed were strong leaders who could unite people behind commu nity goals the potential for growth existed however t
 t he vision and the visionaries failed to create the necessary climate of optimism as it was medicine hat languished
 while sister prairie communities flourished the men and women of early medicine hat were not unique primarily of ontario or
 mari time stock they arrived in the west eager to make their mark and perhaps even earn a fortune they
 were mostly anglo saxon protestants who embodied the work ethic and could have fitted equally well into any of the
 town in the north west then what was different about medicine hat that brought on a leadership crisis in retrospect
 it appears the problem that polarized around two men j k jake drinnan editor of the local newspaper and john
 niblock assistantsuperintendent of the canadian pacific railway both were in crucial positions within the a central figure in the medicine
 hal dispute was john niblock of the canadian pacific railway economic structure of the young communtty jake drinnan a humorous

 as a capable and proven administrator but school district was formed in september of 1886 to many of his employees
 and to considerable he held the respect of the community for his fine numbers of townspeople he was a tyrant
 and a leadership in the school 6 in march of 1889 bigot drinnan left teaching and assumed the position john

 years old when he assumed the community command of a division which stretched from when niblock took charge of the

 as being humanitarian and benefactor acted too much the dictator benevolent as he tried to be and it was that
 feature of his personality and style which repelled many of the citizens of medicine hat charges were levelled against niblock
 which made many of his actions appear petty chastizing employees who indulged in gambling on their own times prohibiting employees
 from doing business with merchants who were either unfnendly to him or had undesirable characteristics such as imbibing alcohol indulging
 in business prac tices which discriminated against some railway customers who were not his supporters and following discrimatoty hiring practices
 against catholics whatever it was that caused niblock to become so embroiled in the controver sies within the community his
 presence served to intensify the conflict and led to an almost irreparj able impasse by the mid 1890 s niblock

 the medk ine hat tii s free from fractious quarreling and the railway strongly opposed niblock s authority in the

 john yet whyte did not accede to the wishes of the a macdonald s liberal conservative party citizen s committee
 when asked for niblock s first elected in 1887 regina s colorful davin transfer out of medicine hat obviously he
 be was on a grand tour of his large constituency car e aware of just how complicated the crisis following
 his nomination at the moose jaw conwas and must have realized that the removal of vention earlier that month the
 church of one man would not immediately solve the england s reading room in medicine hat was problem packed for
 the meeting but davin was not in good another key player in the events which unfolded form in fact to
 all appearances he was heavily in medicine hat during the 1890 s was thomas intoxicated l tweed born in kingston
 ontario tweed led by thomas tweed and william cousins arrived in medicine hat early in may 1883 even enraged local
 conservatives not only censured before the rails were laid into the valley he and davin publically but decided shortly thereafter
 his partner james lougheed knew that the loca to put forth the name of thomas tweed to contion chosen for
 the river crossing would be a serv test the seat as an independent even though ice point for the huge
 construction crews and tweed earlier had promised his support to they were prepared to provide for their needs davin j

 tweed was joined by another young easterner through the pages of the medicine hat times the john l ewart in

 and rail not satisfied with exposing tweed editor way medical officer within a year he would drinnan turned his attention
 to niblock and the 4 was of course anathema to the teetotaling railway official before the shock of this attack
 by drinnan had subsided another thunderbolt came through the newspaper in the form of a letter to the editor on
 april 9 1891 the writer an indignant parent of a grown daughter charged a prominent railroad official james homer with
 attempted rape this letter could not have come at a more propitious time for the editor and drinnan pulled out
 all the stops still another week has passed and no reported investigation of those fierce rumors of an attempted rape
 on a poor defenseless for eign girl by a railroad official a prominent member of a respectable church and one
 who carries his head well up in society he has not even been suspended pending an enquiry 3 for drinnan
 niblock s hesitancy to move against one of his own officials was interpreted as being indicative of the cavalier attitude
 displayed consistently by the railway hierarchy of the community others in their letters to the editor rose to niblock s
 defence urging citizens not to overact for fear of harming a man s reputation drinnan may have been unaware that
 the railway officers were at work investigating the thomas tweed local businessman and member of the charge as william whyte
 general superinten territorial legislature supported niblock in the contro dent of the western division in winnipeg would versy which split
 the community later indicate affair s of the hospital at the annual meeting held when the matter came to my
 notice i made a thorough to discuss hospital matters the editor questioned investigation and was satisfied that while homer may
 niblock s financia l management this attack for have been a little indiscreet in his conduct yet he had no
 intention of raping the girl 4 many readers must have been shocking indeed by june of 1891 phillipine baron the
 supas niblock considered this hospital his very own posed victim and her family had withdrawn the special pride and joy
 dnnnan s public attack accusation against roadmaster homer homer would be very painful for him in turn entered a successful
 libel suit against the it is about time mr niblock was told in unmeasured terms he does not own the
 bodies and souls of the medicine hat times forcing editor dnnnan to free and independent citizens of medicine hat and
 make a public apology drinnan s intemperate he cannot with impunity smurch their characters i handling of this touchy issue
 was enough to concannot overlook his tyranical disposition nor submit to its dictates 2 vince a number of businessman friends
 of nib john niblock president of the hospital board lock and tweed to withdraw their advertising along with thomas tweed
 and other members from the newspaper of the board naturally denied any financial mis everyone was paying so much attention
 to the management and favouritism in regards to hospi homer case that they overlooked some r ather tal purchasing procedures
 positive developments this included a special committee being set up to advance the cause of and yet william cousins and
 lewis cochran munictpal incorporation and just as interest merchants of the town and opponents of niblock peaked in the libel
 case the first of many major made explicit charges that the railway supenn gas discovenes was made in july 1891

 unfriendly to the the first weak flow of gas was found by the diamond interests of the railway cochran a

 struck the writer put it aptly gravel water and mud being thrown twenty feet in this district possesses everything necessary

 on cpr river water building stone brick and pottery clay and property momentarily all citizens rejoiced at the natur al

 good fortune even tweed and drinnan of the boundary it would be fifteen years ahead of spoke on the same
 platform in glowing terms what it is about the town future incorpor ation that it would be different in 1894
 in the january perennial issue was again r aised throughout the 25 th issue of the times the editor made
 mention cout se of the year but citizens decided not to of a movement afoot to start a rival newspaper
 chance a more independent course for the village in the town it would be he charged the per editor drinnan
 believed that a great mistake sonal organ of messrs niblock and tweed and has been made since a manufacturer who
 wishes their clique drinnan was adamant in his effort to locate here must have a corporate body to deal to
 keep his own newspaper operating with we can tell this clique that their efforts to muzzle in the editor was
 referring to recent negotiations dependent criticism will be as fruitless now as they have been in the past the limes
 is here to stay 9 between an eastern woollen manufacturer and drinnan must have known then what others in several
 community entrepreneurs the medicine hat region had become widely known as a good town suspected that the niblock faction was
 literally drying up the times only three large area for raising sheep the succulent short grass advertisements now appeared weekly
 the largest being in plentiful supply for these foragers a being from drinnan s stalwart friend and supwoollen mill for
 the town made a lot of sense and stimulated considerable interest yet an in porter merchant lewis b cochran that
 with smaller advertisements was not enough to run fluential minority opposed the scheme ito incor a profitable business the inevitable
 came in por ate and it was allowed to drop 7 obvious february 1894 when j k drinnan announced ly
 drinnan endorsed the manufacturer s proposal that he was selling his newspaper to a newly and the necessity of incorporation
 organized publishing company the medicine hat drinnan did not identify those who were reluc news company the shareholders of the
 comtant to move the community ahead reading be pany were all supporters of john niblock in his tween the lines
 one can speculate that the rail valedictory statement drinnan for the final way interest was the only group with sufficient
 time could lash out at the one man whom he saw weight to block development locally john nib as the
 blight of the community lock seemed to have considerable influence as on every occasion niblock s interference has been to
 how development should proceed in that lay the signal for a renewal of the strife and matters in the seeds
 of further division as the year drew to dispute which would have been settled amicably had he remained neutral since
 coming to medicine hat a close he has been the cause of more strife among citizens after a hectic 1891
 the citizens must have an more bitterness between former friends than the worst ticipated a more peaceful new year the
 years political demagogue could be 2 1892 and 1893 were fortunately not as laden the attack a gainst drinnan by
 the niblock facwith crisis some citizens rejoiced when superin tion was followed by the group s move to distendent niblock
 remarried his new wife being miss the hospital s medical officer drinnan s a sister in law to a prominent
 lethbridge lawyer close friend and supporter dr j g calder this others were surely pleased with the new liquor prompted
 william cousins to join battle against licensing system introduced into the territories the niblock forces 2 i perhaps it was
 that dccia relief from the heavy handed prohibition of sion by cousins which had the greatest impact early years on
 the town in every way cousins was a man with the exception of a few minor problems just like his
 good friend thomas tweed both there appeared to be little public controversy were entrepreneurs fellow presbyterians enduring these years also
 little attempt was made thusiastic boosters for medicine hat and each to gain corporate status for the town one letter
 was the equal of the other they had worked 6 ‘ t z s ‘ medicine hat as seen here
 in the l 890 s was caught up in a struggle which caused its leaders to devote more time to
 squabbling than to the future of the community together well over the years for many communi ham van home cpr
 president the petition ty causes politically their values were identi begged him to transfer assistant superintendent cal yet finally these
 two powerful leaders niblock to some other division broke with each other it was almost as if the on july
 20 th in an emergency meeting of the townspeople drew into two camps niblock hospital board dr calder wa dismissed
 from tweed against drinnan cousins it was the lat his position as medical superintendent friction ter force which made the
 next move between the doctor and the president of the hospi early in july a medicine hat citizens com tal
 board john niblock had been brewing for mittee was formed with former editor drinnan some time this blow would be
 followed in sepas secretar y james hargrave who was chosen tember by the termination of calder s contr act to
 serve as chairman was the progeny of a fa as cpr surgeon in his appeal to the cpr vice mous
 fur trading family as well as an established president calder wrote and successful merchant and rancher he had ar i
 would simply say that mr nibloek s accusation dereliction of dutyl is false he knew it was false rived in
 the little community dunng its first year when he made it he made it simply through malice hargrave s committee
 drew the support of a num it is on a par with many of his actions to other citizens ber
 of prominent medicine hatters including of this town in the past founding father william cousins dr j g meanwhile superintendent
 nibhock through calder james p mitchell the town s barrister his lawyer james lougheed of calgar y filed an francis
 fart the postmaster fatt s father in law injunction against the publication of the petition merchant lewis cochran isabella bassett
 being circulated throughout the town by the proprietor of the cosmopolitan hotel james f citizens committee this delayed the committee
 sanderson respected businessman baker only temporarily for it was soon put aside when michael leonard the town s leading roman
 william cousins had his own legal firm make catholic citizen and a large number of district arrangements to dissolve the
 suit thus during ranchers the intention of the committee was to the first week of august messrs cousins gather names
 on a petition to be sent on to wil calder and saloon owner victor st george travelled to montreal to
 lay their 76 name petition before william van home to complicate matter s william finlay another founding father of the
 community and a successful lumber merchant forwarded on august 2 nd his letter to the cpr headquarters with a counter
 petition this petition read in part we your petitioners who consider mr niblock as our best citizen and friend and
 feel that he is being hounded and persecuted by an unprincipled clique humbly beg that no action will be taken
 until after a sworn investigation into all the facts of the case like the first petition this counter petition also
 carried the names of many of the town s leading figures thomas l tweed m l a signed fir st
 followed by his close friend and brother presbyterian william t finlay w n adsit butcher albert hughes druggist j c
 colter contractor and numerous merchants farmers ranchers and railway men made up the 127 names on this petition which was
 mailed to montreal james lougheed analyzed events surrounding the petitions this way the cousins movement emanates from a very small
 section of the community many names are those of boys or dismissed workmen from the company or of parties arriving
 in medicine hat and who without j g calder came to medicine hat to run the hospital and the least
 difficulty might be induced to sign anything work for the cpr but he soon became caught up in the presented
 to them niblock drinnan controversy in a letter to shaughnessy written almost simul original petitioners william cousins james taneously general
 superintendent whyte des hargrave dr calder the mitchell brother s j k cribed the motives behind the crisis drinnan the
 yuihl brothers and many others it is difficult for me to understand mr cousins mo were active worshippers in the
 pro niblock lives i may say that i knew this young man in the camp rev stephens faced each sunday
 the likes east before he removed to medicine hat and 1 have watched his career in medicine hat and i
 believe i of w t finlay thomas tweed ezra pearson am safe in saying that begets a large share of
 the rail sam hayward and their supporters he found it way trade i understand that all the staff in the
 offices impossible not to become involved in this and station at medicine hat deal with him dispute it is unfortunate
 that whyte did not attempt to the town was upset with local politics and as mr find some cause other
 than merely the economic stephens did not see why he should conceal his opinone true the hospital board would stand
 ac ions he made enemies among his congregation and cused in the community for giving the firm of be a
 cause of dissention he quietly tweed and ewart a major share of the general thus it was that families and
 organizations supplies purchased by the hospital but it is ob alike were divided over the issue little wonder vious that
 the extreme nature of the alienation that the newspaper s new editor fred forster rested on more than that the
 railway officials in winnipeg and montreal refused to believe that deemed it unnecessary to raise again the matter of incorporation
 for the town he said his last the town was in as much turmoil as it obviously word in that

 the town s two foremost leaders clearly head and shoulders above the others broke publically with each other there was
 little hope for advancement until reconciliation was reached and even thereafter the rancour would remain to eat away at the
 town other important factors unquestionably were at work which impeded the town s growth a north south railway through medicine
 hat connecting the american border settlements to the 5 edmonton region was long planned for and never realized this might
 have assured medicine hat s status as a regional railway headquarters rather than losing this advantage to calgary as it
 did 6 in 1899 had the canadian pacific railway proceeded with its massive irrigation scheme on its land holdings between
 medicine hat and calgar y things would surely have been different if the railway corporation had been pursuaded to use
 medicine hat coal for its transcontinental trains rather than its reliance on the galt resource at lethbridge this could have
 been a major impetus to development by the l 890 s it was abundantly clear that the james hargras e

 devoid of all curiosity he us sinners i ain t no sinner i never stole no neither sought information nor
 imparted it horse i never stole nothing what harm was it maunsell however did elicit from him that he selling
 a bottle of whisky had left tennessee some thirty years before but maunsell did the best he could to explain
 mr he did not seem to know the names of the other manning s calling but evidently tennessee in states
 and territories he had been in and he had his vast wanderings and lack of inquiring into never been engaged
 in any other business but other people s business had never met a preacher fishing and shooting he was very

 no visible spiritual change took place wife for a minute he sighed well go ahead mr manning met a type
 of men he had never mr o neil he said i suppose we must get met before they nearly all
 followed an occupa to benton but we re going to cover our ears tion that required a command of a
 certain lan and o neil commenced never was there such guage many of the men were unkempt and an astonished
 team they seemed surprised at resembled pirates and there was nothing in their being addressed in such a manner but
 they language to dispel this illusion but they were quickly responded and pulled the wagon out with not after all
 bad men some of them were men a jerk and the mannings got to benton safely of considerable mentality they
 thought that and out of a country which was all to the strenbeing honest honorable and helpful to those in
 uous life and apparently little left for the spiritual distress was sufficient and they certainly lived before maunsell left for
 his cabin after his terup to that religion their language however left rible experience he gave to d w davis
 his letter much to be desir ed and it must have startled mr of credit which was sent to helena
 and after manning when first he heard it not only was some delay it was cashed as ed and his
 brother it profane but it was original they were full of had little or nothing to do until their cattle
 arrived strange oaths much more startling than those of they conceived the idea of engaging in farming the sterotyped kind
 but unfortunately there were no farming imple the man that could use the choicest and most ments to be obtained
 both boys and allen had varied profanity was jack o neil 2 who sue each a small stubble plow which
 they kindly ceeded farwell as mail carrier to benton as he offered to lend but the maunsells had no horse
 carried passengers when occasion required he strong enough to break the sod dignified his humble conveyance by the name of
 desolate though a new country may be there stage mr manning s health had failed and is always a friend
 in need and he turned up in he decided to go back east accompanied by mrs the shape of one
 bill barton a freighter bill manning they took passage with o neil as far broke four acr es for the
 boys and borrowing two as benton where a boat heft every few weeks sacks of oats from the mounted police
 they scatduring the summer tered the contents on the land but reserved a mr manning must have known of jack
 s rhe quarter of an acre for potatoes they obtained torical powers for before they left the minister 50 pounds
 of these for seed paying 10 for them said now jack i want you to be very careful the history
 of the maunsells first potato crop during this trip and r efr ain fr om pr ofanity i know is
 interesting enough to follow through right till you are used to that sort of language but i am harvesting the
 lads did not consider and rightly in poor health and my nerves simply will not so that plain sod was
 good enough for the growstand it ing of really good spuds so they chopped up the jack promised and kept
 his word by remaining sod with spades and then dug the whole plot over practically dumb until they were within
 a few to the depth of six inches this made a fine bed miles of benton there the horses and
 the wag and great pains were taken in planting the seed 14 4 j ‘ ‘ s 4 t f
 ‘ z ‘ ‘ ‘ during maunsell s earl sears fort iacleod ssas a one street frontier communit facing the
 mounted police fort it is seen here in the 1870 s the season was wet and the potatoes made rapid
 toes as the eyes of a sun worshipper turns toward growth no young mother could have been more that glowing
 orb in the heavens but this one excited over the appearance of her infant s first morning the wonderful plants
 had a queer look tooth than were the maunsells over the appear maunsell knew the blight and its effects in
 ance of the first potato shoot not only was it ireland his first thought was that the blight had their
 initial effort at farming but they had not struck them he hastened toward the patch and tasted a vegetable for
 nearly a year not even found every plant withered but it was not the canned ones the sprouts were carefully
 hilled blight it was the blighting indians a large party up in course of time and about the middle of
 of them had come up in the night pulled up ever y july they scratched away the earth to see
 how stalk and taken all the potatoes whether they the blessed potatoes were getting on they were thought they would
 temper the wind to the shorn only the size of marbles in a week s time they lamb or that
 a second crop would come from took another scratch round the same stalk and the new planted haulms it is
 not known but every decided that as the tuber s had so incr eased in size plant had been carefully
 placed back in the soil to promise themselves a feed on the first of and the earth heaped around them
 mr maun august sell in telling the story dr aws a discr eet veil over the boys looked forward to
 that banquet in what was said by his brother and himself fact they dreamed about it waking and sleeping the
 oat crop was more successful and the they sat in their leisure time and discussed maunsells managed to get it
 harrowed with a potatoes they talked of boiled potatoes fried home made harrow borrowed from dick potatoes french fried cottage
 fried scalloped kennefick potatoes chipped potatoes potatoes in ever y to my surprise i had an excellent crop and it
 conceivable way make shape and form but seemed marvellous to me how it r esisted drought i above all notatoes
 allowed ito ripen and threshed it out with a hand flail the grain i sold to the police for six
 cents a on going out of the shack one morning their pound i came to the conclusion that this country
 eyes instinctively turned toward the field of pota would prove as successful for grain growing as for 15 stock growing
 the only reason i did not then engage broken into and a large part of their sack of flour in
 farming extensively was the absence of market we had to depend entirely on the mounted police two stolen after this
 the door was not locked but other settlers had engaged in farming the same time every time a load of
 rails was hauled home a as i did and as the mounted police required a very fire was put in
 the stove and a kettle filled with limited amount of oats we feared that this market would be soon over
 supplied however as long as water this gave the indians the impression that that market was there i continued breaking
 up a few their former hosts were chose by and nothing was moe acres each year stolen for a time
 that worked well until the wily it was about this time that the settlers in the red man got wise
 to the trick countr y were greatly bothered with the indians both men had to be away to get the
 rails and the buffalo having dwindled down and left both so it was decided to keep only a small stock
 of the blood and the peigan indians were camped provisions and carty them with them wherever in the vicinity of
 fort macleod hoping the they went the door was left open and as the government would feed them mr maunsell
 is indians stole nothing but food again all was unable to say in giving his opiniqn whether the right but
 the policy of a short stock and with indian commissioner edgar dewdney or the the ravages made by those who
 had nothing government deserved censure but mr dewdney necessitated a trip to macleod every few days kept promising day after
 day that they would be and this led to a very uncomfortable experience fed and the indians promptly named him
 it was june at that time and some very hot apinau kusi which means tomorrow if weather was being experienced
 ed set out for dewdney had told them that it was impossible macleod one day on horseback and found the
 to get food in at that time the indians would have river had risen unusually high and as he knew
 scattered out and would have done better than it was not fordable and did not know much about being camped
 around macleod swimming a horse he had to return on the way it was a sad sight to see the
 indians all over he called at boys place intending to borrow the prairie snaring gophers for food the maun some
 bacon and flour boys was in no better sells trouble with the indians started through plight mistaken hospitality on their
 part one day a fine allison and i are both out he told maunlooking indian came to the house and
 he was sell i thought you had been to the store and given a meal and a smoke of tobacco
 the next that we could borrow from you day at the same time he appeared again this time maunsell went
 home feeling hungr y because accompanied by his squaw and child they were all the food they had in the
 house was bread fed naturally the indian went back and spread enough for two meals and a little bacon grease
 the good news throughout the indian camp that also there was no tobacco they went to the there was a
 white man who did not turn indians river and caught some pike which did for supper away hungr y and
 breakfast next morning but they were no sooner would the boys make their fire at already tired of pike and
 though they found them noon to cook a meal but the indians would nauseating they had to eat fish or
 nothing beobserve the smoke and regard it as a signal by lieving they would be better if dried and smoked
 the time they sat down to eat there would be a a number were caught cleaned and nailed to the
 dozen starving savages watching with greedy south side of the house to dry faces every bite the boys put to
 their mouths the the curlews were nesting at the time and these maunsells could not afford to feed them neither
 were looked upon as a possible change in diet could they eat in front of the poor starving here again
 luck was against them they had lots wretches during that time they were hauling of shot but only three charges
 of powder for they fence rails and to save time and disappointment used to load their own shells however three
 for the visitors they took cold bacon and bread curlew were obtained with the three shells and to eat in
 the bush this worked well for a while these were cut in small pieces and boiled to make as it
 was at noon they always came but again a soup here at least they were somewhat fortuthere was trouble returning
 from a trip one day nate in laying in a small stock of food that night the maunsell boys found
 that the house had been the wind veered to the north and a terrific rain 16 set in and get
 away from the drip for it still rained in thei e was only a light covering of earth on the
 the house for some time afterwards by a tacit roof and a lot of that had blown off during the
 agreement the maunsell brothers held no converwinter by midnight the insistent rain found en sation they would glare at each
 other occasiontrance to the house from the roof it was impos ally but one word would have probably precipisible to
 light the lamps as a stream of water had tated a fight in the matter of food they were simpoured
 in and soaked the wicks the blankets ply up against it all they had was dried pike were protected with
 their slickers but the unfor it was impossible to get fresh the sloughs were tunate settlers could not protect their
 heads they raging rivers and fishing was out of the question passed the night in misery when daylight came they
 tried pike boiled they tried them baked they spread some fence poles on the floor made they tried them hot
 and they tried them cold the beds on them put the tables at a slant over but they found them
 nauseating in any way the the pillows spread the slickers over the blankets wretched men had no set time for
 meals but and crawled in for a sleep through the day would take a mouthful now and when they woke
 it was nearly noon and it was then nor did they go near their neighbors boys a wretched sight that
 met their eyes the house and allison they were afraid they might have presented a most desolate appearance the floor
 a little grub left and force the boys to share with made of hardened clay had been worn into holes
 them and these were full of water it was impossible in a few days the river went down to an
 ordito make a tire they drank some of the curlew nary flood and ed rode to the ford in the
 hopes soup ate a little dried fish and smoked not the police would put in a boat but the force
 had tobacco but tea as it was all they had its own troubles to attend to several houses of the
 rain continued for three solid days it came the old town had been washed away but the fort down in
 torrents the second day they could not was intact so the fish diet had to continue for tell where the
 original river was it had flowed a while and the boys were beginning to get might all over the bottom

 rode across in the hopes of pieces of it in installments and devoured it with getting some grub from whoever
 was there he their bacon which was soon r eady it was a meal found it was a surveyor s
 party under the charge never to be forgotten they simply ate and ate of a p patrick 3 but in
 interviewing mr then they ate again but never a man spoke a patrick his hopes fell word it was an
 occasion too solemn too sacred what s the chance of getting a boat across too beautiful for words a look
 was enough ed asked patrick we are nearly out of beamed at george and george at ed provisions the banquet
 was over the plug of tobacco was at this ed knew it was no use telling patrick produced the pipes
 were filled and lit for some the desperate position he and his brother were minutes they smoked in a delicious
 silence then in just then out of the tent came a man whom a conversation started and if they had
 not seen maunsell knew well it was l hugill 4 he was each other for 20 years they could hardly
 have told of the condition the boys were in and that said more to one another than they did then
 the they were practically starving discomfort and the misery of the past days were we are not that low that
 we cannot spare you entirely forgotten after a couple of pipefuls they something said hugill and handed out a decided
 to visit boys and allison and invite them generous chunk of bacon some flour baking over to supper but they
 had not fared so badly powder and a plug of tobacco allison had plenty of flour though nothing else stop
 and eat with us said the kindly hugill both men were out of tobacco of course they seeing the almost
 wolfish hunger in the boy were delighted to see their visitors face as he fondled the bacon and smelled the
 a few days after this the police put in a boat tobacco and the settlers were enabled to get to
 the store can t do it hugill thank you said ed one effect the starvation had on them was that
 for two reasons i have a starving brother at they were able to see the point of view of the
 home and i don t want to make an exhibition noble red man and that they were brothers under of
 myself before you fellows with my ravenous the skin when it came to needing the daily eats appetite i tell
 you frankly i d eat a horse if he the maunsells would have stolen themselves had would lay down they
 found a place to steal from and something hugill laughed off you go he said and to steal get to
 the deuce out of this and feed your face my cattle an ived in june 79 and at the same
 time maunsell packed the precious food on his sad others brought in small bands the names of these were bell

 another visit but at least they had it transpired that olsen was trying to sell his been decent enough not
 to clean them out they hand to the indian department as the surroundhad left enough bacon tea sugar and flour
 for ing country had been selected by the peigan ina couple of meals nothing else was taken but dians for
 their reserve and if he was successful an illustrated bible in his plan olsen intended taking his cattle if fearing
 the cattle might take it into their heads there were any left to montana he advised the to start running
 again after feeding ed maun maunsehls to do the same in his anxiety maunsell decided to herd them that night
 but to his sell went and spoke to others on the subject and delight they laid down and commenced to
 chew saw joe mcfarland morgan who was looking their cuds so he learned his first lesson in han after mrs
 armstrong s cattle french sam bell dling range cattle he saw that the reason they and patterson john miller and
 j b smith all were so wild was because they were thirsty and of whom had cattle at that time
 they decided hungry and that a full stomach made for content to interview col macleod tell him their troument and
 contentment is a great gain bles and see if the police could do anything for having got the cattle located
 so well near the them cabin the lads thought that ranching would prove the interview was not satisfactory if you
 can a most charming industry but in a few weeks identify the indians who killed your cattle they things did
 not look quite so rosy they counted will be punished said the colonel this was the herd and found they
 were several head short of course quite impossible most of the bloods believing they had wandered away the country and
 peigans were camped in the vicinity of fort was scoured but there was no trace of them macleod and selected
 the night time for killing olsen their neighbor was interviewed on the cattle subject and his advice sought said the
 spokesman of the deputation if we it is not likely you will ever see them again put all our cattle
 together herd them during the he said there is no doubt the indians have day and corral them at night
 can we defend our 19 property if the indians come to kill them the government s own price but dewdney
 refused if any of you fellows kill an indian he will to buy saying he had no authority to make
 such certainly be hanged was col macleod s only a deal with this rather black outlook the majority answer to
 this of those with cattle interests decided to quit and then will we receive compensation for the take the cattle
 back to montana the maunsells cattle killed by the indians was the next started to round up their herd and
 out of the 103 question head they paid duty on they only found 56 and no he answered this country
 is not open the other cattlemen lost in the same proportion for settlement and you brought the cattle in en
 they started for montana in the early fall and tirely at your own risk under olsen s advice the cattle
 were left at a that was the best satisfaction the harrassed place named willow rounds where sol abbott ranchers could
 get though col macleod was a settler lived this was the south side of the marmuch criticised for this statement
 there is no ias river duty had to be paid on the cattle to doubt that he acted for the
 best he really wanted the american customs but what the maunsells the cattle to be taken out of the country
 they felt most as british subjects and ex members of would breed trouble for a starving indian was the mounted
 police were the remarks made in not going to be conscious stricken on the matter fort benton where the cattle
 were declared and of ownership when his stomach cried cupboard duty paid was that they had to come to uncle
 had the ranchers remained in the country at that sam for protection not desiring to live permatime either an indian
 or a white man would have nently in montana the cattle were left in the care been killed and if

 there was some difficulty in getting the cattle ing with several young men in ireland who across the river as
 the ice was only partly out desired to engage in ranching and were only and when they were safely landed
 for the first awaiting favorable word to come out this of hour or so maunsell was able to follow the
 trail course would have induced others to come and as he could see it through the snow but the inthe
 country would have rapidly filled with a class tense glare of the sun on the snow soon comof small stockmen
 menced to affect his eyes the sky was clear and with the ranching prospects gone at least for blue and
 as generally happens after an april a time there was nothing for it but to engage in storm of that
 nature there was not a cloud to be farming a breaking plow was bought and about seen in a little
 while he could no longer see the 30 acres of sod turned to the sun and wind the trail he
 had to keep his eyes almost closed but lads were afraid to break more as they had to he contented
 himself with the thought that he was depend on the scythe for cutting this land was going in the right
 direction after travelling for sown to oats in the spring of 1880 the crop did some time he was surprised
 to hear someone well a very favorable season was experienced speak to him in the indian language he underand enough
 oats were sold to the police to bring stood enough to explain where he was going and in 1 200
 the crop was threshed with flails and he was told that he was heading str aight west for winnowed in
 the never failing alberta breeze the mountains the indian drove the cattle for other settlers adopted the age old method
 of plac some time until they came to where there were ing the oats in a corral and letting the
 horses five or six more indians and by that time poor thresh them out this was quicker but not as
 maunsell could hardly see a foot beyond him good as flailing the indians then took him to standoff to dutch

 again it was the snow tially blind fred bound his eyes and put on a which nearly caused him to
 lose his eyesight and poultice of tea heaves which gave him some his life a man who was travelling from
 sun relief all maunsell could do was to arrange with river to macleod had told the brothers that he dutch
 to take care of the cattle for a time and had seen three head of their cattle near the mouth
 then hired the indian to take him home it was of lee s creek where cardston now is the certainly
 most providential that the indian had animals had evidently escaped the observation of found the wandering man he was heading

 near a search party would of course have been sent where the upper blood agency was later built out there
 would have been no chance of finding staying the night he started for lee creek the the tracks and owing
 to the condition the river next day following a faint trail which led to sun was in they would have
 most naturally concluded river it was evening before maunsell finally that he had been drowned it was several weeks found
 his cattle as they were across the st before ed recovered his sight his eyes caused mary s river all
 he could do was to stay there him most excrutiating pain he found that bathfor the night cochrane had given
 him some ing them in cold tea gave him a good deal of cooked bacon and br ead so he
 did not far e badly relief for grub the weather had been warm during the there was very little settlement
 added to that day but in the night it started to snow though part of the country owing to the
 loss of cattle the weather was not cold the searcher regretted the most important thing that occurred shortly he had
 not gone to the jew s cabin the man who after was that the indians occupied their reserves had succored
 the party on the last trip by the and the government provided for feeding them time morning dawned there were
 several feet of the few settlers that had squatted on the reserves snow on the ground but the weather had
 cleared had their rights bought by the government while 21 no doubt the disappearance of the buffalo had in the
 earlier days with indeed a few traces of caused much hardship at first to the indians it green in his
 eye even then edward maunsell was no doubt beneficial in the long run and aided went into some detail as
 to what they should and in the settlement of the country otherwise the should not do even to the point
 of insulting their indians would never have been content to settle intelligence but at that as it turned out later
 he on the reserves was not sufficiently explicit because of this settlement and the brightening they had purchased a team
 and a democrat of the outlook the two young farmers decided wagon also a tent and some cooking utensils to
 g t their cattle back to the country this was as nothing could be more disastrous than losing in 1881
 miller who was in charge of the herd horses on the prairie the englishmen were at willow rounds wrote to
 say that he could turn strongly impressed with the necessity of picketthem over some time in july when the roundup
 ing their horses and as an extra precaution they was over as at this time another of the maun were
 advised to hobble them so far so good sell boys h f had decided to come to alberta they were
 then told about getting a fire and and throw in his lot with the early pioneers it given to understand
 that whenever they camped was therefore arranged to meet him in fort ben near water they would always find plenty
 of ton and then bring the cattle back with them the buffalo chips but for fear the weather might be
 two started for benton some time in june but wet a few sticks of cord wood were to be inthe
 rivers being very high at that time of the year eluded in the outfit the englishmen were told they were
 unable to follow the bull team trail they could get this at a place called the leavings between macheod and
 benton for the first 40 where the road turned north toward macleod miles the trip to fort benton was made
 without maunsell heard nothing more about these incident the travellers crossed the belly river gentlemen until he returned to macleod
 his at the coal banks known later as the sheran brother hf having arrived in the meantime his mines a
 man named sheran took them across neighbor allison had a lot to say about them in a boat to the
 opposite bank where lethbridge he had been to benton to buy some farm now stands and from ther e they
 followed the st machinery and the evening before he arrived mary s river till the benton trail was reached there
 he had met the two oxford scholars they where they met a large party of surveyors on its were camped
 at the time and had collected an way to calgar y to locate the cpr through the enormous amount of
 buffalo chips and were mountains engaged in trying to light a fire the pair were h f maunsell had not
 arrived when the two on their knees with a stick of cordwood between brothers reached fort benton but they had
 the them and had burnt an astonishing number of pleasure of meeting col james walker that matches trying to ignite

 kindling for them and made a the interests of the cochrane ranch the pioneer fire the oxford men stood by
 in stark amazeof the large ranching companies ed maunsell ment my word ‘ sprisin was their comment had served under
 walker in the police on the wonder of these backwoodsmen while waiting the arrival of their brother from fellows the
 old country maunsell met two englishmen allison camped with them the night and tried who were on their way to
 macleod the younger to mother them a little the poor chaps had lost of the two men appeared to be
 a wealthy in their tent first crack out of the box it must have dividual and it transpir ed in
 the conver sation that dropped off soon after leaving benton as allison he was the son of the then british
 ambassador never saw any sign of it on the way in maunsell to france he had recently left oxford and
 was in giving directions about hobbling and picketaccompanied by an older friend who was an ing the horses had omitted
 some directions the oxford tutor both were charming men and picket pins were only driven a few yards apart highly
 educated the education they possessed with the result that the hor ses got into a bad tangle however did not
 include knowledge of how best and in the morning the team was found nearly to travel on the prairie knowing
 his own verdanty choked to death and at the last gasp 22 upon the arrival of h f maunsell the
 three pened who should walk up but the ver y man who brothers started for the old agency now called
 had committed two foul murders and for all he choteau they traveled up the teton river knew three the girl
 at once recognized him and through a country devoid of settlement until they screamed there s the man who killed
 my got to within 30 miles of choteau there the first mother signs of settlement seen was the remains of
 a the stockmen surrounded and seized him house that had just been burned down they did they searched him and
 besides having a lot of not know when looking at the desolate scene that money in his possession he also
 had a gold a terrible tragedy had occurred there which they watch which was recognized as belonging to had missed
 by only a few hours it was not until morgan the evidence was sufficient so some they arrived at the
 old agency that they found new rope was got from the store a loop placed out what has occurred around
 the murderer s neck and he was hauled it appeared that mrs armstrong and morgan to a cottonwood tree here
 the man was hanged had left macleod in 1879 and settled on the teton and he had just been cut
 down and buried as the with mrs armstrong was a little adopted girl maunsells arrived about eight or nine years
 of age the day before miller who had charge of the maunsell herd the three maunsells happened along a man
 came was at the old agency and he said the round up there on foot and asked for work he
 was hired would not be finished for a couple of days the the house was a two story one mrs
 armstrong cattle could not be got till that was done the and the little girl slept upstairs which was boys
 decided to follow the work and learn somereached by a ladder while morgan slept on the thing of the business
 they found cattlemen at ground floor work a splendid type of men many of them the little girl who had
 gone to picket her hor se had been engaged in r anching for some years and and was r eturning
 to the house to go to bed heard had recently brought their stock to the sun river a shot she
 crept quietly to the house and looking and teton ranges the work finished they acin at the door spied morgan
 struggling convul companied miller to willow rounds where the sively on the bed he was dying the newly hired cattle
 were turned over the little herd of 56 man stood by with a rifle in his hand intent only which
 had been entrusted to miller in 1879 had on his murderous work dwindled to less than 50 miller accounted for
 the girl heard mrs armstrong cry out this by saying there had been a great epidemic what s the matter
 of blackleg amongst the calves the previous year there s a coyote after your turkeys said the which explained the
 fact that the maunsells had murderer at this mrs armstrong commenced no yearlings they knew it was a fatal disease
 to descend the ladder the man shot her in the but did not know it would attack one brand of
 back cattle and leave another alone miller s herd frightened out of her senses the little girl ran seemed to
 have more than the average number and hid in some bush she evidently was unnoticed of yearlings but still they
 were glad to get back by the murderer he likely thinking she was up what was left and get back
 to canada stairs asleep after a little time she saw the house in october of 1881 ed maunsell was sumcommence
 to burn and the man walk away just moned as a juror on a murder trial which was as soon
 as he was well out of sight the girl got the first trial for murder which took place in the
 her horse and rode with all speed the nearest north west territory since the arrival of the neighbor a man
 named mcdevitt he lived mounted police in the fall of 1879 a policeman about 16 miles away to him she
 related the named graburn was found dead in the cypr ess ghastly story and in the morning mcdevitt dr ove
 hills he was shot in the back graburn was a her to the old agency as one of the owners
 of young man of a most amiable disposition and it the stor e hamilton was a deputy sheriff arriving was
 hard to find a motive for killing him as there they found that the stockmen of the teton there were
 very few white men outside of the round up had just arrived police at fort walsh at that time it
 was easy while mcdevitt was relating what had hap by a process of elimination to decide that 23 graburn had
 been killed by an indian two life amongst the indians and knew their character theories were advanced to account for
 a cause thoroughly he said that the indians did not regard the killing of a white man or an indian
 of a hostile for the murder one was that he was killed in tribe as a crime but rather as
 an achievement to boast mistake for another policeman who may have about and that consequently it was possible that star
 had an indian enemy the other that he might child especially as he was only a boy might have lied
 and said he killed grabum gladstone was inhave been killed by an indian who had a dined to this opinion
 on account of the inadequate grievance against the police fdrce much satis cause which star child was supposed to give
 as his reason for killing grabum faction was felt in 1881 when it was reported that of course i do
 not emember all the arguments we the indian that killed graburn had been arrested used but we came to the
 conclusion that thee wee and had confessed to the crime the indian s great doubts of star child s guilt
 one of the jurors name was star child however held out for conviction he argued that this was the first
 murder that had been committed in the north west territory since the arrival of the police star child was tried
 about the middle of october and if we acquitted star child and it should happen 1881 before judge macleod nearly
 every civilian in the country at that time was summoned for the jury he was guilty the indians would have
 nothing but i think all jury men thought there would be no trial contempt of the white man s laws
 and no settler s life would be safe he finally agreed however to conas reports had it that star child
 had confessed to the sent to an acquittal crime and would plead guilty to our surprise however he pleaded not
 guilty i don t claim that this jury was infallible but i do claim that the only reason we acquitted
 star child was a jury was selected the following being their names that we considered the evidence insufficient as a
 matand occupations william gladstone car penter ter of fact it required greater courage to acquit star charles ryan ex policeman
 salesman at i g baker child than convict him accoi 1 ing to rumors we heart store dan horan ex
 policeman who had just esta before the trial there seemed little doubt of his guilt blished a shoe making business
 william parker ex there is no doubt the verdict we gave was not a policeman who was working for joe
 mcfarlane and owned no cattle at that time e h maunsell ex popular one the whole country was cr ying
 out for policeman stock owner the name of the sixth juror vengeance and as i said before according to rumors
 star child seemed certainly guilty but as happens ire i cannot recall but i am pretty sure he was an
 expoliceman and i am certain he was not a stockman quently the evidence heard at a murder tnal is not
 always as strong as the rumors heard previously the first witness called was an indian of the same whether we
 made an error in our verdict it certainly tribe as the prisoner he stated that star child told was no
 cowardice that dictated it him that he had killed grabum asked if star child gave any eason for doing so
 he replied that star child in ‘ 81 the indians were located on their said that he and the policeman
 were riding together reserves and were being well fed by the governin the cypress hills that they came to a
 miry place ment so maunsell thought it was safe to bring and the policeman was afraid to cross it star
 child then took the lead but his horse refused to enter and his cattle back the only others who did
 so were the policeman struck him behind with a rope this bell patterson maunsell had no difficulty in so annoyed
 star child that when they went some dis locating his cattle close to his house and had no tance further
 he shot and killed the policeman fears for the winter as he had lots of oat straw some other witnesses
 were called who were able to identify star child as being an indian seen round little of which he fed
 as the winter of ‘ 81 82 was fort walsh dunng the summer and fall of ‘ 79 judge a
 very mild one he felt fully convinced that macleod then charged the jury he told us we were stock growing
 would more than fulfil his expecunder oath to give our verdict according to the evidence and if we had any
 reasonable doubt we should tations he thought he would be fully justified give the prisoner the benefit of it he
 charged us to in advising his friends in ireland to come to this pay no attention to rumors we may
 have heard about country but postponed doing so as he had heard this case and to confine ourselves entirely to
 the evidence we heard in court he wamed us to get rid of by a mere chance that the government
 had inprejudice on account of the murdered man being a troduced a leasing system and he wanted to bewhite man
 and the pnsoner being an indian the jury come informed about this before writing to his then retired to consider
 their verdict while i have no one to corroborate me in what friends occurred in the jury room still i
 will relate what hap there was no one in this country from whom i could pened the evidence that star
 child was seen round obtain information so i wrote to a friend in ottawa fort walsh did not help us
 much because there were asking him to make inquiries and at the same time several hundred indians camped arcund there
 at the apply fora small lease in my name taking in the land same time we were reduced therefore to
 the evidence on which my cattle ran to my constemation the reply of the indian who said star child had
 said he had i got was that all the country for many miles surroundkilled grabum william gladstone was asked his
 ing fort macleod had been already leased with the opinion about this gladstone had lived mostly all his exception of
 a few sections situated where the present 24 was possible where cattle were running on the open in westem canada
 they found that while the leasing system had been adopted it was not satisfactory in ‘ 82 an immense amount
 of country had been leased to speculators who held their leases for high prices also the leases were too large
 most of them covering a hundred thousand acres the terms of the lease was range when these men looked to
 the range country not attractive it was unreasonable to expect a man 1 to come from the old country or
 any other place and t invest his money in cattle go to the expense of building residence for himself and
 family fence his lease and erect shelters for his stock and feel that at any time the govemment could cancel
 his lease by giving two years notice had we been fortunate at that time i to have had a minister
 of the interior possessing some vision there is no doubt in my mind that all that coun try which we
 call the range country would have become j jf ‘ rapidly settled by small stockmen these men would have done
 as i was doing and other pioneer cattle i men cultivated some land to grow winter feed for their stock
 had the govemment limited the size of the leases to a moderate acreage and left out the cancellation clause they
 would have created ideal conditions but what did the govemment do instead of encouraging the small stockman the man who
 would have become a real settler their policy resulted in practically throw i ing the entire range country into the
 hands of a few immense ranch companies the only small stockman who started in ‘ 82 was mr d j
 grier who also was an ex policeman he squatted close to me which was somewhat risky as the land on
 which he settled was leased to a speculator he was not disturbed however grier immedi star c hild sas accused
 of murdering a mounted police ately engaged in grain growing and we ran our cattle man but a jury which
 included edward maunsell together as long as conditions permitted declared him to be innocent star child later became a for
 a year or two at any hour we wished we could police scout see our cattle if any required feeding
 in the winter town of macleod is built an excellent place no doubt they were within easy reach and any
 cows that were for a townsite but not attractive for a stock ranch calving early could be placed under shelter
 fearing that whoever owned the lease on which my this was soon all changed the large ranch comcattle were running
 might quickly come along and panics came in the result of which was that ‘ 83 was eject me i
 took a lease on this gravel bed i was not the last year i saw my cattle together thenearesi disturbed
 however as the party who owned the lease large ranch to me was the oxley company they had was merely
 a speculator he subsequently sold it to acquired several hundred thousand acres of lease part the waldron ranch in fact
 very few of those who by grant part by purchase on this they tumed loose applied for leases had any
 intention of stocking them many thousand cattle which immediately scattered they were acquired for the purpose of sale in all
 directions and grier s and mine became mixed i found that they were all huge leases and were with them
 no effort on our part could prevent this held at first at a high figure i could not advise my
 all the large companies endeavoured to conduct friends to come here i knew no place where they ranching same as
 was pursued in more southem councould settle without trespassing on a lease none of tries no effort was made to
 provide feed for their them were men with such large capit al as could affoni weak stock in the winter
 and i had to follow suit it to buy those large leases and even if they could the was useless
 after this for me to put up any feed for terms would not justify them to relinquish their busi cattle
 for when the time came when they would reness in the old country and invest their capital in a quire
 it the cattle would be so scattered that they could lease which might be cancelled in two years a not
 be found the only advantage which the ranch golden opportunity was lost as this time for filling companies derived from
 their leases was they were the country with a fine class of settlers canadians allowed to bring in cattle from
 the u s free of duty and old countrymen and prevent settlers from squatting on their leases the ranching country
 in the u s did not attract some of these companies had close to haifa million them these men would
 want to have their cattle under acres under lease none of which were ever fully control they would want to
 provide feed during the stocked instead of this leasing system being an imwinter and breed a type they preferred none
