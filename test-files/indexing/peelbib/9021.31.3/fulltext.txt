 the central in wars outside of canada they then asked powers military service was not compulsory in said morris that
 they should not be sent to war canada at that time and therefore all enlisted men and i told them

 precedent for rela for indians tions with the indians in the event of war canada reactions to the military service
 act were imcould not morally ask them to enlist therefore mediately forthcoming from the indians any indian who did enlist
 did so voluntarily themselves some indians spoke out against the recruiting campaigns at the outbreak of world act believing that
 since they did not have the war one were started unofficially on some same rights and privileges of citizenship as
 other reserves and an official believed that many more canadians they should not be included in the would enlist if
 a special effort were made to military service act but if they were given these secure them 3 two months

 when he first enlisted albert mountain europe horse wrote i am going forth to fight for my samuel middleton a
 missionary on the king and country 23 his brother mike mounreserve had influenced mountain horse s deci tam horse viewed
 his own enlistment as a belief sion and because of this the bloods thought the in the cause of the
 great white father and to priest had betrayed them and caused them to prove that the fighting spirit had not

 countr y this belief was held because a blood believed that the indians compared the the bloods remembered their 1877
 treaty in situation with the old days when they were gowhich they were to throw away their guns and ing
 on the war path 25 for many indians the let the great white queen protect them 21 the fact that
 their treaties had been made with queen victoria gave them a particular bond with the spicious gallantry one unique hardship
 which british crown at the outbreak of the war some hit the indians in particular was tuberculosis indians said that
 the queen s grandson needed since they did not have any natural immunity to their help it seems that the
 loyalty mention the disease it killed many who returned home ed by government officials was really a loyalty after the
 war to the king of england rather than to canada if the letters received by the indian department also the
 thrill of adventure and the recalling of were an indication of indian spirit it was very the old days ranked
 higher than any loyalty to high the annual report for 1917 made note of canada the fact that the department
 receives testimonials language was a common problem among of loyalty from indian bands and letters from native enlistees since many
 indians were un individual indians which are fired with a zealous familiar with english at first and communication and sincere
 patriotism and often display a highly was difficult in addition they often had little intelligent interest in the progress of
 the war and knowledge of the cause and effect or the character a remarkably clear grasp of the principles which
 of the war once in the army it was hard for them are at stake 32 to accept military discipline

 indians in the first step was taken in 1917 when amendments military aspect of the war effort were comparable were
 niade to the indian act section 90 subto that of other canadians the major difference sections 2 and 3 the
 government claimed that was that indians were not required or expected many reserves were too large to be completely to
 serve but they did so with gallantry and valor utilized by the indians and if they were not will when
 war was declared canadians geared ing to sell these lands they would be leased to whites for farming and grazing
 purposes themselves for wartime production and this more to the point sub sec 2 of the amendment country s indians
 were no exception their most obvious contribution was in the field of gave the government the power to deal with
 the council of a band who through some delusion or agriculture although they also were involved in other forms of
 production and war work mtsapprehension acts in a manner contrary to the best interests of the band and refuses to
 sane by 1917 indians had responded to the call for tion expenditures which the governor in counincreased agricultural production and
 the indian cii may consider necessary for the welfare and department was making every effort to impress progress of the
 band the need for some expenupon them the importance of their work in the diture which would increase the productiveness

 all obstacles to the utilization of these duction of the blood indians the years 1916 and lands should in as
 far as possible be 1917 saw them produce the largest crop of grain removed 4 t 5 of any reserve
 in canada plus their beef produc the obvious possibilities for abuse of these tion was also the highest in canada
 17 amendments were clear for years white farmers in spite of indian efforts the government was had looked with envy
 at the uncultivated reserves not satisfied or perhaps was taking advantage and believed that the indians were wasting them of
 a wartime situation to meet its own political the farmers were anxious to put the land to bet 5 ter
 use pressure and lobby groups had worked ed upon them on feb 15 1918 this time coeron the federal government
 and in many cases cive tactics were used to try to force indian apthe politicians and officials appeared ready to
 proval of the surrender under age boys were give in now the new amendment gave the given the right to
 vote votes were bought with government almost unlimited power to lease band funds official favours were handed out to reserve
 land if the indians could not be persuad supporters and with much intimidation the sured to sell further the stipulation
 that all render was approved the head chief then filed obstacles to complete reserve utilization be push charges of fraud
 bribery and intimidation in oted aside in the name of wartime needs did not tawa and although no legal action
 was taken by leave room for special cases or even for the basic the department neither did they try to
 proceed protection of indian rights indian reserves were with the land surrender instead they began to all that was left
 for many natives and these invoke the new amendments to force the indians amendments made it legally possible for them
 to to lease vast areas of land to white farmers under lose control over them the greater production effort program
 these amendments were particularly abhorrent in some ways these and other tactics used by because in name at least the
 indians controlled the government were self defeating arthur their reserves and any band council decision had meighen announced that he
 would not allow any to be approved by the federal government now more land to be broken on the blood
 reserve by the roles were being reversed and government indians until the land deal went through this decisions concerning a
 particular land problem was done at a time when there was a call for would be passed down to the
 band council which greater production but the blood indians who would be coerced into accepting it even if they had
 the largest crops in canada in 1916 and 1917 did not agree with it a case in point occurred were
 not permitted to increase production even on the blood reserve after the amendments were though they had the land machinery
 horses passed men and capital to break new land 47 further as far as the bloods were concerned the year
 restraints were put upon the individual indians 1917 marked the end of prosperity and of a policy who opposed the
 land sale they were blacklisted of indian administration 4 the emphasis chang and their own money deposited in the agency

 for the benefit of white tng purposes farmers a proposal to sell 90 000 acres had in their willingness to
 co operate in the greater already been refused by the bloods but after the production effort the bloods did consent
 to lease 1917 amendments the same proposal was fore some 6 000 acres in march of 1918 however in 1917

 the land to olitsi lers 6 even here deception was practised for the head war economy many men worked in

 to feed their cattle while the original agreement a high degree of interest in the progress of the stipulated that
 they would 44 an appeal was war by subscribing to daily newspapers older made but again there was no government
 people who were unable to read enquired response regularly at the indian agency about the war then in the spring
 of 1918 the government the need for money to fight the war was of decided to lease to white farmers
 and ranchers paramount concern for the canadian government the 90 000 acres which it had previously tried and native support
 was strong for the patriotic to get by surrender it also preemptorily fund the red cross fund and other war
 relief dispossessed the indians who were living on that funds by 1917 19 224 26 had been donated land 45

 winter the blood cattle herd was almost wiped out and never fully recovered another only two minor problems occurred during
 the problem was the requisitioning of all blood farm war which concerned individual indians the first machinery to be used
 on the government s part involved the indians in the northern sections of of the greater production effort farm practical
 the country because the war interfered with the ly erasing any hope of individual indians plant fur trade since the
 european market disappeared ing or harvesting that year 46 interestingly with this form of income lost a substitute had wheat
 production by individual indians on the to be found it was decided to persuade in blood reserve slipped from 65
 000 bushels in habitants of these areas to return to hunting and 1917 to 5 000 bushels in 1919 the
 government would have the rnwmp regulate issues of ammunition twine and food a former indian agent rn wilson saw the

 real suffering fil indian act without anyone in the house of ed after the winter commons aware that they were
 assenting to the the second problem arose during the national ‘ scrapping of so many of canada s indian treaties
 registration because there was to some extent a feeling of mistrust as most indians did not corn in 1918 arthur
 meighen claimed that his cam prehend the purpose of the registration in the paign to increase production of food on
 indian end the registration was completed with ver y litreserves had been a great success with that year s tie
 difficulty except for remote areas in the far crop being the best in the history of the reserves north however
 agricultural production statistics on the government help for veterans the wounded reserves for that period contradict meighen s and families
 of deceased came with the soldier statement concerning wheat which was the main settlement act of 1919 in it the
 indian departcrop on reserves in the west ment was given responsibility for administering production had reached 388 731 bushels in
 all estates of deceased indian soldiers in addi 1916 but fell to 255 884 in 1918 the year when lion
 it also handled all benefits allowances and meighen claimed there was an increase pensions for the returning soldiers land also
 was in spite of government created problems in made available for indians returning to their dians were found in just
 about every aspect of reserves in a similar manner to that provided to the home front activities in the push
 for a total white veterans however the indian veterans 7 received only a certificate of possession for their receive the
 same recognition and choice of selfland not ownership as this could not be pro determination that other ethnic and racial
 groups vided on a reserve however the soldier settle were obtaining in europe ment act did override the indian act
 in permit this hope never materialized because the ting the issuance of these certificates without the canadian government still kept
 a paternalistic approval of the local band council hold over the indians and did not feel they were with the
 versailles treaty signed in 1919 yet ready to be acknowledged as equal cana world war one officially ended and the
 job of dians this attitude is best demonstrated in the rearranging the map of europe began for the amendments to
 the indian act when reserve land allies the recognition of human rights and the was leased to whites because it
 was believed they right of self determination were their main ob could do the job better than the indians even
 jectives in establishing the new national bound though farm production on the reserves had aries the idea was to match
 the social changes already increased significantly under indian which had occurred in the allied countries par control ticularly in the
 united states the hopes of the indians not only did not for a time it looked as though these social
 materialize but in fact their economic status changes would also benefit canada s indians decreased from what it had been
 before the war when hostilities finally ended they had made as a result the era of the l 920 s
 has been noted many progressive strides on their own and hoped as a time of marked decline for the indians
 that these would be carried into the coming peace economically numerically and politically the era with their active participation in
 the war feelings of many indians were summed up by a indian enlistees had been given the right to vote

 jim said ever y fort norman i had given a pipe and some tobacnow and then i had to put
 him in his place by co to a very aged indian woman named tatsy so knocking him down or get
 chewed up that i would be able to obtain character studies one day i lent wolf to a fellow who
 had us of her chewing moose hide to soften it and used him before took him on a run over
 a hun ing it to make moccasins one time i was about dred miles wolf got fooling around tripped a
 to photograph her when a pretty indian girl passbear trap and the jaws cut a deep gash in his bel
 ed tatsy suggested my taking the girl s picture ly he could have gone to the nearby indian and when
 i did not do so exclaimed with utter village for aid but he headed back home to me disgust all
 the time take pictures of old and made seventy five miles over rough river ice women you crazy before he
 died despite the beatings i was fore never the touchy kind who always wanted the ed to give him wolf

 next morning and the boy being also missing suspicion at once pointed to him as the guilty party mr purcell
 immediately made arrangements for following and overtaking the young rascal and for that purpose left here on the following thursday
 he however did not catch up to him until after he had crossed the international boundary line and was beyond
 the reach of the law purcell intent on recovering his horse followed and came up with him at o toole
 co s ranche a short distance south of the sweet grass where he found the saddle and bridle but the
 horse had got away from the lad and he had to come back without it after giving up the things
 the next morning the fellow stole them again and cached them and himself in a root house on the ranche
 this naturally incensed the cowboys on the ranche and a search was made and on being found and asked what
 he intended doing he replied that he had intended to steal another horse and ride that night the foreman of
 the ranche then told him he would have to go to benton whereupon he commenced to plead to be sent
 back to this side of the line where he would give himself up a horse from the ranche was furnished

 homes in artifacts handicrafts and cuisine this interest is often both symbolized and strengthened by visits to estonia which inevitably
 heighten awareness of estonian histor y and culture like other groups from small countries of which canadians have been only
 barely aware estonians have faced an uphill and largely unnoticed struggle for recognition as with many other immigrant groups who
 helped to settle rural alberta their contribution is not highly visible besides the estonian family names the only tangible signs
 of their presence are roadside and community plaques and rural cemeteries near the sites of early settlements in one such
 roadside cemetery near linda hall beneath rows of wrought iron crosses lie 69 estonian settlers who were members of the
 estonian evangelical luther an congregation providing mute testimony to the early estonian presence in the area but res john illak

 26 interviews among the lodges by john maclean wandering through our western towns and villages the solitary indian becomes suddenly
 aware of the obnoxiousness of his presence by the barking of dogs and the screaming of children he is compelled
 by the force of circumstances to keep a wary eye upon the stealthy cur who frowns upon the red intruder
 and warns him with significant growls that he is treading upon forbidden ground the gentler portion of society exhibits signs
 of uneasiness when first ushered into the presence of the people of the plains and the strange questions sometimes asked
 reveal the depth and genuineness of their fears the palefaced child trembles and cries in its nurse s arms when
 the painted visage of the indian is seen change the scene and these striking pecularities of the different modes of
 life of the two races are repeated going from lodge to lodge the low growls of a dozen wolfish snappish
 detestable whelps arouse all our latent energies and firmly convince us that in features least we belong to another race
 it seems impossible even after years of toil to establish any bond of sympathy between these canine parasites of the
 lodge and the white man travel through the camp unaccompanied by a dusky friend and the dogs will speedily recognize
 you as a stranger enter the lodges and the youthful occupants will flee for safety to their mother s knee
 unless oft repeated visits have made you familiar to young and old oftentimes in stormy weather have i sought the
 cheer y warmth of the lodges and sat listening to the wondrous tales of the days of yore yet never
 has my confidence been sufficient to trust to the dignity and self respect of an indian dog i have made
 friends of the children enjoyed their prattle and childlike stories but patience has fled when after bidding adieu to my
 youthful companions i have been pursued by a band of despicable lank and long haired curs lethbridge news jan 5

 wa ly taken in connection with strikes but on occa rejected owing to a lack of funds the porridge sion
 soldiers were used to avert possible trou cost only 1 6 cents per bowl ble from the unemployed an example
 of the that decision by council was seen as a step latter occurred in edmonton in june 1931 in the
 right direction but it was by no means the great depression of the intenwar years af enough unemployed delegations continued
 to fected alberta profoundly as it did the rest of confer with edmonton mayorj m douglas and canada in the
 first six months of 1931 alone premier john brownlee to seek better conditions unemployment rose from 16 9 to 21
 7 per cent although the political leaders promised help lit the capital city of edmonton had some 2 000 tle
 was done apparently because no grants were persons out of work a figure augmented daily forthcoming from the federal government
 as a by transients result the unemployed organizations in the capital decided to go on the march thus a large
 number of jobless required relief and for the governments involved that was a at this time there were three jobless
 groups in tremendous financial burden for example be edmonton the united empire loyalists the tween april 4 1930 and jan

 retaliated these expenditures concerned both levels of verbally but the episode ended without violence government no end for they represented
 a substantial drain on revenues added to that was meanwhile city council had established a the lack of assistance from
 ottawa in february special unemployment committee to study the 1931 a conference was held between the pro situation and make
 a report the recommendavincial and municipal authorities and a decision tions were tabled early in june they stated that was
 made regarding relief it was announced that the porridge kitchen should be abolished all effective april 15 next all aid
 to single men unemployed should be registered to determine would be terminated by doing that the govern who were city
 residents and all relief recipients ments hoped to stem the influx of transients and should be required to work one
 or two days a consequently lower their costs week the problem facing council now was that predictably such a move
 brought a negative the province had promised aid but only under certain conditions the government was willing m esponse from
 the unemployed on may 7 a delegation of jobless met with city council to to pay one third of the
