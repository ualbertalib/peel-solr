 5 message from the colonel of the regiment major general c b ware dso cd through the medium of the 
 activities of present day patricias with occasional flashbacks to our earlier days this edition is particularly directed not only to 
 those now serving but to those who served the regiment from 1914 through to world war 11 korea and to 
 the present the editor captain v d cole mm cd regimental adjutant with his slender staff at regimental headquarters deserve 
 more plaudits than we do or can give them for keeping the patrician alive and healthy in these days of 
 continually rising costs it is a constant struggle and i should like to pay tribute to those who produce the 
 journal and plead that all who are able may contribute in literary or financial form as they may find possible 
 this patrician contains the detail of the major happenings in regimental life during 0:dur 0:ing 1971 i shall not endeavor 
 to elaborate but should be remiss if i did not draw attention to some particular highlights all battalions contributed greatly 
 to the security of canada whether in home service continental arrangements in nato or united nations peacekeeping 0:peace 0:keeping functions 
 two regular battalions served in cyprus with great distinction the other designated for service there in 1972 the loyal edmonton 
 regiment 4 ppcli rates as highly as ever in the militia and ppcli cadet corps were strengthened and had a 
 most successful year well may we who have served in the past be proud of those who serve now they 
 do so with great credit whether abroad or in canada of interest to many will be the growing activity of 
 the regiment in the north a role first commenced in 1946 and continued through the years internationally their reputation could 
 not be higher special mention is due to third battalion in esquimalt who on return from cyprus in a november 
 ceremony received their first queen s and regimental colours from his excellency the governor general it was indeed a memorable 
 occasion which spoke magnificently for the battalion under colonel roy and for the whole regiment and it was our joy 
 to have mrs a hamilton gault the widow of our founder with us although our colonel in chief was unable 
 to be present she was certainly 0:certain 0:ly very much with us in spirit of lasting significance she gave her 
 blessing to a replica of her original wreath of laurel and charged the regimental adjutant to bring it safely to 
 canada where it shall be carried with pride on the regimental colour for all time the day following the presentation 
 a most successful annual meeting of the association was held it was presided over by our president brigadier general j 
 a delalanne cbe mc ed who was unanimously elected to serve a further term of office we all know that 
 the regiment has had a glorious past but it is to the future that we are constantly looking it has 
 been my privilege as colonel of the regiment to see many of our troops at their daily tasks throughout the 
 year the concept of service to one s country and the responsibilities and duties that this may entail is frequently 
 lacking in much of our social fabric today i can assure you however that this is not a part of 
 our regiment 0:regi 0:ment all ranks continue to serve in the spirit of our founder and those who served so 
 gallantly in the years since and in complete dedication to our colonel in chief lady patricia ramsay ci cd 
 6 the editorial staff of the patrician wishes to express its gratitude to the advertisers who help make this publication 
 possible we ask our readers to support them 
 7 editor s page most articles in our annual journal begin with the words the year 1971 has again been 
 j find it difficult to commence my page without the same set of words because the year 1971 was indeed 
 a year to be remembered 0:remember 0:ed in the annals of the regiment perhaps because of its highlight the presentation 
 of colours 1971 can be recorded as the most significant year since the 50th jubilee in 1964 it lacked only 
 one clement to make it a year that exceeded that of the jubilee this was the physical presence of the 
 coloncl in chicf it was my distinct honour to have visited lady patricia prior to the presentation and to have 
 been able to report that she was nevertheless with us in spirit and deeply regretted not being able to participate 
 in person although it was the third battalion that performed the ceremony of receiving the colours it was the regiment 
 that was on parade one had only to look through the mass of spectators and see representations of every classification 
 0:class 0:ification of patricia originals prc sccond world war second world war post second world war korea present day serving 
 members of all three battalions and from locations all across canada the third battalion performed in such a way as 
 to make all patricias proud the patrician has been subjected to a great deal of pressure as far as finances 
 are concerned this issue is the first to be affected by an increase in price since the annual journal commenced 
 publication in its present format with the 1959 60 volume the regimental executive committee regrets the necessity of this action 
 and hopes that all patricias will accept it as being necessary under the present day costs of publishing the regimental 
 newsletter has experienced no difficulty and in fact has flourished beyond all the expectations of this editor it continues to 
 be a source of great interest and to a degree great pride to me the future holds many things for 
 the regiment we have an optimistic view of continued success and good fortune two items of interest come to mind 
 at this time the second battalion proceeds to cyprus in the fall of 1972 and 1974 is the 60th diamond 
 jubilee of the regiment i would like to pay public thanks to the many patricias that have assisted me during 
 the past year from the groups of soldiers of first battalion who had the unenviable task of moving the regimental 
 museum archives and headquarters the patricias that have made me welcome at various locations in canada in england in lahr 
 and in cyprus and all stops in between the patricias in various locations that we are using as mail drops 
 for regimental news and affairs the hundreds who have contributed 0:con 0:tributed to the regimental newsletter to the many who 
 have donated money to the regiment fund and the postage account and last but not least the regimental executive for 
 the trust they have shown in my ability to conduct 0:con 0:duct the regimental affairs each and everyone of them 
 has assisted in no small way to making the tasks of the regimental adjutant interesting enjoyable 0:en 0:joyable and a 
 continual source of personal satisfaction i again remind all persons concerned that copy for the patrician 1972 must be received 
 at regimental headquarters no later than the 31st of january 1973

 11 ghana possibly the final report by major m c stewart cd ghana again this article was requested by the 
 editor he pointed out that no information 0:inform 0:ation on ghana had been published since the reports by majors goodman 
 and hunt in the 1962 and 1963 issues of the patrician considering the numbers of patricias who have served with 
 the canadian armed forces training ghana cafttg an article in this issue was considered appropriate to bring readers up to 
 date scope included are the following aspects of a ghanaian tour team functions patricia representation the country and climate the 
 people and armed forces life in ghana with cafttg the author s job there the effects of our involvement and 
 the future of the team the many political economic and social changes in ghana over the last decade are excluded 
 it suffices to note that these changes had a significant impact on the organization and function of cafttg what follows 
 is a personal impression it is highly unlikely that other former members of cafttg will agree with all of the 
 views expressed in this article cafttg the training team was despatched in 1961 at ghana s request to partially 0:parti 
 0:ally compensate for the abrupt departure of british officers in the ghanaian army initially the team strength was 20 and 
 all three former services were represented members were employed in educational training or staff jobs at garrisons and training schools 
 in accra kumasi and takoradi the agreement for a maximum of eight years was to be reviewed annually in consonance 
 with canadian assistance a sizable british team was invited back in the mid sixties at ghana s request canada has 
 extended the agreement every year since 1966 because of the annual review aimed at providing canadian expertise 0:ex 0:pertise where 
 required and concurrently to ghanaianize as many positions as possible the team composition has changed over the years the present 
 strength of cafttg is 12 predominantly officers of the rank of major all of these excluding the medical officer are 
 employed on staff or instructional 0:in 0:structional duties at the military academy and training school mats the ministry of defence 
 or at army headquarters in accra the senior canadian officer with cafttg a colonel is team commander and advisor 0:ad 
 0:visor to the canadian high commissioner he and two senior ncos are on the strength of and work from the 
 high commission patricias with cafttg since 1961 the following former and serving patricias have served with cafttg with apologies to

 70 in addition to the above the colonel of the regiment major general c b ware dso cd is familiar 
 with ghana as a result of his visit there in the latter days of the nkrumah regime when he was 
 commandant of the national defence college the country ghana is 92 000 square miles in area roughly three times the 
 size of new brunswick and approximately the same area as west germany or the state of oregon it can be 
 physically divided into three general areas firstly there is a grassy coastal plain with good beaches and surf a long 
 history of contacts with europeans has resulted in a great number of unique forts and castles built from the fifteenth 
 to the eighteenth century for the protection of the gold and slave trades some of the forts are in ruins 
 but many are being preserved and restored or are still in use the castle at elmina near cape coast for 
 example built by the portuguese in 1482 is used as a police training centre the second area inland from the 
 coast and taking up roughly half the country is the interior rain forest it is characterized by thick jungle rugged 
 escarpments and high hills a huge lake over 3 200 square miles in area has been created in this region 
 by the building of the dam on the volta river 
 13 the third area is the vast expanse cf savannah and grassland in the northern region of the country this 
 sparsely populated partly muslim north has a character and culture remarkably different from the south accra the capital where most 
 of the training team were located is the biggest city in ghana with a population of about 500 000 on 
 the site of the former british dutch and danish coastal settlements of jamestown 0:james 0:town usshertown and christiansborg it is 
 a curious blend of monumental white elephants built during nkrumah s days new commercial buildings centuries old forts and markets 
 and teeming humanity one never quite got over the incongruity of encountering open sewers within 20 yards of a modern 
 department store some of the team worked in kumasi the second largest city 150 miles north of accra an attractive 
 place located on hilly ground in the forest area it is the capital of the ashanti the proud warrior tribe 
 with whom the british fought a series of wars one of the results of early colonial claims and conflicts is 
 that frenchspeaking 0:french 0:speaking countries surround ghana with ivory coast to the west upper volta to the north and togo 
 to the east the climate ghana is officially described as being dry tropical climatic region with a hot dry and 
 parched period from november to may the remainder of the year is hot and wet and there are small rains 
 and naturally big rains although the season only lasts for about six weeks it rains big virtually every day water 
 comes down in torrential sheets severely limiting activity during most of the year the humidity is high and there are 
 many uncomfortable days some relief on the coast is provided by the trade winds from the sea the climate is 
 therefore monotonous and at times trying and one frequently experienced the desire for some fresh invigorating air this type of 
 climate features exposure to an astonishing variety of reptile and insect life geckles small lizards mice rats and snakes abound 
 flies termites mosquitoes and other species of insects are annoyingly present 0:pres 0:ent at all times especially at night most 
 canadians had cats and dogs to keep the reptiles away but more than one family had interesting experiences with snakes 
 the mosquitoes are smaller than the canadian variety but more prevalent accounting for the high incidence of yellow fever and 
 malaria in that part of africa because of these diseases ghana until quite recently was regarded as the white man 
 s grave and it is recorded that the fatality rate among europeans in the early days was anywhere from 25 
 to 50 per cent this is one of the reasons why europeans tended to stay in the forts on the 
 coast and significant penetrations inland were net made until the ashanti wars late in the last century this fatality rate 
 also explains why there was no permanent colonial settlement in west africa as occurred in other parts of the continent 
 if they came at all europeans came to trade govern or garrison and until recent times few remained for long 
 the people the population of ghana is approximately 8 000 000 a decision by 
 14 the ghanaian government in 1970 reduced this population substantially all aliens or non ghanaians who did not have a 
 residence permit were expelled most of these were africans from neighboring countries but significant numbers of lebanese and asians were 
 also involved the result was some rather pathetic sights as families many of them born in ghana were forced to 
 leave in haste carrying their possessions another effect was that key areas in the trading and serving sector broke down 
 as some functions had traditionally been carried out by non ghanaians there are many ghanaian tribes and their distribution is 
 fairly definable 0:defin 0:able geographically the largest tribes are the ewe in the volta region the ga around accra the 
 fanti on the coast further west the ashanti and related tribes in the forest and in the north the brong 
 dagomba and mushi with the development of commerce and industry and the spread of education there is increasing movement to 
 the cities especially of young people thus the cities are overcrowded and unemployment is high averaging 0:aver 0:aging 30 per 
 cent in accra alone in spite of an increasingly mobile population and centralization of government tribal loyalties affiliations and influences 
 are strong and many of the kings and chiefs continue to wield a great deal of power ghanaians are proud 
 of their respective tribes and individuals were continually referring to their tribe family village etc as a source of strength 
 and relevance these tribal loyalities do make it difficult however for many of them to think of ghana as a 
 country and to develop national aspirations and institutions 0:institu 0:tions in this respect their tribal and regional differences are not 
 too different from those in canada at least the ghanaian tribal loyalties provide stability and a sense of belonging as 
 the old ways clash with western culture visit to the defence college by general gowan right president of nigeria and 
 brigadier afrifa chairman ghana presidential commission accompanied by major mc stewart 
 15 there are virtually dozens of separate languages and dialects however three are understood in most parts of the country 
 ewe in the east twi in the south and central areas and hausa in the north english is the language 
 of commerce and government and most ghanaian children take it in school the ghanaians are a happy intelligent fairly industrious 
 considering the climate and friendly people with whom it was pleasurable and meaningful 0:mean 0:ingful to associate they have a 
 marvelous sense of humour and considering the general level of education have made commendable efforts to develop their country since 
 independence in 1957 the armed forces the strength of the ghanaian armed forces is approximately 28 000 important roles are 
 internal security assistance in the development of the country and the defence of ghana the army with a strength of 
 about 15 000 is the largest service it includes two infantry brigade groups an armoured reconnaissance regiment 0:regi 0:ment including 
 a squadron of horsed cavalry a mortar regiment an engineer regiment a parachute battalion two training schools and some support 
 and administrative units the 8000 man air force has a number of training and transport aircraft 0:air 0:craft including canadian 
 caribou and buffalo and a few very expensive for ghana italian macci jet fighters the air force supports the army 
 and is also engaged in mapping the country the primary role of the 5000 man navy is countering smuggling which 
 is a lucrative business in west africa the forces had a number of problems which made their roles and subsequently 
 ours rather difficult because of the sudden departure of british officers in 1961 ghanaians were rapidly promoted there was thus 
 a lack of experienced officers of the rank of colonel and above this was compounded by the necessity to second 
 officers to government agencies after the coup to assist the police in running the country consequently many command and staff 
 jobs in the army were held by comparatively junior and inexperienced personnel another problem was the extensive mix of weapons 
 and equipment ill advisedly bought from both east and west in the first few years after independence purchases were often 
 made without a complementary order of spare parts and consideration of the need for trained technical personnel in addition bugetary 
 limitations precluded the purchase of new equipment or spare parts the result was a mixed bag of equipment difficult to 
 maintain 0:main 0:tain and which limited efficiency examples of army equipment are as follows 0:fol 0:lows british vehicles israeli mortars 
 british and russian small arms and canadian anti tank weapons some interesting situations were encountered great fun was experienced by 
 our rceme expert in trying to advise the ghanaians on how to keep their eight different kinds of staff cars 
 on the road the team ordnance ammunition expert spent the greater part of a hazardous year blowing up tons of 
 condemned russian ammunition the navy was constantly under fire for lack of effectiveness in combatting smuggling 0:smug 0:gling this it 
 is suggested would be a difficult role for any navy primarily equipped with anti submarine vessels 
 16 yes we have no bananas a problem for ghanaian commanders was the lack of opportunity for field training a 
 limitation imposed by scarcity cf training funds and the ever present threat of internal security operations the officers with whom 
 we met and associated were on the whole keen and eager to learn the majority were from the southern part 
 of the country with a longer and more likely exposure to education the other ranks mainly from the warrior tribes 
 of the north were well disciplined trained and enthusiastic however since recruiting had been restricted for some time the average 
 age of the private soldier was 25 well above a desirable 0:de 0:sirable age in short the rank and file 
 were getting old and undoubtedly a bit stale ncos with 15 to 20 years service in the same battlion and 
 company 0:com 0:pany were not uncommon interestingly enough most army units were overstrength 0:over 0:strength as they appeared reluctant to 
 release a man even when medically unfit soldiering in ghana is an honourable and desirable profession attested to by the 
 establishment strength and enthusiasm of army units and firmly founded on tribal custom and the great tradition of the west 
 african division in east africa and burma in world war 11 life in ghana with cafttg some aspects of life 
 in ghana which made the tour pleasant or unpleasant 0:un 0:pleasant might be of interest 
 17 the working day was from 0730 hrs to 1330 hrs six days a week with a short mid morning 
 break it may not seem like a long day but in actual fact some days were long indeed depending on 
 the heat and humidity nevertheless there was still a considerable amount of spare time and the wise team member and 
 his family took up some sort of purposeful activity excellent surfing and swimming in the ocean were available and there 
 was a good swimming pool nearby in addition the team rented a beach area from the chief of a fishing 
 village about 20 miles from accra and sunday excursions were popular the undertow was dangerous however and great care had 
 to be taken especially with children the ghanaians regarded 0:re 0:garded our antics at the beach with hilarity as anyone 
 venturing into the sea was in their view either a fisherman or a fool golf tennis and riding were also 
 available and there were many interesting visits one could make in the accra area and along the coast housing was 
 adequate and team members were provided like all officers in the ghanaian forces with a furnished bungalow a civilian batman 
 0:bat 0:man paid a minimal wage by the army was also provided most members supplemented this wage so the batman 
 could carry out other tasks and hired another servant as well many had cooks or nannies if they had small 
 children servants lived in quarters provided at the bungalow and were absolutely necessary if one was to do his job 
 and if the house was to remain habitable servants however could be a problem and often were shopping was a 
 trial especially on steamy days if the stores were crowded virtually anything was available in accra if one was prepared 
 to pay enough and knew where to look one soon learned to buy on first seeing the required item if 
 one delayed and returned later it would often be finished 0:fin 0:ished and remain so for weeks imported canned goods 
 were expensive and the local beef was as tough as shoe leather to supplement local purchases 0:pur 0:chases the team 
 imported meat from kenya and mls goods from canada and operated a small canteen for beer liquor and cigarettes also 
 until it closed down in 1969 the british naafi was available for cafttg a fascinating part of the tour was 
 the constant exposure to a totally different culture and set of values the music drumming and dancing extended 0:ex 0:tended 
 family system the widespread belief in witchcraft and assorted mythical beings the tribal modes of dress and behavior were completely 
 foreign to our own these customs and values could be appreciated if one examined them in detail made an effort 
 to make ghanaian friends and expressed interest in the country the result would often be a rare invitation to some 
 of the more interesting tribal ceremonies if one did none of these things there was a tendency to be critical 
 of ghanaians simply because they didn t compare favourably with our culture and way of doing things in the final 
 analysis there is no reason why they should the social life was extensive and one could easily become overcommitted 0:over 
 0:committed the officers mess at mats was not as active as our messes in canada since most ghanaian officers could 
 not afford significant mess expenses there was however a movie once a week and the ghanaian equivalent 0:equiva 0:lent of 
 poits every saturday noon the latter usually featured beer in quart bottles who can forget star and club ground nuts 
 red hot kabobs all usually to the accompaniament of a soul band playing so 
 18 loud that normal conversation was impossible there were also usually two mixed parties a year and the occasional mess 
 dinner the canadians regularly 0:regu 0:larly held house parties for the team the british and the ghanaians one soon learned 
 that the form for the latter was a large cocktail party with lots of beer and brandy or a stand 
 up buffet with curry if one was to achieve a turn out small dinner parties for ghanaians were a disaster 
 as they didn t attach much importance to appearing or in fact in replying to an invitation the pay and 
 leave benefits were generous in addition to the normal canadian rates of pay one was paid the normal ghanaian rate 
 240 a month for a major we were allowed to import items duty free for the first year of the 
 tour this meant that one could sell one s car on departure and essentially break even on the deal after 
 driving it for two years there were two weeks local leave granted annually and two months leave in midtour 0:mid 
 0:tour which had to be taken in a temperate climate return air fare for team members and their families from 
 ghana to canada or the equivalent was provided some did come back to canada while the more adventuresome 0:adventure 0:some 
 took advantage of a wonderful opportunity and toured elsewhere in the world health was a worry especially if one had 
 children although we had a team medical officer the medical practices left a great deal to be desired by our 
 standards everyone took paludrine daily to ward off malaria nevertheless it was not a healthy climate and one frequently felt 
 ghastly for no apparent reason christmas 1969 santa claus major john bishop arrives at the team beach 
 19 defence college course number 7 september to december 1969 a matter of constant frustration was the extraordinary length of 
 time it took to get even the simplest tasks accomplished difficulties and delays were always encountered with baggage cars finances 
 etc on entering or leaving the country such tasks as getting one s car serviced or repairs done to the 
 house or dealing with any government or public agency were usually characterized by vagueness and delays maybe next tomorrow in 
 the end one had to make it happen or resort to dash the exorbitant system of tipping in cash or 
 kind peculiar to west africa defence college the author served as a directing staff ds at the defence college for 
 the first year and as ds coord or co since the ghanaian co s establishment position was never filled for 
 the second year of the tour the defence college was founded in 1964 to train staff officers at the gso3 
 level for the ghanaian forces over the years a somewhat higher level was developed gso3v2 since most graduates of the 
 course were posted to g 2 positions anyway the staff course was of 4 months duration with 24 students in 
 two syndicates for four tutorial periods it was as practical as possible relevant to ghanaian requirements and the top six 
 students on each course could expect to be selected for attendance at a foreign staff college in 1968 there were 
 three canadian and one british ds the following year because of the departure of the latter coupled with increasing commitments 
 0:com 0:mitments we succeeded in getting three ghanaians who had been trained at a foreign staff college posted in this 
 move had obviously been desirable for some time 
 20 in addition to the staff course the defence college also set and marked the majority of the written officer 
 promotion examinations and up to 1969 conducted the practical examinations as well the practice followed for the latter was tedious 
 since there was reluctance to concentrate all candidates in the accra area there were two exam centres one in the 
 north and the other in the south the procedure was to conduct one set on the ground near accra and 
 then fly 300 miles north to tamali and conduct the same tests several days later on ground only remotely similar 
 to that in the south needless to say the northern candidates always seemed to have better results fortunately we succeeded 
 in convincing the army commander 0:com 0:mander in 1970 that one exam centre was appropriate effects of cafttg considering the 
 small size of cafttg it should be recognized that the beneficial effects of the canadian forces contribution to the training 
 and education of the ghana army has been quite significant it must be remembered 0:re 0:membered that ghanaian officers have 
 had an important role in the governing 0:govern 0:ing administration and development of the country since independence the influence of 
 cafttg has therefore been felt up to the highest level in the view of many cafttg is an example of 
 the kind of foreign aid we should be providing i e experienced personnel trained in particular skills rather than financial 
 or material grants readers will be interested to know that the regiment is well known in ghana many of the 
 junior officers and other ranks of the early days are now the majors and senior ncos in the ghana army 
 one was always being approached by officers and men who recognizing the hat badge would enquire about hunt ardelian dallison 
 etc major al bull seemed to be best remembered for his cigars rye and sojourns into the aburi hills another 
 effect has been the offers of vacancies to ghana for canadian military courses their officers regularly attend the staff school 
 in toronto and the staff college in kingston and technical officers are frequently attached to canadian units for training two 
 worthwhile projects in ghana were initiated by members of cafttg in 1970 training command funded and built a school and 
 teachers residence in the volta region last year captain don denison a former patricia initiated project pipeline a plan to 
 pipe water to the village of mpcseduadze near cape coast he raised 2 700 himself carried out a march of 
 75 miles from accra to the village on the miles for millions principle to raise additional funds and convinced the 
 canadian forces to target for donations of 25 000 to complete the project captain denison helped the same village to 
 build a school on his tour with cafttg in 1964 in recognition of his helpfulness to the people of ghana 
 patricias should be aware that a school in accra has been named the donald international school and the people of 
 mpcseduadze have made him an honourary chief future of cafttg at the time of writing it is understood that none 
 of the cafttg personnel are to be replaced in the future and that the last team member is to be

 23 first battalion the first battalion ended the year 1971 as it began it in sub zero weather practising its 
 skill at winter warfare in the interval we achieved a memorable year which included a tour in cyprus the re 
 activation of a fourth rifle company a change of command and another reorganization all in all last year s prediction 
 that this year would be a year of frenetic activity has been more than borne out unfortunately due to so 
 much activity 0:act 0:ivity we were unable to carry out some of those special events on which the battalion has 
 set such store in the past such as trooping the colour and the french grey cup on the other hand 
 we were able to conduct a highly successful canada day in cyprus an opportunity which may never come again the 
 battalion has had a good year has done a lot learned a lot and anticipates an equally interesting 1972 exercise 
 northern guard northern guard was a combination of a battalion winter concentration 0:con 0:centration and a 1 combat group directed 
 exercise held in dundurn saskatchewan from 11 29 january 1971 dundurn is another wainwright a mixture of rolling parkland and 
 moonscape it can also be bitterly cold there were few days when the temperature rose above of and the average 
 0:aver 0:age was about 20 f good training weather we said but some mornings it seemed just a bit too 
 good in addition to company training the battalion conducted live firing exercises at platoon and section level the latter was 
 a competition and was won by pte mclean and his section from a company a fine achievement when one considers 
 the experience of some of the other commanders the unit had under command for the period b company of 2 
 ppcli a composite service company from 1 service battalion g battery 3 rcha a detachment of ch 113 s and 
 a reconnaissance troop from ldsh rc 0:ldsh 0:rc b company acted as enemy on both battalion exercises and as usual 
 with exercise enemies fought tenaciously appeared to be bullet and shell proof but in the end were inexplicably unable to 
 revive themselves after what proved to be the last battalion attack for these exercises c company was mechanized while a 
 and b were frequently heli borne this enabled the unit to move rapidly and reduce the number of old style 
 two kilometres per hour snowshoe marches although there were some of these as well northern guard was a good testing 
 period for the unit and for our new soldiers especially the down homers learned they could cope with the extremes 
 of temperature found on the great plains and their confidence in themselves and their unit was measurably increased a better 
 start for a tour in cyprus could hardly have been found a feature of the exercise was the visit of 
 dr steven worobetz mc md lieutenant governor of saskatchewan and medical officer with the regiment in italy in 1943 44 
 dr worobetz arrived on a typically cold day to be welcomed by an honour guard from b company he toured 
 the battalion 0:battal 0:ion by apc and helicopter and the cold didn t dampen his enthusiasm one bit

 25 cyprus the battalion s tour in the island of sun sand and was an interesting if quiet one while 
 the political situation undoubtedly deteriorated especially 0:especi 0:ally toward the end there were few significant overt actions by either side 
 which caused more than momentary interest the three incidents which caused the most stir in the unit the confrontation at 
 rocky s corner the sentry box war and the establishment of chimo op while they may be considered as non 
 battle honours for b and a companies respectively 0:respective 0:ly they are unlikely to ever be considered among the highlights 
 of regimental history by and large it s fair to say that we did the job efficiently kept our cool 
 and used our leisure time to good advantage aside from our considerable ability to make personal contact between our vehicles 
 and those of the local populace we had relatively few domestic problems the unit went in heavily for sports at 
 which it was moderately successful but our main achievement group as opposed to individual appeared to be conducted tours for 
 the fourth estate the gentlemen of the press descended on us with monotonous regularity we responded by dragging 0:drag 0:ging 
 them from their soft beds in the ledra palace hotel briefing them on the situation the threat and so on 
 forcing them to climb to the top of flour mill or oil factory op s dodge traffic on hermes street 
 and breathe deeply when passing through city company in turn they wrote articles of depressing similarity about us one reporter 
 did make an attempt to repay our generosity he addressed an article to the girls of calgary telling them of 
 the beaches the sun and of the hundreds of clean cut fun loving young canadians waiting for them if they 
 had the price of an air fare to nicosia to the best of our knowledge the girls of calgary remained 
 unimpressed 0:unim 0:pressed although several wives wrote scathing letters to their husbands a major feature of our tour seemed to 
 be repairing the accommodation so generously provided by the un the pioneers were in their glory striding all over nicosia 
 with lengths of lumber pipes fuse boxes etc in their hands and purposeful looks in their eyes the companies especially 
 city found that they had to devote a considerable amount of time and effort just to keep a roof over 
 their heads this probably wasn t a totally bad thing as it did assist in relieving boredom and who knows 
 we may have launched some master builder or interior decorator on his future career the sub units became somewhat introverted 
 due to their physical separation from each other and the headquarters and took on distinct personalities 0:per 0:sonalities the a 
 company suburbanites b company slum dwellers support company can doers and headquarters company jockstraps were each convinced that they were 
 doing all the work and that everyone else was merely on holiday this argument is still going on with no 
 sign of a solution one of the features of the tour was our national presentation on 1 july each contingent 
 in unficyp is required to hold a combination open house and propaganda session once during its tour at which it 
 extols the virtues of its native land and feeds the visitors national dishes we decided to hold a stampede as 
 it seemed most appropriate and as most personnel had qualified for their un medals a medals parade the stampede featured 
 a real western breakfast rodeo events modified to use animals locally available i e greased pigs in lieu of steers 
 and singing square dancing

 medals and march pasts after 1 july when all duties had become a matter of routine the main interest in

 first post cyprus exercise was an unqualified success four days of sub unit training and competitions were followed by a 
 battalion exercise 0:ex 0:ercise emphasizing defence and movement in heavily forested mountain terrain the patrol competition in which all twelve 
 rifle platoons participated 0:participat 0:ed was won in convincing fashion by 12 platoon with a 90 score in the deadfall 
 littered forest with the temperature averaging 20 only those patrols which had been carefully prepared and trained had any hope 
 of success this was perhaps the most valuable lesson learned or re learned by the subalterns and w os who 
 led the various platoons the battalion exercise with c company as enemy and a company of the calgary highlanders 0:high 
 0:landers included in the friendly orbat brought home clearly the dangers and opportunities of fighting in this type of country 
 ambush counterambush 0:counter 0:ambush searching for flanks and weak spots and waiting for the cold to diminish alertness were the 
 order of the day the enemy were determined to win and at any cost in human life one of their 
 platoons was wiped out or in their words liquidated so many times that they were referred to as cunningham s 
 cannon fodder of course they didn t win although they came within fifteen minutes of doing so at one point 
 this type of more or less free play on the exercise 0:exer 0:cise was both stimulating and exciting both at 
 the cps and at the sharp end this is confirmed by the fact that the exercise was even discussed later 
 in the junior ranks club an almost unprecedented event it was agreed that while the roving had been considerable the 
 rotating for once had been kept to a minimum sports the battalion was more than normally active in sports both 
 at the inter company level and in the production of representative teams during 1971 in part this was due to 
 the large number of sporting events held by unficyp most of which we entered in all fifteen representative teams took 
 the field to compete in ten different sports in both calgary and cyprus in these sports we won four team 
 championships and had a substantial number of individual champions in february the volleyball team won the base championship by defeating 
 0:defeat 0:ing all comers in a round robin tournament they received their toughest competition from the regimental band who very 
 nearly pulled off what we 
 29 at least would have considered an upset the basketball team won the unficyp title in july with an undefeated 
 record they proved far too strong for their opponents in both technique and experience and were never seriously challenged individual 
 winners included pte stretch mcnally unficyp basketball 0:basket 0:ball scoring champion cpl terry clarke winner of the 200 metre medley 
 in the unficyp swim meet pte richard cardinal cpls john stack and les jackson and capt mag housken champions in 
 the three mile shot put and discus javelin and high jump respectively at the 1 combat group meet and lt 
 garry manchester and maj garry hunt 800 and 200 metre champions of unficyp a very active inter company sports programme 
 was conducted in cyprus the programme had three main purposes to provide recreation to serve as a breeding ground for 
 unit representative teams and to stimulate sub unit esprit games were normally played on two or three afternoons or evenings 
 per week and there were usually at least two sports on the go at any one time the only major 
 sport not conducted was flag football and thus there was no french grey cup this year one of the best 
 features of the programme was the number of promising newcomers to the battalion who showed well in the inter company 
 events and then went on to ease out some of the old hands from their positions on battalion teams this 
 was especially the case in basketball track and softball a company won the inter company aggregate championship in a close 
 struggle with hq company the issue was in doubt right up to the last sport on the programme and a 
 company were worthy winners who consistently fielded determined and enthusiastic teams promotions the following members of the battalion are congratulated

 got off to a good start when pte keith mclean commanding 0:com 0:manding 2c won the section in defence competition 
 on exercise northern 0:north 0:ern guard good shooting and good leadership combined to give us the victory over thirty four 
 other sections a well deserved promotion to corporal followed shortly northern guard was hard work but by the end a 
 company was a well trained and cold proof sub unit february and march were spent preparing for and moving to 
 cyprus by i april we were at full strength in our location in northwest nicosia and with a new name 
 suburb company we probably had the best area of any sub unit good living quarters some of them private homes 
 abandoned in the earlier fighting some high and breezy ops and of course our own free bicycles the platoons rotated 
 through the various areas and ops officially to maintain interest and enthusiasm but actually to give everyone a chance to 
 climb op flour mill and view the country side and other interesting local scenes suburb company won the inter company 
 aggregate sports championship 0:champion 0:ship while in cyprus some of the athletes who contributed most to our victory were pte 
 mcnally cpls hansen leblanc and wark sgt hurford and lt manchester the rest of the company made their contribution to 
 victory by doing extra duty when the athletes were away pte glenn arnold received a commanding officer s commendation for 
 his action in saving the life of a cypriot national guardsman on 7 may the guardsman who was on sentry 
 duty had collapsed and pte arnold on investigating found that he was not breathing and had swallowed his tongue pte 
 arnold applied mouth to mouth resuscitation and when this failed conventional artificial respiration the latter proved successful and once the 
 soldier began breathing regularily pte arnold arranged for him to be taken to hospital his prompt action was in the 
 best traditions of the canadian professional soldier tt wasn t all work in cyprus and off duty hours at the 
 beaches in town or at the koti bar were thoroughly enjoyed by all the company had an almost proprietorial interest 
 in the koti as our bar as well we should have we put enough money into it to bankroll the 
 economy of all nicosia for the canada day celebrations in addtion to providing number one guard we also supplied the 
 roving cree pte apache head and that well known bronc rider and goat fighter lt dan davies the pig catchers 
 led by capt marcel bcztilny won their event in record time and were suitably rewarded

 32 besides making good use of the 14 day leave period during the cyprus tour some of our members showed 
 considerable imagination in the destinations 0:destina 0:tions they chose for their annual and disembarkation leave pte gordon burnell for example 
 worked his way over to hawaii on a steamer for an extended holiday in the sun on our return we 
 went from the sublime to the ridiculous that is back to winter training the bow river forest and exercise rotating 
 rover we had a busy time on the exercise being first employed as the screen and then making two swift 
 moves to block and ambush the enemy as they attempted to outflank the battalion b company b company began the 
 year by learning some good lessons on exercise northern guard not the least of these was that under no circumstances 
 0:circum 0:stances should the company apc be loaned to c company who seemed to think it was meant to be 
 used as a submarine in cyprus we became city company a name both desceptive and evocative our area of responsibility 
 lay in the old city in a rabbit warren of narrow twisting streets lined with ruined or semi ruined houses 
 which are almost all still occupied the constant roar of human and vehicle traffic at maple leaf manor where one 
 third of the company was quartered was just one of the inconveniences we had to get used to at both 
 our living areas the manor and beaver lodge we found the buildings in a very dilapidated state in addtion we 
 depended upon two different water supply systems three different electrical hook ups and no sewers when it rained everything leaked 
 sumps backed up and electricity failed in between bouts of outpost duty everyone pitched in repairing painting wiring and scrubbing 
 0:scrub 0:bing to make the quarters as habitable as possible of course it wasn t all bad we were strategically 
 placed for trips to regina street the entertainment mecca of the island there were daily swim trips and we all 
 had our two weeks leave the nightly movie played to a full house including at maple leaf manor the greek 
 and turkish cypriot soldiers on adjoining roof tops failure to show a movie was regarded by them as a diplomatic 
 crisis our special contribution to the canada day celebrations were the square dancers capt don hill lt harry elliott cpls 
 brian gee and greg rushworth and their ladies and we mustn t forget the organizer and ring master of the 
 rodeo events and sometime squire of maple leaf manor capt bill bewick on return from cyprus the company completed its 
 annual and disembarkation 0:disem 0:barkation leave and then started in to relearn its winter skills in preparation for exercise rotating 
 rover this preparation included skiing where under the eye of captain peter chamberlin our british exchange officer we learned the 
 snow plough and the spread eagle fall although initially we didn t get too much of the action on rotating

 34 september saw two armour defence detachments under cpl j r d proulx off to exercise running jump in gagetown 
 major john hunter also attended this exercise as an umpire finally in october we handled the return of the battalion 
 from cyprus this was largely a repeat of their departure as far as we were concerned this was followed by 
 the staff inspection and in early november the commander s inspection these two events coming at the time they did 
 received somewhat less attention than usual but that can be corrected next year on exercise rotating rover we were able 
 to give free rein to our imagination in playing the role of enemy this was supposed to be in practice 
 for exercise rapier thrust but we decided to show the unit a thing or two for twenty four hours we 
 had the battalion at our mercy or we would have if we could have got at them however we had 
 some navigation problems comrades scott and gagne were purged for this and some geneva convention problems when the brutal and 
 sadistic enemy assaulted 0:as 0:saulted comrades barnes and martin in spite of these difficulties our enthusiasm 0:en 0:thusiasm and tactical 
 skill nearly carried us to victory unfortunately we always seemed to be a few minutes too late at the critical 
 point even our attempt to eliminate the echelon failed in the end this final disaster so disappointed our leader that 
 he fell on his sword there is no truth to the rumour that he tripped over it d company after 
 a hibernation of five years the french grey company has returned to the battalion establishment the new d company was 
 formed in august and is constituted mainly from new soldiers recently arrived from the pay level 3 training at the 
 combat arms school and officers and ncos newly posted in or transferred from other companies rookies or not d company 
 has already shown its mettle by taking the three top places in the battalion patrol competition during exercise rotating rover 
 lt harry elliott and 12 platoon carried off the top honour with 10 and i 1 platoons second and third 
 respectively to quote the bearded gentleman who umpired the competition they may be running a concentration camp but it works 
 support company anyone coming back to support company after a year s absence would be struck by the many changes 
 which have taken place the company 0:com 0:pany first split into two sections prior to cyprus with the bulk of 
 the company 0:com 0:pany administrators technicians and pioneer platoon going to cyprus leaving behind a small administrative team and some 
 weapon detachments then on the return of the battalion from cyprus the signals reconnaissance 0:reconnais 0:sance and weapons platoons were 
 assigned to the newly created headquarters 0:head 0:quarters company and support company became entirely concerned with logistic support the company 
 went through three different commanders and seconds in command during the year but fortunately retained csm h a johnston to 
 teach them the ropes

 36 c company c company filled with keen though green recruits attacked its first major exercise northern guard with enthusiasm 
 but also betrayed some confusion as to the aim of the exercise while most of the battalion thought the aim 
 of northern guard was to become proficient in winter warfare c company apparently felt that it was to test the 
 apc as a machine for carrying out underwater diving not even the operations officer could buy that one however mounted 
 in our faithful carriers we carried out our part in the exercise by swooping across the barren saskatchewan 0:saskatche 0:wan 
 prairie driving the enemy from one position to another and keeping well clear of streams the exercise over the company 
 settled down to absorbing those personnel not going to cyprus and to assisting those who were to get off to 
 a flying start we did all the dull routine jobs such as loading baggage and stores running the sausage machine 
 and taking over the stores and equipment so that the unit could depart in style when they were gone we 
 breathed a premature sigh of relief premature because the bulk of the real work and most of the problems still 
 lay ahead as the backbone of the rear party not only were we responsible for training ourselves in preparation for 
 and participating in waincon 71 but we also did all the housekeeping 0:housekeep 0:ing literally for the battalion there is 
 no way to list or mention all those who worked long and hard to keep everything running smoothly as usual 
 a big job that had to be done brought out the best in everyone and all ranks did themselves proud 
 one of the early and more memorable incidents affecting rear party was arranging the flights for wives who wished to 
 visit their husbands in cyprus this was something different for the welfare officer and assistant adjutant to get stuck in 
 to and they did a very good job in all over eighty wives took advantage of these flights and only 
 a few encountered any problems we also at very short notice provided saddles stetsons and other paraphernalia for the unit 
 s canada day in cyprus sgt p c j couronne and the transport section were kept busy throughout the spring 
 looking after the unit s vehicles preparing them for loan to other units all over the west and then fixyig 
 them up again when they came rattling back at the same time they rang up three consecutive months of accident 
 free driving a fine record in june the company group went off to waincon and milcon we exercised under the 
 command of 2 ppcli for waincon and were responsible for assisting the militia on milcon and also for conducting the 
 junior and senior tactics courses in august we were called out twice to search for missing persons one was for 
 a boy lost in the bragg creek area and the other a man possibly drowned in the bow river near 
 sarcee d m elliott led our search parties on both occasions and in the first case two days were spent 
 searching before 0:be 0:fore the boy was found in the second case the victim after overturning his raft walked home 
 and went to bed some time later he decided to let the searchers know that he was alright during august 
 we also began vehicle painting and wireless installation programmes to prepare the unit vehicles prior to the return of the 
 battalion from cyprus

 38 the first battalion exercise of 1971 northern guard found the company very short handed in the headquarters and qm 
 sections and it was fortunate that the unit and combat group exercises were of relatively short duration even so the 
 distances covered by the helicopter and apc borne companies was considerable and an al echelon was used to replenish them 
 as we had no tracked vehicles this meant slogging deuce and a halfs through the snow drifts of dundurn the 
 mrts were also kept very busy with long range recovery problems which they solved with their usual devotion 0:de 0:votion 
 many of these recoveries had to be carried out hours after the exercise 0:exer 0:cise had ended when everyone else 
 was in camp and resting the company commander oc pioneer platoon and csm laid out an elaborate defence for the 
 echelon which obviously frightened the enemy by its mere existence as they never came near it as the last group 
 out of dundurn at the ghastly hour of 0500 the company headquarters had the satisfaction of leaving some snow on 
 the barracks floor which the combat group staff officers had to mop up before they could turn over the camp 
 in cyprus the company formed the basis of cancon base the administrative element of the canadian contingent added to our 
 own pioneers drivers clerks maintenance and qm personnel were engineers cooks pay postal dental and air movements experts these latter 
 were known as augmentation personnel but everyone in cancon base whether originally unit or augmentation worked wholeheartedly toward the common 
 goal to ensure that all administrative requirements of the contingent 0:con 0:tingent were satisfied as you will perhaps have noted 
 in the rifle company accounts these requirements were many and varied and nothing other than immediate and effective action was 
 ever considered sufficient either by us or them the life of the company was centred in our own area blue 
 beret camp five miles from downtown nicosia and about a mile from nicosia international airport we found that with ingenuity 
 and hard work blue beret camp could be made to provide both recreation and relaxation for recreation we cleaned up 
 and operated the camp swimming pool which had been lying derelict for over a year and built our own ball 
 diamond the latter was by far the best field in the unit arid a symbol of the fine group spirit 
 of the company for relaxation we built a patio at the junior ranks club at first this was just to 
 be a place to sit while watching the movie but it seemed to grow and grow it ended up as 
 a complete patio complex with space for dining dancing and listening especially to the h4s the unit group who always 
 performed at their best at bbc finally when the great day came it was we who carried out the repatriation 
 procedures which brought the battalion and us as well back to calgary once back from leave we saw that the 
 job of reorganizing was going to be a big one having been summarily booted out of our former offices in 
 af 16 the headquarters was forced to seek shelter in the tower of c 4 here with only one phone 
 and it belonging to transport we struggled to catch up on an immense back log of work and simultaneously set 
 up an orderly room once we had done this we had our annual bash at winter training culminating in exercise 
 rotating rover as usual we administrators 0:ad 0:ministrators performed our varied tasks ignored by the sharp end until they wanted 
 something this is borne out by the csms account of the 
 39 hq coy 1 ppcli mar 72 sp coy 1 ppcli mar 72 
 40 enemy attack on the echelon the exercise culminated with a feeble attack by the enemy on the well sited 
 and heavily defended a echelon area the end came quickly when c company realizing that even though they were to 
 act as enemy they still had to draw their rations from us decided that victory on an empty stomach would 
 be a hollow one and discreetly withdrew 0:with 0:drew before a hail of empty ration cans and ice blocks editor 
 s note c company were somewhat annoyed when they learned that there were to be no further ration draws in 
 any case headquarters company headquarters company was officially formed on the unit s return from cyprus although it had existed 
 as wolseley company during the cyprus tour the company is now a grouping of the reconnaissance and weapons platoons the 
 signal and intelligence sections and battalion headquarters for the purpose of training and administration in cyprus headquarters company was centrally 
 located just outside the old walled city of nicosia at wolseley barracks a misnomer if there ever was one as 
 the only parts of the barracks we owned were the kitchen gymnasium and sergeants mess the actual barrack blocks and 
 headquarters 0:head 0:quarters building belonged to the nicosia law courts most of the working and accommodation areas were in a 
 number of old houses in the general area of the barracks the company included the nicosia district headquarters 0:head 0:quarters 
 two rifle support weapons platoons the communication platoon and the provost and medical sections one of the rifle platoons formed 
 the basis of an outpost and patrol detachment known as shakespeare force named after the mansion in which they lived 
 and also provided long range reconnaissance teams to patrol the rural area of nicosia district this rural area by the 
 way was over 600 square miles in extent villiger s spies as they were known had a few fairly exciting 
 run ins with the national guard and can tell more than the normal number of war stories the company was 
 a power in sub unit sports although somehow it failed to win the aggregate cup it did however win unit 
 titles in volleyball softball swimming track and field and that most grueling sport of all the obstacle race we also 
 placed a large number of men on the various battalion teams chief contributions to our prowess on the sports field 
 were ptes randy hansen paul leger bill todd and barry wannamaker cpl ken moynahan and capt lew mac kenzie we 
 also had the chimo club run by sgt squeeky reid and complete 0:com 0:plete with swimming pool in our area 
 the club was the scene of some memorable occasions such as when cpl brow anderson instructed pte dick lincoln in 
 the art of jumping through roofs and some great parties as the british contingent commander learned to his dismay one 
 of the communications platoon s duties was to run a weekly radio programme for the cyprus broadcasting company capt gerry 
 kerr was manager director and general factotum of this enterprise while sgt don ritthaler was the voice the programme featured 
 need we say it country and western music local and hometown news and sports results it also gave away a 
 weekly 5 000 prize to the person who first identified a certain record rumour has it that the communications platoon 
 financed their leaves with their winnings from this contest 
 41 in cyprus the company was run by a combination known as smiling bob and happy jack this duo was

 45 second battalion our first task of the new year 1971 was to perform as umpire staff and enemy force 
 for a brigade winter exercise named northern guard the exercise took place in dundurn saskatchewan a camp that closely resembles 
 the far side of the moon in january temperatures dropped as low as minus 40 degrees fahrenheit and at times 
 the main concern of all ranks was primarily survival mechanical and mental equipment tend to function quite slowly under extremely 
 cold conditions this is invariably one of the important lessons learned on winter exercise february saw the recce platoon participating 
 in a long range patrolling exercise to practise winter survival techniques and aerial resupply march and april were devoted to 
 specialist qualification courses on all weapons vehicles and communications equipment c company had an extremely busy time during this period 
 not only with specialist qualifications but they also spent three weeks in the high arctic exercise new viking subjected the 
 company to the most difficult of circumstances nonetheless they managed to find time to emerge as overall champions during the 
 fun and games competitions on the regimental birthday march the 17th april was the month of the surprise of all 
 surprises as the officers somehow defeated the sergeants at the annual games night apparently without any underhanded scoring techniques also 
 in april the honourable john mckeag lieutenant governor of manitoba inspected the unit on kapyong day and the united states 
 consul general mr william b kelly was the guest of honour at the kapyong mess dinner held that night in 
 the officers mess may and june were active months for the unit with extensive time spent in the field exercising 
 in all phases of war this period marked the first time the battalion had exercised in its entirety since the 
 return from north west europe in the summer of 1970 the battalion had the pleasure of having c company of 
 the first battalion placed under its command for waincon 71 in early july the unit played host for a week 
 to militia units putting them through their paces during milcon 71 this was followed by extensive 0:exten 0:sive support to 
 the summer student employment programme august saw c company again on the road to suffield alberta for user trials on 
 nbc clothing and equipment during september the unit conducted annual weapons classification and prepared for exercise running jump which exercised 
 the unit in a long range deployment 1500 miles by air at this time the unit also welcomed our new 
 british exchange officer capt paul truman from the queen s regiment november was filled with inspections as the unit was 
 subjected to two annual inspections in one week one by the commander i combat group and the other by the 
 base commander winnipeg the battalion was fortunate 0:fortun 0:ate to host mrs a hamilton gault for a few days in 
 november when she stopped over from her visit with the third battalion for their presentation of colours as the year 
 drew to a close preparations were under way for a series of company winter exercises in eastern manitoba during the 
 months of january and february

 47 exercise new viking as a resort area churchill manitoba in march and april fails to fulfill even the bare 
 minimum prerequisites for a newly qualified pay level 3 soldier on exercise new viking the holiday amenities are restricted to 
 those he carries on his back or pulls in a toboggan simply stated churchill and environs are at best cold 
 barren and desolate this then was the setting for c company 2 ppcli on its first all expense paid trip 
 to canada s northland in 1970 the arrival of c company aboard a ci3o hercules aircraft in churchill on 31 
 march 1971 caused a slightly greater concern to the exercise new viking staff than previous serials it was the first 
 company size organization 0:organiza 0:tion to participate in northern training the next seventeen days were spent in the field under 
 arctic canvas eating hard rations and practising the more subtle aspects of movement and survival in the arctic needless to 
 say the affects of a 20 degree f temperature and a 15 mph wind motivated everyone to carry out their 
 tasks correctly and above all quickly although the company was scheduled to spend a week perfecting survival techniques in churchill 
 and a week on partol out of coral harbour on southampton island the cancellation of its airlift at the eleventh 
 hour meant that an alternative patrol route had to be found to be sure it was and for eight days 
 the company tramped the tundra south of churchill in search of a party of parachutists in all the company covered 
 some 61 miles through cold storms and white outs looking for the elusive foe but being fictitious he was never 
 found the departure for the south was also plagued by aircraft delay the company finally departed on 17 april the 
 extra time was well spent however one day on a much needed shower and change of clothes and another on 
 a tour of the eskimo museum in the town of churchill thereafter 0:there 0:after the only thing left was the

 new viking waincon 71 the end of may 1971 saw the return of 2 ppcli to camp wainwright after an 
 absence of several years for some of us it was a return to a familiar place but for most of 
 the unit it was a new and interesting experience the road party left winnipeg on 26 may and the remainder 
 of the battalion moved by air on 28 29 may as usual waincon started off with a bang on arrival 
 it was discovered that our assigned bivouac area had been burned out and that a new area had to be 
 prepared according to major wharton it was just like the part ii exams the battalion was indeed fortunate to have 
 c company 1 ppcli commanded by capt richard rimmer placed under our command for phase 11 they performed well indeed 
 and were a valuable and much appreciated asset the pace of the field training portion of waincon 71 was hot 
 and heavy in addition to the normal sub unit training all companies participated in airmobile and watermanship training and in 
 the battalion controlled exer

 death of cpl avery in a tragic accident on the grenade range on 12 june we took part in the 
 1 combat group track and field meet although the cries of wait till next year echoed loudly maj neadow and 
 his team deserve credit for a fine showing despite the little training they received our congratulations should also go to 
 the b company forced march platoon for their tremendous effort in placing second in the forced march competition special mention 
 must also be made of the battalion small arms team for their outstanding display of skill during the combat group 
 small arms competition in all the team won nine of fourteen trophies and were deservedly crowned as the 1 combat 
 group champions while all members of the team performed admirably and are worthy of mention the performance of capt dyck

 lcol de chastelain cd after winning the officers sergeants broom a 100 on the regimental birthday 
 49 also meriting special mention was the fine performance given by major bob dallison s a company on 20 june 
 it was obvious that the close harmony which existed between a coy 2 rcha ldsh rc 3 fd sqn 1 
 tacli 434 sqn 417 sqn and 540 sqn was the keystone in the great success of the firepower demonstration the 
 crescendo reached by this demonstration was a fine introduction to the brigade controlled exercise powder keg although it was the 
 first we had performed as a battalion in a formation exercise the unit gave a good account of itself the 
 exercise was a valuable training vehicle and provided a fitting climax to waincon 71 student summer employment program most of 
 us who took part in the student summer employment program 0:pro 0:gram felt it was an entirely new and challenging 
 experience the particular challenge was that unlike our past assistance and training with militia units this course was run on 
 civilian rather than military lines it took us all a little while to get accustomed to working under this concept 
 but in a surprisingly 0:sur 0:prisingly short time the young men on the course and the officers and men in 
 the battalion were working well together the course was designed to develop leadership and self reliance for students 16 to 
 22 years of age and was run in camp wainwright between 15 july and 25 august 1971 bush craft field 
 engineering navigation first aid defensive driving leadership methods of instruction and physical education were the subjects we taught to allow 
 our instructors to get some leave during the summer the course was divided into two phases in phase one the 
 battalion provided all administrative and instructional staff about 110 all ranks phase two saw the headquarters and some administrators supplied 
 by us with the instructional cadre and company administrative staff being provided by the ldsh rc the course was initially 
 commanded by major dallison with major wharton replacing him for the second phase sgts abson gallant shawcross 0:shaw 0:cross and 
 simpson were in command of the company administrative staffs the four instructional cadres each had ten instructors capt mac lean 
 and sgt fraser headed up the field engineering cadre with bush craft was capt whiting and sgt mcallister navigation had

 0:gation and initiative exercise in the wainwright training area intense heat and lack of the normal military discipline caused us 
 some headaches when one student as a result of his drinking water from a slough near cattaloe bridge was suspected 
 of having typhoid fever fortunately it turned out to be a false alarm the final exercise was hunger pains a 
 survival exercise in the alberta foothills near hinton in true fashion of that area the rain was coming down in 
 buckets by the time the buses arrived the students bore up well however and in a short time had constructed 
 very comfortable shelters throughout the exercise wo watters kept us well supplied with a daily ration run this was a 
 considerable achievement as he was supplying us from wainwright some 350 miles away

 long engineering trial dcge dreo 2 71 extended wearing trials of the new canadian chemical warfare protective coverall the trial 
 was conducted to determine the answer to two major questions the first did the coverall interfere with the ability of 
 the various users to perform their normal field tasks and second did the suit retain its protective 0:protect 0:ive capability 
 for a full 21 days under uncontrolled conditions when worn by infantry in the field to ensure the coverall received 
 as realistic a wearing 0:wear 0:ing as possible the company tested it against portions of the nato triptique for evaluation 
 of cw potective garments as well as participating in several controlled experiments and field exercises using cw training agents some 
 of the activities during the month were three 10 mile marches two cliff climbing tasks two track and field days 
 live firing occupation of a defensive position contaminated with a persistent agent surprise spray cw attacks on a defensive position 
 on foot patrols and on several long distance 0:dist 0:ance tactical road moves the scheduled trial events were anticipated to 
 be demanding and the fact that the coverall had to be worn 24 hours a day for the complete month 
 in temperatures averaging 75 degrees and with only 24 hours free time outside the confines of camp vacuum and the 
 coverall proved to be the requirement that demanded the best from everyone while it will be almost a year before 
 the technicians at dreo finish assessing and reporting on the protective characteristics of the clothing the trial was considered to 
 have achieved its purpose the cw clothing received 0:re 0:ceived the required amount of hard wear under field conditions and 
 a number of sops set out in the various training manuals were assessed under field conditions while the soldiers participating 
 in the trial would never admit to having enjoyed their existence inside their first issue charcoal suit there would be

 heavy pressure the battalion made a good showing and again as always when fighting the fantasians was triumphant some of 
 the more interesting happenings were a coy occupying battle positions all over the battalion area and never catching sight of

 training command band dance combo provided the music and the function was well supported by regular and associate members and 
 friends of the mess the levee went off with no more than the normal mishaps as visiting teams stumbled the 
 rounds and we hosted with clam chowder and moose milk informal parties ranged from acid rock through alice in wonderland 
 to steinhager and beer a number of training dinners were held featuring some very interesting lectures and debates the regimental 
 birthday celebrations were concluded with a mess dinner as the sergeants mess had employed their usual devious tactics in the 
 broom i 100 game that afternoon the officers were relatively restrained for the dinner following the kapyong day parade the 
 mess hosted the yip guests at a cocktail party due to the weather hot rums were much in evidence the 
 festivities were rounded out by a mess dinner that night the mess moved to the field in wainwright for most 
 of the summer during waincon and milcon during this time we hosted the icbt gp officers at a bar b

 the past pmc mwo jim earle and the incumbent pmc mwo ken snowdon and their committees for their splendid efforts 
 in arranging over thirty successful functions in the past year although each event could warrant special mention it is sufficient 
 to say whether it was a family dining in a candlelight dinner a bingo a kapyong dance a wine cheese 
 party a hallowe en hop a gala new years eve ball or a regular tgif evening every function was well 
 attended and well enjoyed many thanks to all honorary and associate members who joined us in our various 1971 mess

 sampled we extend our very special thanks to those many many sr ncos and wives who devote their time to 
 the cadet corps guides and brownies little league hockey and softball and other small fry activities which form so big 
 a part of the base social scene finally perhaps our biggest vote of thanks should go to a group whose

 61 third battalion when the unit returned home from cyprus several new faces joined the battalion headquarters team because of 
 changes in employment postings 0:post 0:ings and attendance on courses of some of the older members this new team was 
 faced with the task of trying to get some well deserved leave as well as getting the battalion ready in 
 two short months for waincon 71 however everyone pitched in and cooperation was evident all round by the time the 
 departure date for wainwright rolled around all was in readiness 0:readi 0:ness for the move and the members of the 
 team had managed to get some leave during the period the fateful day finally arrived and led by our transport 
 officer capt john de solla the first packet moved slowly through a sleeping victoria on a rainy morning towards schwartz 
 bay ferry terminal the move to schwartz bay by the remainder of the road party was an exhibition of military 
 precision with vehicle and packet spacing just perfect what began as auspicious turned into sheer chaos courtesy of the b 
 c ferries from schwartz bay to vernon b c a carefully planned convoy move looked like the retreat from moscow 
 whoever heard of a military convoy composed entirely of free runners somehow all the vehicles arrived in vernon with the 
 last ones arriving around 3 a m during the move from victoria to vernon an accident occurred just outside of 
 ashcroft b c the intelligence van under command of sgt bruce lloyd intelligence sergeant and driven by mcpl ernie berrow 
 blew a tire causing the van to flip and roll over a couple of times before it stopped a few 
 feet from the edge of a cliff sgt lloyd and cpl berrow were thrown clear of the vehicle with the 
 former suffering a cracked shoulder bone and numerous contusions while cpl berrow suffered a broken arm and contusions this unfortunate 
 accident caused the loss of two very valuable members of the headquarters team as well as our intelligence van for 
 the remainder of waincon 71 both ncos have since fully recovered and have once again resumed their duties after a 
 complete reorganization in vernon the road party departed for calgary the journey through the roger s pass was most pleasant 
 with the scenery resplendent under the sun of a beautiful blue cloudless sky from calgary to wainwright was uneventful except 
 that capt mike hodgson with his c company group decided that they would take a little side trip to visit 
 the bright lights of edmonton they arrived in wainwright many hours after the rest of us with vehicles sputtering coughing 
 and protesting from a distinct lack of fuel after a night spent in beautiful camp wainwright the road party moved 
 out to our bivouac area near bushy head hill to set up camp while various work parties were busy setting 
 up tents etc the crew from the intelligence section and in particular two wos who shall remain nameless were up 
 to a little horsetrading theft might be a more accurate term concerning 0:con 0:cerning the signal officer s office van 
 otherwise known as joseph s poker palace well it seems that tom joseph lost his poker palace and the intelligence 
 section liberated a van to replace the one which was destroyed during the road move much to danny s dismay 
 the battalion heaquarters complex was returned to its former glory and efficiency 
 62 operations and training during the first two weeks of waincon were primarily sub unit controlled thereby leaving battalion headquarters 
 as a coordinating agency ready to meet the requests of the rifle companies for training areas ammunition stores etc this 
 enabled the staff to implement and practise their sops from a static location before doing it for real on exercise 
 during field exercises battalion headquarters worked well when does it ever do otherwise the battalion and combat group exercises brought 
 to light an opportunity for improving and revamping existing techniques and procedures during the combat group exercise our dco assumed 
 command in the latter stages of the exercise when the co was declared a casualty to become an umpire he 
 had the pleasure of commanding the final battalion attack his only complaint was that the co took his van with 
 him after waincon 71 the majority of battalion headquarters personnel were committed to the support of milcon 71 after a 
 few days of sub unit training our gallant militiamen participated in what was essentially the same combat group exercise as 
 the regulars had done although it was a lot of hard work the exercise was beneficial to all with the 
 conclusion of milcon like the proverbial arabs the battalion 0:battal 0:ion folded its tents and bade farewell until next time 
 to wainwright all in all it had been a most memorable experience for the members of the battalion headquarters team

 eager enough to put a little of the old eightball behind leading their platoons in pt five minutes after awakening 
 as a coy was mechanized fcr waincon 71 its training was both rigorous and exciting with the challengs of mounted 
 operations being v eil met by the company personnel the frst two weeks cf company training were put to good 
 use by major paul hunter in exercising the company in the drills of mobilized warfare beginning at the lowest level 
 that of the individual rifleman and ending up with a series of company strength manoeuvers 0:man 0:oeuvers the apcs and 
 the men were put through their trials and by the time the battalion exercise began the entire company knew they 
 would do well 
 64 with the end of company training came the arrival of some twenty officer cadets of all corps for their 
 first indoctrination into the wily life of the infanteer wo j a petty cqms trained the young men for a 
 week then they were fitted into the company organization for the period of the brigade controlled operations the cadets seemed 
 well pleased with the experience and a coy enjoyed their swelling appearance in the ranks more people for the duty 
 roster other highlights of the summer might be mentioned the company party the house clearing at 0300 the carrier sliding 
 backwards downhill and the crossing of the ribstone three times consecutively by one sub unit without the benefit of a 
 bridge but these largely had best be forgotten for the sake of company pride however a coy no matter what 
 maintained its reputation as the hardest working outfit in the battalion this if nothing else will be well remembered a 
 platoon warrant officer s opinion so few properly trained command by the elite can accomplish the impossible so to the 
 patrician the writer introduces charlie company throughout 1971 we accomplished the impossible by being blessed with having in this company 
 all of the above the company first formed in the early spring consisting mostly of some of the most suspicious 
 characters on the instructor level as could ever be grouped good military term in one tidy establishment suspicion was the 
 byword pay level 3 training started with some of the finest young gentlemen and future patricias that canada could possibly 
 release in order to carry out the military commitments and tasks allotted to a battalion commander the first three weeks 
 of training were carried out in work point barracks drill theory and weapons periods were carried out with vigour the 
 comradeship 0:com 0:radeship and the art of working as a team were becoming quite evident with each passing week now 
 all the theory was to be put into practical use as we moved barrack boxes and kitbags to nanaimo training 
 camp and what for all was to be under the critical eye of our chief instructor csm john crawford one 
 of the best administered and completely enjoyable stays that staff instructors and candidates will remember for a long time may 
 28 1971 found pay level 3 completed and with two days to shake out and prepare for wainwright we departed 
 a company destined to accomplish and leave hopefully a name which will be written in the annals of 3 battalion 
 and was all major tasks were completed with determination by our recruit company and valuable experience was gained by all 
 especially our company commander capt barry ashton who was destined for better things himself at staff college did you know

 chance to renew old acquaintances with new viking staff sgt bill hodge is still there and as he says and

 viking friends we had accomplished all tasks and done a first rate job the thanks of all to our airborne 
 safety instructors sgt bill easton and sgt moe gagnon who accompanied us on the expedition home again and the completion 
 of remaining leave we bade farewell to our company commander capt barry ashton and wish him the best in all 
 future endeavours major don harris no stranger to charlie company took over the helm his reputation preceded him as all 
 of us at one time or another have had the pleasure of working with and serving under this fine officer 
 the company personnel with the exception of a few ncos selected the courses of their choice in order to qualify 
 to pay level 4 the company area seemed deserted with the exception of csm vardy s office staff catching up 
 after all the exercises with the never ending paper work in preparation for the annual staff inspection long hours and 
 the burning up of cpl kretchmar s typewriter accomplished a good for the company inspection well done christmas arrived and

 the group continued with the plan but not before hi jacking 12 loaves of bread the viking force promptly constructed 
 178 sandwiches utilizing an efficient assembly line system the trip from the airfield to the company base camp was uneventful

 were required for the hundreds of personnel who needed to be qualified 0:quali 0:fied was a substantial enterprise nevertheless the

 commander s inspection bgen c j a hamilton mbe cd and his staff arrived at work point on the 10th 
 of november the battalion was formed up on the parade square and gave the commander a preview of the presentation 
 of colours parade the commander warned the battalion to expect trouble during the presentation as the parade rehearsal for him 
 was too good he wondered aloud what the battalion was going to do during the ten days until the 20th 
 of november as there appeared to be too few problems to be ironed out in that period during the afternoon 
 the battalion bug out system was tested capt m r hodgson bgen hamilton s aide was told not to return 
 to the third battalion when he refused to disclose just how long we could expect to be tested as field 
 soldiers the commander realizing that we were all anxious to return to the presentation rehearsals did not dispatch the battalion 
 to the field over night however he did conduct a very thorough inspection of all personnel and their equipment cdt 
 brian brooks is still wondering what stroke of good fortune placed him in the company selected to demonstrate gas drills 
 it is a lot easier to breathe if you remove the plugs from the respirator brian the mortar and armoured 
 defence platoons volunteered to display their knowledge of their skills and must have impressed the commander as he stood down 
 the inspection before the wives received any calls to keep supper warm in the oven 
 70 presentation of colours the history of colours goes back for centuries they were used as a mark of distinction 
 between families and as a conspicuous rallying point in battle as armies began adopting the regimental system in the early 
 17th century each company was allotted a colour a custom which prevailed for about one hundred years since 1751 regiments 
 have been limited to two colours the sovereign s and the regimental the colour was trooped or paraded through the 
 ranks to enable every man to distinguish his rallying point on the battlefield the regimental colour ensured that the regiment 
 did not become separated in battle and its capture meant more than mere disgrace as its loss inevitably meant defeat 
 the colour was therefore carefully guarded although the colours are no longer of any practical use they have taken on 
 a much deeper significance to those who serve under them colours symbolize the spirit and loyalty of a regiment as 
 they bear its battle honours colours are treated with respect and admiration by all those who serve under them and 
 are in fact a regiment s most prized possession his excellency the right honourable roland michener cc cd accompanied by

 at the end of october four fifty man guards formed up on the parade square every morning and afternoon under 
 the direction of the regimental sergeant major chief warrant officer w h carlton with the help of the master warrant 
 officers warrant officers and non commissioned officers of the battalion the rifle drill was perfected until each fifty man guard 
 moved as a single unit the guard sergeant majors then took over and began perfecting the marching drills much credit 
 must be given to the guard sergeant majors for the effort put forward on the parade square they were mwo 
 crawford mwo bruce mwo groom and mwo hyhoryshen meanwhile the officers were engaged in periods of sword drill under the 
 adjutant captain o brien and the guard commanders major hunter major harris major foster and major winfield finally the two 
 echelons were put together and practice of the parade format began in earnest the guests began arriving on the 17th

 reviewed by brigadier general d s maclennan cd general maclennan congratulated lieutenant colonel 0:lieuten 0:ant 0:colonel roy and the third 
 battalion on a first class preformance and hoped the actual parade would be an equal effort but against the popular 
 belief that a good dress rehearsal means a poor performance the battalion marched on to the combined music of the 
 regimental 0:regi 0:mental band and the third battalion corps of drums for its finest performance 0:perform 0:ance yet on saturday 
 the 20th of november the sense of pride that all ranks felt on this occasion was illustrated by the movements 
 of every officer and man on parade the reviewing officer the governor general of canada voiced his congratulations to all 
 ranks for the excellent effort displayed as did also many of the guests and spectators the queen s colour and 
 the regimental 0:regi 0:mental colour were consecrated by the chaplain general brigadier general j cardy mc cd and were presented

 back her deepest regrets for not being able to attend the presentation and her blessings and best wishes to the 
 third battalion on this very special occasion following the parade a reception was held in the junicr ranks club for 
 all those who attended the parade it was estimated that approximately fifteen hundred people invaded the reception hall at this 
 function where the old guard were introduced to the governor general of canada from the reception the crowds moved to 
 a very popular area during the presentation period known as the better ole it was an all ranks mess which 
 was open twenty fcur hcurs a day for the duration of the presentation weekend the better ole was ably supported 
 by the ppcli association victoria branch whese members assisted in decorating and setting up the mess the building itself was 
 a mock up of a world war i bunker from which it got its name it seems that a world 
 war i british soldier once said to his complaining trench mate something to the effect that if he could find 
 a better ole said with a british accent he was welcome to it the phrase better ole became a common 
 expression of world war i outside the mess a gun emplacement was built of sandbags and equipped with a world 
 war i artillery piece the entrance to the building was built up with sandbags to simulate the entrance to a 
 bunker the inside decor consisted of camouflage nets on ceiling and walls ammunition b xes as seats and world war 
 i battle maps posted on the walls presentation weekend at the third battalion was also highlighted by formal balls in 
 all messes on the 20th of november and a mixed regimental dinner on the 18th in the officers mess at 
 the mess dinner majcr general ware presented the officers of the battalion with a silver figurine of a world war

 by company personnel the children also visited work point barracks to meet their friends in uniform and pay each company 
 a visit cpl don bernicky a driver the battalion has made available to the clinic to drive their bus had 
 a busy schedule during the four weeks of the campaign

 personnel and eating and drinking a supply of cokes and cookies about twenty of them were given a mountaineering 0:mountain 
 0:eering demonstration followed by an introduction to weapons at the macaulay point range the men of the band did their 
 part that day too by playing a selection of pop tunes for the youngsters the drive for funds was eminently 
 successful as the battalion achieved 138 of its quota or 5 873 00 a company was the most successful bringing 
 into the coffers 209 of its quota all sub units however did extremely well and their efforts resulted in the 
 successful completion of the united appeal for 1971 more important however the battalion has perpetuated 0:per 0:petuated the warm bond

 inadequate rations and quarters a second attempt on mt bianco was mustered after an initial failure there were 35 personnel 
 left from the 100 who started the course we left in late afternoon and had supper at a survival hut 
 halfway up the surface we continued all through the night scaling ice walls on large glaciers using headlamps once along

 over 20 new officers only two and one half months until the mess would be called upon to entertain the

 former officers of the battalion the preparations for the 20th of november moved ahead not always smoothly but inevitably towards 
 the goal however for some the pace of preparations was too much and the mess was the victim in the 
 form of a new door and the junior officers were the victors with one officer volunteering 0:volun 0:teering to be 
 the orderly officer for the next 15 days but time waits for no one and the mess was prepared and 
 ready for the pomp ceremony and honour to be bestowed on it over the week of the presentation events the

 official function in the form of the ppcli association luncheon the association and mess were again honoured by the presence 
 of major general ware and mrs a hamilton gault whose continuing appearance at all of the functions of the presentation 
 ceremony gave the events a touch of dignity and contact with the regiment s history for the mess december was 
 understandably a month of relaxation and some weeping as the mess bills of the previous month and the presentation 0:presenta

 82 sergeants mess in the past year numerous activities have been occurring within the 3 ppcli sgts mess during the 
 early months of the year jan feb and mar we along with the rest of the battalion were completing the 
 last half of our tour of duty in cyprus our mess organization in cyprus consisted 0:con 0:sisted of five independent 
 company messes headed by a general mess committee 0:com 0:mittee chaired by mwo john crcsswell each company mess was responsible 
 for their own social functions which seemed to be numerous a system of rotational weepers was devised whereby two of 
 the four company messes were active any given friday evening our fifth mess technically classed as a leave centre was 
 located in the seaside resort of kyrenia this mess didn t need to be included in the weepers schedule as 
 festivities of some sort or another always seemed to be underway it had sleeping accommodation 0:accommoda 0:tion for 20 members 
 where one could get away from the pressures of nicosia and just relax at the battalion level mess functions varied 
 from cricket matches with the royal engineers at dhekelia to the pomp and formality of full scale regimental mess dinners 
 one particular dinner of note occurred on the 11th of february when we were honoured to host the colonel of 
 the regiment major general c b ware dso cd the three battalion commanders the regimental adjutant and all three regimental 
 0:regi 0:mental sergeant majors this unique event came about by virtue of the regimental executive meeting in cyprus it was 
 indeed an honour to host such an illustrious gathering during our tenure of service in cyprus our affairs in the 
 victoria rear party mess were in the capable hands of mwo poncho fotheringham in fact he and his committee were 
 making such a profit they didn t feel it was necessary for the battalion to return home they did a 
 fine job of housekeeping 0:house 0:keeping which was appreciated by all members after a well deserved leave period mess activity 
 was minimal during the latter part of april and into may end may brought the annual wainwright 0:wain 0:wright concentration 
 for a month then into the militia concentration the mess committee had changed and was now chaired by the hardworking 
 mwo vardy away again on leave then back for the fall activities preceding 0:pre 0:ceding christmas the fall activities included 
 monthly bingos run under the watchful eye of wo roy aylesworth and cabaret evenings set up by entertainment chairman wo 
 vie fitzgerald and his committee all events successful though they may have been appeared to be just preludes to our 
 big night of the 20th of november the presentation ball this ball held after a very elaborate presentation of colours 
 parade was most successful the mess committee rather than use the limited mess facilities moved into the men s kitchen 
 and turned it into a gala palace not only did they incorporate the regimental theme but they tastefully included the 
 b c centennial aspect the music was supplied by an eighteen member orchestra from the university of victoria playing the 
 big band music the highlight was the arrival of his excellency the governor general of canada and mrs michener also 
 included in his excellency s party were the b c lieutenant governor and mrs nicholson mr laurie wallace the general 
 chairman of the centennial committee the colonel of the regiment mrs a hamilton 0:hamil 0:ton gault and our own commanding 
 officer lieutenant colonel p a roy cd 
 83 other events of the fall included the annual turkey bingo the turkey shoot and the krrc trophy shoot awards 
 for the k rrc shoot which determines the best small bore shot in the sergeants mess went to wo knobby 
 clarke as the top gun and to sgt gord wilkins went the infamous spoon which is symbolic of the lowest 
 score the mess year wound up with the highly successful new years ball always a highlight of the year this 
 ball seemed to have that little extra maybe people were making up for missing last year s ball to coin 
 a phrase everybody had a ball a rather varied year for the mess messes in the mediterranean wainwright 0:wain 0:wright 
 and victoria postings in and out creating new friendships unforgetable 0:unfor 0:getable functions and always the comradeship which is the 
 basis for any successful mess although we may not have as varied a year in 1972 we all look forward 
 to another year of active mess life junior ranks club the junior ranks club jrc of 3 ppcli did not 
 become active until september 1971 because of the battalion s commitment in cyprus and the waincon 71 summer concentration followed 
 by a leave period during july and august in september a combined meeting was held with the navy at hmcs 
 naden to discuss the tri service mess to be built on signal hill by the spring of 1974 the meeting 
 went well except for a disagreement over the name of the mess the navy suggested fleet club pacific which immediately 
 put the patricia element up in arms however it was decided that the name of the mess would not be 
 associated with any of the services no name was agreed upon at this time in september the entertainment schedule started 
 with the decision to have live entertainment at least one evening a week however it seems the single man always 
 presents a problem to get maximum turnout the single man must be able to get a date the problem was 
 solved with a liaison visit of the president with the head nurses of the jubilee and st joseph s hospitals 
 in victoria once the head nurses were convinced that the girls would be well looked after by the men of 
 the battalion they allowed their student nurses to participate en masse in the functions sponsored by the jrc these functions 
 included a single man s sports night in which the men challenged the nurses to volleyball and basketball followed by 
 refreshments and dancing also a singles dance was held on 26 september with the co operation of both hospitals and 
 it was a great success during the month of september the jrc decided to accept associate members this membership was 
 offered to ex members of the battalion also a lifetime membership was offered to those of the battalion who had 
 served twenty years or more the quotas for these memberhips were filled by the end of september on 6 october 
 the jrc held their first invite the boss night this was such a success that it was decided to hold 
 one every three months in future however arm wrestling is forbidden and everyone is requested to keep their shirts on 
 during the function it was also pointed out that no matter what kind of tarzan you are they still out 
 rank you

 third battalion sergeants mess mwo eh vardy cd on the evening of 22 october the sea element at hmcs naden 
 lost their mess club 44 in a fire the jrc immediately offered every assistance 0:assist 0:ance possible and made the 
 jrc available to all members of the sea element the jrc held a halloween dance on 29 october the prize 
 for the best costume was won by mrs d beerus the imaginative costumes were very well done a combined western 
 casino weekend was held on 13 and 14 november this was the first combined function with the sea element from 
 hmcs naden this function was a great success and more such functions are planned for the future by this time 
 the presentation of the colours weekend was getting very close the jrc was tasked with hosting an all ranks reception 
 after the parade on 20 november and opening an all ranks mess for the duration of the weekend at the 
 reception the rsm and pmc of the jrc greeted his excellency the right honourable roland michener cc cd governor general 
 of canada and his wife the yip party was escorted through the reception and the governor general was introduced to 
 the veterans of the old guard the governor general then presented the pmc of the jrc with a picture of 
 himself and his wife for the club 
 85 from the reception everyone proceeded to the all ranks mess called the better ole this mock up of a 
 world war i bunker was opened at 0800 hrs 18 november by lcol p a roy and mr mcllvenny president 
 of the ppcli association it was open 24 hours a day for the duration of the presentation weekend and it 
 never lacked supporters approximately 600 members attended the jrc presentation ball on the evening of 20 november at 2200 hrs 
 the yip party arrived the general comment among the ladies was that major general ware s medals were very cold 
 however the suggested solution was not that the ladies use more material in their dresses but that general ware warm 
 his medals this suggestion was put forward with all due respect by the jrc decorating committee on 5 december a 
 new committee was elected their first task was the planning of the christmas dinner which was held at 1200 hrs 
 22 december lcol roy read the greetings received by the battalion prior to the commencement 0:com 0:mencement of the meal

 the old year ended spectacularly with the jrc new year s ball 1971 was a year of many changes in 
 the jrc and many more are planned for 1972 sports the battalion arrived home from cyprus in time to take 
 a well earned vacation return to work for three frenzied weeks of preparation then load up and deploy to camp 
 wainwright for the annual concentration here plagued by a lack of equipment and practice time the unit fielded teams to 
 compete in the 1 combat group sports meet the softball team using borrowed gear and having only one week of 
 practice under their belts were eliminated in the first round by a well drilled team from 2 ppcli the track 
 team suffering under much the same handicap showed desire and determination by placing a respectable third in its competition an 
 inspired platoon from bravo company doubled across the start line under the command 0:com 0:mand of capt steve petzing to

 87 during the fall 3 ppcli settled into an active sports schedule once again at the battalion level teams were 
 organized in various sports to compete in leagues based in victoria and cfb esquilmalt the track and field team continued 
 to train and entered the vancouver island track and field championships although no personnel qualified for the b c championships 
 0:champ 0:ionships several second and third place ribbons were won in the men s open categories a cross country team 
 was organized and joined one of the most competitive 0:com 0:petitive leagues on the island after the first meet each 
 team s average time was computed and the difference between that time and the time of the winning team was 
 recorded as the team s handicap for future runs this handicap equalized the teams and constant improvement was necessary for 
 victory this system has motivated our runners to improve and to dedicate themselves to their training the battalion hockey team 
 masquerading as the cfb esquimalt buccaneers is competing in the vancouver island hockey league in victoria 0:vic 0:toria throughout the 
 season team play has been the rule and the results have yielded either first or second place during the latter 
 of the season as the season draws to a close we look ahead to the play offs and the zone 
 championships and support the team s quest for victory 3 ppcli has entered a team in the canadian forces volleyball 
 league on the base play in this league commenced in october and will continue until march they are doing well 
 and looking forward to the league and regional championships with several good players to choose from the team hopes to 
 be successful in its post season play the battalion soccer team played several exhibition games league play in victoria was 
 drawing to a close and the team was forced to be content with these few games until next spring an 
 active inter company sports program was adopted with competition in soccer ice hockey floor hockey and volleyball objectives of this 
 program 0:pro 0:gram establishing company spirit and stressing team play were reached early in the season the results can readily 
 be seen in the quality and closeness of the games of course victoria s climate being so conducive golf claims 
 many personnel almost all year round although the usual christmas game was halted by some unexpected snow the weather cleared 
 in time to allow the duffers to get into the swing of things with the start of the new year 
 it would be wise to mention those oft times besmirched and seldom heralded sportsmen among the battalion who spend their 
 weekends on the business end of a fishing pole a popular sport in victoria the fishing bug has hit several 
 members of the unit from the stories at work to the truth in the freezer it is not difficult to 
 see that our fishermen are normal the corps of drums april at last our six month tour in cyprus is 
 drawing to a close everyone is making last minute trips to cypriot tailors and boot makers and of course to 
 our commissary for duty free goodies to put in our hand baggage 
 88 all in all it was a pretty fair tour of duty for the corps of drums nobody was idle 
 long enough to get bored but it will be great to get back home hey the yukons are going to 
 be de commissioned maybe we ll be flying in 707 s no such luck the pet set must be on 
 the move again but no one complains about the few extra hours aboard we re heading in the right direction 
 after a couple of weeks leave in may that just seemed to flash by we commenced preparations for wainwright during 
 this time the corps 3f drums and a marching contingent took part in the victoria day parade and what a 
 wainwright it made the soggy nicosia winter seem almost arid in comparison with the heaters and tops of the brown 
 ford convertibles noperative we were more often than not soaked to the skin especially during that long road move preceeding 
 the combat group exercise july and august saw nco s from the corps of drums working on the student summer 
 employment programme in victoria vancouver and vernon and also at the pne around the middle of september we were pretty 
 well all back together 0:to 0:gether as a corps we played at officers and sergeants mess dinners and had the 
 kids from the george pearkes clinic up to hear us three times in november it was training in earnest for 
 the presentation with time out on the eleventh to lead the remembrance day ceremonies at the legislature buildings this task 
 is normally taken by the naden military band but they were away on bc centennial commitments at the time the 
 corps of drums was well received at the regimental association reception on november the 19th at the olde england inn 
 and then of course on the twentieth the presentation of colours parade where we combined with the regimental band to 
 put a finely trained battalion through its paces the weather and the audience were outstanding for the occasion considering victoria 
 s usual late november mood sgt tims acting platoon warrant officer though near apoplexy at times managed to get everyone 
 into scarlet tunics and pith helmets for our first parade in that attire we held our christmas dance now a 
 yearly event on the eighteenth of december and a good time was had by all this is one of the 
 few times we can all get together socially and it is always a memorable event fond farewells this year go 
 to sgt anderson who went to b company pte tokle who joined our sister battalion in winnipeg and to that 
 brae piper roddie mcleod who led us on several impromptu parades through wolseley barracks and the nicosia area he s 
 now taking up culinary artistry just across the road in the men s mess and thanks go to cpls lale 
 and mercer who loaned us their talents for the presentation parade but have since returned to other employment in the

 of july on arrival the bisley team proceeded 0:pro 0:ceeded to carry out preparatory training for the upcoming competitions which 
 among other events included a friendly competition shoot which was a resounding victory for our canadian team the bisley matches 
 began on the 12th of july and continued for the next six days the competitions included shoots with the ordinary 
 service rifle smg pistol and special target shooting rifles some six hundred top small arms shots from all parts of 
 the british commonwealth competed in the various service competitions as members of teams or as individuals the main team events 
 won by canadian competitors were as follows the african cup which is an inter unit competition fired using rifle and 
 smg in this event the team scored 211 points with the next nearest team scoring 128 points the brimsmead challenge 
 shield which is the deliberate 0:deliber 0:ate fire competition at ranges of 200 300 and 500 yards the hythe trophy 
 competition which is fired from standing and sitting positions the roberts challenge cup which is a 200 yard snap shooting 
 competition fired with the fn also won was the smg cup which is fired by a team consisting of four 
 members in addition to the competitions our teams won canadian teams placed second and third in the canada cup this 
 match was lost by only one point and third in the cheylesmore falling plates competition in individual events the author 
 of this article was fortunate to win the service pistol type competition 0:compe 0:tition when the smoke cleared and the 
 last rounds had been fired our canadian team could look on their achievements with justifiable pride the team won ten 
 trophies twenty three first place medals and twenty one second place medals this represented the most successful effort by any 
 canadian team competing at bisley and this was aptly demonstrated by a commentary in the daily telegraph that one team 
 should win so much is virtually unheard of hertz we can rent you a car without a mileage charge in

 101 the canadian airborne regiment the past year has seen quite a change of faces within the regiment many of 
 the originals have now returned to duty with their respective regiments the resultant influx of new blood has seen many 
 patricia s move into key positions in the regiment major bob stewart moved from his position as regimental major to 
 assume command of 2nd airborne commando 0:com 0:mando his replacement in the headquarters is another patricia maj dick cowling ex

 captain jim kempling moved to command f company the process of re badging is just now reaching many of those 
 in the regiment who were serving away from their units in 1970 in edmonton there seems to be a very 
 strong preference for the army of the west and new patricia s are appearing daily wo bert reed and sgt 
 fred schiweck formerly of the canadian guards are now both loyal patricia s many others have also indicated their preference 
 and are just waiting for the wheels to turn in cfhq the death of cwo dick buxton in september was 
 a great blow to the regiment and i am sure was felt deeply by patricias everywhere mrs buxton and family 
 are now settled permanently in edmonton the tempo of training in the regiment under the firm guidance of colonel h 
 c pitts qor of c has continued unabated the training year started with mountain school at kananaskis in august instructing 
 were sergeants hartman bolen miller and corporals peskett merritt goguen topham and frost a regimental battle school at wainwright followed 
 with a series of live firing battle runs ranging from section fire and movement to a company defensive position complete 
 with revetting a company bunker and enough wire to gladden the heart of many a korean vet the bulk of 
 the regiment headed for sunny gagetown in september to act as enemy force for the army of the east in 
 exercise running jump meanwhile a few stalwarts from f company under captain mike mckeown and mwo gerry rogers penetrated the 
 wilds of bowron provincial 0:pro 0:vincial park and down the bowron river in the tour of bc for an adventure 
 training exercise grey cup day in the regiment was celebrated by an officers ys sgts wos football game on the

 most of us emerged battered and bruised but feeling very fit during the same period the unit ran courses for 
 machine gunners anti tank gunners and drivers the sauna bath at kananaskis ski chalet was a welcome sight again this 
 year and eased the aching muscles after a hard day on the bangy boards while some have become quite proficient 
 on the 7 foot monsters others just don t have the killy touch as mwo gerry rogers will attest the

 the exercise nimrod caper iv covering the jungle the swamps the mountains and cockpit country lasts from 13 march to 
 25 april 1972 once again this summer we expect a fairly large turnover in personnel and once again we expect

 105 the royal green jackets 1971 on 31st december the regiment consisted of two regular battalions the ist and 2nd 
 battalions the royal green jackets a representative company which was formed on the ist of august on the reduction of 
 the 3rd battalion the rifle depot at winchester and a battalion of the territorial 0:territor 0:ial army the 4th battalion 
 the royal green jackets a decision was taken in october to re establish the 3rd battalion once more by expanding 
 the representative company to battalion strength this was tremendous news and early in 1972 they will reform the ist battalion 
 under the command of lieutenant colonel guy returned 0:re 0:turned in october to celle in germany after four months in 
 belfast where they had been responsible for maintaining law and order in the most volatile areas the city centre and 
 lower falls the latter a depressed area of bad housing and narrow streets gradually being re edevolped into high rise 
 flats is the catholic stronghold of belfast it has a history of republicanism dating back to the last century and 
 is very much under the control of the i r a the battalion was involved in many incidents from gunfights 
 with groups of armed men keeping various factions apart after football matches crowd control after bombing incidents and subduing crowds 
 of irate women banging dustbin lids to the escorting of a fish and chip van on its rounds unfortunately the 
 battalion was not without its casualties two of our men were killed and thirteen others wounded amongst them two officers 
 throughout their tour the battalion were subjected to a propaganda campaign by the i r a this campaign was in 
 many respects very effective and it usually consisted in capitalizing on incidents by trying to give a distorted 0:dis 0:torted 
 version of them to the press on one occasion the battalion was required 0:re 0:quired to search the house of 
 a well known i r a family and they had to break the lock to enter this was the sum 
 total of the damage done as soon as the officer and riflemen concerned left the scene the family wrecked the 
 inside of their own house and called in the press saying the military had done it fortunately in this case 
 a quick statement on television by the officer concerned gave the true story 
 106 the 2nd battalion which has been stationed in munster west germany since 1967 moved to londonderry in may the 
 battalion has taken over shacketon barracks at ballykelly together with the adjacent married quarters and is now firmly established there 
 lieutenant colonel welsh assumed command on the 4th of september from colonel mostyn since it began operations on the 9th 
 of june the battalion has been actively engaged almost continuously in londonderry city and the surrounding 0:surround 0:ing countryside the 
 pattern of events has involved riot control bomb attacks and sniper fire from gunmen the battalion has suffered its first 
 fatal casualty apart from this there has only been one serious casualty major alers hankey who was shot while commanding 
 his company on the streets and severely wounded there have been numerous minor injuries to date the r m o 
 has inserted over 250 stitches the representative company having formed at netheravon on the 2nd of august was deployed to 
 belfast on the 11 th of august and came under command of the ist battalion members of the company came 
 under fire within a few hours of arriving in belfast possibly creating a record for speed between formation operational deployment 
 and coming under fire it took over responsibility for the lower falls area the rifle depot under command of lieutenant 
 colonel carleton smith is now permanently established at winchester where it will be joined in 1974 by the light infantry 
 depot to form a common depot to serve the whole of the light division although the numbers enlisting for men 
 s service is still below our requirement the latest recruiting figures are improving 0:improv 0:ing and the number of boys 
 joining is most encouraging and augurs well for the future the 4th volunteer battalion is commanded by lieutenant colonel cornell 
 with companies in london oxford and aylesbury recruiting is going well and the battalion has over five hundred officers and 
 riflemen it is particularly encouraging that the average age in this battalion is 23 a very different situation from the 
 territorial army before re organization in 1967 the battalion camped for two weeks this year in the isle of man 
 where training facilities were excellent and the lights of douglas attracted back several volunteers for their summer holidays the battalion 
 has a very active free fall parachute team all volunteer riflemen with the exception 0:excep 0:tion of the leader lieutenant

 myself from the 2554 princess patricia s 0:pat 0:ricia 0:s canadian light infantry cadet corps were sent to edmonton to 
 participate in the alberta master cadet examinations i was fortunate enough to place among the top five in the province 
 and was chosen to proceed 0:pro 0:ceed to guyana on the caribbean cadet exchange there were five countries to which 
 cadets were being sent jamaica barbados trinidad grenada and guyana guyana is the only mainland camp of the five the 
 rest are all on islands guyana formerly british guiana became a republic in may 1966 it is situated on the 
 north coast of south america between surinam on the east brazil on the south and venezula on the west the 
 prime minister of guyana is forbes burnham mostly a jungle country the majority of guyana s mixed racial population 0:popula 
 0:tion lives along the north coast georgetown is its capital and is the centre of most of the industries it 
 was early in july that i left calgary on the first leg of the journey i travelled to edmonton where 
 after a final briefing i left on canadian forces aircraft for ottawa on arriving in ottawa a department of national 
 defence bus carried us to cfb petawawa after arriving in petawawa we the albertans met the rest of the cadets 
 from across canada and proceeded to make friendships that would last over the summer the two weeks that were spent 
 in petawawa were a retraining course designed to help us in conducting courses it was mostly a refresher course with 
 cadets giving instruction to other cadets issuing of standard equipment and uniforms was also carried out interesting aspects of the 
 petawawa stay were a day on the ranges a trip to the chalk river nuclear station and the privilege to 
 be spectators at the dress rehearsal of the change of command ceremony at the base after our two week stay 
 we went to connaught ranges outside ottawa the staging area for our flight while there we were taken into ottawa 
 where we were allowed to visit the national war museum it was on july 23rd that we left for the 
 caribbean from cfb uplands after a few hours of flying time we arrived at jamaica a one hour stop over 
 was held at which time the cadets not staying in jamaica were able to watch those who were staying being 
 met by a jamaican cadet guard of honour it was very interesting as it was our first contact with the 
 caribbean drill it was also our chance to get used to the heat and humidity of the tropics after the 
 stop over we were again on our way along with cadets from jamaica and area our next stop was barbados 
 where another stop over was held after picking up barbados cadets we were again on our way this time to 
 trinidad while in the air the guyana bound cadets found out we would have to stay overnight in trinidad 
 120 the next morning after an hour s flying time we arrived at timehri airport we were greeted by members 
 of the guyana defence force and were then trucked to the capital georgetown while driving through the countryside we were 
 able to form a few first impressions about guyana its people and its weather the countryside was a lot different 
 than what i was used to it is very flat with most of the land that i was able to 
 see either cultivated with sugar cane or left to jungle we drove through many small towns on the way and 
 the people were very friendly they waved and smiled encouraging us to be right at home the weather was the 
 biggest surprise to us it continually stopped and started raining without warning we never really got used to this throughout 
 the summer 1 would estimate that in the hour or so it took us to travel from the airport to 
 georgetown that it rained no less than five times even though these were downpours due to the sun continually shining 
 when the rain stopped we were still practically dry by the time we reached the city our home base for 
 our stay in georgetown was queen s college this is their equivalent to our elementary and secondary schools we were 
 billeted in rooms according to rank and this put all the canadians in one room an hour after our arrival 
 we were taken to the auditorium where we were greeted by the commander of the camp and the commander of 
 the guyana defence force after the introduction we were allowed our first chance to see the city as we left 
 the school we ran into a man who turned out to be the band officer of the georgetown police force 
 band he invited lis to attend any of the concerts he gave every week end we attended one the next 
 week and were surprised at the calibre of the band it was as good as any of the bands i 
 have heard in canada we attended a dance the first night at the pegasus hotel which is purported to be 
 georgetown s finest we were once again pleasantly surprised 0:sur 0:prised at the way we were accepted the first week 
 was spent in attending lectures on voice procedure map using weaponry man management and drill we in turn gave the 
 caribbean cadets lectures on some general aspects of first aid most afternoons were spent enjoying conducted tours i j j 
 o the first tour was to the museum of guyana displays included models of most of guyana s main industries 
 descriptions of most of the plant and animal life historical displays reflecting aspects of guyana s history the second tour 
 was to the botanical gardens and zoo located within a block of the prime minister s residence most of the 
 animals were native to guyana we were familiar with many of the names of the animals but this was our 
 first opportunity to see most of them the third tour was to the rice marketing board located on the waterfront 
 it is one of guyana s main industries we saw the rice arriving from the plantations on boats how it 
 was loaded graded cleaned and packaged another tour was arranged to the demarara sugar refinery but due to illness i 
 was unable to attend i was also unable to attend the tour of the bauxite plant at mac kenzie after 
 the first week in georgetown we moved out to the guyana defence 0:de 0:fence force base at timehri our first 
 function there was to participate in a 
 121 parade being held to celebrate jamaica s independence the last two weeks were almost entirely devoted to training in 
 jungle warfare this was put into practice when we went into the jungle for an overnight exercise practise was conducted 
 in camouflage silent movement repelling an attack and also setting up a night camp the next day we were shown 
 various methods of crossing jungle rivers one method of which we actually practised the last few days were devoted to 
 giving us a chance to unwind first a range day was held during which we were allowed to use the 
 weapons used by the guyana defence force secondly we were allowed to visit georgetown every day the focal point of 
 this was the church where we would meet to return it is reported to be the largest wooden building in 
 the world a drill competition was held with all cadets participating a dance was held the second last night of 
 camp and music was supplied by the guyana defence force steel band after rock combo this was a very pleasant 
 experience 0:ex 0:perience an international night was held before we left with all cadets participating an awards day was held 
 and every cadet was given a certificate saying he had attended the camp on august the 15th we headed back 
 to canada completing a tour that could be described as extremely interesting bar x steak house serving the finest alberta

 about what the men would be facing during their tour another project undertaken was the purchase of material and the

 i would like to first report on my visit to our colonel in chief lady patricia back in september the 
 colonel of the regiment advised me that he would attempt to arrange a visit for me to the colonel in 
 chief during my london stay from the sth to the bth of november the purpose of the visit was to 
 convey to the colonel in chief the wreath of laurel that had been prepared for the third battalion the purpose 
 of carrying the wreath to england may appear to be a sentimental one but none the less it was to 
 accord our colonel in chief the opportunity of taking a physical part in the presentation of her wreath to the 
 battalion in the company of colonel vr schjelderup dso mc cd and lieutenant colonel ga gunton cd we visited lady 
 patricia ramsay ci cd at 1130 hrs sunday the 7th of november 1971 we found the colonel in chief to 
 be in excellent spirits enthusiastic and inquisitive about the activities of her regiment and the association 
 128 lady patricia gave her blessing to the wreath and remarked on the fact that it appeared to be an 
 exact duplicate of the original she instructed me to carry it back to canada and give it to general ware 
 with the stipulation 0:stipula 0:tion that he decorate the regimental colour of her third battalion with the wreath of laurel 
 as you are aware this was done on the afternoon of the 20th of november 1971 now for my annual

 when it comes to the date of publication if all writeups 0:write 0:ups reports returns etc could be received by

 excellent the serving and former officers in the edmonton area were faced with a delemma when it was realized that 
 a similar celebration in the form of a mixed formal dinner was being held in the officers mess at griesbach

 evening and others arrived during the latter part of the evening

 opportunity to bid them a fond farewell he did a magnificent job as guest speaker and added further colour to 
 his performance by playing a tape recording of the late brigadier a hamilton gault s participation at the planting of 
 the maple tree at the frezenberg memorial some years ago other guests included members of the loyal edmonton regiment 4

 retirement was the reviewing officer in company with lieutenant colonel piasta remembrance day 11 november 1971 our branch again participated 
 in the annual legion memorial day parade held in downtown edmonton another first for us and indeed gratifying was when

 the parade officials requested and received permission to lay a wreath at the cenotaph during the wreath laying phase of 
 the ceremony following the march past with the lieutenant governor grant mcewan taking the salute we retired to the legion

 fellowship and blind financial faith we had a number of outstanding social events during 1971 10 february smoker hmcs bytown 
 officers mess 11 may buffet and sociable sip transportation officers mess 7 december cocktail party transportation officers mess the latter 
 event was of particular significance because it was the first occasion in many years that our branch members attended an

 is the imminent closing of the transportation officers mess we all have many fond recollections 0:recol 0:lections of our activities 
 there we once again express our gratitude to the management and staff for their many services extended to us over 
 the years a reconnaissance party is afoot looking for new digs for future events the officers and members of the 
 ottawa branch of the association extend to all patricias the very best wishes for the year 1972 montreal branch as 
 in recent years the montreal branch has relied more on personal contacts between members and entertainment of visiting firemen on 
 an informal 0:in 0:formal basis than at organized meetings this is now a great big city and the main support 
 comes from veterans of world war i whose numbers are affected by the relentless passage of time we are fortunate 
 to be able to list the number of members we do although not all of them can be active also 
 the contingent of patricia officers and other ranks stationed at mobile command headquarters has fallen off badly in the past 
 year we are always 
 141 delighted to see as many of them as possible and must record once again our appreciation of the support 
 they give us our last formal function was held on february 8 this year at first we were going to 
 have a dinner restricted to members of the branch and various old friends who have no regimental affiliation here in 
 montreal at the last minute we changed it to a cocktail party to include our delightful feminine ancillary troops and 
 the effect of their presence was magical about fifty people turned out and we were pleased to see such old 
 friends as mr and mrs reg jones who now live in cornwall archie mackinnon was expected in from the boston 
 area with a contingent of one or two old sweats who also miss their regimental affiliations and who were looking 
 forward to joining forces with the patricias in montreal but unfortunately the old flu bug felled all of them however 
 a strong fighting patrol from ottawa consisting of harry cotton and kerry dunphy showed up and added greatly to the 
 enjoyment of the occasion it should be emphasized that we are delighted to hear from or to see visitors from 
 other parts enough of us hang around the centre of the city to be in a position to engage in 
 light skirmishing if circumstances warrant and it brings real pleasure to us to see anyone our affectionate and fraternal greetings 
 are extended to all of you united kingdom branch the united kingdom branch observed the 56th anniversary of the battle
