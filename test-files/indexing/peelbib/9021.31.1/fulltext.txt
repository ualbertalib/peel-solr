 the opening of the canadian north mccrurn elizabeth m a register of service 18701914 mail service complaints are frequently made
 by the settlers in the district south of lethbndge about the inadequacy of their present mail service the people of
 cardston which is now a large and thriving village and the centre of a well settled district in which there
 are several smaller villages have only a weekly mail service and the settlers living on pot hole have to come
 to lethbridge for their mail a distance of from 17 to 25 miles the manner in which the cardston mail
 is carried is also unsatisfactory instead of being pushed through as rapidly as possible in a light and fast travelling
 vehicle it is carried in a heavy waggon which necessitates a two days journey between cardston and lethbridge the southern
 settlements are steadily growing all the time and new villages are gradually springing up already there are two other post
 offices which receive their mail from cardston and a third will shortly be required under these circumstances the settlers feel
 that they are entitled to a better mail service than they now receive it is not enough for the government
 to endeavour to bring settlers into the territories but if they desire to retain those who do come in they
 should also endeavour to supply them as far as possible with the conveniences of life it is perfectly possible that
 if the people of cardston were given a semi weekly mail and only one day allowed for the trip each
 way it might in the immediate present cost the government more than the southern post offices bring in but that
 is neither here or there an expenditure of this kind will in the end amply repay the government not only
 would it assist in keeping in the country those who have already settled in it but it would also assist
 in inducing others to come into a country where they see that the convenience of settlers is thought of and
 considered by the government it is earnestly to be hoped that the new post master general will give this matter
 careful attention and will view it in a generous and broad minded way the settlement of the country is of
 more importance than that the receipts of the postal department should equal its expenditure and no one would gmmble at
 a slight increase in the expenditure of that department when it is for the benefit of settlers and the encouragement

 would like to drive a stage generally form their impressions during the warm and balmy weather of the summer months
 when there is no danger of freezing to death and there are no obstacles to smooth sailing about the first
 cold makes them calculate that the stage driver has not such a soft snap after all and they are just
 about right there is no occupation in the world that looks more easy and pleasant at times and there is
 none which at other times is more difficult or that requires more care genuine courage and good management in the
 summer the weather is warm and the rivers easily crossed when the first cold weather comes the hills are slipper
 y and the river mean and then it is that the stage driver requires all the self possession nerve and
 skill that nature may have endowed him with all the routes going out of macleod are difficult ones to drive
 over at such a time all these routes are fortunate in possessing careful and skilful drivers at the head of
 the list of northwest drivers frank pollinger reigns supreme frank is known and admired from winnipeg to the rocky mountains
 and north as far as frenchman s butte where he took part in that memorable battle he has driven over
 nearly all the four and six horse stage routes in the western states where his reputation is just as high
 as it is here every horse in his team knows him and a word from him is as good as
 a club in the average driver s hands frank is a deserved favorite and the average passenger considers himself in
 good luck if he gets a seat alongside of him except in cold and stormy weather when polly generally has
 to hold it down alone unless there is a full house all the others are good drivers and good fellows
 the stage driver has generally a very keen sense of his duty he will always do more for his employers
 and his horses than he will for himself the last trip in from benton the driver got into difficulty in
 the river at frank strong s crossing with the thermometer down below zero he worked in water nearly up to
 his waist for some two hours without getting d ry or warm he came straight through to macleod arriving after
 dark in the evening and encased in a solid mass of ice even then he delivered his mail and would
 not stir from his seat until he had made every endeavor to report to the collector of customs it was
 a long time before he could thaw out his clothes sufficiently to get them off yes stage driving looks pretty
 when everything is favorable but the man who undertakes it in winter and gets there is none of your ordinary
 kind of man but is stamped with a superiority which only requires the opportunity to make him a hero all
 honor to him he may be a hard case but his thousand and one virtues and good qualities cover a
 multitude of faults the macleod gazette november 23 1886 32 a tribute to the red river cart by john maclean

 canada was the red river cart mention its name and you published later as he moved to various parishes in

 none who could interpret the music around the cheerful fire and renewed the thrilling of the cart so well as
