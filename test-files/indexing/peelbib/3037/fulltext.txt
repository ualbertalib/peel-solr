 formatio n and advice may be obtained prom w d scott superintendent of immigration ottawa cai ada 3 obei smith
 commissioner of immigration winnipeg canada early history he would have been called a dreamer of the most imaginative class who
 35 years ago when the northwest country became a possession of canada prophesied the present prosperity in the lapse of
 so short a period of time that there were men in the country who at that time knew it was
 a valuable heritage goes without saying but that it should so soon be an important element in swaying the future
 of the whole confederation was scarcely to be expected but it is none the less a real fact that many
 of the present and late serious undertakings of the canadian government are the result of a conviction that there are
 in western canada the undeveloped resources to warrant it three transcontinental railways have been financed through on the ample assurance
 that there is business in the west to warrant their construction aqd resources to liquidate the consequent indebtedness manitoba in
 the eastern portion of the country was created a province a year after the purchase from the hudson s bay
 company in 1870 and so marked was its progress from the moment transport facilities were established to years later in
 the c p r from st paul that all doubts were dispelled and ample preparation made for the settlement of
 the country in 1882 the western country was tapped by the extended main line of the c p r that
 year also territorial government wa s established the remaining outlying country being converted into four territories alberta assiniboia saskatchewan and
 athabasca with a central government for all at regina on account of the unprecedented growth of the country in the
 interval some 23 years the territorial government is now discarded and the four territories are converted into two provinces alberta
 and saskatchewan ar d given the fullest form of responsible government the few thousand people of those days have grown
 into the half million of today and the change was found to be necessary for the fuller settlement and expansion
 of the country comparative growth let us now note some of the evidences of advancement the first bushel f wheat
 was shipped in 1882 in fact the first shipment from manitoba merely as a sample was made in 1877 in
 1904 there were under all crops excepting hay 1 575 000 acres in the western provinces producing 4 wheat bushels
 17 250 350 oats 18 250 640 barley 2 350 420 realizing a total of a bout 18 500 000
 for the farmers in manitoba there were grown in 1904 41 600 000 bushels of wheat and othçr 0:othcr farm products
 in proportion when manitoba entered confederation iii 1870 its entire population of whites and half breeds was less than 10
 000 today its entire population is over 350 000 its capital winnipeg has 100 000 of a population and brandon
 portage la prairie and a score more of towns have from 2 000 to 10 000 each as intimated above
 the first mile of railway was built in the country in 1880 and today there are over 6 000 miles
 of road in operation and further extensions are going ahead as fast as men and money can build them there
 are two truilk lines in the country the c p r and the canadian northern with the grand trunk commencing
 its transcontinental line in addition to these trunk lines all systems are extending branches to all sections where there are
 settlements to patronize them grain elevators the grain elevator development is another assurancof the wonderful n expansion of the country
 the onefourth of the whole area or about 95 000 00 b acres of the country traversed by railways being
 now fairly supplied by elevators r in all there are 1 015 of them in the country with a combined
 capacity of 27 683 000 bushels and erected at a cost of over 55 000 000 in addition to these
 elevators al the head of the lakes have storage capacity of 18 200 000 fourteen years ago the entire storage
 capacity of the elevators was 7 628 000 bushels today it is 41 600 000 and increasing yearly from flv
 o ten million bushels at the settlement of the country will be in the next ten years may well be
 imagined frcitn the fact that last y th e immigration as over 146 000 souls ro limit to the grain
 producing area there are those who believe the grain producing area of the coñntry 0:conntry must be limited but results tell
 a different story in the northern peace river country 900 miles north of the international boundary ‘ wheat is grown
 every year 62 to 65 lbs to the bushel from 20 to 30 bushels to the acre and matures in
 107 days from ‘ sowing the length of day and therefore the greater amount of summer heat in 1 b
 e 24 hours fully compensate for the disadvantages of latitude as there are already thrifty settlements with their r t
 mills large fields of grain and o s herds of live stock in that nortl umry it only requires the
 extension f the railways now pushing on to i s confines to bring it to the front as a field
 for most extensive and profitable settlement the whole country embraces an area of over 385 000 000 acres and deducting
 water and broken land there is plenty of wheat growing territory to produce 20 times ever the re uirements of
 great britain as wheat can be growr at 7 50 per acre with wages to the men doing their own
 work besides and as year in and year out the yield and price are 20 bushels at 60 cents the
 profits are 4 50 per acre this is a very conservativc estimate assuming there are 2 00 000 000 acres
 in the country out of the 385 000 000 fit for wheat growing and that it wa all cropped by
 say one million farmers on 200 acres each the yield at 20 bushels would be 4 000 000 000 bushels
 and the profits nine hundred million dollars of course all this area will never be under crop at once but
 we use the lgures merely to show the almost incomprehensiblç 0:incomprehensiblc possibilities of the country ‘ 11 live stock as live
 stock doubles every three years and grows like wheat while the farmer is sleeping we expect that this ‘ will
 always be one of the leading features of the agricultural industry as the pacific or warm winds melt the snow
 in alberta almost as rapidly as i t falls and renders the winter freezin nj uch milder than in the
 farther east dhiintry it mak s the western province the most ideal ranching country in the world there herds of
 ‘ live stock live ou on the open prairie the entire year through and are in good nditioh every spring
 the native grasses are highly nutritious and retain their qualities the whole winter through making winter feed as inexpensive as
 summer pasturage large tracts of lands for ranching purposes are leased from the governméi 0:governmei t at mere nominal figures and
 the salaries of a couple of men are all the cost of raising large herds of horse pr cattle dr
 flocks sheep as the easter ‘ emintry is reached winter feeding becomes necessary but in no portion more than three
 or four months in the year it is even then inexpensive as plenty of wild grass can be cut in
 the summer and saved for little more than the cost of handling 13 as 2 835 516 worth of live
 stock was marketed in that country in six months of last year an idea may be formed of the proportions
 it may be led to attain when the country becomes fully settled up dairying this is the third leading business
 of the northwest farmer and may like the others be developed while the farmer is slçeping 0:slceping it is found that
 on account of the cost of farm help and to avert the expense of erecting suitable buildings for the purpose
 the co operative system is decidedly the best under it the entire management is in the hands of the government
 under expert operatives though control of sales etc rests with the patrons the farmers simply deliver their milk or cream
 usually the latter at he dairies receive monthly advances and balances of proceeds of sales at the close of the
 year when all operations are placed in the hands of a few the patrons get the best returns and are
 invariably pleased with the results educational while contemplating immigrants may feel fully assured on the climatic conditions and agricultural capabilities
 of 1 c ii the country they want to be equally satisfied with thc facilities for educating their families we
 niav state there are no state aided churches all are free to worship as they please the schools are free
 and non denominational national there is no tax for attejdance the government defrays the greater part of the cost of
 support of a highly certificatcd staff of teachers there arc schools in all country districts where there are a dozen
 pupils to attecd them and the tax is rarely more than 4 a year on every quarter section in short
 we may here remark there are no taxes in the country only as the people create them for improving roads
 building bridges and supporting schools as each province alberta and saskatchewan under the new provincial autonomy bill receive at the
 start f øin the federal government l i 00 00 fl a year there will be but very incor siderable
 taxation for any and all provincial purpose they will be the lightest taxed countries in the known world a matter
 of much moment to the settler as the schools have increased from 76 in 1886 with a government grant of
 8 908 to 845 with a grant of 273 600 in 1904 it is ln additional evidence the country ic
 drgiiig ahead in leaps and bounds 17 fuel this is the bugbear of many of the prairie countries in western
 ganada however there are but few districts without an ample supply of timber and as coal of the best quality
 is everywhere present no farmer being more than 200 miles distant from a mine and t he price nevermore than
 4 5 oper ton to him at his door ‘ it is readily seen the fuel problem is already solved
 joint stock companies the increase of these is another assurance of the rapid growth of the country in 1887 there
 were but fotir of them with a capital of 137 000 now there are 282 with a capital of 19
 809 000 these assurances carry their own arguments now ready as showi i above the railways are everywherd tapping new
 districts where free land is offered to all regardless of religion or nationality even in some of the older parts
 there is yet plenty of free land manitoba ‘ having 1 500 000 acres of it when settlers prefer locat
 19 ing in the older districts they can always buy from the railways the hudson s bay company or other
 corporations at from 3 50 per acre up according to locality and all can do what present settlers are doing
 with enterprise and energy money can of course be used to grear advantage as indeed it can be in any
 new country but there are thousands of men now well off in the country who came in without a dollar
 who hired out with farmers railways or others till they made sufficient to take up homesteads and start for themselves
 any single man or even married man when husband and wife are a 1 e and willing to work can
 do this the great opportunity is however open to the man who can sell out his property elsewhere at some
 price and bring in some stock which always comes free and make a start for himself but two or hree
 years residence are necessary to make all such comfortable the land is waiting and all that is necessary is for
 the industri us and enterprising to come in and possess it the inconvenience of pioneering to the man of small
 means are of course present but two or three years faithful work will overcome all these and wealth and con
 fort will then follow rapidly as certainly as the sun rises and sets to say that it is necessary to
 come in at once or the best 21 lands will be taken up even though immigration is reporting at the
 rate of 10 000 ‘ to 15 000 a month would be proposterous there is such a vast area yet
 to be occupied but the soonei the people come the sodner they will be over their pior eeriag experience s
 and comfortably settled with their flocks grain fields and numerous neighbours with all the ‘ advantages schools post offices stores
 clvirches and other inarks of progress around them ‘ ‘ the land is there for th asking a d the
