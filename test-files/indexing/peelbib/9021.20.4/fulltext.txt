 anne b woywitka in 191 6 when the alberta and great waterways railway was being built in northeastern alberta the
 contractors were hiring men to work on the steel gang laying rails to waterways these men who were promised 15
 cents an hour were all europeans including bukowinians poles halychane and other slays among them were hnat barabash of edmonton
 who later recalled the incidents which occurred that spring and summer the contractor j d mcarthur loaded ‘ the couple
 of hundred men on a train and ‘ delivered them to a camp near waterways ‘ at the beginning of
 may a short time later when speaking to the edmonton bulletin ‘ june 14 1916 mr mcarthur said that the
 season s work would be concentrated s between mile 202 and waterways which was the terminus at mile 294 the
 men worked a ten hour day which at 1 5 cents an hour gave them 1 50 a day out
 of this sum they paid 1 00 a day for food and lodging and 1 00 a month towards a
 doctor s fee mr l 3 arabash hnat barabash of edmonton participated salu iuài 0:iuai no one evei saw tilc uocior
 uul in the 1916 strike ing the whole time they worked there on sundays and rainy days when the men
 did built this was extremely hard work as not work and were not paid the 1 00 a the men
 pushed their loaded wheelbarrows day for food and lodging was still deducted sweat poured from their bodies and it rolled
 as a result at the end of the first month down their faces into their eyes blinding they had little
 to show for their work them the mosquitoes never let up for a adding to the misery of the low
 pay moment attacking every inch of exposed were the terrible conditions with the com flesh and as if this were
 not enough the ing of warmer weather millions of mos boss and his foreman continually harrassed quitoes began to hatch
 in the swamps and the men pressing for more speed muskegs of the surrounding area these finally the men met
 one night to discuss voracious insects plagued the men at work their low wages the discomforts and the during the
 day and kept them awake at pressure for speed they decided to ask for night in addition the ground beneath
 the a 2 ½ cent an hour increase which would men s feet turned soft and soggy so that at
 least leave them a bigger margin of pay the laying of rails had to be stopped for for their back
 breaking labour if this was a time refused they would quit next morning they the nien were then transfered to
 a lift laid their demand before the boss for his gang there they were given wheelbarrows company s consideration the
 boss in turn which they had to load by hand and haul telegraphed the head office and received the gravel
 in order to raise the grade on the reply to honour the employees demands the portion of railroad which was
 already the men went back to work the author is an alberta pioneer who was born on a homestead and
 spent 43 years on a farm she moved to edmonton in 1965 where she now resides most of her information
 for this article came from mr barabash who at 83 is retired in edmonton late in june sandflies joined the
 mos ment by the company amid the unreasonably quitoes to further plague the men they low wages at last they
 agreed to demand were even worse than the mosquitoes for another 2 ½ cent increase bringing their they crawled into
 the eyes ears nose and pay to 20 cents an hour or they would mouth and burrowed into the skin
 they walk off the job came in thick swarms to draw blood and the following day they continued to their
 attacks combined with those of the work until dinner time ate their meal and mosquitoes nearly drove the men mad
 then announced that they were going on they bought straw hats with netting from strike for an increase of 2
 ½ cents an hour the company stores but they found little again the boss telegraphed the head office relief in
 edmonton but this time the deniands the days at work were bad but the were refused nights were even worse
 the men stayed the men all announced they were walkawake for hours slapping at mosquitoes ing off the job and
 asked for their time that whined all around them mr barahash sheets and pay they were told that their said
 that the insects which attacked them time sheets would be sent to edmonton day and night sapped their strength as
 much where they could go to pick up their pay as did the work so many of the men started
 out from the the men were in a quandry they need waterways camp without a penny in their ed the
 work and the few dollars it would pockets others had a few dollars on them bring them but was it
 worth it what which they could not afford to waste but should they do should they ask for another even
 so had they tried to buy bread from raise and try to stick it out or should they the company
 s stores they would have been quit it was a hard decision to make retused in the meantime trouble was
 increasing the men rolled up their blankets and between the men and the company people started for lac la biche
 175 miles away the boss and the foreman were english they walked some 20 miles before it got speaking and
 as it was war tinie feelings dark and although they were all hungry were running high scores of the men
 were they had to be content with only a drink slays who were registered as austrians on of water of
 which there was plenty the their immigration papers as such they were younger stronger men walked faster than treated as
 enemy aliens and were held in the others and continued on ahead the contempt by their employers mr barabash others
 tried to rest under the trees for a was one of these for he was a halychan while but the
 mosquitoes soon had them but was registered as an austrian who walking again cared that in his heart the slav
 disliked walking with mr barabash and his party his former rulers with as much feelings as was a man named
 berezowsky who was 55 the anglo saxon yet whenever the occas years old he had injured his leg at work
 ion arose which it did many times a day and could not walk as fast as the others the boss
 and his foreman never failed to barabash s party felt sorry for him and hurl insults at the men they
 were called slowed their pace to keep him company bloody galicians bohunks stupid next morning as they stumbled along russkys
 and every other name as they the tracks the men heard a locomotive were driven to speed up their work
 no coming towards them and they stepped asympathy was wasted on them and they side as an engine and car
 chugged along were treated more like animals than people the track the men guessed and rightly one sweltering day a
 young lad got a that it was coming to pick up the boss nose bleed and stopped work when the
 the foreman the cooks and flunkies to take boss saw him he roared to him to get hack them back
 to lac la biche now that the on the job in five minutes or get the hell men were gone
 a few hours later they out of camp men s tempers flared and the heard the same train coming back
 again feelings of dissatisfaction ran higher than so they prepared to jump on board and ride ever that night they
 held another meeting on top of the car for the rest of the way to discuss the harsh conditions their
 treat to lac la biche it was travelling slowl y 2 and when the train came abreast of them knees
 again the men saw a policeman at each end of the brothers he said this is it don t car
 they were clinging to the corner rails wait for me with one hand and held a revolver in the other
 the men protested and offered to wait until he regained his strength but he shook disregarding the police the men
 attempt his head get going there s a lot more ed to board the train anyway but were kick work
 waiting for you i m staying here i ed by the officers as they tried to get on the policemen
 were strong fellows with helped build this track and i have a right to die here heavy boots and their
 kicks landed indiscriminately on the side of the head the when the men continued to stay around face the shoulder
 or anyplace where it he half rose to his feet and shouted go would hurt one by one the men
 gave up time is running short for all of you mr then the train gathered speed and dis berezowsky lost
 consciousness again so the appeared down the track the men swearing men covered him with his blanket and cornand shaking
 their fists angrily after it their plying with his wishes they continued their feet were sore their stomachs empty and
 journey there wasn t a dry eye in that lac la biche was still many miles away compaiiy of strong
 young men as they left their comrade behind no one ever saw or mr berezowsky had been brutally kick heard
 of mr berezowsky again ed in the head as he was trying to get on the train he had fallen
 beside the track the rest of the men stumbled along the and had blacked out mr barabash and his tracks
 until late the same day by now they companions made him comfortable and were weak with hunger and wondered how
 waited until he regained consciousness one long it might take before they too might of the men brought a dripping
 hatful of fall by the way there was no relief from water and gave him a drink mr berezow the
 heat of the sun nor from the onslaught sky was shaking and his eyes were blurred of sandflies amid mosquitoes
 but the men s he complained of a pain in his head and spirits rose sharply when they spied a
 britwhen he tried to get up he sank to his ish flag hanging limply from a pole in the the
 alberta and great waterways railway was built through desolate wilderness and muskeg above is a view of the line in
 1920 distance their lagging feet picked up speed backed away leaving the men alone howand they soon arrived at a
 small log store ever their ride was a short one as a mile or so further down the track the
 train de they found the owner was a half breed railed who knew a few words of ukrainian and russian
 he told the strikers he was almost the strikers finally reached lac la out of all food supplies as the
 parties of biche on foot late thursday night they men who had preceded them had cleaned found the station door
 open so they unhim out he had nothing to offer them but rolled their blankets and retired for the recrackers
 and canned tomatoes the store mainder of the night they left early in the keeper advised them to eat slowly
 first the morning before the station master came to crackers and then some tomatoes so as not work and set
 out to look for food they to upset their stomachs after their ordeal went to the hotel and asked the
 owner of hunger they took his advice and when where they could buy food cheaply he adthey had finished eating
 they received his vised them to go to the wharf buy a large permission to lie down forar est beside
 his fish amid roast it over an open fire he gave them a tea kettle a supply of tea and
 sonic store sugar and told them to look in the gar the building was located on top of a lull
 bage dump for empty cans to use for cups where the mosquitoes were not as bad as i lue men
 pooled their resources and from in the lower areas the men covered them this they took 25 cents to buy
 a large jackselves with their blankets and quickly fell fish from a man at the wharf the fisherinto an exhausted
 sleep they slept twice man told them he would have gladly given around the clock waking up on thursday them
 the fish but he was afraid of reperafternoon feeling much refreshed they cussions he knew they were strikers and then
 finished the rest of their crackers and said if word ever got around that he had were ready to tackle
 the rest of their trek helped them by giving them free fish he to lac la biche which the storekeeper
 himself would be boycotted he said he said was still 15 miles away couldn afford to take the chance as
 he a couple of hours later they came upon had a large family to support a gravel train pulling a
 string of flatcars ofl the men made a fire on the lakeshore its way to lac la biche from the
 gravel roasted their fish and ate it they drank pits it was travelling slowly so one by their tea and
 were full for the first time one the men climbed on board the cars in many days then followed a
 swim in the rejoicing at their good fortune they placed lake to wash off the sweat and grime for their
 bed rolls under their heads and pre the first time in days they felt like human pared to rest a
 while beings but not for long the brakeman dis later that day they circulated around the covered that he had
 uninvited guests and town and learned that the jitney or rail jumped on the flatcar mr barabash the car that
 called at lac la biche with mail first one in line was kicked in tile ribs and supplies would not
 he around again and had his breath taken away he tried until thursday of next week at that time to
 rise but was unable to do so beside him none of them felt they were ready to face was a
 big bukowinetz who was built like the last 140 miles of track to edmonton in an ox he was dozing
 when tile brakeman s their condition foot caught him in the shin he jerked imuto they ate fish for supper
 again and spent a sitting position saw the brakeman illid another night in the station house but on although his
 english was limited he had no saturday morning several men overslept trouble in making himself understood and were discovered by
 the station master moy he roared one more kick amid he ordered them off company property and you re a
 dead mali when the men came back that night they found the station house locked and two he started to
 his feet amid the brakeman men guarding the place there was some glancing around at the ring of hostile faces
 talk of storming the doors and forciiig their 4 the station at lac ia niche seen here was a haven
 to the strluers br a brleb period aur ing their trek to edmonton way in but in the end they
 decided against it was still raining when they left the it instead the men picked up their bed woods the
 station house was still locked rolls and looked for a place to sleep at the so they paced the wooden
 platform back edge of the woods on the lake each man and forth to keep their blood circulating picked his
 tree rolled his blanket around and their limbs from stiffening up with the him and rested with his back against
 the wet and cold the rain let up later in the trunk but sleep was out of the question morning
 and when the sun came out it because of the mosquitoes brought a return of hope for better things next
 morning they ate fish and had it the men then returned t the lake bought again at night at the
 end of the day each another fish and ate again man went back to his tree and was pleased at
 this time a number of men decided to to find that a strong wind brought relief from walk the last
 140 miles to edmonton they the mosquitoes rolling themselves in their begged for money from the pool to buy blankets
 they were soon asleep however some bread for their trip and were given a few hours later they all awoke
 to find enough to see them through the rest all that a storm was upon them there was single men
 still had a few dollars so they thunder and lightning everywhere and large decided to await the jitney s arrival
 on trees bowed before the wind hail pelted thursday these remaining five men bought them then it started to rain
 and continued their tickets at 5 00 each and boarded the for the remainder of the night when the jitney
 to edmonton there at the company sickly dawn arrived it revealed the men office mr barabash and his friends found
 huddled like black mushrooms that were they had less than 20 00 coming to them springing out of the wet
 ground for two months of back breaking work they were cold and miserable they the alberta and great waterways railcursed
 the fates that had brought them way made no official mention of the strike there they cursed the men who
 had cx but a short time later on august 9 th w b ploited them and treated them as sub
 smith chief engineer of the railroad comhumans they had left one set of injustices plained to the edmonton bulletin that
 all in the old country for another set in can that is keeping the railroad from a speedy ada as
 their saying went from under completion through to mcmurray is a serithe eaves and out into the rain where was
 ous lack of men that was only part of justice the story mr barabash knew the rest a trip to
 the arctic circle by charles w mathers in the early days of the hudson s bay co the hundred miles
 between edmonton and the athabasca river to the north was known as the long portage the trail was the connecting
 link between the two great interior waterways the saskatchewan river and the athabasca river whose waters finally find their way
 into the arctic ocean this trail is not the best at any time and basca river among a miscellaneous colwhen
 we travelled over it in 1901 on our lection of bags boxes bales and barrels way into the arctic it
 was decidedly bad in fact everything that goes to make as there is no pullman accommodation up a fur trader
 s outfit bound for the to athabasca landing we were permitted far north to occupy the hurricane deck of a
 freight for those who have never seen a trader s wagon at other times we found walking outfit a description
 of the one with which the only means of transportation good we journeyed for the first seven hundred and in
 due time reached the landing a niiles of our trip may be interesting the few days later we were afloat
 on the atha scows numbered four and were all after mr mathers was a pioneer edmonton photographer who made a
 trip to the arctic in 1901 this article was written specially for the farmers advocate of winnipeg and was published
 in their dec 21 1903 issue the illustrations are all photos by mathers taken during the trip in 1904 he
 sold his studio and collection to ernest brown and the negatives now are part of the ernest brown collection provincial
 museum and archives edmonton the photo above is a mathers view of dog rib indians on great slave lake 6
 the same pattern being about fifty feet long blanket and having selected a spot most twelve feet wide and four
 feet deep each suited to his fancy as a resting place went boat s crew consisted of seven indians one
 to sleep the indians always lit a fire and of whom acted as guide or steersman and hi hi ed
 around it for considerable time handled the ponderous sweep one was after which they rolled in their blankets bowsman and
 the five others were oars and went to sleep with their feet to the fire men whose duty it also
 was to pack the preparing the grub for the crew of 24 goods across the portages each scow car indians
 was no sinecure a stove with a ned about i 80 pieces each piece represent length or two of pipe
 was set up on a ing 100 pounds on an average all the raised platform in one end of the
 boat for goods for the north are put up in hundred the accommodation of the cook here he pound lots
 or as near that quantity as held despotic sway and woe betide the possible so that they may be the
 more indian whn came to touch that stove in easily packed on the portages all sorts of weather the process
 of making the first thing in the boat was a tier bannock had to proceed we saw the cook or
 two of bags of flour extending from in a pelting rain standing on a side of bacon bow to stern
 then came sides of bacon with a slicker coat and a sou wester on sacks of rice caddies of tobacco
 bags of busy mixing up the flour for his bannock shot and bags of balls boxes of rifles boxes bacon
 beans bannock and tea made up of raisins crates of hardware pails of cand the usual bill of fare there
 was no trouble les stoves medicine chests kegs of powder in serving dinner everybody helped himbales of twine for net
 making blankets self out of the identical dishes in which the ready made clothing dress goods tea etc things were
 cooked all piled in without much order the only the boats were all tied together and care exercised in their
 placing being to see when meat sue was called there followed that the boat rides level a lively scramble by
 the crew over bales so downstream we drifted only stopping and boxes as if the very existence of each when
 night overtook us then the boats depended on his getting there first i have were snubbed to a tree each
 man took his seen hungry people eat but these indians this mathers view shows traders boats on slave river in
 1901 7 beat all previous records dippers of beans great chunks of bannock and bacon and ‘ s cups of
 tea strong enough to float a wedge disappeared apparently without an effort for the first few days i thought they
 would ‘ never get filled up but gradually they became satisfied ‘ a hundred and twenty miles from the landing
 we passed through pelican rapids and saw the place where the government q had sunk a shaft in the hope
 of striking oil but struck gas instead it was escaping in great quantities with such a l orce that one
 could hear it for almost a mile it was on ‘ fire then with a flanie jumping 25 or 30
 feet into the air a hundred and forty five miles further ‘ brought us to grand rapids the most ‘
 dangerous rapid on the athabasca river ‘ and the first of a series of almost continuous rapids for 87 miles
 everything hail to be the author was amazed at the strength of taken out of the scows amid packed about
 the packers loads from 100 to 200 pounds half a mile over the island the boats then were not uncommon
 he caught this view empty run down the channel to the right of the indians at work on a portage
 at the left side is the main channel through which it is utterly impossible for a scow mile away instantly
 everybody was alert to go in safety the packing of the goods the only two rifles in the boat were
 made across this portage was really the first work ready and amid a deathly silence save for i saw the
 indians do and the loads they the swish of the sweep we were guided carried were truly astonishing they have
 nearer to shore as we drifted nearer the a strap about eight feet long which they moose were both broadside
 to us facing use for packing purposes the two ends of each other and about 100 yards away when the
 strap are tied to the articles to be trans crack went the rifles ported it is then raised well up
 onto his we would have drawn the curtain on the shoulders with the broad centre part of scene just there
 hut the events which folthe strap resting across the upper part of lowed impressed us so deeply we could hot
 his forehead they carried loads all the before the animals were half skinned two way from 100 to 200 pounds
 and on the of the indians were eating a kidney apiece shorter portages much more than that for the way
 the carcasses were cut up and example i saw one of them packing an mauled around was shocking we saw
 an ordinary no 8 cook stove and another indian trying to get a considerable piece a small skinny individual walking
 off of the paunch ifltd the hip pocket of his with a barrel of sugar blue overalls we camped early
 that night the run through the rest of the rapids for the indian has a weakness for moose was most
 exciting and delightful some meat and while any remains he feels it his times rushing along at fifteen miles an
 hour duty to continue eating notwithstanding sweeping around bends shooting little falls that a lot had been boiled and more
 frie 1 riding over heavy swells where everything for supper they kept the fires burning all creaked and rattled as
 the scow plunged night roasting and ate moose and heat and tossed in the heavy waves their tom toms until
 nearly daybreak next just before the last two rapids were run morning sunday a few came for breakfast i saw
 one of the finest sights of my whole two or three for dinner but none for suptrip as we drifted
 around one of the many per monday morning when we were ready bends two moose were sighted almost a to
 go there was no moose left execpt the 8 hide and a small piece our cook cached a fur trader
 of that place we went up slave even the bones were cracked and the mar river to the mouth of
 the peace row extracted this part of slave river from chipewyan we soon reached fort mcmurray 350 to where the
 peace flows into it is somemiles from edmonton after successfully what erratic in its movements one time passing all the
 rapids on the athabasca and you may find it flowing into the lake as the boat hands except one were
 all paid we did and the next flowing the other way off the h b co s steamer grahaiii its
 movements are controlled by the height comes up as far as this point and down as of the water in
 the lake once at the mouth far as smith s landing where the rapids of the peace river we made
 a quick run on slave river begin there is every mdi down the slave as far as smith landing cation
 of immense tar deposits at fort mc here we were confronted by twenty five murray the odor of tar is
 quite noticeable miles of very heavy rapids and a crew of as one drifts down the river the mud of
 chipewyan indians had to be engaged as the cutbank is quite dark and smells strong guides and packers the h
 b co and ly of tar and will burn with a little coaxing some of the free traders have oxen
 carts the next 200 miles to fort chipewyan to convey the goods overland to fort smith we drifted leisurely down
 interesting as it a distance of sixteen miles instead of the is space will not permit a further descrip laborious
 work of going by the river by tion of our journey down the athabasca which way there are four distinct
 portages where all the bends or points are so much to be made in the twenty five miles at alike
 that you cannot tell one from the each of which every bag and box had to other and all so
 beautiful despite their un be packed and the boats hauled overland var ing sameness that you can look at them
 the smith rapids as they are called are day after day without tiring after leaving simply magnificent but the main
 part of the athahasca river the west end of the the river about two miles wide is alto athiabasca 1
 ake had to be crossed for a gether too dangerous for boats to go down distai ice of about twelve
 miles before reach they are therefore run through the numing fort chipewyan froin which with the ercus small channels on
 the east side of assistance of a small steamer belonging to the main stream the run to the point ‘
 l fort chipewyan was built on solid rock as seen by this view of the catholic mission in 1901 skillful
 boatmen guide their craft through the rapids at the second portage on slave river where we had to niake the
 first portage a scrap and usually celebrate the arrival of was very exciting some places there was a newcomer by
 a general fight no more than room for the boats the over they will steal anything from a pair of
 hanging boughs almost touched our heads boots to a side of bacon we could never as we raced along switching
 around bends leave the boats for five minutes not even and jumping little waterfalls the guides if there was no
 dog in sight for as sure as were all a qui vive keeping their boa s we did something would
 be missing at in the right course and avoiding the rocks fort smith before we got things secure that threaten
 to block up the channel en from their encroachments they ate a side t rely it took us just six
 days to make the of bacon ten pounds of cheese two large twenty five miles 1 found myself then at
 sacks of oatmeal and even got away with fort smith from whence the h b co s some flour one
 day when we were ready steamer wrigley runs into the arctic to launch a boat but away to dinner they
 ocean making a round trip of twenty six licked the grease from the ways and ate hundred miles once in
 every year taking a up two pounds of putty we have seen supply of goods and bringing back furs them
 stand in the water by the hour trying a few miles from smith the salt sup to catch a fish
 and quite often they were plied for the whole north is obtained it is successful of a fine coarse quality
 so plentiful that it from fort smith we took passage with can be shovelled up by the bagful not far
 another trader as far as fort resolution also from smith roam a small herd of the on great slave lake
 here we saw the dog once plentiful buffalo rib and yellow knife indians coming in heretofore i have said nothing
 about off the lake with their winter catch of fur the dogs but it was not for lack of dogs
 when they came within sight of the fort at every post and with every indian you the first thing they
 did was to salute by firwill find them they are the people s horses ing off their rifles keeping up
 quite a fus in the winter when they are used princi ilade until they got quite close to shore pally
 they are fed little or nothing and in after they land and get up their skin lodges the summer scarcely
 enough to keep their their next move is to visit the trading post two sides apart they are all prone
 never and get what is called their arrival it theless to enjoy what is commonly called usually consists of a
 small quantity of such 10 tattered dogrib indian boys greeted the traders on their northern expedition articles as flour tea
 raisins sugar etc bear or two several rats half a dozen with probably tobacco and matches added marten a fisher
 and an otter or two prob they may however have nothing to put ably a white fox or a blue
 one three or them in in which case they take the hand four skunks and a wolverine or two kerchief
 off their head and in the absence after the sorting and counting is done of that one usually a variegated
 silk one is the trader hands the indian two pieces of bought otherwise a long narrow small cotton bag made
 for the purpose is se paper on one is marked the value of the cured first he may get a
 skin of flour fur and on the other the amount of his which means only a cupful that is put
 in gratuity it seems a very absurd mode of trading i give you so niuch for your furs and a
 piece of shaginappi tied around a skin of tea niay follow and another cord and so much for nothing the
 gratuity is the skin of raisins and one of sugar are always traded out first put in together and another
 tie then niay nothing is ever papered up such articles come a skin of currants and a skin of rice
 as brown paper and cord are unknown so finally when the bag is full it looks like an when the
 indian comes to do his chief buyovergrown sausage ing he and his wife with the interpreter are the next day
 he returns and talks about the only ones admitted into the store the his fur and the price the scarcity
 of game door is locked they walk around and look his dogs and how many miles they can at everything
 pointing out what they want travel in a day in fact there is little else and indicating the quantity by
 so many you can talk to them about and even that skins each article as it is chosen is has
 to be done through an interpreter three thrown in a pile on the floor after their or four days are
 taken up in this way as limit is reached they gather all up in their if he were reluctant to
 part with his much arms and are let out when their trading prized peltries to him this is the one
 event is done they usually stop around a few days of the year finally the pack is brought in and
 by that time most of the luxuries are and thrown on the floor the trader very de eaten up then
 they live on fish with the hiberately opens and sorts the fur he may only variation that when they don
 t have it have a few red fox one cross fox four or fresh they have it dried five beaver
 one or two muskox or a black we took the h b co s steamer from ii these views show

 of the trip north a one garden truck growing and doing just as hundred mile run brought us to the
 mac well as any you would see in edmonton kenzie river an immense stream one even though this point is
 1 200 niiles furthousand miles long and from two to three ther north even as far as the arctic circle
 miles wide unceasing vigilance is the price the missionaries and attaches of the h b that has to be paid
 for its safe navigation co grow their own potatoes channels that the steamer followed last the banks of the mackenzie
 for its enyear may be closed this year sand bars tire length are densely wooded with spruce suddenly appear where
 formerly the main and willow sonic of the spruce would channel ran just before entering the mac square eight inches
 for seventy five feet kenzie we spent a few hours at the english of course there are valleys miles in
 extent church mission at hay river there we saw where raiik grass grows in abundance where a most beautiful and
 well kept garden the fire has destroyed the timber the royal growing everything in the flower and vege golden rod
 fireweed and raspberries grow table line in profusion but in the whole north to shortly after entering the mackenzie any
 lover of nature there is no spot so river we passed fort providence where i interesting as the ramparts two
 great saw a fine crop of barley growing next we stretches of perpendicular sandstone rock came to fort sinipson the
 chief post for 180 to 300 feet high bound the river on the whole north there we saw several either
 side thereby forcing the river into things that surprised us considerably the the channel of only one third its usual
 first was to see an electric light plant used width yet there is no quickening of the for lighting up

 a man called on the mystified grocer and laid bare all the facts as he was conversant with them haviig

 years following 1877 it was customary around october for camp groups consisting of two or three household units to head
 out into the bush on foot accompanied by pack horses they caiiiped in the bush in tents or tipi like
 shelters of saplings chinked with mud through the late fall winter and spring and then moved back to the lac
