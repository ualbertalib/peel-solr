 newbolt as told to angus mekinnon i was born at woolwich barracks in england in the kyber pass after which
 he was invalided on august 31 1866 where my father was an home to england from 1877 to 1880 he
 was officer in the royal horse artillery and was liv the governor of the isle of st helena but he
 had ing in residence at this barracks he saw service with the british army in many parts of the world
 in 1951 pioneer rancher angus mckinnon interviewed his neighbour w r ‘ bob newbolt who and like many other army
 personnel he was owned the bowchase ranch some 15 miles southseldom posted in one place long enough to have east
 of calgary on the bow river when he had his family with him therefore i spent the transcribed his notes
 mckinnon noted that ‘ it is greater part of my boyhood days at uppingham mr mrs newbolt s desire that
 this stor y should not be nublished during their life time accordingly boys school in england i had two sisters
 who the manuscnpt was placed in the glenbow archives also had to remain in england while a great deal in
 the hope that in the future it could be rewritten of the time my mother accompanied father to the for
 historical purposes as mr newbolt passed away various places where he was posted in 1956 and his wife three years
 later an edited ver my father was in india at the time of the indian sion of the interview now
 is presented here above is a view of the bowchase ranch about 1886 mutiny and was severely wounded while fighting
 to relinquish this post due to his old battle alex who were on their way to the lenthi wounds he
 was then sent to dresden germany valley in idaho to take delivery of 3 000 head for some special treatment
 this was the first time of cattle these had been purchased and assemit was possible for all the family to
 be together bled and would be ready for delivery upon receipt the next two years in dresden were the only
 time of the necessary payment on account of 33 000 i ever had with my father to my great disappointment
 i was forbidden the advantage of going to live in germany was to take along my much prized english riding
 outthat it gave me an opportunity to study the fit and was persuaded to dispose of the whole language it
 was my father s ambition that his bally lot to a riding academy for less than half only son should
 embark on a military career and of what it had cost me in england in order to gain a commission
 it was necessary i travelled by train and overtook the other to learn at least one foreign language shareholders at
 deer lodge montana on the in due course i had to take my first medical northern pacific railmad they were
 waiting for examination for the service and to my father s the departure of the stagecoach from red rock great
 disappointment i did not pass this was a short distance from deer lodge to the lemhi due to varicose veins
 in my legs which were the valley result of a severe strain during a sculling contest rogers was head of
 the party and he carried when my team was being stressed to the limit a draft on the first national
 bank of the u s a about this time my father read an advertise which on arrival at our destination
 he tendered ment in the london times inserted by a former to the owner of the cattle the cattleman handed
 brother officer in the royal horse artillery it back to rogers and told him to make cigarette general t bland
 strange the general was papers out of it for all he cared he would not advertising for men of means
 and good character accept it nor would he release the cattle to us to join with him in a colonization
 project in the until he had the cold cash in his hand north west territories as i was not going
 into we then had to return by stagecoach to deer the service my father encouraged me to take a lodge
 send he draft back to kingston where share in this company and go to canada the general had to make
 arrangements for the i left my family in germany in 1884 when i necessary currency to be expressed from new
 was 18 years old and was never to see my father york by the wells fargo bankers this took again
 he passed away soon after that time from about three weeks time during which we were the effects of his
 wounds and was buried in staying at the burnett house in deer lodge dresden my financial condition was such that
 i was not when general strange organized the military able to pay the necessary 2 00 per day for food
 colonization company the mcc he made and lodgings so i worked for a few days at 1 00 it a
 condition that to become a shareholder one per day and my keep mopping out the saloon was required to pay
 1 000 in cash with the then i got a few trips as a dining car waiter on privilege of
 working for the company at 50 a the passenger train out of deer lodge this also month in addition if
 a shareholder desired he at 1 00 per day plus board could take a homestead on land adjacent to the
 most of the dining car patrons were gold lease and start in ranching for himself miners or mine operators and
 it was the custom before leaving for canada i outfitted myself for them to carry a poke of gold dust
 to be with a complete english riding regalia and equip used as currency the usual payment for a meal ment
 right down to the last detail in style and on the diner was a pinch from the poke this of
 the best quality i booked passage on the being as much gold dust as the waiter could take parisian the
 flagship of the allen line and sailed from the poke with his thumb and first finger for quebec city i
 disembarked there and con the old dining car conducter encouraged the tinued by train to kingston where it had been
 waiters to let their nails grow long so as to get arranged that i would meet general strange on the
 greatest possible amount of gold dust at each my arrival i found that the general had plans pinch from the
 poke already made for my future which of course during the time while we were waiting for the appealed to
 my adventurous spirit i was to con money to arrive by express news leaked out that tinue immediately on my
 journey to the west to we would be travelling by stage coach with this overtake a party of mcc shareholders
 s s large amount of money and rumours of plans by rogers jim reid and one of the general s
 sons outlaws to hold up the stage were in the air in 2 tom lynch often went on ahead of
 the herd purchasing supplies and making all other necessary arrangements a young nephew of his was one of the night
 herders on several occa sions i came on to him sound asleep using his saddle for a pillow and with
 his horse safely picketed nearby when i complained to the wagon boss about this i was told the next time
 i found young lynch asleep while he was sup posed to be on duty i was to quietly unpicket his
 horse and lead it back to camp this oppor ‘ tunity of course soon when he amved iyi back at
 camp at daybreak after cariying his sad die a couple of miles and found his horse tied to the wagon
 he was fairly in a rage when he learned how it had got there he was going to murder that
 bloody englishman conse • quently from that time on when he was on night duty they would not allow me
 to be away from the camp we trailed from idaho through the lemhi pass into montana by way of butte
 on to deer lodge helena augusta and across the black bob ne tholt looked like a dapper 3 oung englishman
 feet indian reservation the indians were when he arrived in canada in 1884 his beloved derby anything but friendly and
 we had to give them was later used for target practise by western cowboys several steers from the henj even
 then only with fact the stage was held up in prickly pear can the assistance of a troop of u
 s cavaly were yon but we were not on board we had outwitted we allowed to proceed across their territory
 the bandits by dividing the money among the four so far on this trailing and night herding i was of
 us hiding out for a few days and leaving at dressed in my english clothing flannels puttees different times each
 one travelling alone i had bowler hat and all these garments were far from made up mind that in case
 of a hold up i would suitable for such use so i outfitted myself at deer say to hell with
 the bully money and my hands lodge with a complete western cowboy outfit would go up fast and high excepting
 only a six shooter something i we finally all arrived back in idaho and soon never did carry or use
 after acquiring this new handed the cold cash to the cattleman who outfit which of course included a cowboy hat
 immediately turned the herd over to us i put my beloved bowler in the wagon where i tom lynch an
 experienced professional cat thought it would be safe but the riders found it tle trailer had previously contracted to take
 this and soon riddled it with bullets herd to canada for the mcc so we fell in with whenever i
 was allowed to ride i had at my his riders but stayed on the mcc payroll i was disposal a
 quiet old white horse the only one put in charge of the money which we kept for considered to be
 safe enough for such a the purpose of paying all necessary expenses greenhorn to ride i had of course ridden
 on which would be incurred en route they also put many occasions as a boy in england i had even
 me driving one of the wagons during the daytime ridden to the hounds so at ever y opportunity and i
 carried the bank roll in the jockey box when i was out of sight of the others i trained on
 the front of the wagon box because i was my old white horse to jump anything we came a greenhorn
 of course they took all sorts of to one day along the trail we were passing a advantages of me
 along with driving the wagon homesteader place when some of the cattle got all day i was put night herding
 and all night through this fellow s rail fence into his field at that i did not catch on for
 quite a while that some of our riders started to tear down a section the other riders were being relieved
 at midnight of this rail fence to go after the cattle i told them because meeting them in the dark
 i would not not to do that my horse could jump the fence know the difference i gave him a
 run and he cleared it nicely i fol 3 lowed the cattle till we came to a gate to let
 them of the mcc out i finally found the place and the general impa the boss had seen this performance
 and he said tiently waiting for news of his herd after getthat any fellow who could jump a horse that
 way ting orders from him i returned to the herd and could ride a bronco they saddled one up for
 me directed it to the ranch by following the estaband helped me on of course i was soon bucked lished
 cattle trail from the south country which off this happened three times then a mexican was used when trailing cattle
 for shipping at showed me how to hobble my stirrups and also strathmore to hold one rein tighter than the
 other to keep the the water was quite high where we crossed horse bucking in a circle then i rode
 the bron the bow we had no trouble with the herd but co to a stand still had considerable difficulty
 in crossing the one night when we were camped near a town wagons and equipment most of the provisions we
 all rode in to spend the evening leaving only which might be damaged by water were carried a couple of
 riders with the herd after the boys by the riders holding them above their heads had several drinks i hated
 the bally stuff and while their hor ses swam across the wagons had couldn t drink it they proceeded to
 shoot up the to be dismantled and floated over a piece at a saloon i never knew till then what
 a good place time the wagon boxes gave us the most trouble there was to hide under a billiard table
 i ducked and getting them over was accomplished by takunder there from the flying bullets and i stayed ing them
 apart and pulling them over a piece at till the smoke was all cleared away a time with the saddle
 horses the next day we were overtaken on the trail we finally arrived at the ranch in the late sumby
 the sheriff who proceeded to arrest the whole mer where the general counted the cattle as he bally lot of
 us we were not allowed to continue perched on top of a post as they passed through on our way
 until i had counted out to him from the gate the jockey box a sufficient amount of money to i
 soon began to realize the reason for the pay for all the damage done to the saloon this general s
 enthusiasm about the possibilities of amounted to 25 apiece for each man who had colonizing the lease which he had
 acquired from been in town myself included disregarding the the canadian government the territory where fact that i had taken
 refuge under the billiard table he planned to carry on operations was a beautiful during the shooting expanse of rolling
 and level prairie bounded on i was developing into a pretty fair cowhand and the south by the bow river
 and on the north by the boys were beginning to treat me with a good the cpr main line extending
 from the west deal more respect than was the case at the start boundary of the blackfoot indian reserve right
 of the trip i was enjoying the experience up to the city of calgary the three townships immensely and had
 developed a love for the great which he had leased were located a short distance wide open spaces out from
 the bow river it was slow travelling with the herd as it was this whole area was covered with a
 heavy necessary to allow the cattle sufficient time to growth of lush prairie grass there were feed along the way
 in any case we were in no numerous sloughs and small lakes as well as hurry as we had the
 whole summer ahead of us several small creeks spread over this range with we finally reached the united states border
 and the shelter along the banks it was a paradise for crossed into the north west territory on the 1
 g livestock this abundance of water was also a baker bull trail paradise for the thousands of water fowl and
 on our arrival at fort macleod we were held upland game birds which inhabited this vast up for severa l
 days while the herd was counted natural prairie to the west were the rolling and otherwise thoroughly checked over by
 the foothills covered with bush and timber back of north west mounted police soon after we pro which towered the
 snow covered peaks of the ceeded on north and i was sent ahead to locate rocky mountains the mcc home
 ranch where the general would this was an exciting adventure for a young be awaiting our arrival not one of
 our crew greenhorn englishman to be so suddenly transknew where the ranch was located so conse planted from life in
 the old lands to those great quently i went directly to calgar y for informa wide open spaces i was
 full of energy and ambition it was many miles more than would have tion so i soon explored the whole
 territory been the case had we known the exact location selected a spot along the river and proceeded to 4
 build a home in preparation for going into the to take delivery of 500 head of cattle carrying ranching business
 myself i took up a homestead the h brand after trail branding these cattle we and pre emption the homestead
 was a full headed with them to the home ranch following quarter section the pre emption was partly cut the
 regular route we crossed the bow in the off by the river i immediately went to work and same place
 as in the previous year and again before winter set in i had completed a small log experienced considerable difficulty
 with the cabin and a horse stable purchased 10 head of wagons and equipment cattle from the mcc and became
 a full fledged this was a good herd of cattle and cost the rancher i chose for my brand the
 dio and that mcc about 30 per head i was able to acquire was the name by which my outfit
 was known soofthesegoodcowstoincreasemyownherd i continued to work for the mcc for a while i immediately proceeded to fence my land
 also but they were cutting the previously arranged completing my buildings and corrals in order to monthly wages from 50
 to 30 per month as be proving up on my homestead and pre emption a result some of the other
 shareholders were tak during the summer word reached me that my ing homesteads and also going into ranching for father
 had passed away in germany a nd also that themselves my mother and two sisters were coming to arthur goldfinch
 an englishman and also a canada to live with me on my ranch i was of shareholder had established himself
 on the river course delighted to have them come sol immeabout five miles above the mcc home ranch diately made
 plans and proceeded to erect he had acquired a considerable sized herd of cat suitable additions to my house to
 accommodate tle and used the horse track as his brand i worked not only my mother and sisters but also
 the with him for a few weeks and gained some good housemaids whom they informed me would be experience in
 how to handle livestock accompanying them i put in most of the first winter working for i was on hand
 to meet them upon their arrival the mcc at the home ranch i was also able to during october in
 calgary where i had arranged look after my own few head of stock as well as for suitable living quarters
 for them while i cornspend some time improving my property and in pleted the accommodations at home it was only
 general not neglecting my own interests in the by strenuous efforts that i had everything shipspring of 1885 i went
 as a rider with the mcc shape and ready for them to come out to my r anch wagon to
 the chipman ranch at pincher creek in time to spend christmas 1 ‘ ji • • c f i ‘
 i 1 f t the bow chase ranch seen aho w as nestled in a valie the bow rh er
 east of calgary the main ranch house contained the original homestead shack with numerous additions 5 this was certainly a
 happy occasion in my life was very dry and the crop was a complete failure dimmed of course by the
 fact that my father was determined not to have this happen a second not present i am sure if he
 had lived to see my time i engaged a surveyor and he found we could surroundings his disappointment in my
 failing to bring water from a short distance up the river by measure up for a military career would have
 been digging a ditch a distance of perhaps a half a lessened mile i let a contract for this work
 the contractor because of the established fact that my father s arrived with about 20 men and 40 horses moved
 death had been the direct result of his battle right in and ate up everything we had on the bully
 wounds he was classed by the army as having ranch while digging the ditch the next spring been killed in
 action therefore each member the raging river proceeded to change its course of his family was entitled to the usual
 pension and consequently ruined my irrigation plans my share of this was issued only for a few however during the
 many years which followed months and i never did accept any of it as i imme there was ample rainfall
 and my fertile river botdiately signed it over to my mother tom land did not need irrigating the ditch was
 my mother stayed on the ranch with me until never used and a few grassed over scars can still 1891
 when she returned to england these years be seen after all these years while she was here were certainly pleasant
 ones another mcc shareholder by the name of in my life she was happy and contented and took pruin had
 homesteaded on the next quarter up a great interest in the ranch operations she was the river from me when
 i fenced my property especially fond of the tree covered flat below the i got permission from him to take
 in a small porranch house along the river it reminded her of tion of his land perhaps about 15 acres
 in order similar scenes in england often referred to as a to have a suitable watering place for my stock
 chase she added the name of the river at the river several years later the canadian coal bow to the
 former making one word and colonization company purchased pruin s bowchase and from that time on my place was homestead
 and when the founder of that cornknown as bowchase ranch pany sir john lister kaye came to inspect his in
 the spring of 1886 i broke a few acres of newly acquired land he asked me about this prairie sod
 on top of the hill on my homestead fence and why it was out of line and on his propquarter
 and seeded it to oats i had no seeder so erty when i explained to him that i had perthe
 work was done by hand my man drove the mission from my previous neighbour for that team on the wagon
 while i rode in the box and watering privilege sir john very kindly gave me scattered the seed broadcast we
 then cut a huge permission to continue to occupy the small piece bunch of willow brush and dragged this over
 the of land ground with the team to cover up the seed there years later when the curtis people bought
 the was ample rain and the virgin soil produced a adjoining ranch including the old pruin splendid crop we had
 no harvesting machinery homestead they immediately pr oceeded to build so the crop was cut with the mowing machine a
 new fence right on the line i protested but raked up and hauled to one of the corrals where they
 would not listen to me so i served them with we placed it on the ground turned in a bunch
 a court injunction which stopped them in their of horses and put in a man with a whip to keep
 tracks my claim was by gift from sir john lister them on the move to trample out the grain we
 kaye and also by squatter s rights legal by had to put bridles on these horses and tie up their
 right of 25 years of continuous possession the heads otherwise they would have eaten up the curtis people engaged r
 b bennett to assist whole bully works after the trampling was corn them in gaining possession of my property he
 pleted we gathered up the threshed out grain and told them they hadn t a chance as i had the
 right threw it up in the air during a high wind to blow to the property regardless of any title
 so long as out the chaff we ended up with a nice quantity i had possession of it the posts
 the curtis people of oats to feed our horses on the long trips to put in remained there for years
 just as they were calgary and also for the hard rides on the range when i stopped them with my
 court injunction i did not extend my cropping very much in years later i allowed another owner to use part
 those years due to the inconveniences of of this land in order to get a level location for harvesting without
 the proper equipment i did a corner post while rebuilding his fences however break up a few acres of good
 fertile during the years while my mother was with river bottom and the first year i put it into crop
 me on the ranch my operations had been reall y 6 this is a view of bob newbolt s cattle
 herd on the bow river flats during the happy days before the country was broken up by farmers cessful i
 had continually incr eased my herd of frazer and on the first day of june 1899 we wer e cattle
 which were practically all white faces and married in calgary by the right reverend bishop i was using good white
 faced bulls i had also c w pinkham mabel promised me then that she started into the horse business and
 had some good would remain at bowchase for five years after hackney blooded horses these were in demand which time
 i was to go with her wherever she by the government for both the militia and the chose to go
 mounted police i had increased my ranch i had expanded my farming operations some holdings had several sections of deeded
 land as in these years in 1900 1 went to an auction sale well as some prairie lease all fenced
 so i was at namaka and bought a binder with which to able to put up plenty of hay for
 winter feeding cut my crop my first real threshing was done whenever it was necessary in 1901 when some people
 came across the river after my mother s departure i continued on in the winter with their horse power outfit
 to do at the ranch living a normal bachelor rancher s my threshing they were able to do about 100
 life at times i had a cook and other times car bushels a day and had some young indians from
 ried on by batching my ranch became a regular dunbow school to help feed the mill and stack rendezvous for
 my friends and neighbours and he straw my farming was pr oviding lots of good they spent many happy times
 with me oats to feed our horses as we were showing some my ranching operations were proving to be of
 them at the calgary exhibition the work ver y successful and i had developed into a top these horses were
 doing in the field was ver y notch rancher i could ride and rope with any of useful towards breaking
 them it took real them could hold my own in a poker game and horsemen to handle these blooded animals
 even had acquired a special liking for good whiskey then they often ran away and busted up the bally i
 spent a good deal of my spare time in calgary machinery playing footba ll and polo i was a charter
 member i made a little extra money with my binder cutof the ranchmen s club and at one time when
 ting for some of the neighbours at 75 cents per the club was in financial difficulties i a long with
 acre when i took one of these jobs it always a few others rescued it from the hands of the
 interfered with my usual business as i could not sheriff trust anyone else with the binder therefore i one of
 my sisters married oswald critchley would have to run it myself and they had two small sons a lady by
 the name before the five year period had expir ed mabel of mabel frazer came out from ontario and mr
 was more in love with bowchase and its beautiful critchley had persuaded her to take a position surroundings than she
 seemed to be with her bally as governess for his two sons this duty was for husband except for a
 trip to england and few a trial period of six months then if both parties trips to the pacific coast
 we continued to live were satisfied the position was to become at bowchase through all the years we had a
 permanent house built in calgar y which we used on occa it was at the critchley home where i met
 mabel sions when we were visiting the city we spent 7 i i mabel newbolt is seen feeding the chickens
 at bowchase ranch after their leased land was taken b homesteaders the new bolts raised hogs and chickens on their
 small spread a few winters in calgary and also considerable things v ere going along pretty well hut there time
 during the e hihitions when we were show seemed to he signs of new settlers settling on the ing our
 hackney blooded horses prairie building fences plowing up the sod and mabel s love for good horses resulted in her
 in many instances interfering with m horses and persuading me to purchase the beautiful imported cattle running on the range
 hackney stallion romance this act was to be the other ranchers seemed to he accepting this the means of providing
 us with plenty of intrusion but i resented this interference by those romance in the years ahead this stallion s
 off hlighters along about this time i made a bully spring won many valuable prizes in both riding blunder when
 i purchased a motor car it was a and driving classes at the calgary exhibition in grey coloured buick and
 cost me si 700 1 got those glamorous days prior to world war one on with it fairly well but
 it sure got me into plenty in battles in foreign lands during that war of trouble these hally farmers were
 fencing up romance s offspring played no small part arid my trails so i often charged right into those fences
 many of them lost their i es and vent right on my way even when they built we spent a
 good deal of our time breaking and a gate most times it was so tight that i could not training
 these horses br ihe exhibition that open it so often i had to dri e right into it and training
 was fbi all made use of in the ring as bust the hally thing down the farmers left what at
 roundup time i could mount ms men on horses they called road allow ances hut the niany sloughs second to
 no other i ancher s riding string when and mud holes would not allow my motor car the neighbouring ranches
 threw in to help each 10 stay in a straight hue i could tra el only if other at branding
 and spe trig time il was bob i could go around the sloughs hut this was pos newbolt and old
 slippery the two of us could sible on on open prairie catch more hind legs than any other man in
 the mrs newbolt soon learned to take along her roping crew tatting or knitting when we went in the motor
 car 8 so she would have something to occupy her time while i walked miles to get someone to pull
 us out of a mud hole due to the fact that i was not on ver y friendly terms with
 most of the farmers they often politely told me to go to hell and stay stuck for all they cared
 i could do no damage with my motor car while it was safe in a mud hole even with the
 interference of farmers on my range things were going along pretty good we were selling a number of beef each
 year and also some horses at good pr ices i used the proceeds from these sales to completely rebuild and
 modernize our ranch house this work included several additional rooms but we still retained the original part which i built
 in 1884 to be used as a second kitchen where the ranch hands mea ls were prepared by 1917 i
 was farming in a big way and was gr owing some excellent cr ops but it was difficult to get
 any one of my neighbours to do my threshing none of them liked me very well and besides they had
 plenty of their own to do finally i went to calgar y to buy a thresher of my own i
 putthased a separator but the salesman told me i didn t need an engine i could thresh bob and mabel
 newbolt centre were active in the britishwith my motor car i had purchased a new motor dominated social community in
 calgary and in the surcar hut still had the original gray buick rounding ranching area their tives centred around i
 engaged some experts and followed their ad horses cattle and their fellow britishers vice and instructions we put pulleys on
 the hind in her as the frost had busted the old ones wheels of my old motor car and with
 an arrange the bully farmers continued to move in and ment of timbers shafts wheels and belts attemp by this
 time my range was practically all fenced ted to thresh the crop these experts seemed to up and my relations
 with my neighbour s were require all these parts only one piece at a time not too good i had
 to reduce my herds of both from calgary and kept me busy running back and cattle and horses also to
 depend more on my forth farming operations for feed for my livestock it soon became obvious that this outfit just
 i could not get much help or advice from my didn t seem to be any good meanwhile time neighbours
 and had to learn the lessons in conwas passing and my crop was still in the field nection with modern
 farming by myself i raised i finally lost my patience fired the bally blunder some good crops but was reluctant
 to break up ing experts discarded this worthless contraption my beloved sections of prairie land and hastened into calgary where
 i purchased a in the fall of 1923 while i was running my two lunger tractor we got the tractor
 home then separator i met with a terrible accident which i soon had my crop all threshed was nearly the
 end of my life i got my shirt i also purchased a tr actor plow and proceeded sleeve caught between
 a belt and a pulley while to do some fall plowing i was a real farmer now oiling a bearing
 and had my left arm wound all my neighbors were out making dust why several times around the pulley almost
 pulling shouldn i be making dust too it off i was weeks in hospital and never did when the weather
 turned cold that fall i left regain the full use of the arm my tractor on top of the hill
 and did not drain this accident was a great setback for a long the water out of it at first
 i thought i should go time i was not able to do anything myself and and drain it then i
 decided i would just let her was not able to get competent help by this time go to hell i
 d have to overhaul her in the spring my open range was all fenced up and my own anyway i
 sure did i had to put a new set of lungs fenced sections had become badly overgrazed 9 i had
 no choice but to send my horses and cattle the past a few year s ago some of our old
 many miles to pasture these animals had been neighbours pooled their efforts and installed a raised on the ranch and
 were used to their familiar telephone giving us communication with our range so when they were taken to strange places
 nearest neighbour this has been a great comfort they immediately tried to return home th is and satisfaction to us
 especially during the long resulted in many of them going astray and the winter months when we know that in
 case of blighters who had stolen my range continued to trouble or sickness we can call for help chase and
 steal my stock at last i was forced as i look back over the 66 years which i have to
 dispose of what remained of them spent at bowchase they have been full of inter i finally got rid of
 all my land excepting my esting experiences and i have made my mistakes homestead and pre emption mrs newbolt and
 like everyone else one of my happiest memories i then started into the hog business and stayed is to think
 back into the past of these great with it continuously regardless of markets or beautiful open spaces as they were
 befor e being prices it proved to be a reliable source of income marred and scarred by the forward march
 of as well as something to occupy our time civilization now mabel and i are spending the declining i suppose
 if i had broken up the sod on my years of our lives in happiness and contentment beloved sections of
 prairie i would perhaps be perhaps somewhat isolated for an old couple but a wealthy farmer today nevertheless after i
 have we have our radio so manage to keep in contact been called to the last great roundup and with
 what is going on in the world our neigh this land becomes worn out and useless it will bours are
 all very kind to us now and seem to not be recorded that bob newbolt was the one have forgiven
 and forgotten all that happened in who turned it upside down cowboys not the same the cowboys of today declared
 a rancher are certainly not the same class of men as we had in the early times what one of
 them would stay all night with frozen feet watching a herd as i knew one of the old time boys
 to do none the duties which the presentday cowboy thinks are paramount are not the interest of his ranch but
 the necessity of getting into town as often as possible wearing shaps riding through the streets and getting as drunk
 as possible of cour se ther e are some exceptions i have a ranch out toward the hills where there
 are a bunch of cattle running in the early days it would take about six cowboys to handle these cattle
 today i have 16 men on the job i ll just give you an instance last summer there was some
 bubble headed galoot this is not the rancher s own language but it will answer the purpose in calgary who
 was paying a dollar each for rattlesnake hides down in this ranch of mine there are lots of rattlers well
 i got an order for 700 head of rough stuff and i went down to the ranch to have the
 boys bring in the cattle from which to pick the ears were waiting on the track there were a lot
 of ‘ tops right handy but i wanted rough steer s as i was getting a good price and did
 not have to send ‘ tops those 16 cowboys were out and i watched all day for cattle to begin
 to trickle in not a head came down and finally i was forced to load ‘ tops into the cars
 it cost me 10 000 along toward dark the cowboys began to come back and then i saw why it
 was that they had not brought in any cattle their saddles were loaded down with dead snakes dollar each in
 calgary they had come across a snake pit and spent the day in killing them forgetting all about their orders
 to bring in cattle would any of the old time cowboys have done that they would not edmonton daily capital
 march 21 1913 lars haukaness artist and instructor by helen collinson my position here is not altogether so bad only
 my salary is rather small and it also is a kind of slow process to bring the art school up
 to what i very much desire to bring it up to and convert it into the provincial art school of
 alberta firstly the connections with the provincial institute of technology and art is sici rather hampering like all other art
 schools attached to universities you know they never are a success secondly there is no appropriation for this art department
 and it is often hard to have the bilk paid for models and other requirements hence the creation of an
 independent provincial art school may not be attained in my lifetime at the same time so far i should not
 elmplain too much as we have been doing fairly well tho ‘ ii i the attendance could have been larger
 involving about liti this year in the summer of 1929 lars haukaness wrote these houghts to his friend lemoine fitz
 gerald describing his position as art instructor ili at the provincial institute of technology and art in calgary he had
 been living in the city since 1926 and a month after his arrival he had begun teaching the evening art
 classes this had marked the beginning of an active continuing program of professional instruction in the visual arts at an
 institution which later became the alberta college of art haukaness had a vision of an art school in calgary that
 far surpassed the reality of the time he was to remain in the city only three years until lars haukaness

 was an amateur one these ideas nor was he apt to have articulated both in intention and description in 1927
 them to his employer unless he felt a certain haukaness was invited to teach day classes at the degree of

 he arrived in the city he on hardanger fjord in norway in 1862 he was had just come from spending
 at least part of the the third son of a family of eight children born summer painting in the mountains

 the calgary art club felt profound love of nature and an early ability for that haukaness presence in town was
 an oppor drawing and painting he apparently painted all tunity for the local community to have the advan over the
 walls of his room and also decorated the tage of professional instruction he therefore doors of the barn with paintings
 of domestic introduced haukaness to w c carpenter then animals 4 he attended school only until he was the principal
 of the tech and encouraged the old enough to be confirmed in the local church formation of an evening class
 by guaranteeing in the town he was then apprenticed to a house several members this class began in october painter
 in the nearby town of kinsarvik where 12 he apparently impressed the local citizenry with his talent to the extent
 that a group of men raised money so that lars could attend art school in norway capital city of christiania
 oslo 2 in 1882 when lars haukaness was twenty ‘ years old he arrived in the capital and enrolled in
 a private art academy which was run by the painter knud bergslien he attended classes during the day here and
 augmented his education by attending evening classes at an arts and crafts school 6 the atmosphere in christiania at that
 r time was one of ferment and change and it must have been a great contrast to the quiet country
 life that the young man was used to living young norwegian artists and writers had recently returned to christiania from
 both paris and munich determined to bring change to the official christiania art association which was controlled at hat time
 by wealthy dilletantes whose taste was often conspicuously reactionary t 7 three of the artists who were in the thick
 of the controversy were at various times teachers and mentors of lars haukaness they were eric werenskjold christian krohg and
 fritz thaulow brother in law to paul gauguin 8 ‘ eric werenskjold who more than any other had led the
 successful strike against the christiania the three i 1 ukaness children who ei iigrated to the t 9 umted states

 studies he won the prize on the him as a designer and painter for the golden basis of a portrait

 did some portrait painting during these there is any record of haukaness being in chris early years in chicago and

 only reason that he was able to stay there as long his campfire on the shores of lake michigan near

 because of and it may have been an early piece 36 although his abject poverty haukaness returned to gran he
 tended to be a solitary individual his life yin where he continued to paint the landscape among his norwegian friends
 in chicago points around his native village 30 his formal training to a convivial warmth indeed some of his letters
 ended in 1886 and in addition to the influences imply a wry sense of humour even in the midst of
 his teachers he retained his deep love of nature of tribulation certainly he possessed a fatalism and close attachment to
 the norse legends 3 it that seemed to provide him with the ability to is likely too that aspects of
 a romantic and even continue in the face of great difficulty spiritual reaction to nature which was at least haukaness
 had been a member of the semi religious or mystical also had some effect norwegian art colony in chicago long
 before it upon his art 32 his life was one of poverty and became a focal point for exhibitions on
 a regular struggle and there is an indication that he had basis he was numbered among those artists contracted a
 debilitating disease likely tuber who were active in chicago between 1890 and culosis so he may have gone back to
 the coun 1910 at a time when most members were first try for the fresh air 33 certainly his return
 to generation norwegians most of whom had been granvin was a return to poverty and lack of trained in norway
 and had joined the chicago status norwegian art circle immediately upon arrival it is quite possible that the plethora of
 influ in the united states ences to which he had been exposed in chris few of them were able to
 support themselves tiania were factors that tended to prevent him through their art alone and lived as haukaness from finding

 sincerity and interest in art haukaness writings indicate a complete con and it was also through his effort that we
 had fidence in his superior 58 fifty two pupils during the first year that the art the work that haukaness
 did at the tech is school existed 62 not well documented from such contemporary a professional opinion of haukaness is

 respected although considered who graduated in sculpture in 1929 from the somewhat eccentric his former students in ontario college of

 nor stevenson be allowed to exhibit with them again we ing but did recall that he worked first from small
 rather enjoyed that m sketches of details that were to be included in his paintings and then would pull these
 details perhaps most significant is the fact that after together for the total painting two years of tutalage under haukaness
 in 1929 both maxwell bates and roy stevenson visited haukaness was apparently fond of mrs the chicago art institute and
 saw the post brucker s mother mrs s b dunlop who impressionist collections there for both it was befriended him
 he occasionally showed up a turning point according to robin neesham unannounced at the family home and often stayed for
 a meal when he went on painting trips he the last significant influence in w l stevenson s left some

 store supplies and opened a dispensary in connection with his practice this function was handled by alexander macdonald who was
 described as an old timer and stabler the office and dispensaiy were east of the elbow river but were moved
 over on the river ice to the new townsite during the winter of 1883 84 in the new location and
 later in a new building the dispensary was named medical hall and at times was referred to as a drug
 store in 1884 henderson directory listed both medical hall and trott s under the heading of drug stores 5 one
 might argue that a doctor s dispensary not oper ated by a pharmacist was not actually a pharmacy it is
 true that dr henderson himself was calgary s first qualified pharmacist having qualified prior to graduating in medicine at mcgill
 university and his medical hall was the first place which stocked and sold medicines however henderson practised as a physician
 not a pharmacist and employed a non qualified assistant to sell medicines later he sold his medical hall to doctor
 lauder and haldiman neither of whom have been identified as phar macists so a case can be made for samuel
 trott being calgary s first pharmacist owning w s 1 rott is seen here in october 1883 shortly before calgary
 s first traditional drug store moving from winnipeg to calgary the whole question of the first drug store did not
 arise during that period and not until 1928 cessor wendell maclean 5 interestingly was a flurry of interest generated in
 the subject however no one during this lively debate in that year trott s widow who had been a credited
 dr henderson with having opened generous benefactress of the calgary general alberta s first drug store let alone the first
 in hospital donated a brass plaque to be placed on calgary thus a century later one might conclude the foundation

 trott had been the operate what would have been considered a tradiowner of the first pharmacy in what is now
 tional free standing drug store maintained indeknown as the province of alberta 6 pendently of a medical office the statement
 stirred up a hornet s nest when between the years 1884 and 1891 the ones john d higinbotham of lethbridge

 is not clear whether higinbotham opened the listed as proprietors of medical hall in 1886 87 store on his own
 or on behalf of dr kennedy but nelson hoad arrived in 1887 to open a drug in 1885 higinbotham opened
 his own pharmacy store on stephen avenue and in 1888 a forin lethbridge where he became a leading citizen midable

 little of canada but it is to be hoped that they will not altogether gather their ideas about it from
 writings of their countrymen visiting it for a short time and writing their impressions with scarcely an exception these travellers
 do make the most dangerous statements though amusing to us who know the case recently calgar y has been suffering
 from this cause a settler s wife first telling old country people that farming was a failure in this district
 though she forgot to tell them that her own situation was chosen for scenery and not for agriculture as the
 agent warned her at the time now an english m p mr w s caine makes some ridiculous remarks about
 the town ‘‘ hardly a woman to be seen ofl the streets the population a swarm of cowboys farmers idlers
 and young men of rough occupation all the men in the place swarming to salvation army meetings etc why calgar
 y is a large thriving town introducing electric light water works and other evidences of advanced civilization it contains fine
 houses excellent stores good churches and other usual buildings while its schools hotels and other public places are first class
 it has a telephone system a fire brigade railway station post office telegraph office and all the incidental accessories of
 modern life perhaps the best test of all is that it sustains three large and excellent newspapers two weekly and
 one monthly the tribune herald and live stock journal its population contains a large proportion of males certainly but it
 is entirely misleading to intimate that it is composed as mr caine says the people are the equal in ability
 intelligence and propriety of any place the same size in canada and includes scores of ladies as fair and refined
 as would be met in the same sized town in the british empire the place itself is the centre of
 a very large and important district rich in stock raising and agricultural advantages in minerals and timber in game and
 furs with the valuable aids of delicious water charming scenery a beautiful climate and abundant coal fuel future travellers might
 remember that here cowboys and farmers are not classed with idlers and roughs they are considered necessary and respectable members

 25 joe crowfoot by george h gooderham joe crowfoot was born in 1892 the son of bear ghost or without
 a doubt a bear and grandson of the famous chief crowfoot joe s mother susie without a doubt a bear
 was a woman with plenty of drive and initiative bear ghost on the other hand was blind and sickly as
 i remember him in 1907 before 1912 the blackfoot were very poor they had had a fair sized herd of
 cattle but lost a great many in the hard winter of 1906 07 individual ownership was shown by number bands
 and all the cattle were handled as one herd the crowfoot brand was nearly wiped out by losses that winter
 at the same time living conditions were bad tuberculosis was rife and a large proportion of the band was on
 government relief very little farming was done in the district adjoining the reserve and hardly any on the reserve itself
 susie got a hut erected near the agency and the town of gleichen and lived there for many years she
 worked in town and for the agency staff washing clothes and scrubbing floors joe frequently accompanied her and being a
 bright and attractive youngster he got lots of tr eats and good food he also learned to speak english susie
 s earnings augmented the bare subsistence pro bear ghost son of crowloot and his wife susie are seen vided through
 government rations so the here aboout 1910 crowfoots lived better than many other indians and was away from home while
 susie cared for gleichen was a wild place in those days it was her husband who was now bedridden he
 died the only town of any size between medicine hat a few years later and his wife placed his body
 and calgary and it was there that cowboys would and personal belongings on a knoll overlooking make merry susie wasn
 t shy around this crowd a small lake a short distance from his last home she spoke enough english to
 attract the attention thereafter this body of water was known as of townspeople on the streets and in public susie
 s lake the family bond remained places her back chat was witty though limited strong and joe continued to support
 his mother joe was kept out of school to care for his blind although she still did some work in
 town father while the mother was at work he should by now joe had developed into a slight tall have
 attended the mission boarding school six man with fine features quick actions and a miles south of the crowfoot home
 but susie s excuse for his non attendance was accepted this was unfortunate nevertheless joe grew into a george gooderham
 was longtime indian agent on the fine young man blackfoot reserve and lamer the regional supervisor of indian agencies for
 alberta upon his reiirement in 1912 the band built a comfortable two in 1954 he joined the glenbow foundation and
 was roomed cottage for the crowfoots a mile south later with the riveredge foundation he wrote this of gleichen and
 put the old couple on relief joe article in 1956 his subject joe crowfoot died in got employment with the
 government stockman l 976 and the author passed away a year later 26 pleasing manner he was liked by everybody
 joe married maggie spotted eagle shortly after she left school and in 1921 they were located on a farm with
 the place went a new set of ‘ buildings the house was a four roomed cottage ‘ although it was
 later enlarged to six rooms ‘ ‘ ‘ almost immediately joe proved himself to be an outstanding and successful farmer
 and maggie kept a lovely home it was spotless and tastefully furnished and her housekeeping would have put most farm
 wives to shame it was the same in the barns and on the land joe was a hard worker and
 a perfectionist he loved good horse flesh and his work horses as well as his saddle horses were tops in
 the early thirties joe was made a councillor of the tribe at the request of his indian friends i was
 the indian agent and expected big things from him but was disappointed when he did not always agree with me
 i fear that i had become a bit of a dictator in the management of the band s large funds
 joe wanted progressive young men to be given more independence and assistance while he was not always consistent i now
 believe that he was more often right than i thought at the time joe crowloot in the earls 1930 s
 i always liked joe his escapades were so much fun for him that i could not think of him sories
 that such a journey demanded i did so being a bad egg i was proud to point him out from
 silk dressing gowns and leather travelling as a fine blackfoot and a successful farmer so bags and kits to well
 tailored suits we didn t when directors of the sydney fair board came forget joe s official chief s uniform
 either it was all the way from australia for indians and tailored to fit like a glove and no sea
 captain cowboys to take part in their show i was pleased ‘ looked smoother or more nautical than chief to
 suggest that crowfoot head the indian con crowfoot the plains indian tingent that was in the fall of 1938 the
 long journey by boat allowed him time to when arrangements were completed eight think and even to write crowfoot could
 only southern alberta indian cowboys and a couple write his name but as bear robe had some formal of white
 cowboys were signed up to take part in education he did the letter writing i received the the great sydney
 fair in the spring of 1939 two odd card from ports of call but the only real letter indians were
 picked from each of the blood i received from crowfoot was written in sydney blackfoot sarcee and stoney reserves they
 had here it is in his own style of words to be outstanding cowboys with records at the writing to
 you from sydney after we arrived on the calgary stampede good indian types and 11 th i m shaking hands
 with from across the ocean possessors of colourful costumes and tepees when we first dock we got a word we
 have to meet they were put on the payroll from the day they the lord mayor of sydney i met
 all the head people and they sure like me and the boys i feel like a btg left the reserve
 which was early in march until shot i ve learn a lot to know how good it is to be
 they were back home some months later a cor good and keep out off trouble it pays to have poral
 of the rcmp was in charge but joe was friends i m very sony about my pass days the senior

 had encountered a serious deficit in last year s of disbursements over receipts and shrinking our operations that our very
 future was in jeopardy nestegg to a paltry 1 880 by the end of 1982 and that president donna coulter
 announced that it was well into 1983 before the books were a fund raising drive had been launched to meet
 audited and the first indications of the problem the emergency became apparent cuts were made wherever we are pleased to
 report that to date more than possible but alberta history printing went up 20 000 has come in from members
 our by another 1 000 although other expenses such branches and interested supporters the money as stationery and travel were
 reduced conhas come from all parts of the province peace siderably even then the year ended with a fur river
 district to coutts and medicine hat to ther deficit and the fat was in the fire banff as well as
 from other areas of canada to meet the crisis membership fees were the names of all donors to date except
 those increased to 15 this year the newsletter was who wished to remain anonymous are listed in discontinued and the
 extra eight page picture this issue supplement and full colour cover for alberta the question has been raised by a
 number of history were dropped when new grants to fund members how could the society get in such a them
 could not be found fix well one must remember that the organiza these moves plus the generous help of our
 tion is a voluntary one and no one spends full members means that our financial problems for time on any
 aspect of its activities as a result the immediate future have been resolved there haven t been the ongoing financial
 controls however as president coulter has stated we are to constantly monitor its situation when one in the process of
 restructuring our accounting prolooks back over the past four years it is easy to cedures and will maintain stringent economies
 as see what happened even though it may not have long as they are needed already the executive been obvious
 at the time receives monthly statements of the society s we ll tr y to explain financial position right up
 until 1979 the society showed a the comments accompanying your donations modest profit in each year s operations in that
 have been very heartening here are a few year receipts over disbursements tota lled 2 714 samples while savings and
 investments came to over i often thought that the membership fee was 16 000 in 1980 postage costs doubled but
 in very low especially when it included such a come was virtually unchanged in that year we valuable historical journal
 so in a sense the extra should have shown a slight loss and the first funds we give will be
 making up for too low a warning signs should have appeared however membership cost over the years we received a
 grant of more than 19 000 to pro the society is doing excellent work and i duce the index to
 alberta history and spent only hope will be able to continue in its efforts 5 000 of it as a
 result we looked as though in vol 1 no 1 of the alberta historical we ended the year with a
 healthy surplus review in 1953 j g macgregor wrote some in 1981 the cost of printing alberta history thing that
 i believe to be very much still in eftook a jump as did other expenses no money feet he said
 ‘ will the review be a flash in the was expended on the index so although expendi pan and fizzle
 out that depends on you we tures surpassed income by 3 500 we still believe that if you will support
 the historical seemed to have a healthy balance so 1982 was society by joining it you will go a long
 way the year when all the problems seemed to come towards bringing about the objectives we have together first the
 supplies of stationery set ourselves with your support but only with envelopes etc which are ordered in three or it
 can we do these things ‘‘ four year quantities all ran out at once and we the society will continue
 to receive donations had to buy 2 000 more than usual also alberta to assist our financial position we are
 registered histon printing costs took another jump to a with revenue canada so all donors will receive 29 a tax
