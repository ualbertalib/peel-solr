 spinning should they fail the rock was tossed out 7 with a natural bend between two parallel ends a miniature
 saddle was placed in besides spinning tops boys loved to wrestle the crook and other trappings were added there were

 opponent over 8 small boys and girls enjoyed playing a large wrestling meets would be held by variety of group
 games such as tag etc adults with warrior societies competing during this time songs were sung and against each other
 one society would lau ghing was always heard however as provide a wrestler and the competing they grew older the
 girls began to work iety would find a challenger wrestling more around the lodge whereas the boys was also held

 wide at the middle and tapered slightly to the end three of the bones were unmarked on one side two
 of these had zigzag lines on the opposite side and the other the chief had thirteen equally distanced holes drilled
 into it the fourth bone called four was marked with a buckskin string them to the ends of willow whips
 on tied around it and had four holes and other occasions a group of boys might pick four grooves cut
 into four equal spaces a smaller boy and toss him in the air us this game was played with two
 women ing a buffalo robe they would toss him or t wo teams each woman playing her higher and higher
 and would not end the 1 opposing neighbour the sticks ends were game until he screamed for them to stop

 month and there was a soft chinook wind blowing all at once there was a roar and the whole river

 and a couple of to safety in another minute the current and a couple of saddle saddle horses which also
 served to cut would have borne him away the hay i he cattle mixed with everyone horses which also served
 else s and roamed far back when sloughs were plentiful when these dried up the to cut the hay river
 was their drinking place old range cows would come running in for a drink leaving a bunch of their calves
 in the care of one mother cow while they were away when we first came we had been told below
 our place were deep cutbanks fifty that it was not hard to get schools estabfeet high where seams of coal
 cropped lished as soon as we could we applied out and here the river rounded a bend at the department
 of education regina and went out of sight it was here we got which was the capital of the north
 west our coal for fuel and the river provided territories they told us that our part of above us with
 driftwood for kindling from it the country was too sparsely settled the a familiar sight to the cayfords were too
 we got our water supply so you see river being a barrier between us and our the range cattle this

 mysteries of horses and harness we the speed of passenger expresses and with acquitted ourselves well especially as the heavy
 hearts we decided to walk for we outfit was shorthanded save for one old dare not face our former work
 mates in man he is now i believe in montreal the morning so at midnig ht we started amid so
 i dare mcntiomm the exception we off toward medicine hat once more met men with whom it was a p
 leasure to work for and with when we when as it often happened a train left it was with great
 regret one of us got approached we hid like crmmmnals in the the sack and the other naturally left growth
 omi the siding at one such time we both found such a comfortable spot before i heave stirling i must
 tell a true that we decided to sleep our hips found story against myself for it is morally a nice
 little hollow and our heads a beau certain that if i do miot someomie else will tiful p illow the
 uneven ground proved it must be definitely understood that on to be the work of amits in short we lay
 on leaving the old country we came out an amir hill up we jumped on learning surprisingly igmioranmt on mamiy
 matters this amid contimiued on our way stoppimig one of these being as has beemi proved in at one place
 i forget its miame to snatch my case but i anticipate to niy tale an hour or two s sleep
 under an elevator one mornmuig i was taking my horses approach and imicmdentally to shelter us aown to tue coulee
 to qrmnk i should miave from the rain which had ust commenced mentioned that i was the last for the
 har at last we reached medicine hat and mak ness had not beemi on its best behaviour ing enquiries we
 were sent to wiminifred that morning to resume as i sat astride wenty five miles to the west taking the
 the one amid dragged the other i saw a train that nig ht and finding no one to meet bumich
 of beautiful ftmr bobbimig up amid us we emitered an office of one of the eleva dowmi in the stubble
 to the surface came tors amid had a good night s sleep in the those latent ideas of adventure that
 in morning we found our employer who part prompted me to come to canada took us out into the field
 to show us stook this animal i was determined to have ing a job we took kindly to amid after
 but how to get it that was the questiomi finishing his fields we were in demand for i had no
 weapomms of any kind save a poefe mmr or five small farmers ket knife amid who knows what a strange
 animal mig ht be capable of for imistance description ‘ tis in such times one realizes a bite mig ht
 mean a poisonous infection the inadequacy of the english language i not bug however did i hesitate such knew in
 a second what i had encountered a prize was not to be lost though for for though i had never
 seen a skunk nor several secomids i was lost in admiration had i ever seen a picture of one yet
 has of the beast the while imagining the fur their fame travelled far and wide around my sister s neck
 or made into a ‘ i felt a vapour enter my right over the rest of the story i wish
 i could collar for my mother follow the example of the skunk and draw ‘‘ eye and the air was
 polluted action was necessary if i was to procure a veil a sadder and wiser man caught his it so
 jumpiuig off my horse i gave chase horses mounted and turned their faces 1 i n ‘ r ‘ with
 a smell a smell that tnougn wutn no oerunite pian or attack towara a purer atmospnere neiieve me imagine my
 surprise to find that i was those horses ran as they never ran before fast gaimiing omi it this gave
 me time to nor did they stop m intil able to bury their baffles description ‘ tis in think i
 decided that my best method was noses in oats to kick it to death though i am not by such
 times that one realizes my entry into the cook car was the signal miature cruel this appeared the only way
 for a general though nor very orderly accordingly i braced myself up for the the inadequacy of the english ‘
 exit inside of t wo seconds i had that cook attack and starting like a footballer taking ‘ car to
 myself dimmer time came and with apenahty shot landed that poor animal a my meal served separate outside and so
 language i knew in a second kick calculated to end its days i lifted it ‘ at supper the approach
 of the cook was in clear off the ground and then waited ‘ itselfascream shewouldholdhernoseand what i had encountered for
 nothing happened the only effect being ‘ ‘ ask first which way the wind was blowing that it shook itself
 and started off agaimi ‘ though i had never seen a l t tne rirst meeting i nan tnus garneci
 notn i tnrew away my snirt ann trousers in ing but as i had not been bitten i decided favour
 of others i had brought with me to tr y again the modus operandi to be as but still the
 smell was bad i was fortun skunk nor had i ever seen a before whereas previously i had caught ate
 that i had miot to sleep outside very it a kick on its side this time i would find fortunate
 providing i placed my boots at picture of one yet has their a more vulnerable spot a good distance away
 from the tent i was allowed my usual place fame travelled far and wide full now ofthe spirit ofthe chase
 i started forth again and as though to give me a previously we had been throwing bundles better chance the
 creature lifted up that in from both sides to the feeder of the beautiful tail i could have laughed aloud
 separator but this had to be altered and below for here was exposed a mark indeed si arranged so that
 i unloaded alone nor the author learned the hard way muitaneous with my second kick i felt a on such
 occasions could the separator man that a skunk is not an animal to be vapour enter my right eye and
 the air was be found like the sergeant major of old trtf led with polluted with a smell a smell
 that baffles he was scrounging in the deep dug out alberta history summer 1993 ie the strawstack i ll gamble
 the other the first morning i was given the joke teamsters never gave so much attention pair of horses of
 the outfit though i did to the direction and strength of the winds not know it this team we later
 called the in their lives before sitting down team as one of the horses a so much for stirling we
 left as i said big shire took every opportumiity to rest if we were to stop but for the space
 of with regret weeks later i was to receive five seconds to pitch a stray bundle no from a wag
 the following limerick matter the horse would fall back on its there was a young man of the city haunches
 and be quite a while before it would come back to normal i leave to who saw what he thought
 was a kitty the memory of those few spectators my he gave it a pat and said nice little cat
 circular ride omi my first morning seated omi one horse amid dragging the other the so they buried his clothes
 out of pity shire persisted despite my feeble efforts to check it in first sitting down and aid this from
 a girl how cruel when roused to career round amid round we were not to be idle long however for
 the horse i was astride on entering a store and incidentally having a pleasant chat we were asked if we
 later i got a sane pair of horses what they wanted further work of a similar nature thought of me
 fortunately i miever got to know but i can guess though in abili ty on answering in the affirmative the
 phone was brought into play and froni raymond i may not have been the equal of some of came a
 man to take us in his car i learned the others yet was i consciemitious at my first turn at
 the separator one morning i later that he was dubious of our capabilities but perfectly willing to give us a
 got to my rack made haste to hook up tryout we slept at his house that night and getting on
 my full rack drove in two hired boys roused us early the next whatever else i usually pulled in well
 morning and took us out to where the this morning however i had drivemi too outfit was working the young
 man s far in my excitement but was incapable brother being in charge of operations of correcting myself pulling at
 the lines i hopelessly cried back back conic back i have written in terms of deepest regard but all to
 no purpose that something was and that regard heartfelt of my former wrong i had no doubt but what it
 was employers and other companiomis but i had not the least idea a smile played these people i must enthuse
 on their un over the features of my employer and affected freedom and goodness however he shook his head in
 wonderment as he this is not a portrait gallery so i cannot left me to find out for myself finally
 i though i could wish it were possible to got off my rack and snapped the lines g ive them
 each a separate place yet i am to the bridle something i should have compelled to mention our hostess the
 done when i hooked up two brothers a japanese amid the separator man oh these were nattire s gentlemen on
 account of the combimiatiomi underwear but i digress the second day my employer i wore which was too right imi
 the heat said joe of the day i got into the habit of tying the arms round my waist to
 you this well would not be interesting but they still how long did you say you have threshed have not
 forgotten it in raymomid eight days and the kick i got at the hands or rather well you handle your
 pitchforks like the feet of a restless horse was of paramount old timers interest and concern for me but to
 you it is emiough to know that i was kicked work from then on was a double pleasure three weeks
 work was the run and dur never shall i forget nioving from one ing that period the mistakes that this
 poor farm to another amid on reaching the new child made will be amusing and it may place driving close
 to the house to unbe not lacking in interest load sund ry saucepans frying pans and foodstuffs being noon i
 unhooked my team and as the lines were tied up i told them to get up this they did to
 my consternation for i had omitted to hook the furthest trace down the hill they madly galloped the rack bumping
 them at every step i clinging to one of them in an attempt to direct their path the surprise to
 me was in all my misadventures i had done no actual damage at last threshing over it behoved us ever
 y one to look to our next move my pal who for some time had not enjoyed the best of
 health had at my advice gone to lethbridge to see a doctor and to await my coming reaching town i
 found him in bed unable to speak and straight away sent for another doctor this doctor soon put him omi
 the way to recovery it was of course miecessary that i live at the same boarding house until my friend
 regained his health this period proving to be a up and weighing joints scraping pigs and week here again we
 found in our hour skinning cows watering the stock milkof need true friends though total strangers ing cows and all
 the other hundred and the lady who kept the boarding house one jobs to be found on any farm every
 never shall i forget moving had nursed bill with all the care of a where it seemed people did their
 best to mother for three days prior to my arrival make life worth living for here again did i from
 one farm to another and when he came to leave having booked find kindness and consideration his passage home she
 would only accept half the usual fee the doctor too lowered such us a summaiy of my experiences as a
 and on reaching the new place harvester and while not denying that there his charge and was said to have
 remarked to the landlady why they are only boys may be cases of hardship for unless we driving close to
 the house 1 are in possession of all the facts were unable mere doys i woumcs mentuoum tne ract tnat
 i too was treated most generously at the to judge yet i would lift my little voice to unload sundry
 saucepans hands of the lady of the boarding house and say in conclusion that i have found a welcome not
 a gushing welcome who bill left for england undoubtedly his wants gush and with a cool review of frying pans
 and foodstuffs illness contributed toward his decision tne situation it is my personal opinion that simice then i am informed
 he is makinc at last threshing over it opportunities are in evidence at least at all arrangements to return in
 the sprung the very least provided a young man us beumig a craftsman he is of the opinion behoved us
 every one to look willing to work he can live and live well that the east is his best place
 after my duty was done by him i went as had to tell you what i am doing now would
 to our next move been arranged to diamond city to live be to disclose my identi ty and not wishfor
 a while with a threshing pal ing to become the object of derision for unsuccessfully did we walk day after
 day this reason i subscribe to a nom de plume to the mine at commerce looking for we came out
 to expand our knowledge work and it really looked as though winter and to gain experience if we profit by
 such above would take a big toll out of my threshing mistakes as herein set forth so much the crews
 load grain into wagons during earnings when i got wind of a job for the better and we shall avoid
 them in future i the harvest the author became quite travelling butcher of the neighbourhood have by no means expended
 my adven adept at his work by the time the 1923 season was over snu got hired again here was
 new work tures but tnus will suffice to give you an altogether to anything i had ever been ac insight
 into the learning by mistakes of one customed killing hogs and cattle cutting of the harvesters who has no regrets
