 adventures in the crowsnest pass by george bolton the summer of 1897 i had been helping with the harvest at
 carman manitoba after threshing was finished i headed for winnipeg hoping to obtain a job in the city for the
 winter had i understood french i could soon have landed a job otherwise there was nothing in sight i had
 seen a notice saying men wanted to work on construction of the crowsnest ry free transportation one had to apply
 at the c p r station so i headed for the station there i found many men walking up and
 down the long platform all dressed in heavy mackinaw coats and german socks and rubbers some were talking of going
 to the bush to work others to the crowsnest pass one man whom i took to be an old timer
 was telling the boys what to expect if they chose to go to the crowsnest saying they would be living
 in tents and the weather might be anything between 45 and 60 below zero in my togs i looked much
 like a boy just out of sunday school and fifteen years of age although i would be twenty one at
 that time i appeared so much younger than the my train was already spotted on the other men standing about
 that i kept to track in front of the depot so i climbed myself i knew little about working in
 the aboard and sat looking out the window bush so thought i would try the construc onto the platform below
 apparently a tion work entering the c p r station on train was due from the east and a number
 my right was a long hallway where stood of young folks arrived to meet the train a number of nien
 with their backs to the noticing me in the window they pointed wall i inquired where do i apply for
 at me telling others to look at the kid work on the crowsnest pass and was very likely they knew
 i was headed for told to go to the last wicket down the hall the crowsnest with the rest of
 the men way there i found the agent to sign men they could also see in the coach when the
 on for work but none were coming forward train arrived from the east a large num i was given my
 pass and told to be sure ber of welshmen joined our party these and take blankets as i was leaving
 i over boys had just arrived from the old counheard one of the men ask the agent what try to
 work on the construction once is that kid going to do up there aboard we were soon away oh said
 the agent we have lots of this was the first year of my life i had jobs for young fellows
 like him wish we been out in the world on my own although could only get more of them a
 little timid i felt and enjoyed the free well replied the man if that kid can doin of it all
 many of the boys settled stand it surely to god we can come on down to card playing a game
 i knew noth jack let s sign up with that the whole ing about for i had never had a
 pack of line of men moved forward cards in my hand in my life however i george bolton spent his
 early years as a construction worker and cowboy in alberta british columbia and montana a veteran of the first world
 war he was living in retirement in new westminster b c when this article first appeared in 1954 the bridge
 building crew for the crowsriest pass railway is seen here in 1897 this is the same year the author worked
 in the area was anxious to see what was going on and house which was situated not far from was
 watching a game when one of the where the men were ploughing and scrapplayers seeing me standing behind him ing
 on the right of way i wonder if this said say kid go and sit down it s back would
 be the old maunsell ranch with your mother you ought to be after lunch and a good rest we continu
 there was very little to see but open ed on to the oldman river where we found prairie moose jaw
 was just a village and our camp looking like a town of tents in other places along the way were
 much smal the klondike days i with another young 1 cr calgary was the most up to date lad who
 was there ahead of me were detown most interesting to note were the tailed to wait on table and wash
 dishes different characters that lined the platform about the third day my helper left and i of the station indians
 with their women had to wait on the nien alone to do so selling buffalo horns several with bead 1
 had to run all the time i was finally given work all very nicely finished mounted a man to help
 me but the men made so police men with leather leggings and rid much fun of him that he soon
 left me to ing breeches and a number of others that myself again i was young and full of really
 would have made a fine picture with pep and enjoyed it all the weather went the little low station in
 the background to 45 below zero and all vegetables and even the bread was frozen so it was diffi i
 expect the police were watching to see cult to cut the loaves and my hands were that none of us
 left the train for we were now not far from our destination and work terribly blistered cutting slices for over
 a hundred men the welsh boys tried toast on arriving at macleod we were told ing the bread on the
 stove in the dining to put our baggage in the wagon and walk room tent and were disgusted to see
 it go behind this we did all the way to oldman up in black smoke the welshrnen called river where
 we were to put in the abut me the pretty boy and taught me what ments for the bridge this
 would be a few to say in welsh when the boys got in my miles from pincher creek in the
 foothills way something like carafaul meaning i remember we stopped for lunch at a ranch get out of my way
 the food was mostly placed on the table before the men entered were in camp on the plains the teamsters
 and the steam from the same filled the camp joined that of the concrete gang and tent with a thick
 fog so that when the there were many battles over liquor the men entered they sometimes tripped over boys of
 the concrete gang would give the one another teamsters money to buy whiskey and some the walls of the large
 dining tent soon times the whiskey disappeared before it became a solid sheet of ice the river was reached camp
 teamsters tents were somefrozen over and every day i had to dig times ripped down and searched for liquor deeper
 into the river for water till the at times it got so bad that the mounties hole was several feet
 deep cattle bawled appeared on the scene i can see the mounnight and day travelling up and down the ties
 on their horses come sliding down the river looking for water provisions were steep bank the mounties were something running
 short and the men were starting to new to the men from the east and they complain about the meals
 we were short respected them greatly whenever they visitof coal and the men started cutting down ed the camp trees
 along the river bank ranchers com it was the last week in december i 897 plained about the cutting of
 trees which when we finished the abutments for the was the only shelter for their stock so the bridge we
 were to move to the loop at mounties soon put a stop to this now we blairmore and the carpenters
 were to take noticed our fuel disappearing for the kit over i remember the civil engineer wantchen the cook and
 baker were profession ing me to stay on saying he had a ranch al fighters from england but kept it
 to i believe near lethbridge and when the themselves they were out for the experi bridge was finished he would
 like me to go ences and were heading for the klondike home with him to this ranch i think his
 in the spring in their spare time they spar name was doyle or boyle i just forget red with each
 other in the dining tent at however i felt i was one of the concrete times using me for a
 punching bag knock crew and wished to go on with the boys ing me all over the place oh said
 one to the loop it was a strange sight to see of the boys if i could only teach you
 to the boys stretched along the trail in single box a mule couldn t hurt you i was told file
 climbing the foothills through the snow to keep an eye on the fuel and to let the we stopped at
 a ranch house for lunch cook know if i saw anyone stealing and then continued on to crowsnest lake at
 last i saw the man who had told me we passed a sulphur spring you could to sit down in
 the train i rushed in and see it some distance from the tote road for told the boys about him
 telling me to go it had colored the snow yellow and one back to my mother the boys brought could
 also smell it for some distance away him into the diner and produced two pairs we reached the lake in
 the evening and of boxing gloves they told us to put them spent new year s day there i remember
 on and said the baker if you don t lick we ate in a restaurant at one very long that
 fellow kid i ll knock you clean over table i was seated at the table with our the tent well
 i was tough and had had foreman mr mckinnon and not feeling considerable training or rather knocking well and i
 gave the waiter the sign for about and came out the winner my op liquor one for me and one
 for myself ponent was much older than i and as he my first drink this was poured from a left
 i shouted after him to go back to his tea pot as i noticed a mountie was seated mother at
 the far end of the table after dinner i the mounties paid us a visit about once climbed to the
 top of a hill overlooking the a week and warned us to look out for a town which was all
 built of logs to see rush of water when the river broke up if the doctor there could give me
 some why the bridge was built at this particular thing for a cold this was doctor saul bonplace i don
 t know only at this point the nell he gave me some pills we left this river had lots of
 get away for after leav wild woolly town jan 2 nd 1898 i rememing its regular channel it could spread
 over ber we had not gone far when i noticed a gravel bar many yards wide it was on quite
 a stream of water coming from a this bar we had our camp the banks of cave this i was
 told was the source of the river were so high and steep it would the oldnian river be difficult to
 get to and from work if we arriving at the loop we found our camp of log buildings with bunks
 for beds one it was like coming out of hell into heaven bunk above the other a mattress made for
 here was a wide open plain known as from cedar boughs our blankets and per tobacco plains there was one
 building sonal belongings made up the rest of our and i stayed for the night bed at night i could
 not see the candles the following morning i headed west for tobacco smoke ventilation was very again but before leaving
 i noticed a sign poor indeed the food was good but the on a tree saying this trail goes to
 monwork was terrible ever sliding mud and the tana and for a while i was tempted to hours of labor
 from dark to dark follow it for many miles there was no i was the first to fall sick with
 the flu sign of life till i overtook two welsh boys i had very little appetite for anything for with
 a cayuse and hoine niade sleigh on about two weeks i drank warm water and the sleigh was a chest
 of carpenters tools although we paid one dollar per month and some oats for the horse all went well for
 medical service i received none in any till we came to a very steep hill apparently shape or form i
 heard of some tales after the hill was only meant for one way traf i left the loop others contracted
 the flu fic there was a much better grade farther and did not come off so well as 1 while
 to the south the boys had gone about half at the loop i learned that the boys at the way
 up the hill when they met head on oldman river bridge were flooded out and with a four horse team
 coming all speed lost all their belongings one team of down the hill with a big load of frozen horses
 hitched to a load of coal was drown beef the pony and tools were forced over ed later the temperature
 went down to the bank and the older of the two welsh 45 below boys followed after the load of
 beef at the bottom of the hill the teamster stopped to recovering from the flu i left my friend apologise
 to the boys saying he had never john mckinnon and hit out for kootenay been over the road before and
 owin to landing alone and afoot the cook at the a sharp curve at the top of the hill he
 could camp put inc up a lunch to eat along the not see what was ahead way otherwise i made
 no preparation for the trip and had little or no knowledge of the boys gathered up tools and the pony
 what was ahead of me which was only slightly damaged and on reaching the top of the hill we found
 a the country was mostly as god had left stopping place called sandpoint the woit and for long stretches there
 was little to man in charge was quite lonely and was be seen but trees rivers and mountains more than
 pleased when she learned my after leaving the loop i don t remember companions were welsh and could sing seeing
 any sign of life or activity till i rca while she played the piano the boys sang ched coal creek
 later called fernie here songs till well past midnight a few miles men were clearing right of way a few
 log past sandpoint the boys left me to take cabins were built near the creek some were the trail to
 fort steele where they hoped places of business i believe tritas and to get work at their trade woods were
 doing business at that time for a number of miles it was a lonely i reached coal creek about 3
 p m but did hike for i saw no sign of life wild or othernot remain long and continued on
 my way wise till i was nearing a place called wardwest ncr here men were clearing the right of soon
 i entered a canyon steep walls of way and making the timber into ties at rock on my left and
 a fast running stream this camp i met the man who was cook on my right for the first time
 i thought for the teamsters at oldman river bridge of this as a pass and that it would continue i
 can only remember his first name dan for many miles it was beginning to snow he was considered to be
 one of the best and i felt anything but comfortable in such cooks in the west had been cook on
 dinsurroundings and wondered where i could ing cars and at c p r hotels i believe bed down for the
 night however i did he fell out of a hotel window at banff and not go far when i came
 to a little bridge was killed on seeing me he said my god made of poles which crossed the river
 and here s the kid packing his school books landed me at the bottom of a very steep i had
 had but very little schooling and was hill on the opposite side on reaching the trying to learn what i
 could from books top of the hill i got the surprise of my life i had to discard a webster
 dictionary for i found my pack getting heavy dan pointed out with german socks and rubbers for to where wardner
 now stands and said he had on a light pair of shoes which were do you see that building over
 there that s pinching his feet badly he could not bend a hotel and it will soon be ready now
 if his knees but managed to shuffle his feet you will stay in wardner i ll have you through the
 snow the farther he went the help me in the kitchen for i will be the better he got but
 how he managed to keep chef if i remember right the stevens going is a mystery to me for our
 hike was brothers were proprietors i later met them long with hardly a stop for miles i rememin calgary when
 they managed the queen s ber passing what was called cranbrook hotel and later the alexander hotel 1907 but the
 only sign of action was a man with a load of lumber which he dumped on the however i did
 not stop at wardner although there was more work going on there open prairie for there was nothing else in
 than any place in the pass a saw was in sight in the way of buildings this would action sawing
 lumber for the hotel and be january 1898 i noticed a small nurnother buildings to be erected shortly after her
 of men at work cutting into a bank bepassing wardner i came upon a man lying side the tote road
 which i understood was the foundation for the c p r round house beside the tote road suffering from inflamatory
 rheumatism just how far this would that day we marched many miles and be from wardner i couldn t say
 there was far into the night without rest or eats i nothing to tell one how far he had walked
 noticed a strange light shining through the and there were trees on both sides of the trees and a little
 farther on a trail leading road in fact a virgin forest it took some in the direction of the light
 i took the trail effort on my part to get this man up and which led me to a huge
 log building that on to the trail i remember his name was once i expect was occupied by the survey
 godfrey and he was from ontario age gang burlap covered windows and door about 24 years when i got him
 to his feet pulling the burlap to one side i saw a lone he said i never have told my
 mother a man seated by a huge fire place i had given lie in my life but when i write
 and tell him quite a start for he was not expecting her this she won t believe it i fitted
 him anyone at that hour of the night i enquired camp of a grading outfit on the crowsnest pass railway
 construction this view was taken in the foothills at the entrance to the pass grading outfit at work on the
 crowsnest pass railway in 1897 if i could get some eats oh said the and go ahead of the horses
 and when i man i ve only a little flour and those two saw a place to turn off the
 road to let him small trout you see hanging up there but know we went on for about another mile
 you re welcome to stay for the night i but could see no place to turn off the road told
 him i was more hungry than tired and i felt quite at home with the lantern and told him his
 bit of flour and the two fish could have walked on the rest of the night brought to my mind
 the story of christ who but i was very hungry and was glad to fed the 5000 with five barley
 loaves and hear the teamster say we will unhitch two small fishes he replied if you could the horses on
 the trail and camp do that i would sure be glad of your corn i helped the man fix up
 his horses for pany the night then we took a large tarpaulin i returned to the tote road and continued
 off the hay which we spread on the snow with my friend walking late into the night and on this
 we put our blankets this done my mind drifted back to ontario and the we started a fire and the
 teamster made turkey dinners at that time of the year and up a real good meal for the three of
 us the nice feather bed i had left behind it that nieal did us till about 5 p m the
 next was then we heard bells and lo and be day when we reached the supply camp hold there was
 a four horse team coming we had travelled up and down hill all day around the bend in the road

 hay with a lan we see any sign of activity here some men tern by his side we gave him
 quite a start were starting the foundation for a sawmill for he took us for bears he inquired how we
 stayed all night at the supply camp far was it to the supply depot i told him and left the
 following morning after travelwe knew nothing about the country or ling for some distance west of the supply places and
 he replied that it was his first camp we again ran into men clearing righttrip over the road and that

 turn tried a different camp to get them to look off the trail and camp for the night he after

 in the early days of 1865 father lacombe was relieved of his responsibilities over the growing settlement and was given
 the mission of coursing the prairies to bring christ s message of love to the savage crees and blackfoot he
 was frankly delighted with his lot st albert was becoming too civilized for me he commented he was to return
 frequently to his beloved hill but only to help in times of trials or pressing need from 1865 to 1867
 fathers j tissot and a andre continued the work so well begun in 1867 father andré 0:andre was replaced at st
 albert by father hippolyte leduc who was to take sole charge of the mission in the spring of 1868 he
 was to guide the material destinies of st albert for 28 years an organizer of genius he contributed more than
 any one else to bring the st albert community to a state of progress and development unequalled this side of
 st boniface though scholarly and highly gifted he spoke english in his own inimitable way a man of vision and
 enterprise he could elaborate vast plans and see to every detail his understanding of men his good judgement and remarkable
 flair in business transactions made him a valuable organizer and counsellor bishop grandin soon named him his vicar general and
 confided to his care the temporal administration of his vast northern diocese which comprised what is today northern saskatchewan alberta
 and the northwest territories bishop vital grandin during the winter of 1863 64 a group of gold miners who had
 come to pan on the shores of the saskatchewan river were hired to cut logs to enlarge the first chapel
 and to finish the orphanage these were paid in goods at the price of a beaver skin for a day

 about 300 souls had settled on their own farms now well cleared and fenced and their grain fields danced gaily
 in the wind while small gardens displayed everywhere a welcome abundance on the 3 rd of december 1864 bishop taché 0:tache

 of st albert so advanced and yet so new what a great work had already been done handsome and vast

 yielding abundant harvests all this we could not leave without admiration soon after his arrival father leduc received a letter

 was recovering but practically the whole settlement was affected and only two or three of the school children were able
 to run errands on his way to st albert bishop grandin overtook a young man fleeing from st albert clasping
 a blanket in one hand and a piece of meat in the other frantic with fear and shouting everybody is
 dying when he arrived the bishop needed rest but took none he visited every home cared for every person one
 by one encouraging and consoling preparing broths for them with his own hands and especially sending up his ardent prayers
 to the common father in heaven that the plague might cease many are convinced that a large number of metis
 and indians and their descendants owe their lives to those prayers but when told that he had performed a miraculous
 cure the humble dignitary attributed the marvellous effects to the herbs that he boiled in water and served to his
 patients this statue of father lacombe was erected on the hill at st albert as a tribute to the missionary
 priest on april 19 th 1870 father lacombe was hastily called to fort edmonton at 10 o clock at night
 he galloped from st albert to the fort in record time and his speedy intervention is credited with having saved
 the fort and its inhabitants from death and destruction from the hands of the dreaded blackfoot already camped on the
 opposite side of the river his movements and shouts on the river s edge almost cost him his life from
 the rifle of one of the guards in august bishop grandin was at carlton where he found nearly every one
 grievously ill with smallpox he made himself their doctor and their nurse helping them by the close of september the
 epidemic abated at st albert five of the orphans had died and out of 700 metis and indians who sought
 refuge in the settlement some 300 were mowed down by the plague the bishop priests and nuns had given every
 possible assistance to the stricken while the lay brothers were kept busy digging large sized graves and burying the dead
 as soon as possible to halt the spread of the disease it was calculated that 300 hunters from the district
 had died on the prairie at the buffalo hunt at which father fourmond attended while 3 000 crees and blackfoot

 jan 31 1881 off to the kiondike by eben mcadam editorial note some months ago dr andrew stewart president of
 the university of alberta announced the gift to the university of the collection of notebooks written by eben mcadam on
 his journey across the canadian north west to the yukon in 1898 and 1899 the collection one of the most
 interesting received by the university in recent years was presented by miss linda mcadam of west roxbury massachusetts it has
 been placed among the archives of the rutherford library the most interesting items in this collection are two notebooks containing
 mr mcadam s diary from march 17 th 1898 to july 4 th 1899 these appear to be second and
 third of a series of three notebooks of which the first is missing mr mcadam began his journey from his
 home in montreal and travelled by rail to duck lake saskatchewan from there on he and his party travelled by
 boats pack horses and toboggans for fourteen months by way of green lake isle a ia crosse lake and the

 river beyond the arctic circle to fort mcpherson and finally up the peel river to the wind river and across
 the mackenzie mountains through a pass to the headwaters of the stewart river in the yukon east of dawson city
 over most of this route mr mcadam s party of five packed a total of two and a half tons
 of supplies and even so they found these were barely adequate to provide for their winter needs in the camp
 they established in the autumn of 1 898 on the wind river the diary gives a draniatic account of drownings
 of men tracking up the northern rivers scurvy in the winter camp and finally the crossing of the pass into
 the kiondike gold fields mr mcadam s party arrived at duck lake on march 12 th and a few days

 c the future does not promise any means of the hunting party arrived home today securing same without repeating a
 great after an absence of 9 days and reported deal of last summer s hard work bad luck they did
 not kill anything and sunday 25 th december ‘ 98 christwere compelled to return sooner than they inas have neglected
 my diary for a long expected owing to lack of provisions time and think this is a good day to
 enter it to date there is not much to enter as sunday 30 th oct ‘ 98 have given up
 life here continues about the same writing daily diary life is quiet and each day is pretty much a repetition
 of previous christmas here again what a change in days we are now fully settled in our shack a year
 4500 miles from home and not and so are all other parties snow has fallen a cheering word for nine
 months where almost every day and is now fully 15 to will we be twelve months hence in this 18
 inches deep around our shacks and is country will we meet with success during said to be twice as deep
 in the hills the the next year what i would give to see indians have not made a second visit
 yet my two little darlings today no doubt they we would like to see them as our share are enjoying
 themselves and perhaps thinkof their first visit only lasted a week the ing of me river has not frozen yet
 but is gradually all our toboggans are ready and we falling and the shores are slowly approach have decided to
 leave our shack permaning each other hunting parties are con ently about the 15 th january ten loads tinually going
 out but without success the are cached about 8 miles up we will probsnow is gradually deepening however and ably
 move our caches about 8 miles each if andrew s the indian guide remarks move our camp midway so that
 at no are correct the animals should appear very time will we be more than 4 miles from shortly in
 the valleys the deep snow in camp this we consider advisable in order the hills drives them into the low
 country to avoid danger in the event of storms com during the past two weeks have made ing up suddenly
 a moose skin coat and pants they fit fairly we had a visit from the indians a week well and
 i hope will answer the work they ago ten dog teams came down with meat are intended for the hi
 weekly concerts and all here will have a good christmas continue and show improvement as the dinner we had three
 meals today season advances our last concert was the breakfast at 7 a rn dinner at 12 a m supbest

 remains from dinner to repeat each sunday 26 th december ‘ 98 did not get up till have secured all
 the wood necessary for late as we did not go to bed till 2 am the winter and about all
 the work now is spent part of last evening at mitchell s to cut same and bring it into the
 shack shack aiid had a good drink first since i several shafts have been sunk but at a left montreal
 did not remain late as mr depth of about 10 feet water came in and mcgruder from the lower shacks
 was here prevented digging to bed rock hope later and promised us a spiritualist meeting in to go deeper our
 shacks are built in a the evening at our concert it began about heavy spruce bush growing on what ap
 9 p m and lasted till i a ni besides our pears to be an ancient river bed we think
 party dr brown dr sloan judge morse if bed rock can be reached we might pos and george dalgleish were
 present mcsibly settle any doubt as to whether there gruder called our nieeting a fairly successare any prospects on this
 river expect to ful one the spirits spoke quite freely i begin shortly on our toboggans for carry was the
 only one who did not converse ing supplies up to the pass our present each asked a number of questions
 relative to the health of family and friends and thursday and friday 29 and 30 th inst also our prospects
 in the gold fields the we took up loads to our 8 mile cache answers received as regards our prospects
 three loads and four loads 1 went up both were very satisfactory our party is to take days the work
 is very hard even more so out 1 500 000 the spirits also told us than tracking it is a
 steady strain from that the river at the head of this stream start to finish and the return trip seems
 is the stewart let us hope that what we more than 20 miles our present cache is heard has at
 least some truth in it i am a mistake it is too far to go without a rest so the
 spirits said to receive seven letters and some refreshments after our present and some photographs when the indians move will
 probably move in two 4 mile return what fools we mortals are stages with a good dinner in between dur
 31 st december 1898 the last day of ing our hauling yesterday the thermometer showed 42 degrees below zero the
 year 1898 is passing away and tomorrow will see us launched into a new year 2 nd january ‘ 99
 my birthday the new with all its doubts and anxieties there is year s day passed quietly in the morning
 nothing to do but hope paid a call to each of the shacks the scurvy has broken out three cases
 in weather was mild for this country show wind city and eight or nine below the ing only zero today
 i began putting my ramparts with very serious prospects for a clothes and sundry articles in order preconsiderable increase of
 the trouble the paratory to moving away from the shack cause appears to be unknown the doctors will probably take
 up a couple of loads this week recognize the symptoms but cannot account for the sickness breaking out so far
 the january 22 nd 1899 farewell wind health of our party has continued good city we began our journey southward
 on friday the 20 th at 11 30 a m and reach the trip to this point was quite exciting
 ed the 9 mile point the brown party cache hut our boat acted very well the river at 3 30
 p m it was our longest haul hut is free of ice we passed through some our loads were not
 heavy yesterday we magnificent scenery the hills run up 4000 made 4 loads each 5 hauling in all 20 to
 5000 feet loads and brought all our goods up from good bye spring city cache 1 ½ below to bring
 our camp to this point we have travelled i have at 26 th may 1899 a miserable day and least
 60 miles loaded and 51 miles light we remained at anchor all day with the in all 111 miles this
 is truly horse work hamilton s andrew and dave hall went but we must get there the weather keeps u
 to the wrecked maggie to try and cold but so far i have escaped frost bites float her and let
 her drift down but their the morning we left mitchell said he would trouble went for nothing as the water
 had probably write us and send letter up with risen so high that it was impossible to indians mitchell did
 not speak to me about reach her from the shore it seems a pity the information andrew gave me although
 that something cannot be saved out of the he is one of the parties in the secret is wreck there
 are two good rifles and a his letter to be the one for us to act shot gun on board
 none here can understand why the owners did not make an 25 th may 1899 did not sleep well last
 attempt to save their goods it seems a night i have felt a little blue of late and case of
 complete discouragement think do not know whether to blame the want what it means not simply a loss of a
 few of sleep for the attack or the reverse dollars worth of goods but eighteen nionths after breakfast this morning
 went out labor practically lost to pick gui n for caulking boat by dinner time we had gathered sufficient and
 henry 27 th may 1899 remained all day at finished the work after dinner we launch anchor the niorning was
 miserable but ed the boat with the assistance of the ham the afternoon turned out fine and we tried ilton
 party who were kind enough to wait to dry out the dunnage belonging to dick several hours to help us
 and then we set felton the hamilton s had several large to work to load and get out we finished
 blankets to dry goods also belonging to about six o clock and then had supper the maggie after which we
 cast loose the hamilton henry erected a tent awning for the party left about two o clock and promised scow

 miles 9 15 distance 10 miles down there is an ice jam or was two days after moving about 2
 ½ miles we sight ago when the report was received and ed a scow ahead of us a wreck and

 yards wide and as this is the dawson width that ogilvie states the stewart is at a party of kiondikers
 prepare to strike camp on the shores of peace river in about 1899 its mouth think that it must be
 the stew under this desire there appears to be on art itself although it appears to be even the part
 of some an eagerness to forge too wide so high up to be this river in ahead it is an
 easy matter to do down the 30 miles travelled yesterday we passed streani to dawson if we are on the
 right only two small rapids the scenery was river but we have not travelled the dismagnificent the whole of yesterday
 s stretch tance we have to see dawson but to get although during the latter part there was gold and
 if we are to get gold we must considerable change in the hills many of look for it them being

 and found nothing but the second time we entered a canyon and about a mile they found prospects at the
 mouth of a down saw a blazed tree and pulled in to mountain stream they went up a short shore
 to see if it was a notice it was one distance so that the colors evidently came left by hopkins
 party and stated that down the stream ed ingraham the miner canyon was o k of the party and a
 man who has done a we continued sailing till it was quite good deal of work on the saskatchewan late

 4 th july 1899 today is the day the while we are living together we are free eagle screams and
 bands play yankee to go our own ways eradicate it one of the worst agricultural pests the russian thistle has
 apparently obtained a fairly firm foothold in lethbridge and vicinity and no one not even the weed inspector appears to
 have been cognizant of the fact until a few days ago it seems to be most firmly established alongside the
 railway tracks and in the neighborhood of six mile coulee this weed got so bad in north dakota that farmers
 could not cut their grain but had to head it horses legs had to be bound around when ploughing and
 the local authorities imposed a heavy fine upon land owners who failed to destroy any that might appear upon their
 property the plant is of the spiney description attains a large size roundish in form and when ripe breaks off
 at the stem is blown by winds over the country and scatters broadcast its innumerable seeds it is up to
 everyone interested in agriculture to work in harmony and energetically in destroying this pest before it gets beyond control railway
 irrigation and town employees should all be made familiar with its appearance and ordered to dig it up whenever found
 and burn it every farmer in self interest alone should do likewise the work of eradication should be commenced at
 once and it should be done thoroughly lethbridge news sept 29 1905 publications available from historical society of alberta men
