 it was successful semi arid plains he was to promote the cause of however the change of route brought settlers
 water management throughout the rest of his life into the semi arid regions of the southern plains in 1883 using
 his authority under the lands resulting in consequences that were far reaching board he had already begun to hold back
 claims although some concern was expressed at that to unclaimed water resources on the plains his time over the difficulties
 settlers would face in purpose was to make these sources available for working the dry lands the belief that other
 rail use by the ranching industry he had come to the lines would be built into the more suitable farm
 conclusion that the most efficient use of the limregions allayed most fears ited water supplies would be made by ranchers
 the construction of the canadian pacific rail the plains seemed ideally suited for cattle which way touched off a land
 boom in the west unfort would range widely over the plains provided unately the boom did not last the hopes
 for they had access to sufficient water supplies he large scale settlement faded as immigration to was opposed to giving
 the limited water supplies north america slowed as a result the govern to settlers because settlers who used only a
 few ment was left with a large inland empire a rail acres of land would not make efficient use of
 the way crossing it but not enough people to fill it it water to him there appeared to be little
 chance was as a result of trying to increase immigration that farming could ever become a viable industry by making
 the west more attractive to settlement he felt that turning water resources over to that the federal government became involved
 farmers would result in more than a few acres of with western waters western land being used in the west
 the drought that began in 1885 was in support of his beliefs he cited as an example to last until

 level the government canals to channel water onto the plains there had no intention of publicizing what was offici was
 not enough people to warrant the heavy ally termed temporary dry conditions expenditure on dams and canals that such a
 scheme required it was not until after 1891 when the likelihood of settlers fleeing their drought stricken lands en opposition
 to his scheme was also voiced by masse became adistinct possibility that the gov officials of the cpr who feared
 that immigrants ernment reversed its stand and began to draft a would avoid the west like the plague if the
 semipolicy designed to aid settlement through a west arid condition of the lands was voiced abroad ern water policy according
 to government and the railway there were thousands of acres of good land that did not the architect of the
 government s irrigation need irrioation which should be settled first policy was william pearce a senior official of the dominion
 lands board as the inspector of dom as the drought lengthened public pressure in inion lands agencies his work had
 taken him on the west forced the government to reverse its p 05 numerous inspection tours throughout the west ition
 on the need to take action to preserve what water resources were available in this the western press led by
 the lethhridge news the medicine hat times the fort maclead gazette and the calgary herald all played a part in
 fostering a growing public demand for government action irrigation meetings and conventions were organized delegations were sent to both the
 federal and territorial governments as well as to the meetings of the international irrigation congress in the united states additional
 support came from the mormoms who had settled on the lethbridge plains they had experience in irrigation and it was
 their knowledge of the techniques as well as the proof that irrigation was profitable that convinced the officials of the
 department of the interior that irrigation could work faced by a growing public demand for action the government asked pearce
 to draft recommendations for government involvements with western water development pearce s ideas were to become the basis of the
 northwest irrigation act of 1894 he had long been a student of water development programs in other parts of the
 world and his recommendations were made with the full knowledge of what had worked in other countries and what had
 not of particular value was the work of major john w powell of the united states geological survey powell had
 undertaken to locate the sites of potential water reservoirs dams and canal routes on the american plains powell proposed developing
 water management programs on a river basin basis this would provide for maximum water use throughout the length of the
 rivers and streams however this could only be william pearce about 1905 and all other needs the third within each
 of the general categories applications for use were dealt with on a priority basis dependent on the date of application
 each claim was to be met in full before other grants would be considered claims were not to be granted
 where there was a danger of overtax ing a stream or where future domestic needs could be placed in jeopardy
 water rights were to be held in perpetuity except in the case of waste improper use or abandonment of a
 claim when the rights were immediately forfeited to the crown without recourse to the courts there were however prior claims
 to water rights within the territories these were of two achieved through centralized control of water reservoirs powell also pressed
 the american government to construct dams reservoirs and canals as public works on the grounds that they would benefit all
 and that the individual irrigator or company would not have the financial resources to do so the thread of powell
 s ideas can be seen running through pearce s proposals the basic principle of the irrigation act was the abrogation
 of all riparian rights to water and the centralized control and regulation of subsequent water use under the act all
 water not already acquired by act of parliament whether found in rivers streams lakes watercourses creeks ravines lagoons canyons swamps
 marshes or other bodies of water was declared to be the property of the crown the act recognized the right
 to water useage under three general priorities domestic industrial and all other needs domestic purposes included household sanitary needs and
 watering of stock the operation of railways stream factories and irrigation formed the second category k ids small irrigation companies
 had already been chartered by the federal government for stream diversion their operations were supervised by government inspection and could
 ea ily fit under the act the other type was of the nature of riparian rights claims by a few
 settlers as the settlers rights to water for domestic purposes were not only recognized within the act but given priority
 over all new demands their position was secure it merely remained for the settlers and the irrigation companies to file
 a registration claim and to bring their operations under the requirements of the legislation in order to make a proper
 division of the waters it was essential to ascertain projections of present and future needs as well as the ability
 of the water supplies to serve these needs to the century the railway was still millions of acres accomplish this
 the act provided for an extensive short of claiming lands it considered fairly fit for inventory of useable water supplies
 in the west settlement in order to close out the land grant and the location of all lands within the
 ten i the railway agreed to accept the remainder of its tories that could benefit from and were capable land

 the railway hoped be established to coordinate this work the end to sell off the improved land and attract new
 setresult was seen as a comprehensive scheme de tiers through irrigation as part of this agreement signed to make possible
 the ultimate conversion the railway accepted an extensive block of land of the arid lands into a rich productive and

 government took it checkered affair initially the railway s irrigaupon itself to regulate the use of western waters tion system

 was committed to undertake an inventory induce settlement however difficulties began to of the scarce resource and to prepare schemes
 develop after 1910 when many of the settlers that would bring about maximum effectiveness claimed their lands were not suitable
 for irrigaof water management schemes thus the govern lion due to either a sandy bottom which permitted ment took upon
 itself ownership regulatory and the water to seep away or because of a clay bottom promotional roles in regard to
 the use of western which retained the water and through a leeching water of the salts within the soils had
 a tendency to form one of the effects of government planning was alkaline flats still others claimed their elevations were
 too high for gravity flow as a result a rea comprehensive proposal known as the north classification was carried out
 by government sur saskatchewan diversion scheme or commonly referred to as the pearce plan this plan envis veyors with a
 subsequent reduction in designated irrigable lands of upwards of 20 percent aged the diversion of flood waters and spring this
 resulted in a serious financial loss to the run off from the north saskatchewan river system onto the southern plains

 it did not look small ditches and began irrigating their fields as if the montana scheme would be put into

 was considered finsibilities of irrigated agriculture were first ancially feasible by american authorities pointed out by william pearce the department
 prompted by this news pearce suggested that the of the interior s superintendent of mines in the canadian government should
 assist the develop north west territories after 1885 however the ment of irrigation in southern alberta either by actual introduction
 of irrigation to the lethbridge direct financial aid to canadian irrigation complain was left to private initiative in particular to
 panics or by undertaking the surveys needed to the mormons who began settling in the region in locate irrigation dams
 and canals pearce had 1887 it was these refugees from american anti assumed that the establishment of a so called
 bigamy laws that started digging irrigation prior claims the waters of the st mary in ditches in 1889 two years
 later they committed canada would deprive the americans of the right themselves to a much larger scheme the intro to
 go ahead with their diversion scheme further duction of water to a tract of land over half a upstream million
 acres in size rented from the alberta pearce s view was not shared by everyone in railway and coal company
 but the undertaking canadian government circles the officials of the ran into difficulties and it was not until a change
 department of justice in ottawa believed that in in ottawa s approach to the problem of irrigation the absence of
 any international law governing that the mormons reclamation projects could be diversions of water flowing across national realized boundaries there
 was no way of preventing the in july of 1894 the north west irrigation act planned diversion in montana in
 their opinion was passed by the federal government and active the establishment of ‘ prior claims or vested financial support
 for irrigation schemes com rights on the canadian side of the boundary menced during the following year the reason could
 at best only ‘ add strength to ottawa s for ottawa s policy was partly because of a budding dispute
 with the united states concern the author on staff of the royal military college of ing irrigation along the alberta
 montana bound canada kingston ont presented this paper to the i ary i annual meeting of the historical society of
 alberta in i the origins of the dispute can be traced to the lethbnidge last year i american west the
 same year also saw the creation of the united states reclamation service whose officers soon visited montana and concluded that
 the proposed milk river diversion scheme was feasible especially since the water flowing through the canadian portion of the river
 could not be used for irrigation there in canada a solution to the problem was proposed by john s dennis
 chief inspector of surveys who had just investigated the milk river region dennis told clifford sifton the minister of the
 interior that if the americans diverted the st mary into the milk river the canadians should and could take those
 waters out of the milk and use them for irrigation in canada dennis urged sifton to give encouragement to the
 canadian north west irrigation company cnwic to start an irrigation project in the area less than two months later the
 cnwic was authorized to go ahead with the construction of a diversion canal from the milk river at the same
 time ottawa also protested the planned montana diversion in washington in 1903 the cnwic s milk river canal was completed
 south of the border preparations for the st mary diversion scheme continued but construction work was not started alarmed by
 the canadian action montana interests made arguments in any negotiations with washington this view was basically shared by sir john
 thompson the prime minister nevertheless pearce s advice was adopted and orders were sent to government surveyors in alberta to
 locate a canal which was to carry the waters of the st mary to farms on the lethbridge plains the
 surveys were done in 1895 work on the st mary canal was started in 1898 and the canal was completed
 two years later in the meantime the government had given additional incentives to the alberta irrigation company in order to
 promote irrigated agriculture in the district unfortunately for canada no amount of government aid to irrigation in southern alberta could
 avert the threat that the planned montana project posed to irrigated agriculture in alberta the establishing of prior claims was
 an effective instrument in certain types of municipal law only and had no bearing on international situations no measure could
 prevent americans from using waters in their own territory as they pleased and the administration in washington was fully aware
 of american s sovereign rights they had explicitly expressed these in their quarrels with mexico over the uses of the
 waters of the rio grande the only way to protect canadian interests along the st mary river was to negotiate
 an agreement with the united states indeed the canadian government made an attempt to start negotiations with washington in this
 matter early in 1896 but the american government proved cool to the idea in 1902 the montana plan got a
 shot in the arm with the passing by congress of the reclamation act this measure provided public funds for the
 construction of irrigation projects in the complaints in washington the american administration in turn launched a complaint with the british
 embassy in washington elsewhere in washington officials started to realize that the montana diversion could not be put into effect
 without the agreement of canada late in 1904 the st mary and milk controversy erupted into a diplomatic quarrel when
 u s secretary of state john hay delivered a stiff worded protest to the british ambassador hay claimed that the
 authorization of the diversion from the milk river in canada was an act lacking in friendlyness and called for discussions
 between representatives of the two governments hay also told the british ambassador that if the issue could not be solved
 to the satisfaction of his government a way would be found to divert the st mary s waters into the
 lower milk river through united states territor y in june of 1905 representatives of the two governments met and reached
 a tentative agreement for the settlement of the issue it was also decided that the officials of the u s
 reclamation service should draft the text of a treaty which could be submitted to the two governments for consideration the
 draft agreement was drawn up but it was not presented to ottawa until two years later the delay was not
 caused by the experts of the reclamation service but by the american administration which for a long time insisted on
 finding a way of using the st mary s tion and increased once work began a p waters for irrigation

 that during the irrigation season the governments his proposal was accepted and waters of this system should be apportioned bet

 canadian government lacked both system by the united states experts and the necessary infirmation to carry on now it was
 the canadian government s turn to these negotiations one official of the departdelay sir wilfrid launier was opposed to the
 idea ment of the interior complained at the time that ofaseparate tt eaty regarding the st mary and the there
 was no one in canada with a thorough milk issue he firmly believed that all matters training in the law
 and practice of irrigation relating to boundary waters should be treated in to assist king george g anderson an amenone
 general tteaty and should come under the pun can irrigation engineer was hired and was asked view of a single
 permanent canadian american to prepare a detailed study of the whole controcommission frank oliver the minister of the versy apparently
 anderson s scottish back interior after sifton s departure from the cabinet ground and his connections north of the border
 held that the recognition by canada of the claims he had been a consulting engineer for the of the montana
 settlers to the waters of the milk cnwic for years helped to allay the distrust the would leave canadians no
 water from that officials of the department often had for source and that the concession asked of canada americans to
 allow a large volume of water down that river king and newell made very slow progress was unreasonable the officials
 of the depart first they insisted on a tour of the area in quesment of the interior had still other
 objections tion further delay was caused by king s inability they felt that in view of the fact that more
 land to master the complexities of the case almost a could be irrigated in the canadian part of the st
 month after his appointment for example king mary and milk drainage system the proposal for could still write that he
 had entirely misequal division of waters was unfair to canada understood some aspects of root s proposals they also wanted
 the u s to assume responsib of june 1907 and comprehended them only ility for damages in canada resulting from
 a pos after newell had painstakingly gone over them sible bursting of the dams on the american stretch with him
 7 the greatest problem facing king and of the st mary taking these views into consid the canadian department of
 the interior was eration the canadian cabinet rejected the draft that until they had anderson s report in hand treaty
 and had its decision communicated to they were in no position to make any proposals in washington through the usual
 diplomatic chan the negotiations nels anderson s study was submitted toward the meanwhile work on the irrigation projects end of
 april it contained a number of important continued on both sides of the boundary despite observations and recommendations anderson the
 fact that their feasibility was still being ques concluded that canada had as clear a legal tioned especially in the
 united states there the claim to the waters of the two rivers as had the experts doubts had predated the
 start ofconstruc united states he pointed out that the diplomatic correspondence as well as some of the state waters down
 the canadian section of the milk ments of american officials indicated that the river but asked that the u s
 should be respon united states government favoured the applica sible for the proper control of them while they tion of

 did not acknowledge king s proposals can plans for the utilization of the waters of the until the end of
 september he had been sent to st mary river he concluded that the only feas hawaii to take part in
 a stocktaking of that isible one was the milk river project the scheme land s natural resources in fact it
 was from which involved the conveyance of the waters honolulu that he sent king a long outline of his through
 the canadian stretch of that river own ideas on the st mary and milk rivers contro anderson also commented on
 root s draft con versy newell s review implied that canada had vention of june 1907 in general he was
 critical been the aggressor since she had granted of its ambiguous and misleading lang rights to the waters of the
 milk river when those uage he also pointed out that a few of its waters had already been appropriated by
 montana provisions were incompatible with the principle citizens downstream he described root s propoof equal division and deplored the refusal
 of the sals ofjune 1907 as being extremely liberal united states to assume responsibility for the and warned that any
 proposal to give canada damages that could arise from a large volume of more than half the water could not
 be enterwater being allowed to pass through the channel tamed next he refuted many of the arguments of the milk

 negotiators were not familiar some of the aims that had been sought by king and anderson the clause s second
 paragraph assured the were lost sight of and were not incorporated in united states the use of the canadian stretch
 of the final adjustment of the st mary and milk the milk river to convey waters from the st issue
 this fact caused many second thoughts in mary reservoirs to the lower milk river valley the third and last paragraph
 provided for the ottawa later and almost led to the abandonment of the entire settlement on boundary waters measurement and
 apportionment of the water to be used by the officers of the u s discussions concerning a general boundary reclamation
 service and canadian irrigation waters treaty had started in earnest in 1907 and came to a climax at the end
 of 1908 in their final experts under the direction of the agency established by the boundary waters treaty the phase
 the negotiations were conducted by international joint commission george c gibbons later sir george gibbons and chandler p anderson the
 former was a although article vi was a part of a general lawyer and liberal organizer from london ont boundary
 waters settlement it was really a treaty the latter was a state department legal expert within a treaty it dealt
 with a situation quite un neither knew anything about irrigation law on like those touched upon by the other articles
 conditions on the canadian american irrigation and had not been drafted by the same people who frontier nevertheless they were
 instructed by fathered the rest of the treaty nor did it receive their respective governments to incorporate into the meticulous
 care that had been accorded to their draft treaty a clause dealing with the st many other parts of the
 general settlement it is mary and milk rivers controversy to assist in not unfair to say that article vi had
 been drafted the wording of this clause rh campbell an in great haste and contained numerous weakofficial of the canadian
 department of the nesses this latter fact did not become obvious interior accompanied gibbons to washington until years after 1909
 this was post election time in the american the fact that article vi escaped attention capital and gibbons believed that
 if the treaty during the prolonged debates about the boundcould not be signed while the outgoing adminis any waters treaty
 in canadian government tration was still in power it would never be circles during the late winter of 1909 was
 partly accepted therefore he wished to avoid any the fault of gibbons the wily old lawyer prodelay in the negotiations
 and refused to support bably did not feel sufficiently informed about the campbell in his arguments with the americans problem
 to handle it with confidence perhaps he frustrated by this turn of events campbell re suspected that something was amiss
 but remainquested his recall from washington to replace ed silent in a long memorandum which he prehim king and william
 pugsley the minister of pared for the government about the treaty he public works were sent to the american capital
 studiously avoided an analysis of the clause the it was they who along with the american nego treaty was recommended
 to the cabinet by a b tiators agreed upon the final draft of the st m ii y aylesworth the
 minister of justice unfortand milk clause the draft was telegraphed to unately aylesworth failed to make an independ ottawa where
 the cabinet accepted it with only a ent assessment of the settlement but relied few minor amendments the boundary waters
 heavily on gibbons study in writing his own treaty was signed in washington on jan ii submission the predictable result
 was that 1909 with it supposedly the st mary and article vi once again escaped scrutiny laurien milk irrigation controversy
 was settled who had a very keen interest in some parts of this article vi of the treaty stipulated that
 the st treaty was among those who remained poorly mary and milk rivers and their tributaries informed about the clause
 this fact had serious were to be treated as one stream for the purposes repercussions including a very long delay
 in the of irrigation and that their waters should be ap treaty s ratification portioned equally between the two countries
 in in may of 1909 article vi finally received a making such division however one country bit of attention in
 the house of commons on the value of irrigation to alberta s arid regions was shown in this vegetable display
 at bow island in 1910 this occasion launier rose to defend the treaty s son s statement made nathercasually that
 the st provisions regarding the st mary and milk mary s floodwaters could not be stored in cana rivers issue
 sir wilfrid proclaimed that the dian territory and that the treaty did not provide agreement would provide for the storage
 of the for their storage in the reservoirs planned in st mary s floodwaters in american reservoirs montana 5 and
 farms in southern alberta would be supplied the canadian cabinet found itself in an embarwith water during the whole summer
 rassing position launier had promised some no one knew at the time that launier being thing in the house which
 the treaty was not going misinformed about article vi had been incorrect to do the problem had to be ironed
 out some it was only in july just as the cabinet finally pre how for the purpose pugsley and king
 were pared to accept the treaty that the article s pro once again sent to washington once there they visions
 began to worry the leaders in ottawa the asked the american government to promise to source of this ‘‘ scare
 was a statement made by make the planned st mary reservoir large george anderson that the st mary and milk
 set enough to store canada s share of the waters as tlement was unfavounable to canada disturbed well alas the
 amercians were in no position to and worried laurier ordered anderson to sub undertake such a comminment and told the
 canastantiate his statement in a detailed report dians so a few weeks after the king pugsley visit anderson completed his
 analysis of article vi the dam they were planning in montana could during the middle of september he concluded not
 store the u s ‘ s half of the water let alone that the agreement benefitted only the united canada
 s but the american officials who seem states he was especially critical of the principle to have been better informed
 about what went on of equal division equal apportionment was in southern alberta then the men in ottawa had unjust
 to canada because it did not take into con good news for the canadian government acsideration four important factors that
 more land cording to their information cpr irrigation survey was available for irrigation north of the boundary crews had just
 discovered a few storage sites than south of it that more prior appropriations along the canadian stretch of the st
 mary had been made in alberta than in montana that indeed a check with the cpr s superintendent of canada
 was not accorded compensation for al irrigation confirmed the news after receiving lowing the united states to use the milk
 riven further assurances from the company s president channel and that she was not assured ‘‘ adequate the cabinet once
 more considered the question of means of redress in case damages arose from the the treaty s acceptance after a
 few more weeks increased flow in that channel all of these were of delay the canadian government finally conserious changes
 nevertheless what seems to have sented to agree to the treaty ratifications were disturbed the leaders in ottawa most was

 the route through the yellowhead pass the photographer horetzky and macoun were completely different in both appearance and temperament the
 photographer was a swarthy giant with a vast black beard while macoun was small wiry and agile horetzky wanted to
 follow a different route from the one they had agreed with fleming he treated macoun with contempt and appeared to
 take full charge ordering luxurious supplies for himself but little for macoun and giving orders to the indian guides in
 french which macoun did not understand after a dangerous and difficult journey they reached fort st james where they parted
 horetzky wanted to get rid of macoun perhaps thinking that he was not fit enough to keep up with him
 in a winter journey through the mountains macoun sensed this and agreed to go south through the mountains to the
 fraser river while horetzky continued westwards towards the coast with two indian guides after a terrible journey through barren mountains
 and snow drifts and short of food he eventually reached victoria on december 12 after this rather prolonged summer vacation
 he heard there that his wife had been delivered of his fifth child despite the privations of this journey macoun
 fell in love with the wilderness and over the next ten years made a number of long and strenuous journeys
 into the north west territories the last two on behalf of the canadian government he published the observations made on
 these journeys in manitoba and the a fellow passenger on the steamer and at each stop he leaped off the
 boat to collect specimens fascinated fleming asked him if he would care to come along with him to the pacific
 macoun readily accepted thus embarking on his close association with the development of the west the secretary of fleming s
 expedition was a presbyterian minister george monro grant who became famous for his book ocean to ocean the account of
 the journey through british territory to the pacific coast charles horetzky joined the party at winnipeg and became the official
 photographer after crossing the lakes by steamer they landed at port arthur and followed the dawson route by wagon to
 lake shebondowan after crossing this and several other lakes by barge or canoes they came to the prairie which stretches
 great north west in 1882 he said in his preface in writing i have had the delight of revisiting in
 imagination many a cheery camp fire and many a scene of vast and lonely beauty on which memory loves of
 dwell and of feeling that i was endeavouning to describe to my fellow countrymen with simplicity and truthfulness a portion
 of that magnificant heritage of which as yet they know so little one wonders what his wife thought of his
 love affair with the wilderness she cannot have had much of his company during their long married life macoun explored
 the huge plain of south saskatchewan and was struck by the fact that some areas bore excellent crops of all
 kinds although just over the border from them was apparent desert he became convinced that the for about 800 miles
 from portage ia prairie to edmonton macoun was delighted with the prairie where numerous species new to him grew in
 sheets of bnillant colour fleming decided that they should travel at least 40 miles a day and actually measured the
 distance travelled by a milometer attached to one of the carts they found out as much as possible about the
 route ahead by studying accounts by earlier travellers the party split up at fort edmonton so that macoun and horetzky
 could follow the peace explanation of this was that before the earth was broken up by cultivation the rain was

 this week james l taylor of taylorville sent his youngest son george out in quest of some beef steers which
 had strayed away from the range the boy found them on the other side of the international boundary line and
 headed them for his father s place en route thereto and before he had re crossed the boundary he was
 accosted by a man who endeavoured to make him veto his action by taking just a few shots at him
 the bullets whizzed in dangerous proximity a nd one of the deadly missiles punctured the crown of his head gear
 the lad determined to return with the cattle or leave his bones for the prowling coyote and he pushed on
 in the direction oftaylorville he reported his encounter to his father who at once dispatched the news by a messenger
 to inspector irwin at this point the police communicated the news by wire to the authorities across the line this
 was on u s soil on tuesday evening the boy was out on the range again and caught the man
 driving off the steers the fellow opened fire on him and the boy returned to the house this was on
 canadian soil between amassa parker s and the boundary line about one hundred yards from the latter early yesterday morning
 young taylor armed himself with a revolver and headed for the scene of the previous night s affray he wanted
 to be equal to the emergency as heretofore all the shooting had come from the weapon of his adversary he
 found the man in charge of the steers just across the jine and as he approached the fellow looked around
 and seeing him at once opened fire without ever a word passing between them the man fired a couple of
 shots before the boy could get in readiness for a return volley one of the shots went through his coat
 which was being flapped by the breeze taylor fired and just as he did a bullet struck him in the
 fore part of the foot at this moment the man left the cattle and went speeding away into montana and
 the boy returned home the wound in his foot being very painful with his mother and brother the boy arrived
 in cardston yesterday afternoon and the doctor at once went to work on the foot and extracted the bullet the
 police were again notified of the shooting and a complete statement was obtained from the boy george is only a
 boy of about sixteen years of age but he shows forth the pluck of an old soldier nd the grit

 in 903 the great falls tribune carried the following attack on settlement in alberta by american farmers in almost every
 town in southern alberta little groups of discouraged men daily stand upon the street corners cursing canada and ea rnestly
 wishing that they were back in the united states declares joe blain formerly a farmer of the black butte district
 who returned yesterday after two years of vain striving to make a living as a farmer in the vicinity of
 cardston hundreds of men who have gone into that country from the united states are coming back continued mr blame
 a nd after next fall s crops shall have been gathered if there re any thousands will return to uncle
 sam s domain the return movement has already commenced in northern alberta and i have no doubt that within three
 years 90 per cent of the people who have gone from the united states to the country more than 100
 miles north of the boundary will have returned while very few of those who have settled in southern alberta aside
 from the mormons will remain there i farmed in cascade county for twelve years including the terribly dy years of
 1889 and 1890 and i had only a ‘ bench nd farm i thought i had not done well and
 i concluded to go to canada but never again will i leave montana the crops in cascade county in 1889
 and 1890 were better than the best ever raised in alberta to secure my land in that country i swallowed
 every shred of pride and declred my allegience to a king and emperor i sold my 320 acres of land
 for 200 and have come back to montana a ma n without a country and without a farm but i
 shall secure 160 of cascade county land and again become a citizen of the united states never more to renounce
 my allegiance a mormom may live in southern alberta the utah farmers have learned to struggle against great disadvantages and
 to suffer for the sake of their religion but no other man can or will do it and the ordinary
 farmer can do better financially and be much happier on 80 acres of cascade country land that on 320 acres
 of land in alberta for the last three years there have been utter failures of crops in all the district
 100 miles or more north of the line a nd in southern alberta the crops have been poor hailstones as
 large as my fist frosts as late as july 15 floods in june and snow in august are almost normal
 conditions in that country thus far this year except in a narrow strip of territor y extending not much north
 of lethbridge no grain has been sown the climatic conditions being ver y bad many of the farmers are utterly
 discouraged and while it is now too late for them to leave they will pull out of that section early
 in the fall and many will come into northern montana social conditions are bad the people are not congenial the
 mormons are in the saddle the schools are poor and few and there is an utter lack of progressiveness one
 of my first acts upon arriving in great falls was to order a beef steak at a restaurant i could
 not get one fit to eat in an alberta restaurant and in many other little things there is such a
 difference between alberta and montana recently prairie fires have caused great loss in that country several outfits have lost all
 their range and much hay have been destroyed this was the last straw and i came back to montana to
 stay i shall leave in the morning to locate a ranch near black butte but i will be in great

 design altoto the west end of lesser slave lake with gether than the midnight sun where the sun horses and
 wagons he hauled the big stea m boiler was driven by a paddle wheel mounted at the and other necessary

 ca rpenters either side each was driven by a sepa rate nd boat builders he set to work to build
 a luxury engine paddle wheel driven riverboat it was 120 feet in barber never gave up on his dream that
 a length and 26 feet across the beam it had state steamboat could operate from athabasca landrooms for 35 passengers
 with additional room ing straight through to grouard like the midfor 50 tons of freight the big steam engine night

 pass on to british columbia do the kootenay and on to the coast but after okotoks and high river the
 company disbanded the company was billed for okotoks on tuesday and wednesday last and for high river on thursday and
 friday the irregular train service prevented the launching of the company on tuesday and they decided to start out from
 calgary on foot on wednesday afternoon the company included cf hicklin manager l r beno d beno w c smith

 started for high river which after much trouble and var ious maladventures they reached at 6 45 am friday morning
 they advertised their show and began the performance at 8 30 then came the climax of all the hard luck
 the house was not good but not ver y poor as the receipts were 1 1 50 but there were
 eggs in the audience the first flight of eggs came at the close of the curtain raiser the curtain raiser
 proved to be a curtain dropper and the pathetic finish of the minstrel trio is unknown to high river theatrical
 devotees the curtain was down a bit longer than the audience thought good and a committee came on to interview
 the company and learn what they intended to do the company intended to proceed with the show and they did
 proceed the first two acts were fairly successful the second shower of eggs began at the close of the third
 act but the artists persisted and the play was concluded the audience was anxious to hear the company sing god
 save the king the curtain was raised for that purpose and as the members of the company came forward they
 ran into a volley of eggs chas hicklin a director of the company resented this picked up a club and
 made an assault upon the audience flinging the missle in the midst of the audience this displeased the spactators and
 they at once gave chase to hicklin they swarmed over the stage and generally made rough house hicklin made his
 escape through a window and there was a sound of revel ry in high river for a time mr hicklin
 decided to leave high river shortly after and shook the mud of the town from his feet at 2 a
