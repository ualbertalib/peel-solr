 5 editor s page the editor of the patrician 1967 comprehensibly outlined what was in store for the latter part 
 of 1968 the regimental depot was disbanded and ceased to function on the 31st of october the residual element he 
 referred to finally came out of the clouds as a regimental increment with a capt lt sgt clk adm and 
 a cpl clk adm this increment is charged with the handling of regimental matters the first battalion returned from cyprus 
 and moved into currie barracks calgary alberta which has been officially designated as the home station the head office of 
 the association the regimental museum the patrician the kit shop etc are all functioning in currie barracks the move of 
 the increment and all it s cumbersome bits and pieces was made with the excellent assistance of maj fl berry 
 cd and his rear party from the first battalion your editor also wishes to make public the outstanding co operation 
 we were afforded by the qor of c depot commander and his staff during the actual phasing into accommodations in 
 currie barracks it is with regret that our readers will note the absence of two reports that normally appear each 
 year in the patrician it is intended that our journal be published as early in the year as possible it 
 is emphasized again that articles for publication unit and branch reports and letters to the editor for the patrician 1969 
 must arrive at the home station by 31 january 1970 as this is written the regimental museum is approaching final 
 completion the last portion to be worked up is the weapons room when all is completed we feel it will 
 be eye appealing and depict the history of the regiment as best it can be depicted the original museum opened 
 in 1954 was the pride and joy of its custodian rsm o gardner time has come full cycle bill gardner 
 worked for six weeks to start the layout of the present museum we would like to acknowledge that the opening 
 of the museum would still be in the future if it had not been for his excellent assistance and knowledge 
 bill has once again shown his love of regiment and undying allegiance to what it stands for the museum is 
 open during all normal working hours and may be opened at most any other time by contacting the regimental adjutant 
 it has been my honour and privilege on a number of occasions during the past year to have been contacted 
 by ex patricias travelling about the country to take them through the museum is a never ending source of interest 
 and pleasure it is hoped that no patricia ever passes through calgary without contacting the home station this year s 
 edition has a section devoted to the end of the first world war and the 50th anniversary of the signing 
 of the armistice on the 11th of november 1918 the colonel of the regiment was advised in august that two 
 ceremonies were planned to mark the 50th anniversary and were to be sponsored by the department of veterans affairs the 
 membership of the association was scrutinized 0:scru 0:tinized and two men selected as representatives who were on strength of the 
 regiment at the time of and during the closing battle the regiment took part in this was the battle and 
 subsequent liberation of mons mr p howard ferguson mm 411018 of the ottawa branch represented the regiment at the numerous

 periodically and drop a letter to the home station let us know where you are what you are doing if

 the ppcli hamilton gault barracks edmonton alberta dear sir kindly allow me a little of your valued time and space 
 i have been reading the legionary ppcli history i was a member of the royal canadian 0:cana 0:dian regiment from 
 1914 to 1919 my first time to the trenches in france was with the ppcli and on that occasion our 
 engineers discharged a mine and of course the objective was to take the crater for positional purposes the objective was 
 successful after a period we were all as one and we fought as canadian brothers you will find enclosed mv 
 letter to the late mayor of taunton mr goodman whom i regret has since passed to the great beyond i 
 had tea with him in his parlour and later he wrote me a letter in which he remarked mr blatchford 
 0:blatch 0:ford a friend of brig general hamilton gault will always be a friend of mine i did regard his 
 compliment as a tribute to one of the greatest ever canadian soldiers you will note in mv letter my sentiments 
 0:senti 0:ments referring to the battle in which the brigadier lost his leg the battle of hooge and sanctuary wood 
 was one i shall never forget on june 2nd 1916 the german artillery opened a terrific barrage on our positions 
 and a lot of my buddies being killed and wounded my buddies stephen gough who lives at st marys ontario 
 and charlie millington who lives at 59 glengary aye toronto saw the germans going down through the sanctuary 0:sanc 0:tuary 
 wood shouted look blatch they were going down in a mass we all opened our fire and we saw them 
 falling and scrambling over each other and we soon piled them up our ross rifles got so hot we burned 
 the skin off our hands but believe me sir we stopped their gallop 0:gal 0:lop and our pals the ppcli 
 was ever grateful as we as always were a great team col farquar as you know was killed also general 
 mercer but my saddest moment was when we had our roll call and later the parade of our brigade the 
 rcr ppcli the 42nd highlanders and the 49th edmonton regiment to receive the praise and gratitude 0:grat 0:itude of brigadier 
 general macdonald those present will never forget this occasion 0:oc 0:casion as he had become so full of words he 
 completely broke down and indeed wept we went in and out of the front line continuously and never let each 
 other down i often read of their duties in germany and i feel proud i was at courcellete also vimy 
 ridge hill 70 then paschendaelle so you can imagine i know france very well in war i was gassed and 
 paschendalle was where i got my knockout i was going in and out of hospital for 7 years and am 
 still an 86 life pensioner i am enclosing my war record which my regiment the royal canadian regiment 0:reg 0:iment 
 has on record at london ontario i must tell you i still write to charlie and stephen and my life 
 would end if i should forget them i must mention poor charlie millington had with others an awful night being 
 a front line runner my duties was to go the rounds on this night we had a lot of wounded 
 and after my third round poor charlie said for christs sake blatch get us out of here or else i 
 shall die but believe me sir i got them all out 20 of mv pals before we went to hooge 
 i was voted by my buddies the m m but we had a stalwart pte ship he was good and 
 faithful so i said you have it robbie and that was the last of robbie 0:rob 0:bie for he returned 
 to canada i must mention our cpl mathieson wally asked for a volunteer as we had run out of mills 
 bombs no volunteers reg you are the front line runner and i went crawled to h q and returned with 
 6 
 8 bags of mills no 5 well dear sir i will conclude but let me have your comments 0:com 0:ments

 valued time on wednesday 13th february i read with interest the presentation made by mrs hamilton gault the ceremony taking 
 place at a meeting of the borough council may i mr mayor be allowed to mention 0:men 0:tion the love 
 and affection his regiment held for him i was a member of the royal canadian begiment the princess patricia s 
 canadian light infantry and my regiment always did duty together in the trenches and i would like to mention how 
 i became acquainted with the gallant 0:gal 0:lant brig andrew hamilton gault on june 2nd 1916 we were holding positions 
 at ypres my regiment at hooge the ppcli in sanctuary wood precisely at 9 00 a m the germans started 
 to bombard 0:bom 0:bard and shell every position destroying all communications i mr mayor was a front line runner and 
 it was at this time mv knowledge of the action was first hand we suffered terrible casualties as did the 
 princess patricia s i had to travel over no man s land to ascertain how the princess patricia s were 
 situated they had previously lost lt col farquahr when brig hamilton gault took over command i was amazed to find 
 brig hamilton gault laying there on a stretcher 0:stret 0:cher fully conscious directing his men and absolutely refusing to leave 
 finally the medical officer had to administer injections and it was then that i myself directed them overland to the 
 medical station the astonishing part of all being the fact that i have never made contact with brig hamilton gault 
 from that morning or never yet i have been to taunton hundreds upon hundreds of occasions i must mention i 
 did have tea with mrs hamilton gault about 8 months past and believe me mr mayor she was delighted you 
 know mr mayor there is one man whom i know should have received the victoria cross for bravery and devotion 
 to duty that personality was none other than brig andrew hamilton gault you see mr mayor i was the only 
 person outside of his regiment present 0:pre 0:sent what a thousand pities i had not gone to my own commanding 
 officer may i in conclusion mr mayor wish you every success in your term of office i remain sir your

 get out of bed it was later that i learnt that our regts in 7th brigade had taken mons yours

 battalion i was not an original but was transferred 0:trans 0:ferred from no 2 company to the band after we 
 came out of the line at st hilare i was called into company hq by capt ten brooke and asked 
 to transfer to the band as they had received some casualties while bringing up rations and would i help them 
 out i have forgotten the majority of those names and those i knew personally in ottawa have all passed on

 are my recollections of the christmas dinner on the troopship in december 1939 which a great many patricians will remember 
 as a memorable christmas dinner by d f parrott p 22271 at the outbreak of hostilities in september 0:sep 0:tember 
 1939 the regiment was brought to full strength assembled in winnipeg then arrived in halifax on december 18th we had 
 to stay on the troop train for two days at pier 22 the french battle ships dunkerque and la gloire 
 were berthed at piers 23 and 24 some patricias who spoke french were given a tour of these ships our 
 troopship the orma a former british passenger liner on the australian run was doing its first duty in troop transportation 
 0:trans 0:portation we were assigned excellent berths with two men to a room and a steward in attendance the convoy 
 sailed from halifax harbor on december 22nd our position being to the right of the british battleship revenge and to 
 the rear of the polish 
 11 ship chobry which we learned was carrying the west nova scotia regiment by reading the morse code signals being 
 flashed from ship to ship by signal lamp the weather was reasonably pleasant for the first three days and at 
 noon on christmas day we were served a lovely christmas dinner for very likely the first time that the regiment 
 had been all together in one place since the end of the first world war the next day a gale 
 came up bringing twenty to thirty foot waves the two forward triple turrets of the revenge s sixteen inch naval 
 guns would be completely 0:com 0:pletely covered by each wave the greygreen 0:grey 0:green sea water would cascade off the 
 deck as the trough was reached then the forward deck and gun turrets would plunge into the next wave our 
 ship was much higher out of the water which caused a pronounced roll sideways as well as plunging into the 
 trough of each gigantic wave this gale force wind had subsided slightly before we sighted the coast of ireland on 
 the evening of december 0:decem 0:ber 29th and early the next morning the vivid green hills of the clyde river 
 banks were a beautiful sight as we steamed slowly into the harbor of greenock scotland 0:scot 0:land as a great 
 many of us had suffered various stages of sea sickness and i distinctly remember the greenock station platform seemed to 
 keep gently rolling like slow sea swells as we were getting on the troop train about dusk on december 0:decem 
 0:ber 30th early next morning we arrived at farnborough station near aldershot we were met at the station by brigadier 
 g r pearkes and the founder lt col hamilton gault we formed up in column of route and the general 
 officer of the aldershot command took the salute we inarched a mile or so to morval barracks in cove hampshire 
 where we found sgt bob deegan of the advance party rushing around with some portable kerosene stoves as the steam 
 and water pipes in the barracks had frozen the day before arrival during the next two days we got the 
 pipes and ourselves thawed out then we were given five days landing leave in london sgt bob deegan carrier platoon 
 h q coy missed that lovely christmas dinner on board our troopship but he had the distinction 0:dis 0:tinction of 
 being the first patricia to land in britain in the second world war as he was the first man off 
 the ship when the advance party under captain c b ware landed in greenock scotland on december 0:decem 0:ber 18th 
 1939 the regiment were probably 0:pro 0:bably not able to be together again in one place to have christmas dinner

 note the following is the article mr stephens mentions in the foregoing 0:fore 0:going letter lt appeared in the oakville 
 beaver on thursday may 9 1968 mademoiselle from and all that there was no music at the annual and forty 
 ninth regimental dinner of the princess patricia s canadian light infantry 0:infan 0:try association held last saturday night in the 
 mayfair room of the king edward hotel in toronto and no one sang even one verse of the eighty eight 
 odd colorful and unprintable chapters in the regimental anthem the bic a dam doo even the unrivalled regimental march comprised 
 of has anyone seen the colonel he s lying on the canteen floor mademoiselle from armentieres and it s a 
 long way to tipperary remained silent and still there was just no band that s all there were youngsters from 
 the first world war a few from the second bash and several of the korean campaign the quiet was in 
 which the pats were the only canadian regiment to receive the u s presidential citation a smattering of old sergeants 
 a couple of colonels a brigadier 0:brig 0:adier some trusty privates and one bloddy bandsman this regiment was formed during 
 the first war and on may 28 1916 the ppcli comedy company was created from several musicians and artists in 
 the front line unit they gave their first concert 0:con 0:cert in the townhall of steenboorde on june 18 1916 
 and so was born the ppcli musical heritage they carried on as a regimental show until july 1917 when along 
 with other frontline entertainers they established what became internationally known as the dumbells in between the two wars the tradition 
 of music was further enhanced by the famous princess pats band under the astute 0:as 0:tute leadership of captain tommy 
 james who led his musicians to world wide recognition in the twenties and early thirties about the end of that 
 era i came along regimental number p 22191 bandsman for the use of stephens wr with the outbreak of the 
 second issue bands of course were found to be unnecessary 0:un 0:necessary and the younger members were dispersed to various 
 essential army duties such as stretcher bearers clerks and waterboys and went overseas with the first contingent in 1939 by 
 destroying the then famous pats band the strength of the overseas canadian army was increased by 15 several years later 
 however canada sent over one lt l streeter known as the great white chief who quickly formed divisional bands for 
 the canadian army in england lt streeter was ppcli and most of the first band formed were members of the 
 ppcli after the era in 1949 the pats band was again established in calgary under the leadership of capt a 
 brown who first learned to play trombone in the oakville citizens band and who is now commanding the service bands 
 for canada from ottawa in 1953 capt f mcleod assumed command of the now 55 piece ppcli band and it 
 was at the british empire 
 14 games in vancouver 1954 that the first military tattoo emerged this was later enlarged by another pat bandmaster capt 
 h jeffrey who produced the startling 0:start 0:ling tattoo for the world s fair in seattle the musicians of the 
 pats have more than contributed their share to the history of the regiment and also play a very important part 
 in the cultural life of canada only last year the musical circles of edmonton were shocked and alarmed over ottawa 
 s decision to move the ppcli band to another location without the members of the pats band the edmonton 0:ed 
 0:monton symphony orchestra would be forced to close activities and what good is a ric a dam doo without a 
 band w ray stephens 2145 rebecca st oakville ontario december 6 1968 captain yd cole mm cd regimental adjutant ppcli 
 currie barracks calgary 7 alberta dear captain cole i appreciate the form letter concerning the new status of the regiment 
 and regret the depot in edmonton has now been disbanded in particular i am concerned over the possible fate of 
 the regimental brass band as it is generally referred to will the band still exist i realize the moving the 
 band itself has created a musical problem in the city of edmonton and there is feeling in the cultural circles 
 that the edmonton symphony orchestra cannot carry on without the aid of such capable musicians as are in the ppcli 
 band as you can see by the enclosed column of mine i attended one of the last toronto meetings and 
 since i was once a member of the regimental band as of april 1936 i had the urge to write 
 accordingly several years ago i had the pleasure of quietly visiting the regimental museum 0:mu 0:seum at the edmonton depot 
 and i was more than impressed i even sent major stutt a clipping or two from mv old scrap book 
 this museum is a must and i am pleased to see that it will carry on under your supervision now 
 that it will be in calgary i do trust that ex sgt major bill gardner might become actively involved in 
 the museum which i am led to believe was an original of his i am also enclosing part of a 
 brochure prepared by mv music company on john the band of princess patricia s canadian light infantry circa 1937 fort 
 osborne barracks winnipeg the following have been identified by mr wr stephens the drum major l cpl whj stutt now 
 retired as a major others in a general left to right order are stephens macdonald behind him crawford mckeever behind 
 him mercer and the near file from front to rear tigertwood britten grant morris keeler baldrey 
 15 kirby who is one of canada s leading music educators it was john who actually created my renewed interest 
 in the association although 0:al 0:though he is a veteran of the first war patricias i mention these points as 
 general 0:gen 0:eral interest for i feel that it is important that all previous members of all ages become involved 
 in the preservation of the regiment and the associations as a token of my consideration i am also enclosing a 
 snap of the patricias lined up for a parade with the band in front i am the bass player to 
 the left of the picture or on the right side facing front this was taken in fort orborne barracks winnipeg 
 and the rooms above the band are the actual bandrooms of that period notice that the lance corporal 0:lance 0:cor 
 0:poral in front acting as drum major is bill stutt i think this must have been in 1937 or 1938 
 this was the time when the regiment marched four abreast and the front line all topped 6 foot 5 inches 
 stutt being 6 ft 6 or something and colonel colquhoun having about halfinch 0:half 0:inch above that i have treasured 
 this snap so hope it can find a place in the 1937 era finally i notice in the 1967 vp 
 under the toronto branch that i have been given a strange number h 182250 my regimental number is p 22191 
 best regards and good luck ray stephens 110 park road toronto 5 ontario january 24th 1969 dear captain cole thank 
 you very much for your very kind letter about my father his death certainly came as a complete surprise to 
 all of us he hadn t been feeling too well before christmas but he didn t let on that it 
 was as serious as it eventually proved to be apparently he died peacefully 0:peace 0:fully while he was sleeping in 
 his armchair 0:arm 0:chair none of us have really recovered from the shock i am very grateful to you for 
 the things you said about him in your letter in the past two weeks i have been very moved by 
 a number of members of your princess patricia organization particularly the ones i met for the first time at the 
 funeral i knew that his association with the patricias was always a source of great pride to him after meeting 
 some of his comrades i understand better why the work that you mention which he did for the organization always 
 gave him such pleasure and satisfaction you may have already heard from my brother captain john barclay dad wanted him 
 to continue with his manuscripts 0:manu 0:scripts and stories so john has taken them all back with him to ottawa 
 where he is stationed when he has these papers sorted out he will be sending you the few remaining mementoes 
 for your museum i would be very grateful if you would express my sincere thanks and that of the whole 
 family to the commanding officer and all ranks of the home station and to the members of the ppcli association 
 who have been so thoughtful and generous 0:gen 0:erous to all of us the flowers which you sent were a 
 great comfort especially to my mother again thank you for your kind letter and please let me know if there 
 is ever anything i can do sincerely robert barclay 3rd bn the royal green jackets bfpo 23 7th february 1969 
 the editor the patrician ppcli currie barracks calgary alberta dear sir i find it hard to believe that sixteen months 
 ago jenny and i left ist battalion in edmonton the months have simply flashed by and i am rather ashamed 
 i have not put pen to paper to you before now one way and another i seem to 
 16 have got quite a lot of news and i am not altogether sure where i should start i am 
 delighted to say we have retained contact with many of our friends in both battalions our various correspondents keep us 
 well in touch and we eventually hear about most of the significant postings 0:post 0:ings and events 2nd battalion kindly 
 asked me to their kapyong dinner in april 1968 and i need hardly say i thoroughly enjoyed myself it was 
 fun meeting so many old friends after what was then an eighteen month gap and i enjoyed their undivided attention 
 whilst i recounted mv visit to expo it seemed odd that a foreigner should be telling them about this magnificent 
 0:mag 0:nificent achievement in their own country but 0:coun 0:try 0:but such are one s circumstances in the army during 
 the evening i also stole a short interlude in the sergeants mess things hadn t changed a bit the hospitality 
 0:hospi 0:tality and friendship was tremendous and i thoroughly enjoyed seeing many old friends again during the summer i had 
 to go back to england to attend the support company 0:com 0:pany commanders course this was a very leisurely course 
 and designed to prepare me for my present job it was interesting and fun and all the more so when 
 i discovered i was about to be lectured by rod middleton on one occasion 0:occa 0:sion when the course visited 
 old sarum my next surprise was a little late in the summer this came one day when i was sitting 
 in my office minding mv own business the telephone rang and to my astonishment my caller announced himself 0:him 0:self 
 as harry bloom he was supposed to be in cyprus or so i thought and i couldn t understand why 
 he should be ringing me from there however i soon discovered that he had escaped the clutches 0:clut 0:ches of 
 colonel arthur potts and was enjoying a very short leave in germany he gave me a quick rundown of life 
 with ist battalion in cyprus and then said he couldn t get up to see us as he had no 
 time to spare a pity because i had lots to ask him life then seemed to rush madly by with 
 exercises and so on and before we knew it christmas was upon us the keep in touch time of year 
 had arrived with a vengeance and we seemed to send almost as many across the atlantic as we did across 
 the channel i was particularly delighted to get my annual card from the terrible tri of richardson shawcross and wilson 
 a torid reminder of my happy days in a company and a gesture i appreciate enormously immediately after christmas we 
 had a small invasion peter nan and anna maione came to stay for a couple of nights and we couldn 
 t have enjoyed their visit more it was all too short but great fun and a wonderful opportunity to catch 
 up with the 2nd battalion gossip lou grimshaw has suddenly started to strut around like a peacock six feet tall 
 it must be something to do with becoming a father heather produced louis christopher edward grimshaw two days ago and 
 all three are doing well i have heard from my successor david williams quite frequently he writes glowing reports of 
 his exchange tour and is clearly enjoying life every bit as much as i did i enjoyed edmonton but i 
 must admit that i do slightly regret not having been in calgary some of you may have heard i have 
 decided to leave the army it is a big decision to make and in many respects a sad one but 
 for a multitude of reasons i feel compelled to go however i am negotiating for one of two jobs and 
 i hope i shall find my new life both rewarding 0:re 0:warding and satisfying in order to meet your deadline 
 sir i fear this is a very hurried and rather disjointed letter however if it does nothing else it gives 
 jenny and i and our two canadian acquisitions the opportunity of sending our very best wishes to our many friends 
 in both battalions yours sincerely peter littlehale editor s note major pg littlehale served with first and second battalion as 
 a british exchange officer for two years prior to his return to england and his regiment in october 1967

 19 the p p c l i comedy company introduction it was a month or so after passchendaele that most 
 useless and sanguinary battle in which the regiment suffered 363 casualties out of a fighting strength of 600 it had 
 been a battle not only against the pick of the german army but against nature itself the leaden skies the 
 water logged terrain and everywhere the mud mud mud the cost of those few thousand yards of useless ground had 
 indeed been heavy and the toll which had been exacted from those who were left was still being paid the 
 horror of passchendaele was still with the men who shuffled into the improvised theatre on that december night it was 
 in their dragging feet their slumped shoulders their blank and wooden faces and their glazed eyes never had jack mclaren 
 tom lilly freddie fenwick and the others faced such a dead audience not even at steenvoorde when eighteen months before 
 they played their first show then it had been a hostile audience now it was one without any feeling for 
 the first ten or fifteen minutes there was no reaction then something more outrageous than usual from the stage lighted 
 a small spark and by intermission time there were some signs of life the players worked their hardest never had 
 they put more into their efforts but it was like punching a feather bed suddenly the spark ignited the audience 
 came alive and when the curtain came down for the last time it was to the usual roars of applause 
 a dead regiment had come alive and in two hours the comedy company had done more to restore the morale 
 of a fighting unit than all the month long efforts of officers nco s doctors padres and the rest the 
 names of those who so truly laid the foundations of a great regiment are well known farquhar gault buller hughie 
 niven charlie stewart talbot papineau and harry mullin hugh mackenzie bob spall and all the rest to those names should 
 be added the members of the comedy company these are the men who spread green rushes under our feet and 
 lifted up our hearts when we needed it most jack mclaren was one of the original seven members and was 
 with the show until it merged with the dumbells at armistice time fifty years ago we will let jack tell 
 the story unfortunately space in the patrician is limited and if you want more consult mac lean s magazine jan 
 1 and may 15 1929 most libraries have it here is jack s story r g b mirth and mud 
 j w mclaren toward the end of may 1916 the battalion was lying in a rest camp near ypres the 
 evening came that we were to go up and relieve the r c r in the front line the sector 
 to be taken over was right up at the nose of the salient a pleasant little job just before we 
 moved off there were six surprised men who were told to report to the paymaster captain pembroke at the transport 
 lines about two kilometers 0:kilo 0:meters back they were privates t j lilly w i cunningham p d ham s 
 morrison f fenwick and the present writer i do not know what the thoughts were that passed through the minds 
 of the others but on my way over the fields to 
 20 the ppcli comedy compony some of the members are shown here in a studio photograph standing l to r 
 langley hamilton mert plunkett allen tennant mclean jack mclaren sitting l to r wells murray newman fred fenwick ayre the 
 transport lines i asked myself have i been overpaid am i going to be shot at dawn am i going 
 to be discharged or am i to be specially equipped for a raid into fritz s trenches when we arrived 
 we were lined up and told that we were to miss a trip in the line and rehearse a little 
 show instead the paymaster who was quite a comedian would be one of the party oh lucky seven what a 
 wonderful night what a glorious sunset the party was to be known as the princess pats comedy company the morning 
 after the great liberation was a different story the lucky seven were to rehearse a show but they had to 
 write it first and they only had seven days to do it in well after all we figured that the 
 things the boys would like best would be local topics so the dugout the orderly room the sick parade and 
 the c o s headquarters were selected the show was written by the seven sitting around a shell hole the 
 rehearsal for a show in those days was funnier than the actual show rehearsals always are but here in the 
 quietest corner of the transport lines behind a hedge a space was marked out with stones to represent a stage 
 with entrances and exists on either side ham was chosen as stage manager and the fight was on high in 
 the blue heavens above the allemand would be over in his plane watching everything and our anti aircraft guns would 
 open up on him the falling shrapnel was often provoking and a very disturbing feature when rehearsal was in full 
 swing it had to stop until a better ole was found the battalion grooms too while out exercising their horses 
 would suddenly come across us in our secluded corner and stop dead they would loop the loop backwards three times 
 pull their horses to safety then beat it 
 21 it was just in this very corner that the first girl beauty chorus sprouted of course we had to 
 have ladies in the party which meant wigs major adamson was supposed to be returning from england with costumes but 
 we hadn t the foggiest idea of what he would bring and we doubted if he would run to wigs 
 in the back garden of what had once been a beautiful cottage there were two chairs one stood upright and 
 the other evidently had fainted imagine the hearty cheers and a tiger when we discovered that the stuffing of these 
 chairs was horsehair and what beautiful wigs it made that same night we discovered the hide of a calf on 
 the walls of a nearby barn a calf yes and more here was our second big strike with the aid 
 of a jack knife and darkness enough of the bovine youngster s hide was secured to make excellent beards and 
 moustaches about the fifth day of our rehearsals word came that the germans had broken through the salient and the 
 battalion had been badly cut up of course shows were forgotten we donned our equipment and went up the line 
 that was the night of june 2nd after we were relieved a very small scattering of the ppcli went back 
 to steenvoorde to wait for reinforcements never was entertainment 0:enter 0:tainment needed more as the morale of the men was 
 low it was decided to put on a show in steenvoorde there is a little upstairs hall with no ventilation 
 and a fair stage we used bunting as scenery and illuminated it with acetylene lights all was set for our 
 first show when we were confronted with a terrible dilemma we had no pianist someone mentioned a norman clarke who 
 had come up with the last draft so he was immediately lassoed and brought into the corral as norman himself 
 confessed he lacked the theatrical experience necessary to accompany a revue type show however he proved to be very handy 
 with a hammer and so was elected property man without a dissenting vote he had one good idea that night 
 he opened the windows and thumped away at the piano hoping to lure some rachmaninoff to the keyboard but after 
 an hour and a half no one suitable had appeared defeated we went off to our bully beef supper imagine 
 our joy when on our return to the theatre from the open window came the strains of the most wonderful 
 music when we had fought our way through the horde of listeners on the stairs there he was with a 
 mess tin on his belt hook no puttees a balaclava on his head our great white hope literally making that 
 piano eat out of his two hands the player was leonard young of the 9th field ambulance and our immediate 
 worries were over but were they we had a curtain drawn over the stage so that the audience couldn t 
 see us but we could peer through the burlap and see and hear them and they weren t exactly shouting 
 compliments at us this is the picture the month is june the summer weather is beautiful the troops had been 
 paid twenty crisp new francs the lure of the estaminet was on them and then half of the battalion had 
 been made to forego such pleasant surroundings and fall in and parade to an entertainment some six kilometers from their 
 billets we were the christians awaiting in our cells to be thrown to the lions and they hungered for blood 
 the first number was a burlesque on uncle tom s cabin through a torrent of boos hisses and vulgar references 
 to parentage the lucky seven fought their lines across to the enemy the thespians rolled up their sleeves put their 
 ears well back and gritted their teeth we silenced about 25 of the audience round two was a single a 
 funny song sung by captain pembroke the round went in favour of the audience but they were beginning to weaken 
 round three was a duet with chorus the audience was groggy now and on the entrance of the chorus at 
 the end of verse one we had them taking the count the next act was a sketch in which a 
 comic staff officer and a private appeared played by t j lilly and me 
 22 the lads out in front fairly gobbled up this part of the menu and cried for more the trick 
 had been turned and the world was safe for democracy and concert parties compulsory parades from now on were taboo 
 we never looked back and continued to play to packed houses throughout 0:through 0:out the summer in september the canadian 
 corps went down to the somme and we were told to follow as best we could thanks to the taking 
 ways of norm clarke our meagre properties which in the beginning filled only a few ration bags had swelled to 
 two lorry loads we found an artillery battery which was going down by rail and bagged a flat car from 
 an obliging rto on arriving at warloy we threw a marque against the end of an old house and the 
 pioneer battalion built a stage and put in bench seats it was here that the comedy company did some of 
 its best work men who had been in the thick of the somme battles just a few hours before made 
 up our audiences some with bandaged 0:band 0:aged heads or arms in a sling or perhaps with a touch of 
 shell shock how those lads enjoyed the shows possibly the finest compliment we ever had came from the co of 
 a dressing station across the road who came over one day and said you fellows are doing far more for 
 the troops than i can with all the pills medicines and medical supplies i have you re a godsend the 
 corps left the somme on october 10th but in the mad scramble we were forgotten and left behind no rations 
 no billets we were forlorn eventually 0:even 0:tually we arrived at railhead and after some palaver with the rto were 
 told to pile on to a train which would leave in 15 minutes that was at 5 30 a m 
 nothing happened at noon the engine took off for god knows where we settled down for the night cold and 
 hungry in the still of the night there was a mighty bang followed by much shouting in french and english 
 and toots on a falsetto horn we travelled all that night all the next day and another night and finally 
 arrived back where we had started from the second try was more successful and that evening we arrived at barlin 
 the vimy railhead we were home again and in short order were back in business a happy reference to the 
 quartermaster in one of our shows brought us new uniforms from theskin out a permanent hut with glory be a 
 stove a raid on a deserted convent in hersin gave us new scenery and the royal closets in england disgorged 
 costumes both male and female col claude hill of the r c r loaned his band one of the finest 
 in france and from then on they orchestrated all our music and the wonderful 0:wonder 0:ful tone of their reed 
 section provided a wonderful accompaniment for our christmas show at mont st eloi in 1916 we put on a pantomime 
 called alladin localized of course to the army vernacular for this show we decided to re paint our scenery and 
 an engineer s dump yielded by moonlight brushes colors and size unfortunately there was no white so we filled a 
 sandbag with chunks of chalk which fritzie s guns had knocked from some of the neighboring 0:neigh 0:boring villas when 
 this was properly pounded to powder and mixed with size we had a fair imitation of the real thing the 
 magic cave of treasure became a canteen showing divers beer barrels rum jars and other well recognized receptacles a painted 
 backdrop of the mont st eloi tower for our first act brought down the house the last scene was in 
 a palace and nobby clarke with only a jack knife and can opener cut up dozens of biscuit tins which 
 were nailed to the flats and reflected the lights from the foots eight acetylene lamps at the top of the 
 staircase stood a large tin of macconachie one performance which stands out clearly in my memory was the one on 
 new year s eve it was to start at 10 p m and finish at the entrance of the new 
 year our prognostications of it being a well received show proved only too true for suddenly in the middle of 
 a song or sketch some feeble minded offspring of a wealthy canadian parent would suddenly come to and applaud most 
 vocifer 
 23 ously toward the end of the show a whole bench suddenly collapsed throwing the occupants to the floor where 
 they decided to finish their slumbers at five minutes to twelve the colonel and his staff were played in by 
 the pipe band the signal for another great ovation we thought the show was finished but the audience would have 
 none of it and did not call quits until each of us had done several impromptu turns it was then 
 about 3 a m during this period we put on a new show every month playing at barlin bruay ecoives 
 and mont st eloi in one of these shows we had a quartette in a dug out the set was 
 composed of sand bags filled with straw and hung on a light square frame so that the whole set could 
 be easily moved by one man on occasion quartette harmony trouble occurs and a rancid note will float out one 
 night the quartette was gathered around the brazier dispensing close harmony with much gusto when suddenly it happened out came 
 the sour note fortissimo three of the four carried on but the fourth his feelings badly offended quit and arose 
 bearing the whole dug out on his shoulders shouting you can finish the goddamn number yourselves and with a torrent 
 of army language that would make a sergeant wince made his exit leaving the others to get off the stage 
 as best they could another number which drew great applause was the high diving act on one side of the 
 stage stood a large prop water tank while on the other side a ladder went up into the flys the 
 speeler had a long fast line about the tank and the diver vera skinnay who would dive from the roof 
 200 feet above executing a jack knife triple flop reverse horizontal perpendicular swansong dive passing through the barrel of a 
 lee enfield rifle into the tank without spilling a drop of water etc after much stage business accompanied by circus 
 music vera went up the ladder and disappeared in the flys allowing enough time for vera to come down back 
 stage and get round into the tank a dummy diver dressed like vera plunged down from above and splashed into 
 the tank accompanied 0:accom 0:panied by a roll on the drum and the crash of cymbals a can full of 
 rice was thrown from the tank to simulate the splash and vera her mouth full of water which she splashed 
 on the stage stepped out of the tank and onto the stage bowing profusely to the strains of suitable music 
 one night vera over stimulated himself with army issue rum he was a little exuberant on his entrance but managed 
 to mount the ladder safely once there he refused to come down despite anguished pleas to get the hell down 
 and into the tank finally a task force of two went aloft and managed to get the inebriate into the 
 tank where he proceeded to throw out everything available the dummy the rice the glass of water the chair and 
 last of all veras wig came sailing through the air followed by vera herself who pointed out that the whole 
 thing had been a fake our fame spread and what started out as a battalion show spread to brigade and 
 division perhaps due to our success the top brass became interested and soon other companies were operating most of them 
 under the ymca in june our company was temporarily disbanded and the players returned to their companies there was fairly 
 heavy fighting during the summer culminating in the passchendaele show and when we got out of that and it was 
 decided to re activate the comedy company four of our number had gone down the line three wounded and another 
 on a course to take their places we found s g nicholls a splendid tenor w filson a strong baritone 
 c hillman an experienced actor c stephens a female impersonator w kilpatrick who took over nobby clarke s job as 
 property man n d nicholson a more than competent pianist these added to the old originals t j lilly fred 
 fenwick and myself made up the second party just before christmas 1917 the battalion moved back to the vimy front 
 
 24 march 21st and the great german drive which almost wiped out the british sth and for the next couple 
 of months we played in the old familiar places then came army all the available troops were called back to 
 front line duty and we cleaned our rifles and polished our brass ready to go back to our companies after 
 some days a messenger finally came and i was ordered to report to the colonel imagine my surprise when i 
 was handed an order not for the trenches but to take the concert party to london for a command performance 
 i ll never understand the army here we were in the middle of a decisive battle when every man was 
 needed and we were ordered to london back with the company the boys wouldn t believe it until the trucks 
 arrived to take our props to storage the tailor came to fit our new outfits and sundry brass hats drilled 
 us on the correct behaviour when confronted with royalty on arrival in london we were put up at the regent 
 palace hotel where everything was on the house except reanimating beverages a far cry from the somme and no rations 
 ah c est la guerre the great day finally arrived when we appeared at the apollo theatre before royalty we 
 were enthusiastically received the last of our five acts was a scene in hell old nick was seated on his 
 throne surrounded by his imps and there came hurtling down a chute in turn such repulsive army characters as the 
 sergeant major the paymaster the sanitary man and the conscientious objector each one of whom on arrival being sentenced to 
 various fiery punishments the last to arrive was kaiser bill himself and when his satanic majesty was confronted by the 
 war lord he immediately cringed and warped into snivelling submission and abdicated his throne in favour of the kaiser declaring 
 he was an amateur compared to him that was the end of the show but when the cue line was 
 given the curtain stayed up kaiser bill on the throne ventriloquised the message to the wings to drop the curtain 
 nothing happened again the kaiser through clenched teeth entreated please give us the curtain again nothing so stepping off the 
 throne he goose stepped to the wings and in a clarion voice that echoed through the theatre shouted come on 
 doc drop the bloody curtain the whole audience including the royal party roared their approval no finer denouement of a 
 play could possibly be written we had been told to get into our uniforms as quickly as possible after the 
 show to receive royalty but either the curtain calls took too long or the royal party was too impatient for 
 the royal party arrived in our dressing room while we were still in our bulbous army issue underwear but the 
 royal party took the situation in its stride and carried on the usual chit chat with nonchalance what might easily 
 have become embarrassing confusion turned into a loud buffo when king george v in parting said to his mary come 
 on doc let s drop the bloody curtain and go these stories could go on forever but space will not 
 permit but before i write the last chapter there is one more that must be included just outside st hilaire 
 where we stayed for some time was a chinese labour battalion these orientals had been brought to france to work 
 behind the lines building reserve trench lines light railways handle engineer supplies and ammunition and for any other heavy labour 
 they were a strange lot and while their official uniform was a blue blouse with brass buttons they loved to 
 discard it in favour of more bizarre items of dress and adornment celluloid wing collars brown bowler hats umbrellas 0:um 
 0:brellas everything and anything took their fancy and their meagre pay they held a strange fascination for t j lilly 
 and he spent a lot of time studying the heathen chinee at close quarters the result was one of his 
 finest efforts two pieces of tape pulled back his eyelids to the almond shape he desired a pigtail and a 
 blue issue blouse completed the transformation his only props were two upright posts holding a union jack which with a 
 quick flip of the 
 25 wrist was removed disclosing a row of socks little ones on the left growing in size to large ones 
 on the right after a great harangue in montreal chinese with a few scottish words thrown in he commenced to 
 play the blue bells of scotland ably assisted of course by someone off stage news of this strange chinaman reached 
 the chinese battalion and one night many of them came to investigate while the act was on they crowded around 
 the stage door and on to the stage in a great state of perplexity and confusion trying to discover more 
 of this stange countryman of theirs to the great joy of lilly the cast and the audience when we got 
 back to france after playing the st james theatre and at bexhill the canadians were on the move amiens monchy 
 canal dv nord valenciennes followed each other in quick succession and there was no time for concert parties the concert 
 party took root at frevent and shortly after were joined by capt mert plunkett and the dumbells we decided to 
 join forces and put on gilbert sullivan s h m s pinafore on november 10th we moved to valenciennes and 
 the following day armistice day to mons we were ready to open that night but the germans had cut all 
 the wiring in the theatre and we opened the following evening to a roaring capacity audience of 2000 soldiers and 
 civilians who wouldn t let us go until they and we were exhausted after three weeks of that we went 
 to brussels for a three day rest the most strenuous rest i have ever experienced we had to give a 
 concert before we even got out of our truck we roller skated down the main streets giving impromptu concerts and 
 speeches whenever we saw a balcony we stopped shows in the theatres snarled the traffic in the streets and gave 
 a swimming and diving exhibition 0:exhibi 0:tion in the fountains in front of the bourse eventually we returned to mons 
 as the psalmist has said weary sore distressed and languid and with a bad case of laryngitis a few weeks 
 later we returned to brussels to give a special performance for king albert and his queen the first performance staged 
 there by british troops since the night before the battle of waterloo slowly we made our way through the towns 
 of flanders and france until we reached the base at lehavre here we packed up our gear to go to 
 england and then on to canada and demobilization but that was not the end in the summer of 1919 the 
 dumbells were re born under mert plunkett and for nearly three years we played every city town and hamlet in 
 canada and many places in the usa winding up on broadway but that is another story and it s high

 this change in structure went practically unnoticed in the light of a much greater impending personal change the disbandment 0:disband 
 0:ment of the depot this omen of doom was received early in the year and was met with mixed emotions 
 it was not a bolt from the blue as we had known for some time that is was to take 
 place the implications of such a disbandment at first staggered the imagination postings destruction of files future of the home 
 station control of the ppcli association the museum the archives the list can go on ad infinitum with this disbandment 
 the move of first battalion to calgary and the battalion physically in cyprus crystal balls and ouiji boards were much 
 in evidence the first ray of light was the news that an element of the depot would remain on the 
 ground until the 31st of october with the last recruit platoon graduating on the sth of june this gave us 
 a much needed breathing space it afforded sufficient time to disband without haste and assist in the move of the 
 first battalion to calgary the sequence of possibilities is now lost to antiquity but will never be forgotten the possibility 
 of an amalgamation of infantry units was explored the delegation of authority for regimental affairs was bantered about the canadian 
 airborne regiment was coming to edmonton and it wasn t the ppcli home station was going to calgary and it 
 wasn t finally the fog lifted and the pieces of the puzzle fell into place an attempt will be made

 fondly referred to as mr patricia on the 22nd of november the final page on an illustrious career was written 
 after 32 and one half years service as a patricia major whj stutt was retired it is but a cliche

 proceeded to calgary with all the previous regimental affairs that were handled by the regimental depot and took up the

 35 first battalion 1968 in summary the beginning of the year 1968 found the battalion preparing for un peacekeeping duties 
 in cyprus from january until april sub units were trained in internal security operations outpost living and routine and all 
 personnel were given historical and background information about cyprus including the current situation on the island operation co operation was 
 held during january in which a group of officers and men from 2 qor of c briefed battalion members on 
 their experiences while serving in cyprus information was also passed on to the wives in order to provide them with 
 general background information and an understanding of the role of the unit as part of unficyp united nations force in 
 cyprus during january and february hq 1 cibg ran a series of competitions to test the skills of selected sub 
 units from within the brigade 1 ppcli teams placed first in the pioneer and 84 mm anti tank competitions second 
 in the signals patrolling and 106 mm anti tank competitions and third in the winter tent group competition participants in 
 the patrol competition were more than slightly chagrined when after having trained in the snow for two months at temperatures 
 as low as 30 f they were subjected during the competition to a chinook wind that caused the temperature to 
 soar to 70 f in the exercise area the advance party departed for cyprus on march 30th with the main 
 body following during the period 9th to 15th april included in the battalion organization was x bty 3 rcha and 
 eight personnel from 3 fd sqn sent to kyrenia harbour 
 36 cpl cs taje on observation post duty 
 37 reinforce the pioneer platoon with skilled carpenters electricians and plumbers the inclusion of x bty as part of the 
 unit resulted in a happy affiliation that worked to the great satisfaction of all but it necessitated the battalion having 
 to leave a rather large rear party in edmonton three officers and 157 men remained behind including c coy complete 
 the contrast between edmonton and cyprus in the month of april was rather marked to say the least as personnel 
 disembarked at nicosia airport in temperatures ranging from 70 to 80 f as each sub unit arrived it was transported 
 0:trans 0:ported to its area of responsibility where it then relieved its opposite numbers in the outgoing battalion 1 rhc 
 after an initial settling in period an excellent leave programme was organized and various tours and sightseeing trips were arranged 
 through the welfare officer the unit area of responsibility kyrenia district was from a military point of view one of 
 the more interesting of the un districts in cyprus due to the presence within it of the largest turkish enclave 
 on the island and the rather close proximity of greek cypriot national guard and turkish cypriot fighter fdls in the 
 areas of close confrontation the rifle companies including the rifle battery were assigned specific areas of responsibility and within these 
 the companies were responsible for the operation of a number of ops the recce platoon along with b sqn fgh 
 covered the remainder of the district with vehicle mounted patrols the recce platoon alone averaging some 630 miles of patrolling 
 weekly bn hq was located with one of the companies a short distance from the town of kyrenia overlooking the 
 mediterranean in the north western portion of the island support company was located approximately 20 kilometers away from bn hq 
 at camp maple leaf just outside nicosia support company found itself integrated into ccasg canadian contingent administrative support group and 
 carried out its normal functions of provision of transport maintenance repairs etc within that organization the stay in cyprus was 
 a pleasant and rewarding experience during the battalion s tour there were no major disturbances and though kyrenia district was 
 potentially one of the more explosive areas on the island it remained relatively calm and peaceful during the unit s 
 tenure this was due in no small part to the alertness steadiness and plain common sense shown by all ranks 
 in dealing with situations which could have become unpleasant if allowed to develop in the rather tense atmosphere that still 
 existed between the greek and turkish cypriots during the final months in cyprus a decision was made to reduce the 
 canadian contingent by approximately one third and this resulted in considerable reorganization regrouping and general hard work in order to 
 adopt a new operational posture by the time the relieving battalion 3r22er arrived to the great credit of all ranks 
 this was done quickly and efficiently so that the van doos were able to take over in a new situation 
 for which administrative procedures 0:pro 0:cedures drills and routines had largely been developed the return to canada also proceeded with 
 a minimum of problems with personnel taking leave at various points en route to calgary and edmonton the last aircraft 
 arrived on october 15 th after a 24 hour delay in departure from nicosia and a 32 hour flight home 
 while in cyprus word had been received that the unit was to be relocated at currie barracks in calgary and 
 the move from the hamilton gault barracks had in fact been carried out by the rear party during the month 
 of august thus on returning from leave many of the younger soldiers entered the gates of currie barracks for the 
 first time for many of the older soldiers however it was a return to an old and fondly remembered stamping 
 ground 
 38 on arrival in canada a large number of personnel were immediately posted to the then forming canadian airborne regiment 
 and others vanished as reinforcements to the second battalion in germany these losses in personnel were largely offset however by 
 the acquisition of a number of officers and men from 2 qor of c who had remained in calgary after 
 disbandment of their battalion the large changeover in personnel combined with the adjustments required in occupying new barracks caused a 
 number of administrative problems which were compounded by having to convert to the new infantry battalion establishment 5 5 and 
 at the same time be ready to commence winter training in january planning to meet these requirements went on while 
 the battalion was on leave and as personnel returned to duty they were assigned an establishment position 0:posi 0:tion within 
 the new organization along with new living stores and training accommodation in december a winter training cadre was formed and 
 tasked with training all personnel of the battalion in the basics of winter warfare a number of years had passed 
 since the unit had done winter training and at first it seemed that it might be difficult to find the 
 number of old arctic hands required for the cadre eventually however a nucleus of these stalwarts were located and organization 
 commenced all ranks drew their winter kit during december and departed for xmas and new years leave firm in the 
 knowledge that on their return an extended period of frolicking in the snow awaited them hq 1 combat group had 
 announced that they intended to forego the usual summer concentration and sub first battalion reconnaissance platoon and friend at recce

 40 stitute in its stead a four to five week winter concentration under canvas at camp wainwright commencing in the 
 latter part of january in summation 1968 could be described as a full and rewarding year which once again demonstrated 
 the old adage concerning the versatility and adaptability of the average infantryman and one in which the key word just 
 had to be flexibility cpl gr coldwell discussing the carob harvest with two of the locals life in the outposts 
 each rifle company in cyprus was responsible for manning a number of ops whose principle tasks were to maintain surveillance 
 report on any unusual occurrences and ensure that the terms of the truce were not being violated each op was 
 manned by a corporal and five men and a normal tour was thirty days although section commanders remained affiliated with 
 a specific op until company areas of responsibility changed to a large extent the remainder of the battalion was organized 
 to support the operation of the ops and it was these locations that will remain fixed in the minds of 
 many as being cyprus the following two reports were written by op commanders and give something of the flavour of 
 what un peacekeeping duties were like for the average soldier if a note of monotony boredom and routine runs throughout 
 the reports it is because that is the waythings 0:way 0:things generally were naturally there were also some tense moments 
 as the author of one of the reports cpl komadina could have mentioned when for example on one occasion he 
 was called upon to face down members of the greek national guard who were intent on ventilating the person of 
 a turkish cypriot fighter who had strayed forward of his own position

 man would go out on a one hour patrol to check for any possible build up by either side along 
 the fdls after a much needed shower we would then await the supply sergeant bringing in our daily supplies of 
 food fresh water and case upon case of soft drinks the remainder of the morning was spent doing odd jobs 
 and clean ups that had to be done before the afternoon when it was too hot to work the temperature 
 usually reached 110 f in the shade by early afternoon and cooled little until evening even during the night the 
 air remained warm and stifling the only relief afforded was by very infrequent and short flash storms after lunch the 
 afternoon was spent resting or occasionally going on swim parades to kyrenia unless we were called upon to escort island 
 shepherds or farmers from one point to another to guard against possible real or imaginary attacks by one faction or 
 the other the balance of our time was spent whitewashing rocks to improve the overall appearance of the op or 
 preparing for frequent yip visits from the different contingents on the island finnish swedish british irish danish and a variety 
 of canadian personnel evenings were spent reading playing cards writing letters home or some times going to the company base

 ment the daily routine of garrison life can easily become demoralizing to comba this the first battalion has formed an 
 adventure training club with the purpose o providing stimulating and challenging training for the individual soldier unde the auspices of 
 this club rear party 1 ppcli conducted a series of small scale ex ercises during the summer of 1968 on 
 the athabasca river between hinton am whitecourt these trips proved to he both interesting and beneficial to the soldier who 
 participated in them as well as providing the soldiers with a relaxing chang of pace from garrison duty it enabled 
 them to gain valuable new skills and practi cal experience in the arts of bushcraft and watermanship the enthusiastic receptioi 
 this training has received has given birth to plans for similar adventure trainin exercises on a wider scale but that 
 is in the future reprinted below for you interest and reading enjoyment is a narrative written by lt ps jarvis 
 describin river patrol 3 on tuesday the 2nd of july 1968 the third group of paddlers shoved of from the 
 bank of the athabasca river at hir ton alberta to begin a five day one hundred and forty mile trip 
 down the turbulent river to whitecourt this trip as was the case with the two preceding ones was part of 
 the adventure trainin program of 1 ppcli rear party for the summer of 1968 the benefits of thes trips are 
 innumerable they are valuable from the point of physical fitness anc endurance as exercises in map using and navigation in 
 providing opportunities ii leadership experience for patrol commanders as an opportunity for the junio leader to gain an insight into 
 the character of his men during the relaxed atmos phere which prevails and of course they allow all concerned to 
 leave regular dutie behind and head for an enjoyable outing in the bush 
 53 the administrative arrangements necessary for a trip of this nature are essentially simple one of the basic premises behind 
 adventure training is that it is done with the minimum equipment possible while observing all safety precautions 0:pre 0:cautions since 
 this was the third patrol to do the exercise we had the immense benefit of being able to profit by 
 the advice and experience of those who had preceded us this foreknowledge proved very helpful indeed especially in our selection 
 of stores even so we were to discover later that we to had made the common mistake of carrying more 
 equipment than necessary all administrative preparations having been completed the eight members of our party met in the men s 
 kitchen hamilton gault barracks at 0530 hrs the 2nd of july for breakfast we ate a hearty meal stacks of 
 hotcakes and rashers of bacon disappeared like magic everyone was no doubt thinking that this might well be the last 
 good meal for several days to come at 0550 hrs transport consisting 0:con 0:sisting of one staff car one 3 
 a ton truck and one 2 2 ton truck specially fitted with racks to carry our two 16 and one 
 14 canoes arrived the 3 a ton had been previously ioaded with the majority of our stores with the final 
 loading of fresh jrations and box lunches we were ready to depart at 0600 hrs we were on the road 
 the party reached hinton at 1030 hrs and the canoes were immediately offloaded stores divided into proportionate loads enveloped in 
 waterproof polyethylene bags and secured firmly in the canoes at 1100 hrs having devoured the box lunches provided the party 
 boarded the canoes and pushed off the athabasca is a muddy turbulent river whose swift current averages between 6 8 
 mph and in some stretches reaches speeds of up to 12 mph the river s width varies between 50 200 
 yards there are few truly treacherous stretches in the river but the fast flowing current creates waves and swells of 
 up to three feet and higher depth is rather deceptive because of the colour of the water however 0:how 0:ever 
 with practice one can soon learn to read the current the waves and the river bank and so choose a 
 course with sufficient water for the canoes prior to our departure for hinton the party had conducted a two hour 
 practice run on the north saskatchewan river this run was sufficient to give each man a rudimentary knowledge of canoe 
 handling the river stretch between hinton and oldman creek has few tricky spots and our first day s paddling was 
 rather uneventful on this first day on the river we established a general routine which was followed for the remainder 
 of the trip we would travel approximately two hours locate a fresh stream with water suitable for drinking and pull 
 in for a rest paddling was relatively easy work due to the strong current but nonetheless on this day as 
 on each of the four days to follow the sun shone down relentlessly and with the 80 degrees temperature everyone 
 was certainly ready for a good break after two hours of continous paddling throughout the trip everyone had been advised 
 to watch for any wild game forest fires or even wisps of smoke we were also told to observe any 
 oil or gas slicks on the river which could be the result of breakage in pipelines we were also asked 
 to keep a lookout for any civilians all of these were to be reported to the lands and forests office 
 at whitecourt although we saw a great many moose deer and bear tracks only four deer were actually sighted on 
 the river no oil slicks or civilians were seen we arrived at oldman creek at roughly 1700 hrs unloaded the 
 canoes pulled them well up on the shore overturned them and began setting up the campsite we were to use 
 for the next two nights since we were using polyethylene shelter halves it took very little time to set up 
 our hoochies soon we were relaxing over pork chops and mashed potatoes together with the first cups of the many 
 
 54 gallons of coffee and tea we would consume before the trip was over once supper was done and the 
 clean up completed final preparations for sleeping were made in the shelters everyone then went their own separate ways either 
 to fish read their pocket books or simply sprawl out on a sleeping bag and relax our fishermen 0:fisher 0:men 
 brought in eight good pan sized rainbow trout and one large grayling all of which were greatly appreciated as a 
 supplement to our bacon and eggs the next morning by 2300 hrs we were all asleep expecting a long hard 
 day to follow after breakfast on wednesday six of us began an overland hike into sundance lake cpl s kreuger 
 and winchester were left behind to clean up the camp fish and to have coffee and supper ready for our 
 return perhaps the most difficult section of the hike was crossing the athabasca river and climbing the near vertical slope 
 directly across the river from ovr campsite in order to cross the river we took the two 16 canoes roughly 
 tw3 hundred yards upstream and then one at a time tacked them across to the k r side to a 
 point still about 100 yards upstream from were we started the canoes were pulled ashore well clear of the water 
 everyone changed into combat boot since we had been wearing running shoes to cross the river not wanting to get 
 oi r main footwear wet at this point we all turned to face the 400 vertical clim 3 which loomed 
 above us shuddered and set out for the top we rested on a small grassy plateau approximately 100 feet short 
 of the top from here the view was incredibly beautiful once we had gained the cre t of the hill 
 the going was relatively easy the party was able to follow clear i defined cut lines for the remainder of 
 the march until we reached a similar vertic 1 descent to sundance lake at the lake six hot sweaty dusty 
 soldiers with burnin i feet immediately stripped and waded out through the weeds into the lake all ha 1 been 
 dreaming about for the last three hours the water was cold but no one seemed concerned it was beautiful sundance 
 lake alberta which was reached after a three hour cross country hike from oldman creek 
 55 this was the first two nights campsite of river patrol no 3 at oldman creek alberta sundance lake is 
 shallow weedy and stagnant and appears to contain no fish even our most devoted fisherman pte schmidt finally gave up 
 after about a half hour and went swimming again after eating the sandwiches and tinned fruit we had brought with 
 us we had our last swim dressed and began the long march back by 1730 hrs we were lance again 
 at the oldman creek camp sitting down to a good steak dinner in our absence cpl krueger had caught four 
 large suckers and a good sized trout in the pool where oldman creek flows into the athabasca the next morning 
 we packed our gear and set off for the burland river some forty miles downstream this river stretch is far 
 more challenging than any other thursday proved to be a very enjoyable and at times exciting day the party stopped 
 for its first break at a small unmarked creek after about two hours of paddling we shoved off again and 
 about an hour later we encountered rough water and a large whirlpool we misjudged the whirlpool badly and consequently shot 
 directly through the middle of it fortunately our timing was good and the centre of the pool was nearly full 
 of water at the time we crossed as our hearts stopped pounding we looked back over our shoulders in relief 
 and commenced to bail out the large quantities of water we d picked up we shipped more water at this 
 point than at any other although we were forced to bail frequently throughout the trip that night we camped at 
 the burland there is no adequate campsite at the mouth of the river so we chose an already established area 
 approximately 100 yards upstream pte schmidt produced a wonderful stew and some lousy coffee and after eating we relaxed for 
 the remainder of the evening we had swum at several stops prior to this but here we had some real 
 fun major wawryjbhuk 0:wawry 0:jbhuk decided to try swimming in the burland and talked me into going with him he 
 went in at our campsite and swam with the current down to the junction of the purland and the athabasca 
 where we had pulled up our canoes this game caught 
 56 looking across the athabasca river from the campsite at oldman creek beyond the cliff is sundance lake 
 57 on and soon the heads of major wawrychuk captain mac lean cpl winchester and myself were bobbing down the 
 burland we hiked upstream well above our campsite to get a longer ride but found the river too shallow and 
 our knees too susceptible to hard knocks from the rocks we therefore made this trip only once the water was 
 surprisingly warm and refreshing while we were cavourting in the water the other four members of our patrol tallied a 
 total of four large pike since the burland is too fast to fish they hiked down the athabasca to a 
 couple of backwaters which were quite clear in contrast to the regular dirty brown of this river these cleaner backwaters 
 were created by the clear green water of the burland which forms a definite stream down the north bank of 
 the athabasca for some distance pte schmidt tried a small creek on the south shore of the athabasca and got 
 a few small trout a score of mosquito bites and as usual soaked our objective for friday was chickadee creek 
 some forty five miles downstream 0:down 0:stream from the burland this therefore was our longest day on the river we 
 left the burland at 1030 hrs and didn t arrive at chickadee creek until 2015 hrs that evening when we 
 arrived we found the creek itself inaccessible as there was not sufficient water in either the creek or the approach 
 channel to float the canoes rather than beach our canoes downstream and carry all our gear back up to the 
 campsite at the mouth of the creek we chose instead a camp on an island about 400 yards away since 
 our day s journey had been a long one we ate quickly and went to bed early that night resting 
 for the final morning pull into whitecourt by 0800 hrs saturday morning we were once again on the river at 
 0900 hrs we rounded the last corner and found the whitecourt bridge staring us in the face it seemed to 
 us at that time a beautiful monument and represented the end of our five days on the river transport picked 
 us up at 1030 hrs and two hours later we were back at griesbach without exception everyone enjoyed the trip 
 at times we worked hard and equally often we relaxed each member of the patrol is now an enthusiastic supporter 
 of the adventure training program although we may all at some time or other take part in more difficult and 
 more arduous exercises i do not think that any of us will ever forget this personally rewarding and stimulating trip 
 or the relationships established during it editor s note cpl barger and pte hansen were the remaining members of the 
 patrol whose names do not appear in the foregoing narrative maj wawrychuk and capt mac lean of the canadian airborne

 composition and equipment but not our usual good humor and professionalism the new year was ushered in with a series

 72 exercise danube waltz it was early evening on the 2nd of july 1704 long straight redcoateci ranks advanced steadily 
 up the hillside under the withering fire of ball and cannister 0:can 0:nister three times the ravaged attackers were forced 
 to withdraw from the parapet finally however the shellenberg fortress was stormed and overrun at least a third of the 
 fifteen thousand french and bavarian defenders were killed wounded or drowned as they tried to flee across the river the 
 english cavalry swept down the hill and raced along the river banks hacking and slashing with their sabres at the 
 hapless retreating mob the duke of marlborough s armies had gained a great victory and now held a bridgehead across 
 the danube hostik bavaria lay open and exposed before them two hundred and sixty four years later on the evening 
 of the 4th o december 1968 the soldiers of a company 2 ppcli advanced up the same hillside 0:hill 0:side 
 above the ancient town of donauworth on the danube the patricias however encountered no opposition save gravity as they moved 
 up the hill they were ir fact warmly greeted by the inhabitants of the shellenberg the accommodation anc comfort of 
 the bundeswehr barracks that now occupies the site of the anciem fortress looked welcome indeed a company had come nearly 
 as far as had marlborough s armies when the reached donauworth and the end of their journey they had also 
 travelled much of the way by the same method as the english infantry on foot exercise danube waltz was an 
 adventure training exercise planned b major r i stewart officer commanding a company it was a ten day exercise carried 
 out in november and december 1968 in baden wurtemberg in southern germany the idea of danube waltz was to follow 
 on foot the latter part ol the route taken by the allied armies in 1704 during marlborough s famous march 
 to the danube the duke of marlborough as captain general of the armies of england holland and the holy roman 
 empire had for several years been involved in indecisive campaigning in holland against the armies of louis xiv of france 
 far to the south vienna was threatened by french armies preparing to cross the black forest and link up with 
 their bavarian allies on the danube if louis was successful in capturing vienna the capital of the holy roman empire 
 he coulc bring the emperor to terms and thus dominate all of europe this the allies could not allow to 
 happen despite the fears of the dutch and under the pretext of merely moving to attack france from the south 
 marlborough took his armies out of holland he moved south up the rhine thus beginning one of the brilliant strategic 
 moves in the history of war the whole world watched fascinated waiting for marlborough and his 40 000 infantry cavalry 
 and gunners to turn north west into france the duke confounded friend and foe alike by crossing the rhine at 
 mannheim he then began to march overland in a southeasterly direction toward the danube this completely unexpected change in events 
 caught the french off balance they were being out flanked eventually they were forced to take the field at blenheim 
 on the danube where they were decisively defeated by marlborough his army smashed louis had to fore go forever his 
 ambition to rule all of europe the battle of blenheim thus became one of the decisive battles of european history 
 we in a company planned to follow as closely as possible marlborough s route through the hilly swabian jura our 
 route lay from gross heppach just east of stuttgart to donauworth on the danube a distance of about 130 miles 
 unlike the armies of 1704 we were not encumbered with heavy guns and baggage we marched clean fatigue carrying only 
 mess tins and water bottles like 
 73 marlborough s armies we too had an efficient administrative staff which greeted us with a hot meal and warm 
 accommodation at the end of the marching day american and bundeswehr barracks town halls and school gymnasiums thankfully 0:thank 0:fully 
 made the tentage we carried with us unnecessary marlborough s tired infantry must have thought only of sleep at the 
 end of a long day s march the soldiers of a company were provided with and took advantage of all 
 sorts of recreational facilities in this traditionally friendly part of germany visits to points of local interest such as the 
 magnificent daimler benz car museum in stuttgart were organized coffee and doughnut parties how long do we have to stay 
 sir were laid on by friendly american service clubs recreation runs to various towns or belly dancers in u s 
 ncos clubs kept us on the go long into the evening for those who preferred to remain at home films 
 were shown nightly by the versatile company projectionist cpl toward the historical aspect of the march was not neglected both 
 before and during the exercise we received lectures films and battlefield tours captain richard cohen briefed the marchers each day 
 describing the corresponding progress of marlborough s army our start point was the town of gross heppach it was in 
 this village that ia famous meeting took place between marlborough and his two allies the famous prince eugene of savoy 
 and prince louis of baden the company bivouaced in the meadow where eugene inspected marlborough s cavalry squadrons 264 years 
 before major rl stewart cd and capt rj cohen inspect the marchers on the same ground where prince eugene inspected 
 marlborough s troops two and a half centuries earlier 
 74 the evening before we set off a reception was held for the local dignitarie in the lamm inn it 
 was in this same gasthaus that the three allied commanders held their council of war in 1704 the special a 
 company punch concocted for the occasion by warrant officer preece our cqms very soon created an atmos phere of warmth 
 and fellowship which we continued to encounter throughout the march lieutenant terrence mccarthy performed the first of many spended violin 
 recitals to the great delight of our hosts the senior ncos led by csm bob shim were right in their 
 element sergeants ham liscumb howie smith george sellyeh and our mfc sergeant jerry cruise performed admirably charmini husbands and wives 
 alike this despite their total inability to communicate ir german and eventually in english for that matter on two of 
 the six marching days we marched in platoons as a compan led by major stewart and kept in step by 
 csm shine our minds were taken of our monotony and sore feet by the humourous banter of pte barnes from 
 some where in the ranks of 2 platoon the news that santa claus is dead and the elve have grown 
 up put us all out of step most of the distance was covered in section sized groups led by the 
 junio ncos these sections vied with each other in orienteering schemes along thi route the outstanding section in these competitions 
 was led by cpl ellis cpl hale and bruce also brought in their sections in excellent times and with man 
 points some sections were not as successful as others the cry of has cp haddad arrived yet echoed across the 
 hills more than once during the march sixty marchers from the company including four members of our morta section under 
 sergeant cruise began the march in gross heppach most of thi original group were still marching as we mounted the 
 shellenberg feature six day later despite the limited amount of march training before the exercise only few soldiers were forced 
 to drop out because of bad feet or strained ligaments even then cpl hannush our ma got most of them 
 marching again in short order after several days marching a number of soldiers felt energetic enough to get up basketball 
 game one evening in the town gymnasium in altheim alb craig neilson thornhill leroux landry and others dashed about the 
 floor keepini pace with avery the oc s driver who did his walking to and from the jeep a typical 
 day began with reveille at 0600 hrs we pulled ourselves ou of our sleeping bags and tried to shake off 
 the effects of the night before spen out on the town or at the canteen run by cpl newman jones 
 and pte lockhart breakfast was served between 0630 hrs and 0715 hrs by cpl toone and pt martin our cooks 
 we then packed our kit and stowed it in the trucks a roll cal was held by the sergeant major 
 followed by a briefing by capt cohen on th progress of the march and the program for the day sections 
 were dispatched a five minute intervals long enough for each to disappear into the fog before thi next started the 
 first encounter these sections had with each other was normal during a stop for lunch in some gasthaus in one 
 of the many hamlets along th route to the ry when the marchers had all left sgt liscumb and his 
 administrative crev finished tidying up our accommodation area and packed the stores in the vehicle in preparation for the move 
 to the next bivouac area a hot lunch brought up by the cq awaited us around noon each day generally 
 in a misty field warrant preece and pte gilchrist drove hundreds o miles from our administrative base at the u

 they led us to the town gymnasium over whic i flew the largest canadian flag any of us had ever 
 seen this we later learned ha 1 been hurriedly purchased by the town the day before in anticipation of our 
 arriva tickets were later distributed to the troops by the burgermeister entitling them to free beer in any of the

 th nearby town of hochstadt major stewart aided by ptes neilson and landry lai 1 a wreath at the memorial

 honour of our hosts throughout the march major stewart presented patricia plaques to the burgermeisters and american and german units 
 who had been so kind to us during the exercise the return to fort macleod left us with many fond 
 recollections of the march those that completed it felt that they had accomplished something quite unique and worthwhile they had 
 enjoyed themselves and had demonstrated that the modern infantryman can still travel long distances on foot if need be the 
 countryside was new and the inhabitants quite different from those in the north it was hoped that an interest in 
 military history was aroused in some members of the company certainly no one could help but respect the accomplishment 0:accom

 81 regimental band the year 1968 has produced some far reaching reorganization in the military bands throughout the canadian armed 
 forces of prime importance to the regiment was the amalgamation of the lord strathcona horse royal canadians band with the 
 ppcli band at the end of the year the regimental band numbered 71 all ranks certainly large enough to do 
 credit on any occasion the reorganization of the bands took place with effect the ist of october at that time 
 the confirmation arrived that the band would be lodged in and administered by canadian forces base calgary this posed many 
 problems the main one being the move of families to calgary at the close of december nine iof the original 
 ppcli band members were still commuting to and from edmonton the remainder were firmly ensconced in lodgings in and around 
 cfb calgary the highlight of the year prior to reorganization was a trip by the regimental band to take part 
 in a tattoo during late september at the us marine corps base 29 palms california the hospitality of the marines 
 appeared to have no limits refrigerators in every room cold beer in copious quantities fresh ruit even flowers in the 
 rooms our every wish appeared as a command to the marines cwo p murray supervised a 12 piece swinging set 
 to yellowknife for an annual northwest territories ball 13 january 1969 they returned with presentation cuff links tie clips and 
 miniature muk luks to see these members of the band in parkas was to mistake them for soldiers almost perhaps

 the training year 1967 68 was one of extensive activity the recruiting drive in the spring of 1967 allowed the 
 unit to begin in the fall with a good strength this large complement of men enabled the unit to operate 
 at a high degree of efficiency a programme of week end exercises was carried out leading up to the summer 
 training period in camp wainwright for the first time the battalion was able to supply a small body of men 
 as reinforcements for the second battalion in northwest europe with 4 cmbg within the unit itself no major changes were 
 experienced the rsm cwo williams was asked to stay on another year to allow the proper training of a replacement 
 a general shuffling of the officers allowed all members to experience phases of training and employment other than that which 
 they had previously been involved with the high level of efficiency evident within the training and administration of the battalion 
 illustrated the effectiveness of this shuffling support company was kept busy with an advanced infantry training programme 0:pro 0:gramme designed 
 by the regular force instructors working with us the other two companies b and c rose from the status of 
 partially trained recruits to the level of militia infantrymen group one this enabled us to lay claim to being the 
 most completely trained unit of our kind in western canada after the long months of classroom arid field training experienced 
 during the fall and winter 1967 68 the advent of spring issued in a number of well organized exercises that 
 allowed all this knowledge to be applied to practical use exercise haybay one included a night scheme followed by all 
 companies firing on the mechanical target range defensive action involving a dug in position as well as additional range practices 
 added to these were numerous overnight exercises at local training areas armed forces unification brought a slight change to the 
 battalion role following the formation of ace mobile force one company was allotted to this force the first physical participation 
 occured early in the summer of 1968 the battalion was able to put up a company at near full strength 
 for this concentration 0:concen 0:tration the training of the previous winter stood them in good stead they were able to 
 meld into the exercises with minimal difficulty the remainder of the battalion spent the concentration reviewing the problems of a 
 supporting role following the completion of the concentration the majority of the men remained at camp taking trades and promotional 
 courses some of the more qualified were employed on call out positions to assist in the general administration 0:administra 0:tion 
 at various prairie region camps the majority of the officers on the other hand rather reluctantly returned to the city 
 and their mundane civilian jobs 
 94 eight of our junior nco s were able to travel to germany under the auspices of operation orion this 
 was another first for the battalion never before had overseas training been available to us fortunately all eight were attached 
 to the second battalion after a two week period of integration and familiarization they participated in a schedule of nato 
 exercises this was extremely valuable experience since these exercises involved the large scale deployment 0:deploy 0:ment of troops mechanization nbcw 
 and air mobile aspects of warfare were the main lessons learned the knowledge and experience derived was of tremendous 0:tre 
 0:mendous value to the battalion as well as to the nco s themselves these nco s returned to the unit 
 able to personify the extent and degree of regular force training they had undergone in conclusion the success of the 
 past training cycle is re emphasized in the hope that all the experience gained and the lessons learned will be 
 applied in the cycles to follow with proper application of this experience and knowledge 0:know 0:ledge future years should be 
 even more successful finally a word of thanks and appreciation to regular force personnel attached to the loyal edmonton regiment

 101 quevrain to mons november 1918 or return to mons l hancock a reunion of veterans of the princess patricia 
 s canadian light infantry eld in ottawa in september of this year was for many of us both an historic 
 casion and a satisfying experience the meeting marked the fiftieth anniversary the last hundred days of the first world war 
 old comrades were met old tales ere retold and pledges of brotherhood renewed returning home the reading 1 a newly 
 arrived book by ralph hodder williams princess patricia s anadian light infantry 1914 1919 second edition brought some of those 
 last eat eventful days of the war into vivid focus thus i feel impelled to set in iting my experiences 
 in so far as they related to the movements of number 4 ompany of my regiment princess patricia s canadian 
 light infantry in which i as a platoon commander the enemy was in full retreat by the morning of november 
 7th we had ossed from france into belgium and arrived at quevrain preparatory to taking er the front line of 
 advance by the morning of november 9th our company had en advancing rapidly for two days and two nights meeting 
 only sporadic resistace 0:resist 0:ace from the retreating enemy morale was very high we were conscious of the act that 
 we were now in historic belgium not as conquerors but as liberators ome inner force doubtless due to the years 
 of frustrating trench warfare gave us strength we little knew we possessed our enthusiasm knew no bounds on this morning 
 of november 9th number 4 company under the command 0:com 0:mand of captain a c white was somewhere in the 
 vicinity of the mining town f jemappes with scouts out moving toward the city of mons the significance f the 
 line of advance that had been assigned to us was clear it was at mons n august 1914 that british 
 soldiers made their first stand against the advancing 0:ad 0:vancing german armies here we were in the same area and 
 doubtless treading the same road to be among those returning to the city in victory would be great and symbolic 
 honour 0 „j apparently the german high command had thoughts of another colour we were to discover that we were 
 not to take the city without a fight about ihis time captain white gave me a message to be personally 
 delivered to batsalion 0:bat 0:salion headquarters this 1 accepted with some reluctance not wanting to leave my platoon but having 
 been long enough in the army to know that the first duty of a soldier is to obey even to 
 locate the regimental hq under these open warfare conditions was a job in itself nearing the completion of my mission 
 i was suddenly held up and surrounded by a crowd of civilians they were holding a man they claimed was 
 a german spy they were in an ugly mood and appeared 0:ap 0:peared to want me to assist in lynching 
 him on the spot telling them to stand back and firing a shot into the cobblestone road so that the 
 sparks flew i managed to extricate the man and marched him off to battalion hq here i lost no time 
 in getting rid of him and delivering the message my chief concern now was to get back to my advancing 
 company i had my map of operations and proceeded eastward keeping in sight of the valencienne mons railway which was 
 marked as our left flank i was running ihrough open fields about midway between the railway and the jemappes mons 
 road and could see the city in the distance this area of open fields gradually narrowed down to a point 
 where the road crossed a bridge over the railway and 
 102 into the suburbs of mons not having caught up with the company did not worr me when i considered 
 the speed of their advance i was conscious of occasional rifle shots but passed on and finally arrived at the 
 bridge by running diagonall over the bridge and diving into cover of the embankment on the south side i felt 
 i was safe a cautious civilian at the same spot rapped out something to the effect that i was running 
 into the german line allemand allemand naturally i got back to the west side of the bridge in a hurry 
 and th question was where now in no time at all by retracing my steps i say infantry advancing in 
 single file down the jemappes mons road it was captai cyril white in the lead who exploded as could be 
 expected where the he did you come from so far as i can remember my only reply was don t 
 g over that bridge we flattened out relaxed and discussed the next move it was evident we needed more information 
 fortunately twilight was falling with two or thre scouts i returned over the bridge and into a deep ditch again 
 on the south sid of the road we ran up the ditch to a point where we were stopped by 
 a larg house closely abutting the road all was quiet it appeared safe to proceed t the front of the 
 house where dim light was coming from the basement when knocked on the front door a voice from within called 
 je viens at the sam time a machine gun in another building somewhat further along on the othe side of 
 the road opened up on the house in a split second i was through a hal open driveway gate immediately 
 east of the house frantically vaulting backyan fences back to the other members of my scout party we could clearly 
 see th building from which the firing came but it was too far away for us to reach wit mills 
 hand grenades by the same token it was foolish to think we could do then any damage by firing single 
 rifle shots with the darkness coming on we had t go for further directions captain white advised giving the machine 
 gun nest a dose of rifle grenades these rifle grenades were the same as the hand grenade but adapted to 
 be firet from a rifle duly equipped back we went with the rifle grenadiers and fired o our salvo this 
 time there was no answer now we knew the birds had flowi and we were able to send back the 
 message all clear with the company continuing its advance and feeling myself somewha relieved of duty i could not resist 
 going to the house again this time with mor caution and to the back door i shall never forget the 
 excited cry of the perso who came up from the basement to answer my knock a long ah a a 
 c es un anglais the next few moments were an indescribable mixture of hugs an kisses offerings of bread and 
 cakes lifting up of little children anything to expres their joy it was the home of monsieur defrise and madame 
 defrise who witl their daughters neighbours and children were nineteen in all in that basement being afraid of losing contact 
 with my comrades and assuring them i would return i explained it was necessary to go on for me the 
 days work was over on th floor of a smaller house a few doors down the street which served as 
 compan ho sleep overcame me our senior officers were busy overnight and were ready with a furthe plan of advance 
 with the coming of daylight while it was still dark our advance elements were held up again at another smaller 
 bridge over a watercourse nea a bend in the road leading to avenue jemappes it was november 10th and the 
 attack was to start with the first dim light of dawn lieut w bill popey was to rush the bridge 
 and proceed along the left flank of the main road leading into mons i was to follow with my men 
 to the right side where there was a brewery and again a fairly deep ditch firing commenced with popey s 
 attack and if remember rightly bill and his men were advancing from tree to tree along the 
 103 avenue using whatever cover they could get following with my men and once in the ditch our advance was 
 easier beyond the brewery the ditch ended with a long line of row housing closely fronting on the road as 
 we were not held up we proceeded by hopping the back yard fences and kitchen gardens of these houses it 
 was just too easy and we advanced farther than proved sensible suddenly there was a loud noise of shouting and 
 rushing of feet it was an enemy counter attack in the street out front we had only seconds to get 
 into one of the empty houses by way of a back door up the stairs and into a second storey 
 front room with a window overlooking the street we were six in all it is difficult to describe how men 
 act in such tense and dangerous situations there was deep consternation expressed in various ways we knew we were completely 
 cut off from our company and had no way of knowing how popey and his men had fared calmness quickly 
 returned however and seeing a german soldier in partial view standing immediately below the window the boys wanted me to 
 try and get him with my revolver this i could not do without sticking my head out of the window 
 it was convenient to rationalize afterwards that discretion is the better part of valour big monaghan volunteered to try standing 
 on the inner window ledge with his head near the ceiling and supported by someone else he was able to 
 draw a bead with his rifle on the helmet below there was a sharp report and then the brief i 
 got im there were shouts which indicated the enemy was trying to determine where the shot came from this only 
 increased our sense of extreme danger had anyone tried to come in the back door and up the stairs he 
 would not have lived long this sense of crisis continued until shelling started the buildings we were in being the 
 target at this time we thought it was from our own artillery but later learned it was enemy shelling some 
 german infantry that we could see had retired to the railway station approximately two hundred yards east into the city 
 bricks and tiles were flying in all directions fortunately no shell made a direct hit on the roof above our 
 hideout prior to the shelling we had kept a guard on the stairway and back door relieving each other from 
 time to time as the strain became too intense in particular i remember the courage of monaghan off duty he 
 was always getting into one scrape or another but when under fire he was superb it has always been difficult 
 for me to remember names but the name of monaghan is dented into my memory as if graven in stone 
 finally the shelling stopped and there was absolute quiet with a cry of now s our chance we were out 
 the back door of the house as quickly as we had gotten into it leaping the fences we rejoined our 
 company at the site of the brewery our comrades said that we had been given up for dead or captured 
 we rejoiced to learn that there had been few casualties it was now nearing nightfall and difficult to believe that 
 these experiences had occupied the daylight hours of just one day that night the 42nd canadian battalion leapfrogged our position 
 and pressed on into the heart of the city our tired company followed into the city behind them all i 
 can recall is that by dawn i was getting to sleep in a small hotel with the pleasure of being 
 between white sheets at sometime past 11 a m i was awakened by lieutenant robbie robinson get up get up 
 hanny he called look out the window the armistice is signed the war is over incredible throughout these last hectic 
 days no word had come through to us that the war was about to be ended but it was true 
 too good to be true from the window i saw in the street below another never to be forgotten sight 
 masses of people were parading arm in arm and hand in hand other groups were in excited conversation bands were 
 playing belgium flags and bunting were being strung up everywhere never have three 
 104 colours appeared to me so beautiful as the rich red orange and black of the belgium national emblem among 
 ourselves we canadians were quietly congratulating 0:con 0:gratulating each for having come safely through a long war now some of 
 us said perhaps we may live to be eighty in the terrible years and days just ended possible death had 
 never been far away i remember a caption over an estaminet door a la terrible ans 1914 1918 now happily

 105 back to the battlefields 1 14 november 1968 p h ferguson it was a cool but bright morning when 
 the canadian contingent of first war veterans boarded the rcaf yukon that was to take the party to europe but 
 brighter still were the faces of that cheerful expectant crowd as they stepped on the tarmac and marched to the 
 waiting plane with a firm stride to the tune of tipperary yes it was a long way to go but 
 differing from wartime experiences all were certain of where they were going and equally certain of a safe return for 
 the administrative officers in the department of veterans affairs it lifted a bigger weight off their shoulders than they would 
 care to tell ninetyseven 0:ninety 0:seven men representing the same number of units that had comprised the canadian expeditionary force 
 in 1914 18 war had been safely tucked into the aeroplane together with some twenty four members of the conducting 
 staff the plane moved down the runway at exactly 8 10 a m and in a short time took to 
 the air next to me sat jim o neil from bowmanville ontario he was a lieutenant in the 19th battalion 
 and we had the opportunity of exchanging experiences in connection with the liberation and occupation of mons on my right 
 was the representative of the pay corps he was none other than r d whitmore obe the only original of 
 the patricias in ottawa he was wounded at bellewaerde ridge on may bth 1915 thus we had congenial company and 
 were well taken care of throughout the journey on arrival in brussels buses were on hand to transport the party 
 to hotels as soon as the preliminaries were attended to and immigration officials satisfied with our credentials despite the adjustment 
 in time a difference of six hours everyone seemed ready to turn in for a peaceful slumber and judging from 
 all appearances no one seemed to have suffered from this handicap it was realized that most of the men would 
 be tired after the trip so there was no programme arranged until the afternoon this gave us a free half 
 day to wander over the business section do a little shopping and get acquainted with our comrades most of the 
 veterans found different members of the party with whom they were previously acquainted and as we rubbed shoulders with each 
 other new friendships were forged with the usual exchange of wartime reminiscences 0:reminis 0:cences after the mid day luncheon the 
 buses appeared on the scene and we were ready for our first assignment as we drove out to the ghent 
 highway those of us who had been in brussels previously were amazed at the development of the city my own 
 recollections were rather vague i had not been there since i was with the battalion at genval during the last 
 half of december 1918 at that it was quite an outing to get a pass to brussels i recall being 
 very impressed with the design of the buildings and the old style architecture about the same time the third canadian 
 division held a grand ball in the same hall as that occupied by officials of the british army engaged in 
 a similar function when they were called away to the battle of waterloo quite some years before the first of 
 some fifteen ceremonies was held at the newfoundland memorial on the ghent highway between the village of halebeke and the 
 city of courtrai this was to commemorate the battle of lys a description of the ceremony merits attention in that 
 it set a pattern followed at all subsequent ceremonies those taking part included two chaplains from the brigade group in 
 germany namely major alex reid representing the protestant faith and major labrie the roman catholic chaplain while slight modification were 
 
 106 introduced at the different locations the ceremony commenced with the reading a short passage from the scriptures followed by 
 a prayer the two sentries corporal major and private peters 2 ppcli remaining at attention during the opening part of 
 the ceremony now reversed arms following this the last posl was sounded by the bugler corporal derrien 2 ppcli a 
 moments silence and then reveille the piper piper major hogg canadian black watch rhc then played the lament at its 
 conclusion the piper took his position with the flag party which consisted of the flag bearer lloyd k mudd a 
 veteran of the sth cmr battalion of montreal flanked by two members of the rcmp the final part of the 
 ceremony concerned the laying of wreaths the military wreaths bearer private rech 2 ppcli delivered the wreaths to the two 
 veterans assigned who after laying the wreaths returned to their place in the line the same procedure was followed in 
 the laying all five or more wreaths in honour of fallen comrades the first three wreaths laid were on behalf 
 of the government of canada veterans contingent and armed forces wreaths were also laid for the royal canadian legion and 
 national council of veterans of canada wreath laying completed one or the other of the chaplains closed with a prayer 
 on several occasions special features consisting of short addresses covering the story of wartime engagements associated with the memorial citations 
 concerning 0:concern 0:ing acts of valour by individuals historical background which led to the selection of the site of the 
 memorial were related these will be referred to in their proper place in this review following the saturday 2nd november 
 afternoon ceremony at the newfoundland 0:new 0:foundland memorial i left the party and boarded the train at courtrai for ypres 
 mr vierstraate recently appointed an honourary life member of the ppcli association provided me with accommodation when the veterans arrived 
 from lille the following morning i rejoined the party for the service in st george memorial church i shared with 
 the hon milton gregg vc the honour ot reading the scripture lessons the rev l m s powell ghent conducted 
 the service the church was filled to capacity with veterans members of the british community in ypres and a great 
 many visitors after the service we spent some time viewing the statuary the plaques and tablets placed there by british 
 canadian and commonwealth military units that had served in the salient most of the veterans present could recall service experience 
 in this area the statue of lord french the first commander in chiei of the british and commonwealth forces occupies 
 an important place at the rear of the sanctuary it was he who put forth the idea of building a 
 church as a memorial to the fallen rather than a stone or concrete memorial thus with tht influx of people 
 from britain serving with the commonwealth war graves commission the church has performed a worthy part in the religious life 
 of ypres likewise it serves as an historic shrine where strangers and tourists from abroad may meet rest awhile and 
 get information about the city and its surrounding battlefields among the plaques that attracted the interest of some of the 
 veterans was the one dedicated to sir winston churchill who had served as an officer in the salient in 1917 
 also the one to lieut col john mccrae with his poem flanders fields in copper lettering a plaque to the 
 canadian machine gun corps attracted attention by recalling the work of that doughty soldier brigadier general brutinel and his brilliant 
 service as its commander not the least of these symbols that attracted attention was the ppcli plaque in an alcove 
 at the back of the church it was unveiled in october of 1961 by the colonel in chief lady patricia 
 ramsay and on which is inscribed in memory of all ranks princess patricia s canadian light infantry who died in 
 the 1914 18 war and 
 107 the founder of the regiment brigadier a hamilton gault dso ed cd who served the regiment until his death 
 28 november 58 i was proud to be able to relate to those standing nearby that of the 5 000 
 men who served the regiment during that time 1272 were killed or died on the field of battle and the 
 names of over 500 are engraved on the menin gate as having a grave known but to god alone the 
 second ceremony for the canadian veterans that day was held at st julien the memorial stands among beautiful cedars where 
 the canadian first division suffered its first gas attack in april 1915 and held on until may 4th after suffering 
 heavy losses designed by f c c clemesha regina it differs from other canadian memorials in that it is a 
 single shaft rising 35 feet with the head of a canadian soldier in a bowed position at the top it 
 is sometimes referred to as the brooding soldier and several local memorials in canada have been copied from it nature 
 treated the contingent harshly at st julien in that it was the only clay in the two weeks stay in 
 europe that it rained though leaden skies and foggy weather generally prevailed however the veterans were given time to look 
 around view the beautiful setting and compare the terrain with that which they remembered when their reputation as volunteer soldiers 
 was in the making subsequent results of course showed how well they stood the test but not without great sacrifices 
 at the cloth hall in ypres members of the canadian contingent were guests of the burgermeister at a yin d 
 honneur this gave the veterans an opportunity 0:oppor 0:tunity to compare the elegant new structure with the old building shattered 
 with shells from the germany artillery during this event hon milton gregg vc presented the burgermeister an ancient document that 
 had been found in one of the cellars of ypres in 1916 by j m rowe of the 9th railway 
 transport it had received a careful face lifting in the dominion archives in ottawa and was quite readable part one 
 of the document contained the names of the members of st peters guild going back nearly 300 years to 1688 
 perhaps some pages were missing for the second part jumped to 1731 no information was offered as to whether or 
 not the organization still exists in any case such a society could hardly be expected to make use of the 
 information it revealed other than to trace the origin of some resident families following the official function at the cloth 
 hall veterans went to the menin gate where a ceremony was held at 5 p m this memorial gate which 
 replaced the old entrance to menin road through which the canadians marched often into disaster and death contains on its 
 columns the names of some 55 000 british and commonwealth soldiers who have no known graves of this number 7 
 024 are canadians differing from the vimy memorial the names are shown by battalions batteries or regiments the ppcli column 
 shows a total of 503 names a greater number than any other single unit at the hotel brittanque i was 
 invited to attend the annual dinner of the last post committee on this occasion i had the opportunity of meeting 
 nineteen of the business and professional people and their wives we had an excellent dinner followed by speeches and toasts 
 in a brief address i assured the members of the committee that i had been greatly impressed with the fine 
 work being done in maintaining the ritual at the menin gate and i felt that many in canada would be 
 glad to give it their support it was revealed that the cost of sounding the last post is approximately 6 
 000 00 per year and that current revenues from capital invested for this purpose only cover one half of this 
 amount on monday november 4th the party was transported from lille the contingent s headquarters to sanctuary wood for the 
 first ceremony at 10 
 108 o clock in the morning mr vierstraate kindly offered to drive me there going by way of bellewaerde lake 
 that we might view the patricia memorial commemorating 0:com 0:memorating the battle of frezenberg the withdrawal from plougon woods to 
 a new position at bellewaerde lake gave the battalion little time to prepare a new line when the german bombardment 
 started hence on may bth 1915 the regiment suffered its most devastating losses to date we found the frezenberg memorial 
 at bellewaerde to be in a well kept condition and the maple tree showing good growth we then proceeded to 
 sanctuary wood for the ceremonies there this canadian memorial is located at mt sorrell tor top where the enemy made 
 the break through on the c m r bth brigade front on june 2nd 1916 the patricias with two companies 
 in the appendix or apex of the salient were able to withdraw to the main line at warrington avenue and 
 hold their position at that point the memorial represents a tribute to all those who lost their lives in the 
 engagement from june 2nd when the battle started to june 12th when the recovery commenced the patricias lost in three 
 days over 400 men a few more than those of the previous may but among officers and non commissioned officers 
 the losses were greater dr gaenepeel described the action and the position in relation to other battle areas in the 
 salient in the afternoon ceremonies were held at tyne coe british cemetery and at passchendaele it was at passchendaele during 
 the cold wet months of october and early november 1917 the canadian losses exceed 16 000 before the ridge was 
 captured the pilgrims again had the benefit of a description of the engagement from dr gaenepeel it was intended that 
 we return to lille via armenteirs but owing to the lateness of the hour this arrangement was cancelled hence the 
 group had no opportunity of paying tribute to mademoiselle from armentiers or of viewing mr ph ferguson is seen presenting 
 a ppcli plaque to the burgermeister of ville sur haisne at a banquet held to honour the canadian representatives on 
 sunday the 10th of november 1968 
 109 the life sized sculpture on display in the hotel de ville it is proposed to erect this sculpture in 
 honour of that mythical figure whom few will accept as being one individual but rather a symbol of many who 
 served the troops in the estaminets 0:esta 0:minets and cafes of france in those days monchy lepreux was the first 
 place visited on tuesday the sth it was here that the royal newfoundland regiment had fought in the battle of 
 arras during april 1917 and through the action of a small party is credited with having saved the day in 
 that picturesque little village a favourite billeting area in world war 1 the stately caribou adds beauty to the rural 
 surrounding from monchy le preux the party took bus to dury which marked the victorious advance of canada s army 
 in the second battle of arras the scarpe and the break through to the drocourt line between august 26th and 
 september 2nd 1918 after spending the lunch hour in cambrai the first real ray of sunshine so far on the 
 pilgrimage seemed to disappear and clouds took possession it was a great disappointment to amateur photographers the next assignment at 
 masnieres marked the achievements of the brave newfoundlanders with the usual provincial symbol the caribou it was in this area 
 that they fought a defence action in the cambrai offensive of november 1917 they held the ground with 248 casualties 
 being the cost the visit to bourlon wood in the late afternoon was an interesting event the importance of the 
 action that led to the establishment of a memorial at this point cannot be overlooked it was one of the 
 great canadian triumphs in the last one hundred days of the war the action extended from september 27th to october 
 9th embraced the canal dv nord offensive the capture of cambrai and was the forerunner of the second stage of 
 operations leading to the fall of denain on october 19th and later on valenciennes and mons as one approaches the 
 wooded area with the memorial at the summit lime trees which had suffered from persistent bombardment during the war now 
 shade the path thanks to the application of expert tree surgery one approaches the monument by steep stone steps and 
 terraces cut into the embankment stately maples and conifers come into view as you reach the top and their age 
 old growth gives ruggedness and permanence to the setting it is indeed a beautiful spot and one would search far 
 for a more appropriate place to do honour to the men who laid down their lives at the very time 
 when the sweet fruits of final success were in the offing the land was the gift of the comte de 
 franquville who by a sad turn of fate was himself a victim of enemy torture and death in world war 
 ii while serving in the underground movement to liberate his countrymen one of the outstanding features of the ceremony that 
 took place was the presence of his widow his son with his wife and family to the comte and to 
 the members of his family present the deputy minister of veterans affairs paid a fitting tribute at the conclusion of 
 the ceremony and address the veterans were guests of the comteese at a community hall in the village where champagne 
 was served by a gracious hostess on november 6th a group of pilgrims went to wimmereaux for a service at 
 the graveside of lieutenant colonel john mccrae the author of flanders fields at beaumont hamel the newfoundland memorial stands on 
 a high cliff in a large park called after this famous regiment that suffered such heavy losses in the opening 
 battle of the somme on july ist 1916 indeed 684 of its battle strength were casualties and of this number 
 310 were killed or died of wounds it was probably the greatest loss sustained by any one battalion in the 
 great war in recognition of its sacrifice king george v gave the regiment the honour of using the word royal 
 as a part of its name it seemed fitting that the ppcli the first of the canadian battalions to see 
 service in the war zone should have 
 110 its representative lay a wreath at beaumont hamel in honour of a great regiment that had given so many 
 lives to protect our freedom time did not permit a survey of the park but one feature of interest is 
 the old trench system retained in its original form untouched by the hand of man in the newfoundland park there 
 is also a beautiful memorial to the 51st british division but time did not permit us to see it courcelette 
 was our next assignment an area associated with the canadian participation in the battle of the somme which commenced september 
 15th 1916 when tanks first went into action and extending to november 18th of the same year courcelette like poszieres 
 and other places is rebuilt showing none of the scars of war there is no evidence of the old sunken 
 road where so many patricias lost their lives on the first day of the battle at the memorial a number 
 of french school children had gathered to honour the canadians the royal newfoundland regiment had not fully recovered from its 
 devastating losses at beaumont hamel when they were called upon to take part in storming the trenches north of the 
 village of guedecourt the memorial established there is a fitting tribute to a regiment that had 239 casualties out of 
 a total strength of only 385 normally the equivalent of two companies on thursday november 7th the contingent was transported 
 to le quesnel where canadians took part in the opening phase of the offensive of august bth 1918 the guns 
 that opened up at 4 30 that morning did such effective work that the regiment was able to advance only 
 a distance of 8 kilometers 0:kilo 0:meters flanked by the amiens roye road on their right this led to the 
 engagement 0:engage 0:ment at parbillers where the gallant major drummond hay and many others were killed brigadier james a de 
 lalanne representing the legion and a former member of the regiment gave an interesting description of the action that day 
 there are two personal items worthy of mention an australian soldier was on the point of death on the day 
 of battle and r g perry of montreal offered to give his blood which saved the australian s life another 
 surprise awaited the regiment in the evening of august bth when the regiment reached its objective lieutenant colonel a hamilton 
 gault then a staff officer at ferfay and against specific instructions not to do so arrived on a motorcycle to 
 express his delight at the regiment s achievement he just couldn t stay out of the fight returning to amiens 
 for lunch the veterans were given a short time to view the cathedral regarded as one of the most magnificent 
 in europe the beautiful architecture of the building and the stained glass that adorns the interior was of great interest 
 to all in the cathedral is a single tablet placed on one of the main pillars in honour of the 
 royal canadian dragoons awaiting the arrival of the bus transport to vimy on november bth i was accosted by a 
 french civilian who expressed great surprise on seeing this large assembly of canadians he gave me an over sized card 
 on which was printed le commandant honore andre president lille branch of the national society medaille de france he was 
 greatly disappointed that he had no foreknowledge of our presence in lille had he known he told me a big 
 celebration would have been arranged this indicated the enthusiasm we found in many places when our presence came to the 
 attention of french and belgium people and particularly those who had served in the forces disappointment prevailed when heavy fog 
 covered the vimy monument on friday november bth however after the ceremony many looked over the artificial trench system and 
 the grange tunnel which many of us helped to excavate we were met there by two groups of canadian children 
 whose fathers are associated with shape headquarters near mons some of the teen age pupils 
 111 e quesnel france november 7 1968 p howard ferguson ppcli left and ac johnson 7fa presenting young frenchmen with 
 maple leaf buttons xpressed a great interest in the first war and one lad told me that what he saw 
 was a history lesson better than he would have received at school mrs betty hadden their attractive charge d affaires 
 was not present to hear this remark none are likely to lose marks returning to arras the veterans had a 
 chance to look around the town before the bus returned to lille the contingent was divided before leaving lille on 
 saturday november 9th 31 going to mons and 66 to paris the former represented those combatant units that had actually 
 taken part in the final battle at mons or were on the strength of their units at the armistice since 
 i belonged to the first group this review will deal only with the ceremonies there on sunday morning about 8 
 45 a bus picked up our group of 12 veterans and proceeded to ville sur haisne where we attended early 
 mass we were warned that the service might be a lengthy one but it concluded at about 10 30 permitting 
 us time to await the arrival of the 2 ppcli firing party colour party and corps of drums with major 
 r d macintosh in command with the veterans in the lead we marched down the hill to the site of 
 the price memorial a wreath was laid by the hon milton gregg vc and mr h badanai mp on the 
 belgium memorial while four veterans laid a wreath on the price memorial the death of private george price presumed to 
 be the last canadian shot before the armistice on that dramatic november day in 1918 was re enacted with vivid 
 reality and the firing party provided a military funeral settine for this gallant member of the 28th battalion lieutenant colonel 
 donald e mclntyre commanding officer at the time of the armistice gave the address explaining the background of this soldier 
 s career and the events that led to the action which 
 112 ended his life he then unveiled a plaque on the corner of the semi detached home into which price 
 was carried when he was hit by a sniper s bullet after the ceremony our party boarded the bus and 
 proceeded to the hotel de ville where burgermeister of ville sur haisne was our host at a yin d honneur 
 and each veteran was presented with a medal the medal of bronze with purple ribbon attached commemorates the armistice with 
 the years 1918 and 1968 stamped into the design together with the cross symbolizing sacrifice and the rising sun depicting 
 the beginning of a new era on the reverse side are the two majesties of the belgium royal house on 
 the same occasion attractive belgium girls passed to all canadians present a glass mug bearing the armistice inscription and a 
 reproduction of the canadian flag a number of civilian guests were present from mons and adjoining boroughs with whom we 
 enjoyed pleasant conversation included as a guest was a relative of the nursing sister long since passed away who attended 
 to private george price when he was stricken the party then took a bus to binache where an elaborate banquet 
 was given by the burgermeister and council of ville sur haisne place cards indicated that the veterans were the special 
 guests but there was a number of civilians who came in later to fill the tables opposite me was alex 
 sutherland proudly displaying the patricia insignia since he was at one time with the regiment accompanied 0:accom 0:panied by his 
 belgian wife he holds a position with the veterans organization in ghent and i found him a very jolly companion 
 george licompte curator of the mons museum attended this and other functions i had a very pleasant duty to discharge 
 during the banquet at binache it was to present to the burgermeister of ville sur haisne a regimental plaque containing 
 the burgermeister s name and the date of presentation in a brief address i explained that i had the honour 
 of representing the regiment which had formed a part of the 7th canadian brigade in the army of liberation armistice 
 day november 11th was of course the highlight of the pilgrimage for the veterans it was a busy day washed 
 and shined well in advance of the starting hour we were taken by bus to a street adjacent to the 
 grand place and from there moved into position on the grand place almost opposite the tribune d honneur with us 
 were some veterans from the united kingdom including some of the contemptibles who had served with the british army and 
 fought so gallantly at the ist battle of mons near us were the belgium buglers our own patricias with officers 
 and the corps of drums in their scarlet uniforms giving colour to the scene at the stroke of 11 o 
 clock the buglers sounded the last post following the silence the national anthems of each of the countries represented was 
 played australia united states france great britain italy luxembourg new zealand canada and belgium after the ceremonial part was completed 
 the burgomeister leo colard delivered a short speech followed by brief addresses from lieutenant general lonay of the belgium veterans 
 association and mr cote the deputy minister of veterans affairs for canada at the march past which followed brigadier general 
 john a clark took the salute in recognition of the part played by the 7th canadian brigade in the liberation 
 of mons fifty years earlier the 31 members of the canadian contingent soldiers and others that formed the parade entered 
 the gardens of the hotel de ville from the rear where cupid still stands as a silent sentinel we then 
 went to the annex where a yin d honneur was in full progress with many of the councillors and others 
 in attendance when the wine was finished and it seemed to disappear very quickly we moved into the large banquet 
 room of the hotel de ville there the soldiers canadian and british veterans the canadian ambassador to belgium and other 
 
 113 mportant personages formed an assembly of some 500 persons who were lavishly wined and dined emblems of the fifty 
 year old armistice were everywhere even the linen serviettes in the colours of canada provided the guests with suitable ouvenirs 
 of this historic occasion short speeches were given by brigadier general clark who at this time presented to the burgomeister 
 his war diary showing a record of operations under his command fifty years ago brigadier general stewart of the 3rd 
 division artillery who at nearly 92 was the oldest member of the canadian contingent was made a freeman of the 
 city an honour he accepted in a brief address other speakers included the burgomeister and leads of belgium organizations at 
 the conclusion of the banquet which ended about 4 30 we took the bus to the vicinity of the belfry 
 tower then followed the narrow foot path to he british memorial where a brief ceremony was held and wreaths laid 
 finally he party all assembled on the grand place where seats were provided for the eterans to hear and view 
 the 2 ppcli corps of drums play retreat no one could belong to the regiment without feeling proud of the 
 performance at he conclusion the canadian flag that had flown from its staff all day was iowered carefully folded and 
 in a dramatic closing ceremony was presented to he burgomeister by hon milton gregg vc thus ended a series of 
 events overing a period of ten days that may place another page in the history books of our fair dominion 
 for those who had the privilege of taking part the ceremonies 0:cere 0:monies the human contacts and lasting friendships are 
 experiences that will live ong in the minds and hearts of all of us the climax of the day was 
 the invitation extended to all veterans of the vlons group to accept the hospitality of the men and non commissioned 
 officers of second battalion at their quarters in l ecole de plein there we were treated to cocktails and light 
 refreshments when the party had assembled major dick macintosh the officer in charge of the 2 ppcli party called me 
 to the front and i was presented with a plaque bearing the badge of the regiment with my name and 
 date inscribed thereon in a few words of acceptance i spoke of the privilege of being the patricia representative in 
 the pilgrimage to the battlefields and of my great surprise in being so honoured i spoke of the excellent manner 
 in which the sentries and others discharged their duties at all ceremonies and the outstanding performance of the corps of 
 drums on the grand place it made me very proud to be a patricia when the regiment was formed we 
 were fortunate in having leaders like colonels farquhar buller and gault these men set a pattern that has been followed 
 throughout the years i thanked major macintosh and said that the plaque is a gift that i would treasure for 
 the rest of my days on november 12th preparations were made to depart for paris there to join the rest 
 of the contingent i still had a promise to fulfill namely to contact pere boulange a remaining member of a 
 mons family that had befriended number 4 company officers on the day of the occupation i had met an englishspeaking 
 0:english 0:speaking lady on armistice day and related my problems to her she proved to be a good samaritan she 
 and her husband picked me up at the hotel and drove me to the boulange residence where we found a 
 man of eighty living alone assisted occasionally by a housekeeper we had an agreeable chat he remembered 0:remem 0:bered the 
 canadians coming to his place where he once lived on the outskirts of the city and said he thought at 
 first that they were germans hence when they discovered who their visitors were the family showed hospitality in no uncertain 
 manner i pinned a canadian button with patricia colours on his lapel then he and his daughter who came in 
 later insisted on duplicating the hospitality the family displayed fifty years ago i toasted the old gentleman with the excellent 
 
 114 scotch whiskey they provided and said av revoir my lady benefactor gave me her card i failed to notice 
 the reverse side until i returned to canada here was the message you lost your old friends let the new 
 ones welcome you should you ever return some day to mons yes it was wonderful experience and i hope that 
 this account of the journey will give the veterans of world war i who served with the regiment in those 
 far off days some interest and pleasure in reading the above and if any shed some tears i shall understand 
 for i shed mine too morever i found in talking to serving members of the patricias a keen interest in

 will be authorized to look after regimental affairs the increment will likely be 1 officer 1 sergeant clerk 1 corporal 
 private gd 1 stenographer civ c arrangements have been made to locate the increment in building t 22 at currie 
 barracks calgary alberta the building will accommodate the regimental museum the regimental archives the reference library an orderly room the 
 kit shop national headquarters of the ppcli association d the disbandment of the depot will require considerable amendment to the 
 constitution of the regimental executive committee and the ppcli association complete amendment can best be made when the home battalion

 highlights experienced by the branch members was the annual frezenburg dinner and smoker this year unlike the past the members 
 of the edmonton branch were hosted by the ppcli depot officers wo s and senior nco s arrangements for this 
 memorable occasion were masterfully laid on by major whj stutt depot commanding officer and rsm ron king in the sergeants 
 mess delectable quantities of prime rib ham potatoes salads etc were served on regimental chinaware and appropriate goblets of a 
 fine old vintage had many members calling for second helpings we were delighted with the attendance of the ever popular 
 aw andy mills lt col ret who during the course of the evening was extremely busy renewing old acquaintances 
 137 another highlight experienced by branch members was the invitation extended by lcol am potts to branch members to attend 
 the all ranks ball on the 16th of march each member and his spouse were presented to lcol and mrs 
 potts during which our hosts chatted with each member individually it was a very delightful experience indeed the election of 
 officers to conduct branch business for the years 1969 and 1970 was held and the results are as follows president 
 jt dunn vice president hg hec edginton sec treas m muzz kozak executive members murray church mickey yost cornelius nuefeld 
 the change over of the branch executive took place on march 7 1969 and in his initial address president joe 
 dunn made the following proposals to the branch membership first that effective january 1 1969 all members of the edmonton 
 branch upon payment of their 1969 dues will receive a regimental lapel pin second any branch member who served with 
 the regiment during world war i will become an honourary life member of the edmonton branch third that a parade 
 to the city of edmonton cenotaph be held on saturday may 10 1969 by members of the edmonton branch to 
 commemorate the anniversary of the battle of frezenburg fourth that tentative plans be made for a delegation of edmonton members 
 to attend the trooping of the colour ceremony in calgary in the event that a ceremony will be held this 
 year a note of thanks was given to past president murray church and his executive for a job well done 
 and it was noted that murray and his executive had increased paid membership almost two fold since taking the chair 
 the branch mourns the passing of george macintosh who served with the regiment in ww i george was decorated with 
 the military medal and was severely wounded at the somme for many years george was sports editor of the edmonton 
 journal and covered his assignments with impartiality and sincerity he is missed by his comrades and readers we mourn also 
 the passing of beloved col hughie niven and we forwarded our condolence to the family the branch has started a 
 scrap book and photo album which will be used to record recent photos of branch members from year to year 
 and special mementos which effect the branch directly it is hoped that on completion of this project it will find 
 its way into the regimental museum the branch members were very disappointed when the regiment was moved from edmonton to 
 calgary however the loyal edmonton regiment 3 ppcli invited the edmonton branch to become members of their sergeants mess in 
 the ortona armoury this generous invitation was readily accepted and we now have access to the committee rooms for our 
 general meetings and are at liberty to socialize in the mess on the basis of our favourable experiences over the 
 past year the new executive under the direction and guidance of incumbent president joe dunn are looking to 1969 with 
 optimism and have scheduled an attractive program which we predict will see an increase in enthusiasm and membership honourary life

 arrived back in the ottawa area before the war had ended in 1918 this group was the nucleus of the 
 ottawa branch of the regimental association our records indicate that their first meeting was in the fall of 1918 to 
 discuss the possibility of having a reunion when the regiment returned home we are pleased to report that the same 
 spirit of 
 144 comeraderie is still flourishing as we cross the half century dateline we are financially barely solvent according to an 
 amateur auditor but endowed with a great wealth of memories friendships and lively interest in regimental affairs the following events 
 are recorded in our 1968 calendar an informal luncheon was held in early april although no specific reason is ever 
 required to get members together we were delighted to commemorate 0:commem 0:orate colonel s hill s 89th birthday on this 
 occasion our annual banquet was held at the board of trade on may bth our guest speaker was red o 
 quinn the general manager of the ottawa roughriders football team he said that he was most impressed with the champions 
 who came out of lansdowne park in 1914 and he promised that another kind of championship would come to lansdowne 
 park in 1968 we were pleased to note that this prophecy came true when the grey cup came to ottawa 
 our outstanding event during the 1968 activities was the annual meeting of the regimental association we were honoured to be 
 selected as the host branch for this memorable event general allard graciously consented to dine with us and he thoroughly 
 enjoyed his visit with his comrades in arms from the italian and korean campaigns from all accounts which we have 
 received the weekend of 14 15 september 0:sep 0:tember was an unqualified success the mood of happiness was contagious the 
 moments of remembrance were respectful the anecdotes were attractively embellished 0:embel 0:lished and on a few occasions the cause of 
 temperance suffered a noticeable set back following the annual meeting appropriate regimental plaques were presented 0:pre 0:sented on the association 
 s behalf by major wk stirling to officers messes at no 9 transport rcasc and the governor general s foot 
 guards these crested plaques are displayed prominently in each mess at the present time bill dawson presented to the branch 
 an attractive montage of pictures which were taken during the weekend of 14 15 september a similar framed one was 
 presented 0:pre 0:sented to general allard by our branch president colonel jr stone a special committee was appointed by the 
 branch to attempt to increase the membership during our fiftieth year of operations the members unanimously agreed to present all 
 our world war i veterans with a paid up life membership in our branch our fall smoker was attended by 
 the usual stalwarts r it was a very enjoyable evening and a fitting finale for 1968 activities we hereby report

 branch it s been a quiet year in montreal from the standpoint of meetings held by the branch only one 
 took place march 21 1968 but individual members have been kept busy with the stream of visitors which is a 
 feature of montreal life the abolition of cotc contingents raised fears that we might lose our old home in the 
 mcgill mess the university had other plans for it however a very loud protest spearheaded by patricia s has brought 
 a reprieve and it will remain almost intact our last formal meeting mentioned above brought a familiar and beloved visitor 
 george barclay he will be remembered gratefully by every one of us at the same time we said av revoir 
 but not goodbye to glenn bannerman who during his residence in montreal whilst working on expo 67 has been a 
 tower 
 146 of strength and a constant attendant some of us also welcomed dougie mac dougald on a visit from his 
 home in dorset england of course it can almost be said that we had a second meeting of the branch 
 when a large delegation travelled to ottawa in september to take part in the annual meeting of the national association 
 this inspired departure from the custom of holding a short and often very rushed session at the annual trooping at 
 regimental hq was largely due to george barclay s agitation to have it in the east for a change from 
 montreal we had among others jimmy de lalanne roy stevens clarence le lievre dennis jotcham gordon glassco bill perry jdw 
 boulanger from quebec sidney bruneau tom christian clarence picher stuart cobbett don mccullock bill stirling sr and rowan coleman as 
 always we have been delighted to see serving patricias from the canadian forces base across the river col george brown 
 s departure was deeply regretted as was that of major al wagstaffe however we still have a large important and 
 hospitable group who have included us in their regimental occasions their names are attached to our most recent address list 
 our next meeting will be at mcgill on the evening of thursday may 8 it would be wonderful to see 
 some of you from other branches in the meantime greetings to you all we regret to record the deaths of 
 two outstanding and devoted patricias w baxter keith at montreal september 1968 clarence d le lievre at montreal february 1969

 united kingdom branch we are now able to look back on 1968 and record the events of the year which 
 has passed on the bth of may frezenberg day our members met at the victory club marble arch london a 
 short annual general meeting was held presided over by our president lcol dh rosser this was followed by the annual 
 reunion lunch enjoyed by the twelve members present some of our wives came along to keep us in order at 
 this lunch we were able to welcome for the first time joseph neller who was 87 years old the previous 
 day we did not know of joe s existence until recently i wonder how many more there are we never 
 hear about present also were paddy o connell and eric michelmore these two and joe neller were all with ppcli 
 53 years ago it was grand to have them with us another 87 year old on the bth of may 
 1968 these originals sat down to dine together for the first time since they were separated on the battlefields in 
 1915 from the left sgt hf paddy o connell 875 tos nov 1914 wounded 8 may 1915 sos 12 may

 t keep these young fellows at home on the 11th of november armistice day three members of our branch re 
 wootton major holloway mc mm he led a patrol of 49th battalion into mons on november 9th 1918 and p 
 boxall attended the 50th anniversary armistice ceremonies at mons re wootton and p boxall visited ypres en route and on 
 november bth visited st georges memorial church sanctuary wood and frezenberg the maple at the memorial had of course lost 
 its leaves but is growing well the new directional signs to frezenberg are very helpful after attending the last post 
 ceremony at the menin gate they were entertained by mr and mrs verstraett at their home in ypres mr verstraett 
 is the burgermeister of ypres he was made an honourary life member of our association at the annual meeting in 
 ottawa on the 14th of october 1968 next day they journeyed on to mons and met members of the official 
 canadian party which included howard ferguson ppcli ottawa and jack blewett of the 49th battalion on november 10th they attended 
 ceremonies with the official party at le casteau about 5 miles from mons on monday november 11th they were joined 
 by major holloway and marched into the centre of mons with the official party led by 2 ppcli corps of 
 drums to take part in the mons celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the armistice of 1918 it is perhaps 
 worthy to note that these three 49ers all members of the uk branch of ppcli association were to the best 
 of our knowledge the only 1914 18 canadian veterans present from the united kingdom on this historic 0:his 0:toric occasion 
 so passed the 50th anniversary of the end of the great war we welcome 877 sid jennings and peter mclennan

 153 lcol hugh w niven dso mc lcol niven was commissioned prior to the first world war in the middlesex 
 light infantry of the canadian active militia he joined the princess patricia s canadian light infantry in august 1914 during 
 the early months in europe he was the transport officer and because of his efforts the battalion transport was the 
 best in the brigade he was mentioned in dispatches following the battle of the somme on 19 20 march 1915 
 he was appointed acting adjutant on 9 april 1915 and subsequently adjutant during the battle of bellawarde ridge 8 may 
 1915 subsequently commemorated as the battle of frezenberg command of the battalion fell to lt niven when the regiment was 
 relieved on the morning of the 9th lt niven commanded the remnants of the originals consisting of in addition to 
 himself 3 officers and 150 men a fitting tribute to the regiment and to the memory of lcol niven can 
 be found in canada in flanders by max aitken who in his account of the battle wrote beside the open 
 graves with heads uncovered all that was left of the battalion stood while lieut niven holding the colour of the 
 ppcli battered bloody but still intact recalled all that he could remember of the service for the dead for his 
 part in the battle of frezenberg lt niven was awarded the military cross he continued to command the battalion until 
 the arrival of lcol rt pellv on 14 may 1915 on june 2nd 1916 capt niven company commander took part 
 in the battle of sanctuary wood although wounded and with no company officers left he continued to fight his company 
 when relieved he reported to a dressing station and with his wound dressed set off to rejoin his company and 
 was immediately wounded again for his part in the battle of sanctuary wood he was again decorated this time with 
 the distinguished service order major niven became second in command during the first part of september 1917 subsequent to the 
 battle of passchendaele oct 29 30 1917 he was awarded a bar to the distinguished service order on the bcgiment 
 s return to ottawa in march of 1919 and its subsequent 0:sub 0:sequent reorganization major niven was accepted as a 
 major in the permanent force the regimental history records very little of lcol niven s tour as commanding officer of 
 the begiment from the 20th of january 1932 to the 15th of february 1937 there is no doubt that he 
 made his presence felt and in no small way advanced the traditions of what he fondly termed his regiment since 
 he retired in 1937 he has resided in glasgow scotland where he passed away on the 3rd of february 1969 
 at the age of 93 many men have experienced the honour and privilege of knowing lcol hw niven dso mc 
 and none will forget his love and unflagging dedication to his patricias he was continuously up to the time of 
 his death an unlimited source of regimental history one of those who served the ppcli has said of him hughie 
 niven was a patricia from the day he joined the regiment till the day he died a wonderful soldier friend 
 and comrade respected and loved by all who served with him what more can be said of any man 
 154 editor s note the two following letters were among the last letters received from lcol hw niven dso mc 
 before he passed away on the 3rd of february 1969 they are examples of many hundreds of letters he has 
 written over the years each one elaborating another facet of our regimental history col niven s letters are a source 
 of information and interest shared by many recipients the world over he carried on a lively correspondence with many patricias 
 and ex patricias right up to just before his death commanding officer ppcli hamilton gault barracks edmonton alberta may 4th 
 1968 dear sir your cable of greetings arrived today to remind us of our love of the begiment s great 
 days in the ypres salient it was a great day that the regiment saved the british army fom losing the 
 city of ypres that meant so much to the british forces at that time and all the commanders from lord 
 french down wrote us grand words of praise for the achievement the regiment had moved back from polygone wood to 
 a position with most inadequate three foot deep trenches but the intense gun fire soon made what trenches there were 
 useless the trenches were in sand along a road lined with trees to give the german army good target we 
 used our rifles while alive to good advantage but ran short of rifle ammunition and i had to employ men 
 to go across the front to get ammunition from rifle brigade trenches on our right as they had been forced 
 to retire behind the lake 400 yards from our line sgt dean the quartermaster did the ammunition 0:ammuni 0:tion job 
 i can still see him with a box of ammunition on his shoulder coming across the front to our line 
 several times he made the trip as if there was no war on the rapid fire of what were left 
 of our men was something to be very proud of and the germans suffered so much that what was left 
 of them retreated in quick time and called for more artillery fire as it was madness to attempt to advance 
 against the rapid fire from our line our machine guns were buried four times by shell fire dug out and 
 ready for next attempted advance lt clark i saw in charge of one machine gun and he was there when 
 i took our relief at dark we had a couple of hundred left after we buried our dead in the 
 trenches and i led them back to ypres in the darkness some four or five miles to the rampards of 
 ypres as a lieutenant i had the job of writing by hand no typewriter in those days to all the 
 families who had lost sons and husbands i did not get much sleep for a week and perhaps neglected doing 
 other jobs such as recommending worthy soldiers for decorations etc all senior officers were wounded and away it was ten 
 days later that major pellv rejoined us and took over command from me was i glad to see him is 
 putting it mildly there were so many things i should have done shell fire and rifle fire made no impression 
 on me at all and in those days i could write copy plate writing at good speed and mv messages 
 book of may bth was taken from me by the brigadier to be saved i never heard what happened to 
 it now see in those days the adjutants weight of paper and fvles were restricted to 40 pounds as all 
 had to be carried in a horse drawn vehicle and everything was weighted to a pound an officers bed roll 
 was limited to 40 pounds all his extra clothing with an extra tunic etc etc was put on a scale 
 and i saw that the horses were not overweighted to drag around swamped roads and it rained every day please 
 excuse paper still watch the weight it was grand of you to remember me after 53 years 
 155 i regret that after mv wounds they have caught up with me and i can t get around now 
 to every one of you i send greetings yours very sincerely hw niven ps i have been rather hasty over 
 this letter but there an odd thing has happened to me in that may bth i can remember all details 
 of that day after over 50 years and forget things of last week i hope i have not bored you 
 with this long remittance major whj stutt cd editor the patrician regimental journal hamilton gault barracks edmonton alberta dear major 
 stutt i wish to compliment you on the content of vol xx of the journal at my age 92 all 
 reports in the journal are of special interest to me who served from 1914 to 1936 in the regiment and 
 knew all the officers and men who won great fame during the first world war i am trying to remember 
 if more than a passing memory of one of our officers talbot papineau has appeared in the journal he was 
 a great officer and brought great credit to the regiment he was an oxford graduate and a very great orator 
 on the day of his joining his royal highness the duke of connaught gave a special mess dinner to the 
 regiment talbot had just joined that day and had not got a uniform so was dressed in dinner jacket after 
 the hrh had made a speech welcoming us all colonel farquhar replied 0:re 0:plied and major hamilton gault paid a 
 few well chosen words and it went right around the table papineau in dinner jacket was most reluctant to get 
 on his feet but his neighbors hoisted him up all the officers had thanked hrh for the bountious dinner and 
 sat down talbot hesitated and then started a flow of oratory about hrh about what the regiment would do to 
 bring credit to canada and become world famous hrh got up from his chair and walked to the bottom of 
 the table hoisted talbot on to his feet and said i have served all over the world and you are 
 the first officer i have ever met who could get on his feet and express himself properly i predict a 
 great future for you talbot was posted to no 3 company charlie stewart was there and agar adamson well after 
 i became adjutant talbot used to bring me sheets of foolscap with schemes to win the war but the colonel 
 buller picked too many holes and the scheme was out papineau was a very good officer worked hard and full 
 of ideas he was under two senior officers who did not give him much chance the canadian corps came under 
 an mfh general who had been mfh and his adc had won the great grand national both great horsemen wanted 
 an adc and we submitted papineau who had never been on a horse in his life to start with talbot 
 and the horses did not get on well but the first mess night he made a speech and all was 
 well great officer talbot came back to the regiment and took command of his company talbot was in command of 
 no 3 company at passchendaele and saw me before 3 company started the attack he said it was suicide and 
 i had to say ppcli have orders to attack but poor talbot while leading the attack was killed i saw 
 his body as i went forward to the crest of the hill to machete pill box now i am going 
 to say something i truly believe had papineau not been killed at passchendaele he would have been prime minister of 
 canada there is no doubt in my mind yours sincerely hw niven
