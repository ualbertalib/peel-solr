 the hudson s bay company made an to the pacific coast north to russian alaska south historic journey amund the
 world the little to mexican california then across the pacific to emperor as he was called had long cont m
 the hudson s bay company posts in hawaii plated a voyage which would demonstrate his from them he teturned to
 russian alaska then much vaunted ability to travel great distances in travelled across siberia and russia to st petersa short
 period of time not only did he wish to burg from there it was an easy trip to london visit
 the far flung posts of the company but he where he arrived on october 21 1842 wanted to addiess the
 pmblems which were deve prior to making the journey simpson had been loping in the oregon countly and to determine
 the suffering from a declining loss of vision particusuccess of his company s agreement with the rus lady in closeup
 work realizing that his projected sian american company trip would be an excellent subject for a book he at fifty
 four years of age simpson had just hugh dempsey the editor of simpson s essay is been knighted in recognition
 of his long cai er associate diiector of the glenbow museum calgaiy with the british company and saw his journey
 as and longtime editor of alberta history the illustration a diplomatic adventure above is an 1837 watercolour by alfred jacob
 miller entitled the blackfeet setting our fmm london on march 3 1841 he arranged for a clerk to accompany him
 so that he it must be placed in the context of the times when could dictate prodigious notes to him
 on the trip aboriginal peoples were seen by men like simpson from london to hawaii this role was filled by
 as being inferior to the higher cultures of eu edwani martin hopkins simpson s regular secm rope particularly of england
 the judeo christian taly work ethic the european style of mass warfare ultimately the various notes and journals were and
 a victorian sense of morality and chivalry placed in the hands of adam thom recorder of were the yardsticks used
 by men like simpson to rupert s land and archibald barclay secretary measure other peoples of the company and from
 their efforts came yet except for the odd references to the black narrative of a journey round the world during
 foot being wild and intractible indolent the years 1841 and 1842 published in london in notorious horse thieves and having
 bathamus 1847 as a source of information about simpson customs like all uncivilized and unchristianized and the fur trade the
 book is a something of a nations simpson is remarkably impartial and disappointment it is obvious that the editors sani
 generally quite flattering in his comments by tized and abbreviated the governor in chief s pithy overlooking he few biases
 which are present one comments and reduced the whole work to a bland can find that simpson offers some interesting
 and travelogue as glyndwr williams states important statements about blackfoot territoiy the style of the book is theirs thom and
 bar population warfare costumes division of labour clay and they appear to have been responsible sign language and other aspects
 of daily life unfor much of the subject matter particularly the doubtedly the information came to him fmm john numerous
 historical geographical and philo rowand and other veterans of the fur trade and sophicaldiscursions but in essence the book re
 has a relatively high degree of accuracy mains simpson s as an historical document this essay is signifi the extent
 of the editors revisions became evi cant in recording the way of life of the blackfoot dent in 1930 when
 the governor of the hudson s indians in the mid nineteenth century as per bay company charles v sale purchased
 a fool ceived by one of canada s famous fur traders scap journal containing hopkins s original manuscript as dictated
 to him by simpson this journal quickly revealed that not only had the style of writing been rendered more pretentious
 and turgid than the original 3 but significant portions had been deleted he essay among them was a 6 000
 word essay on the fort de prairie or edmonton being situated in blackfoot indians written at edmonton house on the
 country inhabited by the blackfeet is of course july 24 1841 and published here for the first the principal resort
 of those indians for the purtime the essay is contained in twenty three loose pose of trading their furs and
 provisions this pages as the back of the journal with additional seems therefoi a ver y fitting place to introduce
 inserts on separate pages these inserts have been a few particulars respecting this very interesting incorporated into the published essay
 in their people who have excited more curiosity than any proper places the reference for the material is other of
 the native tribes of north america but d 3 2 fos 129 144 hudson s bay co ar whose fate
 it has been to be represented or rather chives winnipeg misrepr esented by authors who were altogether the essay is
 important as an early document ignorant of them their country or customs and relating to the blackfoot indians earlier accounts
 who have drawn the character of the blackfoot had been written by such men as david thompson as consisting of
 ‘ a single virtue mid a thousand 1784 1812 alexander henry 1809 george crimes to right these indians in the
 eyes of the catlin 1832 and prince maximilian 1833 but world would require much labor and time i do the
 list is brief 4 not therefore pretend to give any lengthened in content he essay offers some interesting account of
 their manners and customs but shall comments about the blackfoot indians however merely in this place insert a few particulars
 res tribes have been veiy much overated sic even allowing that they have since then been greatly diminished one american
 author whose work ic cently appeared estimates them at 50 000 but even taking the extended sense in which the
 americans use the term blackfoot by which they include the crow and some other large tribes this appears too large

 as accurate as far as they go pox and other causes it is a number so insignifi the term blackfoot
 is very differently applied cant that one feels surprised how they have conby the english and the americans the latter

 one of these indians never speaks even to one of encampments and even watch and catch the his own family
 without using a sign for every horses but this they do cheerfully indeed they would blush to see their husbands
 demeaned by but they are often so attached to their horses that such offices their proper occupations being the they
 cannot be induced to part with them chace going to war horse racing etc ‘ they there was once a
 poor indian who sold a very are passionately fond of smoking and drinking and fine horse at edmonton and left
 the fort but he would sell all they possessed even their children quickly returned thr ew his arms around the

 in the surrounding country it and not allowing one aromatic fume to be lost the indian breed of horses is
 small but have in addition to hunting going to war and smok well formed limbs with fine coats and flowing

 and gambling amusements sideration cropping hese natural embellishments carried to the greatest extent among them until these horses have one
 deformity which offends indeed they become vices in their gambling the eye namely their big bellies but this arises however
 it must be said in their praise hat they from their living entirely on so bulky a food as maintain
 the strictest honor in the payment of their grass and is quickly remedied by a little hard stakes which often
 run high horses tents wives work or good food the indians make it an inall they possess in the world
 is sometimes risked variable custom either to bore a hole or split the at a single stake but having set
 their life upon ears of every fine horse and to brand them with a cast hey will stand the hazard

 really no authority made and the goods paid the seller has repented the authority of the chiefs however is veiy

 other successor as to use their own expres the blackfeet are constantly at war with some sion they become when
 unfit to lead to battle neighbouring tribe but their great and mortal nothing better than an old wife enemy is
 the powerful and bold cme nation the following instance of this custom may serve whose hunting gnunds adjoin their own
 sepaas an example and is applicable to the blackfeet rated only by the saskatchewan river when a although it occurred
 in another tribe where the peace is made between these two tribes it is almost instantly broken by one party
 or the other with all uncivilized and unchristianized nations as in the instance which recently occurred at the the barbarous
 custom of vicarious sacrifices pre race course the crees being a very large tribe vails so that the just often
 suffers for the unjust and having made more advances on civilization and so with the indians when one of their

 a midnight assassination sicj so that when few girls whose beauty is their preservation and once the avengers of blood
 are afoot no one in who are made captives and introduced to the the offending tribe can regard his life
 as safe for hareems of their victors in the year 1824 the an instant crees invaded the blackfeet lands and
 destroyed some of the blackfeet warriors are thought to no fewer than 900 of their enemy of both sexes be
 not only invulnerable but absolutely immortal and all ages in respect to arms the blackfeet are but as all these
 have in their turn paid their visit not veiy well off some of them indeed have guns to the grave
 it is difficult to conceive how this but are usually short of ammunition for the rest delusion has been maintained
 but it exists up to they have bows knives tomahawks and other the present day once there was a white
 man native weapons but shields which in former accompanying a band of blackfeet on a hard days when bows and
 arrows only were used in march in which one of these ball proof warriors warfare constituted an important item in

 by the indians at entirely laid aside the death of this immortal being they placed him the chivilry sicl of
 these indians has been in his tent with a bag of provisions his gun and lauded even to the skies
 so that one might sup a horse and then continued their march but very pose cowardice and treachery were unknown
 slowly constantly stopping and looking round amongst them but of course this is not the fact expecting that the warrior
 would overtake them that they are bold and courageous is without ques they assured the white man he was only
 gone on tion but they will not run the risk of an encounter a visit to the land of spirits
 but at the end of a with a superior foe in open fight nor will they week as he did
 not return they concluded he attack a well armed though small party of whites found himself in such good company
 hat he had although they may greatly outnumber them but taken up his permanent abode in the next world they
 will not hesitate to cut off stragglers or soli they therefore left the spot and continued their tary trappers steal
 horses etc etc being quite march as rapidly as possible ignorant of the laws of the chivalry laws quite of
 the religion of the blackfeet it is vety diffiunknown in the glens of the rocky mountains cult to give any
 definite account they appear to they will adopt any device or trickery to compass have some idea of a ruling
 power or providence an enemy and when once the demon of revenge exercising a contml over all mundane affairs who
 has been nused within their breasts they admit is influenced by their prayers and offerings they of no atonement but
 blood and blood they will have also some anticipation of future rewards and shed however meanly or cruelly it may
 be done punishments there is one thing however certain that they are polytheists in a most extended sense after all
 their notions on both morality and of the word eveiything that is new or curious to religion are exceedingly lax
 but that they believe them is immediately regarded as a natoose or in a future existence is clear as will
 appear from god 2 to which they will at once offer up their the following ciitumstance a young blood indian
 prayers thus for instance when they first saw the took a wife and in due course of time they were
 cocks and hens at edmonton they prayed to blessed with a child which however after a short them most devoutly
 by the hour and when shown existence expired the father addressing his wife some pictures on a wall they did
 the same said our poor child is so young that it is imposplacing their hands close to them and then
 stmking sible he can find his way alone to the sandbank their breasts by which means the good qualities heaven
 let us thetefore join him so that we may of the paintings like a spark of electricity were save him
 from being lost the woman like a transferred to them they pray to the sun moon true indian wife merely
 replied let it be as you and stars and the whole host of heaven but the will and i mained
 unmoved whilst he unsheathed moon appears to be their chief diety 2 and his scalping knife and plunged it into
 her bosom although it has been asserted that there is no as soon as she fell he drove his knife
 to his own authenticated instance of indians making sacrifices heart 23 the woman as it proved was not morto their
 gods it is nevertheless certain that the tally wounded and was subsequently married to plain tribes have a custom of
 presenting as offer one of the company s servants ings to the moon joints of their fingers their the belief
 in a future existence is common to blood oblations of rum etc etc and this they the crees also the
 following instance of which do to obtain success in war or in hunting or else may be cited and it
 will also serve to demonstrate when mourning for the death of a friend or rela that those indians are not
 altogether devoid of tive 22 those feelings and affections which are felt by civi george catlin recorded this view when
 travelling to the upper waters of the missouri river in 1831 it shows a blackfoot medicine man ministering to a
 member of his tribe who was wounded in battle lized beings a brave cree lost his favorite wife who confessed
 that after watching every opporhe refused to mourn over her body saying i must tunity but in vain to remove
 the children they go to her we cannot live separated i will soon had contrived to slip them into a
 pair of saddle rejoin her next spring a war party of crees in bags and carried them thmugh the gates
 without vaded the blackfoot countly at length they came being discovered in sight of a large encampment of their enemy
 as speaking of their religion it seems right to when the widower who was amongst their num mention a few
 of their social rites and customs ber snatched a gun from one of his companions as a general rule it
 may be said that they are very tell my friends said he what i have done kindly disposed to each
 other and possess great i am going to join my wife he immediately natural affections but their moral chamcter is
 at dashed among the blackfeet one of whom he a very low ebb naturally arising from the life they killed
 but was the next instant cut to pieces lead as a people advance in refinement so does in connection with
 their religion it may be the female sex rise in importance and by this scale noticed that their medicine men
 possess great in we may judge of the moral condition of a nation fluence over the minds of the plains
 tribes whose amongst the untutored savages of america we of magic arts are continually resorted to heal the sick course
 find the women degraded and despised obtain success in war etc these indians may be amongst the plain tribes polygamy

 in relation to edmonton anti majority of their professions and a small fluondationists many elements clearly match noisy and often
 hysterical minority this group anti fluoridationists in edmonton incorporated a encompassed reactionaries who frequently also wide variety of fears and
 concerns many of which opposed measures such as vaccination and chlohad nothing to do with fluoridation into their rination of

 sell and wanted scientific tone present in much of the literature some free publicity maclean s also asserted that the

 movement other than that of boosting per mained on the active listing until 197 sonal prestige of the three anti
 fluoridation leaders the most observations by other authors were similarly prominent was cornelia wood she was born in unsubstantiated a
 maclean ‘ s article saw anti missouri in 1894 and moved to stony plain in fluondationists as a small collection
 of relatively 1904 in 1913 she became a founding member treatment was also supposedly able to cure coronary thrombosis and
 tuberculosis in humans and mastitis in cows mrs wood worked fmm the mid 1930 s to the early 1940 s
 to bring this cure to alberta giving up only when it became glaringly obvious that it was worthless the edmonton
 local council of women was opposed to fluoridation in 1953 but the extent of p its activities is unknown 5
 it is quite possible that the movement contained sub groups with different fears motives and social features the social credit
 party of alberta came out officially against fluoridation in 1962 and had instituted the legislation calling for a two thirds
 majority to implement the measure in 1952 on the other hand almost all scientific dental and medical associations went on
 record as supporting fluoridation these included the american association for the advancement of science the american medical association the american
 dental association the american cancer society the canadian dental association the canadian medical association the canadian pharmaceutical association the association
 of municipalities of alberta the alberta public health association the irs ornelia v 4 ood m l 4 for stony

 at the time as to have a oppose the measure perhaps because they were negligible effect as well well able
 to pay their dental bills and could see while organized religion was rarely a factor no benefit from fluoridation 54
 however religious ideals did have an effect a occupation was another factor white collar number of people objected to fluoridation
 as unworkers tended to be far morn suppottive of fluori christian and believed that it was contrary to dation than
 any other occupational group 55 the god s wishes 59 somewhat surprisingly political fact that lower income groups who stood
 to gain preference appeared to be unconnected to interest the most from fluoridation were generally op in or opinion about
 fluoridation given the firm posed may stem in part from the fact that mem stance against fluoridation taken for many
 years bers of this group generally have a lower level by the social credit party in alberta one might of
 education rendering them more susceptible to expect that people who tended to vote social the emotional and anti intellectual appeals
 of anti credit would oppose fluoridation in edmonton fluoridationists this is in line with the general as clsewhere however political
 preference had tendency of low income uneducated people to little effect upon voting on fluoridation this fear and resist change
 this group may have felt applies only to political preference and not to those powerless and manipulated by a faceless

 finally property r espect anti fluoridationists were similar to other ownership seems to have had little bearing upon right wing

 56 possible reasons for this are that older collar professionals tended to be much more in people would be less
 likely to perceive benefits favour of fluoridation than any other group in edto themselves resulting from this measure and monton
 overall according to a 1961 study 47 might also see themselves as more prone to many peitent of eligible voters
 were definitely in favour of the diseases such as cancer or heart disease while only 17 percent were definitely opposed
 which were alleged to be caused by fluoridation this left 36 percent uncommitted or indifferent as well older people might
 be more intimidated leaving great potential for a swing vote which by the massive technological changes of the could be
 particularly devastating to pro fluoridaperiod age of children was another factor those tion forces when a two thirds majority had

 a series of three articles on the life of dr charles h mckenzie he was born in watford ontario in
 1897 and moved to the okotoks high river area where these reminiscences begin after receiving his medical degree from the
 university of alberta where the third section of the reminiscences end he practised in the coal branch area of western
 alberta his experiences there were the subject of an article doctor in the coal branch published in the spring 1985
 issue of alberta history he then moved to saskatchewan and an account of his experiences there was published under the
 title reminiscences of dr charles mckenzie in saskatchewn history spring 1985 dr mckenzie moved to minneapolis where he practised gynecology
 and obstetrics for thirty years he died in 1980 these reminiscences were prepared by his daughter based on dr mckenzie
 ‘ s writings sometime during my wonderful eighteen a six year course the first year consisted of premonths teaching in
 longview in 1918 19 i de medical subjects followed by two years of acadecided to go to university and take
 the medical mic medical courses two years of clinical medicourse it wasn t a sudden decision i was alone cal
 courses and a final year in hospital as a junior much of the time and was able to think and
 con interne sixty of us who were enrolled would be sider what i had seen and learned i also read
 the first class that would have the privilege of many books and thought about them i was still taking all
 six years of medical school at the very religious and ever since hearing taylor stat university of alberta before this
 the last three ten during his ymca campaign six years earlier years had to be taken at mcgill university the
 i had thought i might be a missionary books university of toronto or the university of about david livingstone led
 me to thoughts to be manitoba coming a medical missionary i also thought a lot it was arranged that i
 would live with my aunt about my time in the royal flying corps army edna and uncle frank livingstone aunt
 edna life and the wide world had shocked a little sense was mother s youngest sister they lived near into
 me and knocked out some of my insufferable the south end of the high level bridge just a few arrogance
 but i was still pretty proud of myself blocks from the university uncle frank was the during the physical examinations
 for the rfc manager of the rexall store on first and jasper i had been intrigued with the prestige of
 the doc unfortunately for me he was promoted to manators they always seemed to have the final say ger of
 all rexall drug stoles in western canada i think the desire for prestige was one of the fac about two
 months after my arrival and the family tors in my decision to take up medicine prestige moved away from edmonton
 i then found that impressed me i think i have always accepted po an old school chum gordon saunders fmm
 okositions which tickled my vanity and which i toks was looking for a place to live together we thought added
 to my prestige found a bednom in the home of an english couple whatever the true reasons for my decision
 in and we ate our meals in the huge dining room at the fall of 1920 i enrolled in the
 medical school athabasca hall on the campus gordon and i at the university of alberta in edmonton it was tdomed
 together during four of our medical school years and remained fast friends all our lives we certainly gained a lot
 of practical knowledge during that first year of medical school i formed and good friendships in many ways that second
 friendships that lasted a lifetime although we year was the best i spent at the university being rarely met in
 later years besides gordon there in residence i began to learn a little more of the was angus mcgugan mike

 the thirty students who passed to the kingsley macdonald noel sulis eddie tucker second year and jeff mckay i had
 such an appetite that i while i was away at school father mother could eat anything and enjoy it but
 there was and george had made the big decision to go farm constant minor grumbling about the food i ing
 years earlier about 1910 father had bought r emember one spring evening when the waiters a piece of canadian pacific
 railway land about brought in large platters of spinach with twelve thirty miles east of innisfail on base line 24
 six fried eggs planted on each platter tom dyer a miles west of huxley and elnora george and senior took
 one look and said come on boys father had built up a good business in calgary he stood up and
 left the dining hail we all foland their chevrolet garage had pmspered george lowed along with five hundred others i
 thin k the had become an excellent mechanic and had col food did improve after that or at least there
 were lected a fine set of tools in addition they had no more meals of spinach with fried eggs collected
 a good bit of farm machinery through a group of professors ate at the head table at trade and pumhase
 in 1920 they decided it was breakfast and lunch we more or less str aggled in time to have a
 look at that piece of cpr land and ate but for dinner we all stood until the senior george and
 father drove up to see the land liked professor said grace the grace was in latin and it rented and
 later bought the next quarter sec although we never successfully translated it nor tion that had a house and barn
 on it and arranged probably learned it correctly it went approxito move onto the property in the spring of 1921
 mately mother was pleased she had never liked living hoc cibo refecti in towns or cities and always preferred the
 farm quaecumque vern george and father traded cars for horses and constantius cows sold the home in high river and
 shipped sequamur everything north early in the spring i agreed to secundum ei come down to he farm as soon
 as school was out chnsti spiritum that fall i went back to medical school gordon at this point you would
 hear the scraping of six saunders and i decided to live in one of the stu hundred chairs on the
 tile floor dent residences and were assigned to athabasca a hall this was the first building constructed at the men
 university of alberta in 1911 and originally all that year was the most social of all my years the classes
 were held there by 1921 it was the at college gordon and i went to all the university main residence
 hail we had two rooms just two sport events and were always in the itioting section doors down the hail
 from the main entrance and for basketball rugby and hockey we attended close to the dining room we used one
 room for all the meetings of the union the medical club a bedroom and the other for a study our
 study and other university functions like saturday night becai ne a popular gathering place befoie and after dances and formals
 meals and many debates and stories went around our class was the first to work and hear lectures that room
 it may have kept us fmm working but in the new medical building that had been finished we would have
 no crop that meant that i could not return to medical school in the fall for i had used up
 all my money during the first two years and now father would not be able to help out i heard
 that red deer school needed a grade 8 teacher and i was hired to act as assistant principal under principal
 locke i found a good boarding house at the hempsteads met my fellow teachers reviewed the grade 8 workload and
 was all set to teach for ten months at 150 per month it seemed a good salary and i believed
 that my year in grade 12 was beginning to pay just as dr tory had predicted the forty children in
 my grade 8 class were some of the brightest i ever came across we reader were the ancient manner and

 enough to keep huge bonfires burning to thaw it enough only one person in the class misspelled water to excavate
 on some occasions they even had to milton spelled it watter i felt i had to keep blast the frozen
 ground in order to continue build my word so at noon i dismissed the others wmte ing in the fall
 of 1921 the building was finished w a t e r three times high on he blackboard and we were
 proud to be the first occupants and told milton to go ahead and begin writing we studied organic chemistry with

 that our whole class busy hospital miss jennings had an office just had passed fourteen of us now we could
 placinside the main door and registered and admitted tice medicine in alberta however we also all the patients today she
 would probably be wanted to try the medical council exams if we cajied a receptionist everyone knew her the doc
 passed those we would qualify to practice meditors greeted her as they entered or left the hospi cine anywhere in
 canada or in the whole british tal and left messages with her sometimes when empii the councils were written in
 june so we staff was short she took newly admitted patients still had two weeks to study i got a
 room at the to the wards and even made up their bed her white block my time at the royal
 alex was pleasant smile and energy made her the most finished and i studied our whole class passed popular person

 it didn t seem possible of course i escorted like a good idea my best girl said she would her
 home and asked to see her again for the rest write so i wrote to the doctor dr p a
 macof the term i saw her frequently donald and was accepted mail service complaint is made that the mail which
 reaches calgary on sunday and wednesday nights is seldom bmught through to edmonton on monday s and thursday s train
 particularly if the main line train is late this thmws correspondence three and four days late respectively which is a
 serious matter when all correspondence can only be answered three days after arrival the importance of the edmonton mail is
 such as to warrant the placing of an edmonton mail bag on the main line train so that if the
 trains made connections the mail would also certainly the railway mail clerks have as much time to sort the edmonton
 mail on the trip fmm moosomin to calgary as the calgary clerks have in the few hours intervening between the
