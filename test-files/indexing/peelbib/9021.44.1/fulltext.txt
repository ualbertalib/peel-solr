 ct 1 v 1 jifj by debbie mains i many writers have portrayed southern alberta as a natural grazing land 
 lv kelly in his book the range men described the area as having wide sweeps of rich grasses well watered 
 plains fine winters and unlimited range in an 1894 address to a montreal audience dr d m mceachran portrayed alberta 
 as a prime grazing land consisting of grass i covered hills open stretches of country with coulees and water courses 
 changing the land into a magnificent rolling grass country 2 he described the thick matted abundant bunch grass as being 
 very nutritious and if allowed to dry and cure on the stocks would provide natural hay john george kootenai brown 
 was reported to have told senator matthew h cochrane who was visiting from quebec that where buffalo thrived cattle will 
 do the same 3 he also warned there will be some hard winters 4 above in southwestern alberta during the 
 l 870 s there were two factors blocking c em gardner of pirmez creek was a well homesteading and cattle 
 ranching the known cowboy and a leading canadian first was the existence of indians who contender in the 1912 calgary 
 stampede still legally occupied the area and followed their livelihood of pursuing the buffalo treaty number seven signed september 22 
 1877 effectively resolved this matter in return for surrendering their lands to the government the indians selected reserves and were 
 promised support should hard times come the other inhibitor to settlement was the vast alberta history winter 1996 
 herds of roaming buffalo deliberate by tom lynch george emerson 1 g slaughter reduced them substantially and baker and company 
 and others the the cowboy adapted to his by 1879 the few remaining herds were cattle dnver s first task 
 was to assemble a situated in midwestern montana crew of good dependable cowboys who knew the ways of the cattle 
 environment and became the as the nomadic indians and the buffalo consequently they hired experienced were no longer an impediment 
 to cowboys from the united states an subject of admiration this has ranching small herds of range cattle example of 
 hiring such men occurred were introduced to southern alberta in when tom lynch engaged the famous created a western image 
 which 1876 joseph mcfarland brought a small black cowboy john ware doubting that herd of cattle to fort macleod where 
 he the man could even saddle a horse much is very popular in today s established the pioneer ranch a 
 year less ride it lynch nevertheless received later fred kanouse brought twenty one proof of ware s skill and hired 
 him the society cows and a bull from montana and cowboy soon proved his ability successfully wintered them on the 
 open range george emerson and tom lynch the large ranches sought the best men later known as king of the 
 north west they could get they obtained cattle drives drove small herds of cattle experienced stockmen by hiring from montana 
 to fort macleod and later american trailsmen cowboys to work at to fort edmonton these ranchers found the ranches following 
 the cattle drives a ready market for the cattle from local and by appealing to the montana settlers and the 
 north west mounted cattlemen s association for the best police encouraged by the success of stockrnen they had 6 these 
 american their small cattle drives emerson and cowboys not only brought experience lynch drove a thousand head of cattle but 
 also characteristic manners and from montana to the highwood river customs many of which had been there they established their 
 own herd inherited from the early spanish cowboy and despite sceptic warnings that the these customs and characteristics were winters 
 were too severe or the starving moulded and adopted to suit the indians would kill the cattle the herd environment 
 on the frontier thrived the cowboy s distinctive dress was soon reports of the ocean like expanses described in an 
 1894 lethbridge news ijut ii of unoccupied grass 5 reached eastern paper article entitled spring canada and britain these reports 
 roundup 7 the news article reported attracted prospective cattle barons such that the cowboys presented a as senator cochrane from 
 quebec the allans from montreal and the walronds decidedly picturesque not to say from england eventually large herds of brigandish 
 appearance with their cattle between three and seven red blue and grey flannel shirts thousand head were being driven from 
 canvas trousers leather chaparejos montana or idaho into southern alberta broad sombreros coloured silk hand many of these cattle drives 
 were headed kerchiefs knotted around their necks alberta history winter 1996

 the elements but could be adapted to feed and water stock fan a camp fire signal a comrade and balance 
 a cowboy riding a bucking bronco another aspect of cowboy life was music which was both popular and practical as 
 cowboys were known to be men of a few words they could express their feelings in a song singing had 
 a soothing effect on cattle could quell the dangers of a stampede and could be used to signal fellow herdsmen 
 primarily though singing kept the night herdsman awake while on guard duty and relieved the monotony of job and the 
 loneliness of working alone l v kelly describes cowboys as very loyal to their employers they treated the employer s 
 stock as if it were their own a theft was regarded as a personal loss and a mark against the 
 cowboy s character in response to criticisms written about cowboys a former cowboy wrote an article in the mac cod 
 gazette to educate the public and to defend his fellow workers these he said were respectable men earning honest and 
 useful livings in the cattle business 2 he explained that the name cowboy originated in texas and referred to the 
 necessity of being a healthy active young man to endure the rigorous outdoor life of herding and handling cattle raised 
 wild on the prairie he differentiated between cowboys working on the range range men and those herding and driving cattle 
 on the trail trail men some cattle drives lasted up to six months at speeds of eight to ten miles 
 per day the cattle drives demanded tremendous human stamina to stay with the job until it was 
 completed the author felt that bucking and consisted of one hundred men horses were a vice peculiar to western fifteen 
 mess wagons and five hundred horses and likened their actions to the saddle horses this outfit rounded up gyrations of 
 a buck deer killing a 60 000 head of cattle however the snake 3 venture was considered too large to 
 be done satisfactorily and it was decided the roundup was described in an 1891 that future roundups would be done 
 in lethbridge news article as the chief districts event in the life of a western cowboy 4 as the cattle 
 and horses on the range roundups gave cowboys from different were allowed to roam over the prairie outfits an opportunity 
 to challenge each during the winter they wandered far other to roping contests steer throwing from home the roundup therefore

 where the when john ware seized a runaway long young calves were skillfully roped then horn steer twisted its head 
 to throw the branded and castrated if necessary beast off balance and then wrestled it onto its side 9 ware

 and laborious than the riding ware was declared the star spring one because the cowboys were athlete that day the 
 following year in cutting out adult stock versus calves 1893 a scheduled contest in roping and steer wrestling was held 
 in conjunction the first roundup in southern alberta with the summer fair was in the fort macleod area in august 
 1879 and was described by kelly as a cowboys appreciated the feeling of poor enough roundup outfit consisting freedom sensed 
 when riding across the of sixteen very indifferently mounted open range ranchers and cowboys men and one wagon 7 each 
 man had resented the settlers arrival because they only one mount and limited provisions ploughed under and destroyed the once 
 tile result was very discouraging as plentiful bunch grass cowboys also many of tile cattle put on the range in 
 the hated barbwire fences that the settlers previous fall could not be located erected as they prevented the cattle from 
 grazing freely and also contributed to tile this initial effort contrasted with the cowboys feelings of loss of freedom greatest
