 rites unmarried anglophone priests would be needed so priests both ukrainian and some roman he recruited students at st augustine

 to sixteen fated attempt to establish a republic in finally he established a diocesan the ukraine following the collapse of

 less than cordial many of the first wave had been iii i ‘ ‘ another group that occupied the interned
 during world war one because archbishop s attention were the they came from the austrian occupied ukrainian catholics also known
 as part of the ukraine technically that rutheniians or greek catholics in the made them enemies but most had no
 1891 1914 period many ukrainians love for the germans and some 10 000 settled the prairies two thirds belonged served
 in allied forces in spite of this one of archbishop o leary s first to the ruthenian rite which celebrated
 canadian citizens showed mixed tasks in the edmonton area was to keep greek mass permitted a married feelings protestant nationalists
 such as ukrainian catholics in the fbld priesthood but acknowledged the anglican bishop george e lloyd below is a methodist
 ukrainian church supremacy of the pope initially the included the ukrainians among those at pakan which is typical of the
 ukrainian catholics came without dirty ignorant garlic smelling competition offered by protestant priests this made them vulnerable to unpreferred continentals
 4 also among groups proselytization by protestants russian the catholics there was fear that budka orthodox and others as a
 result the would allow a married priesthood roman catholics were forced to come to despite the pope s ruling against
 such in the new world the ukrainians settled in large blocks in all the prairie provinces those immigrants to alberta
 were mostly located north east of edmonton where they had built their cathedral at mundare o leary s interest in
 them seems to have been purely religious these people were not attracted to the french given the historic enmity between
 them and the poles who were allies of france also the west was english and increasingly so therefore like most
 ethnic groups they took on the dominant language writing to louis in 1925 the archbishop of edmonton stated that we
 are having a very hard fight here to save the ruthenians specifically o leary s concern was based on the
 responsibility that he and archbishop alberta history autumn 1996 alfred a sinnott of winnipeg had taken for the greek catholics
 to expedite this work o leary used his connection with the canadian catholic extension in toronto to get money not
 only for his needs but also for the other rite for example on march 1 1923 he contacted extension pointing
 out that the methodists were building halls and holding sunday schools in north edmonton a ukrainian catholic area an even
 greater threat arose in june 1925 when host of the elements of the methodist presbyterian and congregationalist churches joined to
 form the united church of canada stating that it was doing a great patriotic service in its attempt to unite
 the many races the young when he arrived in sicl in the west the united church set edmonton the local
 separate i e aside a 4 000 000 war chest regarding catholic educational system consisted w en 0 eary arrive
 this o leary stated that he did not need of eight elementary schools and a single millions of dollars but
 only many high school as well as a dozen private edmonton the local separate thousands and that this money would
 be schools run by religious orders these split between edmonton and winnipeg latter institutions usually functioned as i e catholic
 educational thus the ukrainians could be shown junior seminaries o leary immediately that they did not have to change their
 took a direct and personal interest in all system consisted of eight religion to become canadians such instruction like other
 separate furthering this labour the archbishop systems edmonton s finances were elementary schools and a single had the sisters of
 the atonement help precarious however unlike ontario the the ruthenians at smoky lake and alberta catholics had the right to
 a share high school established a boarding school in of corporation taxes the rub being that edmonton for those greek
 catholic there was no obligation for firms to split boys who took their high school courses what they owed between
 the public and in the city b ç 0:c 1927 it had more than separate boards then in 1925 the forty
 students fortunes of the edmonton separate school board changed when one this phase of o leary s relationship company decided
 to split its taxes with the ruthenians seems to have others followed including pat burns ended with the departure of
 budka for meat packing operation in edmonton the ukraine in late 1927 his replacement as bishop one and a half

 10 per pastor of st josaphat s church in cent pay cut to keep the separate school edmonton although the
 battle was far tax rate competitive i e below the from over at least o leary had helped public system
 the archbishop had no stem the tide now as 1930 approached trouble getting the sisters to sacrifice for above he
 had to concentrate on the soon to be the next world but the lay teachers were view of the catholic
 separate high overwhelming problems of his own not so easy to convince many having school in edmonton diocese families to

 days the teachers agreed to accept a held the ukrainians o leary also had to vacuous promise of a bonus

 of getting enough money to construct follow the very slow growth of the city the college which was to be
 named st therefore by the late 1920 s there were joseph s the archbishop recruited five new schools and more
 than 2 000 father john a macdonald from students in a system which was still antigonish nova scotia assigning him
 minuscule in comparison to the public the task of approaching the carnegie schools the 1930 s would provide it corporation

 o leary at right is seen education in north america initially here with fellow clergy at the opening regarding higher
 education the offered only 50 000 as a matching of the library at the new cathedral in archbishop discovered very
 early that grant o leary apparently used his skills march 1926 at centre is james catholic students at the university
