 called for three whiskeys for his friends grease i could beg from the railway officials in and himself and a

 i told the steward ship i avoided ever y one of them as though they not to bring anything for

 this past week there has been a good deal of discontent here in consequence of some conduct on the part
 of an officer of the n w m p perfectly bona fide and honest perhaps but most mistaken in judgment
 a man named ross had a horse stolen from him three years ago this horse he found a few days
 ago in the possession of one muirhead a contractor who was on his way to fort macleod ross seized his
 horse and took him to the police station and proceeded to find witnesses to prove that the horse was his
 a task in which there was no difficulty whatever when he went back to the station he found that the
 commanding officer let muirhead have the horse when he remonstrated with the colonel the latter s reply was muirhead is
 a responsible man and therefore i have let him have the horse but i protest colonel cried ross there is
 no use in your protesting sir said the colonel what i have done i have done at least one hundred
 people urged on ross to seize the horse and assured him that come what might they would support him mr
 lougheed the barrister searched everywhere for the colonel to add his protests and this capable young barrister declared that a
 more outrageous thing he never heard of it is not time this paternal justice should cease is this russia regina

 interesting particulars of a rich find of oil in the northwest came to hand today by a letter received by
 alfred patrick late clerk of the house of commons from his son major allen poyntz patrick dominion topographical surveyor of
 calgar y the letter says for eleven weeks we have been prospecting among mountains for coa l oil deposits i
 am happy to say we have been eminently successful we have located a considerable quantity of oil lands some on
 the eastern slope and some on the british columbia side so soon as as we felt perfectly certain and justified
 as to the importance of our discoveries we took the necessar y precaution to have several of the samples assayed
 the result is 91 per cent of lubricating oil 6 per cent water and three per cent foreign matter this
 is the best oil ever discovered far ahead of the pennsylvania oil fields i have made a choice and registered
 in my own name forty acres on this side the summit and about 500 acres in british columbia also two
 other claims not yet surveyed being about 4 500 feet above the sea level the crude oil can be run
 off in pipes any distance i understand the galt company have stated that they will lay pipes for us to
 lethbridge free if we will pump the oil for them capital is all that is wanted all our oil lands
 are within easy reach of the railway it is the greatest find ever known lethbridge news july 31 1889 27

 from don wetherell editor of the society s newsletter in order to create better communication among the chapters the society
 decided in 1979 to publish a modest newsletter i became the editor and the first issue came out in january
 1980 the newsletter was from the beginning a flexible forum it attempted to create communication among the members of the
 society and to respond to their needs one example of that response was that shortly after publication began members wer
 e encour aged to place free advertisements relating to heritage concerns in the newsletter many were from people tr ying
 to complete their collections of alberta history and apparently the newsletter was effective in meeting that need other advertisements concerned
 research projects conferences local history books and the like additionally the newsletter ran relatively short articles on chapter activities the
 heritage preservation movement and historical resource facilities in alberta all of these were in an attempt to meet the interests
 and commitments of the members unfortunately the increasingly worrisome state of the society s funds has created a situation where
 the newsletter must be sacrificed in order to correct current imbalances shortly after we began publication postal rates increased dramatically
 nearly doubling the cost of each issue we then began distributing the newsletter as part of the chapter mailings but
 now even that expense is too high and the executive of the society has decided to cease publication of the
 newsletter i want to thank all of you who contributed to the newsletter over the past years and to the
 membership who found i trust that the newsletter was a useful complement to the other benefits that they have received
