 my dear patricias i am very honoured to provide the opening remarks for this year s patrician 2009 was another 
 very challenging year for the regiment as a good number of you spent the majority of the year deployed to 
 afghanistan with the task force 5 09 headquarters returning only recently and thankfully in time to enjoy the much deserved 
 holidays with family and friends the vast majority of you spent the year either conducting or directly supporting the training 
 for the current deployment for those of you now deployed being away from your families and friends is undoubtedly difficult 
 be very proud of your service campaigning alongside our international and afghan allies in pursuit of a brighter future those 
 of you who are not deployed have certainly not been idle in any regard support to those deployed planning and 
 training for the 2010 olympics and the continuous preparation for inevitable future tasks and deployments have kept you extremely busy 
 although we have suffered loss this year on the battlefield and at home amongst our serving and our retired we 
 must be proud of how honourably our regiment remembers all those who serve and have served i believe it gives 
 us strength to know that sacrifice and duty shall never be forgotten simultaneously i am heartened by the stories of 
 valour discipline leadership motivation and commitment that now comprise our modern history exemplifying the warrior spirit patricias at home and 
 abroad continue to triumph in the face of great adversity it was truly a pleasure to have had such wonderful 
 opportunities over this past year to visit with so many of you i cherish the time spent with the serving 
 regiment and with the ppcli association the 95th anniversary celebrations in early may hosted by the ppcli association in edmonton 
 were particularly enjoyable i thank each and every one of you for your devotion to duty and excellent service to 
 canada i appreciate and am deeply grateful for the incredible sacrifices you and your families are making to provide canada 
 s security i consider myself both privileged and extremely proud to be your colonel in chief and as such to 
 serve as a member of our fine regiment yours faithfully adrienne clarkson 
 5 the patrician 2009 message from the colonel of the regiment brigadier general j e l gollner omm cd during 
 2009 we marked the 95th anniversary of our regiment s founding for the serving members operational demands and training meant 
 that our celebrations were muted our anniversary celebrations came together at our association s annual general meeting agm held in 
 edmonton over the 8 may weekend at the agm and related social events we were able to mark both the 
 95th anniversary and the 94th anniversary of frezenberg good representation from both edmonton based battalions was evident throughout the weekend 
 2009 saw the first battalion battle group and the third battalion operational liaison and mentoring team omlt on the road 
 to war deployment began in september and continued for six weeks the coming year will see the third battalion start 
 on the road to war with early deployment in 2011 planned the third battalion being a light battalion is currently 
 converting to a laviii battalion second battalion s year was active too with the battalion developing a series of afghan 
 based tactical scenarios and field firing ranges for the first battalion battle group training in suffield in the spring after 
 this successful training the battalion then began focusing on and training for their olympic security role in whistler bc the 
 battalion also trained and deployed a company as the provincial reconstruction team for the first battalion battle group during 2010 
 second battalion will train an omlt for deployment with the third battalion in early 2011 congratulations to all members that 
 have received recognition for gallantry and service during 2009 coverage on their individual gallantry decorations and meritorious service awards is 
 set out in this patrician one of our member s unique awards stands out and as such deserves special mention 
 in november wo william macdonald smv cd received the vimy award for 2009 wo mac donald s gallantry had earlier 
 been recognized with the star of military valour the vimy award to wo macdonald was the first time a non 
 commissioned member of the canadian forces has received this award the conference of defence associations awards the vimy award each 
 year to a member of the canadian forces that has contributed significantly to the defence of canada this year acting 
 on your behalf i appointed mr don cherry as an honorary patricia as you may have seen on coaches corner 
 don frequently mentions the regiment and its members don has done some fine tributes to our fallen comrades on his 
 program just before christmas our colonel in chief the right honorable madame adrienne clarkson was rushed to hospital with a 
 severe gallbladder attack unfortunately shortly after successful surgery and return home complications arose these complications resulted in madame clarkson being 
 in hospital over the christmas holidays i have been in regular contact with her and she has asked me to 
 tell you that she is determined to get herself ready for her duty in 2010 as 2009 closes we are 
 in the early days of the american surge in afghanistan with the americans now assisting us in kandahar we might 
 be better able to achieve our mission hard campaigning lies ahead as our recent casualties have sadly shown our success 
 as always depends on our hard training and intelligent application of our knowledge discipline skills and diligent leadership and above 
 all remembering that we are patricia soldiers good soldiering for the coming year j e l gollner colonel of the 
 regiment the cor and cds get ready to run with the olympic torch 
 6 the patrician 2009 message from the regimental major major h j s mandaher cd this is my first message 
 as the editor of the patrician i am deeply honoured to have been given the opportunity to serve as the 
 regimental major as i have learned over the last few months it is a busy job with fluid priorities limited 
 resources and seemingly unlimited bosses i wish tp thank major jeff bird my predecessor for his advice and support in 
 making my transition into the job seem effortless without his planning and guidance to get me on the right track 
 quickly you would be reading the 2009 patrician sometime in 2011 the bulk of the work for the patrician is 
 done by corporal daryl willetts it would be remiss of me if i did not publicly acknowledge his diligent efforts 
 to collect unit submissions and get them formatted for printing unfortunately his job for the next issue will be even 
 harder as we try to get back to our normal publication timeline in a little over six months the publication 
 of the 2009 patrician was delayed by design until the return of task force 3 09 the last chalk arrived 
 in edmonton on 1 june 2010 tf 3 09 involved the deployment of ppcli soldiers from all three battalions based 
 on 1 ppcli bg as this issue goes to print edmonton and shilo based units prepare to welcome home our 
 heroes and hold memorial services for our fallen comrades after the brief gatherings for ceremonies including a change of command 
 for 1 ppcli tf 3 09 soldiers will be on well deserved leave for most of july immediately after their 
 leave 1 ppcli will re organize and start the training cycle all over again in order to augment the 3 
 ppcli based tf 1 11 the afghanistan war continues to demand the best from the modern soldier without fail the 
 regiment has lived up to its historic prowess deployment after deployment and fielded the best soldiers in the world the 
 regiment will continue to provide the best led best trained soldiers because anything less is not the patricia way mayor

 we received had tanachoy as the objective and 3 platoon as the lead element in the assault after travelling through 
 the dark and conducting some quick recoveries due to the terrain the small village was eventually in our sights as 
 3 platoon started its attack they quickly became the hunted as a recoilless rifle had taken out three of the 
 platoon s lavs and one from coy hq however after some quick decisive actions the attack was complete an d 
 we held the village the days following the attack we began to work with the local villagers which proved to 
 be trying but also helpful a coy was able to get a taste of how to interact with local nationals

 coy departed for afghanistan in the early days of september the coy moved to masum gharto conduct a relief ln 
 place with b coy of the second battalion r22er the handover given was excellent and many of their lessons learned

 its main task in april as the tf stepped out the door to canadian forces base suffield for ex desert

 intense experience which culminated in a successful level seven brigade offensive operation against a soviet style foe immediately following this

 that is canada administration company having worked and trained continuously for more than a year admin coy was ready to 
 flex its muscles in september with its much anticipated deployment to afghanistan the road to war was not an easy 
 one as anyone in admin coy can attest to between september and december the soldiers of admin coy have been 
 at the forefront and in the background of every major op that the tf 3 09 bg has been a 
 part of in kandahar they are spread throughout the entire bg ao in every forward operating base and in every 
 patrol base from the maintainers recovering vehicles under threat of enemy attack to the drivers bringing supplies to remote patrol 
 bases on ied littered roads to the supply techs and administrators pushing assets and supplies forward the soldiers of admin 
 coy have been working tirelessly to keep the bg moving 
 the patrician 2009 33 ivp afghanistan in the fall and winter has presented new challenges forthe maintainers and drivers since 
 november there has been a steady flow of rain which when mixed with the very fine dust of southern afghanistan 
 turns to a very thick mud however admin coy keeps on trucking the soldiers of transport platoon have also been 
 working at a very high tempo equipped with the new ahsvs transport platoon has been critical to the bg in 
 providing integral assets to the sub unit echelons in order to resupply and sustain the battle forward the supply techs 
 have also had their fill of hard work in afghanistan effectively managing and prioritizing stock that is always in limited 
 supply the days are long in afghanistan and there are no holidays or weekends to break up the work week 
 on occasion the soldiers of admin coy get together for barbecues to relax unwind and enjoy each others company the 
 real satisfaction for these soldiers though is in knowing that the soldiers of the bg have everything they need and 
 are able to carry on with any mission anywhere and anytime trade pioneers trades pioneers have had a very busy 
 year working on many different projects which benefit the regiment and its members one project of particular interest to patricia 
 s is the newly added history book display located at the edmonton international airport initially mwo butters had approached trades 
 wanting a display created for the edmonton airport to advertise for the regiment s 100 th anniversary sgt renwick made 
 the suggestion that it look like a book to signify the regiment s lucrative history the concept was used and 
 with the generous support from gary chanin of chanin hardwoods trades were able to create the display sgt renwick working 
 on the ribs of the display 
 34 the patrician 2009 ivp mr chanin donated all the hardwood lumber and the aircraft plywood that was used to 
 construct the pages of the book the base and the top light cap are made from jatoba the finished project 
 would not have been as impressive without the high quality of material that mr chanin provided the completed project comes 
 apart in four sections the top light cap can be removed and the pages are completely separate sections the base 
 is a part in itself trades are also in the process of making four more pages for the display that 
 can be switched out when needed each new page will depict a new chapter in the regiments history starting in

 links all patricia s 2009 was a busy year for the second battalion of the princess patricia s canadian light 
 infantry ppcli once again the second battalion saw action as elements of the unit deployed for another rotation to afghanistan 
 in addition the rest of the second battalion worked tirelessly to prepare the 1 ppcli battle group for their deployment 
 while simultaneously preparing themselves to support the upcoming 2010 vancouver olympic games 2009 was a year of great accomplishments but 
 also one marred with sacrifice 2009 is a year that will live long in the memory of the soldiers of 
 the second battalion following the return from christmas leave in january the second battalion participated in exercise strong contender this 
 was an exciting event for the battalion as we appeared in fullstrength 0:full 0:strength rather than the skeleton crew that 
 attended the competition last year which coincided with our deployment to tf 1 08 0:1 0:08 2 ppcli made a 
 strong showing in all areas posting strong results against the other lfwa units the second battalion brought home gold medals 
 in volleyball and soccer as well as securing the 3rd place overall major unit award this was an impressive accomplishment

 ppcli s gold medal winning soccer team the second battalion began their major training cycle in the spring taking a 
 key role in the planning and execution of exercise desert ram in suffield ex desert ram represented a major component 
 of the 1 cmbg road to war model the exercise involved the construction of a massive range designed to provide 
 the soldiers with a realistic contemporary training environment to challenge their skills and abilities in preparation for deployment to afghanistan 
 the second battalion with the support of 13 field squadron began construction of this range back in early march this 
 exercise gave our soldiers an opportunity to share their wealth of knowledge and experiences from their recent mission in afghanistan 
 with the elements scheduled to deploy in the fall of 2009 it involved a range of scenarios from asymmetric tasks 
 including key leader engagements and led threats to decisive combat operations the second battalion also underwent some leadership changes during 
 the summer of 2009 this was marked by the change of command of 2 ppcli on 25 june 2009 lieutenant 
 colonel shane schreiber took command of the second battalion from lieutenant colonel dave corbould lcol schreiber began his career in 
 the second battalion where he served on the un peacekeeping force in cyprus unficyp since then he has held a 
 number of positions including most recently when he served as a company commander in the 3 ppcli battle group in

 command 25 june 2009 
 the patrician 2009 37 2vp the period following summer block leave was a busy time for the second battalion as 
 they were faced with two major tasks on the horizon the first task was preparing a company to support tf 
 3 09 provincial reconstruction team the second task was preparing the rest of the battalion to support op podium in 
 providing security for the 2010 winter olympic games in vancouver this preparation included the conduct of primary combat function or 
 pcf training as part of this the second battalion was fortunate enough to be selected to run the first course 
 for the light armoured vehicle remote weapons system or lav rws the co and rsm debating the pros and cons 
 of domestic operations in whistler the task of running this pilot course fell to the soldiers of c company the 
 lav rws is a bison replacement that includes increased armour and the new remote weapons system the changes include a 
 new passenger seating and restraint system however the hallmark feature of the new lav rws is the remotely controlled turret 
 that can be mounted with a c 9 c 6 or a 0 50 calibre hmg the lav rws gunners 
 and drivers trained by c company expect to utilize their new skill sets while deployed on tf 3 09 while 
 the soldiers on the ground were training and honing their soldier skills the command and planning teams were off in 
 vancouver and whistler conducting their initial recce for op podium op podium promises to be a large and challenging task 
 as the second battalion prepares to make the transition from the wartime footing to supporting a domestic operation the leadership 
 and the soldiers worked hard to ensure that this transition was made as effectively as possible and that the second 
 battalion was prepared for their new task this summer also marked the regiments 95th anniversary since its inception in 1914 
 when hamilton gault donated 100 000 of his personal funds to raise and equip a regiment for service in the 
 great war to commemorate this event c company decided to demonstrate their regimental pride and to honour the commitment made 
 by hamilton gault to create the princess patricia s canadian light infantry preparation included a number of build up runs 
 including a 15km run to test the soldiers and build their confidence before the event c company s gritty preparation 
 culminated in their company half marathon led by major j t adair oc c company c coys half marathon

 centres ortoc s the operational tempo picked up rapidly with training on the bv 206 s 0:bv 0:206 0:s and 
 preparation and conduct of ex kapyong grizzly and ex kapyong sasquatch which gave the second battalion s soldiers an opportunity 
 to complete their ibts training and fine tune their soldiering skills this cumulative field training kept the second battalion busy 
 and in the field for much of the fall and early winter of 2009 this year was also marked by 
 the sacrifice of a number of our regimental brothers among them was the second battalion s own sergeant shane schofield 
 and private garrett chidley our thoughts and prayers are with their families and loved ones their sacrifices will not be 
 forgotten 2009 was a memorable year for the second battalion it was a year filled with great accomplishments tireless service 
 to canada and to the regiment and marked with the selfless sacrifices of our soldiers unfortunately there is little time 
 to dwell on our successes of the past year as 2010 presents the second battalion with a new crop of 
 challenges including an early deployment to bc for op podium continued support for tf 3 09 and preparation for the

 after the 2002 tour a civilian supporter of the battalion mr joseph green took it upon himself to contact the 
 canadian space agency csa to see if it was possible to have the flag flown up in space in 2006 
 dr maclean although being very limited in what he could take to space brought the flag up there with him 
 on mission sts 115 afterwards the csa invited mr green the co and rsm of 3 ppcli and i to

 the continual flow of soldier qualification basic military qualification dpi infantry as well as combat service support related courses ensured 
 that there was never a dull moment the personnel challenges posed by the ongoing deployments to afghanistan as well as 
 support to joint task force games were felt as the out flow of soldiers postings retirements operational taskings etc and 
 the reduced inflow of soldiers posted in caused significant challenges for permanent staff to overcome as a result as seen 
 in most other units this caused the staff of lfwatc to often be double or triple hatted and work long 
 strenuous hours nonetheless thanks to the dedication and professionalism of the permanent staff of lfwa tc all courses were successfully 
 completed and hundreds of new soldiers were trained or qualified for canada s future requirements headquarters maintained its continuity with 
 lcol scott morrison royal canadian artillery remaining as the commanding officer and cwo art chase continuing on as the rsm

 many challenges and changes during the tour nato implemented partnering ie pairing a nato battalion with an ana battalion thus 
 broadening the mentor s role to include facilitating a daily isaf working relationship with afghans regardless ensuring that the afghan 
 national army was the solution and playing a key role in all security operations was first and foremost in our 
 approach whether it was organizing community shuras or planning and conducting deliberate operations we did so with our afghan brothers 
 in the spirit of respect and commitment to the cause of improved security for the afghan people our soldiers performed 
 with skill and a work ethic that was the envy of the afghan national army and our nato allies in

 tfk headquarters 5 09 commanded by bgen jon vance and cwo stan stappleford was taken from 1 canadian mechanized brigade 
 group icmbg headquarters and as such was well served by patricias in a number of key operational positions the road 
 to war for the hq began in august of 2008 although for those drawn from icmbg hq a great deal 
 of preparation had already taken place for the chief of operations lcol mike patrick no less than three turns within 
 the hicon in wainwright preceded the deployment tfk hq 5 09 s actual pre deployment training saw moves to wainwright 
 for exercise maple guardian to monterey california for focused pd and to kingston for exercise unified ready at the conclusion 
 of the latter the cls pronounced the hq operationally ready for deployment with pre deployment leave taken the headquarters began 
 its flow into theatre in late january 2009 although it was intuitively understood that the pace of operations would be 
 heightened the reality of the operational tempo was impressive exemplary of this not two weeks following the 19 february transfer 
 of command to tfk hq 5 09 operation jalay a combined air and ground assault consisting of the greater portions 
 of two brigades was conceived and launched into central zhari district this represented the largest canadian led combat operation in 
 afghanistan at the time marking the real commencement of operations under tfk hq 5 09 the pace never diminished under 
 the expert guidance of maj kevin mcloughlin the tfk g 5 the plans branch completed in excess of 100 planning 
 cycles averaging an operation every 2 5 days tfk hq 5 09 was witness to and facilitated a number of 
 fundamental changes to the mission a significant increase in coalition forces within the former canadian area of operations ao assistance 
 to the afghanled 0:afghan 0:led national elections and a switch in operational focus to population centric counter insurgency to name 
 but a few all took place during the tour key to engineering tfk s major operational level efforts was the 
 j 5 branch ably served by majors quentin innis harpal manny mandaher and jim caruana tactically tfk hq 5 09 
 consistently acquitted itself well not in small part to the excellent battle management exhibited by the joint operations centre joc 
 and its key personnel including our istar officer maj kevin barry and joc senior duty officer capt spencer sharpe shaping 
 tfk plans and conducting detailed liaison and coordination with provincial authorities was the responsibility of the provincial operational coordination centre 
 occ p and was pivotal to the success enjoyed throughout the tour this organization in keeping with the mission underwent 
 a number of changes and grew in size and capability throughout tfk hq 5 09 s time in theatre mwo 
 craig green ushered this diverse organization throughout its mission ensuring that its diverse members were cohesive and effective 99 tac 
 taking a break to discuss future plans perhaps the busiest organization within tfk hq 5 09 turned out to be 
 the visits cell a non stop stream of high profile influential national and international military and civilian dignitaries came to 
 observe the progress of the mission and the superb work of the soldiers within the various task forces under tfk 
 essential to the smooth running of this cell were cpls greg van sevenant and kevin deveau who tirelessly shuttled dignitaries 
 about the battle space and back filled the commander s tactical cp when needed 
 the patrician 2009 51 tfk hq 5 09 the remainder of patricias within the hq had the crucial responsibility of

 exit theatre unscathed on 3 july 2009 99 tac while commanding the operations of 1 12 us infantry in western 
 zhari district struck an improvised explosive device several members of the tac were injured and cpl bulger was killed the 
 loss of cpl bulger was a blow to the whole of tfk hq 5 09 and was felt keenly by 
 all of the hq patricias notwithstanding the pain of the loss of this fine soldier it was during this time 
 that the value of the extended regimental family was most evident tfk hq members conduct repatriation ceremony for fallen comrade 
 cpl n bulger tfk hq 5 09 departed theatre officially on 19 november justifiably proud of the manner in which 
 it facilitated general vance s command and control of the mission and satisfied that the way had been defined for 
 further progress of course not all of the successes of the mission are directly attributable to patricias but without doubt 
 the regiment played prominently within them all vp

 all of which are secondary duties the co is lcol terry wilson d comd of ctc the rsm is cwo 
 tim penney rsm of the lfaatc the adjutant is capt kevin schamuhn standards officer at the infantry school and the 
 newly appointed qmsi is mwo seymour csm of hq coy at the infantry school in 2009 the infantry school faced 
 three main factors that resulted in the unavoidable and drastic reduction of the tempo for the end of the 09 
 10 fiscal year first the army s recruiting push to replenish the ranks seems to have slowed down and lessened 
 the immediate need for new infantry officers second the army imposed budget restrictions have severely affected the school s ability 
 to run training but arguably the most significant factor is the army s requirement to conduct security tasks for the 
 olympics during op podium that has left units with an unprecedented amount of no fills for advanced training courses as 
 a result of these main factors the majority of courses scheduled to run at the infantry school during the 2010 
 winter trimester have been cancelled a rare rest period will occupy the winter months during which time the infantry school 
 staff will participate in a variety of pcf courses aimed at increasing the school s pool of qualified soldiers a 
 potential opportunity for ski school may present itself depending on the creativity and imagination of the log o in any 
 case early 2010 will be an opportunity for all staff to enjoy the much needed opportunity to improve and develop 
 training material and to spend time with their families french grey battalion patricias 
 53 the patrician 2009 french grey battalion several members of the french grey battalion assisted with the atlantic area ppcli 
 association function which took place from 11 13 september in gagetown the guest speaker was bgen retired vince kennedy who 
 briefed the gathering about the fast approaching 100 th anniversary of the regiment the meeting also served to provide an 
 overview of the regiment s current status for serving and retired members of the ppcli another briefing of interest took 
 place right after christmas when lt col grossman was hosted by the infantry school to deliver his bulletproof mind presentation 
 it has become common for canadian battle groups to host lt col grossman as part of pre deployment training but 
 rarely has his message been delivered upon returning to canada as the percentage of ctc instructors with combat experience continues 
 to rise the intent of the briefing was to focus on the aspects of mental injuries during the redeployment process 
 lt col grossman s briefing was very well received and was followed by presentations from 42 health services and the 
 jpsu together the presenters painted a picture of what types of injuries to expect and how to effectively deal with 
 them one unfortunate aspect of training soldiers at the infantry school is that at some point given the current nature 
 of canada s mission in afghanistan we are bound to lose men and women that have passed through our doors 
 of note are lt justin boyes who was killed on 28 october 2009 by an led and lt andrew nuttall 
 who was killed on 23 december 2009 also by an led both officers were recent graduates from dp 1 2 
 although the majority of instructors at the school now have combat experience it is a unique grief when a soldier 
 is killed doing the very thing we as instructors have trained them to do these men along with cpl nicholas

 a tall building i say i don t play games that s what i have all of you siblings for 
 but with youthful persistence they don t let it go ok ok if you had to would you rather own 
 a pug or a pitbull truth is i hate questions where regardless of the answer you give it won t 
 paint a pretty picture but i love my kids every day one spends in ottawa can be like spending a 
 day with my kids impossible questions are continually being asked for which regardless of your answer it seems impossible to 
 paint that pretty picture and yet i love this place of course i am only one of many particias here 
 in the national capital region and admittedly should not use my own experience to speak for all the others but 
 i ll do it anyway think of my experience as being representative you see i believe that even those who 
 openly begrudge having been posted to ottawa soon secretly grow to love this place and even in some cases the

 all are educational many are challenging some are interesting a few are even rewarding but every one of them i 
 m told can trace a line some obvious others less so back to life in a battalion that is to 
 say everything we do here we do with the intention of improving the lives of our fellow soldiers in mind 
 some of us know that line will lead back to a life in battalion while others cling to it knowing 
 it will only get longer but regardless of whether we are here for one posting bungee line or are in 
 it for the long haul thread line with a gordian knot and despite being spread out all over the region 
 the sense of being a patricia of being family remains in 1960 the twilight zone aired an episode titled a 
 nice place to visit in it the protagonist a certain petty thief named rocky valentine believes he has gone to 
 heaven after having lived a far less than lucky life finding himself in a place where everything appears to finally 
 be going his way rocky begins to relax of course as with all episodes there is a twist and rocky 
 is wrong it doesn t take him too long to figure it out either i mention this not because i 
 want to draw a parallel between the life of mr valentine and a patricia s life here in ottawa i 
 don t i never even saw the episode i just felt an extra paragraph was needed for this entry when 
 i set out to write this article i told myself i would not focus on the time honoured right to 
 pretend that being posted to ottawa is like getting the hini vaccine 2009 reference it doesn t hurt at first 
 but a little while later you re not so sure like i said i don t buy it this is 
 a great place to be it s where great and not as great but still pretty darn good patricias abound 
 and we re all here busily doing all manner of things 
 the patrician 2009 55 ere since arriving in ottawa i along with my fellow patricias have been presented with some

 former i d rather not be eaten alive by a shark major david marshall ottawa area ere patricia maj david

 corner of kabul that is forever england he was referring to the sherpur cantonment cemetery in kabul or as the 
 little blue and white plaque notes at the entrance the british cemetery a short distance from the canadian embassy and 
 about the size of a football field the cemetery was built in 1879 for those killed during second anglo afghan 
 war among the many graves is that of major john cook sth gurkha rifles who won a victoria cross as 
 a result of hand to hand fighting with pashtun tribesmen in december 1878 he was later killed during an attack 
 on the taht i shah peak one of several hills that surround kabul besides the many military graves the cemetery 
 also serves as a final resting place for those drawn to afghanistan for adventure exploration or simply to lend a 
 helping hand to the afghan people the most famous civilian grave is that of hungarian born british archaeologist aurel stein 
 who passed away in kabul in october 1943 in 2002 eva apor from the hungarian academy of sciences described stein 
 as one of the greatest personalities of the twentieth century who specialized in indian and iranian studies at 80 years 
 old he had come to afghanistan to study the military campaigns of alexander the great but cemetery plaque british cemetery 
 south wall passed away shortly after arriving today the cemetery is owned by the city of kabul and is not 
 part of the network of cemeteries recognised by the commonwealth war graves commission the result is that the british defence 
 attache office in afghanistan has become the cemetery s unofficial champion the british embassy also ensured that rahimullah the cemetery 
 s caretaker for at least thirty years was paid a small sum each month regrettably he passed away in early 
 march and now one of his sons has taken on the role for the new caretaker there are many graves 
 and numerous plaques to keep watch over indeed the granite plaques adorning the walls of the cemetery are of great 
 significance and on the eastern wall the names of 43 canadian soldiers are listed they lost their lives in and 
 around kabul between april 2002 and november 2006 17 were members of the ppcli 
 61 the patrician 2009 remembering the fallen canadian military history lives on in kabul like much of the cemetery the 
 300 metre eastern wall was in danger of tumbling down taking the canadian plaques with it however the british and 
 canadian embassy s each contributed 5000 to a special fund in february 2010 so that extensive repairs could be carried 
 out meanwhile the british embassy provided additional funding to ensure the southern wall where the names of all british war 
 dead are listed was also suitably repaired colonel overton while in winter the cemetery can look a little bleak it 
 is a different story in the spring and summer when the many trees and rose bushes are in full bloom

 the patrician 2009 62 association 95th annual general meeting report the anniversary was held the weekend of 8 10 may 
 2009 in edmonton at the ramada inn and conference centre although the number in attendance was under what was expected 
 those in attendance had a great time in attendance were members from as far away as st john s nfld 
 in the east to nagasaki japan in the west and mckenzie bc in the north the only province which was 
 not represented was quebec a couple of snowbirds who winter in brownsville texas even came back home to saskatchewan early 
 in order to attend the festivities when the event was initially planned the time frame chosen was the best time 
 to afford the serving members of the regiment an opportunity to attend but a change and alteration of the training 
 plan unfortunately prevented many from attending never the less there were a number of serving members in attendance including the 
 co and rsm of the third battalion and several members from the first battalion also in attendance besides the colonel 
 in chief and the colonel of the regiment were two previous colonels in chief there were representatives from all thirteen 
 branches of the association as well as members at large and former patricias and guests the piklee club chose their 
 annual affair to take place near the end of may and this affected the attendance greatly from that group i 
 guess they have more allegiance to their retired sgt s and warrant officers club than the regiment as their absence 
 was noticeable friday saw the usual meet and greet festivities take place as this was also the anniversary of the 
 battle of frezenberg a commemorative ceremony was held with the edmonton police pipes and drums band and a bugler from 
 the rca band participating in the afternoon about 100 or so young members of the third battalion joined the rank 
 and file for the meet and greet it was moving to see how people greeted others that they had not 
 seen in years and in some cases people they had not seen for at least 40 years the cmc and 
 cor present wo pete palmer with his regimental certificate of service after serving more than 20 years with the ppcli 
 there were a number of private exhibitors who brought in their collections of old uniforms web gear photos etc the 
 regimental kit shop was also in attendance and was almost completely bought out the troops from the third shook their 
 heads in disbelief at the sight of the web gear that we wore in the 50 s and 60 s 
 the annual general meeting saturday morning was attended by 70 people and was very productive the association welcomed a new 
 branch into the family with the new addition of the cyprus hills branch located in southern alberta now in the 
 fold all 13 branches of the association were represented during the weekend saturday evening at the dinner dance those in 
 attendance were treated to a great meal and music played by a local band that played music from the 50 
 s and 60 s era the music and food was thoroughly enjoyed by all during the dance a number of

 attended unfortunately the branch had to say goodbye 0:good 0:bye to two more members lan hunter and vern duerksen we 
 did not acquire any new members so our numbers are dropping and it is getting harder to get members out 
 to functions hopefully next year will see a turnaround of this situation bob mcdonald hard at work edmonton branch the 
 year 2009 as it always seems in the last decade was another busy and productive year the first half of 
 the year of course was taken up with preparations for the 95th anniversary of the regiment and the annual general

 who attended had a great time the battalions despite preparations for afghanistan etc participated as much as possible and their 
 presence was much appreciated we all took a well deserved rest after it was over locally the branch was very

 you would like to visit our area the fraser valley is very scenic and has many good golf courses giving 
 a helping hand december is generally a very busy month for the majority of canadian families preparing for the christmas 
 season on 20 december 2009 upon completion of my christmas shopping i decided to proceed back to home base and 
 check my computer for any new messages i received a message from our regimental major jeff bird asking for our 
 assistance on an rcmp request well as it turns out this was one week before christmas and the langley bc 
 rcmp had adopted a family who had suffered a great loss a few months earlier customarily they would gather food 
 hampers and such and deliver them to the family they had adopted for that year this year however the langley 
 rcmp were so moved by the accident that they responded to a 40 year old male who was crushed to 
 death in an industrial accident in september of 2009 that they adopted the albert family as their cause the 40 
 year old male was a father of three and was an ex patricia by the name of danny albert who 
 had served in the second battalion ppcli rcmp cpl michelle adrianne was detailed to coordinate and arrange a presentation on 
 the 23rd of december 2009 major jeff bird called upon the nearest available patricia in the area to lend a 
 hand if possible the rss person from vancouver was mwo bill armand and fraser valley president marc gagne the albert 
 family only wished we could attend this rcmp presentation as ex mcpl albert s wife wished to speak with members 
 from the ppcli regiment rcmp cpl michelle adrianne arranged to use the parade square on the old cfb chilliwack base 
 for the presentations they gave the young albert widow three bicycles for her children and one for herself along with 
 a young dog and stuffed toys and food hampers after all the speeches and further presentation from our chilliwack mayor 
 mrs albert walked over to bill armand and i and requested information on her husband s medals so that she 
 could have them mounted for her sons as we were not familiar with this ex servicemen we informed her of 
 the procedures we would follow we explained to her that we would have to contact the ppcli association for directions 
 on this type of request she asked if that is the ppcli family association and we explained our motto to 
 her once a patricia always a patricia upon returning home from the presentation ceremonies i immediately contacted major bird and 
 requested his assistance in this regard as a conscientious hard working individual major bird promised to check on this ex 
 servicemen s records to see what medals he had coming to him and if mounting 
 the patrician 2009 69 association could be done by the regiment he indicated that this would take some time and 
 that he would inform me and the albert family upon completion i informed the albert family of the regimental role 
 on this matter just a friendly reminder to all patricia s that we always aim to help all fellow patricia 
 s in whatever crises cypress hills branch it was a warm day at cfb suffield in early may 2009 when 
 the colonel in chief of princess patricia s canadian light infantry came to visit the troops during ex desert ram 
 this trip was not all about the soldiers in the field getting ready to deploy in the coming months it 
 was also to do something that had not been done for a number of years madam clarkson was here to 
 charter the newest branch of the ppcli association the cypress hills branch representing the patricias of south eastern alberta the 
 evening brought together serving patricias and families from the base as well as many of the retired members and families 
 residing in the area the evening began at the warrant officers and sergeants mess with an informal meet and greet 
 madam clarkson and the colonel of the regiment bgen l gollner ret d took the opportunity to mingle and meet 
 with those in attendance upon the completion of a very fine meal in the mess dinning room and after a 
 few drinks the charter was presented to the president of the branch mr dan palmer the colonel of the regiment 
 spoke about the importance of keeping alive the memory of the regiment and all that it has accomplished over close 
 to a century of service he also spoke of the key role the association plays in the safeguarding of that 
 memory the evening was a great success and it was the first time that a number of regimental family members 
 had the opportunity to meet the current colonel in chief and colonel of the regiment at present the branch boasts 
 a membership of nineteen serving and retired members as well as some spouses the cypress hills branch of the ppcli 
 association opens at cfb suffield 
 70 the patrician 2009 p 7 association southwest ontario branch greetings from the southwest ontario branch our annual general meeting 
 weekend was held at the days inn in st catharines the same location as last year and where it will 
 be held in 2010 meetings had a good turnout of members and guests as this is the one time of 
 the year that members from sw ontario can get together as a unit our executive remained the same for the 
 coming year on march 17th we held our ppcli 95th anniversary celebration dinner at betty s restaurant in niagara falls 
 with a very good membership turnout everyone had a good time and we plan to do it again at the 
 same location for 2010 most of the members in attendance are from the niagara peninsula in august we held a 
 bbq at bill chrysler s home in ridgeway there was a fair turnout due to the rainy weather but the 
 rain did not damper the spirits of those who attended and enjoyed lots of good food drinks and the periodic 
 sunshine our chief cook at the bbq was romeo daley who kept the burgers chicken and sausages coming we will 
 be planning a bigger and better one for the year coming john hunter and a few other members are still 
 working hard to put our proposed centennial project forward we need a support branch to assist us to keep it 
 moving forward john has done a lot of groundwork in hopes that this project would be accepted as it is 
 meant to continue beyond our centennial year various members are continuing to work with the communities in support of community 
 projects and forces identifications such as ed macdonald still working with the school on remembrance day projects as is hub 
 lalonde we have also joined forces periodically with the local rcr branch and put a proposal towards the city of 
 niagara falls to rename highway 420 into veterans memorial parkway this proposal is now in the final reading before regional 
 council and has a favourable sign of acceptance a number of us attended a dedication ceremony at the hamilton airport 
 to dedicate the rebuilding of a buffalo aircraft similar to the one that was shot down over syria with 9 
 canadian peacekeepers on board on the 9th of august 1974 family members of the 9 peacekeepers who died were in 
 attendance as the dedication was made by the lt governor of ontario our joining forces with the rcr branch is 
 done to promote recognition to the public of niagara peninsula on the existence of both units and to make former 
 members of those units become aware of our existence this has also promoted stronger comradeship between our two units courtesy 
 of the korea veterans association news photo which shows lance cpl william bill chrysler of hamilton now living in ridgeway 
 helping pte morris piche of ottawa in korea as bill recalls the moment we had just entered the front lines 
 it was the middle of february 1951 when we came under heavy fire as the enemy was withdrawing to slow 
 our advances morris was wounded and could not get out so i got him out of harms way to the 
 medics in closing we would like to extend an invitation to any patricia traveling in our area to join us

 give you an idea of what it might look like currently a cf 141 engineering request is working its way 
 through the system and will hopefully produce some design drawings and estimated costs if anyone out there has an opinion 
 please get a hold of the branch with your comments proposed changes to gault memorial park
