 s journey to the red deer river edited by hugh a dempsey by the late 1790 s the north west
 and hudson s bay companies had established trading posts right to the edge of the rocky mountains the fierce competition
 led them on to search for new lands and new tribes of indians with furs to trade in the spring
 of 1798 two kootenai indians visited fort edmonton and said that their land across the mountains abounded in furs of
 all kinds on the strength of this report the two companies built rocky mountain house and acton house at the
 confluence of the north saskatchewan and clearwater rivers in 1799 messages were sent to the kootenais and in october 1800
 david thompson in charge of the n w co s rocky mountain house learned that the first trading party was
 on its way across the rockies in order to bring the indians to his post rather than the opposition h
 b co s acton house and to guide them through the hostile peigans thompson set out to meet them the
 journal reproduced here covers thompson s trip and his negotiations with the kootenais it is published through the kind permission
 of the ontario archives which holds the originals throughout the text thompson s original spelling is retained and punctuation is
 added only where required for clarity any additions to the original text are contained in square brackets while the account
 published here is an isolated occurrence it is an important part of the westward movement of the fur trade the
 two men who returned west with the kootenais were probably the first white men to see the trans mountain country
 they returned to rocky mountain house in the spring of 1801 b ut a kootenai guide travelling with them was
 killed by a war party of stony indians as a result of the visits ai d discussions with the kootenai
 indians thompson realized that the fur trade must be carried across the mountains if it was to succeed accordingly in
 1807 he built kootenae house on lake windermere to serve the indians of the interior in his journal thompson entitles
 the following expedition as journey to the kootanaes rocky mountain october 1800 october 5 th sunday a fine cloudy several

 belonging selves on the pikenows and never forto them wanted to take him by force give them after we had
 gone about but the kootanaes bravely springing 7 or 8 miles the pikenows wanted to upon their arms h e
 was obliged to put up for the sake of draining from relinquish his prise but it raised a them every
 thing they had of worth small tumult in which a chief dis this i perceived was aware i had tinguished
 warrior of the pekinow went therefore previously given orders to the out made a speech suitable to the men in
 case the pikenows should wish occasion bidding the young men re to put up very early to pass on with
 member his example that when he the kootanaes they did so but no wanted horses he went took them sooner
 did the pikenows see them pass from their enemies bravely and that it than 3 young men took hold of
 the fore was an act neither brave nor manly most of the kootanae horses to make to rob a few
 strangers their allies of them turn round i rode up with the their poor starved horses they dis assistance of
 boulard made th em repersed but the kootanaes from such a linquish the horses get out of the prelude were
 many of them determined road this done i instantly went to to set off back for their country in the
 where our guide was about pitching night i went with boulard to them his tent told him to come on
 if he by entreaties encouraging conversa had any friendship for us and wished typical of the kootenays is this group

 which was readily horse they could by no means be per accepted by the latter they assembled suaded and seemed
 to consider what round our fire but the pikenows were ever had been stolen as lawful plunder by no means

 arrived from the head waters of the peace river last night he has resided in that country for th e
 past twentyfive years and considers that the reports regarding the fertility of the country speaking of that portion he has
 seen are false there is no farming land and although there have been numerous accounts about a large valley he
 says he has failed to find it the country is only good for fur hunting and the indians are suffering
 at the present time on account of the scarcity of game mr davis wishes any person intending to take up
 land to visit the river before bringing in his family the trees are useless for lumbering purposes and cattle must
 be fed during seven months of the year there will be found small stretches of land along the river bank
 with about an acre cleared on which the indians plant potatoes and other vegetables there are no whites in the
 country excepting two young men named brick sons of a missionary who is at present in the east raising money

 belt by h frank lawrence what i consider to have been my first contact with the great north west then
 undivided territory occurred in the autumn of 1881 when crossing from liverpool on the old moravian with my fellow passenger
 captain john french better known as jack french an officer of the north west mounted police his brother colonel french
 in its earliest days commanded that force captain french had been out on a year s furlough and no one
 on board that ancient allan liner contributed more to the enjoyment of everyone his north west experiences were always amusing
 and worth listening to our fellow passengers included ellen terry henry irving and a full company the voyage was all
 too short and in those early days a fifteen days passage was considered a creditable performance a month later i
 was travelling west however to return to th e journey with that hardy veteran of the northern sir donald had

 incidents were daily afdiscovered he had a big voice rail fairs in american travel way cars at that period were
 heated by stoves at either end and in any accident we arrived in chicago without the first thought and chief
 danger was further adventure in those days it was fire pinned down in our upper or lower the portal to
 the north west and the berths a few of us put in some anxious city still had traces of the
 great fire moments all the lights had fortunately i recall sir donald remarking first gone out and in spite of
 a very dark shanties never stand it is curious how night axes were rapidly brought into many a trifling remark

 exhibition the first exhibition of the edmonton agricultural society was held at edmonton house on the 15 th october richard
 hardisty esq of the hudson s bay company kindly offered the use of two rooms in the fort one of
 which was devoted to the vegetables and grain the oth er to ladies work the attendance was very large causing
 the fort to assume an unusually businesslike aspect the show of grain was unfortunately small and the quality not nearly
 as good as it ought to have been this was partly due to the rather late harvest but more particularly
 to the fact that only one or two farmers had threshed we h ave only two threshing machines in this
 neighbourhood and both are of small power and constantly out of repair the show of vegetables was splendid both as
 to quality and quantity most varieties were shown and the size of each kind was astonishing especially to those who
 had grown v egetables in other countries the ladies department was well represented and some beautiful work in silk wool
 worsted and leather was displayed the entries for h orses and oxen were not as large as might have been
 expected but doubtless we shall not have to complain of this another year few persons in this neighbourhood had ever
 seen nor did they understand the use or nature of an exhibition some say they did not exhibit because they
 knew their neighbor had better than they had others feared to invest a dollar for membership lest it might be
 thrown away but since the exhibition those who did not make an entry are sorry for it and nearly all
 are convinced that there is no better way to improve farm produce and show to the world the peculiar fertility
 of our soil than by supporting an agricultural society we confidently look forward to the next exhibition to prove yet
 further the capabilities of the upper saskatchewan country in comparison with that of prince albert little saskatchewan and places more
 easterly and in the meantime we hope some additional machinery will be brought into the country so that one and
 all may have their grain harvested and threshed at nearly the same time and not as at present when many
 will be unable to take their grain to th e mill until spring unless they thresh it with flails or
 horses saskatchewan herald nov 17 1879 19 the red river valley by edith fowke the song generally known as the
 red river valley is one of the most widespread of north american folk songs it has been sung as the
 bright mohawk valley the bright sherman valley the green little valley the dear little valley the cowboy s love song

 which is hard to explain in terms of a cowboy hero mr dempsey passed on this informaticn to a western
 journalist kenneth liddell who published an article in the calgary herald april 22 1960 suggesting that the song originated during
 the first riel uprising in manitoba in 1869 as a result of that article several personal recollections came to light
 a pioneer calgary lawyer j e a mac leod q c recalled that he heard the song in cape breton
 nova scotia before he left there in 1892 for the west and that it had been his understanding that it
 referred to a half breed girl and a militiaman senator gladstone of cardstan alberta also remembered hearing the song during
 his school days in pincher creek alberta in 1894 mrs jack bullough another calgary pioneer remembered having heard it at

 officials and others received a setback this morning when they endeavored to turn the well known trick of ejecting by
 brute force the man holding first place at the land office in the rush for a homestead thrown open for
 settlement this morning it was land situated near grassy lake that became open it was previously owned as a pre
 emption by william c llewelyn but he having recently sold his homestead by the regulations the pre emption automatically became
 vacant liewelyn however had the right to purchase a homestead and thus he was attempting to apply on this quarter
 this morning according to a land office official at half past eight there were only two or three men present
 llewelyn and one or two others who had been there since friday or saturday two or three minutes before nine
 o clock however a gang wh ich had operated at numerous other rushes drove up in a couple of automobiles
 and immediately made a set at llewelyn and forced him and his friends away taking possession of th e steps
 a number of spectators assembled and sided immediately with liewelyn with the result that a sort of donnybrook fair scene
 was enacted someone ran for the police and constable taylor arrived and later sergt lamb they stopped the fighting but
 there their powers ceased agent stafford who had witnessed the whole affair however came out and asked them to eject
 off the premises the whole crowd with the exception of young llewelyn which was done amid the cheers and applause

 narrower lane in 1909 the wainwright park was nothing happened ready and the buffalo from elk island were rounded up
 and shipped to their it was easy to get the brutes into the original destination stockyard but to load them
 onto the cattle cars was another matter many the late dr archer who took part had to be pulled in
