 when the time trouble with the northern indians government dealt with them for title to the was the last problem

 impossible title for a single payment in cash or land to notify the indians in time to meet the which
 usually was quickly dissipated be commissioners it was just as well the yond that the government had made no boundaries
 of the proposed treaty area had commitments not even been clearly delineated nor the the biggest problem was that the
 metis terms much discussed and the government clearly wished to be treated in this way not having decided what to
 do about the one of the justifications for government metis apparently hoped to ignore them delay prior to 1 885
 had been quite simply while proceeding with the treaty bishop the desire to find a solution acceptable to grouard of
 athabasca stressed to governthe metis which would produce a lasting ment officials the necessity of dealing with benefit for them
 but the metis insisted the half breeds simultaneously with the inon immediate and short term benefits the dians as otherwise

 of everyone a brief orgy of spending over the indians might be detrimental to by the metis and no important
 effects up our treating with the latter on their economic or social position the in june sifton recommended to the
 cabalternative was to take them into the trea met that the commission should proceed ties by virtue of their indian
 blood most in 1 899 and that it should be empowered however declined to take this course to deal with
 the metis as well as the indians whether because they considered them he also revealed that the two other imselves

 position to deal with the living half of 1898 it was proposed merely to attach breeds and not with the
 dead major janics walker of calgary and a clerk laird pointed out that such a proposal to the indian treaty

 treaty which the government cisely this situation that sifton had been had decided should be essentially the same trying to
 avoid settling with the metis of as the indian treaties of the 1 870 s but the district of athabasca
 clearly would rethey decided that the proposed terms for open the question in the rest of the ternthe metis were
 unsatisfactory these terms tories the territorial members of parliastill required the commissioners to deal ment particularly t 0 davis of
 saskatwith the half breeds and their children re chewan had been applying steady pressure sident in the territories prior to
 july 15 for a halfbreed scrip commission to 1 870 nearly 30 years before the heirs grant scrip to those
 born in the territories of those deceased could only share in the between i 870 and 1 885 so that
 the governscrip owing the deceased they could not nient could reap the political benefit one share in their own right
 such a policy thing is certain davis told sifton and would never satisfy the metis and they that is this
 if sic you do not appoint would use their influence with the indians that commission as promised there will to
 prevent the signing of the treaty the he no use in the goverment sic putting obvious and most simple solution
 would up a man in this riding and alberta sic be to deal with all metis born or resident and

 alleged ing in the north it had been decided that maladministration in the yukon and here no negotiations with the
 metis would be was another weapon with which to attack gin until the indian treaty had been signed him how
 could the government permit this was for two reasons first it was such a slap in the face from its
 officials designed to minimize pressure from indians they should have called the metis bluff wishing to decline the treaty in
 favour of sifton did concede that the commissioners being treated as metis and receiving in had really exceeded their instructions
 but stant cash indeed a problem cxisted be he continued cause apparently there were few indians it must be remembered
 that the financ who did not have at least some white blood ial benefit to the half breeds is not

 mctis for the treaty anxi ‘ zew in making this arrangement i say that is not the primaruj object it
 ous as they were for their own settlement is desirable that the provision which negotiations with the indians took only
 we make for this scrip being given to a few clays at stony point and by june the half breeds
 should be as great a benefit to the half breeds as possible 24 the half breed commission was begin that

 been of remoteness there was such a welldone to do familiar air about the scene and such a bustle of
