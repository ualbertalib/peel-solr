 indians had fifty pounds of flour and a few ounces of destroyed all the books at the post but tea
 they went off to the men s house to young was able to make a complete list cook this and
 after a while the chief came of the goods lost by referring to the invoices to me and said that

 i believe they were sent away at the same time 4 towards evening on the same day a beaver lake
 indian and one of big bear s indians came to big bay and told me they had come for the
 horses belonging to the company two of which i had sent there when i sent my family i said i
 would not give them to them but they replied they had been sent for them and would take 1 them
 the two horses were at the tent just beside us and they went and took hold of 1 one of
 them i took hold of the other and said you will not get this one then they said that i
 must go back to the fort with them and i went and reached the fort after dusk when i got
 there i found the place full of indians and among them ten of big bear s men the indians had
 built two large fires and they spent the night dancing and singing and firing off their guns all the buildings
 had been broken into the dooms and windows had been smashed and everything there was harrison s young was in
 charge of the fl the fort had been taken out and what hudson s bay co post which was looted
 by had not been carried away was lying scat indians in 1885 tered about everything that could be broken was
 broken and they had done all men were coniing that day to take the fort the danage they could to
 the buildings but that he and his men wanted to take short of burning or tearing them down the goods
 that were in the fort before the other indians came and hide them and 5 the next morning a report
 was startsave them for the company i did not know ed an tong the indians that the soldiers were what
 to do and before i said anything a coming from edmonton and they all start stoney indian who was there
 asked me to ed off from the fort the only thing they give him a little debt that is to

 to give him something and i un oxen at the fort waiting to be sent on to locked and went
 into the store to get what portage la loche fearing there was to he wanted then all the indians followed

 a little while said to me that i had was raided and as i have been informed better get out
 of the way before big bear s and believe some of the indians went to nen came for fear they
 might do some big bay and took three of the oxen from thing to me and as i was afraid
 they might the half breeds two of these were after i started off to big bay about 6 mi tiles
