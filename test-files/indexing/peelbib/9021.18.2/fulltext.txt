 michael phillipps with an introduction by lewis h thomas the following account of travep over the canadian pacific railway from
 golden b c to montreal is the first description of the line which was completed in 1885 by the joining
 of the westward section of the railway with the line built eastward from vancouver following the driving of the last
 spike by sir donald a smith at craigellachie on nov 7 th 1885 a correspondent of the free press winnipeg
 travelled from that city to new westminster later in the month and then returned to winnipeg he encountered no difficulties
 in reaching the coast and returning but when phillipps left golden for the east on dec 15 th the line
 west was blocked with snow and as we shall see the same conditions almost prevented him from reaching montreal the
 author of the account michael phillipps was born in hereford england in 1840 and emigrated to british columbia in 1864
 where he was employed by the hudson s bay company at fort shephard he left the service of the company
 in 1869 and located the well known phillipps ranch on tobacco plains in the kootenay country in 1887 phillipps was
 appointed indian agent for east and west kootenay holding this position until 1893 a strong and vigorous man experienced in
 all types of wilderness travel he had a keen interest in the resources of the mountain region and blazed the
 crow s nest trail which became the crow s nest pass route of one of the most important branches of
 the c p r he continued to live on the tobacco plains ranch until about 1906 when he sold out
 and moved to a nearby ranch on the bank of the elk river forty miles south of cranbrook here he
 died on july 22 nd 1916 ‘ fins document i reproduced through the courtesy of tile public archives of canada

 description of travel on the canadian pacific railway is a trenchant lively account by a man who possessed an excellent
 capacity for literary composition as an observer he expresses his views with candour and vigor replete with significant details the

 hills covered everywhere with luxuriant more severe out on the plains than it buffalo grass this is the charming bow
 was near the mountains as not only river valley we were fast leaving the was the river frozen but a
 few miles timber behind us there being now only from calgary we found ourselves in the a fringe along the
 edge of the river midst of snow running through a snow now and again we passed a homestead covered plain
 which stretched in every or farm but we saw no sign of snow al direction as far as the eye
 could reach though we were far into december this was my first night on the cars while we arrived at
 calgary about noon in motion and i did not sleep much and here the train stopped some little being unaccustomed
 to the motion and time enabling me to take a walk round rattle of the train the town probably it

 again about three there are double glasses to the windows o clock in the afternoon the rocky and a stove
 at each end of every car mountains passed i almost thought my but now the cold and the wind seemed
 self in england no more trouble now to come in everywhere in vain did the from snow car attendants and
 brakesmen poke and the weather which up to this time throw coal on the stoves it was imhad been most
 beautifully mild began possible to raise the temperature so to change and before night the ther cold was it that
 even when standing close to the stoves it was almost im into solitude level plain around and possible to keep
 warm and only one innumerable stars above but so teror two passengers at a time could get ribly cold looking
 some time during near each stove the stoves appear to the night we passed regina the new have been too
 boxed up to give out capital of the north west where the much heat but probably this has been lieutenant

 upsetting a little be quarters of the mounted police fore daylight the engine was uncoupled when morning came we were
 still and went forward for water leaving the steaming away across the level snowtrain standing on the track for hours
 covered plain there are engine tanks with a sort of about mid day we arrived at bran windmill arrangement for
 raising the don all along the railway there are water at intervals along the line in nice farms and houses
 though the abcrossing the plains and small and sence of timber gives them a bare and solitary landmarks they seemed
 in the rather comfortless appearance at this wide expanse of prairie time of year on the open plains the wind
 had from brandon all the way to winswept the snow from the track and we nipeg there are farms and
 signs of steamed ahead all day cit a fine pace settlement passengers getting in and the cold seemed less formidable
 by day out at numerous small stations at which light as the passengers kept moving we stopped about and crowding
 round the stoves a young englishman who resides at a little after six in the evening we near brandon to
 whom i was talking arrived at moose jaw the conductor complained of the summer frosts which had telegraphed forward stating
 how much damaged the wheat crops last many passengers were in the train and summer we found a really good
 dinner ready about six in the evening we began for us at the railway company s hotel to pass engine
 sheds and buildings we remained at moose jaw about half which showed we were coming to a an hour by
 the lights there appeared town of some size in a few minutes we to be quite a little town on
 our return drew up along side of a long platform to the platform we found fresh cars which like all
 others i had seen on the another engine a new conductor etc canadian pacific was quite uncovered the cars are
 simply superb the the conductor walked down the cars crimson velvet cushions the gilding and in a quiet but distinct
 voice rechandeliers and gorgeous fittings corn peated winnipeg all change here pare strangely with the dingy and con again to
 our disgust we were turned fined compartments of an english rail out into the cold the next train for the

 that are found i had already ascertained the name in the cabin of an atlantic steamer west of the hotel
 i intended going to from of winnipeg during the present winter some people who had joined the train there are
 no emigrant or cheap rates at brandon so as soon as i had got and only the saloon cars clear
 of the hotel boys i went with a the conductor called us all aboard number of my fellow passengers to

 nights on cold and wintry in the extreme the cars i had not quite got used to the train from
 the east was several the rattle and grinding which is cer days behind time the telegraph operatainly more fatiguing than
 the motion tors could get replies only from white on board ship river about 100 miles ahead beyond winnipeg is
 a well laid out town that place the storm had evidently with some very fine new stone buildings thrown down
 the telegraph wires and is lighted by electricity so the where the atlantic train was no one hotel clerk told
 me and i was quite knew the only answer we could get content to take his word for it the
 to our inquiries was ‘ don t know thermometer was 40 degrees below zero the country along the northern and
 the wind still blowing strange as shore of lake superior is rough and it may seem i had no wish
 whatever rocky without grandeur and not even to go out into the cold for the purpose picturesque if we except
 a few views cf looking at winnipeg of the lake itself here the engineers of i spent the following day
 the 23 rd the company had one of their hardest indoors the wind was sweeping down pieces of work indeed
 this portion of the wide streets and rendered anything the railway has been open only for a like a walk
 for pleasure impossible few months passengers to winnipeg i went down to the railway depot previously going either by the
 united in good time and took a through ticket states lines or in the summer by to montreal from winnipeg
 to the at steamboat on the lakes to port arthur lantic there are several opposition lines and thence by the
 canadian pacific going south through the united states railway to winnipeg and the rates are cheap indeed corn passengers who
 had been over the pared with those west of winnipeg new portion of the line told me that the road
 bed was as yet very rough i decided to continue on by the can and that we should have a
 good shakadicin pacific as not only more direct ing they also gave it as their opinion than going south via
 st paul minn and that the line was blocked with snow the u s side but also because there no
 one however anticipated any seriwas no change of car all the way to ous trouble montreal the usual time from
 winnipeg there seemed to be quite a number to montreal is under favourable cir of shops in port arthur if
 i had had cumstances four days and nights any idea of what was ahead of us i what kind of
 a country we passed should have inspected those shops with through during the night i do not know greater interest
 and have laid in a daylight brought to our view a country stock of comforts for the inner man differing
 entirely from the plains through a little after 1 p m on the 24 th decwhich we had been travelling
 ember we steamed out with a couple we were now in a rough broken of engines to draw us and
 went at a woody country the timber was small fair speed until shortly after dark when and for a long
 distance burnt by forest we came to a standstill at some place fires and the hills nowhere rising to there
 was a siding with a few cars on the dignity of even low mountains the it which were being used
 as houses snow was getting much deeper as we by men working on the railway huge proceeded at eleven o
 clock we arrived at fort ‘ winiiipcg had experienced a dramatic speculative william once a hudson s bay trading boom
 in 1882 and 1883 but bad now settled down station now a town and about half to a period of
 slower but more soundly based rosvthi an hours afterwards we reached port ‘ 1 l hev had now reached the
 great precambrian arthur thunder bay on lake superior shiiehh country which extends through much of thin where we stayed for
 about an hour area towards ottawa 7 icicles hanging from the cars and deep cars at white river and who
 comsnow all around presented anything pletely filled up the cars but a cheerful aspect as we poked our in less
 than half an hour we came noses out into the cold to try and find to another stand in a
 cut which was out why we were stopping all we nearly filled up with snow out poured could find out
 was that there was no the norwegians with their wooden answer from the east to telegrams the shovels but they
 were soon in again wires have come to grief and that as their shoe packs and leggings covered there is
 only a single line of rail we with snow and their beards a solid must stay where we were until
 we re mass of ice after they had thawed themceived information of the whereabouts selves a little they turned out
 again of the atlantic train when i got up the and recommenced shovelling away the next morning we were still
 standing snow still another tiresome day and the only after considerable delay we sucanswer we could ‘ obtain to any
 inquiry ceeded in making our way through the as to when we were likely to start was first cut only
 to get into another a little don t know white river i found further on night came and found us
 in out is the name of this delightful place a drift with a light wind blowing which where we spent
 our merry christ drifted the snow and filled up the track as fast as it was cleared our friends there
 were apparently only six or the norwegians had frequently to come seven real passengers on board though in to warm
 themselves but as frequently there were also a good many who had did they gallantly return to the charge passes
 who had i suppose been em each time they came into the cars they ployed on the railway during the
 sum preceptibly chilled down the atmosmer of the passengers nearly all were phere going either to ottawa or montreal all
 through the night we could hear only one besides myself being bound the short whistles of the two locomotives through
 to england as the drivers signalled to one another early on the second morning a mes that they might put
 forth their sage came from winnipeg directing us strength at exactly the same moment to proceed ahead slowly during the
 day the sound brought back to my mind the light the direction to go ahead slowly savoured of mockery it
 was nearly noon ‘ vliite river today prides itself in being thin coldest before the locomotives were ready to to
 vn in canada start and when our two engines did steam off with all steam on they moved us along
 but at a sorry pace we took winter storms posed a serious threat to rail travellers as the author discovered
 during his with us a large force of norwegian eastward trek in 1885 the view below is typical navvies who
 lived in the stationary of the conditions facing railroads at that time dear old home of my boyhood where agent
 that is a good deal of heat on i had so often lain awake listening to his part and perfect
 good temper on the hooting of the owls in the big elm mine i gained my point that nothing which
 overshadows what was once my but the letter mail should go forward bedroom window and that the dog sleighs should
 carry daylight found the engine drivers our wrappers and necessary luggage in vainly endeavouring to back out of a place
 of the paper and parcel post bank of snow as by this time they had early on sunday morning january
 quite satisfied themselves that they 3 rd we wished those passengers who could not go forward after many in preferred
 remaining with the train effectual attempts they decided upon good bye and started off our party reserving their coal and
 water as it consisted of the mail agent three paswas now clear that all attempts to ex sengers including myself
 one braketricate the train before the wind went man and also narcisse and two other down were useless the snow
 drifting hudson s bay voyageurs the conductor into the cut almost as fast as the men of course remained with
 the passengers shovelled it out and the men could not in the train how long it was before they work
 much until the weather moder were dug ‘ out i do not know up to the ated soon after breakfast
 the nor time i left montreal they had not arwegians started back for white river rived although the line was
 reported leaving us to our fate they had no clear and open between winnipeg and snowshoes although the snow was
 montreal drifted and packed hard with the wind the first day we made only about occasionally the foot would break
 seven miles the travelling even behind through which made walking without the dog sleighs being a little fatiguing snowshoes very
 fatiguing for those who had no snowshoes our stock of provisions in the dining at night we camped out we
 found car was by no means a large one but a number of empty cabins and shanties we calculated that
 within three days we by the side of the railroad as we jourshould receive assistance or at all neyed along
 which had been used durevents a fresh stock of provisions more ing the construction of the line we did than
 twice that time elapsed however not however go far enough the first without our seeing anyone the con day to
 reach one of these as some of ductor could not leave the train with the party were unused to snow
 travelout orders and no one seemed to know ling and were completely tired out i exactly what to do preferred
 camping in the open myself i had promised to be in england soon as it was generally more convenient for
 after new year s day christmas had firewood than round the deserted cabins passed and the new year had come
 the second day we made a long disbut england appeared to be further off tance the snow excepting in the
 cuts than ever being little more than a foot deep as at the end of the week two dog an
 old snow shoe walker i took my sleighs with voyageurs arrived from turn in advance breaking track port arthur a
 relief train had brought we camped at night at a section them to within a few miles of where house
 belonging to the company the we were snowed up the conductor also section men had not turned out since received
 orders to feed the passengers the storm but proposed doing so on the free but as nearly everything was al
 following day the wind had died away ready eaten up none of us felt much and it was decidedly warmer
 than it comforted at the strange liberality of had been for the two previous weeks the railway company the men
 did not know where the break as the dog sleighs were going on at in the wires was or how
 far we should once with the mail i and two of my have to go before we should be picked
 fellow passengers determined to accom up pany them how far we should have to on thursday the 7 th we
 fell in walk none of us at all knew after a with a party of men from the east lookrather
 hot discussion with the mail ing for the break in the telegraph wires 9 before the c p r had
 been completed rail service was being provided along its line here engine 147 is seen at calgary station in 1884
 we with true human selfishness had in charge did not seem to be in an been picking our foot steps
 with eyes express hurry and kindly stopped to cast down without a thought of any but have a talk about
 the weather and ourselves and had forgotten all about supplied us moreover with a small the telegraph poles alongside of
 us and stock of provisions notwithstanding our could not give them any information news as there was a working party
 they looked cheerful at this and at us on board they determined to proceed and at the pleasing prospect of
 the long and assist in getting out the snowtrudge before them plough and in clearing the track it seems to
 me that although the early on saturday the 9 th of jan company could not help the storm and uary
 we arrived at a small station i the trains getting blocked they might think callander by name and here by
 a little better management have ended our walk through the snow of saved their servants much labour and 104 miles
 which had taken us seven and the passengers no little discomfort days to accomplish after some little they should i
 think have been better delay and telegraphing an engine and prepared for so likely an event in such car were
 dispatched to our rescue and a region as a snow storm we were carried on to chapleau here on friday
 we came across a snow we found a regular passenger train plough with a couple of engines in the and
 proceeded on our journey and arsnow and off the track a strong force rived without further delay we passed of
 men were endeavouring to get them ottawa in the afternoon and arrived back on to the rails late at night
 at montreal the same evening we met the atlantic express which had been the during the winter months owing to
 cause of so much uneasiness to the of the freezing up of the st lawrence the ficials we had left
 behind us those vessels of the canadian steamship lines 10 sail from portland me calling at hali oregon which however
 did not sail fax for the mails etc i found that there until nearly four in the afternoon on would
 be no boat leaving portland until the 15 th late at night we reached the following thursday january 14 th
 halifax nova scotia and stayed until waiting even a few days in a noon on the following day waiting for
 strange city where you know no one the last canadian mail and twelve days is always tedious and at six
 on tuesday later we arrived at liverpool evening i gladly left by the grand let those who have crossed the
 sea trunk railway for portland we travel in rough weather during the cold sealed all night and arrived at breakfast

 dominion steamship canadian pacific railway ra il wa y to ma leod jas mowat arrived from the c e works
 south of calgary last week when he left the rails were laid to pine creek and the grading was finished
 to mosquito creek and the graders were strung out nearly to maclead which place it is expected the railway will
 pass at a distance of about ten miles on its way to the crowsnest pass leaving calgary the railway follows
 the old macleod trail closely across fish and pine creeks from pine creek it diverges to the west of the
 trail by way of the wilson coulee through which it reaches sheep creek a short distance above lineham s sawmill
 crossing the creek it follows down the valley and around the point of high land which divides the valley of
 sheep creek from that of high river then up the valley of high river to the ferry where it crosses
 the river and follows the trail to mosquito creek which it crosses a mile east of the trail from mosquito
 creek it bears still further eastward and passes about seven miles east of the leaving of willow creek on the
 macleod trail near macleod its course has not yet been determined it is expected that grading will be completed to
 the gap of the crowsnest pass this fall the country through which the road runs is much more rolling than
 along the line north of calgary and there is more cutting and bridging but the dirt is easier to handle
 being more dry and sandy than the wet black muck of the north consequently although the road costs the contractors
 more the graders are making better pay the health of the men is good but there is some of the
 same fever amongst the imported horses that killed so many last fall keith and mackenzie have already lost 16 horses
 and have as many more laid off work through sickness the country along the line from calgary to high river
 is well settled by ontario farmers and the good farm buildings schools and churches are very noticeable a large acreage
 is under crop but a terrible hail storm in august destroyed ninetenths of it and will necessarily cause some hardship
 amongst the settlers the storm worked a great change in the opinions of the settlers regarding edmonton before it occurred
 the edmonton men employed on the road dare not mention this place or they would be jumped on from all
 sides but since the storm edmonton stock has been booming and many of the settlers looking at their bare fields
 think longingly of the full fields and big grain stacks of the edmonton district edmonton bulletin sept 26 1891 11
 mountain place names and the lake louise club by james gardner early in 1894 a group of yale undergraduates and
 recent graduates formed the lake louise club to explore survey and map as much of the lake louise area as
 possible the region consisted of the area immediately around the lake the valley of the ten peaks paradise valley and
 the intervening mountain groups peripheral to the group s activities in the area was the exploration of the lake o
 hara region by s e s allen one of the members of the group despite the seemingly close knit allen
 had a zeal for languages and nature of the club a surprising number learned words from the stony indians of
 incongruencies arose in the names who accompanied him on many of his they applied to the various features in trips
 in the rockies from this interest the area the place names of today are came the romantic and fitting names
 of a mosaic from efforts of club individuals some of the features in the lake louise and other sources notably

 resemblance did not contribute greatly to the explorato the bishop s hat the name survives tion or the nomenclature of
 the area today while camped in paradise valley when allen and wilcox set out for the club knew the existence
 of a large mount temple in 1893 they passed the valley to the south in 1893 allen and entrance to
 paradise valley although wilcox had entered the valley from the they did not enter it and didn t know bow

 known of its existence in ad at a small lake at the base of the east dition they had climbed
 to the saddle ridge of mount temple allen called and must have seen the lower half of this ice lake
 it had some floating ice paradise valley however the official on it but wilcox did not refer to it discovery
 of the valley had to wait until by name in any of his manuscripts or 1894 when the club reached
 the east maps today ice lake lies forgotten and mitre pass from the lake louise side unnamed the view into
 the valley was impressive in 1893 allen and wilcox skirted and allen stated the southeastern base of mount temple on
 the top of the large late wisconsin cia we stepped upon the narrow ridge 9 000 feet above the sea
 the view lateral moraine and must have seen beyond was indeed beautiful which by moraine lake at this time in

 the south and west side tence of cathedral crags near field the names for indian numerals from one wilcox s
 name pinnacle has been adop to ten heejee 1 to wenkchemna 10 ted but cathedral became eiffel for its wilcox
 and henderson saw fit to change resemblance to the eiffel tower the name of the valley to desolation valley a
 name that has not been adop when allen and henderson made ted about the only peaks still referred the first

 company early in 1920 j palmer and i carried hundreds of passengers safely quickly and comfortably the first plane we
 had was a jn curtiss 90 horsepower 0 x 5 engine a type known in wartime as the canadian training
 ship during these years we never had a single known instance where a passenger has not left our machine as
 an enthusiastic booster for aviation two of our lady passengers in particular stated it was a decided pleasure to have
 flown the first lady to fly in our plane everything in general the best part of was mrs e mckenzie
 the wife of a it was she had evidently given much local businessman while the plane was thought and study
 to the subject as we being set up and rigged for its first flight found out by listening to her
 explanashe used to come and watch the pro lions to her friends that she was pretty gress of it and
 enquire when it would well posted be ready finally the day came after another lady mrs mclaughlin testing out the
 machine on its first flight whom we were delighted to carry was and she went up she was one of
 our the wife of a prominent automobile best boosters after that and continually manufacturer in eastern canada she came out
 to the drome in her car with and her husband were out here on a spectators and passengers her interest
 trip with a party of eastern business in the plane never seemed to abate and people and one of their

 were the still sleeping town several times over her house daily she had never and finally landed in a field
 about a thought of flying herself until the 0 p mile out for gas and breakfast the noise portunity happened
 to present itself this of the engine had apparently awakened night she stated that from now on she the town
 and from the time we landed would fly every opportunity she got the road became a constant stream of traffic
 bare footed boys running men on one of our first flights away from on horseback automobiles women push the home
 aerodrome we went to raymond where we ran into a terrific wind ing baby carriages and in fact every form
 of conveyance was utilized to get storm which we fought for two days in out to see the first airplane
 that ever an open field outside of the town at landed at warner we arranged with times the wind had
 a velocity of eighty a couple of men to guard the plane miles an hour and as every dollar while
 we went to the hotel for a much palmer and i had in the world was needed breakfast and wash
 after gettied up in our machine also the money ting gas and oil we took off upon our of many
 of our acquaintances and flight to sweet grass montana much friends you can imagine our anxiety relieved to have successfully
 defeated at one time we had seven wire cables a typical southern alberta breeze which from a fence over the
 engine and fuse tried so hard to destroy our plane lage and tied to stakes in the ground the wheels
 and wings being secured this was our first experience with as well during a temporary lull of the these gales
 as neither of us had flown wind i ran to a farm house nearby to in canada before acquiring our
 masecure more stakes and when about one chine all our flying had been done in hundred yards away from the
 machine england and france where the air is on my return i observed palmer lying altogether different and the altitude
 on on his face on one of the wings trying the ground is almost sea level in this frantically to
 maintain himself and the country we are 3 000 feet above sea plane on the ground old maud was level
 and this makes considerable diftrying her hardest to fly without engine ference in the efficiency of a plane and in
 the actual flying of it power and if our stakes had given out our enterprise would have died in in
 for the benefit of the people who fancy as it was she was off the ground figure out the heights
 that different fully a foot at every gust and my part species of birds fly at we have often ner
 was all in as quickly as possible met lone sparrows at 2 000 feet and drove in fresh stakes and
 we eventually other birds much higher a sparrow was got the plane more secure we slept responsible for a forced
 landing on our with the machine for two nights and second trip to raymond as the machine only relieved each
 other during the was taking off and about twenty feet days to go for food from the ground the bird
 flew directly into the propeller and shattered it caus this was a valuable lesson to us ing the machine to
 make a landing in and at all future times when we had a wheat field the wheat was so long
 occasion to leave the plane in fields that it wrapped around the axle thus overnight we took advantage of all
 pos preventing her from running on the sible shelter dips in the ground straw ground and she turned over on
 her nose stacks shrubbery or anything that as we could not get her out of the would serve as a
 wind break many field again we dismantled the wings times we had to sleep in fields where and towed her
 into lethbridge i have stock was to keep them from rubbing the remains of the propeller yet and 19 showed
 it at the fair at lethbridge where being disappointed at losing palmer we had a picture exhibit we have no
 the bull returned to the plane and atrecord of what happened to the bird temped to wreak his vengeance on
 it he did succeed in ruining one elevator five minutes after we had left leth and then departed to the
 far end of bridge on the flight the police were en the field we made temporary repairs deavoring to locate
 us to go up the and flew to lethbridge where we put crownest pass in pursuit of bassoff and on
 a new elevator his gang of train robbers who had held needless to say we have never reup a train
 that afternoon at sentinel turned to raymond as after surviving near the british columbia line some a terrible wind storm
 an argument with days after this in a gun fight at belle a sparrow and playing matador to a vue
 two policemen and one bandit were crazy bull we felt that is was not wise killed and bassoff was eventually

 of accidentally not stunting was the our adventures also occurred at ray originator in the united states of the mond
 in 1920 the machine was sitting feats of wing walking changing planes in the field in the centre of the
 race in mid air and other aerobatics on the track almost opposite the grand stand wings of a plane in

 attraction on at that time was ever did these feats successfully we steer riding and bull dogging one of have

 instead of going into training for them i have never given the corral at the end of the track he

 these feats were used sucmediately lowered his head and chose cessfully in life saving by different airme to pace him
 for a marathon around men once when part of the wing was and around the plane we went the rest
 shot off an observer climbed out on the of the party joining in i was afraid opposite wing and succeeded
 in keepthat the animal might try to take a short ing the plane in balance until he and his cut
 and jump over or through the plane partner were able to get down on the which would have wrecked it
 complete ground they broke the plane of course ly i shouted to the others to run for the but saved
 their lives at another time fence and started for there myself and a machine was on fire and both pilot
 finally got up onto the top rail of the and observer climbed out on a wing corral and paused for
 breath and landed safely at another time in on looking around i observed my the early days of war flying
 an observer partner palmer taking long leaps to got out on the plane with a rifle and ward me and
 the bull after him palmer shot down a hun machine which could had his flying helmet on the chin strap
 not be reached with his gun owing to was undone the helmet was flapping the hun being on the blind
 side of the on both sides of his ears and he re plane and consequently out of sight sembled nothing
 else than a holstein palmer and i used to have many fleeing from her irate husband he was discussions on
 these feats and when i straining every nerve to reach the fence was in california shortly after i returned first
 and finally did so by a small from overseas i saw locklear performmargin on scrambling up beside me he ing
 some of his feats and it struck me gasped out how is that for speed that in days to come
 there would be did i run him to death the crowd in such a thing as a service airplane which
 the grandstand rooted and cheered and would supply oil and gas to machines many of our acquaintances stated it was
 which did not wish to stop and lose time the best thing on the programme they would be in the
 vicinity of their 20 author fitzsimmons is seen here with a passenger at manyberries in 1920 own airdromes and upon
 signal a hose allow me to drop in the lake and would be dropped the necessary gas chances were that
 i would come out and oil pumped in the money sent unharmed that was the plan if we had down
 mail transferred and exchanged to use it which we never did as i have and so on and why not
 always been something of an athelete the reason i started these wing the balancing and climbing came quite walking feats
 was that in 1920 we were easily to me late getting in the field and i found we always carried
 out our performmost of my competitors were bidding ance at sufficient height that in the for fair contracts as a
 newcomer i had event of trouble due to engine failure to devise a scheme to beat them to it i
 would have plenty of time to come in in order to keep my company in opera and the machine could
 be got under tion palmer and i then started to train complete control on only two occasions quietly one of
 our favorite places was did i ever have to come in quickly over henderson lake when few people once from
 the top plane owing to a were around we practised the top and broken spark plug and once from the
 bottom plane work first and devised a extreme end of the bottom wing on acset of signals as we were
 both practical count of magneto trouble there was no airmen we knew the effect of strain danger to either of
 us for we had made and balance on the wings and how to proper provision for these occurrences work together
 after i disappeared from by having plenty of height sight underneath the plane palmer was i received much criticism for
 these to give me one minute and a half and feats but as they continued to bring if at the
 end of that time i did not re fair contracts many from the territory appear he would figure that i
 was ex where our competitors were working hausted or otherwise unable to get back we did not worry about what
 other up he was then to come down as close people thought i don t mind admitting to the lake
 as possible then pull the that when we first introduced these machine almost up to a stall this would stunts
 the canadian air board had no 21 employment prospects such as fire ness as we were passenger flying and patrols
 over the mountains then and if stunting exhibitions everyone in times had been normal our company canada has heard of
 his wonderful war would have had more legitimate sources record of forty five hun planes and of of revenue but
 when we had only the his many decorations for his fighting fairs and public gatherings for revenue ability we had
 to carry on with our stunting all the airmen present sat around exhibitions until they had served their in his
 hangar and had a regular oldpurpose and we voluntarily discontinued time visit and many war experiences them during that time
 two people were were re told among which was one i killed in western canada endeavoring told of a certain
 bomb raid in france to imitate our feats but such efforts in 1918 in which i was one of the
 parshould not have been permitted except ticipants the story is as follows by practical airmen who had taken on many
 of our air raids we would every precaution and training before receive orders to pick up a scout escort ever
 going before the public to attempt over a spot called aveluy wood the them planes we were using at the
 time were the first place we gave one of our re eights and loaded down with six exhibitions was at
 conrad montana twenty pound copper bombs two wireand from there practically all over al less sets two machine guns ammuniberta
 in june 1920 i received a wire tion message bags pistols and cartfrom locklear asking us to rent him our
 ridges etc not to mention a pilot and plane for his calgary and edmonton observer consequently these planes engagements this
 i agreed to do but were fairly well loaded and would stagshortly after contracts came in very fast ger along
 over the lines at a height of and when locklear s manager came to from twenty five hundred to seven
 thouinterview us about the plane we were sand feet at a speed of only sixty five appearing at an exhibition
 some dist to seventy miles an hour consequently ance away he got on the train came we needed the fast
 little scouts as esand saw our show then we asked to corts to keep the hun machines away be excused
 of our contract and he we had been detailed to pick up a agreed he then offered a contract on
 certain squadron day after day flying behalf of palmer and myself and an the se 5 plane and when these
 speedy other aviator north of us to go to eng little single seaters sat over us at thirland to do
 the change of plane act teen thousand feet it always gave us again a few weeks after locklear s great
 confidence on this occasion we death i had the chance to go to cali made our objective dropped our pills
 fornia and finish an uncompleted pic and when returning towards our lines lure we turned both of these offers we
 were attacked by a bunch of heinies down which would have made us much our escorts were nowhere in sight
 when money for i believed that by sticking the scrap started but in a few moments to commercial aviation in
 this country our friends dove down out of the clouds we would come out on top where they had been
 hiding the in the summer of 1920 my partner heinies were taken completely by surand i contracted to distribute certain
 prise and a lively little dog fight enadvertising literature over the cities of sued planes darting across in front calgary
 and edmonton during their ex turning diving zooming and in the hibitions we made the flight to cal general mele
 it was hard to tell friend gary and fulfilled that part of our con from foe then a heinie flying
 a weirdtract locklear was appearing there and colored plane pulled out of the scrap at edmonton and one of his
 pilots and figured out a little offensive of his agreed to drop our literature over own he would dive straight
 into the edmonton for us centre of things firing like the mischief after we landed and housed our go right
 on through and come around machine on capt fred mccall s air again he had pulled this little trick off
 drome at calgary we stayed overnight twice when i observed one of our scouts mccall was engaged in the same
 busi break off the fight go around from the 22 opposite side follow the hun on through wrench this broke
 off two of the underand put burst after burst into him and carriage struts driving them through the sending him
 down on fire the fight then bottom pan under the engine the metal took on a different angle and in
 a few fittings were broken off completely and minutes our escort literally mopped before we could leave they had to
 be them up and sent every one of the repaired germans out ‘ of the sky i made arrangements with
 the local i had told this story to the fellows blacksmith who told me he had repaired sitting around and
 noticed mccall get everything in his life except an airplane ting greatly excited upon the conclu and now he had
 a chance to try his sion of it he filled in a number of hand on one of those we
 made two new details described our machines the struts out of two by fours and also the number of huns
 and types of their ma necessary fittings which were very chine the place where the fight started heavy and crude
 but answered the purand proved conclusively that he was pose when we got the plane fixed up present at the
 scrap mccall was the she looked like a race horse with rubber squadron leader of our escort and the boots
 on but we got away finally and fellow who had shot down the odd flew home to lethbridge there we
 took colored hun so here we met for the the temporary repairs off and put on a first time on
 his airdrome in calgary complete new undercarriage which both engaged in civil aviation far from made the plane look more
 human but the ambitious huns we had a great had any of our flying friends seen us visit and some
 time later both our planes coming home they would have had were wheeled out mccall departed for quite a laugh
 at the appearance of the a town some hundreds of miles away old bus where he was due for a
 stunting ex on another occasion we were about hibition while i galloped off for mon a hundred miles away giving
 a flying tana upon the same errand july 5 th exhibition and were forced to stay over 1920 almost two
 years from the time of night we tied the machine down and that memorable little scrap tried to secure a
 room at the hotel but break downs or crashes are not al all were occupied we eventually got ways serious
 and at times are quite one at a chinese rooming house and humorous they are often caused by examined the
 bed which was far from operating on rough fields which prevent inviting owing to the shortage of linen perfect landings
 no matter how great the skill of the pilot while flying at new dayton the machine made a per holidayers
 from a c p r employees picnic fect landing but went through a large are clustered near the lethbridge exhibition
 cattle wallow which gave it a terrific building waiting for a ride in the airplane this view was taken from
 the aircraft in 1921 we went downstairs and complained to look at it from various angles and dist the man
 in charge who appeared very ances and again recite some talk to apwrathy he informed us that over one parently
 someone in the sky in a few hundred men had slept in that bed and minutes a car came out
 of the townwe were the first to complain of the site and mr haug and some others were condition of
 the sheets after we in it and wished us to come with them passed a few remarks with the son
 of to dinner i explained and pointed out confucius and went back to the plane the antics of the indian
 lady and asked we found about twenty cows trying to haug if she was bereft or just excited use the
 rudder and the corners of the he said that s mrs kootenai brown wings as a scratching post we chased
 and went up to the woman and spoke to them away and slept on the ground her in indian i
 presume under one of the wings after a short conversation he came in the morning we examined the back and
 said that he was an old friend plane and found that the rudder was of both mr brown and herself
 and that punctured in several places by the horns she said kootenai brown was the of the cattle as we
 were without the wisest man that ever lived and never necessary dope patches etc to repair spoke with crooked tongue
 that years the damage we had to call on our in before the war he had told her that genuity
 we purchased a needle linen she would live to see men flying in a thread and a supply of adhesive
 stick machine around and over her home like ing plaster and with these we made birds she said there is
 the proof how temporary repairs to the rudder which could he have foretold this unless he enabled us to get
 home needless to say was wise we kept a close eye on our first aid we did a tremendous business
 all patches but they were as strong when day until late in the evening at 10 a we landed at
 lethbridge as when we flight and the old lady was our most put them on interested spectator sitting on a
 knoll on july 1 st 1920 at the earnest near the main road and coming over to solicitation of ernie
 haug of waterton the plane after each flight walk around lakes palmer and i flew our curtiss it give it
 a gentle pat here and there plane to waterton park and complied and then resume her seat by the road
 with mr haug s invitation after circl and she remained until we left late in ing around trying to locate
 a reason the evening ably clear and level spot we finally i was taken with her actions and located one
 about three and a half interested in her remarks about mr miles from the townsite and palmer brown of whom
 i had heard so much landed the machine but never met apparently to her we had just got out of
 the plane kootenai was a god or superman as and in open cockpits and mountain fly he had told her
 of many things such ing we wore helmet goggles and as the auto the binder tractor etc and heavy leather
 coats before we had an they had all appeared in due time opportunity to divest ourselves of this on this
 flight i had my flying helmet clothing we heard a shriek of wild which i had worn in france during
 the laughter and saw a disheveled indian war it was valuable to me for a bullet woman running towards us
 she ran hole from a hun machine gun had left round and round the plane pointing to a path through
 the centre of it if it had it and to us then raising her face to been an inch lower
 it would have serithe sky and with arms aloft gave quite ously interfered and quite possibly dea speech in what
 i took to be the indian layed the formation of the lethbridge language aircraft co however i foolishly loaned i
 went up to the woman and spoke this helmet to some of our passengers to her as i thought she
 was wildly ex whom the other helmet would not fit cited i led her up to the machine and one
 passenger noticed the holes and she patted and poked palmer and my enquired the reason my partner palmer self all
 over our leather jackets and then told the story of the helmet it would then run over and pat the
 plane was passed around and examined with 24 much interest later on when i went goggles and coats were just
 one sticky to locate it the helmet had disappeared pulpy mass and the old plane had a now airmen are
 as a rule super dejected droop owing to the flat tire stitious about the loss of any personal we found
 out that the village was flying clothing this was true of my hel glenwoodville fifty miles from lethmet and when
 we decided that some bridge it was a veritable no man s land one had stolen it i told palmer
 to watch not even telephone communication with out and be very careful as we are now the outside towns and
 only a stage mail due for a spell of tough luck delivery twice a week however the about eight o
 clock in the evening people were very hospitable and we we noticed that it was beginning to were given something
 to eat a go od cloud up and look like rain as we clean bed for the night and a
 dandy hadn t any shelter we decided to try breakfast and make lethbridge we figured that about eight o clock
 next morning it by doing a cross country flight we could stopped raining and by ten it had dried land
 at lethbridge shortly after dark up considerably a number of men gave and be able to make the landing without
 us a hand to get the plane on dry lights on the home field after taking off ground we fixed
 the tube secured a and flying steadily for half an hour it contract to come back in a month s
 time began to thunder and lightning and fin to give a flying exhibition and finally ally to rain in a
 heavy downpour the galloped off the clouds were still low bursts of thunder almost shattered our and at eight hundred
 feet we stuck old ear drums and the rain drops hit our face maud s nose up into them and
 climbed arid arms with the velocity of cobble to three thousand feet where we came stones we first tried to
 climb above the out into a bright sunshine no sign of storm but realized with night coming earth was visible
 and the change from on we might easily get lost above the dull grey skies to clear bright blue was
 clouds so we decided to land we came great we flew by dead reckoning as down to within five hundred
 feet of we did not have a compass and after the ground and picked up a small settle forty five
 minutes following a time scale ment we made for this and on circling we had made before leaving we dove
 over the houses locating a field the down through the clouds and came out noise of the engine brought everyone
 right over the coulee about two miles out as we finally swooped down to a south of lethbridge viaduct and
 pointed field in the centre of the village men square for the city a glance at one anwomen children dogs
 even some horses other and a grin of sheer joy made us and a cow or two came over to
 investi feel wonderfully exhilarated and in a gate the strange visitors that the storm moment we were on the ground
 and had apparently brought in we landed taxing to our hangar in a small sea of mud and water and
 the next day we were out again one wheel struck a rock and burst an and for the next six
 weeks the luck of inner tube we unloaded our ropes for the helmet followed us hitting us one securing the
 plane and wallowed a awful wallop in the pocket book on our round in the mud to ascertain the dam
 flight to verdigris coulee we had a age to the wheel flying contract there with a farmers then i noticed
 the vanguard of picnic eighteen miles from a railroad people coming up on the run and said and close to
 the united states border for heaven s sake jack look at the people for hundreds of miles around mob coming
 we must have scared the were gathered there for an old time dickens out of everyone palmer looked western picnic
 and in spite of hard ruefully and said wait until they times and crop failures one of the largsee us
 they will think we re something est gatherings which had ever attended the cat dragged in we both burst out
 those picnics was there laughing at our bedraggled appearance we had some difficulty finding the we were soaking wet and
 covered with place as all the direction we had was mud the rain running down our faces that it was
 eighteen miles from milk and necks right into our boots helmets river town and to follow the river until 25
 tragedy struck the fledgling aircraft company in 1920 when their plane crashed during a picnic at verdigris coulee no one
 was injured in the mishap we saw a large gathering of people the undercarriage off completely broke as the milk
 river twists and turns until the propeller and various rigging cables it resembles a coiled rope in places the lady
 was helped out and was fifty we had some job trying to explore every yards away before someone called her
 coulee and hollow however we finally attention to the fact that the plane was located the spot picked out a
 place a wreck she was greatly astonished and landed we were immediately be and said she expected the landings were
 sieged by many prospective passengers always rough and for that reason she and should have had one of the largest
 thought everything was lovely days in our history of passenger carry i made arrangements with a farmer ing to come
 after us the next day with two the day was insufferably hot not teams and wagons to haul the plane
 a breath of wind in the whole valley over to the railroad where we would and while we were taking
 out the front ship it to lethbridge palmer and i then control stick and disengaging the rudder started to strip
 the plane taking off controls a noise like the explosion of the wings and dissembling her for shipa small bomb
 made everybody scatter ping this is a long job and every few we found that owing to the terrific heat
 minutes we would have to take after the inner tube we had repaired at glen someone who was trying to
 collect souwoodville had blown out we repaired venirs in many cases the souvenirs this as quickly as possible and started
 were tools or vital parts which could in to fly with our first passenger who only be replaced at great
 expense we was a lady school teacher of that were still working when the picnic broke vicinity up and people
 began to move off about the plane took off flew the required two o clock in the morning we laid
 time and on coming down to land the down under the remains of the plane wheel struck in a badger
 hole and broke and tried to sleep as i had left leth off went the wheel the axle drove into
 bridge that morning figuring on being the ground and the plane was pulled back at night i did not even
 bring a around it broke off one wing wiped coat but was in my shirt sleeves and 26 helmet nights
 on the prairies are us this fellow was very funny and with ually quite cool and we did not get
 his comical antics and remarks chased much sleep the gloom from us and made us see the funny side of
 our latest predicament about daybreak we got up and found he left his friend the bootlegger and that we had
 one cigarette between us attached himself to us and later when this we divided and between puffs the farmer appeared
 to haul the machine palmer remarked fitz if we had pulled into milk river he gave us every assisoff half
 the adventures and grief in tance we parted with him at milk river france that we have had with this
 plane and there learned that he was a well we would both have about two pails known character along the
 border we of medals i agreed but stated i would loaded our plane on a flat car and cheerfully trade
 my interest in medals brought her to lethbridge this accident for a big greasy sausage a slice of hit us
 right during our busy season bread and one blanket when we had many fair contracts the we then decided to
 wander across cause was the inattention of a hired to the river and try and find some lunch mechanic whom
 we were forced to disthat might have been forgotten by some miss later on the wheel came off picnicker great
 was our joy to find four owing to a worn cotter pin which broke buns with some kind of canned
 meat when the wheel struck the badger hole between they were as hard as rocks it was three weeks before
 we got as they had apparently been thrown the plane rebuilt most of the repairs away the day before we
 next speared having to be sent from toronto howa couple of empty pop bottles and were ever we repaired her
 ourselves and going to fill them at the river when i since then for the sake of economy and noticed
 the rear wheel of an auto some safety we have always done our own distance away behind a clump of
 cotton rigging and mechanical work woods we went up to examine this and found an auto with three men in
 it one at another town during a lull in just awoke and the other two asleep the passenger service hundreds
 came we said good morning and told him around to examine the machine and who we were he was just
 as frank and finally an argument broke out among told us that he was a bootlegger and some former soldiers
 as to the name and had been selling hooch the day be type of the plane one stated that it
 fore as he had not sold out until late was a scout another that it resembled at night he decided
 to stay until morn a certain hun machine and so on one old farmer who was a later arrival eling
 bowed his way into the crowd looked about this time one of his compan over the plane for a moment
 and then ions woke up and loudly demanded a pointed to the wire and said why snort his friend told
 him that he hadn t man it s a damn ford look at the hay any but this did not
 appear to have wire any effect upon the snort requester who got out of the car and started to search
 i have found by experience that every small clump of bushes finally he women take to flying more naturally than
 men we have carried equally as dropped on all fours and crawled into a bunch of shrubs until only his
 heels many women if not more than we have were sticking out and later emerged men and on their first
 flights they apwith a bottle about one quarter full pear to have more nerve a woman is he at once
 put this to his mouth and a mighty hard proposition to scare believe me lowered about half of it into
 him he then ran around the car two or three at a town southeast of lethbridge times barking and imploring
 us to show of the fifteen passengers we carried only him a rattlesnake as he wanted to bite one was
 a man the strange thing about it to take away the taste of his own the whole proceeding was that
 each booze he then offered us the bottle but woman passenger was heavier than the seeing the effect it had
 on him we were last and as i had sold all the tickets afraid to tackle it among the crowd
 i did not notice this 27 fact until they were called for their through the bottom and back to earth
 flights but no such thing happened that good the day was very hot and the air old plane gallantly decided
 to make the did not have any body or lift to it con best of a bad job and struggled
 gamely sequently as the passengers kept get around the field they never got over ting heavier the plane showed great
 fifty feet at the highest finally my partreluctance to get off the ground and fly ner and his passenger came
 back to at any height we were getting worried earth he taxied up to me glared wiped and would have
 stopped only we felt the moisture off his face and said for that if we tried to explain the reason
 heaven s sake look inside and see they would lose confidence and would what s the matter with this engine
 i not fly in the evening the field was a am flooded out here the gas tank is mile square
 and absolutely level so we leaking or the carburetor or gasoline decided to carry on the name of the feed
 pipe or something and that woman next passenger was announced and in weighs a ton i looked down the rear
 wardly praying that it would be a light cockpit and sure enough a flood was one imagine our horror when
 out coming down from the direction of the stepped a graceful young gazelle weigh passenger s seat i went to
 the engine ing three hundred pounds if she weighed opened the door looked over everything an ounce carefully came back
 to palmer and i stole a look at palmer who was reported solemnly that the gas was not piloting sweat
 stood out on his brow leaking hut apparently the passenger and he shot an appealing look at me to was
 on helping her out i found that she do something i would have gladly had dropped her parcel which had
 given the woman back her money and broken it was a bottle of vinegar that ten dollars besides if she
 would only was causing the deluge by this time go away and hire a dray but what the lady was
 shouting out to her friends could i do she came over towards me how delightful flying was and was atand
 with a voice like a fog horn said tempting to rise it was no use she was how do i
 get into this contraption wedded to that seat as if she had been young man i feebly pointed toward poured
 into it i secured the assistance the seat and bent my knee for her to of a couple of spectators
 and we finally step on so that she could get into the were able to pry her out i thought
 at plane then began a struggle to keep one time we would have to saw the that woman from forcing
 me through the plane away from her she went away wing and into the ground as i held her highly
 delighted with the flight which up while she waved at all her friends she was explaining to her friends in
 i wobbled and perspired freely but fin detail the balance of the afternoon we ally with a superhuman effort i
 boosted picked very carefully our passengers her up into the seat which was not particularly during the heat of the
 day nearly big enough she then loudly de and were kept busy until dark as the manded her parcel which
 someone was result of that particular flight which holding for her i advised her not to was much enjoyed by
 the spectators take it but she stated that the party many times we have taken advanmight be gone when she
 came down tage of heavy gales which were favorand wanted her bottle shaped parcel at able to use when making
 flights on difonce during all this time i did not look ferent journeys we have made a speed at palmer
 who i knew was ready to of one hundred and twenty miles per mutiny he told me after that if
 i had hour in a curtiss plane quite often have come near him he would have hit me we also
 been compelled to combat a over the head with a wrench head wind but we never did it from i
 swung the propeller and watched choice as a heavy headwind in a smallthe old bus do her doggondest to get
 powered plane is an expensive proposioff the ground she ran for half a mile tion and eventually staggered into the
 air on one occasion we were starting as soon as the wheels were clear i out from lethbridge to fulfill
 a contract expected to see the passenger come right in the mountains one hundred miles 28 cowley was one of
 the many southern alberta towns which saw its first aircraft when palmer and fitzsimmons visited in 1920 21 this first
 aerial view of the town was taken during their visit west after climbing to a height of 6 000 west
 winds combating each other and feet we flew for fifteen minutes and caused by the peculiar position of the never
 moved over a mile forward we mountain to the valley eventually climbed to 7 500 and got en on another
 of our flights in 1920 tirely out of the wind and went away at through the mountains of the crowsour
 usual speed we have never yet nest pass we were flying to coleman been able to completely figure out the
 to give a stunting exhibition it was prairie winds sometimes on the ground impossible for us to land and operate
 it is quite calm and a few hundred feet with passengers with safety owing to up it is blowing a
 gale at other times the absence of a proper field so we there may be a small hurricane on the
 started from cowley at the beginning ground and at one thousand feet not of the foothills the flight through the
 a breath of wind pass and the beautiful panorama below on one of our flights up the crows cf the
 various mining towns and mounnest pass we came to a mountain called tam peaks struck me as wonderful it turtle
 at frank this is almost at right was the fall of the year september 1 st angles to the valley
 through which the to be exact and the color effect was railroad runs i have known times when particularly striking
 an east wind was blowing at frank a to get a better view up the valley west one blowing at
 blairmore only a we pulled the plane over one of the hills mile away and the change was always the
 top of which would be about three noticeable at a small bridge about half hundred feet below us my attention
 way between the two towns and 0 p was called by palmer to dozens of forms posite the base of
 the mountain jumping and apparently quite frantic on the day of our flight when di from the noise of the
 engine and the rectly over this point at an altitude of shadow of the plane on the ground at 2
 800 feet we were flying along serenely first i thought they were horses or cattle with a light wind of
 a few miles an hour but they moved so gracefully that i from the west opposing us all of a
 realized they were deer i decided then sudden the bottom appeared to drop and there that i would get a
 motion out of the whole universe and we fell picture of that country as i felt it would almost one
 hundred feet straight down be saleable and enjoyed in the east the surprise was so great to both palmer i
 spent the winter endeavoring to and i that we thought one of the wings obtain a motion picture camera and
 to had given away we could not associate interest people in photographing the it for an instant as a bump
 or an air mountains and other scenes throughout pocket i can only account for this as the country in the
 spring i signed a flying into a great vacuum caused by contract with motion pictures ltd of the vortex or
 whirlpool of the east and calgary to supply the camera and 29 through their connection with the picture film company
 of montreal to whom industry to market the film the first the negative had been sent a tracer picture to
 be taken was the crowsnest was then put on the film and i quote pass followed by the guy weadick
 from their letter of july 29 th our ranch prince of wales ranch waterton broker was given this film shortly
 after lakes the mormon temple at cardston it was received from you to ship to new and others york duty
 prepaid the day after he on may 24 th 1921 we appeared in received it he was struck by a
 motor cowley for a flying exhibition and the fire engine and is still in hospital sufcamera and an operator were
 to be sent fering with concussion of the brain as down from calgary to join us on the his assistant
 did not know anything 25 th the party appeared but as it was about this shipment and as we thought
 a dull and windy day he did not think it had already been sent and were in the light would
 be good enough the constant communication with pathe next day turned cold and windy and news of new york and
 not getting a again our friend decided the light was reply we imagined they had the neganot right however my
 partner and i tive all the time we received a wire held a consultation of war that evening from them
 saying they had not received and decided that light or no light mr it and we immediately put a tracer
 on picture man was going up in the ma it and discovered it to be still in the chine to
 get those pictures if we had to broker s office however on august gag rope and tie him in 29
 th we finally received our share of money for the picture and the event was the plane was fueled and
 oiled the closed camera securely bolted on and charged when we first started flying mr with film and at daylight
 se woke mr feinstein a well known lethbridge man man up and told him to make haste to used to
 come out day after day and get pictures by the first light before the walk around the plane emitting a
 heartwind got up it was frightfully cold out rending groan apparently of astonishand had every appearance of snow in ment
 this kept up for a week and i the mountains decided that possibly the man wished the light was the
 only thing that to go up but was a little uneasy i was worrying us but finally old sol finally
 went up to him and asked him popped his head out and smiled we if he would like to make
 a flight he jammed mr camera man into the plane backed away in terror at the idea and on account
 of the board across the cock answered no no of course not i pit to which the camera was bolted
 he said we noticed you were interested could not sit down nor stand up only in the machine and thought
 possibly you crouch wished to fly no he replied i have the next hour was the longest i ever been
 vatching you flying every day and put in i was just about to telephone for the life of me i
 can t figure oud vat the pass towns to see if anyone had makes the vings flop seen the plane
 come down when i heard another time a certain lady school the finest music in the world the steady teacher
 asked us the most amazing rhythmic roar of a perfectly tuned air questions and kept us so busy answerplane engine
 high up in the sky my ing her that she would not allow us partner and machine came into view
 time to get our passengers aboard and and made a perfect landing they were out finally as i was getting
 extremely both almost frozen and i had to rub fed up i referred her to my partner palmer s and
 our cameraman s hands to he asked her if she would like to go get the circulation back in them
 up and she got quite indignant at the some six weeks later we still had suggestion she considered it was
 not not received any money for this picture the least bit dignified for one of her and consequently did not
 like to take standing to engage in flying but confurther scenes until we were sure they fided she wished her
 pupils to write were saleable finally we wrote our cal an essay on the airplane and wanted gary concern and
 they wrote specialty to get all information possible 30 she then turned to me and said concern on the pacific
 coast has flown young man what happens if your for two years with the oriental mails engine stops when you
