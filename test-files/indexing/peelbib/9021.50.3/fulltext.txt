 i summer 2002 brokovski from 1905 he was retained as a local counsel by the canadian pacific railway in the
 construction of the toronto sudbury and the georgian bay and seaboard branches in 1903 brokovski married harriett ann noble whom
 he had known since his childhood years at craighurst the wedding took place at the historic trinity church in new
 york ann was the descendant of reverend roger williams the co founder of rhode island and an advocate of religious
 liberty her ancestors were united empire loyalists in december 1910 brokovski applied for admission to campbell fawcett law firm in
 macleod alberta three months later he was admitted to the alberta bar 2 for the next two years he was
 busy with small town practice the three court cases in which he acted as solicitor published in the alberta law
 reports of that period dealt with the intricacies of the interpretation of landlordtenant agreement agreement of sale and workmen s
 compensation act all three demonstrated not only brokovski s ample legal knowledge and clarity of arguments but also prudence applied
 in the interest of his clients in 1913 brokovski moved to calgary and joined the largest law firm in the
 city lougheed bennett mclaws co during his nine years with the company until its dissolution in 1922 he was one
 of its few senior legal practitioners in this period he also completed his education by obtaining llb from the university
 of alberta in edmonton in 1915 in 1919 he was nominated king s counsel in 1922 he was elected president
 of the calgary bar association 4 at the time when brokovski joined lougheed bennett mclaws co the busy firm needed
 experienced lawyers after r b bennett was elected to parliament in 1911 both of the company s principals spent most
 of their time in ottawa and the partnership lost its major legal talent bennett s place in the legal practice
 of the firm was partially taken over by brokovski and to a larger degree by alexander macleod sinclair when the
 latter joined the company in 1916 it is impossible to trace back now all the cases brokovski was involved with
 at that time two examples listed below simply illustrate his role in the firm in 1914 brokovski acted as co
 counsel with bennett in the case of raffan v canadian western natural gas light heat power limited the same team
 represented the defendant in the case of the riverside lumber company limited v the calgary water power company limited in
 1915 in both cases the defendants won the trials and the appeals by the plaintiffs the original verdict in the
 second case was reported in the calgary herald under the headline flood damages suits dismissed mr justice ives finds water
 and power companies not to blame in 1918 when bennett after expiration of his term in parliament returned to calgary
 the company underwent major changes the name mclaws disappeared from the firm s name one of the lawyers was dismissed
 his debts to the company still on its books in the middle of the 920 s in 1920 alexander hannah
 who had been briefly with lougheed bennett mclaws and co in 1912 rejoined the company after closing down his own
 firm at that time brokovski the place of honour at front and centre was accorded to lawyer john brokovski during
 this ceremony in 1940 the occasion was a farewell party for young polish men enlisting in the army ualberta history
 summer 2002 the events described allerwards as a piece of ca ary lolkiore left brokovski with a deep scar that
 did not heal during hk ii feti me in a memo to the executor of his ii dated almost thirty
 years later his instructions were as follows please do not in any way have or perin t anyone in any

 1930 until his retirement brokovski practiced by himself while only a few of his cases in that period were reported
 they give some insight into his legal practice the following two are interesting because they touch on the beginnings of
 the oi industry in alberta and also because in both of them brokovski represented clients who brought actions against the
 companies defended by bennett hannah sanl rd in the case o mason et al v livingston ct al brokovski acted
 for the plaintiffs one of the defendants mid west oi co was represented by bennett hannah sanford r b bennett
 was at that time the majority shareholder of the mid west oil co owning 55 of its stock the case
 goes back to 1917 when the so called promoters of mid west oil co allegedly conceived a plan to acquire
 the assets of western pacific oil co ltd and north west pacific oil co ltd and or this purpose fonned
 a new company m id wesi oil co as a rcsult of the scheme the original shareholders of the two
 former companies are said to have obtained only was the senior lawyer in the partnership the only king s counsel
 except sinclair and the two principal partners the changes nposed by bcnnctt in 1918 and the structure of the share
 of the profits introduced in 920 caused tensions judging by the available accounts it seems that the breakup was imminent
 the problem was how to get rid of bennett an earl icr attempt by senator lougheed to end the partnership
 in 1912 did not succeed because bennett was opposed no wonder that when the word spread in 1922 that bennett
 was contemplating leaving hi legal practice in calgary those who wanted him out took this opportunity to have their way
 the coup d etat implemented by loughccd s adherents succeeded bennett was finally removed 7 in the process however those
 who were not in the plot suffered brokovski was deeply hurt by the frontiertype of actions that lol lowed not
 only was he evicted from the office after nine years with the i rin hut was foiced to defend himsel

 on the matter were made clear in 192 i when as a suznee of the nomination when the bennett firm

 years he left provisions in his will that neither w h mclaws seen here or any of his sons should

 perhaps interesting to note that edwards he endorsed the person whom he brokovski s high position in the diocese considered
 to be an honest and well administration coincided with the episcopate principled man 23 on the other hand of canadian

 the united states the man who told the readers of a paper in england that a number of the people
 of canada were looking towards annexation with favor is very niuch out of touch with the people of canada there
 is no annexation sentiment in canada and there hasn t been any annexation sentiment for many many years and there
 never was any very decided sentiment in the days of depression in 1892 3 4 5 when the people of
 canada were passing across the boundary line in large numbers there were some people mostly residing in toronto who thought
 that as all the canadians were on the way across the line it might be better if the line could
 be shifted further north and save moving expenses but now that it is the other way and the americans are
 doing the moving there is no reason why there should be any annexation talk or any annexation sentiment and there
 is neither annexation talk nor annexation sentiment occasionally there is some fear expressed that canada will become americanized and that
 the influence of the vast swarm of americans into this western country will eventually result in an annexation sentiment the
 albertaii is not alarmed calgary is about the centre of the american invasion there is no annexation sentiment here there
 is never a word about annexation there was never a word expressed in public in favor of annexation or looking
 towards annexation anything that has been said by american people upon the subject has been quite the reverse the american
 settler expresses the opinion that he is well satisfied with conditions and in many respects prefers canada to the united
 states the only place that the writer of this article ever heard expressions favorable to annexation was in the city
 of toronto and that was some years ago if canada continues its fair treatment of all settlers and does not
 make too much of an effort to divert the channels of trade from its natural course there is no danger
 of any annexation sentiment in any part of canada the alberta calgary july 2 1910 alberta history summer 2002 in

 dry and only one flock of ducks there by mr oldharn then communicated with rev mr goodman who was serving
 as an kay dee anglican missionary with his headquarters at hutchinson s trading post at lauierton editor s note during
 the dry period of the some 35 miles east of lacombe great depression hunters complained about the shortage of water
 in ponds and the rev mr goodman wrote back and said that resulting scarcity of ducks this prompted a good
 duck shooting could be obtained pioneer citizen identified only as k d or around buffalo lake and if oldharn could

 up a party to go to buffalo lake jn october 1895 f m oldham who had recently arrived in calgary

 made to make duck shoot he got together a small party the trip we boarded the train at calgary on
 and went out to sullivan s slough north the morning of october 9 1895 and arrived east of calgary where
 there formerly had in lacombe about 3 o clock that afternoon been good duck shooting the party at that time
 lacombe consisted of the returned in a couple of days and reported station section house hotel general store alberta history
 summer 2002 livery stable and blacksmith shop hotel and recently come out from england to take up mounted police shack
 as we would have land between lamerton and red deer we to make the rest of the journey by horse
 and also met mr hutchinson and matthew rig we spent the rest of the afternoon trying cook the latter being
 a half breed indian to hire a conveyance which we could use who was to be our guide and cook
 during during the balance of the week we expected the time we were camped out near buffalo to be away
 we met with no success lake however as the livery stable s supply was limited and they did not want
 to hire out a the next morning we loaded our tents and conveyance for that length of time finally outfit
 on matthew s wagon and our with the aid of the hotel proprietor we got buckboard and headed for buffalo
 lake i an indian cayuse from some indians and do not remember the distance we traveled rustled an old buckboard
 and an old set of that day but we did not see any water until harness both of which we
 had to repair we arrived at the west end of the lake just after dark and camped at a spot
 which next morning we hitched up the cayuse matthew had decided upon loaded our outfit on the buckboard and set
 out for lamerton about 8 30 we headed practically due east from lacombe they enjoyed the stew immensely following a
 wagon trail over dry baidheaded prairie our little cayuse did until at the end of the meal not seem anxious
 to travel and needed lots when i informed them it was of encouragement to get him to move at even
 a slow walk by noon we had not got made from muskrats which matthew halfway to lamerton but we saw
 some willow bushes a short distance north of the had killed during the day trail and headed over there in
 hopes that we could find water and wood enough to cook a meal and water the cayuse we found that
 we were up again at daylight and while the willows were growing on the edge of a matthew cooked breakfast
 we amused small creek which was dry except a small ourselves trying out our rifles at some pool formed by
 a seepage or spring we coyotes and foxes which were prowling watered the cayuse and picketed him out to graze
 and then cooked bacon and tea and along the shore of the lake at the edge of the water which
 was some 300 yards had our lunch before leaving the willows distance from the ordinary high water mark to continue
 our journey we cut a couple of stout willow switches and for the rest of i had an old martini
 henri sporting rifle the trip one of us held the lines while the which was built lighter than the regulation
 other kept pounding the cayuse on the tail we thus made much better time for the army martini henri but
 shot the same balance of the journey the only water we heavy calibre cartridge and kicked like a saw after
 leaving the willows was in a mule matthew who had never seen one stream which i think was on the
 pariby before was very anxious to shoot it after i ranch not long before we reached had told him that
 it would kill things half a lamerton at which point we arrived about mile away i cautioned him about the
 kick 6 30 in the evening and handed him the rifle he stood up and casually took a shot at
 some birds away out on arriving at hutchinson s trading post on the water and then took a seat on
 the which was all there was at lamerton we ground and commenced rubbing his were welcomed by rev goodman and
 bert shoulder he never wanted to shoot that and fred sinclair two young men who had rifle again alberta history
 i summer 2002 after breakfast we hitched up again and informed the newcomers was duck stew headed north for white
 stick lake where they enjoyed it immensely until at the end matthew said we ought to find lots of ducks
 of the meal when i informed them it was and geese we altived there about noon made from muskrats which
 matthew had and found it to be a lake about half a mile killed during the day long with lots
 of arms and bays and surrounded by trees and bush there were on the following jay the ducks and geese
 lots of birds on it when we first arrived and started coming back to the lake but as there we
 looked forward to a good afternoon and was no regular flight we did not get rnllch evening shoot shooting until
 just before dark when we bagged a couple of dozen incoming we camped on the east side of the lake
 mallards and a couple of geese as we had where a swampy arm ran east just north of to start
 or home the next mori 1 in that was the camp we thus had water on our west all the
 shooting we zot on our iomz trip flank and also on the north we had just except a few prairie
 chicken which we ran finished dinner and were setting up the across in a patch of bush that had escaped
 tents when we smelled smoke in a few the fire on our way back to lainerton minutes the air in
 the north west was full of it and the ducks and geese in the lake most of the journey back
 to laconibe was began to rise and hit out for buffalo lake over black burned prairie and we were told
 the sinclair boys ran through the trees to the edge of the lake and got one goose as that the
 lire had traveled about 100 miles they were going over but in a short time before it was stopped the
 smoke hid everything and our expected afternoon shoot was spoiled the tire had the author then compared the drought come
 from the north west around conditions in 1895 to the dirty thirties wetaskiwin and the only thing that saved people
 now 1937 talk about the country us from being burned up was the fact that being dry and the scarcity
 of ducks he our camp site was protected by the lake on said but compared to things as they were
 the west and the swampy arm on the north in those days there is lots of water and lots of
 ducks in the irrigation reservoirs and the next day we spent exploring the lake there will be many more ducks
 when the and adjacent slough but the ducks and wet years come again as they did in the geese were
 still scared of the fire and kept period from 1897 to 1903 when the lakes away from our lake although
 we did bag and sloughs filled up again and provided one or two odd ones for supper that night feed

 any great extent from wolves and not at all from disease while although the spear grass gets into the wool
 it does not seem to injure the sheep it is probable that the northern climate may have the effect of

 alberta history i summer 2002 over the winter of 1914 15 hedenstrorn bleiler was born in munroe county developed his
 own ideas for a long range wisconsin in 1874 his parents were from attack aircraft on one hand he did
 not baden in southern germany but they had want to risk sending pilots into the heavy lost everything when they
 fled to france in gunfire of the enemy lines but at the same 1848 after supporting anti prussian forces time
 he envisioned something more in the revolution eventually they effective than a long range missile the immigrated to the united
 states where their result was his unique invention which he children were born also called the automatically controlled manless aeroplane
 bleiler had moved to canada about 1903 starting the real estate firm of john bleiler the unmanned machine was designed
 co in partnership with his brother to take off fly at a given aftftude bleiler he never became a landed
 immigrant or canadian citizen but this did drop born bs or photograph not stop him from being appointed a notary
 enemy installations public or voting for the local liberal candidate in provincial elections he was and retu r fl to
 its starti fl g point active in the german and scandinavian communities but in spite of his own once he
 had perfected his plans on paper german background his facility with the hedenstroin looked for the funds to develop written
 language was limited bleiler might a working model realizing that one of his best be described as an opportunist fellow
 workers robert a elliott was a member of the canadian militia he thought when he learned of the invention bleiler
 the man might have useful military approached hedenstrom and offered to connections elliott was interested claiming promote it in exchange
 for a five percent commission by this time there was gossip that he was personally acquainted with sir that the
 british would pay a half million sam hughes canada s minister of militia dollars for such an invention if it
 worked and defence however he wanted the swede to perfect a working model before he when hedenstrom agreed bleiler gathered
 tried to contact the military authorities a few investors and tried to raise the money hedenstrom then made a tiny
 model of his he arranged for three real estate dealers invention and set out to find someone who louis a
 wright h j munton and a mr would finance the construction of the full stimmell to meet with the inventor
 and scale experimental craft he estimated it the manager of the northern crown bank would cost 5 000 to build
 in edmonton to negotiate a loan however in spite of the fact that the men could offer wetaskiwin although legally
 of city status real estate as security the loan was refused was really a small town on the railway line
 at this point bleiler pulled out of the between edmonton and calgary as in all negotiations but louis wright continued
 to towns gossip travels quickly and soon seek funds he visited r b bennett everyone knew of the exciting invention
 member of parliament for calgary and including a local real estate dealer john asked him to submit the blueprints of
 the aircraft to a british board established to jacob bleiler examine military inventions but like the alberta history i summer
 2002 embassy in washington d c the swede was aware that the united states was still a neutral country but
 if any persons from canada were caught making business deals with the germans particularly for military weapons they could be
 charged with treason hedenstrom was shocked by the proposal so he turned to his co worker robert elliott for advice
 the militia man became excited at the prospect of trapping a real german spy so he counselled the inventor to
 play along with bleiler to find out if he was really serious hedenstrom for his part liked the idea of
 playing the role of counterspy so he began a series of meetings with the real estate agent that carried on
 through late december and into the new year bleiler finally acted on the matter on christmas day when he wrote
 to count von bernstorff the german ambassador in washington informing him of the new invention and of hedenstrom s willingness
 to co operate he stated the invention purports to be a flying machine which without being manned can be set
 accurately to any point and that it will drop bombs automatically that it will vary less than six feet in
 the distance of one hundred miles that it will travel six thousand feet or more in the air and will
 take pictures automatically this portrait of john j bleiler was taken from his business etterhead others bennett wanted to be
 assured that a prototype had been successfully tested wright also tried unsuccessfully to convince the commanding officer of the military
 battalion in edmonton to encourage his men to contribute one dollar each to the experiment finally late in the year
 he found a french speaking dairy farmer near saskatoon who was willing to invest 3 000 in the experiment this
 wasn t enough but hedenstrom decided to use the funds to travel to new york to get an experimental model
 underway he was convinced that the technical work could not be done in canada but he had friends in brooklyn
 who had agreed to help when bleiler heard that the plans were going ahead and that the inventor was going
 to the united states he showed a renewed interest in the scheme accordingly he visited hedenstrom and suggested a way
 for him to raise the remaining amount needed to build the aircraft they could he said direct their appeal to
 the german he proposes to go to new york with his plans and have a machine completed and there give
 a demonstration then sell it to the highest bidder but if 1 personally could finance this i would see that
 this arrangement would not be carried out but that the land of my sympathies namely germany would be the country

 stating that hedenstrom right taking advantage of the sensationalism created by the bleiler case the empress theatre in edmonton obtained
 a second rate movie entit ed the flying torpedo and blatantly connected it to the affair it claimed the movie

 such invention or device should be used by the said german emperor against his majesty the king his soldiers subjects
 and dominions in the said war contrary to the criminal code 8 police testimony revealed that when bleiler had been
 arrested copies of his two letters to the german embassy had been discovered when hedenstrorn was examined he admitted to
 having been a tool of elliott in placing a trap for the gerrnan he was willing to play this role
 he said because he hoped elliott s influence with sir sam hughes would help him to market his invention he
 believed that he was playing the part of a detective and his visits to the germans in washington and new
 york had been for the sole purpose of collecting evidence you wouldn t deal with the germans yourself asked counsel
 no you wouldn t sell that invention to the germans no not for a million dollars not for five millions
 when bleiler took the stand he claimed the bleiler s lawyer tried to have the case whole incident had been
 a hoax to defraud thrown out of court after the crown had the german government he said he had submitted
 its evidence but his appeal was no sympathy for the german cause but denied he succeeded only in having two
 under cross examination he admitted that he of the charges withdrawn that of might have had arguments over the war
 conspiring with persons unknown and of but purely for the sake of argument and not trading with the enemy the
 other two because his sympathies were with the were allowed to stand germans 2 he also contended that it had
 been hedenstrom not him who had drafted bleiler s defence was a spirited one his the letters to the german
 embassy and had son daughter and housekeeper all testified devised the code they were to use in his defence claiming
 that hedenstrom had been an agent provocateur they said when the testimonies were concluded that the inventor had told them
 of a recent the judge made his charge to the jury incident where german government had paid 60 000 for
 fake submarine plans and his lordship in summing up alluded to that they should try to sell them the aeroplane
 invention according to bleiler s son his father commented there are two ways of selling the machine if it is
 good we will sell it to the english and if it is no good we will slip it to germany
 however his testimony relating to his father s innocence was weakened when the crown produced a letter from bleiler dated
 january 26 1916 indicating his plan to flee to the united states about the time he hoped the invention would
 be sold alberta history i summer 2002 the quiet little city of wetaskiwin was the scene of intrigue and charges
 of consorting with the enemy during world war one this view shows the stores facing tracks at right is fowler
 cos store supreme court the prisoner was permitted to post bail the reason for contesting the peculiar verdict became clear
 at the appeal hearing in february of 1917 at that time counsel for the defence claimed there was no such
 crime as attempted treason and therefore his client should be released when the four judges of the supreme court reviewed
 the case they unanimously agreed but with ominous conclusions as chief justice horace harvey stated several questions have been reserved
 the first of which is ‘ does count i of the indictment disclose any offence known to the law the
 code contains no provision for punishment on a conviction of an attempt to commit treason treason is a capital offence
 any person guilty of it being in the words of the section ‘ liable to suffer death no provision is
 made for imprisonment in the alternative but that does not aid the accused much in this case for if there
 can be no offence of attempted treason what is charged is in fact treason because the attempt itself furnishes the
 necessary overt act which undoubtedly is an offence known to our law 5 the chief justice clearly implied that there
 was sufficient evidence for bleiler to have been tried convicted and perhaps executed for treason however as this was not
 the original charge he ruled that the trial judge had erred in directing the jury and also that the charge
 could not now be altered he concluded by throwing out the conviction but adding the opinion that there was sufficient
 evidence for bleiler to be re tried on the more serious charge but the war hysteria of 1915 had passed
 and was replaced by the realization that the wholesale slaughter of canadian soldiers in the nature of the two charges
 against the accused the first being of attempted treason in endeavoring to sell to the german emperor an invention to
 the harm of his majesty and his subjects and the second of inciting hedenstrom to commit treason the case went
 on his lordship was one of the most peculiar and interesting that he had met with with regard to the
 invention his lordship remarked that the craziest ideas often turned out to be most valuable 3 after lengthy deliberations the
 jury concluded that it did not entirely accept bleiler s defence although they did believe that hedenstrorn had gone too
 far in persuading the german to commit certain acts accordingly they found him not guilty of inciting the inventor to
 commit treason but guilty of the charge of attempted treason however they included a recommendation for clemency because of the
 entrapment activities of elliott and hedenstrom before sentence could be passed bleiler s lawyer asked that judgement be reserved because
 of the peculiar verdict 4 until it went to the reserve division of the view of west pearce street in

 wetaskiwin ames 1916 16 edmonton bulletin oct 12 1916 october 12 a visit to calgary in 1882 on saturday last
 the weather being most delightful i started off for a trip to calgary i made the drive of i 10
 miles from fort macleod i in two days arriving late on saturday night and pitching my little tent on the
 edge of the beautiful bow river now beginning to rise with the spring flood and gradually losing its wonderful clearness
 as the muddy banks are being washed away by the rising water before me lay the most grand and wonderful
 scenery the mighty rockies looming up in the distance sparkling with never melting snow forming the most pleasir g contrast
 to the bright green of the wooded hills and rugged little rocky ravines rising and falling close before me the
 clear rapid river winding around the foot of the hills the little clumps of trees on the banks and the
 perfectly level lawn like country extending for many miles along the river unitedly form a scene which will be sure
 to draw to this place many lovers of nature s grand and beautiful vagaries but nature has been in many
 ways lavish in her gifts to this favored spot not only is it beautiful to look upon but also goodly
 to live upon here the pioneer will find the most fertile soil to be found in the territory he will
 find fuel both wood and coal a splendid river that will carry his produce for a thousand miles if need
 be to market and his leisure hours can be spent in the finest hunting and fishing to be desired he
 will find a climate unsurpassed in america warm in winter and not hot in summer surely a perfect paradise for
 an honest man manitoba free press may 24 1882 alberta history summer 2002 memories of the earlydays by austin brown
 in 1962 former blackfoot indian agent george h gooderham interviewed austin brown and prepared the following text it is now
 in the glenbow archives orn the time we left glasgow july 1 st 1889 we were eight days on the
 water we used sails when the wind was in our favour it took us six days to come from quebec
 to gleichen by train and then overland to queenstown amving there an jul y 14 th the grass was all
 yellow and i t was very hot there was onl y one rain t ha t year and onl y
 enoug h to settle the dust the ground did not freeze t ha t win t er i t wa
 s so dry de s p ite the temperature dropping to 600 below the winters remained that cold for several
 years and there was three feet of snow an the level there were 2 000 blackfoot indians on the reserve
 to the north of our home at that time all the men were well built standing six feet tall the
 women were tine looking too many of them were old and gray haired after the buffalo got killed off the
 next generation went down iii health and in fifteen years the band want to 750 as many died of tb
 now i i 9621 there are i 500 or more but not of the same fine physique of those of
 72 years ago i was 12 yeai s old when we canie to queenstown and i have three sisters younger
 than me we used to play with the indian boys and girls as there were no white kids to play
 with we picked up a lot of indian austin brown queenstown pioneer words and have not forgotten them now most
 of the indians speak english when the indians got treaty money many would camp at our place on their way
 to visit the bloods and peigans they would stay overnight because there was water at our place and the next
 watering place was a bug way off the camp would include 15 to 30 tipis these indians were great for
 horse racing and bet their horses some would come hornc with fewer or none while others would have a lot
 more they always took extra horses on these trips mother would doctor the indians and would hum tunes while rllbhin
 2 their hacks and chests from this she got the name hurnmim woman the second year we were in the
 coulitly father bought 16 cows in 17 years they increased to herd of 8 x we sold a ot and
 sonic died of old age one year 65 calves died of black leg there was no cure for that at
 that time d alberta history summer 2002 the winter of 1906 07 was bad 1906 had during the winter when
 cattle could not he been a dry year and the grass did not grow so dipped to remove the mange
 sulphur and we could not get hay for winter feed that hot water were the main ingredients used in winter
 was very cold and the snow deep it large cattle dips to drench the cattle and kill crusted and then
 it was 400 below zero for 6 the mange they would swim through the weeks it was sure cold the
 cattle drifted mixture hardwick kept a supply of sulphur south and even over the american border at but during this
 winter he did not use it he the end of two years we gathered only 300 used coal oil until
 he ran out of it head out of 800 i was batching when 1 looked after these old the second
 year we were in the country we cows and douglas had left me a bag of flour started with 4
 heavy mares the horse herd and also a sack of sulphur we got them increased to 30 head when swamp
 fever mixed and tried to make bread from the killed all of them indian ponies did not die wrong sack
 we only found out when it we had used a stallion which weighed 1200 would not rise while there about
 25 timber lbs so the first cross with indian pony wolves came to visit me i could hear them mares
 made good saddle horses later on running on the snow so i took a shot at them father used heavier
 stallions until we sold in the dark and they ran away next morning horses weighing from 1 400 to 1
 800 lbs 1 went to see if i hit any but found that the he had started with indian pony
 mares that bullet had struck the ground in front of the weighed 600 lbs or less finally we had pack
 and had scared them off over 600 head we don t get the black chinook winds we cur home was
 the post office used to get in winter one chinook wind took off 3 feet of snow in 3 days
 the hot wind in the beginning felt like standing over a hot stove and my father called ft queenstown our
 home was the post office in the beginning and my father called it at the lazy h ranch the corral
 and sheds queenstown then a village sprung up near were down a deep coulee while the house our farm and
 it got the post office i moved was on the bank about 50 feet higher up i there in 1928
 and was in business for myself spent some time alone there at one time i went to work for douglas
 when we were young we had many hardwick owner of the lazy h ranch as a experiences one of my
 sisters now mrs ranch hand and remained on that job for a year wilson used to go out riding alone
 at times in the winter i had to haul hay from a stack one day when she was not far
 from home with a wagon to feed 50 old cows it was a five she came upon what she thought
 was a mile haul and the snow was so deep in places coyote it was bigger than others she had
 that i had to shovel out a road when seen and it turned and growled at her instead hardwick found
 this out he said that would of running away after relating the incident never do and he would go to
 gleichen and get a to father he told her to mix a poison bait and set of bob sleighs for
 me to use he was away leave it where she had encountered the three days and during that time a
 chinook came animal the animal returned and died on the up and took off the snow douglas had a hard
 time to get home and i could never use the spot it was a timber wolf weighing about sleighs the
 rest of that winter 150 pounds this was just one of many incidents in the it was a year when
 the cattle were mangey ranchers often rubbed coal oil into their pelts life of teenager sixty years ago alberta history
 i summer 2002 d did not entertain the slightest hope of catching a glimpse of the noble animal in his
 wild state by this time trains will no doubt be running on the canadian pacific railway as far as calgary
 but a few weeks ago everything gave way to construction those of the public who wanted to go west could
 take such accommodation as the caboose or the cars loaded with ties or rails afforded on the day that 1
 left medicine hat the whole was inconveniently crowded there being in addition to the ordinary travel ten men of the
 north west mounted police en route to strengthen the force at calgary about three hours after starting when the monotony
 of the rolling prairie was getting rather irksome suddenly there arose a cry of a buffalo and sure enough about
 a mile ahead and running parallel to the track was a big bull buffalo pegging away for dear life i
 say pegging because it expresses his gait which is not a good swinging gallop but quick short steps keeping his
 feet well under his body his big head being very close to the ground many were the speculations as to
 whether he would turn off before we came up to him but a buffalo like an englishman follows the trail
 of his predecessors and as this happened to run parallel to the track of the canadian pacific railway our friend
 though a locomotive must have been a startling novelty elected to race with us it was slightly up grade for
 the train which was running about 15 miles an hour and very much so for the buffalo but he made
 good time uphill and it was fully a mile before we overhauled him by that time the mounted police had
 got out their carbines and anyone who sported a revolver produced it so that from the windows the platforms and
 the roof of the caboose as many muzzles protruded as from lieut doore s celebrated armoured train when making a
 reconnaissance of arabi s lines the crack shot of the police a ilullalo fiuiit on the 1 a fl 111
 iisjss by iu j j anonymous note this article by an unnamed correspondent appeared in the british newspaper the canadian
 gazette on above is a sketch of the september 20 1883 cpr train entering calgary about 1883 this was approximately
 the same time as the unique buffalo traveller who penetrates for the hunt first time to the far west by
 the canadian pacific railway is naturally much interested after passing moose jaw by the innumerable depressions in the surface of
 the prairies and which he learns to be the wallowing places of the buffalo as these occur in countless numbers
 for hundreds of miles some idea is gained of the extent to which that country was over run by these
 animals but as no buffalo have crossed the boundary line for three years this absence plunging the indians into dire
 distress we of course alberta history i summer 2002 was allowed the first shot as we came do not know
 presumably he must have nearly abreast and apparently he hit the strayed from some not very distant herd bull about
 the neck at all events he turned but the indians seemed quite unaware of short round but only for an
 instant and any being in the neighbourhood i feel then resumed his former course personally very grateful to him for
 having allowed me to see at least one buffalo in a for about two minutes we ran side by side
 wild state before very many years are past at about 250 to 300 yards distance a the race will become
 very rare indeed in perfect fusillade being kept up from the any case it has been and will be a
 very train no doubt the springs of a caboose on a construction train are not admirably by a railway train
 and for this reason i adapted for steadiness of aim but send you an account of it considering the broad
 flank of the buffalo and the amount of powder burnt i did think rare occurrence for a buffalo to be
 chased the construction of the canadiaii pacific that well never mind the buffalo soon thought he had shown us enough
 sport and railway line from medicine hat to calgary sheered off to the west and when lie had some 180
 miles has been accomplished put 1 000 yards between us was lost to view with a perfectly marvellous rapidity and
 over some rising ground but still there is no doubt that the engineer s apparently was going at as good
 a pace as promise to lay the track to the summit of when we first came upon him the rockies
 120 miles from calgary before the snow flies will he readily what the solitary animal was doing there i fulfilled
 the coyote an enthusiastic observer of the habits of the prairie coyote said the other day the hangdog look of
 the animal as he slips away from human sight is the cause of the coyote s bad name he is
 very shy at times but on occasion sits unconcernedly by the roadside as one drives along he is called sneak
 but he is only sly instead i ic has more wit than any animal except the fox he is as
 courageous in a fight with his own kind as any animal that breathes he is patriotic if any one may
 used the term in that he refuses to be domesticated refuses to leave the life of freedom to which he
 is accustomed he is the best family maii so to speak in the world the coyotes have been make outlaws
 through ignorance people think they know all about the coyote but they don t they think he is the meanest
 most cowardly sneak the personification of all that is vagabond in aninial nature but the naturalist knows that he is
 almost nothing of the kind the howl of the coyote in february is a love song and all the females
 within sound gather around when they hear a male sing all the males that hear him gather too they all
 start in for a frolic but the males are so ill tempered that they fall to wrangling immediately it is
 a most ferocious encounter how often do you hear people speak kindly of the knights who used to fight for
 their ladies he is a knight he has to fight for his love the coyote who survives in the fight
 takes his sweetheart and away he goes to the home he has prepared for her this is commonly a little
 cave among the rocks or one dug in the sand hill here is has a bed of dried grass and
 leaves and here she is installed a mistress she has no work to do and no care no taking in
 of sewing no scrubbing no washing no labor of any kind she does not even gather her own food she
 is simply the pet free to eat and frolic and play when the male is at home and sleep when
 he is away searching for food macleod gazette may 12 1892 alberta history i summer 2002 book revie by the
