 little kid picked up one day while waiting for my who had to walk a mile and a half to
 father at the blacksmith s shop so there school the first half mile on my own who said the english
 language was hard the dirt road was flanked on either side to learn in the fall of 1920 just a
 few by thick brush where i was sure coyotes months short of being six years old 1 waited to grab
 me i would run as fast as among the eighteen students started school i could to catch up with the
 other children at the crossroads sometimes were a number of children who because the new school was not quite even
 the bush rabbits scared me there ready we spent the next few weeks in an were so many of them
 this all changed spoke nothing but english the empty building in the village our first the following year when our
 neighbour s teacher was mrs martin she was an boy started school and we walked remainder of us had to
 dig in our older woman and her pupils ranged from together beginners like myself to those in their heels and
 start from scratch teens we were a motley crowd but mrs when winter came and snows were deep martin put
 up with us for the whole many children depended on a sleigh ride fortunately for us mrs martin school term
 to school and home however this wasn t always possible as many men was a patient teacher she among the
 eighteen students were a spent the winter days cutting firewood number of children who spoke nothing logs rails and posts
 or cutting brush to established a good foundation but english the remainder of us had to clear more land on
 those days i stayed dig in our heels and start from scratch home until it warmed up so i could
 make fortunately for us mrs martin was a my way through the snow on foot for my own love of
 school patient teacher she established a good foundation for my own love of school winter clothing for girls was not
 adequate in spite of fleece lined bloomers and rib knit wool stockings we had double desks in school i shared
 the freezing wind would find its way up mine with an english speaking kid the dress and chill the whole
 body in no which helped a lot every day i learned time on those days i envied the boys a
 few more new words from my partner their warm wool mackinaws their long by the end of the year i
 was able to johns and their denim overalls make myself understood i had also started to read and print words
 when warm weather returned in spring and heavy snows began to melt it turned i would have felt good about
 my school the natural waterways into fast flowing work if it were not for the slate how i streams and
 the dirt roads into hated it i was seldom able to save my quagmires many children were forced to work
 to take home for my parents no stay home until the roads dried up then sooner had we finished one
 assignment the homesteaders would lay more logs than we had to erase it with a wet rag to crosswise over
 the muddy stretches the make room for the next one it was not log corduroy had to be repeated over
 until well into the second year we were time to stabilize the road in the allowed to start using pencil
 and meantime ditches were deepened and scribbler we then discovered how much culverts were built to re direct the water
 cheaper it was to use slate and slate into ditches and away from the low spots pencil paper and lead
 pencils cost money at a time when even pennies were our new school was built of lumber and scarce i
 remember carrying half a dozen painted white with a black roof because eggs in a lard pail to exchange for
 a it was not insulated it was hot in summer scribbler or a pencil at the local store and cold
 in winter a row of windows alberta history spring 1998 extended along the east wall along the the school yard
 was fenced in then west wall was the cloakroom where a divided in half one side for the girls the
 row of hooks held coats and caps a shelf other side for the boys at the far end of above
 the hooks held the lunch pails the each yard was the outhouse let it be said cloakroom also served as
 a washroom that the trip to the biffy was never with a washstand that held a pail of water pleasant
 be it summer or winter it was our new school was built of and dipper and a wash basin with
 a bar especially hard on the beginners when of soap one towel served us all they had to plow through
 the snow to get there and sometimes just couldn t lumber and painted white with a a pot bellied heater

 the weather for a hundred the old alexandra readers with the yards crowded around the heater while phonetic system of
 sounding words for and cold in winter their half frozen cousins shivered those who could not read on sight behind
 their backs waiting their turn to sounding out words often proved to be an warm up embarrassing experience when reading
 aloud in class at the front of the school room was the teacher s desk and chair on top of
 the as the years went on the size of the class desk were a few books a hand bell and
 increased reaching anywhere from forty the attendance register inside the top to forty five pupils ranging from grade right hand
 drawer lay a heavy black strap one to grade eight the teacher never used to back up the teacher s
 authority in had enough time to give individual help the room some teachers resorted to the in a day when
 there were no computers strap more often than others or calculators we had to train our minds to do the
 work for us we learned to spell on the wall back of the desk were two correctly by memorizing words

 of carols back in school i was hearing from other kids about the christmas tree and the santa claus with
 the long white beard who came in a sleigh pulled by eight reindeer and who left presents for children on

 up he jerked open the desk drawer and reached for the strap but the strap wasn t there there was
 an ominous silence i ll get another strap rest assured he said if you did it or know who did
 you d better speak up or you ll all get the strap i looked across the room and saw my
 little brother and sister crying there were other youngsters crying all scared out of their wits i knew what had
 happened was wrong but i also knew i didn t do it nor did i know anyone who did there
 was no way i was coming tomoltow to get strapped and neither would my younger siblings as it turned out
 an emergency meeting of trustees was called that night i never they reached their fifteenth birthdays knew what happened at
 the meeting but when they could quit their disruptions there was no school the following day in class soon affected
 everybody and the after that it was good friday and the strap began to make a daily appearance easter holidays
 were on without any improvements in behaviour when we came back after easter mr personally i was never strapped in
 springbett was gone in his place was a school but i felt sorry for many who young girl she was
 tall and she was were whispering in class or failing to beautiful she had a kind word for pick up
 scraps of paper off the floor everybody and a smile that went with it hardly seemed reasons for strapping for
 me i think it was love at first sight though miss eversman stayed with us at last there came one
 warm day in april for less than three months she remained when we were enjoying the sun during in our
 hearts for a long time after our lunch break for once we had a miss eversman was a good teacher
 just reason to be happy for the easter out of normal school in the weeks that holidays were coming up
 then the hand followed she worked hard and bell summoned us back inside encouraged us to do likewise even those
 who were indifferent pupils reacted to mr springbett having checked that her with respect the strap never once everyone was
 in lowered himself into his made it out of the drawer during her stay chair when a gasp of pain
 escaped his when it was time for her to go we felt lips he jumped up and pulled a wad
 of we were losing a friend i m no poet but gum from the seat of his pants a tack
 when miss eversman was leaving i was imbedded in the gum his face wrote her a poem something about her
 turned from red to purple being my guiding star at eleven going on twelve i guess you are allowed to
 be who did this sentimental above two views of students at opal at top is the class at a school

 d alberta history i spring 1998 in 1928 returning after the summer friction between the students for that holidays we
 found that a teacherage had reason we had our differences and our been built in the school yard to provide
 arguments but it didn t include our living quarters for mr and mrs browne backgrounds of origin at home we
 were a married couple with two children they taught to respect people whether young were up in years their daughter
 emmie or old before the year was up we was a quiet girl who had finished her learned that some
 people thought personally i was never grade eight and was living in the house differently with her father ned was
 supposedly strapped in school but i felt attending school where his mother was my friends in school were not limited
 by the teacher nationality or colour of skin my best sorry for many who were friend was michiko who was
 japanese in school we never knew when ned she was my age and in the same grade whispering in class
 or failing to would be in neither did we know which we walked together to and from school grade he
 would choose to honour when and exchanged little secrets like most pick up scraps of paper off the he did
 come in because he tattled on girls do everybody he had no friends but he didn t seem to mind
 he lived his life the floor hardly seemed reasons for an incident that precipitated the true way he wanted and
 in his parents eyes feelings of the brownes came on an early he could do no wrong strapping day in
 april there was a large expanse of ice in the girls yard where ned was the school year in grade
 eight was nothing to rave about mrs browne did spending his school time skating at lunch time the girls showed
 up and the best she could with the number of children she had to deal with and all the reminded
 him he wasn t supposed to be different grades when things would start on their side his answer was to
 thumb getting out of hand she would call on his nose while he kept on skating mr browne for help
 the strap was seldom used but the lectures were anna who had just recently arrived in frequent canada was a
 newcomer in our school she was ten years old and spoke no mr browne often pointed out that a lot
 english she stood enthralled at ned s of us were not civilized enough to be able skating but he only
 shouted for her to get to appreciate what mrs browne was out of his way next we knew he had
 doing for us our work ethics were poor struck her with his skate and she fell our manners lacking and
 on and on the down screaming a couple of girls ran to lecture always ended with a reminder of the
 teacherage to report what had how lucky we were to be living in a great happened country like canada with
 people like the brownes to teach us at one o clock the brownes came into the classroom with ned trailing
 mrs there were six of us in grade eight browne took her seat ned went to his trying to make
 the best of a poor desk and mr browne drew himself to situation at the end of the term we
 were his full height and scowled they did not to write departmental exams and i was acknowledge anna who was
 the victim determined to make it there was talk nor ask the class what had happened that within the year
 another room would be added to the school that would mean instead mr browne nailed us with we would have
 one room for grades one you bunch of foreigners you ll never to six and another would serve grades learn
 how to treat a british boy seven to eleven that was only for openers he pointed while there was an
 ethnic mixture of out all our faults and what poor ned had children in school i never felt any to
 put up with since they had come to this alberta history spring 1998 the last three years of my schooling
 went by fast mr reid was a native of nova scotia who had a bad temper and a sharp tongue
 he was of the fifth generation born in canada one day when he asked me what my nationality was i
 answered canadian after all i thought i was born in canada he cut me short and said it would take
 another five generations to be classed as canadian i never found out what was so great about the number five
 mr reid didn t have much use for foreigners he told us they were born with strong backs but weak
 brains he didn t think twice about calling a pupil a dumbell or a numbskull or a long streak of
 meat without a brain but he passed as a teacher and we took it all in our stride he taught
 us physics algebra geometry and science but it was mrs reid who taught us language literature and grammar she was
 great and i always looked forward to the three weekly lessons in her room it would not be right not
 to mention the school inspector s visits during my time in school there was only one inspector mr leblanc he
 was without a doubt a good inspector but he was a terror to both the students and their teacher when
 word got around that he was coming everyone went on alert the weaker students shrank into their seats hoping to
 escape his attention there was one girl who never failed to get a severe stomach ache and had to be
 sent home the teacher hovered in the background praying for the remaining students to prove to the inspector that he
 or she was instilling copious amounts of knowledge to prove the teacher s worth to the school it was mr
 leblanc s practice to question students at random and acknowledge the right answers with a nod of his head but
 a wrong answer or no answer would result in a sharp reprimand for not doing their work once he tossed
 a book across place we sat there like a bunch of scared rabbits not daring to say a word in
 defence oh ned how often i have remembered you i wonder how you faced life when you grew up the
 school year drew to an end in the last few weeks mrs browne gave lessons after school to a chosen
 few the remaining three of us were left to work on our own well i had made up my mind
 that i would study hard and pass which was exactly what happened while six of us wrote departmental exams i
 was the only one who made it in every subject two others came close and were allowed to rewrite one
 subject apiece next year there were only three of us in grade nine the addition to the school was finished
 in the fall of 1929 the school board had hired a married couple mr and mrs reid they would live
 in the teacherage mr reid was assigned to grades seven to eleven while mrs reid would teach the elementary grades

 were clubs rocks and what ever missiles came handy gave blackfalds about the liveliest time in its existence on friday
 and resulted in a hurry up call to lacombe arid edmonton for police protection three officers from edmonton and one
 from lacombe were on the scene and the trouble quickly quelled the battle resulted from the discharging of eighty graders
 who claiming that conditions were not satisfactory refused to work after vain y endeavoring to make them work the cpr
 paid them off and ordered them to leave the boarding cars where they were camped they refused to take the
 money or to leave the cars about 100 new graders were shipped in from edmonton by the cpr and set
 to work the discharged men threatened violence if they started operations but the work proceeded until evening when the newly
 employed men went to the cars for the night the ex employees who still had possession locking the doors refused
 to allow them in the new men attacked the cars with stones and logs which they used as battering rams
 to break down the doors the men inside hurled missiles of divers kinds everything from frying pans to scalding hot
 water through the windows severely burning a number of the attacking party when the doors were broken down a hand
 to hand fight took place both sides using clubs and other weapons many of the men received scalp wounds but
 there were no dangerous injuries the battle ended about 11 o clock the attacking party retiring to the bush a
 hundred yards away and camping there for the night as soon as the trouble arose the officials in charge of
 the work sent to the mounted police at lacombe for assistance but the one policeman who was there was unable
 to do very much with 160 enraged men he wired to edmonton for assistance and three more were sent by
 the midnight train to the scene of the trouble an ultimatum was sent to the men to the effect that
 if they did not get out and leave the neighborhood by this morning they would be arrested and sent to

 creating a figures in chuckwagon racing is the smooth powerful motion man who won thirteen calgary titles as an outrider
 but never won as a driver take for example edgar baptiste who orville strandquist strandquist s first won the 1996

 helps when guarantees neither did it charge an entry the horse gets working eh 4 fee strandquist put together his
 own outfit including some half thoroughbred excluding horses wagon racing saddle horses and never looked back generally has been a
 male domain from that year to 1991 strandquist although there have been a few raced at calgary a fifty year
 record that exceptions in 1979 the calgary will likely never be broken over those fifty years strandquist bought and sold
 many horses and heard the persisting urban controversy over chuckwagon racing s cruelty to horses in the sport s defence
 orville eloquently replied they call chuckwagon racing cruelty to animals they don t realize that those horses love to run
 and that to us they are like members of the family if we the wagon men hadn t bought them
 when they were retired from flat racing they d have been dead years ago they d have been taken straight
 to a slaughter house their meat sent to europe and their bones made into glue we give them ten maybe
 fifteen more years and we treat them well nobody wants accidents on the track but sometimes they are unavoidable a
 piece of the wagon or harness d alberta history spring 1998 breaks a horse stumbles a driver makes a mistake
 in judgement and then we get a wreck horses are faster now than they used to be and whenever there
 speed whether it s on the highway or anywhere else there s always a certain amount of danger but those
 people who say we aren t concerned about our horses are crazy as orville indicates chuckwagon racing is dangerous for
 both man and beast wrecks are not as common today but they still happen bringing injury and sometimes death at
 one time chuckwagons were advertised in the united states as death wagons or coffins on wheels in 1996 outrider eugene
 action jackson was the first chuckwagon fatality at the stampede in twenty five years the 1990 s also saw the
 death of two likable drivers richard cosgrave and george normand the bonnyville bullet not killed at the calgary stampede but
 in races on other western canadian tracks every time chuckwagons line up for the klaxon there is the potential for
 disaster with the spectre of injury in each heat it takes a special breed to be a chuckwagon driver kelly
 sutherland known as the king of chuckwagon racing hints of these qualities in his reported comments relating to normand s
 death sutherland remarked part of livin is dyin whether it happens here or crossing the street george knocked the top
 barrel and straddled the bottom one and i never seen that happen to him before i think that s just
 the way they wrote the book 7 the drive to be a chuckwagon driver is an addictive one and for
 seventy five years the addiction has been spread through and dependant upon a few prominent rodeo families ever since racing
 began it has been a family affair with entire clans assisting in caring fur the wagons and the horses from
 feeding the horses in the barns to cooling them down after a race family members support has been essential year
 round through family participation the talent of handling four stormy thoroughbreds has been passed down to sons and grandsons for
 in chuckwagon racing there are certain families near dynasties who excel at the sport initially it was only albertan families
 who competed and even in the 1990 s despite competitors coming from all over the west albertans continued to dominate
 the lauders glasses cosgraves s utherlands fletts bensmillers willards and dorchesters are family names that ring out with the tradition
 pride and championships of the sport it is also to the credit of these families that the sport has persisted
 and flourished for there is no training program for perspective drivers instead these families raise and train drivers by first
 initiating the boys to the care of horses to riding as outriders to driving pony chuckwagons and then finally the
 thoroughbreds these families have the patience and love to see the talent of the sport carry on left a chuckwagon
