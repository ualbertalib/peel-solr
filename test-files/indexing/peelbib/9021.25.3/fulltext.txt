 to be done 11 the progress made since august when the work was commenced seems marvellous mr stewart has not
 only the faculty of building difficult roads but he has com t t bined with it the faculty of building
 them so that they take in at different stages all the choice bits of scenery in the valley one of
 his greatest works in the partial ascent of tunnel mountain by a carriage road the different glimpses of the valley
 from this road are perfectly superb the the carriage road ascends about half way mountain is 1 000 feet above
 the valley and the rest of the distance there is a bridle path the top of this mountain is long
 and narrow and from its crest there is a grand view both ways i went to the top of this
 mountain mr stewart kindly acting as does not look much but i shall remember guide and one of the ladies
 of the party pluckily accompanying us all the way it it as one of the hardest pulls i ever had

 planned by him and locate there at the present time the gov carried out under his direct supervision it ernment

 road by john liss for many years the settlers on the north side of the paddle river flats had great
 difficulty in going to sangudo their near est market town and railroad the most logical route was along the range
 line which i crossed the paddle flats but this boggy land was almost impassable except in the winter when the
 ground was frozen solid 1 the range line was also the boundary be ‘ tween the municipal districts of pershing
 and kitchener and neither municipality wanted to assume the responsibility for building the road through the difficult terrain ‘ v
 i ‘ eventually the councillors of both muni i cipalities came to an agreement and started work on a joint
 project money was appro priated to lay half a mile of corduroy of poplar rails and logs over what was
 then a floating bog the intention was to cover the corduroy with soil as soon as it was dry enough
 but an unexpected flood carned almost all of the corduroy away fortunately poplar is not very buoyant and it did
 not float very far most of it was sal vaged with great difficulty at that tinie the district had a
 sympathetic m l a in the person of c milton mckeen he owned land several miles west of the range
 line and although his market town was rochfort bridge he realized the urgent necessity of building a road for the
 settlers of sangudo through mr several settlers were approached by mr mekeen the department of highways dele day to supply
 the material and to do the gated an engineer mr day to plan and work none was willing to undertake
 the supervise the road building mr day con work at the prices offered finally mr day ceived the idea of
 building a retaining wall came to me and after consulting with my through the hog to protect the grade from
 father we agreed to do the work and supbeing washed out during floods the wall ply the material at that
 time there was was to be four logs high of sound poplar a fine stand of virgin poplar forest on
 32 f et long with at least an eight inch father s homestead adjoining the flats we top nailed onto
 vertical tarnarac posts and undertook to do the work at the following to the abutments of bridges which were then
 being built a total of 410 poplar mr liss is a resident of sangudo logs and about 100 stout tamarac
 posts alberta the photo at top shows the were required paddle river bridge in 1910 13 prices poplar logs 1
 10 delivered tam side of the wall the ground was spongy arac posts eight feet long with eight inch and
 wet and mosquitoes and flies were top 1 00 each nailing the logs on 35 most annoying it was a
 very difficult task cents each digging post holes 35 cents but mr westerberg was a patient dutiful each the holes
 were to be five feet deep man and the job was well done but unexpectedly we found that underlying after
 the retaining wall was built we the bog were the charred remains of tam had a couple of very dry
 seasons there arac wood from three to four feet from were numerous grass and soil fires on the the top
 these offered tremendous diffi flats and wherever they got to the peat culties in constructing the wall soil or muskeg
 they were terribly hard to two months later the work was finally put out one summer the fire came to
 our done according to specifications a couple retaining wall where the peat and buckskin of neighboring settlers had been engaged
 were powder dry patrick kerr of sangudo to help with the job at 30 per month and was engaged to
 put the fire out and he board during the contract one of my best had two trucks with water tanks
 hauling horses for which i paid 200 got snagged water continually from the water tower at and we lost him
 when all the expenses sangudo for over two months with great were paid there was not much left to com
 effort the grade and bridges were saved pensate for the months of hard labour by but the fire destroyed the
 retaining wall my father and me completely at about the same time the several bridges that also were built over
 wooden bridge over the paddle created a the flat at that time were approximately jam of logs and debris and
 the bridge was eight feet high eighteen feet long and destroyed a second bridge was built this twenty feet wide
 the idea was that by time with new pilings driven in and abuthaving a retaining wail the flood water ments
 built stronger and higher in more would be forced to flow under the bridges recent years this bridge was replaced
 with and protect the grade to make the retain a steel structure which has so far withing wall effective and
 to dry up the bog stood several very high floods in addi mr westerberg sr a settler on the paddle
 tion the old corduroy is now a gravelled was engaged to dig a ditch alongside the road which in the
 wet seasons still tends retaining wall and to throw the dirt corn to sink into the bog posed of buckskin
 and peat onto the west boys will be boys the boys have found a new and cheaper method of gaining
 admission to the opera house than by paying their money or begging a pass from everyone who attends the new
 method is to enter by the coal cellar and then to work their way up they think it pretty small
 that lippington is set to watch this handy mode of ingress and they wonder if he remembers when he was
 a kid himself the same youths held a meeting recently and appointed a committee to protest strongly against any action
 being taken about the establishment of a curfew bell and strong resolutions were passed against either police or parents interfering

 by cypress hills and south by the international boundary in exchange the indians received reserves on the basis of five
 persons per square mile treaty money and various other benefits including education and assistance in times of need although the
 indians did not have a clear understanding of the meaning of the treaty they signed because of the fair treatment

 never locked his cabin when in the spring of 1 881 kerr was sent to ever he left it no

 killed 32 of the h b co grande prairie horses in one month at little red river when whiskey was
 contraband in the good old days when alberta was dry whiskey smugglers were sometimes caught with the goods when practicable
 the whiskey was usually brought into the post where it figured as exhibit a against the prisoners after having done
 duty as evidence the kegs were usually knocked in at the head and the contents under the direction of an
 officer poured out on the ground it frequently happened however that after one of these ceremonies the men seemed exceedingly
 jovial in fact their condition had they been in a country where intoxicants were procurable might have been ascribed to
 over indulgence the commanding officer in command of the post at lethbridge at one time noticed this peculiar fact and
 decided that he would personally superintend the destruction of a certain large seizure he would satisfy himself that orders were
 carried out in every detail they were yet when stables were sounded that night the sergeant major a seasoned veteran
 was the only one to appear and when he reported that all the men were laid out the feelings of
 the commanding officer may be imagined he went to the spot where the liquor had been poured and investigated the
 ground when he struck it with his stick rang hollow further investigation revealed to the astounded officer the fact that
 from the interior of a building close by a small tunnel had been burrowed beneath the place where the whiskey
 was spilled and receptacles placed so that they caught the precious fluid as it trickled through the thin covering above
 that night there was mourning in the land and from that time on the interest of many a man in
