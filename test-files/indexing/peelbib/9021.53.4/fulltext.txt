 aberhart used the air alexander rutherford 1905 10 arthur waves to try to convince albertans and the sifton 1910 17
 and charles stewart 1917 ufa government to adopt this radical 21 during its entire term the local parly system when

 most however were based upon and development in all parts of the globe a the control of money and as
 this was the leading point of contention in the 1 970 s was prerogative of the federal government his oil
 and gas revenue sharing between the legislation was declared ultra vires he did provincial and federal governments this succeed in
 producing prosperity certificates became confrontational in 1980 when the which were a form of money scrip and his federal government
 under prime minister ideas for a government bank resulted in the pierre trudeau introduced the national formation of the alberta
 treasury branches energy program to give his government but aberhart had no more success than control over both pricing and
 profit sharing anyone else in overcoming the depression of oil resources on one hand oil was being although he did
 vastly improve the sold below world prices and on the other the province s educational and health care federal government
 was taking an increasing systems control of oil and gas resources and share of the profits not until there was
 a the protection of farmers against foreclosure change of government in ottawa did the situation change following aberhart s death

 aside the social to diversify alberta s economy into such credit philosophies in favour of a well areas as the
 petrochemical industry managed government when he took office agricultural processing medical research the depression was over and he now became

 diversification with the discovery of taking over during a time of falling oil prices oil at leduc in 1947 the
 social credit and a severe recession the resulting collapse government found a workable balance of real estate prices shrinking capital
 between the demands of oil companies and investment and bank failures placed getty in the need to develop an energy
 industry for the an untenable situation as disaster piled upon benefit of the people this led the province disaster his
 leadership was being questioned into an unexcelled period of prosperity and public confidence in him however when manning retired in
 1968 it soon unjustified had an unsettling effect on the future of the party in 1991 he retired from became
 clear that it was his leadership and popularity that kept his party in power not politics and was replaced by
 former calgary the theories of social credit he was mayor ralph klein replaced by harry strom a reluctant leader where
 getty had been quiet and retiring who lacked the charisma needed for such a leader after a steady decline in

 institutions realizing this most earnestly the these schools but having experienced the present government of our young province kindness of
 the people and the wonderful has given the utmost attention to the matter of aptitude of the pupils this difficulty
 is also a common school system about past as an essential principle of government they in 36 districts the school
 board was elected in have provided generously for education in the usual canadian way most of these have various phases
 but first and most effectively english speaking secretaries who are very for the common schools with the rapid helpful to
 the school boards in administering expansion of settlement in the country it is a affairs in other cases the secretaries
 are difficult matter for the department of ruthenian and they are doing admirable education even with the generous sum at
 its work in twelve districts the department s disposal to meet the multiplicity of demands organizer of these schools has
 been asked to upon it settlers are pushing from every become an official trustee fulfilling all the direction and as
 soon as they can organize a duties of the usual board it is a work that school district they want

 now that the ruthenians have school district was one received at the been brought by actual results to see that
 the department from the west end of lesser slave benefits educational work among them is lake where some settled townships
 be over established on a solid basis 390 miles from a railway point the district was arranged for and it
 is likely this school this is but one instance though a striking one will open its classes this term of
 the conscientious way in which alberta s government is preparing all settlers in the as another instance there is the
 matter of province to take their share of the national life galician or ruthenian schools they consist and to work
 unitedly together in fulfilling the of 48 school districts organized in the past very bright destinies of this province three
 years under the direction of a man especially selected by the department for this the activity of this department is
 only in work he meets with sympathetic fulfilment of the policy declared by the comprehension all the early difficulties felt
 by liberals of alberta in 1905 when it was these new corners in understanding the canadian school system some of
 them resolved that the convention hereby although desirous of schools were afraid of declares its belief that the government of
 the system of school rates even when as usual the new province should maintain an arranged by themselves or their
 own school efficient system of common schools in board they felt they might in this way only order to meet
 the wants of the settler and put themselves again in the way of oppressive to extend to the children of
 the settler taxation such as they had fled from but as and to extend to the children of all they
 gradually came to understand the classes of the population an equal fairness of the canadian system this passed opportunity to
 obtain a good primary and many living outside of unorganized education that this system should districts now want to get
 in one receive liberal financial assistance from the government revenues and that all the they did not want in some
 instances to issue schools receiving such assistance and school debentures preferring to build a support by taxation should be subject
 in school of logs themselves but they have every particular to the direct and mostly changed their minds in this
 regard and continued supervision regulation and have in all now 27 good schools elected at an control by the provincial
 department of average cost of 900 in some places they education built additional rooms as a residence for the by
 this policy it was intended that the canadian teachers the latter fearing the supervision regulation and control of all loneliness
 of settlement where little english state aided schools should rest with the was spoken were at first reluctant to go

 of the good for the boys and girls of alberta and country making education so important a the standard through
 the system is factor in assimilating the fusing of the many correspondingly high races assembled here as well as to

 by john e brownlee as interviewed by una maclean evans editor ‘ s introduction john brownlee who served as alberta
 s premier from 1925 to 1934 was considered by many to be the province s most capable leader a highly
 intelligent administrator he maintained tight control over radical elements of his caucus and believed strongly in balanced budgets and responsible
 government brownlee was born in port ryerse ontario in 1883 attended the university of toronto and came west to calgary
 about 1908 he was elected to the alberta legislature in 1921 for the united farmers of alberta and became premier
 four years later in 1933 he became involved in a scandal resigned and lost his seat in 1935 when the
 social credit party came to power brownlee s later achievements were with the united grain growers and the alberta wheat
 pool in retrospect the negotiation to transfer alberta s natural resources fi om the federal government was his greatest achievement
 one that had a major impact on the growth of the province in the early 1960 s una maclean later
 una maclean evans researcher for the glenbow foundation conducted interviews with various members of the ufa those john e brownlee
 premier of alberta from 1925 to 1934 represented the united farmers of alberta alberta history autumn 2005 with premier brownlee
 took place between remaining resources and the general terms march 28 and may 12 1961 and are now in on
 which this would be done the dominion the glenbow archives file m 4079 appointed mr s b wood who used
 to be k c and formerly a barrister practising in edmonton but then in ottawa to work with representatives of
 the province in preparing maclean i think probably we should start an agreement setting out the transfer and the with
 the election of 1921 the return of general terms this agreement was the natural resources was something that all completed
 during the following year 1925 parties agreed to i don t think there was any but was not finally let
 me correct that this action taken during the first couple of years agreement was pretty well completed by perhaps as
 far as negotiations are concerned 1925 it was finally put into shape for signature on january 9 th 1926 brownlee
 i doubt if there were unfortunately i don t recall just when we did the agreement as then signed was
 quite start satisfactory but after the signing of the agreement a representative of the dominion maclean i do have a
 note here that during government came to edmonton and the 1923 session an act was passed urging suggested that there
 should be two or three upon the government of canada the modifications of it one modification being necessity for the
 transfer to the province of that to the section dealing with the transfer natural resources of school lands that there
 should be added a brownlee was that an act or a resolution paragraph requiring that the school lands fund together
 with any lands school lands maclean i have it down as an act but it subsequently transferred should be held
 by probably was a resolution i also have here the province and used in accordance with that you spoke on
 the 22 nd of may 1925 section 17 of the alberta act there was also and gave a history of
 the negotiations a suggested change dealing with parks and leading to the visit of a representative of the forest reserves
 i m bound to say that i saw federal government and then the question of no serious objection to the
 change and i still the money for school lands arose think that the discussion which subsequently took place was more
 a matter of semitiment brownlee the question of the transfer to and fear than actual danger the province of its
 natural resources was one which had engaged the interest of political however after the bill had been introduced in parties
 in the province even before the to the legislature to ratify the agreement the election of ‘ 21 and was
 one of the important question that did arise as to the effect of the questions confronting the government reference to
 section 17 of the alberta act as to shortly after that election there never was whether or not this in
 any way tied the any serious difference of opinion between question of the transfer of the school lands the parties
 and the house the question and the school lands fund to the question of pretty much resolved itself into one
 of first separate schools in the province when the persuading the dominion to return the bill was debated in the
 house in may i made undisposed of resources and secondly a statement somewhat as follows it is a settling the
 question of some kind of matter of deepest regret to me personally that financial consideration for resources which an interpretation
 has been placed on the had been disposed of by the dominion section dealing with the school lands which was
 never intended when the bill was being in 1923 the question came before the drafted or when it was discussed
 during the assembly when the resolution was passed committee stage when we were last together supported by all parties asking
 that negotiations be resumed with the dominion i then traced the history of the negotiations in an effort to get
 the request disposed of i and mentioned the visit of the representative do not remember in detail all of the
 of the federal government and because of the negotiations which then took place but i do rather wide discussion which
 had taken recall that during the year 1924 i visited place entered into further talks with mr ottawa and as
 a result of the conferences prime minister mackenzie king by then held general agreement was reached telephone he could not
 see that there was that the dominion would transfer the any particular difficulty and seemed anxious premier in action s

 en mid fur t hi prey n lily ownid riliwbyl premier brownlee was sketched by an edmonton journal artist while
 giving an address according to the artist he was drawn while informing the alberta legislature of the present status of
 various offers made for the provincially owned railways alberta history autumn 2005 that the agreement should go through with the
 additional clauses inserted as had been ‘ drafted i could not agree with his position and at another time made
 the statement that we were satisfied with the remaining terms of the agreement but i could not see that the
 w l mackenzie king canada s question of education or of the prime minister was premier administration of our schools
 including brownlee s adversary during separate schools should be tied in any way efforts to transfer natural with the transfer
 of the resources finally resources from federal when putting the act through the legislature government to the province the government
 chamiged the special clause brownhee tells of an angry by striking out the reference to section i 7 of confrontation
 between the two the alberta act and simply using the ssords men that the funds shocmld be used for the
 support of schools organized and carried on in accordance with the laws of the province unfortunately this difference of opinion
 as to the intent and meaning of the proposed bill did hold up the completion of the agreement as ratified
 by the legislature in 1926 and in due course we received a copy of mr further negotiations rested for a
 year or two crerar s report and upon careful study of it but they were renewed in 1927 and ‘
 28 we concluded that if the basis recommended by him for the transfer to the province of its in 1928
 i led a delegation of the alberta resources was accepted in relation to ministers to ottawa in a further effort
 to get manitoba then the same principle should this question settled and during that interview apply to the other provinces
 and if we the alberta delegates outlined in detail the looked at the alberta problem following the terms upon which
 they were prepared to take principles laid down by the crerar back the remaining natural resources we had commission alberta
 was entitled to very reconsidered the financial terms as embodied considerably more than we had suggested in the agreement of
 1926 and we did ask for when we were previously in ottawa and had some further consideration with respect to
 the made a definite offer and i have to admit alienated natural resources unfortunately we quite candidly my ministers and
 myself were could not reach agreement at that time i think confronted with a rather perplexing problem one of the
 reasons probably was that the same as to whether we should still stand by the question had arisen in relation
 to the offer which we had made on the previous provinces of saskatchewan and manitoba and year or whether we
 should now rest our case that the government had a plan in mind which on the manitoba terms and demand
 their they thought might facilitate solution of the application to alberta which would mean problem with respect to the three
 provinces better financial terms than were included in our offer we after considerable debate in any event the federal government
 came to the conclusion that alberta was appointed a royal commission under the entitled to the same treatment as manitoba
 chairmanship of the honorable t a crerar and we decided to take that position to consider the terms of the
 transfer of natural resources to the province of it was not long before we received a manitoba and while that
 commission was telegram from the prime minister mr king working there was no further discussion of inviting us to ottawa
 for the purpose of the subject with alberta in due course mr settling the natural resources question we crerar completed
 his inquiry at least his had no doubt that he looked upon the commission did and brought in a report
 meeting as pretty much of a formality and recommending the transfer to manitoba of was ready to settle upon the
 terms which we its resources and the terms upon which that had previously asked when we met in should be
 done the government accepted ottawa we received a very cordial welcome the report and proceeded to complete the from the
 cabinet and i asked that the transfer to manitoba on the terms question of the natural resources be recommended postponed
 for a few minutes as i wished to alberta history autumn 2005 raise the question of unemployment relief developed and
 without attempting to go intc which we could see was rapidly coming detail upon us and which as everyone knows
 became very serious by 1929 and ‘ 30 i m very happy to recall that by eleven o clock that
 evening the difficulties had all after about an hour of discussing that been ironed out and the terms of the
 subject we turned to the natural resources agreement fully completed with the result and on behalf of the alberta government
 i that a new agreement was then drafted which had to inform the prime minister mr king was submitted to
 the alberta legislature in we were not prepared to abide by the terms 1930 in the section dealing with the
 transfer we had offered on the previous visit but felt of school lands the woi ding of the act which
 that alberta was entitled to the same we had passed in ‘ 26 was accepted and there treatment as manitoba
 had received and on was no reference to the alberta act and the basis of the commission s recom with
 respect to the financial terms the mendations we were entitled to more money i m afraid mr king was rather
 sadly compromise finally reached certainly was a disappointed when we took that position he great improvement on what had previously
 seemed to be satisfactory to the province had said at the beginning of our interview that he had to leave
 early for lunch but if we didn t finish before we adjourned we d meet for example in the act
 which was in the afternoon he was very quiet while i introduced in 1926 besides the transfer of was setting
 out our present position and the alienated resources the province was to finally abruptly he got to his feet and
 told us get in half yearly payments the annual sum we d have to put our recommendations in of 562
 500 for a period of three years only writing and let him have them and we d get in the
 agreement which was completed in our reply in due course 1929 and approved in 1930 the province was given the
 sum of 562 500 each year until john e brownhee i asked him if that meant that the discussion the
 population of the province reached was over and he said yes the matter was 800 000 thereafter the grant to
 the province too big to be decided quickly with the was to be 750 000 until the population changed position
 you have taken put it in reached 1 200 000 and thereafter the writing and send it to me payment
 was to be 1 125 000 annually so it will be seen that notwithstanding the with that he left and
 i proceeded to leave the difficulties and misunderstandings that room by another door with my associate developed from a financial
 standpoint it thinking the conference was over however was fortunate that the negotiations were both the honorable charles stewart and
 the postponed because of the mis honorable mr dunning were very much understandings concerned about the turn which the negotiations
 had taken and i haven t any so far as i know as far as i can recall with doubt
 at all that what followed was largely the signing of that agreement and its due to dinning s intervention ratification
 by the legislature there was no in any event that afternoon i received a opposition to the bill in 1930
 we proceeded with the administrative work in completing telephone call from him that the prime the transfer that was carried
 out without minister wished to see me again i telephoned the prime minister and went over any unforeseen incident of
 any kind to see him he expressed regret for the turn everybody worked in the utmost good faith the meeting
 had taken and wanted to arrange to get the problem behind us and of course i a conference which subsequently
 was do not need to recall the fact that the arranged for that evening at laurier house settlement took place
 at a very opportune the result was that i personally went over to time before the real beginning of the
 oil laurier house in the evening and had dinner development in the province and it has been with the prime
 minister and mr dunning a source of tremendously large income for and after dinner we retired to the library and
 the province ever since opened up the whole subject again with a review of the negotiations to date and a
 now i think that is about all i can say unless candid appraisal of the difficulties which had you have
 some questions alberta history autumn 2005 maclean there was one question i had there was reference in the first agreement
 that was drawn in 1926 that referred to the cooking lake forest reserve that its devised minerals and fishing rights
 should be retained by the government of canada i wondered why that particular one was singled out or was that
 left in the final agreement brownlee my memory is not too clear about that particular incident but i feel quite
 certain that this is the explanation one of the questions which had to be very carefully considered by the two
 governments was the position of the national parks and in talking about the natiomial parks at first i think probably
 the forest reserves were also kept in mind with respect to the national parks the problem of constitutional jurisdiction came
 up some of them are located in ational parks mind the mines ap dminerals alberta the banff national park for
 in them shall continue to be administered by example and part of the jasper park there the dominion that the
 parliament of canada a great service to history was are communities there and we expected that should have exclusive legislative
 jurisdiction performed by glenbow those communities would develop now at overthe areas that any laws that the researcher una maclean
 when first it seemed that those communities dominion had already put in effect should she interviewed several ufa should remain
 under the jurisdiction of the continue and expecting that certain taxing headers in the 1960 s she is province in
 which case we would regulate laws passed by the province such as seen here interviewing richard the giving of leases
 and the collection of gasoline tax should apply to the people in gavin reid ufa premier from revenue and take
 care of some of the the area all other jurisdiction rested with 1934 to 1935 administration on the other hand
 we were the dominion i think that s the reason that very anxious to keep the dominion interested the cooking
 lake forest reserve was in the national parks they were mainly specially referred to in the first act and not
 located in the mountain districts where the carried forward in the second cost of building roads and general improvement would
 be very high and so the maclean well there was also a session on decision was finally reached that with
 the status of the indian reserves is there respect to the national parks the complete anything particular in that context
 they of jurisdiction would remain with the course were retained under the jurisdiction dominion with certain exceptions for of the
 government example i think i am right in saying we reserved the right to collect gasoline tax and brownlee yes
 indian reserves continued one or two small things like that to be vested in the dominion the whole comparatively small
 but for the most part question of the care and treatment in the responsibility for development of the canada in
 all the provinces is a matter for national parks was left to the dominion and the dominion with the responsibility
 for very willingly so by the province indians remaining with the dominion that we should not interfere in any way
 with now i think on the first draft of the those areas that were set aside as indian agreement the
 dominion suggested that the reserves cooking lake forest reserve should be classed with the national parks and any maclean was
 there some arrangement mines or minerals in it reserved for the that the province would add any additional dominion and
 because of its size we didn t lands to the indian reserves the raise any serious objection however before government
 of canada required it the agreement of 1929 and ‘ 30 was completed any references to the forest brownlee there
 is nothing in the reserves were dropped and the agreement agreement covering that that would be a finally passed contains
 three clauses 14 15 matter that might come up almost anytime and 16 which in brief provide that the between
 the dominion and one of the alberta history autumn 2005 alberta history autumn 2005 oh yes he said taking lis

 anxiety to know the facts meeting from an aberhart radio broadcast over is making them very irritable it would seem

 of social credit some public spirited men have suggested speaker there is an interesting story behind the that there is
 a desire on the part of the old script during the earl y weeks of the line politicians to postpone
 the provincial campaign the ufa was concerned about the election so that it will be closer to the rising popularity
 of social credit and federal election it is said that they have wanted ammunition to refute some of given up
 all hope of winning the provincial aberhart s claims as a result an office election but they do not wish
 anything to this poster advertised a secretary took down the aberhart broadcasts interfere with their success at the federal meeting
 in macleod six weeks in shorthand and then typed them up for contest we are patiently waiting for the before
 the 1935 election circulation to members of the ufa it didn t government to make some definite do the party
 any good but it left a valuable announcement it seems to us that if no record of the emergence of
 social credit pronouncement is made before the middle the script is among others in the glenbow of june it would
 be wisdom on our part to archives ml 157 begin organizing for the federal election whenever it may take place
 we would ask that all of our social credit berhart ladies and gentlemen groups therefore to discuss this matter very
 a the tension that is in the air at the carefully and let us know by the 10 th or
 12 th present moment is very great of june at the latest what their opinion is of indeed on every
 side people are asking the suggestion we want no confusion in the when is the election to be held will
 it be in matter however it is essential that we june or july or are they going to postpone it
 should be prepared for every emergency to the fall people on every side are chafing someone has suggested that our
 present staff under the unnecessary delay they think the of social credit speakers with the aid of the present government
 has outworn its splendid supporters that are already in the usefulness and that there is nothing to be three western
 provinces british columbia gained by prolonging its life many people saskatchewan and manitoba could in the are sure that there
 must be some ulterior space of six or eight weeks so swing public motive that would cause the government to
 opinion in the west that we might be able to postpose the election until the fall as a elect to
 the federal government a solid bloc matter of fact the real cause of the of western social credit i trust
 that this is impatience of the people is due to their clear to you all anxiety to have something done
 towards the introduction of social credit and the during the next week or two i want you to solution of
 their present difficulties the discuss at your group meetings the question people realize that it will take some time to
 of entering the federal field when you have get all things properly arranged before the come to a definite conclusion
 on the matter system can be started and be made to write out a letter telling us what you think
 function about it alberta history autumn 2005 i ani glad to announce to the other the whole of the production
 of the province constituencies of the province that calgary for the great majority of the citizens of the is gradually
 getting rounded up in splendid province suffer hardship and want in the shape ready for the election campaign we midst
 of plenty have a strong group of businessmen who are organizing the presidents of the various social credit establishes the
 philosophy that groups as their helpers so that before another each bona fide citizen of the province ot week or
 two will be over everything will be alberta has an inherent right because of in shipshape i would suggest that
 each of residence and co operation with each other the other constituencies also get busy on the to a small
 share at least in whatever is question of organization for the vote taking produced from the natural resources of this
 the directors should get very busy together province we are convinced that no sane and separately securing proper scrutineers whole
 souled reasonable person except and men who will be able to help on the day through ungodly selfishness could maintaimi
 of the election this is most essential and that the bona fide citizens of this province should be attended to
 at your earliest should suffer want and privation the midst of opportunity abundance the whole problem therefore premier william aberhart
 boils down to this we must discover the this broadcast is sponsored by three scientific means by which these goods
 and splendid groups in calgary the oldest of services of our country may be distributed to these groups is the
 victoria no i this the best advantage of everyone just let me group has been operating in calgary from say
 to those who are hesitating in the matter the very first of the formation of groups and of social credit
 please do not hold back i am sure that much valuable work has been with questions how is he going
 to do this done through its operation the second how will he be able to do that use the first
 group sponsoring this broadcast is the personal pronoun plural we for i assure central group in calgary this is one
 of the you that if i have anything to do with this largest groups we have in the city the
 matter i shall seek the co operation of every members are very aggressive and i believe person whose imitelhigence will
 be are turning many towards the social credit worthwhile in the establishment of this new concepts social order i should
 like to say hello to the central you may be expected to be called upon to group tonight and all
 their friends as sume i issingi i should like to assembled in the al azhar temple to enjoy emphasize this
 fact as definitely as i know an interesting concert hello everybody we how for there are still those who are
 in our are thinking of you at this time and we are province who imagine that it is the intention
 hoping you are having a good time to set up some sort of dictatorship which will confiscate or override the
 rights of many of the third group sponsoring this broadcast is our citizens this is as far from the truth
 as it on the north hill on the brow of the hill could possibly be all good social creditors they
 call themselves the rosedale social seek the greatest cooperation possible from credit group while they are not so large in
 every source available numbers nevertheless in imiterest and intensity they are not lacking this is shown sometimes we have had
 questions put to us by their ability to sponsor a broadcast on will not the introduction of social credit your
 behalf therefore i wish to thank the interfere with and displace the regular banks several groups for sponsoring this broadcast
 that we have today my general answer to we hope for their sakes that it will this question has usually
 been that will accomplish some good depend largely upon the attitude of the banks if the banks wish to co
 operate and last week i called your attention to the assist us in every way possible to end unassailable foundation
 plank of social poverty in the midst of plenty if they will credit this plank is contained in the two
 assist in the conduct of our export business words cultural heritage the claim that no we shall seek in every
 way to co operate individual or groups of individuals nor the with them if on the other hand fifty big
 shots of canada have any right to missimig endeavour to feed clothe seize confiscate exploit or otherwise secure and shelter
 our hona tide citizens then d alberta history autumn 2005 unfortunately we will have to go along without them it
 is not our intention to throw 5 i m c 01 tiin t r 0 v ce t p a
 1 hicwfa own e gaun e o any group or sec ion o our citizens we seekthe greatest cooperation possible
 in fact ladies and da te o i 3 su s gentlemen although it is being forced upon augus r
 ti i 93 c t f 1 our attention that the day of the old line party politics is about
 over it s our considered ji i f p ‘ opinion thatif a social credit government is elected or if
 it does not secure sufficient majority to rule we would favour in esthem d case of the gmeatest co operation
 possible ‘ ‘ this present distress i wonder what more one could do than that • of course you will
 not misunderstand me thing which does not exist in reality but silly although social credit could not that there can
 be no compromise upon the in relationship between individuals a man introduce its monetary theories one great purpose that it
 is our intention to goes into a grocery store to buy goods it did produce a prosperity follow we are
 determined to give our without paying for them the grocer gives certificate which when filled citizens the right to live
 and let live we are him credit because he is satisfied with the with stamps on the back would definitely
 convinced that no citizen should man s ability to pay and will pay in the be worth a dollar it
 never be asked in the land of plenty like alberta is future it would be taken for granted that the
 achieved success to suffer privation and want of the bare man does not have currency or gold behind necessities of
 food clothing and shelter we his credit or he would not need to vouch for feel that every intelligent and
 godfearing it man and woman in this great province of ours is willing to admit that no one man or
 when i go to the bank it is somewhat group of men should be able to so control the different
 and yet it is similar the banker productions of the wealth of our natural does not give me goods when
 he gives me resources that our bona fide citizens should credit he simply gives me the right to use be
 in distress or want the bank s name on a cheque so when i get the goods i shall owe
 the banker not the manning mr aberhart you explained last grocer and i shall pay interest to the banker week
 the method by which a share in the for this unreal thing called credit in that cultural heritage of our
 province would be case the grocer does not depend on my made operative by the distribution of ability or integrity
 he depends upon the monthly basic dividends issued in the form of ability and integrity of the bank credit entered
 in the pass book from month to month there are still a number of people of course you know that
 the banker is cold who cannot get it out of their heads that the and calculating he is not going
 to take any issuance of this credit of a little over 10 000 chances of becoming involved through your a
 month would require as a basis or or my integrity or lack of integrity so he background that amount of
 currency or gold may require us to deposit with him that which represents the credit of another it aberhart yes
 manning i know i have met may be dominion or provincial bonds which them on every side they do not
 seem to are guaranteed by the country s credit or it realize that credit ultimately falls back on may be
 goods in the form of warehouse the integrity of some men or group of men receipts which will involve the
 credit of associated together another manning i think you should try to make the point we want to make is
 that all credit that a little plainer to them tonight so that is based not on real or material things
 but on their minds may be free from this false abstract or virtuous qualities of character notion involved in certain
 relationships which qualities inspire confidence or trust one in aberhart well i ll try to do that to begin the
 other now bear in mind that the with let me say that credit is that material province itself with all
 its wealth of natural alberta history autumn 2005 resources is standing behind the issuance of of alberta are getting wise
 to the these basic dividends it is surely evident inconsistencies and misrepresentations of therefore that the basic dividends of credit
 those who are opposing the introduction of need not have any gold or currency behind social credit them the whole
 natural resources of the country stand behind these just as truly as aberhart yes i believe so for the most
 they do behind the bonds issued by the part they are i think mr herbert c boyd province ma ll
 d of edgerton very properly stated this in a open letter to the ex premier manning is that the reason
 why the non brownlee he writes after reading the negotiable certificates pass freely between newspaper report of your address on
 april the citizens of the province without any 10 th and after hearing your examination of question or hesitation the
 university professor before the ç 0:c agricultural committee of the legislature 1 aberhart yes that is it exactly manning on the
 12 th i have been puzzled as to your the value of credit instruments is based objectives a year ago
 the government at during its first annual upon the person or persons that stand behind which you were then the
 head had major celebrations in 1936 social the instrument these non negotiable douglas and other witnesses under credit used this
 image on its certificates would be guaranteed by the examination with a view to exploring the program and included this
 province of alberta hence every citizen possibilities of putting social credit into inflammatory text to attack should be ready and
 willing to accept the operation in alberta now mr reid with bankers financiers and money same for goods knowing that
 he may concurrence of his supporters has invited lenders deposit the certificates and receive credit major douglas and mr aberhart
 to attend upon which he can draw at any time with full before the legislature for the very same for
 years the producers have permission of the state or province and purpose but from the argument on your been exploited
 of the products thereby be able to purchase or secure that radio address and other speeches and also of their
 labors by those who which he needs from the whole tenor of the question from hold the money monopoly of
 the government side of the house and the country by manipulation of manning did you ever notice that most of
 particularly yours i judge that the market prices by high interest the men who are writing articles against government seemingly
 led by yourself are charges by forced sales and social credit have not yet differentiated not so much anxious to
 see social credit foreclosures and by many other schemes the money changers between money and these non negotiable operate in
 alberta as to have it established have gained access to the certificates they seem to think that the that the
 operation of any such scheme cabbages province intends to issue a new kind of whether that of mr aberhart or
 major currency they forget that the use of the douglas is impossible under our what is the honest respectable non
 negotiable certificate is more or less on constitution if that is their attitude what is man to do if he
 uses his par with the use of bank cheques as not the purpose of bringing major douglas shovel to kill
 the voracious here insatiable creatures he will also aberhart yes that is the very point that destroy the cabbages if
 he tries shuts out all their arguments against it how manning mr boyd also took mr brownlee to poison them
 he thereby can their conclusions be correct if their upon the constitutional part of the case did leaves the product
 unfit for his hypotheses are inaccurate these non he not own use negotiable certificates are non negotiable he must destroy
 the germ that is they cannot be passed freely from boyd letter continues in your radio from which they hatch
 the new one person to another they are only valid as address you say that such a plan could only
 social order requires the between the debtor and the creditor hence be enacted by a sovereign state having ultimate elimination
 of the they are not scrip neither can they be complete control over finance amid of major interest racket the
 money considered money in any shape or form financial institutions your examination of changers must be removed nevertheless they have
 the whole natural the bna act leads you to conclude that a from the field of co operating resources of
 the country behind their issue provincial legislature is nothing but a christianity and men and women will certainly receive it
 glorified county council without any power in exchange for good and services i feel to make any wide m eforms
 in our financial or certain that the people of alberta will reject economic system that is not my these falsities
 on the part of our opponents interpretation of the present trend of the and will not give heed to any
 of their privy council cases as embodied in the four arguments that follow thereafter propositions laid down of the attorney
 general for canada vs attorney general for manning do you not think that the people british columbia 1930 act 118
 d alberta history autumn 2005 and i would remind you continues mr aberhart now read the reply given by mr
 boyd that mr justice riddel in the foreign hoadley mining company case held that within its own sphere the provincial
 legislature was manning that is a question which major completely sovereign douglas must answer and he hasn t done it
 yet the question has never been considered this is the quotation that mr boyd gives by the government in quite
 that way and i from the judge s decision the legislature would say that certainly this government within its jurisdiction
 can do anything that is would not entertain it and major douglas not naturally impossible and is restrained by would
 be foolish to propose it no rules human or divine hence it seems clear that in the sphere of alberta
 s credit aberhart hon mr hoadley could perhaps she is sovereign she has the power to have answered the citizen
 s reporter s borrow on it but she need not do so she question by simply suggesting that alberta may
 monetize her credit and issue it directly may be found to have sovereign power over without borrowing and in doing
 so she credit with secession the talk of secession would in no way infringe on canada s is entirely foreign
 under social credit now jurisdiction over the currency coinage and read the rest of the interview and the rest of
 legal tender this is precisely what the the final statement of mr hoadley advocates of social credit propose to do
 thus the letter from mr boyd exposed manning continues with hoadley the inaccuracy of the claims of quotationi what we
 have to determine is if unconstitutionality it will work how it will work and whether or not it will be
 destructive to the general manning how can you explain the fact that interests of the people that remains to be
 though you have declared this on numerous seen occasions though you are aware of the fact that these men have
 heard your declaration aberhart now i am convinced that the they still persist of talking of social credit general public
 will not take the decision of non negotiable cem tifmcates as a kind of scrip mr hoadley and the rest
 of the present government on these questions they will be william aberhart right and aberhart i may say manning that
 my faith more likely to pay more attention to what ernest manning seen here in in humanity has been somewhat
 shattered major douglas says andwhat to any of the 1936 were the two principals my father used to say that
 you could lead a present government will say especially figures in the radio broadcasts horse to water but you cannot
 make him when they remember that from the very first that brought social credit to drink i am persuaded that
 some men will there has been antagonism towards the power in 1943 manning not accep t an explanation because they
 do introduction of a social credit system became alberta s premier not want to accept it it seems to their
 advantage still to maintain the old chestnut they would have nothing to say against it if they admitted this fact
 they forget however their listeners are detecting the subterfuge and all their arguments are discounted thereby maiming what will they
 be able to say when major doumglas interim report is made public aberhart the ottawa evening citizen reporter published an
 interview with george hoadley friday may 17 th 1935 here it is you better read the reporter s question manning
 as it would seem that a prerequisite of the douglas plan is that it apply to a sovereign group how
 is alberta proposing to do anything along the line of e r social credit without succession alberta history autumn 2005
 manning yes and all the time they were that counts you will have to return to objecting they have made
 not made a single alberta however to cast your ballot suggestion by which the present extreme depi ession could be
 alleviated now ladies and gentlemen i want to thank once more on your behalf the central social aberhart you are
 right and what is more credit group of calgary and also victoria they are wondering why it is that the
 people no 1 and rosedale groups all of calgary are not going to return them to office even though they
 have no constructive who have sponsored this broadcast tonight i propositions to make am sure they are delighted to hear
 from time to time how the people are gradually manning have you any announcements to comprehending the fundanmental principles niake
 of social credit and are giving their very best support to it for their information i manning yes the following
 qrmestions would like to say that there is hardly a day might be cleared up over the air this evening
 passes but that i speak with or hear of if possible no i unemployed married men business men who have
 not taken a very who are accepting government jobs on government highways are anxious to know proimminent attitude to social
 cm edit in the any voting arrangements will be made for immatter of supporting it but who are them on
 election day aberhart we know of thoroughly commvinced that it is a remedy none so far deserving of their whole
 heai ted support manning no 2 will there be polling bidding you good night i would like to opportunities at
 the relief camps where the remind you that shakespeare was right single men are stationed aberhart we omice to every
 man a nation comes a have no information along these lines so far moment to decide manning no 3 men
 who are tenmporarily out of the province travelling or working for it is high time that each one of us
 made up his mind definitely regarding this great a considerable length of time wish to know if they can retain
 their residence in alberta solution for your presemit problem have you for voting ie if they have not established made
 up your mind to support social credit residence in any other province by voting there is no other solution offered
 it is this there aberhart it is the place of residence or none i am sure you will see the
 point alberta history autumn 2005 ottawas national energy progi 1 an address by peter lougheed eclitor ‘ s introduction late
 in 1980 time t ederal government introduced the commtroversial national energy pi ogrammi in a move to gain control over
 revenues from alberta s oil and gas resources throumgh federal taxes amid pricing structumm es in tlmis address to the
 calgary chamber of commimimerce on february 13 1981 premier lougheed explains the implicmitions of the federal move and the disastrous
 effects it could have on canada s economy on time following day the calgary j jei ald described the speech
 as a hardhitting anmmlysis of the impact of the federal energy policy while the globe and mail called it an
 emmmotional call for albertans to increase their opposition to ottawa s unilateral energy price setting and federal taxation progrmmni peter
 lougheed was born in calgary in 1928 and received a law degree from the university of alberta in 1952 durimmg
 his university years he was a noted athlete and also was halfback for the edmonton eskimos after his graduation he
 went to harvard where he received an mba and on his return to alberta he was called to the bar
 and joined the construction firm of mannix corporation in 1965 he was elected leader of the alberta progressive conservative party
 and was leader of the opposition from 1967 to 1971 he then led his party to victory at the polls
 and served as premier for the next fourteen years during his tenure he established the heritage savings trust fund introduced
 the alberta bill of rights affirmed provincial rights during the patriation of canada s constitution and encouraged economic diversification peter
 lougheed premier of alberta from 1971 to 1985 the following speech is contained in the lougheed papers at the lougheed
 house in calgary r chairman head table guests mfellow calgarians and albertans first of all i would like to say
 how much i appreciate this opportunity to communicate with you omm some extremely important provincial and national issues i would
 like to say to the calgary chamber of commerce how pleased i am with the progress of your organization congratulate
 your current executive and wish your new executive to be elected at your upcoming ammnual meeting the very best in
 their year obviously this chamber has become even more significant as a focal point both for this exciting and dynamic
 comimmunity and as a form for business opinion throughout canada it is clear that the increased alberta history autumn 2005
 involvement and participation by the i would like to move now to the ottawa business community in the chamber energy
 program what is the real objective working with the alberta chamber is it is not an overstatement to say that
 the continuing to have an ever larger degree of basic objective of the federal energy influence on business issues throughout
 the proposal of october 28 th 1980 is an country that was evident by the efforts of attempt to take
 over the resource ownership the chamber on the crucial energy questions rights of this province and others in due at
 the annual meeting of the canadian course the taxing and pricing powers of the chamber in quebec last fall federal
 government have been used in a clearly discriminatory way primarily my purpose today is to primarily review the directed at
 two million albertans and to a energy scene i have not spoken in calgary lesser extent at citizens in british
 columbia on this crucial issue since october 30 th and saskatchewan unparalleled in our 1980 some three and a half
 months ago i history think it is important for mime to outline the consequences of the ottawa energy program the
 essential word to describe these and update you and the citizens of alberta proposals is unfair they basically change on
 developments as seen from our the rules of confederation they change the perspective it is important to continue rules in
 terms of resource ownership rights communication with albertans on this issue of the provinces you and i and others ask
 a i hope that you will respond to my remarks fair question could this conflict have been so that we
 can in fact have a dialogue avoided 7 i have concluded without question that the answer is no if the
 basic before moving to the energy issue 1 want to objective of the ottawa government is take refer to the
 important question of the canadian over they cannot be really interested in constitution i believe most of you are well
 negotiations they are prepared to go as far aware that the constitutional proposals of the as they think they can
 push they have ottawa government are interrelated to the counted on albertans either capitulating energy resource matters i believe that
 you are through loss of support because of the also well aware that the amending formula damage to a basic
 industry or by the alberta proposed in the ottawa position would allow a government over reacting to pernmit them further
 dilution of the resource rights of acceptability in other parts of canada by alberta and other provinces also you will
 be way of legal take over under emergency aware that the proposals from the powers ottawa indicated to us last
 summer parliamentary committee in ottawa to the that they were not really interested in federal house of commons and senate
 with negotiating differences the details of our regard to resources are insignificant for position on this were well expressed by
 the alberta particularly with regard to indirect hon merv leitch alberta minister of taxation because of the small freehold position
 energy natural resources in a of our resources even more important the legislative assembly report recorded in advice we are
 receiving on the wording of hansard on november 3 rd 1980 resources rather than strengthening the ownership rights of the
 provinces will in fact let me trace the negotiating history of the weaken them by judicial interpretation current situation we
 had an agreement on thereafter pricing which concluded on december 3 1 st 1979 which was extended for six months
 at this time i sadly make this observation i hence it was clear that we had to negotiate thought we
 were involved in these constant a new agreement with the clark constitutional meetings with one basic administration during 1979 it
 has to be a objective to unify this country in my negotiative process between the provinces judgement and i believe
 the judgement of owning the resources and the federal many others the result particularly of the government who have control
 of process being undertaken by the ottawa interprovincial and international trade and government is exactly the opposite rather commerce than
 bringing this country together sadly i think it will further divide us to impose or the 1979 negotiations were difficult
 because attempt to impose a constitution upon a the senior officials of the federal department federal state such as canada
 with the majority of energy mines resources essentially of provinces and people in the regions wanted to nationalize this basic
 private sector opposed will produce disunity and bitterness industry the only progress we were able to in canada at a
 time crucial in our history make during 1979 was when we were able to alberta history autumn 2005 move beyond
 the official level the arrangement of december 1979 was fair to alberta and good for the country as a whole
 when we faced the new negotiations of 1980 we started with the position that we would not accept less than
 the same net benefits as negotiated with the clark administration when i met with the prime minister on july 25
 th 1980 in ottawa we decided that we ii must take some important immeasures to avoid a serious confrontation we
 compromised in a significant way well beyond what some of my colleagues wished us to do we took the position
 that we would not seek world prices nor seek 85 per cent of world prices but accept a major and
 significant discount of 75 per cent for our rapidly depletimmg oil staged in over a four year period amid based
 on the north american price with natural gas we would ‘ do even immore with incentives for conversion and transportation
 paid for out of the alberta treasury we felt it was important august and september the storm came on premier
 lougheed is seen here that total canadian potential requirement for october 28 th 1980 with even more speaking to the
 party faithful in natural gas was fully realized extremity than we had anticipated 1982 during the nep dispute with ottawa
 in addition as part of that proposal we were before going on i think it is important to prepared to
 make very large and substantive step back and trace some history before commitments to oil sands accelerated assessing the consequences
 and the development 7 bilhiomm from the funds of implications of the federal moves of october the people of alberta
 for debt and equity 28 th 1980 first of all i believe that it is also we proposed a commitment
 to a important to emphasise that the petroleum permanent infrastructure and work force for industry developed without significant help accelerated
 development of the oil sands from the federal government or the together with a significantly lower royalty government of ontario
 a myth has than we had in the syncrude agreement abounded in this country that in the 1960 s the
 ontario government did us a great favour there were a number of other commitments by buying our oil at more
 expensive prices made in the interest of settling this matter to than could be purchased elsewhere improve canadian oil supply
 in order to reach a goal of canadian energy self we have studied this situation and if a sufficiency our
 july 25 th 1980 offer was in quality comparison is made it simply isn t my judgement and the judgement
 of many true even if it had been then surely in the others clearly good for canada and fair to
 judgement of the people in the ontario alberta it contained some important key government at that time made the decision
 conditions what were they that the based on the benefits derived by the people petroleum industry centred in our province
 of ontario in having a secure source of not be subject to punitive taxation certainly supply which should have over
 ridden any not subject to a natural gas export tax or a question of a nominal difference in price in
 wellhead tax on gas or oil but most any event the facts are different from the important not subject to
 punitive taxation myth that myth needs to be punctured by thereby reducing activity all of us because it is being
 used in a significant way this proposal of july 25 th 1980 made on behalf of the people of this
 province was as the next thing i want to say about historical you know flatly rejected there was no relationships
 is that the taxes of the federal counter offer we knew after that meeting government during the period of the
 1960 s that ottawa had no intention of negotiating and early 1970 s discriminated against the difference and we warned
 albertans of canadian ownership explorers had to seek an upcoming storm during the months of their support elsewhere their cash
 elsewhere alberta history autumn 2005 it was only in the 1970 s that a belated discoveries major new gas fields
 and a recognition was made by the federal higher degree of effort to increase the governmemmt to adjust the tax
 situation creating recovery from our existing production let us drilling funds to give the tax incentives and to pause and
 ask the question what was the place canadians in a comparable position the situation last summer in the summer of
 result of course was the start of very 1980 for the canadian energy oil and gas in significant canadian participation
 in the particular we had strong and viable canadian oil and gas industry petroleum industry prepared on all fronts to
 accept and meet the challenges of energy let us go back to the early 1970 s when the self sufficiency
 in canada in the 1980 s alberta governmmment newly elected as the updated rig fleet world renowned technical owner worked
 out a satisfactory skill and capacity in denmand as mammy in this relationship with the industry as explorer room know
 in other parts of the world and and producer this was not done without planning of nuimmerous enhanced oil recovery

 we had massive risk funds for exploration and this relationship the watchword was development in the western sedementary consistency and

 autumn 2005 proviumcial lands an approach in the name of 1 t ‘ canadianization which will result in significant ‘
 nationalization ‘ these are the main features of the october 28 th 1980 energy program of the ottawa ‘ government
 the description i have for this program not overstated is a recipe for econoimmic disaster for canada in the l
 980 s 1 l is wwat e e t others have described it in their own terms ‘ i ri
 i believe it will be an economic disaster ‘ i want to move next to the motives involved ‘ one
 of the motives i don t think i am ‘ ‘ overstating it is that a summall select group in
 ottawa wants to nationalize aim industry so ‘ ‘ they can fully control it they have no seats ‘ to
 lose in this part of the country no i j chrysler no massey ferguson immanufacturing in the west we book
 at the j f ‘ i automobile industry talk about foreign i ‘‘ investment look at the petroleum industry they
 are already very heavily regulated and sovereignty is protected by resource ownership rights of the province it is control in
 ottawa not canadianization that state where any decision of substance is in this innes cartoon in the is the motive
 it is an obvious simmokescreen made in ottawa they recognize they have to calgary herald november 29 to say that
 it is canadianization cater to ontario and quebec to stay in office 1980 primer ministertrudeau but this select group cannot
 accept any other and energy minister lalonde it is fashionable in parts of this country to province becomimmg nmoderately independent
 are seen robbing the bank of attack niultinational corporations who we and not subservient to theumi for federal alberta invited
 into this country it ignores the discretionary grants history the coumtribution and the potential for research and development it is
 serious in well it must be something to hear the terms of jobs for canadiaim oil and gas discussions in
 ottawa they must say that companies it seems that they care not a whit upstart province will never do imagine
 it in some parts of ottawa about jobs in this could get out of control it might not be just
 part of canada we look at the treatment of a alberta it might then be british columbia company like chrysler
 the different way in what about those people in newfoundland which they are treated is a disturbing sign of they
 are showing the same disturbing discrimimination in the extreme to me tendencies we had better stop it before it gets
 out of hand we had better club themim i am trying to control my eummotions into submission and october 28
 th 1980 was the date they chose i favour canadianization but not ottawa s way incentives to canadians yes but
 not sommme of you may say this is harshly put but penalties to those who are already here we these
 in my judgement are the true motives were in fact doing something about of what the october 28 th federal
 proposals increasing significantly the canadian are all about it is naive for us not to see ownership of the oil
 and gas industry i think through them and be aware of them we are entitled to see statements by some
 political headers as i am trying to do today we have responded in a number of ways recognizing the employment
 situation of with the prime objective to force the ottawa many working for so called multinational government to reconsider their
 energy firms in addition to the canadian ones who program to make them realize they cannot have been involved for
 so many years and have oil self sufficiency in canada without whose jobs are being threatened by this so co
 operation without working with the called program of ‘ canadianization major provincial producing provinces such as alberta to make them
 realize that the i think the second motive is about control discrimination is causing bitter divisions in what kind of
 a canada do they want in our country to make them realize that the ottawa i believe they really want
 a unitary alberta government has significant support alberta history autumn 2005 from the people of this province in standing where
 there is a reasonable possibility of a up for their rights reconsideration of the federal proposals our first approach was
 to cut back our the second action that we took refers to oil conventional crude oil which will start on
 sands plants we are not prepared to sacrifice existing jobs in the conventional oil and gas march 1 st 1981
 why to balance the industry for new jobs in oil sands plants if federal unilateral move to control prices re
 ottawa wants alberta s co operation on oil establishing our ownership jurisdiction to supply they must be fair to us
 and to our control the rate of production by leaving a citizens with our existing conventional fair portion of a
 rapidly depleting industry and reserves this approach has conventional oil reserve in the ground in gained the support of albertans
 since practical terms this will enhance its value october 30 th even more than i had hoped and not affect
 jobs in alberta except in a and we will respond as i have stated on minor way other occasions to
 the concerns of the communities adversely affected by our it appears since my telecast on october decision 30 th 1980
 this approach has received there is a third part of our response it overwhelming acceptance by albertans involves everybody here
 we must try to ottawa is able to buy replacement oil in convince other canadians of the folly of fact
 it seems to me and perhaps to you that ottawa s energy moves in co operation with they prefer to
 buy it from mexico rather than the industry and with citizen groups i really alberta the prime minister finds it
 in the do think we have made considerable canadian interest not to negotiate with progress in the three and a
 half months that alberta for 17 to 18 a barrel but to buy have ensued the alberta government has the
 dispute arising out of the from saudi arabia at 40 per barrel that by been joined by british columbia amid
 nep ma depicted in this cartoon the way is a message that is penetrating very saskatchewan in a statement by
 all three as a high stakes gambling energy producing provinces that is very game with energy minister effectively in other
 parts of canada some i strong we have fully utilized a immultitude of lalonde left and premier think have underestimated
 the significance communication channels over that period lougheed right holding all the of this decision it is unprecedented in and
 will continue in the months ahead with chips while the poor citizen is canada the cutback in production will the
 same resolve caught in the middle with only amount to 180 000 barrels of oil per day one chip this
 cartoon by innes plus or 15 per cent of our conventional oil in the petroleum industry in these past three
 appeared in the calgary herald three stages it is crucial in endeavouring to and a half months have in my
 judgement mr january 27 1981 create an atmosphere leitch sjudgement and many others done an excellent job in public communication
 of the basic data and consequences many groups have been involved the independent petroleum association of canada is to do
 an assessment on the canadian conmpanies the canadian association of oilwell drilling companies with their casualty reports the canadian petroleum
 association with their i i 1 j evaluation of supply for the future the new ii uii ii l iy
 l l lll itti energy services association of canadian companies who have been ummost seriously damaged in the service area
 and many other industry groups as well as many citizen groups including the chambers of comummerce ‘ what has been
 the result frankly i think the result has been a consistent course of views by canada wide orgammizations condemning ottawa
 s approach and recommending constructive approaches to canadian energy and economic progress i i i ‘ i don t have
 time to enunmerate but let me deal with the last two yesterday in ottawa six alberta history autumn 2005 in

 eslnieimi alberta history autumn 2005 prey upon companies least able aimd prepared in addition to this the ottawa program will
 be damaging to canada s economic vitality and future firstly because canada will become increasingly more dependemmt upon insecure supplies
 of oil from uumstable regions of the world the recent submissioum to withstand the pressures that are involved to the
 national energy board confirms this self sufflcie conclusion as additional evidence the 9 o cancellation of enhanced recovery projects like
 judy creek as well as the cancellation of expansion to existing oil sands plants energy among the 24 oecd countries
 of the secondly the artificial low prices for canadian energy will continue to assure that canada is the largest per
 capita consumer of western developed world there is no prior to the national energy ‘ funds in serious proportions to
 the united shown the folly of that approach encouragement for conservation in this policy and the united states experience has
 program canada had hopes of states that is the only element of their becoming self sufficient in oil by ottawa
 strategy that is working so far returning to the canadian economy overall 1990 the calgary herald on it will stagnate
 the economic boom in may 8 1982 shows what happed the consequences are obviously serious for western canada as the
 energy projects are to the plan canada it means that the rigs the people delayed the economic council of canada
 and the funds have to in fact go before the and many others have pointed this out the ottawa government
 realizes it has gone benefits that have been seen in other parts of overboard and damaged seriously a key canada
 from a booming west will no longer industry what a tragedy for our country be there finally it has ignored
 or not understood a key canadian industry the what are the consequences of ottawa s natural gas industry with an
 export energy program i would like to briefly potential for british columbia and alberta review them as stated before compammy
 which has been declared can you imagine after company canadian owned and by the ottawa government to be otherwise will
 reduce exploration activity redundant truly unbelievable significantly in canada some estimates put industry wide cutbacks from pre october i wanted
 to go into detail today on this 28 th planned exploration budgets at 35 per subject but the overview i
 felt was necessary i therefore wish to develop the whole cent or 2 billion in reduced cash flow with question
 of a sound natural gas policy for discouragement being the prime reasons canada including pricing and marketing on the impact
 is particularly hard or canadian another occasion owned drilling and oilwell servicing companies threatening jobs and viability it is incredible
 to go through this it is hard to reducing purchase orders in ontario quebec believe i said in edmonton in
 november that and manitoba by manufacturers and these proposals and i used a word that some suppliers thought was too
 strong i am afraid i cannot come up with another word i consider the next that the cutback causes a
 drain from whole concept of october 28 th stupid canada of talent and entrepreneurship to the united states very difficult
 to encourage let me conclude this way i stated in back next that it involves expropriation of november that the
 alberta government funds from alberta oil and gas production by would shift to a series of new policy ottawa greater
 than the funds received by initiatives to assure the general economy of the owner of the resource it will damage
 the our province at least to remain strong i will canadian owned segment of a crucial elaborate on the progress
 we have been canadian industry which has been growing making at a later date at this time this and it
 will allow petrocan in my view to february 13 th there has been no indication alberta history autumn 2005 from
 ottawa that they are prepared to ‘ ‘ significantly restructure their pricing and taxing provisions we are in i think
 for a ‘ s long haul as mentioned it seems tragic but i ‘ we may have to prove that
 these statements i s ‘ i p i are not just crying wolf but are in fact going ‘ ‘
 k ‘ 5 to occur ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ l what about each of you as individuals or ‘ ‘
 ‘ i ‘ i representatives of organizations what can be done can you get involved many of ‘ ‘ l
 f 3 you have asked that it has got to be ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ frustrating it is to me
 too but ottawa hopes ‘ you are going to give up ottawa hopes you ‘ are going to get discouraged
 and say what s the use and then take the pressure off theni • i am not going to give
 up neither are my colleagues so i say to you don t please ‘ sure it is tough sledding but
 it has to be done the awareness in central canada of ‘‘ these issues has to penetrate i think we
 have ‘ had great success in an awareness at the management level in central canada the fairness must remain where
 ever you live the calgary herald march 20 next step are the employees of those and whatever the colour of
 your political 1981 accused the federal concerns whose long term security is map a canada which grasps its incredible government
 of being so jeopardized opportunities to make its resource potential preoccupied with the nep and combined with its skilled private
 enterprise the patriation of canada s i suggest you ask your associates in business into an economy that provides quality
 and constitution that it was for a chance to talk to their employees not security for our citizens both today
 and in ignoring the dangers of just to meet with them in the boardrooms to the future a vision of
 canada where the inflation a major recession move the discussions to all the people that philosophy that hard work pays
 is true to struck the country a short time are involved to keep up the risk our savings and to
 rely upon our later communications and improve the personal initiatives is in the end a vision of understanding canada that
 is in the best interests of all it can be done we can weather this storm and finally i know
 it is a very difficult time for no small elite in ottawa can stop us for long you and me
 in alberta we will be even more that is my vision for a positive canada extensively and personally insulted and
 attacked by our opponents our love of our thank you very nmuch country as we understand canada to be will
 continue to be unfairly questioned by some our accomplishments in this part of canada will be belittled and ignored and
 we will be editor s afternote premier lougheed s under intense pressure to capitulate to prediction of difficult times ahead
 proved to surrender our rights and our control over our be true in 1982 alberta slipped into a deep destiny
 it will be difficult it will hurt and recession which was blammied on the national some will bleed but i
 am confident that energy program and plunging international albertans are up to the test and will weather oil prices there
 were thousands of layoffs the storm unemployment rose to 15 per cent and for the first time in history calgary
 experienced i want to close this way let us look ahead a decrease in population support industries difficult as the
 times are i see a different such as drilling construction work and vision of canada than this small select group
 housing also suffered severe setbacks on in ottawa a much different vision a vision november 2 1982 lougheed s of
 a nation where harmony stems from conservatives were reelected taking 75 of prosperity in all the regions a vision of
 the 79 seats also a settlement in 1982 canada where the prosperity of one region is began to reverse the
 process and in 1984 recognized as beneficial to the others a when the conservatives were elected to canada where bitterness
 and frustration is power in ottawa the nep was finally replaced by awareness that equity and cancelled alberta history autumn
