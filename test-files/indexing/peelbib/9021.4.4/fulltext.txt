 l barker were engaged putting up hay in one of the townships north of calgary they saw a large lynx
 crossing the prairie close to where they were working seizing his rifle which he happened to have at hand mr
 smith started in pursuit seeing him advance the lynx suddenly stopped and crouched in the grass as if in hiding
 as he drew nearer to the animal it crouched lower and lower until its head rested on his paws and
 only its tasselled ears were visible above the grass when about 15 yards distant smith raised his rifle and was
 about to fire when barker called out i ll bet you a v you dare not take the rifle from
 your shoulder and walk up to him i ll go you one smith replied and lowering the rifle he stepped
 towards the animal when within a few feet of the lynx it jumped upon him with a lightning hound setting
 its claws firmuly into his shoulders and endeavoring to fasten its teeth in his throat dropping his rifle he seized
 it by the neck with both hands and succeeded in holding its formidable jaws at a safe distance from his
 face though seemingly at a disadvantage the lynx proved himself a terrible foe at close quarters keeping his shoulder hold
 secure he commenced such a vigorous kicking and scratching with his hind claws that smith realized that immediate action was
 necessary to save his life leaning forward he threw himself full weight upon the animal the shock seemned to paralyze
 it for a moment and thinking he had the drop on it he resolved to if possible capture it alive
 placing his knee across its neck and drawing a stout cord from his pocket he was engaged in tying its
 legs together when the animal by a powerful effort twisted its head around and seized him by the leg just
 above the ankle biting in a savage manner by this time mr barker had arrived on the scene and picking
 up the rifle he sent a bullet through the animal s brainbox though considerably scratched and bitten mr smith received
 no serious injury mr cockle has been engaged setting up the lynx again and it now looks as natural as
 before the fight mr smith won the v but he says he will pass next time calgary tribune sept 11

 delay to 1884 part of my boyhood days were busy traders spent in idndergarien school and tracking heavily loaded boats

 pushing and pulling the boat avenue in the late 80 s and early along shore was slow tiresome business 90

 very low a muskrat the chipewyan language this proved skin sold for live cents a marten from a great asset

 the trail the future of edmonton a fort saskatchewan correspondent gives a sketch of what he expects that place to
 be in 1895 it is to have tlmree railways and be a very large and flourishing city by that time
 there is no doubt some point on the saskatchewan in northern al berta s to be the city of the
 future that will rank next to winnipeg in the canadian northwest but that city will be edmonton before the advent
 of the railways edmonton ranked next to winnipeg in commercial importance and when the extension of railway communication has given
 it an equal chance with its rivals it will rank so again the town its trade and the settlement of
 the surrounding country have all shown steady growth during the past eight years ample proof that the town is in
 the right place on the river in the right place on the trails in the right part of the country
 and has the right kind of people to attract and control ti se trade of the region during these eight
 years people settled at other points along the river have amused themselves with the bright fancies regarding the time when
 railway construction over imaginary routes with impossible angles should make them millionaires and cut the people of edmonton off from
 the legitimate result of their industry energy and enterprise all these hopes have been built on fancied advantages in the
 matter of railway crossings advantages which exist only in fancy and which have no place in fact the saskatchewan is
 not a difficult river to approach or bridge in any part of its course and certainly the opportunities at edmonton
 are second to none at any other point those who depend for a fortune on the chance of a railway
 company preferring to cross at some other point than edmonton are merely losing time and opportunity ednmouton bulletin feb 16
