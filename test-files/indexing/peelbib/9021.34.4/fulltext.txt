 month or march 1988 the west of edward maunsell part one edited by hugh a dempsey during the early 1920
 s ex mounted policeman and rancher edward h maunsell was involved in recording some of the events of early southern
 alberta history while president of the macleod old timers association he found it necessary to complain about inaccurate information which
 he read in the local press in particular he took exception to an article by mrs j w morrow of
 medicine hat who had written that an 1881 jury had freed accused indian murderer star child because stockmen feared retribution
 when maunsell stated that he had been a member of the jury and the woman s assumptions were wrong he
 was asked to write his own version of the incident this he did in a letter of may 29 1922
 now in the glenbow archives m 1002 f 1 then early in 1923 maunsell wrote a long account to the
 lethbridge herald explaining about the introduction of farming to southern alberta and the problems caused by large ranching leases this
 was published in their issue of jan 6 1923 no doubt the article came to the attention of the calgary
 herald later in the year when they were working on a mammoth 40 th anniversary edition of their newspaper as
 a result a reporter visited maunsell and obtained a long interview which was published on oct 13 1923 under the
 title epic of the west unfolded the reporter did not get a byline which was unfortunate as his account was
 extremely detailed well written and has a high degree of accuracy but it was lucky that the story was recorded
 for less than a month later on nov 11 1923 e h maunsell died at the age of sixty eight
 maunsell had been born in county limerick ireland on oct 14 1855 joined the north west mounted police in 1874
 and upon his release he became a farmer and rancher just west of fort macleod in 1886 he married jeanette
 ryan and developed one of the largest herds of cattle in the region active in liberal politics the anglican church
 and community groups he was one of the most respected pioneers in southern alberta the following article is a composite
 of maunsell s two articles and the calgary herald interview in it unnecessary duplication has been eliminated corrections made and
 minor editing done for clarity and ease of reading editor in 1874 i came to canada and at once joined
 the mounted police into the north west territories was north west mounted police force which had just to establish law
 and onier and so help to fit the countiy been dispatched into the north west territories the for settlement this
 could not be done until the selling force started this march from a place called dufferin of whisky to the
 indians was suppressed this trading in manitoba their objective being somewhere at the was done to a greater extent in
 the southwest part of base of the rocky mountains i though capt butler the territories than elsewhere and for this
 reason five had truly named the country the great lone land troops were dispatched to fmd fort whoop up which
 because at that time there was not one settler between was supposed to be the headquarters of the whisky manitoba
 and the rockies animal life however was traders the sixth and last troop was sent to edmonnumerous for the last
 two or three hundred miles ton commissioner french left three troops in the of our march we were passing through
 vast herds of southern portion of alberta under the command of buffalo we killed some of these animals daily for
 cdl macleod and he returned east with d and e food and their condition convinced me that the na troops
 to swan river barracks where the headquarters tive grasses were most nutritive i thought the time of the police were
 established would come when this vast country would prove one of the greatest meat producers in the world finding the
 barracks were in an incomplete as you must know the object in sending the state col french left e troop
 there and returned to dufferin with d troop the point from which ing through this great wilderness of prairie and
 mounthey had started maunsell was in this troop at tains without being well supplied with hospital comforts so to test
 his theory he searched the general s dufferin they occupied quarters recently va wagons when they were all asleep he
 discovered a cated by the boundary commission survey party keg containing some fluid which he conveyed to d there was
 no settlement at this time close to troop barrack room woke up some of his chums and dufferin but it
 sported two saloons which no subjected the contents to a rigid analysis after condoubt had been built for the accommodation
 of suming several cupsful they came to the conclusion most unanimously and passed a solemn resolution the surveyors the police
 remained at dufferin to the effect that it was scotch whisky so they woke for about six months and maunsell
 noticed that up the rest of d troop men also e troop who were some of the men drank too
 much some drank in an adjoining room and asked to be corroborated moderately and some drank none only twice there
 was no investigation into this matter but i during the time he was at dufferin did maunsell don t think
 the general appreciated it because some enter a saloon and both times he was sent on months later when i
 read his report i noticed that he omitted to make any special reference to the duty to escort back some
 man who was lingering vigilance displayed by the police at swan river by too long where the wine was red
 doing their duty in intercepting whisky brought into in may 1875 we started for swan river remaining the territory for
 a short time at fort garry to take on some sup there was no patent medicine drank at swan river
 plies and enlist recruits most of whom belonged to for one thing it was not obtainable the only man who
 the volunteers who had been garrisoning fort garry suffered through this cause was corporal george arriving at swan river we
 found d troop hale and mccrum mccrum was sent on detachment to fort hearty the long abstinence from intoxication did
 not carlton a hudson s bay post on the north saskseem to have disagreed with them d troop remained atchewan
 after being there some months he died and at swan river about a year during which time no in his
 room was found more than 800 bottles of peny liquor of any form excepting on one occasion passed davis painkiller
 which no doubt accounted for his their lips this certainly did not hurt their health and demise the only man
 who could be said to drink greatly helped their bank accounts we were paid by steadily at swan river was
 a strange character named cheque during the time we were at swan river every john wymerskireh who we had recruited
 at fort month we would send our cheques and bank books garry to fort garry and although our pay was
 small our john was detailed to look after the sick stable and accounts showed a very respectable increase every whatever
 disease the horses were suffering from some month i am quite sure this enforced saving had an of them received
 a daily dose of sweet spirits of nitre excellent effect on the men s future john no doubt to encourage
 his patients always took only on one occasion did whisky reach swan river the first dose himself and those who
 had the privilege this was brought in and unintentionally distributed of seeing him do so declared that he played more
 than by major general selby smith he was at that time fair by taking a larger dose than he asked
 any horse in command of the forces in canada and as he was to down john was still alive when
 we left swan river making a trip through the north west territories into and seemed none the worse for his
 indulgence british columbia the government asked him to report on the mounted police when he arrived at swan from swan
 river maunsell moved to fort river he with his staff camped close to the officers macleod here he found conditions
 very different quarters which was a long way from the men s indeed the evening of the day he arrived
 a c quarters troop man came to visit the room maunsell was i was on guard that night and sometime
 after mid in c troop had been stationed at fort macleod night the sentry reported to sergeant tom lake that
 since it was built this man produced a bottle d troop s windows were lit up it transpired that the
 of whisky and invited maunsell and the others men of d troop were also lit up lake took me and
 another man with him to investigate the cause of this to have a drink there were eight or nine men
 unusual occurrence on entering d troop room we in the room after the bottle was emptied somefound not only the
 d troop men but also e troop one asked him if any more could be obtained congregated they seemed to
 be in the best of spirits finding there was a subscription was taken up a few of them were undoubtedly
 intoxicated and one of them rushed up to sergeant lake and said ser for two more bottles now while maunsell
 can t geant i was going to look for you i want you to ar say he did not know
 the taste of whisky this was rest general smith for bringing whisky into the north the first time he ever
 felt the effects of it west territories at fort macleod he found there that a most lake adopted the wisest
 course and knowing he extraordinary state of affairs existed the police could not very well arrest two whole troops he
 got in this part of the country had quickly put an end them back to bed the next day i
 heard the reason to the selling of whisky to the indians and once for the celebration it appears that a
 man named doudoin who was a regular sherlock holmes rea this was accomplished the police had very little soned that
 general smith and his staff were not pass to do the indians were quite friendly the buf 2 when edward
 maunsell went to fort macleod it consisted of a mounted police fort and small village this view about 1880 shows
 the fort at left and main street at right falo still numerous and no settlers had come to was an
 exciting game and of course the police were the country consequently there was no cattle or heavily handicapped the smugglers
 had a long frontier where they could enter canada they could also horse stealing so the most exciting duty that
 the select their own time for travelling so the chances police had to do was to try and intercept an
 occa of the po lice capturing them were slight much dissional smuggler coming from montana to sell appointment would be
 felt by those who remained bewhisky principally to the police themselves hind when it would be reported that the smuggler
 had returned to town which of course meant that he had shortly after fort macleod was built a small fron
 successfully run the blockade tier town sprung up close to it it contained three all possible effort was made to
 capture the stor es the principal one belonging to 1 g baker co who had the contract to supply the
 police t c smuggler s providing it was done on the way in power bro was the next largest and
 next came but once the smuggler reached town he had prac tony la chapelle t these stores expected to get
 all tically found sanctuary as it would be very the trade which formerly was given by the indians difficult to
 get a conviction against him of to the whisky traders they would no doubt have done course he could not
 bring the whisky to his a large business had not the buffalo become exterminated these stores also catered to the
 police and a house so he cached it in a conveniently safe considerable portion of the trade consisted in selling
 place and sold it in small quantities as required substitutes for whisky he knew he could safely sell a drink
 or a bottle the liquor was brought in in cans labelled brandy to the same policemen who a few days
 before peaches the cans contained a few peaches im was doing all he could to capture him on the mersed
 in some fluid which was highly intoxicating prairie but certainly not as poisonous as what took their place this consisted
 of patent medicines which had most no doubt the most eminent of all the smugglers was injurious effects soon some
 enterprising person see a man named lawrence 2 special efforts were always ing that the police were not averse to
 a drink smug made to capture him but without success he even gled in some whisky from montana and this
 led to became bold in his methods of selling whiskey a ver y extraordinary state of affairs once after he
 made a successful trip watch was kept on his house one night to see if he had many visitors the
 whisky smugglers were well known to the shortly after midnight it was reported that some men police and strict watch
 was kept upon them when had been seen entering lawrence s house and remainone was reported absent from town it
 was well known ing there sergeant john kirk and two men were sent he had gone to montana to get
 a load of whisky it to search the house on opening the door they felt was easy to calculate how
 long he would take to make sure they had the goods on mr lawrence there were the trip and when
 it came near time for his return two or three men in the house who evidently had been patrols were
 sent out to try and intercept him this drinking lawrence himself was in bed 3 when the sergeant entered he
 said i have been lean only recall the names of a few of those patent sent to search your house
 medicines which were drunk no doubt they were all lawrence replied all right sergeant i will be fatal but they
 all acted quicker than other substitutes with you in a moment getting out of bed he pulled amongst these last
 was a medicine labelled ‘ no 6 on his trousers and boots went to the washstand which distinguished itself beyond
 all others for quick poured the contents of the jug into the basin washed work fortunately only one consignment of
 this was his face and hands and after d rying himself care brought in but it accounted for the death
 of one and fully combed his hair the police thought he was the serious illness of a number of others
 preparing to go with them to the barracks after com i do not remember the year when the permit syspleting
 his toilet he took the basin and as was cus tern was substituted for prohibition it eased up the tomary
 threw the contents out of the door duties of the police considerably as whisky smuggling he then turned to kirk
 and said now go ahead almost entirely ceased but it was not a success neither sergeant did it put an
 end to bootlegging an applicant could obtain a permit to bring two gallons of whisky into well there were three
 puzzled policemen their the country for medicinal purposes the only available noses told them there was whisky in the house
 there point where liquor could first be obtained was fort were three intoxicated men lawrence although quite benton montana a
 distance of about 250 miles from sober simply reeked in whisky but still not a drop macleod as this was
 rather far to travel to obtain could they find of course if they had first looked two gallons of whisky
 the holder of the permit used in the jug which lawrence had emptied into the basin to wait until somebody
 had to make a trip they would have found it contained about half a gal it was not long however
 before someone saw lon of whisky when lawrence emptied his basin he the possibilities in this permit system by becomgot
 rid of the evidence as the supply of whisky was infrequent it did ing a public carrier between macleod and
 bennot interfere very much with the sale of patent ton he would wait until there were enough permedicines in fact
 some of the men became so mits issued to justify a trip the holders of the addicted to these that
 they seemed to prefer them permits would transfer them to the carrier to whisky the supply of patent medicines was
 together with sufficient money to pay for the by no means constant either when the stores ran whisky the carrier
 s charge for freight was out of supplies they would sometimes have a moderate but he made big money in
 this way consignment brought in by the mail carriers he would get some people to apply for permits on one
 of these occasions when the mail ar who did not require them at that time these he rived a man
 named robinson known as doc 3 would either buy or take on shares on his return was on guard and
 of course could not leave un to macleod from his trip he had to produce a til released when this
 took place he left in permit for every two gallons of whisky this of breathless haste for baker s store
 in the hopes of course he had no trouble in doing the whisky some being left he asked joe smith
 who was that he was interested in himself he would cache behind the counter if he was too late joe
 said in a safe and convenient place you certainly are my laddie we sold out a he did not have
 to wait long before those who long time ago had permits had used them up for a few days doc
 blinked back the tears and then noticed after the carrier had arrived from benton there through his clearing vision on
 the counter in would be a great debauch and when these perfront of him some carpenters spirit levels doc mits
 were consumed it left the consumer with a took them in his hand in an aimless sort of a way
 great thirst this is where the carrier or bootlegand an inspiration came to him ger got in his fine work
 because there would not have you any more of these asked doc likely be a supply coming from benton for
 i guess there s one or two more around the another month or six weeks place said joe who hard
 boiled though he in 18761 saw in some old country newspapers that was was beginning to wonder what in sam
 hill live beef cattle had been shipped from the u s to england this decided my future life i reasoned
 that doc wanted with spirit levels doc bought up all when the mounted police had established law and there were
 in the store and took them off to his order it would not be many years before settlers barrack room
 with the aid of a screwdriver he flocked in and we would have railway communicatook out the glass tubes which
 contained some tion it appeared to me judging from the condition of the buffalo both in the fall and spring
 that domeskind of alcohol he emptied them all into a cup tic cattle could be raised here at a minimum
 cost and consumed the contents doc was very ill af in ‘ 77 i took my discharge from the police
 and ter that a fact which prevented carpenters 1 ev visited my home in ireland a country almost entirely els
 from becoming a popular beverage devoted to stock growing i found much excitement 4 amounting almost to a panic owing
 to the shipment tically wintered out olsen squatted at the mouth of live cattle from the states i was asked
 by many of a small ct ek which has since borne his name as to the cost of producing fat
 cattle in that country but was unable to give this information what i said he subsequently sold hts nghts to
 the indian however was not reassuring to the irish stock department as the peigan indians had selected growers i said
 i had just come from a country where that part of the country for their reserve i saw millions of
 acres of land growing grass natur george maunsell brother of edward who was ally on which buffalo became rolling fat
 and so convinced was i that domesticated cattle could thrive also a member of the force decided to throw in
 equally well that i intended to return and start stock his lot with his brother but george s time did
 growing there they were much interested in what not expire till 1878 in the meantime edward i told them and
 asked me to keep them informed as returned from ireland going by boat to benton to the result of my
 venture several of them said that if the importation of american cattle continued to montana to bismaick in north dakota
 then the lower the market they would consider seriously about terminus of the northern pacific railroad the selling out and
 starting in a country where land was distance by river was about 1 200 miles and the cheaper traveller found
 the four day trip down the mis at that time there were a few cattle in the coun souri the
 most enjoyable of all he returned the try the herd consisting chiefly of a few much next spring 1878 by
 the same route and it took cows owned by a man named joseph mcfarland twenty days to reach benton the
 further up the who had brought them into the country in 1875 river they got the swifter the current became
 from the united states planning to sell butter in some places taking over an hour to go a few and
 milk to the police these cattle were fed in hundred yards owing to the rapids when it was the winter
 time then there was a man named found the boat could not make the rapids it was olsen 4 who
 had a small bunch which prac tied to the bank and a long cable was run out to one of
 the prominent businesses in fort macleod as 1 c baker and co seen here in 1879 its manager d w
 davis leans on the post at left 5 the head of the rapids and then made fast to a them
 pell mell on the way he had to cross dead man the other end of the cable was several deep
 coulees familiar objects on river wound round a steam capstan this with the aid banks and these took him up
 to the knees in of the stem wheel hauled the boat up by inches white mud how long it took
 maunsell to per at this time of the year the missouri was very form his feat he never knew but
 he declares it muddy and the boiler had to be blown frequently was the fastest running he ever did finally
 he to get rid of the mud in the excitement of run arrived panting and trembling in every limb at
 ning one of the rapids this precaution was the point he aimed at all that distance he had neglected with
 disastrous results and the boat run walked and trotted the sweat pouring down was delayed a day tinkering with the
 boiler next his face and over his body caused by his agitaday after going a few miles the boiler started
 tion and haste arriving at the point he aimed leaking so badly that the boat had to again tie for
 he had to cross through a thick bush to reach up for further repairs and from this mishap there the
 river which even at that point could not be arose a very unpleasant adventure for maunsell seen burning with tremendous
 impatience he hearing one of the passengers say that the boat tore through it regardless of clothing and skin would
 remain there until a boat came from ben and finally reached the river completely ton and exchanged cargoes maunsell most
 un exhausted wisely did not get this bit of talk confirmed from whether the boat had passed or not he
 did not an official source he had with him a winchester know and there was nothing to do but accept
 rifle and filling the magazine he started out for the situation and wait he was in a terrible fix the
 prairie which was about a mile distant from for there was absolutely no settlement in the the bank of the
 river to reach it he had to climb country and all maunsell knew as to location was a high bank
 and at once lost sight of the river that the boat had passed the mouth of the yellow the country
 was teeming with game and as soon stone river two days before and the only habitaas he reached the prairie
 level he saw a large band tion the passengers saw was a woodyard where of antelope about half a mile
 away which he they took on fresh wood and the only inhabicommenced to stalk this was slow work for tants
 of this place were a few calves wandering there was immense patches of cactus covering round the place gazing in
 bovine contentment the ground which had to be carefully negotiated at the boat and its passengers to find any habi
 finding he could not get near the antelope he tation was practically impossible as the river took a couple of
 long shots with the only result would have to be followed all the way and the that they started running
 again he tried to stalk banks were thickly wooded then hunger began them but meeting with no success he conclud
 to make itself felt what was to be done for food ed he would return to the boat if the
 stranded man went up on to the prairie for as he was following a deep coulee on the way an
 antelope a boat might pass so maunsell s back two deer started up within a few yards of feelings were
 not at all happy him one he managed to shoot and hacking off by this time the sun was nearly
 down realizone of the hind legs started for the boat well ing that the nights were cold and that there
 was pleased with himself arriving at the point from the possible danger from prowling animals the which he had climbed
 to the prairie level maun wanderer collected a lot of dry wood and grass sell was astounded to see the
 boat steaming up intending to make a fire which would also serve the river about a mile ahead of him
 he at once as a signal to the boat if she passed he knew fired a couple of shots but
 they were not heard that the boat did not run when it was dark so noticing however that the river
 took a great if it did not appear shortly it must have either bend to the south on which side
 he was on he passed the point or had tied up further down the started to run for it though
 he had very little river just as darkness fell the boiler was heard hopes of reaching the point ahead of
 him appar to blow off a cheerful sound to maunsell in his ently many miles off before the boat passed
 predicament so he prepared to light his bonfire so the haunch of venison went to the wolves the boat however
 did not come so he knew and maunsell started out on his ten mile run at it was tied up
 for the night to try and reach the once he lost sight of the boat and lost all means boat
 now that night had fallen was impossible of telling whether he was going to be successful owing to the thickness
 of the brush and tress so in his chase or not this time he was not so par through the
 night he waited and at the first glimticular about the cactus clumps but went through mer of dawn he walked
 down the river and there 6 about half a mile away he saw the crew hauling prevost bottom the first
 thing maunsell had to out the cable to attach to a dead man evi do was to find out how
 and where he could buy dently they did not see maunsell for at any rate cattle there was none in
 northern montana as they took no notice and he managed to sneak ranching had not yet started there he saw
 on board unobserved and got to his cabin chang charles conrad then manager of the i g baker ing his
 clothes he came on deck where he found co conrad said that he could get the cattle so that no
 one had missed him so he said nothing the two maunsells made a contract with him for to the passengers
 who were not a sympathetic a hundred head of cows and three bulls to be crowd delivered in the fall
 the boys paid half the price it was about the middle of june when the boat down and as there
 was nothing else to be done reached benton and there maunsell met col just then ed suggested to george that
 they buy macleod and also sergeant frank norman who a light vehicle and that ed taking the team he was
 an old comrade and a great friend of his j j had bought should go out and prospect the coun
 healy was another man he met healy being at try for a good place to squat that time sheriff at
 benton maunsell presented rigs were not numerous and the only one in healy with a fine blackthorn cane he had
 brought sight was an old buckboard owned by j b smith with him from ireland and the giver was after
 he offered it cheap but on examination maunsell wards told that it was better than a six shooter found that
 one of the nuts holding the wheel to in arresting a certain class of evil doers the axle was missing
 as this could not be pro i m waiting for some more recruits said cured at macleod hardware being almost
 as col macleod to maunsell shortly after the lat scarce as buckboards the deal came very near ter s arrival
 at benton they re coming by being passed up as hopeless another boat and if you d care to i
 ll very gladly smith however not wanting to lose a possible take you with me of course you must understand
 i m going to fort walsh and that will cause sale was sanguine he said look you might you some
 delay but i tell you what i think we possibly get one from dave cochrane as he has can arrange
 for you i saw brown in town dia all kinds of things stored away in his junk pile mond r
 brown they call him he s just come i don t happen to be on speaking terms with him from
 macleod see him and find out when he s myself so you had better go and ask him about it
 going back diamond r as he was always called used now dave cochrane was a very well known to do
 the freighting for the t c powers bro personage 6 he had joined the police at the who had a
 store in macleod he was going back same time as ed maunsell and took his discharge in a few days
 and expressed his willingness to at the same time maunsell knew little of him take maunsell back with him several
 days later as he was in a different troop so he was uncerwith maunsell s baggage loaded on diamond tam
 whether cochrane had revealed any indica r ‘ s wagon and the traveller astride a horse and tion of being
 that brilliant genius he afterwards saddle he had purchased a start was made on proved if there ever was such
 a thing as a klepa tr ip of two hundred and forty miles at the mar tomaniac he was one
 nothing was too useless ias river they crossed by the ferry owned by for dave to pick up and he
 would just as soon a halfbreed named joe kipp after whom fort pick up something else for another man as
 for kipp was called himself if unhappily he was discovered in his the trip was without any particular incident little
 peculations dave s ready audacity and wit and a week from their start saw the wagon enter saved him ing
 macleod here maunsell met his brother and well dave was located he had a house in several of his old
 comrades of the force amongst macleod and on being informed of what was them some seventy five men who had
 re engaged wanted he promptly conducted maunsell into an for service george maunsell had re engaged as inner chamber having
 all the appearance of a a special and could not get away for a few weeks museum after a search
 he found two or three having nothing particular to do until he could nuts which he gave to maunsell to
 see if they get settled ed maunsell rented a cabin from pete would fit none were of any use and
 they were prevost 5 in company with a man named bast returned lan prevost used to cut cordwood in a
 bottom that s too bad said dave looking genuineseven miles from macleod and it is still called ly grieved we
 ve certainly got to get you fixed 7 up lemme see now lemme see i believe i can get you
 what you want sure enough that night he brought a nut to maunsell feeling mightily uplifted over his success next
 morning it was taken to smith s buckboard and it fitted perfectly maunsell put the nut in his pocket and
 set out for smith s intending to conclude the bargain he gone look for horses he was told briefly by
 the indian wife of smith maunsell strolling back to the barracks met a man named a c farwell 7 who
 had the contract for carrying the mail from macleod to benton he was in a terrible stew of all the
 doggoned luck he burst forth as soon as he met maunsell if i ain t gone and lost one of
 the nuts off my democrat ain t that a helluva note i crossed the slough and on the other side
 off came the wheel i spent about three hours wading round in the water looking for it and i guess
 it s floated ‘ t down the stream ‘ the man was nearly frantic with rage and disgust as the
 terms of his contract bound him to catch the boat at benton with the mail farwell the maunsell brothers arranged
 to buy their cattle through charles e conrad above of i g baker and co had been up to the
 barracks seen captain winder and tried to borrow a light police consisted of a cook stove three chairs and a
 democrat but the captain could not let him have table as soon as george maunsell had cornit the only thing
 winder could give him was pleted his police duties provisions were pura heavy wagon which farwell s team was too
 chased at i g baker s an indian tepee borrowed light to haul in a hurry he then tried to
 get cap from j b smith and the two young pioneers tam winder to lend him a team to make
 a four two of the first in the ranching industry of alup but this the captain also refused farwell was
 berta started out to seek a home crossing the furious and frantic old man river they went about six miles
 west maunsell was possessed with an uneasy feel and landed at the homes of two squatters living ing he had
 more than a strong suspicion that close together both ex policemen who had taken in his pocket safely reposed farwell
 s lost nut their discharge in the first house ed maunsell however to avoid awkward explanations he met his old
 friend and comrade thomas a made sympathetic noises at the mail man and boys who later was the author of
 the riders went back to that good samaritan dave of the plains he told the prospectors that the cochrane he
 returned him the nut and said it next squatter was dave allison 8 who had purwould not do he then
 returned to the barracks chased a half share in a squatter s right from a and met farwell going home
 man called fred the ratter abe said maunsell i forgot to tell you leaving boys the maunsells travelled over to
 that dave cochrane has some nuts perhaps you see allison his house being near a beautiful can find one to
 suit spring they decided to stay there for the night the agitated mailman clutching desperately fred s gone to the
 slough for some fish at any straw dashed madly to cochrane s place said allison after greetings had been exchanged
 and the cheerful dave readily handed over all he in a few minutes the visitors saw what they had one
 fitted perfectly and her majesty s mail took to be a boy coming up from the slough with was duly
 delivered smith lost the sale of his some fish in his hand buckboard here comes fred said allison as he
 caught two weeks after this little incident the maun sight of him maunsell s first thought was one sell brothers
 bought an old wagon from pete of pity allison was a man of splendid physique prevost and also the furniture
 of his house which well over six feet in height in the police he had 8 one fault he was
 inclined to be rather domineer and after some private practice he issued a ing so maunsell concluded that fred would
 be challenge to the owner of the champion terrier more allison s slave than his partner of the neighbourhood fred
 was to have the when the ratter approached maunsell saw privilege of catching the rats with his hands but to
 his astonishment that he was more of a man killing them with his teeth than a boy when a terrier
 catches a rat said fred he i never saw the like of him before or since has to shaken um
 several times to kill ‘ um i did says maunsell he was less than five feet in better than that
 i could catch a rat as quick as height his shoulders sloped down so far that his a terrier and
 with one bite in the right place in arms seemed to be attached to his waist his neck the neck
 the rat was dead i easily killed two as wide as his back and was surmounted by a rats to
 the terrier s one face the only features of which were visible were allison later confessed to maunsell that he
 was the eyes and nose the rest of his face was coy afraid of fred and to save any possible
 trouble ered with fur similar to a plucked muskrat bought out fred s share of the claim a few weeks
 however despite his unfortunate looks fred later after that fred the ratter transferred his the ratter was nothing if not
 hospitable and he activities to the i g baker co taking a posiinvited the travellers in for supper the house
 was tion as cook in macleod while there he gave evidently built for fred s accommodation for al an exhibition
 of what he could do with his teeth lison and the maunsells could not stand upright there was a freighter
 living in macleod who in it without knocking their heads against the had a pet coyote which he kept tied
 to the leg roof fred advised the boys to camp where they of his bed whenever a stranger entered the
 were and then ride out and search for a loca house the coyote would disappear beneath the tion so the
 tepee was erected instead of fred bed this action gave an idea for some sport a doing the work it
 appeared that he was complete collection was made and the money offered to ly the boss and allison in the
 position of a hired fred if he would draw the coyote from beneath man the bed with his teeth fred
 cheerfully undertook maunsell got an inlding for reason of this next this extraordinary task and succeeded but was day fred
 asked for the loan of the team and badly bitten in the attempt wagon to haul two logs which he
 had recently the story of how the redoubtable fred the ratcut as the team was not well broken maunsell ter
 gave an unsolicited exhibition of his prodigwent with fred to hold them arriving at the ious capabilities must not be
 missed j j healy place the ratter calmly started to load the logs the sheriff of benton used to occasionally
 come on the wagon and then maunsell witnessed the to macleod in search of criminals who had fled greatest feat
 of strength he had ever seen the from montana it appears that the ratter owed first log was a green
 cottonwood nearly three some money to a man in benton and healy was feet in diameter naturally maunsell thought he
 asked to collect it hearing that fred was working would be required to lend a hand and was ready for
 the baker outfit he thought it a good time to do so he could not conceive how in the world
 and opportunity to collect now healy though they were going to load such a log fred told not a tall
 man was as powerful and fearless as maunsell to drive the wagon alongside and how the position of sheriff demanded
 he went into he did it maunsell could never tell except that the cookhouse where fred was preparing dinner with
 apparently no trouble fred had the log on and closed the door behind him the few loafers the wagon outside
 were sitting idly around in the sunlight even if it had been done by a huge man it and for
 a while nothing was heard they surwould have been marvelous but it appeared un mised in a dreamy sort of
 a way that fred was canny when done by fred said maunsell counting out the change suddenly a tremendous fred
 was a keen fisherman so when maunsell racket burst upon their ears if a small cyclone presented him with a
 spoonhook the pair became had suddenly been loosed in the building the upgood friends and fred the ratter was moved
 to roar of flying pots and pans the yells of rage unburden himself of some of his history it tran
 the oaths could not have been worse the cries spired that he was born near the docks in london of
 rage suddenly changed to yells of agony and in those days ratting was a great sport fred boys oh boys
 said muddy jones he as a lad watching the terriers came to the con sheriff is sure collecting from fred
 fred s had clusion that he could beat any terrier at this game to buckle down for once the noise
 redoubled 9 and the yells got louder fred s gettin tortured in the porcupine hills was a squatter named for

 the years and he returned to benton a sadder and wiser does not think that french sam had yet come

 long by 18 feet from macleod which has since been called the wide and when rutherford got through it looked
 armstrong bottom the rev mr manning more like a pen than a house he showed the arrived about this time
 maunsells how to chink it and then left them the maunsell boys planned to build a house to their fate
 then came the result of the fatal on the site they had selected for their ranching mistake of peeling they
 found it hard to get the operations although this in the opinion of the chinking to stay as peeling the
 logs had made settlers required a great amount of talent maun them too smooth the small poles were laid on
 sell made an arrangement with tom boys for the top for a roof and with a scythe they cut a
 quanloan of a man who was working for him to give tity of slough grass which they spread on top
 a couple of days work at the most critical time the roof was completed by throwing loads of of building
 his first instructions were to get cut earth over the hay they had been lucky in getabout 90 logs the
 lads started for the near by ting two half windows from i g baker s and a woods with their
 axes neither of them had cut friend george clark a carpenter in the police a tree in their lives and
 they found some difficulty made them a door and a frame for the window in finding suitable logs as most
 of the large trees when these were put in place they dashed mud had been converted into cordwood by prevost
 and in between the logs and here again the smooth bastian however they managed to get what they logs were
 a disadvantage as the mud did not wanted also poles for the roof adhere very well they had to be
 very careful then with the mighty enthusiasm of new settlers how they shut the door if they banged it the
 dry the maunsells decided to make some improve mud would fall with a resounding thud to the ments thinking that
 boys and allison s cabin floor of course they had to be content with a looked rather sombre they decided
 to peel their mud floor and roof as no boards or shingles logs so as to have them nice and
 white and clean could be obtained but at that they had their first then ad rutherford arrived the man from
 boys home and a roof over their heads having become to commence on the building operations he experts with the
 axe the maunsells built the frowned upon the peeling process stable and corral without outside help having you ve made
 a mistake was his brief and no enclosures for the horses and not being able 11 to picket them in
 the winter they started to cut the outfit started out on the trip on february hay with the scythe there
 were no mowing 11 1879 tony drove four horses on his wagon machines to be had those who had them
 were and had an indian with him named patsy the contractors putting up hay for the police same night they
 reached standoff where a trading quite frequently the boys saw olsen whom post was kept by dutch fred the next
 day they they regarded as a great authority on ranching reached the st mary s river near the mouth of
 don t get your cattle till spring boys said lee s creek where cardston now is a jew 4 olsen
 when talking over the question of getting had a cabin there he was supposed to be enthe herd in at
 once when they come in the fall gaged in the whisky smuggling business they ll be poor and you ll
 have a tur ble time the next morning it was snowing so heavily to winter them through make it the
 spring and that allison and bushe decided to turn back then you can have a half chance of caring for
 tony said his business was so pressing that he them had to go on this arrangement suited the maunsells quite
 allison cocked his experienced old eye to the well it happened that cattle were hard to get in weather i
 don t like the look of it boys he northern montana at that time and conrad with declared with a
 good deal of warm western emwhom the contract for the cattle had been placed phasis and said no more he
 was going back was quite willing to change the time of shipment while the going was good tony was an
 old ex as well as that like many other young men from perienced plainsman and he too knew the the
 old country the boys were expecting some difficulties they were very likely to encounter at money and this had not
 arrived that time of the year but having his business to having nothing to do all that winter but cut
 attend to he was determined to keep on so with fence rails they lived principally on prairie patsy and maunsell
 the party set out it snowed chicken and deer meat the evenings were often heavily all day and the men
 could see but a short spent with allison or boys during that winter distance ahead of them they had hoped
 to make there was a temporary addition to the settlement the north fork of the milk river that night but
 in the person of a man named jose bushe who were unable to do so because of their slow came
 from montana he had brought a number progress instead they camped on the prairie of horses from montana to sell
 to the indians maunsell thought they were lost as they were but as the latter had gone after buffalo which
 had apparently following no trail but tony assured left that part of the country he did not make him that
 it was all right and set his fears at rest many sales for ed knew that tony was second only
 to the in february 1879 the expected money arrived famous jerry potts as a plainsman from home and it was
 very welcome the form of course the party depended entirely on in which it was sent illustrates how ignorant old
 buffalo chips for fuel so maunsell took a couple country people were at that time of the immen of sacks
 and started out to find some the snow sity of distances in canada and america it was being more than
 a foot deep this was no easy a letter of credit on some bankers in deadwood task he had to
 feel with his feet to find them south dakota ed maunsell took it to d w and so it took
 him some time to fill both sacks davis who was then manager for 1 g baker his task completed he
 started back for the camp co a letter of credit was a new thing to davis he knew it was
 not far away but owing to the and of course he could not cash it as it was gathering darkness
 and the heavy snow he could necessary to have the money quickly to complete not find it all he could
 do was to follow back the payment for the cattle davis suggested that on his tracks this proved a most
 tedious job ed should go to helena montana where the but he finally reached the camp much to tony s
 nearest bank was located he said there was a delight man named tony la chappelle leaving for there the night
 was passed in comparative comfort in a few days tony being interviewed he ex the next morning dawned bright and
 clear and pressed his willingness to carry the bedding if maunsell s respect for tony as a guide increased maunsell
 rode horseback returning to the settle he found they were within a short distance of ment he found that both
 allison and jose bushe the gap later called whisky gap this is an wanted to make the trip and arrangements
 were opening through the milk river ridge where the made with tony to take all the bedding each man trail
 ran that evening they arrived at the fork to pay up for the cost of the grub for the trip
 of the milk river the fuel gatherer had luck in 12 collecting fuel here as the piles were very thick
 health is none too good tony and i believe i during the night a bad blizzard started and it am
 better fitted to go if 2 turned very cold in the middle of the night tony you shut your danm
 mouth burst out tony woke maunsell and said the horses had betterbe i say i m boss and i know
 my business you turned loose to keep them from freezing they stay and keep on the fire had previously been
 tied to the wagon wheels and so tony went and maunsell stayed fed oats because they had been fed he
 thought patsy the indian proved absolutely useless he they would not go far but for once he was had been
 raised by tony from a child and was wrong the elements were against him neither an indian nor a white
 man he spent his all next day that terrible storm raged and day in bed such as it was grunting
 and sleeping howled round the slender little encampment except when he was called to the meagre dinner they could cook
 nothing and had only a few cold and supper the day being clear maunsell very slap jacks left over from
 the night before the sensibly spent his time collecting buffalo chips next day dawned clear and cold and the horses
 and by night had an enormous pile darkness was were nowhere in sight beginning to fall and there was no
 sign of tony maunsell started to make preparations for get maunsell had fears for him because he was not ting
 out a very strong man the night settled in pitch where you goin asked tony black with barely a star
 showing through the out to get the horses was the reply mass of murky clouds overhead fine plainsman stay where
 you are was the response i m as tony was maunsell feared that even he could boss of this outfit
 you go out and get lost and not make camp without something to guide him that will only add to
 my troubles maunsell had collected the buffalo chips with maunsell hesitated look he said your no particular foresight but simply

 thing but it was no doubt that immense pile of was it was the camp fire renewed and chips that
 saved the life of tony la chappelle freshly nerved by his new hopes tony started that night maunsell was able
 to keep a fire go out once more alternately the flame leapt and ing in the hopes that tony wandering
 through that died but the distance was not so great and at last dull muck of sky and prairie might
 see it but tony staggered into the camp and back to life chips do not make much of a blaze
 so ed at fre tony was so played out that next day the little quent intervals heated some grease in
 a flying party was forced in remain in camp pan until it started to burn then throwing some we ll
 start tomorrow said tony the snow into the grease this caused it to throw up horses have gone and all
 we can do is to take a high flame it was one of these that tony saw what we can
 of the grub a few blankets and flywhen several miles away and enabled him to ing pan and kettle i
 know that abe farwell has safely reach camp he got in about midnight a little cabin on the north fork
 of the milk river quite exhausted he used it when he was carrying the mail from he said that after
 going a few miles on his macleod to sun river i have never seen it but search for the horses
 he saw five animals on a i believe that i can find it ridge some miles off believing these were
 the the next morning the little party started out horses he went toward them but getting on low patsy absolutely
 refused to pack a thing he was ground he lost sight of them reaching higher peeved at the weather and
 acted like a spoiled ground once more the animals were not in sight child as indeed he was tony like
 an indulgent believing they had gone over the ridge he fol father said nothing to him maunsell packed all lowed
 on for some miles there was to take as tony was really too weak when next he came in sight
 of them he found to do anything being young and in perfect trainthey were buffalo in deep chagrin and dis
 ing maunsell went ahead to break the trail tony appointment he realized that he was anyway following in his tracks
 and directing him to right twelve miles from camp if not more and know or left they reached the river
 before dark and ing he could not live if he remained out all night found the cabin in a clump
 of willows here the he started for the camp hoping to make it before little party passed the night in
 comfort and predark pared themselves for what they knew was going but the snow was deep and tony was tired
 to prove a long and arduous trip darkness closed around him before he went many the situation was this they
 had to get back miles he then tried to find the river intending to the jew s cabin they dared
 not sleep out as to follow it up knowing it would bring him to they could not pack enough bedding
 and the camp the river was narrow and of course weather was intensely cold frozen over and moreover covered with
 snow tony decided that the best thing to do was to tony crossed it in the dark without knowing af
 strike the st mary s river high up so that they ter a time he decided he was lost and
 determined could make it before dark and then follow the to go no further if he rested he was afraid
 he river down to the jew s cabin they reached the would fall asleep and freeze to death so he
 kept river about 4 o clock and decided to eat their fruwalking in a small circle round and round he
 gal supper from what grub they had left firetramped in what seemed to him an unending cycle wood was collected
 and tony began melting of years the numbness of his limbs communi snow to make tea during the trip maunsell
 had cated itself to his brain and chilled to the bone been eating snow much against tony s wish and
 a slight fever only added to his misery and his he developed an intense thirst and longed for disordered imagination
 light flashed before his water he took the axe and cut a hole in the ice weary eyes tempting him
 from that narrow path for water the best he could do was to strike in which he walked and walked
 but sturdy gravel for the river was frozen to the bottom plainsman as he was he knew even in his
 fever going on a little distance to cut another hole he and partial delirium that they were but chimeras suddenly
 stepped into open water which was of the brain covered by a thin layer of ice concealed by a then
 there came another light a light that coating of snow it was only a few inches deep burned and blazed
 and died down again a light but enough to wet his feet that seemed to beckon through the darkness and
 maunsell got his drink but foolishly for fear the cold to safety warmth and life stopping in of ridicule did
 not tell tony what had happened his weary walk he resolutely braced himself it tony had been cursing him heartily
 and volubly 14 all day for not keeping a straight course in the tempted to follow he did so for
 a short while meantime tony had decided not to start out on and once more collapsed with a groan the
 last lap of the journey for a while he did maunsell was in a terrible fix here he was not
 want to get to the jew s cabin before sun an absolute greenhorn with a near dying man on rise
 for fear they might miss it in the dark his hands and a useless indian and the dying when the
 time came the wretched little party man tony la chappelle whisky trader wolgathered up their belongings and started maun fer
 and buffalo runner one of the best plainssell in the lead he found it impossible to get off men in
 the west was depending on an irish the river as there was either a cutbank or thick greenhorn for his
 life i can t leave him bush on either side the cold remained intense thought maunsell i must not leave
 him what and they heard later that it was 37 below zero would they say to me at macleod if
 they knew maunsell s feet began to freeze and the pain was i left tony to die hard to bear
 without saying anything to tony desperately he went at what seemed to be a though at that the freezing process
 was not very well nigh hopeless task he kept rolling him over painful something like the continual prick of a
 and over to keep tony awake and in this he was pin soon his feet refused to bend he found
 he successful had this happened earlier in the night had to walk as if they were encased in iron shoes
 it would have been the last of tony and perhaps maunsell thanks to his perfect condition of of them all
 but the dawn was broken the sun physical health and strength his determination was beginning to rise and throw its
 golden to keep on and his natural pride in the fact that beams still with little warmth in them over
 the a greenhorn from ireland would never say die frozen river and illimitable plains plodded on they walked all night
 then just the sun the sun mumbled tony and before sunrise he happened to look back and pointed to the
 east and took heart of life again to his horror tony was gone he struggled bravely against what he knew
 to be maunsell had turned a bend in the river certain death if ever he allowed himself to relapse promptly
 he turned and hobbled back as best his into that sweet sleep he felt he needed but it was poor
 frozen feet would let him round the bend morning and gradually the air warmed a little and a few hundred
 yards away there lay tony the temperature had evidently gone up a bit for on the snow doubled up patsy
 standing over tony was at last able to struggle to his feet and him with patsy supporting him they struggled
 on that what s the trouble asked ed in deep dis seemingly interminable trail tress as he reached the side
 of his fallen friend maunsell s great fear was that they had passed all he could get was a mumbled
 reply tony was the cabin in the dark he knew no landmarks and all in tony was going to sleep
 this would be was unable to consult tony who seemed to have fatal and maunsell redoubled his efforts to rouse
 lost the power of speech so they went on over some life into the exhausted man he shook him that
 bleak trail but the end was near for a few and tried to stand him on his feet hundred more
 yards they struggled on and then i can t pack it i can t pack it moaned the a short
 distance away they saw smoke against the half unconscious man skyline it was the jew s cabin and maunsell maunsell
 puzzled his head to know what tony knew they were saved meant for he was carrying nothing that he could
 it was not long before they had tony in bed see despite the appetizing smell of the elk steak tony
 kept putting his hand to his breast pluck which the jew was cooking for breakfast and ing with nerveless fingers
 at the strings of his which maunsell felt like attacking ravenously coat thinking that perhaps he was suffering with but
 with tony safely in bed and dead to the pain in his lungs ed opened up the coat and put
 world maunsell thought he had better look to his hand inside there he found two hard lumps his feet inside
 the breast pocket taking them out he the jew had no stove but a fireplace maunfound they were two heavy
 bags of gold dust sell thought the best and quickest way to thaw i ll pack ‘ em tony sa
 id ed now try and anything out was simply to apply the heat this get up and we ll soon
 make the cabin it must is what he did he stuck his frozen moccasins be near here and feet in
 front of the blaze the moccasins were tony evidently relieved by the fact that the frozen to his socks and
 as soon as the socks were weight was gone struggled to his feet and at off and the feet commenced
 to thaw the pain was is terrible the jew came to his assistance and mounted police came west in 1874

 canmore gold mines the tribune correspondent returned on saturday morning from a trip to the canmore mountains he went as
 far as the white man s pass a height of about 500 feet above the valley level where three mines
 are now being operated by mr mccardell and others with good results so far a sample of the quartz taken
 out at a distance of only about five feet was sent east last august and subsequently submitted to mr j
 f latimer assayer of toronto whose certificates show results of 18 to 26 to the ton and that of fine
 quality gold which mr mccardell has shown the tribune correspondent who has also seen for himself the several letters written
 since july 1894 down to present time all of which are most encouraging the correspondent having visited the mines to
 satisfy himself that such were in operation and that the thickness of the seams were as represented to him can
 now say the thicknesses of such veins are 14 feet 5 feet 4 ½ feet and 12 feet equal in
 the aggregate to 35 ½ feet of quartz about six weeks ago the nor wester had a paragraph in it
 regarding these mines stating that the quartz only showed a thickness of three feet all told which was certainly a
 misrepresentation of facts but no doubt the correspondent had not taken the trouble to visit the mines for the purpose
 of giving much true facts as above stated by the tribune correspondent the miners have so far only gone down
 to a depth of 26 feet and the further they go the better the assay will be the quartz being
 of a good quality the lode or vein is clearly traceable for at least five miles as the white man
 pass creek flows by these mines in good quantity throughout the year there is ever y facility for crushing the
 ore by stamp mills it being of a free milling quality the development of these gold mines should cause a
 demand for land in canmore which is a desirable locality to live in on such developments depend much of the

 of standards was replaced university of alberta and for many community with one divided into twelve grades with the activities
 grades from 9 to 12 being defined as high when the school was officially opened as the school by that
 time there were six students strathcona collegiate institute it was described taking grade 12 at strathcona as the most modem

 that strathcona was a was equivalent to first year university indicates city of substance attainment and a place with a
 that high schools fulfilled a higher educational great and proud future it was widely assumed function in the society at
 the beginning of the centhat good educational facilities would encourage tury than they did in later years in 1907 when
 people to settle in strathcona in 1910 for the cornerstone of strathcona collegiate was laid example it was observed that
 the excellence there was no university in the province while the of the collegiate institute was proving attrac normal school

 province and had good educational facilities thus the school been opened only the year before 5 thus in became integrated

 observed that the government grant grants for high schools the community still had would be increased greatly when the col

 the situa strathcona high school s building was tion was calgary which opened its first high designed to accommodate the
 traditional liberal school central in 1908 8 and the edmonton arts subjects and the sciences which emphasized school board which
 opened victoria high chemistry physics and the various branches of school in 1910 biology 0 the building consisted of three
 floors of course high school courses had been avail plus a ground level basement there were ten able for a

 but classes chemistry laboratories on the first floor the were usually held in public schools along with third floor was
 a large open space with a stage the lower standards the elementary schools along the south wall and small storage
 dressing however were not equipped to handle the higher rooms in each corner standards in strathcona before 1909 for exam
 the high standards in the years immediately pie high school classes were held along with the after strathcona s opening
 were reflections not elementary classes but the elementary school only of its importance as a high school but also buildings
 did not have sufficient space for segre of the status of an early tenant of the building gation of the
 higher standards and were not the university of alberta the university offered 19 its first classes in september 1908 and
 while the parties the only caution that seems to have it waited for the completion of the arts building been
 raised was from the inspector of schools it rented space from the strathcona school board who warned the trustees that
 if amalgamation was in january 1909 when strathcona collegiate achieved was completed and was found to have plenty of the
 continuance of the strathcona collegiate institute surplus space the university moved into the as such should be assured in excellence

 collegiate institute which provided a very comfort reorganization of the whole school system in the able and convenient home for

 his own special volved the official renaming of the collegiate to lecture room and a very pleasant large south room

 ily academic technical subjects were now added the west teachers room 4 and the lavatory on to the school s
 offerings in 1912 the school the second floor as well the university had board equipped a manual training room and
 equal use and privileges of the assembly hall also a room for domestic science at strathon the third floor and
 of the basement the cona 9 the domestic science program consisted grounds and a science room in the latter case
 of cooking baking canning and the like while however the collegiate classes had precedence the manual training program consisted of
 wood over the university classes in the choice of work and some limited metal work in 1914 these hours 5
 the fact that the university and the col technical programs were further expanded legiate could share the same science facilities
 and through the addition of agriculture as a subject equipment indicates how close the two institu in the school curriculum
 at strathcona this tions were in terms of their needs nevertheless meant that a part of the grounds was converted
 the school board was careful to protect the needs into agricultural plots where agriculture could be of its students against

 on showing some of the hardships these people had the canadian pacific railway you will be into put up with
 on arrival lumber to build the first formed that alix is named after one of the house in lloydminster had
 to be brought over cleverest business women in alberta fourteen land 200 miles in november 1903 there wasn t years
 ago an irish woman accompanied her husa house in lloydminster and look at the town band on a pleasure tour
 to the rocky mountains today and visiting the prairie west became so interested truly the change wrought in three short
 years in what she saw would be the coming country was beyond belief lloydminster from an open she made some
 investments in prairie lands in plain of wild grasses had become a busy the district known as buffalo lake some
 twenty bustling centre town lots were freely sold at miles out of the bustling town of lacombe from 30 to
 500 apiece and farm lands given while yet in canada and visiting various points free as homesteads stood between sections
 which of historic interest the lady mrs westhead were selling freely at 8 00 to 10 00 an acre found
 her land investments turning out to ex the lloydminster colony covers 400 square cellent advantage and becoming imbued with the
 miles 4 000 people are settled thereon and 21 idea that life on a canadian ranch would give all churches
 are already opened and occupied the the joys and much better returns than life on an health of the colony
 in the words of the rev mr irish estate decided to try the possibilities of the lloyd has been wonderfully
 good no epi canadian west demic has ever visited the place and fevers are the westheads put plenty of capital
 in the inunknown what is wanted now said mr vestment and while attending to the working side 2 s and
 it is to her public spiritedness that many ‘ wealthy irish people have come each year to look upon the
 prairie fields and to her enthusiasm that ‘ canada owes a number of fine old land settlers in the west
 alix bids fair to become in time one of the big towns in the north alberta dis trict already there
 is a sugar refinery started ‘ a bank finds business enough to encourage its ‘ foundation and many industries of
 a business nature have taken root there the westhead ranch rich in everything that goes to make and encourage profitable
 growth stands a testimony to the keen foresight of a t woman and alix is well named being a go
 ‘ ahead town with a future ‘ a visit to the beautiful prairie home in october found a very perfect
 log castle broad and ‘ pleasant fields surrounding it and every evidence i ‘ ‘ that irish investments had turned
 out o k for the mistress of the estate was at the time on a 4 t il european tour
 taking pleasure while the acres of lamerton rested from the profitable out put of the past year mrs ahx westhe
 id seen here in 1906 had the town of alix named after her mrs e groves wetaskiwin of the proposition
 did not pretend to overlook the i don t want to make anybody think i am the social side of
 prairie life around about lamer owner of this fine farm said mrs e groves ton called after the irish home
 they gathered as she worked the patent churn she stood by when a pleasant little coterie of old and new
 country interviewed and i d rather you d ask father friends hand in hand with the practical duties about how
 we got on out west but he s too busy of the day went the less prosaic pleasures of the
 saving the hay perhaps to stop work and talk evening and lamerton with its hospitality about our successes but if
 you look at the big and its genial welcome has become the social stacks yonder twelve mountains of grain loom
 mecca of the district its summer hunt parties and ing up you ll have a pretty good idea of how
 its autumn outdoor games with winter delights the crop turned out this year in indoor amusement lending all the delights
 of we came to wetaskiwin alberta in 1900 homeland culture and educated tastes with just enough capital to start on
 that means meantime mrs westhead actively superin enough to buy a cow a plow and a horse and tending her
 prairie estate sees to the ranch work i m not too sure but that horse wasn t saddled attends personally
 to the cutting of grain and hay with a mortgage for a spell she added we takes part in the
 practical work of her vegetable bought a half section of canadian pacific railgardens sells and buys stock examining in de
 way lands getting easy terms of payment and tail the points of her pedigreed horses is got it at 3
 00 12 shillings per acre then now looked up as a marvelous business woman her the same land is worth
 15 00 3 and 20 00 enterprise it was which induced the government f 4 an acre but of course
 this is because peoto stock buffalo lake with fish making that large ple are crowding in so fast why when
 we came and aimless body of water a preserve for finnied here first just five years ago you could count
 beauties the same progressive spirit gave her all the settlers on the fingers of one hand and the courage to
 start a fund for a hospital in alix just look about you now why folks have to go 29 a
 hundred miles off to get homesteads and they to her horse s side and straggling behind the do go too
 she added laden native horses canying the rest of the family my own part in the farm work is quite
 all and the small possessions they owned of this i can attend to for i make fifty pounds of butter
 time mrs henderson now a sonsy smiling each week as well as making a big turn over in grandparent says
 had we only known of the eggs and poultry sales i don t want to do any after satisfaction to
 be gained by this perilous trip blowing of cow horns said the lady taking it would have in a degree
 cheered the days and down a great bunch of red tickets marked weeks of that journey we unpacked our bags
 prize but here are my butter prizes first and faced the first winter of the great lone land prized every
 one of them and this summer at the it was october but even at that season of the big agricultural
 fain carried off 26 5 4 s in yearthemudfloorofourlogshack withanopen cash prizes as well does butter making pay fireplace kindled
 to a meny glow seemed like well i should say so the only trouble is we can t heaven after
 the toil of the mountain trip get household help to keep up with the demands we were penniless ragged from
 the travel of the market i could sell three aye and four and tired out but the cheery welcome we
 times the quantity i handle in butter eggs and received from scattered settlers who had not seen poultry but i
 can only do what my own hands a white woman in years warmed our hearts i carry out for girls
 will not stay at farm house baked bread for neighboring bachelors and did labor the bachelors in the district won
 t let them their mending sewing and home comforts gener if you want grain facts all i can tell you
 is ally and the first money i made in the country that this year my husband raised 2 000 bushels
 was made in darning socks i was called ‘ mother of wheat off 80 acres we haven t finished by
 every man in the settlement my husband took threshing yet or i might tell you how our oats up a
 homestead and when spring came put the come out but i can tell you this samples of our plow to
 the first furrow it was all uphill work oat fields have been sent across to the united at first but
 we were all healthy and the horses states to the big fairs there some american vi did well on the
 prairie vetches and we actually sitors asked to be allowed to send the samples bought a cow to show uncle
 sam what canada could do when it would take a whole book to recite the story it got busy they
 said they never saw the like of our oats but we told them the crop was only of that upward
 and onward struggle of the little usual family of eight briefly touching upon the points relative to the winning out
 it may be told how are we satisfied ask me that when i tell you this wonderful woman still working
 industriouswe started with just enough to get along on well now i think the stacks out there answer that ly
 still believing in the western homeland still question what would we sell for we wouldn t winning prizes in life
 s lottery made the place sell our interests here for let me see well we in happy farm life which
 she now holds her bee wouldn t sell out at any figure for where in the farm out of a
 single hive now numbers 30 swarms last year the extracted sweets sold in world would we go and do better
 than we have str athcona her nearest town at 20 cents per done right here in wetaskiwin pound honey in
 the comb bringing her in five mrs t henderson strathcona cents more each year the henderson honey car twenty three
 years ago 1883 mrs t hen ries off first prizes and beeswax too is one of derson wife of a
 british columbia prospector the cash returns from this hive work one banwith her husband and six children one a babe

 nectarine which was travelling by pack horse and in four months time produced at little or no cost the wild
 white made 1 000 miles by the famous yellow head clover on which the bees thrive being in abun pass
 fording rivers climbing mountains and dance in the broad lying fields of the west from covering this tremendous march her
 baby april until late november and said mrs henstrapped to hen bosom two little ones panniered derson i know of
 no country in all the world 30 took the first prize at the edmonton fair last year the hat itself
 equalled anything a hatter might send out to the trade it is well shaped beautifully woven and had a fancy
 edge quite an upto date hat and indeed a crowning glory to womanly resources anyone can make good in the
 prairie west effort more than capital is required out west wealth is won by never ceasing work here as elsewhere
 and you may say if you want my personal opinion that the hendersons came penniless to alberta and that they
 have won out but then said the lady everybody says we have had extraordinary luck mrs frances h towers cochrane
 mrs francis towers is seen here with her husband at no better example of what pluck in the prairie jumping
 pound about 1934 west can do is to be found than in the case of where bees can be handled
 at less cost and with mrs frances h towers of cochrane alberta greater cash results whose husband is the owner
 of the well known another source of income has been the small jumping pond ranch six miles southwest of wild
 fruits a diligent gardener within a large town mrs towers hails from the channel issquare you find every variety of
 fruit and flowers lands while mr towers comes from binningwhich a dealer s catalogue might name her ham england they
 left england twenty two preserved fruits and fruits from the bushes are years ago and came to the prairie west
 with four shown at the agricultural fair and she out sons and one daughter our object in coming distances all
 competitors in each competition to canada was to better the chances of our chil here you might say effort exhausts
 itself in dren when we landed in cochrane then not prairie production but not so for there is still even
 cochrane in name we found ourselves the dairy to visit and here you come at a prime exactly 45 9
 in debt and we hadn t one sinsource of income a fine herd of jersey cows gle solitary penny to
 our name anywhere else give to the market 100 pounds of best quality but this would have made us paupers
 but there was ten per week and top notch prices are accorded plenty of work the canadian pacific railway this
 princess of butter makers on the plains her building through the rocky mountains and men dairy cheese stands second to
 none and her badly wanted husband and the boys went to books kept in fine shape show where 12 cows
 work on the section got good pay and i said gave the record output of 300 pounds of butter i
 d take care of the farm in the month of august besides giving the family with the young children i
 took up my statable all that it demanded tion on the bare hills and just where we are now well
 you say surely you have no more we pitched tent and turned the first furrow in an domestic fields to
 conquer mrs henderson effort to do homestead duties this i undertook well said the lady laughing i won t myself
 but we had the satisfaction of earning overlook a chief source of my pride and in money from the day
 we landed and there was come look at this bunch of red tickets something in the air a kind of
 distilled hope you representing first prizes for home made bread and might call it which gave us all the desire
 to do buns and then this wonderful woman brings something that is the peculiar thing about the out a straw
 hat which she calls her crowning west the atmosphere creates the desire for work glory and tells you that it
 was cut from the gain advancement but we were all as healthy straw of the fields woven at the fireside
 and as could be and work was a joy 31 while my husband and the big boys worked house expenses
 down market at the door and on the railway i went at the garden and put in good prices for
 everything i get 35 cents per enough seeds as i thought to help us over the dozen for eggs chickens
 dressed sell at 50 first winter the way vegetables grew was a cents apiece and butter brings from 25 cents
 to wonder potatoes you never saw such pota 35 cents the year round we raise sheep but not toes in
 all your life as i dug from that patch on for market just for our table use but those who
 the hillside and if you will believe it we had go largely into this industry make it pay for mutnot
 only enough to put away for our own use ton brings 12 ½ cents per pound and wool is in
 but we had potatoes to sell to the englishmen and demand in midnapore where woolen mills are scotchmen who began
 to come in for the west working our beef sales average from 2 500 had begun to be talked about
 and monied eng f 500 to 3 000 600 each year and we ship lishmen came in and settled down
 around us all we can raise at first class prices that gave me my first market when my hus when
 we landed here we had not one dollar band saw the garden growth he was delighted hut we never wanted
 a dollar since we came we he said ‘ the country that can produce such not only got on well
 and prospered ourselves but growth is all right and i m going to put blood two years ago my husband
 brought out a brother and bone into this land of ours he did he and his family from birmingham where
 they worked on the railway and i worked on the farm were in very poor circumstances we paid their and
 in a couple of years we were able to buy out passage money out but i must add that within
 right from the cpr sections of land adjoining our the two years the brother has been here he has farm
 one section after another we purchased repaid the loan has settled on a homestead built paying 3 00 pen acre
 and as the land advanced himself a comfortable house bought the lot it in value 6 00 an acre until
 we owned five sec stands on has two cows and a calf and has tions and i only wish said
 the lady we had earned enought money besides to send for a third bought more for land is at a
 premium now and brother who like himself was unable to get going up every day along at home i began
 with one cow but to day we have no i don t mind if you tell these family seven hundred
 head of stock pure bred and facts said mrs towers it may encourage horses and we raise our own grain
 to feed it s other british people who are struggling along and a great stock raising country and some of
 the hardly able to keep their heads above water it s ranches around here are regular estates gentle the best
 country in the whole world for the poor men s homes just every bit as fine as you d find
 man said mrs towers all that is required at home and everyone is making money as for is industry and
 sobriety why the man who fails ourselves we aie more than satisfied for our cat in western canada would fail
 anywhere for i tie form one big asset our horses and implements am sure our start out was enough to
 dishearten another we rate the latter at 12 000 f 2 400 any one but i have this to say
 from the day we the ranch is worth 40 000 8 000 alone landed on canadian soil we have never
 lacked and please don t think we put that figure as a sale food money or health we worked hand
 but valuation for we wouldn t sell out at any figure found ourselves steadily improving in material we are only
 beginning to enjoy life now it s ways a nd we loved to feel that what we had was been
 hard work and little play for us i tell you ours earned hard perhaps but ours to have and but
 our reward has come to hold my butter egg and poultry sales keep the police business while a mounted policeman
 was driving the crowd back at the races some miscreant pulled out a pocket knife and viciously stabbed the policeman
 s horse the officer dismounted and charged a man with the offence and upon the man becoming abusive the constable
 smashed him one on the snout and laid him out calgary herald sept 11 1902 32 membership membership in the
