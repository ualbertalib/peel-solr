 were hitter hockey rivals and separate and competing economic centres citizens of south edmonton the competition between them was intense
 and divisive the purpose of this began to construct an identity that was paper is to challenge this view of
 separate from old edmonton edmonton on the other hand edmonton hockey around the turn of the century by analysing hockey

 both symbolised this competition alberta history spring 2001 u and contributed to a growing sense of community it was in
 this atmosphere of economic above top competition that hockey developed in the edmonton thirties are seen edmonton and strathcona tony

 two cities he suggests that the covei ed frank oliver publisher oft ic rinks in the two cities were where

 side however wire netting held back the spectators because the edmonton fans were so tough that they had to be
 kept alberta history spring 2001 in cages 4 ultimately for cashman the north south rivalry included high sticking a woman
 using a parasol as a weapon and crowds of rowdy urchins rioting to the tune of god rest ye merry
 gentlemen 5 in his analysis of edmonton area hockey tony cashman has taken for granted that the economic rivalry between
 the towns pervaded all aspects of society however rather than dividing the two towns into separate communities the hockey matches
 served to strengthen the social linkages between them in edmonton and strathcona a new social order was emerging in the
 hate 1890 s and early 1900 s the class lines were not set and there was still potential for class
 mobility by 1906 edmonton had developed into two separate neighbourhoods the working and the middle classes in one and the
 upper class in another this geographic class organisation ran east west along the river hockey to some extent cut across
 these class and geographic lines gary zeman suggests that hockey clubs were exclusive organisations based on the model of british
 sport and social clubs 7 alan metcalfe however argues that while the elites were indeed responsible for the organisation of
 such clubs simultaneously the base of their participants widened to incorporate canadians from a variety of socioeconomic backgrounds 7 furthermore
 richard gruneau and david whitson propose that sports can cut across occupational religious and ethnic relations to offer fun and
 entertainment for a whole community the hockey clubs on both sides of the river were organised along class lines but
 in this era the class lines were not yet fully established the games the parties and even the clubs themselves
 were accessible to most of the citizens the south edmonton shamrocks advertised in the weekly paper seeking the rosters of
 the edmonton teams frank oliver member of parliament and owner of the edmonton bulletin was the team s patron for
 the 1899 1900 season 4 the shamrocks also had prominent citizens as members of the club r parmeter pettipiece who
 was the editor of the south edmonton news while he was a member of the club later became an important
 labour newspaper editor in british columbia after the turn of the century 5 w i sharp 1 e presumably the
 father of shamrocks club member william sharptes ran the hotel edmonton for the calgary edmonton railway company until it was
 sold to another club member w h sheppard in 1904 sheppard was not only the owner of the strathcona hotel
 but was also the manager of the new edmonton breweries 7 finally the anglican minister rev henry allen gray served
 as the president of both clubs at separate times during this period the two hockey clubs were not below however

 social system in edmonton at the time with the prominent elite names there also to recruit anyone who wanted to
 share in 1 the pleasure and recreation afforded by hockey 9 membership dues were low one dollar in 1902 the
 clubs had junior and senior teams to allow for player development and to give people an opportunity to play the
 edmonton thistles organised their junior team the stars as early as 1895 and the south edmonton club s junior team
 the capitals was formed in the 1896 1897 season women were also a part of club life their games were
 not as often reported in either newspaper generally only as a part of larger social events such as masquerade parties
 but women also played an important social role within the clubs they prepared meals danced at the parties and cheered
 ill the bleachers they were a part of the social life of the club as well as active skating members
 the games and practices were accessible to every citizeil of both towils practices were free and games cost 25 cents
 lor men and 15 for ladies 7 attendance at the games was for the most part very good until 1903
 in edmonton and 1904 in strathcona they played the games at outdoor rinks cold days did hurt attendance but the
 general trend over this period is a growth in spectators in 1905 2 000 people attended the christmas day game
 at the thistle rink in edmonton out of a total population of approximately 11 000 that means if one includes
 the potential spectators who came l rom surrouiiding farms and outlying communities about one in four spent their christmas day

 alberta history spring 2001 quite late 27 the clubs also sponsored annual masquerade carnivals to raise funds and these were
 well reported in both newspapers and it appears that they were a popular social activity on both sides of the
 river the news in 1896 advertised the edmonton club s carnival while the bulletin also reported on this social side
 of hockey in addition ice skating was free to all on opening night on 4 december 1896 a few edmonton
 skaters made their way to the shamrock rink because the thistle rink was not yet ready 29 the dinners carnivals
 and free skating maintained a level of informal socialising between the two towns despite their economic rivalry as often happens
 the people of the two towns were enjoying hockey and social gatherings on both sides of the river they were
 becoming a community the social aspect of these games was focussed on the two hockey rinks which became much more
 than hockey rinks the first games played in edmonton were on the north saskatchewan river between the thistles and fort
 saskatchewan s nwmp team in 1894 1895 the following season the thistles built an outdoor hockey and skating rink on
 block x just off jasper avenue and first street the rink remained at that location until 1902 when richard secord
 built the thistle rink on the corner of 102 nd street and 102 nd avenue 3 it accommodated two thousand
 spectators and therefore far more people than ever could participate in the games the thistle rink also became an important
 social centre for the citizens of edmonton and strathcona first as a place for hockey and curling matches during the
 winter then as a roller rink during the summer months the thistle also hosted theatrical performances large banquets masquerade balls
 carnivals political conventions the edmonton militia s drill practice and alberta s first provincial legislature 3 when the thistle burned
 down on halloween in 1913 it had to be quickly replaced 52 on above top the thistle rink was built
 in 902 by richard secord to provide a home for the edmon ton thistles hockey club and for various sporting
 social and political events it was located on time corner of 02 street and 102 avenue above the edmonton team

 always from fort saskatchewan felt compelled on or near whyte avenue in to write the bulletin to complain november 1898
 the club moved the stands to the street side of the rink so we were treated to an exhibition of
 that spectators would no longer hockey here on saturday edmonton interrupt games by crossing the ice to sent down a
 light team of players who get to their seats 34 after the strathcona played a good gentlemanly game rink association

 centre of the whole won what must have been a most community s social life unpleasant ganle by the substantial
 majority of five goals some of their citizens from both towns would men vowing that it would be their last
 routinely cross the river to cheer for match with a police team their team by doing so the games brought
 people from both sides of the the spectator s column in the bulletin river in a shared cultural experience continued
 with a statement about morris mott argues that hockey hockey as a sport spectators in winnipeg looked for and found
 demonstrations of manly hockey is a fine manly game and characteristics in the players when they most interesting to the
 spectators if went to winnipeg vies games between properly played but when the object 1890 and 1903 hockey tested a
 man s of one team seems to be to knock out body mind and morality every time a as many
 of their opponents as player stepped on the ice 25 edmonton possible and smash their sticks it area hockey likewise
 emphasised these becomes a very vulgar spectacle to manly virtues the most often say the least of it it is
 the duty of all reported aspect of all the games was the lovers of sport to call down rough conduct
 of the players in this sense play brute force never wins in the they connected gentlemanly play to world of
 sport and only brings down manliness spectators from both sides of the censure of the public on the team the
 river did not want to see resorting to it 31 unsportsmanlike conduct from any team in addition rev henry allen
 the column had the desired impact on gray a leading member for both teams the thistles club the nwmp never
 ensured that a level of morality existed again played against the thistles the on both sides of the river finally
 in the emerging middle class society in the personality of william sharples one west would not tolerate violence 37 sees
 a good example of how the especially if committed by the force that community focussed on one individual the government
 designed to prevent it to represent the whole the rough play of the police so upset hockey in edmonton and
 strathcona was popular with many citizens in both towns along with curling it presented one of the few opportunities that
 brought the two towns together to socialise in significant numbers fans would routinely cross the river to cheer for their
 town s team amid the fans of the home team u alberta history spring 2001 the members of the edmonton
 club that they were unwilling to accept any future challenge from them the implications of the event are clear enough
 hockey was a gentleman s sport where only reasonable play was accepted spectators routinely linked morality to sport in 1896
 the anglican minister rev henry allen gray joined the shamrocks club thus by virtue of his presence in the executive
 he brought a level of morality to edmonton area hockey 18 in 1895 the church licensed rev gray as deacon
 to holy trinity church in south edmonton the church ordained him in 1896 and reassigned him to the parish of
 all saints in edmonton rev gray took a leadership role in the wider community by serving as a judge in
 the juvenile courts and he helped to develop the community s social institutions gray used his position to ensure that
 the anglicans in edmonton took an active role in the whole conlrnunity in 1899 due to his change in position
 gray joined the edmonton team as vice president neither the bulletin nor plaindealer go into significant detail about the operations
 of the club but it is safe to conclude that with a minister as president a more christian ideal of
 masculinity influenced the members the masculinity of the players was also an important aspect to hockey in the emerging social
 community of greater edmonton hockey not only provided the men of the community an opportunity to exhibit their talents and
 fitness but it also acted to emphasise their masculinity in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries there was an
 increasing concern about the emasculating tendencies of excessive settlement throughout europe and america 4 for many social thinkers the idea
 of over civilisation became a major concern as settlement spread across the globe the opportunities to prove one s masculinity
 became more restricted the frontier no longer provided the challenges necessary to cultivate the idealised man with the world becoming
 increasingly civilised social thinkers perceived a physical and moral decline in masculinity as an adverse result 42 the muscular christian
 ideal of masculinity developed as a response to many of these fears with health and fitness and team sports seen
 as a solution originating in britain in the i 850 s the idea of muscular christianity was an intersection between
 rehgion and sport a combination of robust physical activity and christian moral rectitude 43 linda j borish argues that in
 the nineteenth century muscular christianity referred to the belief that physical health achieved through vigorous physical activity and sport contributed
 significantly towards the development of moral character virtue discipline and patriotism and that these experiences could be transferred to other
 institutions in society the muscular christian was the ideal construction of masculinity elliott j gorn and warren goldstein expand on

 distant war sharphes joined the military in 1899 and left for south africa in february 1900 the alberta plaindealer stated
 that he had left the shamrocks to keep goal for the british empirel in south africa 47 support was not
 limited to the south side paper either as the bulletin also rallied behind sharphes it also provided the coillillunity with
 a brief profile of sharples he was twentyfour in february 1900 five foot six and a half inches he weighed
 164 pounds and he was a rancher 49 william sharples was a player who had been a member of the
 shamrocks for five consecutive seasons was a successful goalkeeper and was a header on the team yet at the same
 time as his departure for south africa he emerged as a player that the coillillunity oil both sides of the
 river could identify with he was healthy athletic and loyal that he was also a christian could only serve to
 boost his role as an ideal masculine figure sharples embodied the â€˜ muscular christian model he was religious athletic and
 patriotic and by being an agreeable masculine figuie he was a character that the two towns could admiie in conclusion
 hockey in edmonton and south edmonton was popular with many citizens of both towns the respective clubs included some of
 each towil s elites hut they were not exclusive bastions of elite domination rather the chubs had members from various
 levels of edmonton and south edmonton society and the clubs evaluated membership in terms of skill not family connections the
 players came from various levels of edmonton s emerging class system tile examples of william sharples as a player and
 reverend gray as mii organiser demonstrate that both players and clubs conformed to the christian ideal of masculinity no matter
 what class the player came from the rules of the game obliged him to accept the gentlemanly sense of fair
 play found in the sport of hockey the moral character of the players and the inclusive nature of the idea
 of patriotism by arguing that this idealised masculine figure made their nation invincible they colonised the world ruled england in
 this case canadaj and built the nation s industrial might 45 in edmontoii and strathcona these ideas of muscular christianity
 contributing to the eveiopment of a single community are seen in the example of william sharples sharples was an anglican
 who attended the parish of the holy trinity reverend gray s first parish in southl edmonton 4 he began playing
 hockey l or the shamrocks in the 1895 1896 season first as a forward then as the team s goalkeeper
 tile reports of the games suggest that he was a steady player not a star but certainly someone who could
 be counted oil for every gaille he played most of the games for the shamrocks uiltil the 1899 1900 season

 the most powerful factor in bennett s decision to scuttle the serkau deal however was linked to british trade and
 the need to retain the united kimlgdom wheat and lumber markets for canadian products as he quoted in the house
 of commons article 21 of the anglo canada trading agi eement of 1932 restricted both parties trading practices witil other
 countries to the mutual level of preference and really gave him ilo choice in tile serkau matter mindful of tile

 trade arrangemllemit with russia he would be prejudicimig canada s position in the british market the fact that russian lumber
 could undercut its canadian countei part in the british market by 30 per cent was reason enough to turn a
 blind eye to any potential merits in the serkau deal to western canadian stocknien the decisiomi to abandon the proposal
 was predictable federal behaviour towai ds the cattle industry which traditionally had never figured promilinently in ottawa it was too
 smiiall and eveml in agriculture that sacrificial cow on canada s altar of economic nationalism it generally paled in importance
 beside wheat and certainly in this decade hogs and simlce the beef industry s nucleus was in the prairie west
 this fact tended to exacerbate regional dif feremltiation in this sense the federal indit ference to the cattle oil barter
 deal was simply another exanlple of how other interests invariably held a higher federal priority than did agricultural and in
 particular westernbased beef cattle enterprises robert weii it appears was no mom e than a willing agent in the whole

 be put to the russians demurring only on the issue of the exact disposition of the bartered oil and coal
 7 a letter by ilis secretary dl burgess pi obably gives the best example that weir expected the measure to
 go through in replying to an enquiry respecting the disposal of the russian goods in canada burgess affirnled that they
 would come in without an embargo 43 weir s handling of the negotiation process was amateurish at best throughout his

 did not check out his credentials guarantees in favour of favourable financial viability or expertise he also customs arrangements a
