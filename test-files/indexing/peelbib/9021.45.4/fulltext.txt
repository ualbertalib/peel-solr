 who had been books dealing with women and western part of that bygone era initially their settlement these were a
 woman in the efforts were limited to pioneer west published in 1907 and town and interviews but gradually they began
 to trail a year later 4 examine the broader themes of alberta history by the first world war a number
 of western canadian women had become one of the most prominent of these well established as authors both in the
 journalist historians was katherine fields of fiction and non fiction these hughes who had a brief but illustrious included such
 persons as nellie career in western canada born in mcclung emily murphy agnes laut melbourne prince edward island in and
 frances beynon many others were 1876 she came from a prominent family one time authors providing articles to and was
 tile niece of cornelius o brien local newspapers or perhaps to archbishop of halifax she attended magazines or newspapers in
 the east or college and normal school in europe sometimes these were long charlottetown and received her essays about their
 journey west or teacher s certificate in 1892 she then articles describing the uniqueness of life taught in several indian
 schools until in the new land for example after 1903 when she joined the staff of the margaret stewart arrived
 in calgary montreal sici during this time she from montreal in 1910 she wrote an undertook research on the life
 of her open letter to her friends describing famous uncle and in 1906 she published the city and its shops

 the journalists they were according to outset and was one of ten women to sign historian elizabeth ward articulate a
 document in 1907 urging the opinionated individuals closely attuned formation of the historical society of alberta history autumn 1997 whom
 we picked up at the cabin of an old lady she had been visiting and interviewing for the story of
 father lacombe 2 hughes also had access to premier alexander rutherford s personal library which was far more extensive than
 any other repository in the city the result was that in 1911 william briggs of toronto published her father lacombe
 the black robe vovageu it was the only book she ever wrote on the canadian west but it quickly became
 a highly successful classic not only was it the first major book on alberta history by a woman author historian
 but it was one of the finest pieces of historical writing by any author male or female it received positive
 reviews in the new york times and was later translated into french and german by the time the book was
 released katherine hughes had become private secretary to premier rutherford a position she held with him and with premier arthur
 sifton from 1909 to 1913 in the latter year she was appointed assistant agent general at the alberta office in
 london england where she remained for the next two years she left that post to write the biography of sir
 william van home which she completed in 1918 however by that time she had become immersed in irish politics and
 took an unpopular stand against the british government during the first world war as a result the van home family
 turned her manuscript over to another author who revised it and published it under his own name for the rest
 of her life hughes carried on an international campaign for the independence of ireland and became embittered when the anglo
 irish treaty in 1921 partitioned the country by the time she died in new york in 1925 at the age
 of forty nine she had virtually withdrawn from irish politics at her death a former colleague peter magennis wrote poor
 catherine sic i alberta 9 later in the year she wrote a long account the last great roundup which graphically
 described ranch life and tile state of the cattle industry after the disastrous winter of 1906 07 unlike most women
 journalists of the period she was not involved exclusively with the women s page but also served as press gallery
 reporter in the alberta legislature as a result of her political contacts in 1908 she became alberta s first provincial
 archivist as p draig o siadhail points out in his authoritative biography of hughes within nionths of commencing her responsibilities
 as first provincial archivist of the newly established bureau of archives hughes had contacted all the post offices throughout the
 province seeking to interview ‘ old timers early settlers of alberta when it was still a district of the north
 west territories when her work came to the attention of father albert lacombe the famous western missionary he asked her
 to write his biography not content to limit herself to the priest s reminiscences and documents in the obiate house
 hughes began to travel extensively conducting interviews both for the archives and for her book for example in the summer
 of 1910 edna shore was travelling by stagecoach from athabasca landing to edmonton when she met hughes above katherine hughes

 this girl english registered with the impression that she was a common another girl i think lalomide they was prostitute
 this view had already been registemed there as misses english as created by those witnesses who had two sisters and
 i asked mccallum the testified in the hours between fisher and night clerk what she was doing oh he english

 mackie for alberta history iautumn 1997 mackie the whole affair was a public embarrassment coming so soomi after his own
 ilarsh criticism of tom english for far less serious infractions of propriety and protocol it was hardly the start he
 had wamlted tile fact that this sort of impropriety had been going on under ilis nose ever since he took
 over nlust have been particularly gallimig as was the albertami ‘ s comment that he seemed to receive considerable enlightenment
 as to how tile city had been policed at night for some months that the whole incident would spell the
 emld of burroughs career was virtually inevitable yet this would leave mackie without a nearby target upon whom he could
 vent his spleen in the months after fisher the man whose testimony had been so damaging was the next best
 thing at the end of fisher s testimony mackie asked him if he had ever been reported for his stay
 at gillam s house itself a violation of police regulations when fisher replied that he had not mackie warned him
 ill a very reassurimlg voice noted the calga news telegram then you will be pretty the commissioners appeared to agi

 that the whole investigation was a farce so far as getting evidence was concerned wrote commissioner graves above this is
 a view of the city hall and the adjoinimmg police station as seem in 1906 it was located at 702
 second street south east the cite of the present city hall q did yoim see the report made by constable
 fisher about this girl english some time previous to this a not to mmiv kmiowledge q it is your duty
 the records will show the reports there a if it was in thc mnomith oj august was not here i
 have looked up the reports and i canmiottimici a report of the girl q if the report was there it
 was your duty to see it a i was away on holidays in august this last response could hardly have
 bolstered public confidence in the chief s control of his office having thrown doubt on mackie s competence as a
 police chief assisted sonlewhat by mackie s own performance collison then went on to demomlstrate that there is animosity by
 the chief against this man fisher and i can say that he has d alberta history autumn 1997 constable david
 richardson reduced in wages for a year but fisher found himself reprimanded for failing to report burroughs neglect of duty
 at the time the seeds of animus between fisher and mackie ilad been sown coilison was privy to this exchange
 and nine months later was prepared to give voice to the idea that perhaps mackie was beilt on seeking further
 revenge against fisher and tilat the accusations laid against him by della english and minnie black were part of a
 frame up sanctioned by the chief himself english was a willing accomplice it was suggested for fisher had previously been
 responsible for the arrest of her father and his subsequent imprisomlnlent in the nearby rnwmp barracks on a charge of
 vagrancy moreover fisher had for some time just as he had clain med been keeping an eye on english herself
 picking up on this point collison attempted to demonstrate that mackie was as remiss as his predecessor tom english when
 it came to keeping tabs 00 calgary s underworld of prostitution had that animosity ever since the his case but
