 93 editorial no teg it may be the present general world unrest that is behind it alls the fears that 
 beset every nation the hasty re armament of mostr the what you wills but certainly the mind of the people 
 fs turning more and more to matters military 0:mil 0:itary some of that is good where it brings to light 
 the laxity and lethargy of a post war generation in matters of defense in our own small private selfish way 
 e are affected by it groups of men who lived and fought together in the last great war are drawn 
 by tales of new rears to think of those whom they knee and with whom they have since lost contact 
 in the last month we have had more enquiries from old patricia s both local and distant than in any 
 similar period since the first patrician appeared over four years ago have we news of so and so have we 
 a magazine lmagine what has become of a former chum only some questions could we answer and the answer to 
 that is that we can be of increasing service to all patricia s 0:patric 0:ia 0:s everywhere if they will 
 use our pages as a medium for exchange of ideas news and information while tales and pictures of honululu and 
 its delights might tend to make us rather envy our b o c brigadier d d jdllacdonald d 3 0 
 m c nil ranks at esquimalt are truly sorry that ill health was the cause behind his journey there we 
 sincerely hope that his return will find him completely recovered from his recent indisposition wo wore very sorry to read 
 of the discontinuation of the springbok that excellent magazine published by the royal canadian dragoons the lead carried by any 
 regimental journal is always heavy and the fear of being forced to discontinue 0:dis 0:continue our own little effort has 
 been with us more than once so far the p i triciak has never been able to don the dignified 
 garb of printing however your editorial staff are still working to that end and some day we hope before long 
 to roach another objective we acknowledge with thanks the receipt of the following contemporaries the springbok the 3tr vthconiaif the

 like the mountain daisy of robert burns thoust met me in an evil hour for i haven t the slightest 
 idea what i m going o write about there should be a jar against a skin me to write articles 
 at this time of the year when wo are really too full for words tis the season of good spirits 
 co i think i shall write a short article one irits and try with that seasonable word to describe the 
 activities of the sergeants mess eor sport re have several games in our mess but the chief sporting event is 
 our annual golf tourney how had i the humour of jerome or the satire of popcf i might describe this 
 event you have no doubt heard of the gathering of the clans well it had nothing on this for variety 
 of shapes and colours never designed by nature show a leg 17011 had some people lugs to show one wouldn 
 t have minded them wearing plus fours i did here one small boy ask as we passed when the elephants 
 and the rout of the circus ere coming however the tourney got under way at about nine o clock one 
 historic morn with everybody in good spirits and truly good spirits in man i wo golfers drove off drove off 
 from the tee drove off from the tee as the sun shone brights f they looked at each other and 
 then looked at me r i hoped to get home ere the shades of the night they drove their balls 
 all over the course i followed them on and sighed for a horse through bushes thick and gulleys deep thought 
 1 the sooner its over thus sooner to sleep it s goodbye to the ear and the smoker j sergt 
 roberts really distinguished himself by shooting balls up trees i didn t know what kind of tree it was but 
 with him it wasn t very poplar pun certain scotsmen paraded next morning in bathing suits to capture the lost 
 balls coming doan the river i really was sorry for the member who couldnt take part in the meet because 
 he couldnt find the ball he lost on the way out y hcji the smoke had cleared and the scores 
 were counted the cup went to sergt doyle 30 he straight away went to town to bring his sweetheart to 
 the dance to see the presentation 0:present 0:ation i was lucky enough te win an iron not for pressing for 
 you may not know that we use them in the game i know some who should play it in irons 
 over 
 tut e have had our usual winter card parties since the season set in and they too are most enjoyable 
 to the average 0:aver 0:age english man they are like tho spoiling of teghnabruigh t they know how it starts 
 but few know how it finishes the december 0:dec 0:ember party took the form of the annual christmas draw when 
 the members came cut of the hut my name wasn t called so i was glad i hadn t bought 
 tickets somehow one always links spirits with imports and those include since last writing serge waterman who s i may 
 venture is not just strictly a water man sergt quinn who came in time to hole the football team win 
 the garrison championship 0:champion 0:ship and s sergt smith who came in time to meet tulip to bo discussed later 
 then of course we welcome our commanding officr and captain balls who both attended the draw with what luck i 
 do not know wo have reports as well as imports and between sports and spirits this is no dry article 
 it has been reported here that sthe 0:s 0:the r s m may win the golf cup before going to

 day to play in the capital city he is now managing the garrison team and a vast improvement is already 
 obvious since his taking over the team has won one game lost one and drawn one and have advanced into

 with a good system also the

 a senior b team which plays on saturday as senior a and on sunday e s senior b in fact

 of whom two became casualties one had to leave the game and the other played on with a dislocated shoulder 
 he is pte scott p p c 8 1 bice gdlngs scott that is the spirit that made the traditions 
 of our regiment i mentioned in the last edition that we hoped to find two centre threes but i am 
 afraid that as the season draws to a close so far no one has been discovered who shows promise of 
 filling the positions the senior b are now leading their section in the second half of the league with a 
 chance of meeting the havy winners of the first hals and a trip to vancouver let s see you make

 our own inability to locate their addresses lately however we have been greatly cheered by enquiries from several sources regarding

 to write us of their doings the toronto p p 0 l 1 service club has brought up through a 
 letter to our oeinmanding officer lt col w g colquhoun m c the very moot point that august 1939 will 
 be the silver jubilee of the founding of the regiment it is not a bit too early to start seriously 
 considering what form of celebration should tojce place at that time and the editors of the patrician hope that they 
 may be of service to patricia clubs throughout canada in providing a medium for exchange of ideas discussion etc on

 r egnl jjet us cerjßionoo from the begin during the latter part of july we were quietly sporting away our 
 time at a swanky summer rendezvous which by the way bears the delightfully simple title of shilo perhaps ou have 
 heard it lovingly spoken of as shilo unpfi the band comparing it to stratford on avon or some equally beautiful 
 place while thins engaged the fateful morning of monday july 26th come around so also the rest o us came 
 around after a earning from the orderly sergeant we were info medthat the band had been detailed to proceed to 
 iv company at victoria and supply the musical portion of their cis play at the military tatoo ell you could 
 have knocked us over with a a leather b a carden bloyd c ete six thirty thursday evening found us 
 puffing out of canadian pacific s winnipeg depot and on our way by we were puffing has never been bully 
 explained to me but i suspect that in many cases it was cue to the speed with which we under 
 the able guidance of the now retired band sergeant simpson broke camp before it broke us beat a hasty retreat 
 to bert osborne and proceeded to snatch a few hasty practices b etwo en meals little needs to he said 
 concerning the train trip and its pleasant memories or delicious dining car meals comfortable 0:comfort 0:able berths and some good

 him raving and one look at his ace would have convinced even the most doubtful reader on the aesthetic loveliness 
 of femininity brankly we were worried until boway heeler brought out a little blue box courtesy of chick gale and 
 introduced charlie to one of those friendly little chocolate tablets reedlees to say he recovered the towering rockies vancouver and 
 the night ride on the ss princess elizabeth all fade into oblivion and we ecall our arrival at dork point 
 barracks on sunday morning raj or edgar extended us a friendly welcome and in no time we cere well established 
 and walking about hs though we owned the place it is not amiss to mention here thet the free frank 
 and friendly attitude with which b company welcomed 
 122 us allowed us snots of interest arid made each feel like one of the family was what made our 
 stay a real success kembors of the band still occasionally mention and in no uncertain terms that they regarded that 
 trip not as a duty performed but as a most enjoyable holiday it is old news now that the tattoo 
 was a knockout however some of our impressions might be of interest 7o wore struck by the fact that the 
 show was colorful carefully planned nd beautifully executed it had an extraordinary variety of interesting subj e ts which ran 
 from the laughable uniforms of the old coast brigade to the tense drama of a mimic war battle the stately
