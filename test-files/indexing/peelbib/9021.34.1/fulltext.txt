 clergy of other denominations mcdougall fairs were causing a noticeable revival of pagan declared indian religious ceremonies this disturbing as
 for the dances themselves it must be borne in mind revelation was more than the board could that while some
 of the indians are catholics and some countenance since by implication it would mean protestant there are many who still
 cling to the old faith and these have as much nght to join in the that the indians were turning
 their backs on sun dance or the thirst dance as a methodist has to christianity some members seeking a scapegoat

 several decades the very basis of that agent e h yeomans of the peigan reserve policy was intolerance for the

 from three to eight weeks and with the past the outlawing of the potlatch of consequently work interruption insufficient the
 west coast indians and the sun dance on the remuneration at the fairs to cover the indians plains were classic
 examples of abusive and costs increased frequency of intoxication and strong arm tactics aimed at forcing indian com immorality the

 egan general passenger agent ives of the m m and capt wastie arrived yesterday morning from their trip to the
 rockies they report having had a pleasant time and enjoyable weather mr ives was particularly struck with the grandeur of
 the scenery they proceeded west as far as the beaver and found the men at work in their shirt sleeves
 they report coal as being found in abundance one man reporting to have discovered one of the largest seams of
 coal ever known it being 80 miles long and 40 feet deep specimens of the coal were in the car
 in fact specimens of one thing or another were to be seen in almost every corner of the car picking
 up a petrified bird that was lying beside a beautiful stalactite the reporter asked the genial superintendent what it was
 and where it was found he relied that sir leads me to tell you of the greatest discoveries of the
 day it was picked up at the side of a pure sulphur spring at banff which name will possibly be
 changed to that of sulphur springs right in the heart of the mountains there is no doubt that its medicinal
 properties are great and it will not be long before it will become a favorite resort for invalids its temperature
 varies from 75 to 200 degrees referring to mr ives it is something wonderful isn t it wonderful i should
 say so soon they will require no doctors out there at all all the men have to do is to
 take a sulphur bath and they come out renewed why out there the boys had a mangy dog so bad
 they decided to shoot him but his hair had grown so stiff that bullets glanced off harmless it was at
 last decided to throw him in the spring and drown him he was thrown in but not drowned in fact
 he rather liked it and after revelling in the newlyfound element for a while made his way to the shore

 further 20 or 30 written to the bishop asking him to rescind the suspen beyond the diocesan grant of 30
 these lambeth sion so far no answer has come the fact is that there palaces were the wooden huts which
 each catechist is the greatest disfaction among the catechists with had to build to serve as their home and mission
 hut the way they have been and are being treated for in the face of this situation we received a

 tellmade any complaints much before but things have ing us that we are to pay our own railway fare to
 colbeen getting pretty bad the 50 who were in camp lege at prince albert or get our congregation to do
 at saskatoon were the first to complain and they nearly so and that 5 a week will be stopped out

 purpose but the fact the expenses down to 25 c per cap diem you can live remains that it was
 collected for mr h a edwards at a boarding house for 5 a week and have everything horse in his

 not all used on the horse the remainder should have have very little furniture tables chairs lamps desks gone to
 help some other work in the islay mission will be all that can be provided this we can cheerand not
 applied to any other purpose without the con fully put up with but i do not feel inclined to pay
 sent of those who gave it so dearly for it in view of our other expenses the you know that
 when we came out we were pro freight alone not including our fare of getting all mised that catechists will
 be classed as first se the required stuff to college will cost quite a lot and cond or third class
 men according to the bishop s the fare from here is about 20 judgement the stipend allowed catechists 360 harold
 complained that he had been directed 420 and 480 per annum respectively and would to build a stable large enough
 for two horses and commence on may 1 st 1907 the fact is we are all being paid 360 only
 and we are required to do things put up enough hay to feed them for three months out of it
 of which we had not the slightest forewarn the catechists took turns in going to college so ing also we
 were not paid anything until july 2 nd that no area was ever completely without servexcept for 15 which we
 were allowed to draw in ad ices as a result he had to take care of and feed vance at
 saskatoon so that we worked from may until then on nothing in an unknown country where we the horse of
 the catechist in the next district while knew no one and could not get credit the hardships he was at
 college he said the stable had to be and privations which this caused you ll know some one wall thick
 and sodded the lumber cost 25 thing of so i will say no more excepting to say hat and ploughing
 another 5 they are still unpleasantly fresh in my mind harold also complained that the blankets pro our congregation has
 to build this and provide hay vided for the catechists were totally inadequate and pay out railway expenses and if
 possible a balance for even the cool nights in summer he said they which will go towards some necessary college
 furniture well this they cannot possibly afford to do were hardly thicker than flannelette sheets and the season has been
 a disastrous one most of the when cold weather came he was obliged to buy hay was spoilt by wet
 weather and the extraordinarily more blankets early severe frosts have ruined the crops all about 22 here people had to
 cut their oats green and are using cular a tone which the others had never intended them for foo i
 the 3 have been unable to get enough the man then sent copies to all catechists in the the little
 precious time that is left before i reezing up distnct and in order to avold any appearance of to get
 any for us they are doing all they can do on deception as of working behind their backs they the
 churches giving their time and labour willingly sent a copy each to the bishop and the archand wasting whole precious
 days in hauling materials deacon more than this they cannot be expected to do and we could not think of
 asking them and as for telling in answer to this the latter wrote out a long list of them that
 they must pay our railway expenses when charges against us many of which are directly untrue they can hardly afford
 to buy their own bread it is telling us that he had sent this list to the bishop requite out
 of the question questing him to suspend us all and forbid our attend in view of these pressing and almost
 overwhelming ing college at all this year although the diocesan conproblems 5 of us who were summoned here to meet
 stitution ordains that a man may only be suspended the bishop and archdeacon at venirillion on for a crime heresy
 or wilful neglect of duty and then september 22 nd took the occasion to lay these points only by the
 bishop we are suspended by the archbefore them as respectfully as we could the bishop deacon without trial and the
 suspension has since been appeared to sympathise with us but not the arch confirmed by the bishop without our being
 afforded deacon we asked to be allowed to cater for ourselves an opportunity of appearing before anyone to whom at
 college now at prince albert like we had done we can deny the archdeacon s unjust unkind and unat saskatoon
 as we felt sure we could manage on less true charges than 5 a week and the only satisfaction we
 could i will deal with these charges one by one they are get from the archdeacon was that if we
 could not pay 1 st that the issuing of this circular was a most imfor it at the time it
 could be stopped out of our next proper act in view of the fact that the bishop was quarter s
 cheque we therefore decided to draw up in vermilion at the very time it was being secretly a circular letter
 to each of the catechists in the field prepared and issued telling them on what points we had protested to
 the the charge of secrecy is untrue in view of the fact bishop and the archdeacon and suggested that they
 that we sent copies to the archdeacon and to the could do likewise so that they might see that we
 were bishop on purpose to obviate this and we laid all these not just an isolated group of malcontents but
 a united matters frankly before the bishop and archdeacon at body of men anxious to fmd away out of very
 grave the time of their visit with no effect difficulties 2 that we did not live in saskatoon at 25
 c a day unfortunately the man who was given the task in answer to this i can only say that
 that is what we of getting the letter printed took it upon himself men paid also what archdeacon and the
 reverend to insert some very offensive phrases and to james boyle who were in camp with the men at the
 time pard themselves i have this from mr davidput certain words m mverted commas and to print son whom the
 archdeacon appointed as caterer and others in capitals the effect was to give the cir i have no doubt that
 mr boyle whose address is 20 r although he had problems with the bishop harold edwards finally graduated from the
 theological college in prince albert he is seen here with other catethists preparing for the convocation 23 wesley street waterloo
 liverpool england will endure the thought that the church s work would com borate this cease as that these few
 weeks before freeze up so 3 that you are not being charged 5 a week under inestimably precious for building
 should slip away the college project you are being given academic wasted this letter has never been answered so far
 divinity lectures for 3 months free of charge nearly three weeks have elapsed meanwhile the the fact remains that however
 the archdeacon may district is in an uproar everybody is furious at the now wish to regard it we were
 promised in england services being stopped letters of sympathy keep that we would be paid at least 360 per annum
 and coming in from all over the diocese other catechists that we should be given 3 month s college education
 are writing to us tales of distress and hardship and as well but that the wording of the circular against
 overwhelming perplexities with which they re faced which we remonstrated nina the sum of 5 per week and thanking us
 for having made any protest will be charged out of the stipends for board and i am remaining with terry
 and we are doing what lodging each student will also pay for his own we can to house the others
 we have only a few cents washing etc between us and one catechist ashley has got work 4 the secretary
 treasurer reports that he has on the railway down south to keep himself going received only one contribution from all
 the missions this man had paid all his own fare and expenses and you are serving provided his own outfit
 we are seriously thinking now this charge insinuating as it does that we have of following his example as it
 is manifest that we mis applied the money taken at collection is particu cannot remain here being paid nothing indefinitely
 larly uncalled for in view of the fact that the ar and the archdeacon s instructions to wait here until
 chdeacon has himself explicitly directed us to bank further notice if any is distinctly vague and unbusiall these moneys at
 the canadian bank of commerce nesslilce the worry and trouble and responsibility are in vermilion and to get back those
 collections which terrible i have here in the canadian bank of comwe had already given in this the bishop did
 not merce 75 plus 5 plus 40 equalling 120 600 know and he doubtless passed judgement on the which has
 been suscribed and collected by the st charge believing it true paul s cathedral people and by you i am
 responsi 5 we are also charged with thinking more of our ble to them and to you for that money
 and i don t own comfort than the work of christ and of not know what to do with it
 i have refused to hand it making the slightest effort to raise any money in our over to the diocese
 as directed as in view of the arown missions chdeacon s action in regard to the money collected in view
 of what you know of my endeavours to raise for my horse there is no guarantee it will all be
 used money for the churches this charge seems ridiculous in the mission for which it was collected but in answering
 it to the bishop who does not know i want your advice and instructions in regard to this of these
 things i said had this been true i would and also advice and instructions from mr morgan point out with
 all respect for your lordship that i brown about the st paul s money the points i want would have
 thought more of building my own lam instruction on are beth palace than the churches whereas i have been a
 am i to hand over the money to the diocese straining every nerve to get those churches up and unconditionally
 to insure they re being built and finished as nicely b or on condition that it be spent on my
 late as possible while i have had no time yet to see about mission my lambeth palace as to figure
 out the lumber for c or am i at liberty to spend it in another diocese it and the diocesan
 grant towards it 30 is still in on church building if i can get work there the rev we gilbert
 s hands d or is any of it or all to be returned i have returned all money that was
 given to me by harold said that since archdeacon lloyd sus the diocese including the 30 which was to have
 gone pended the five catechists he was denying an towards my lambeth palace area of between 3 000 and 4
 000 square miles as regards myself i have no money at all and am from all church services and ministration
 all trying to get some work nearby if possible to keep me dunng the wmter i believe next spnng i
 might church construction in this area was at a stand obtain work under the bishop of calgary or edmonton still
 including seven churches which were about they need men equally as badly as the diocese of to be built and
 foundations for another two as saskatchewan would you advise this step or would winter was coming he feared all work
 would halt you advise me to try to earn enough money here by until snrino other means to come home
 in two or three years and i o go to college in england of course all question of our pay
 is stopped and we are directed to return ordination in this diocese is at an end the people at once
 all church property consisting of beds here are extremely kind and have been doing all they blankets stove utensils pony
 cart etc an order can for us cooking meals and sending us potatoes which did we comply with would leave
 us without there was a meeting of catechists in verrnillion yestera roof over our heads or a bed to lie
 on in a country day to think over what we had better do some men where we are penniless we
 are also directed to re came more than 140 miles many of them had written main at vermillion until further
 notice if any to the archdeacon before they got our circular pro i wrote to the bishop immediately i received
 this testing against these charges and assessments one letter replying to the charges and asked permission man who like myself
 has been sponsored by the to go on with the construction of the churches and s p g and who
 understood that they had guaranteed continue the services i said i would willingly do this his stipend for three years
 has been told that he must even t hough my pay had been stopped as i could not raise 100
 of it in cash from his congregation 24 harold edwards above lived in a tent while he built his lambeth
 palace in vermilion after much thought and in view of the fact that we i have today forwarded harold s
 letter to miss understand that the archdeacon has written to the two m keone i hope we shall soon have
 happier news societies spg and c ccs concerning his charges from harold i have told him not to part with
 the against us we decided to lay our side of the matter money collected by choristers past and present and
 before the societies as we think they should know how that as soon as i hear that things arc properly
 settled their men are being treated the c ccs men arc i have some 15 more to send i am
 writing also to writing direct to mr mullins and mr boyle and the his bishop spg to bishop montgomery basil
 got his son s letter from miss m keone i have written this to you because i naturally want and
 sent it to bishop montgomery he replied you to know all about it and need your advice but i want
 you to send this letter on at once to rev n m on december 20 th morgan brown at the
 choir house dean s court i suppose you saw the pnnted circular which sug london e c aslam responsible to
 him for that 75 gested that a catechists club should be started to de he i know will pass it
 on to bishop montgomery fend their rights it was that which startled me because and if the bishop would kindly
 let you have it back it seemed to me to be a trade union circular it was again when he
 has read it i would like it to go direct all so pathetic because it seemed as if those poor
 to brimpton and the usual family round i would write fellows had not realised that they were members of separately
 to bishop montgomery if i could but such a family and that we at all events were most anxious a
 letter as this çloes 0:cloes take so long to revise every scale of salary and expenses so as don t worry
 about me unduly i think i shall get to make them happy that of cour se is still our something
 soon you know i am pretty handy with position my fingers and i have all my tools here i have
 an you will understand that it is a very delicate matorder to tune a piano already the ladies of the
 english ter for us to criticise anything in a diocese our offi church vermillion gave us such a good do
 yester cial position is that we simply give a block grant to day and got beds for us all and
 sent us away with the bishop and he does exactly what he likes with enough cooked stuff to last quite
 some time i must it and lets us know what he has done but i think end this now i
 have written this by detachments when the best thing i can do now is write to the bishop i could
 find time much love to you dearest father privately and get him to put gentle words into his i will
 write again very soon and in the meantime i magazine have not done anything of which you will be ashamed
 please understand that this is only a private note basil edwards sent his son s letter to the rev it
 would never do for us to write to the catechists behind the bishop s back that would strike me with
 morgan brown in london and received the as much horror as the idea of a trade union i fancy following
 reply things have settled down quite calmly out there by 25 this time letters of course come to us so
 much later that time there is every indication that things will be the whole matter has blown over i expect
 completely changed i think that we have touched very privately indeed and for you alone it seems bottom to me
 that the diocesan authorities were not very sympathetic and didnot put themselves in the place of despite the chaos in
 administration once all those young fellows but nothing must induce me to parties knew both sides of the picture there
 was say that to the catechists no more ifi will but a new sense of comradeship before the end of
 the year he boys were rein churches and mission houses were built and servstated and resumed their studies and work
 ices held in remote places the archdeacon harold then wrote to his fiancee telling her of found that instead of
 going it alone if and when the outcome of the protest he shared his anxieties and troubles with those re
 archdeacon lloyd i want to say that i have actually on the field they gladly shared the changed my mind
 about him it is rather a humiliating burden and followed him to the furthering of the thing to do perhaps
 but it is certainly right and fair christian religion and help in undeveloped areas that i shall let you know
 i wish he had explained sooner later when a new bishop was needed my father i have been seeing him
 daily now for two months was one of archdeacon lloyd s staunchest supboth in public and behind the scenes and
 have also porters in getting the bishopric gone thoroughly into the expenditure and application of all money received on behalf
 of the catechists with meanwhile harold s work and studies conthe diocesan treasurer mr davis after seeing every tinued on
 one occasion he was sent by archthing all round i want to express my convictions that deacon lloyd to visit
 an area of which very little the archdeacon is an absolutely upright and straight was known to make a list
 of all the farms and forward man he is very impulsive perhaps hasty their inhabitants their denominations and but straightforward
 absolutely and most kind hearted he has not hesitated to say straight out where he had whether any baptisms or
 marriage services were been mistaken and i feel i ought to let you all know needed that i have been
 much mistaken inmy estimate of him on this journey harold had had a hard trip with and have imputed imaginery
 motives in my attempt to explain the facts his pony fighting his way through a sudden snow briefly the position
 is this we are suffering much storm until he finally saw the light of a small discomfort inconvenience and have
 had promises log cabin in the distance after bedding down broken money short etc everything pointed to gross his horse
 in the stable he was made welcome inculpable mismanagement by the settlers in the little whitewashed room and on the
 other side the archdeacon could not fulfill promises when promises made to him were not ful given a good meal
 of rabbit stew the family fille d the loss of tents and baggage was not his fault consisted of mother
 and father their buxom the present shortage of money is not his either peo daughter a gangling friendly youth and
 a small pie have promised money for the catechists fund and lass apart from the front door there was only
 have not given it the societies are allowing only 70 one other door leading from the room at 8 30
 per man they have to pay each man 360 there are now 90 of us which is a loss of
 24 on each man the small girl disappeared next the buxom lass the money provided for outfits carts ponies etc
 was bid them good night and also left the mom soon insufficient owing to the sudden rise in costs last
 y afterwards first the mother and then the father there is a debt of 800 on that alone iam quite
 con bid harold and youth good night finally harold vinced that they cannot fulfill their promise of paying me 420
 this year i shall be lucky if i get 360 and got up and said he would turn in with
 a horse there is nothing to be done but grin and bear it blanket in the stable but the youth
 was appalled i find on enquinng at the bank that this divinity no no need he said mam has made
 ar college scheme is being borne chiefly by bishop rangements if you don t mind sleeping alongside newnham and archdeacon
 lloyd themselves their of me with that the two went through the door own private account being overdrawn to keep
 the thing going it is hoped that when the bishop gets over to into what appeared to be a smaller
 whitewashed the pan anglican meeting help will be forthcoming room with one bed in the corner harold didn t the
 bishop is worked almost off his feet and the notice any other details as a sudden draught blew archdeacon is
 almost on the edge of a nervous break the candle out as matches were very precious down mrs lloyd tells
 me that preparing his lectures which are admirable and reading and correcting they didn t bother to relight it stan
 got into bed papers etc keeps him up to 2 to 3 o clock every single next to the wall
 in his underwear but typical night and we must excuse it if he is a little impatient greenhorn englishman that
 harold was he cornor hasty sometimes pletely undressed and pulled on pyjamas which i was having dinner at the bishop
 s yesterday and he fumbled out of his bag he then eased his way there does not seem to be
 much doubt that i will be ordained two years from now and no one is more into bed where the
 youth was already sound anxious than the archdeacon that i may be also by asleep 26 suddenly harold felt the
 bed shake although ah said the unrepentent catechist i his companion lay quite still then the bed shook thought if
 my archdeacon had slept in the same again gingerly harold put his hand out to touch bed as the fair
 damsel plus the others of course the wall but it wasn t a wall it was merely a i could
 never be teased by him sheet hung down from the ceiling to bed level hmmm said the archdeacon yes i
 see and the whole family plus himself were in one i think perhaps the bishop should visit some of gigantic
 homemade bed the remoter parts of the diocese the blanks cer in the morning first the father then mother tainly
 feed one very well and give one a great came past the curtain and through the door to the welcome
 i shall recommend them to his living room then the youth got up but edwards lordship pretended to be sound
 asleep with the blankets incidentally by the time the bishop made his well pulled up to his chin after the
 two rounds the buxom daughter had got engaged to daughters with some whispering tiptoed from a young farmer a few
 miles away and the bishop behind the curtain to the other room harold leapt was asked if he would perform
 the marriage from bed and put on all his clothes over his py ceremony jamas he did a sketchy wash
 of hands and face on another trip in winter harold stopped off in the tin basin and went into the
 other room to join the family where he had a hearty breakfast at midday at a little log cabin with
 a sod roof where he had been told that a cockney and his they wanted him to stay longer as
 the snow was still falling but harold explained that he had to very homesick wife lived there was no stable
 so he hitched his pony to a rail flung an extra do his job in a certain time he said
 if he followed hudson s bay blanket on its back and went in the fence line he should be all
 right to visit at one side of the room was the bed and after several days he had finished his
 survey a chest in the middle was a trestle table which and reported back to archdeacon lloyd there had been
 hastily covered with a beautiful emthe information was tabulated and sent to each broidered cloth and at the other end
 of the mom of the denominations concerned as there were was their most precious possession a milking quite a few
 scattered homesteads where young cow couples wanted to have anglican weddings the archdeacon decided he would have to make the
 during the meal the cow suddenly started to raise its tail lawks said the cockney s wife trip himself she
 rushed across the room picking up a bucket by the way edwards are there any people en mute and just
 caught the cow s muck which willing to put me up he asked dropped into the bucket with a resounding
 plop oh yes replied harold do stay with the plop it was put outside where it froze but in blanks
 they are most hospitable people the spring all the manure was dug into a little kit three weeks later the
 archdeacon came tramp chen garden which also had one border of ing into harold s shack edwards he said flowers
 the following summer the husband shaking his fist but grinning broadly i could managed to build a larger log house

 stewart wade and chief of police evans in their prompt action early in the morning of the second day of
 the fair in closing up all the gambling booths on the fair grounds without any instructions or solicitation on the
 part of the fair association magistrate wade and chief evans made a tour of inspection amongst the booths on the
 grounds and closed out all those having devices which turned in dollars unfairly into the operator s pockets that the
 operations on the grounds this year were made fair and open was made clear long before the great annual was

 00 shove attack on chinese a dispute arose between a white man and a chinaman both employees of the banif
 springs hotel last monday afternoon they were in each other s way and the chinaman said something objectionable to the
 white man who in his wrath struck the heathen in the face making his nose bleed and blackening one of
 his eyes within an hour after the assault the case was dealt with by the magistrate who fined the white
 man 5 and costs amounting in all to 8 the entry of this affair on the court books was the
 first of its kind in six months and the magistrate regretted that this white record had to be broken from
 the court s point of view the chinaman could not be held responsible for the offence because a man cannot
 be permitted to take the law in his own hands for the purpose of resenting an insult offered by a
 chinaman or any other kind of a man looking at the case from a purely moral point of view however
 the young man who committed the assault cannot suffer much discredit in public opinion about the first thing in english
 the chinaman learns is how to swear and use the terms that are used by some white man only when
 they mean to aggravate a fight the chinaman with a thorough understanding of the offensive effect of these epiteths is
 too much given to a free use of them and there does not seem to be written a law sufficiently
 susceptible to operation to chastise him properly for it it is worth remarking by the way that banif has been
 about the most peaceable village of its size in canada the whole place from the depot to the banif springs
 hotel is policed by one constable and on his efficiency there is considerable credit reflected whether or not the heathen
 was to blame for the breach of the peace it is a reasonable conclusion that had not the dozen or
 more chinamen been imported here the court records would yet be clean chinamen and white men do not mix any
