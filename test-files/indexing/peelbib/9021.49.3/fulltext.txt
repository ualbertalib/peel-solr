 domestic context alcohol induced boisterous behaviour followed by amnesia was not a defence to get a soldier absolved of all
 blame for his actions but drinking was nevertheless a vice to which most soldiers seemed to succumb in the summer
 of 1916 however provincial liquor laws became much less forgiving and completely altered the social fabric of the province 7
 the year before after an intense crusade prohibitionists had succeeded in convincing albertans to outlaw the devil s brew in
 a referendum vote the alberta temperance act came into force on 1 july 1916 still the consumption of alcohol was
 not eradicated as james gray noted there were enough loopholes left to enable a determined drunk to drink almost without
 pause while historians have been careful to stress that too few police were provided to enforce the temperance regulations 8
 there certainly were arrests and soldiers stationed in calgary soon perceived themselves to be an easy and unfair target in
 early october 1916 an employee of a downtown cabaret bar allegedly made an uncomplimentary remark to several patrons in khaki
 proclaiming that he was there to serve gentlemen and not soldiers the report quickly spread and several hundred soldiers gathered
 at the bar that night whooping and shouting derisively the chief of police showed up with as many officers as
 he could assemble as did the military police eventually the proprietor of the bar appeared in the middle of the
 street apologized for any wrongdoing and said he would do anything to avoid inciting trouble the crowd apparently satisfied marched
 off when a band of the kilties bagpipes blaring passed by 9 on ii october the seeds of a more
 serious disorder were sown at 11 00 am five men of the 211 th battalion were convicted by the police
 magistrate of calgary for offences under the liquor for those citizen soldiers who were undoubtedly at the crime scenes drunkenness
 appeared to have been an acceptable means of denying participation and of evading some responsibility for one s actions intoxication
 was a particularly common defence voiced at the inquiry into the riverside hotel incident for example private h h thompson
 of the 82 nd battalion was caught with a box of cigars that were obviously stolen from the hotel he
 claimed that a soldier gave these to him while he was under the influence of liquor private thomas howarth of
 the 56 th followed the crowd to the riverside after having had a half dozen drinks at the alberta hotel
 and was arrested for being drunk and disorderly like others who drank before the riot he said he remembered little
 of the evening s subsequent events 5 of course drunken disorderliness was an offence and some soldiers were convicted of
 crimes committed under the influence heavy drinking however has always been an element of army culture if official authorities demanded
 conformity to the regulations the informal relations between soldiers stressed quite the opposite tim cook in a recent article on

 police station were broken by a dummy cartridge and a stone sergeant c c campbell of the 211 th battalion
 the de fliclo spokesman for the soldiers demanded that some of his men go in and verify that the prisoners
 were indeed not in the building the chief constable agreed and two parties of three men proceeded to inspect the
 cells where they discovered that the men whom they sought were not there sergeant campbell then stomped upstairs to the
 chief secretary s office and telephoned the rnwmp barracks alleging to speak as a representative of the recruiting office he
 inquired as to whether any men from the 211 th were being detained in the barracks as soon as campbell
 received an affirmative reply he returned to the front steps he stepped up on a wall arch and leaning against
 a pillar about fourteen feet above the ground he proclaimed the prisoners real location to the crowd of soldiers 5
 the soldiers were told to fall in resumed their rough formation with bugles blowing and tramped along seventh avenue towards
 their new destination the rnwmp barracks an officer with the garrison military police tried to intervene but he was shouted
 down and his pleadings to disperse summarily discarded the crowd gathered on the lawn around the 4 th street entrance
 to the barracks they now included some two hundred civilians as well as about three hundred members of the 211
 th 218 th and 233 rd battalions several non commissioned military officers demanded the release of the prisoners amidst shouts
 of we want justice and our comrades are inside and we want to get them released inspector newson informed them
 that this would be impossible without a higher court order and promised to telephone a local judge he did so
 but the crowd did not wait for a response at about 8 45 pm some soldiers charged the east door
 and some succeeded in forcibly that the five men sentenced that morning be released one unidentified soldier addressed the crowd
 all of you who care anything for justice join us in getting these men out these men are brave soldiers
 and good citizens who have committed no crime they were not even accused of being drunk the only charge against
 them was that they smelled of liquor and for that they are treated as criminals and sent down for 30
 days do you call that justice these men have volunteered to fight for you some of them have crossed the
 border to fight for you people and is that the way they should be treated another added that it was
 a shame that a civilian could be had up fs r the same thing and only get a 5 00

 ncos had led the procession to the police station and rnwmp barracks sergeant campbell testified that he had taken no
 part in the attack and had tried to appeal to them about law and good order on the way to
 the barracks but it was useless he later helped with picquet duty but that should not obfuscate the fact that
 he had spurred the excited crowd to directed action earlier in the evening by announcing the location of the prisoners
 lance corporal webster was seen leading a sort of organized mob to the barracks in a somewhat more orderly fashion
 than a mere rabble of unguided individuals staff sergeant s r waugh of the rnwmp identified sergeant cohen of the
 218 th battalion as the chief agitator who stood on the steps yelling and shouting and all around the court
 of inquiry sent all thi ee ncos to civilian trial for being particularly blameworthy both by reason of their rank
 and the prominent part which they took in the riot nevertheless the military stressed that the attack was not premeditated
 but spontaneous and therefore they had little control over the actions of the men who happened to be in uniform
 however it was this lack of control that was the most damning indictment against the local officer corps an interesting
 if somewhat tangential issue to this topic involves the payment of compensation in other cases of soldier attacks and rioting
 across the country military officials strictly denied any legal responsibility for lawless behaviour it has always been the policy of
 the department not to recognize damages done by the soldiers in riots or otherwise the deputy minister of defence reported
 with the department disclaiming all responsibility for such actions on the part of the soldiers and leaving it to the
 victims to exercise their ordinary legal remedies in recovering damages although there was some concern that payment to the rnwmp
 could represent a dangerous precedent for claims made by the public the department of national defence never seriously considered withholding
 a compensation of nearly 800 from the mounted police the department of justice reported that as the loss is an
 incident to the war it might very well be repaired out of the war vote but whatever disposition be made
 of the matter i do not think it can affect cases like that of the canadian club at waterloo or
 white lunch restaurants and riverside hotel in calgaryl in which a private concern is preferring a claim against the government
 although this reasoning was never explained the rnwmp did indeed receive its compensation if the military s de jure responsibility
 for the soldiers recalcitrant behaviour remained questionable their payment of damages to the rnwmp was a defticto admission of guilt
 fortunately the attack on the rnwmp barracks was the last of the so called soldier riots in calgary during world

 sloughs gullies wet meadows and some arabic land broken by hills along the north side of the redwater river were
 high escarpments gouged by deep in 1908 settlers like my grandparents ravines which carried melt run offs into and their
 son joseph hoped to find the river heavy snowfalls and fm equent homesteads near a trading centre but rains fed
 the numerous streams which in were sorely disappointed the land in a turn helped to flood the river in spring
 radius of thirty to thirty five miles around edmonton was already claimed extreme variations in soil were hidden however the
 officials at the from human eyes by thick bush and a immigration office thm ough a ukrainian cover of sod
 the land varied from good interpreter assured them there was black loam to sandy loam gravel or plenty of land
 north of edmonton there clay gumbo covered by sod rocks was even talk of a railroad to be soon varied
 in size from till to cobbles to blmilt from edmonton to fort mcmumtay stones and boulders further to the west
 this was the northern alberta railway ran miles of sandhills unfit for fiuially built in 1912 in the end it
 was cultivation but rich in other natural probably the railway that convinced m esources like logs firewood fence rails them
 to look no further than rutherford and posts later renamed opal ten dollars down entitled my the new settlers were
 totally unaware of grandparents to homestead 160 acres of the harsh environment awaiting them hush with the stipulation they build
 a but upon arrival they found several other home clear amid cultivate thirty acres of families settling in this gave
 them more land within three years and build a confidence in their own choice having fence around the quarter only
 then picked out their homestead they set would they be able to get the title to the about to dig
 a well and build a shelter land it was a tall order no matter how one looked at it armed
 with little more a glacial dril t had crawled through this thami an axe a grubhoe a saw and a
 region of northern alberta thousamids of spade they built a small log cabin with a years ago unloading much of
 its debris sod roof to house the family and started over au extended area the affected clearing a patch for
 a garden from august to september whole families would go berry picking from sunday to thursday on friday the father
 of the family would take the berries by team and wagon to edmonton on saturday he would sell them at
 the public market alberta history i summer 2001 two years later when joseph reached on our way we had to
 cross a shaky the age of eighteen he applied for a corduroy over a quagmire before lie homestead next to
 his father s he built a horses were able to scramble up a steep small cabin with a sod roof
 then hill ahead it was a scary trip but we together with his father they started to made it on
 our m eturn trip father niade fence the two quarters and worked froni mother and us children get off the
 wagon dawn to dusk in between times joseph to walk down for safety s sake clinging would leave home to
 earn a few extra to mother s skirts we all cried watching dollars and in february of 1914 he the
 wagon rumbling down hill amid over married lena mandrusiak of waugh the rocking corduroy it would have been a major
 disaster had even one wheel i was born in december of the same slipped over the edge but luckily we
 all year mother told me how the sod roof made it home leaked that first summer and every time it
 rained she would push my cradle one late spring a heavy rain and snowunder the table to keep me dry
 when i melt occurred at the same time the was five years old father built a new redwater river unimpressive
 at the best two roomed log house with a shingled of times spilled over its banks and roof and several
 regular sized windows spread over the meadow until it looked a big change from a sod roof and one like
 one big river only a fringe of little i olmr paned window by this time willow tops marked its route
 the flood there were three small children so the turned the river into a monster tearing extra space must have
 been a blessing down trees and wrecking catwalks and a couple of wooden bridges along the way at five years
 of age i was beginning to water rushing down one of the ravines notice my surroundings we were not tore
 across the road leaving a gully allowed to wander away from the house twenty feet deep to this day there
 still which stood on a hill in those years it remains a scar as a reminder of what rained often
 in summer the dirt road which happened passed by the house ran downhill where it crossed a wet meadow and
 disappeared from sight after every heavy rain people living on the north side of the river found themselves cut off
 from opal where there was a store post office my first acquaintance with a corduroy school and other amenities to
 get road was when i saw men lay logs crosswise on the road that fall these across the river the
 settlers had to hlmild corduroy roads were repeated a log raft children who attended school throlmghout the district wherever the
 at opal had to walk an extra distance natural waterways cut across the road over a high ridge of land
 to reach the allowances during the twelve years the railroad trestle it took weeks before the settlers had been there
 there was little settler s life retlirned to normal improvement in the condition of the roads for a start they
 had little to work howevem the roads were not the only with they used a walking plow to make bad
 thing abolmt the district the soil the ditches and the local improvement itself lacked the qualities that would board provided
 a fresno scraper with have made it good farming land it handles it was drawn by a team and was
 varied from one quarter to another used to scrape the dirt off the hills to fm om black loam or
 sandy loam with cover the com dui oys as always it was a only a few rocks or none at
 all to the thamikless job working against nature next quarter which could be a hodge podge of sandy loam and
 glmmbo there hills and quagmires went hand in hand was one quarter along the road that in this country i
 i ememher the time we looked like someone had seeded it with went to visit niy grandparents at waugh till
 amid cobblestones ten dollars down entitled my grandparents to homestead 160 acres of bush with the stipulation they build a
 home clear and cultivate thirty acres of land within three years and build a fence around the quarter only then
 would they be able to get the title to the land alberta history i summer 2001 my father s land
 varied from loam to sandy loam with more than its share of stones every spring after cultivating the land there
 would be a new crop of stomies littering the fields he would come home dead beat after a day of
 picking rocks and say he was sure that the fields would grow a new crop next year the farm has
 changed hands several times since then and is pasturelamid now but the piles of rock remain in place as testament
 to his labours it took buckets of sweat and tears to bring the wilderness under control the area was heavily
 wooded so each individual poplar had to be cut down with an axe limbed and dragged into piles to be
 burned later stumps had to be grubbed out and added to the piles after the land was broken by plow
 roots had to be picked piled and burned it is hard to imagine the hardship suffered by the homesteaders so
 they could lay claim to a scrap of land that they could call their own to the west and north
 of opal lay miles of sandhills unfit for cultivation but nonetheless rich in natural resources old growth jackpines green spruce
 tamarac and birch were there for the taking spruce logs were used for buildings jackpines for firewood tamarac for fence
 rails and swamp spruce for posts homesteaders kept helping themselves to whatever they needed until the government finally put a
 stop to it by requiring them to buy permits however it was now already too late to save the old
 growth woods from the settler s axe i learned to love the sandhills at an early age whemi i accompanied
 my grandmother there on her berry picking trips fromii her i learned where to look for the best berries and
 which mushrooms were good to pick and which were to be left alone i also listened to her stories about
 life in the old country when she was a little girl a day in the woods with grandmother was a
 day of pleasure with squirrels chattering in the pine trees and hawks screeching as they wheeled about in the sky
 we usually shared our lunch with two or three bluejays which appeared as soon as we started eating they seemed
 to have no fear of humans their sharp eyes never missing a crumb our lunch was simple fresh home made
 bread generously buttered and eaten with handfuls of bemties freshly picked it was a feast good enough for the gods
 at day s end tired but happy i would have a bucketful of blueberries plus a bagful of the choicest
 mushrooms to take home besides the blueberries there were a variety of other berries in the sandhills cranberries grew in
 muskegs as well as on forest floors pin cherries chokecherries and fat juicy saskatoons draped the hillsides there were red
 and black currants wild raspbemties and dew berries as well as woodland strawberries all to be found only in certain
 places in the fall the acrid aroma of high bush cranberries floated over the sandhills for miles letting everybody know
 they were ready for picking from august to september whole families would go berry picking from sunday to thursday on
 friday the father of the family would take the berries by team and wagon to edmonton on saturday he would

 blueberry times were still hard but nothing to fifty dollars and every penny helped to compared to what they had

 two former ridges the general direction is nearly the same here i lefi my horses the first range is so
 named because it is the first true range of the rocky mountains 4 in cree rocky mountains is asiny waciy

 ea alberta history summer 2001 the time mcgillivray reaches the brazeau lake area he knows that he is near the
 divide between the brazeau and athabasca rivers not the columbia it is likely that through his guide that he kmiew
 this before hamid and that part of the pui pose for this reconnaissance was to confirm this item of geography
 his route from the nordegg area to the brazeau river roughly follows what came to be known as the bighorn
 trail this forestry trail was the major northsouth trunk route between hinton and the north saskatchewan river where it connected
 with the morley trail 7 many forestry trails were upgraded versions of older established travel routes the fact that this
 major travel corridor was known to mcgillivray s native guide should come as no surprise mcgillivray s choice of the
 wapiabi gap to pass through the bighorn range is somewhat surprising from north to south his guide had three choices
 chungo blackstone and wapiabi gaps the length of north west travel and overall route description points to the southernmost gap
 as the omie chosen though the most direct route fromii nordegg to the brazeau is by way of the middle
 blackstone gap the route choice may have been inflmmenced by local trail conditions or the presence of the cree camp
 along the wapiabi if they knew beforehand that the camp was there the concept of a native trail is a
 misnomer travel corridor would be a miiore precise dcscription low population density and limited technology meant that many 18 th
 century travel routes were not as significant a mark on the landscape as they are today travel corridors may include
 a network of several trails all roughly going in the same direction a large forest tire and subsequent brulé 0:brule may
 close one route and force travellers to select another urmimpacted option in this context mcgillivray s zmpproaclm route to nordegg
 becomes very interesting rather than following time course of the north saskatchewan river he swings north to the baptiste which
 he ascends to the shunda gap the reason above top for his route choice can be found in an vien

 2001 warm welcome and a night s lodging from the hospitable owner the old logs now weather beaten and moth
 eaten had come from the banks of the red deer river some six miles to the westward and had been
 rough hewn by an original settler into a pioneer home since that time many people had been born lived and
 died in it our own buildings were erected on the opposite side of the coulee for many years we looked
 upon the old log house as a eye sore and planned to burn it down it was in such a
 state of disrepair and so infected with vermin that it was impossible to use it either for storage purposes or
 for lirewood yet some kind of sentiment prevented us from tackling the job and it was left for almost ten
 years after we arrived in its original site at last we decided that rmot only must the place be demolished
 as an eye sore but that we needed the land it stood upon in order to square off one of
 our best fields we chose a cool day and set out to burn it down the land on either side
 of the house was sunimerfallow and perfectly safe as an extra precaution however we plowed a guard all around it
 in front it was further protected by the prairie bank which although lush with grass led down to a lively
 streamil when everything was ready one of the men climbed on the roof and poured a can of gasoline over
 it a match was set to this and in a few seconds the ancient lumber had sprung into flame almost
 immediately there was a tremendous roaring and crackling and it was not long before the entire roof fell in and
 the place wemit up like a gigantic bonfire in less than half an hour the old log house was reduced
 to a ruin of smoulderimig ashes then the men who had attended to the job turmied their backs upon it

 carried them up on to some plowed land a good distance away from the house there i left them in

 the coulee s edge the tractor plowed up and down the driver almost blinded by smoke and flame as the
 fire swept about the wheels of the engine men with soaking sacks ran back and forth from the pump house
 which ran a steady stm eam of water into tubs and pails it was my job to keep the sacks
 soaking wet for the men as they came back and forth for fresh ones neighbours seeing the clouds of smoke
 fm om afar came hurrying over to help us there was soon a gang of some twenty to thirty all
 working without thought of self even the women joined in fight thanks to the efforts of these gallant people the
 fire was at last conqlmered and our buildings saved nothing was damaged although the fire came within a few feet
 of the barn itself for several days and nights thereafter however we feared to leave the coulee unprotected men watched
 it day and night against some unexpected outbmeak the big mass of manum e still smouldered despite all our efforts
 and no amount of water seemed to have any effect omi it for weeks af terwards we were forced regularly
 to turn it over pour water on it and pack it down with dirt even then we did not feel
 really safe about it till the frost came i have often looked across at the bare spot where the old
 log house used to stamid amid wondered if perhaps old houses have souls it has sometimiies seemed to mc that
 the old log house or the soul of the old log house was takimig revenge on us for burning it

 1931 during the meal i happened to look out of the kitchen window and noticed that a namtow line of
 flame was creeping down the coulee bamik in front of the smouldering pile somehow or other the fire had jumped
 the fil eglmard and was now beginning to advamice in a rapidly spreading line down the bank i called the
 men but they assured me that it was all right simice once the fire reached the bottom it would be
 extinguished by the stream howevem they went out to keep an eye on it well for us that they did
 somewhere along the coulee at a spot where the stream was miarrowest and the bushes on either side very close
 and thick against the water s edge the fire leaped across perhaps it was just one flying flaming twig whatever
 it was it was sufficient to set the further side our own side ablaze with flame on this side too
 there was no plowed lamid or sunimerfallow to act as a protection against its approach our buildings stood close upon
 the couhee s edge amid there were many of them if the fire could not be controlled there was little
 hope of saving anything leaping curling cackling roaring on came the fire licking up the coarse dry grass and sweeping
 nearer and nearer to the top forcing the men who were fighting it ever up and back on the edge
