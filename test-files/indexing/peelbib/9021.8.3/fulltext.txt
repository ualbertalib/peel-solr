 in the pioneer writing competition o the society during the year 1911 the department of interior decided to carry out
 an aggressive campaign to induce settlement in the great peace river country heavy advertising was done in newspapers and periodicals
 brochures distributed through boards of trade and colonization agents placed in strategic spots in the central and northern united states
 and in the older settled parts of canada furthermore the grand trunk pacific railway which was then pushing its transcontinental
 line westward had surveyed a branch line from edson via what is now whitecourt northwesterly into grande prairie and was
 advertising edson far and wide as the gateway to the last great west the government also commencing the cutting out
 of a colonization road from e d s o n to grande prairie a distance of about two hundred and
 fifty miles the old route over which a very few late in february we took the hotel bus settlers had
 previously gone into the which was horse drawn over the low country ran from edmonton north to level bridge and
 stayed at the yale athabasca landing then westerly along hotel overnight the next morning we lesser slave lake and on
 to peace river took the g t p train for edson and had crossing and then south via dunvegan quite
 a slow trip out as westward from this was a distance of six hundred miles entwistle it was still in
 the hands of and practically impossible in the sum the construction department mer months the great lure was free virgin

 and also half breed scrip which was then the end of the steel and on the open market and applying
 it to a rip roaring wide open frontier camp crown lands this place later became the junction for the alberta
 coal branch there he pur the writer who only the previous chased a sleigh and a team of huge summer
 had come out from old ontario oxen and a dark red and the other blue to weyburn saskatchewan as a
 young and white which he insisted was paul graduate pharmacist of only twenty one bunyan s blue ox of storied
 fame in summers again felt the call of the west the lumber woods of michigan and mm forming a partnership
 with a doctor r nesota in edson we secured a site for n bob shaw and an elmer davidson a
 small cache in which we left our a well experienced man of many ac trunks with such personal belongings as
 complishments having been lumberman we did not wish to take on the trail we farmer thresherman etc we entrained gathered
 an outfit together consisting for edmonton and arrived in strathcona of baled hay and grain for the oxen a small
 stove food for ourselves mostly the cold bracing air and hard exercise staples flour beans rice baking gave us wonderful
 appetites so no one powder salt sugar tea and coffee and suffered or complained even the doctor fat salt pork
 commonly called sow who on the start had been picking out belly cooking utensils and some medi the bits of
 fat from the good side bacon cines and first aid supplies and tools which we had then was munching down
 the fat sow belly without a tremor we left edson on march 5 th 1911 being the first outfit to
 leave for grande some forty odd miles out of edson prairie just as we were leaving some where the high
 land makes its first break one snapped a picture of us and we were down to the benches of the
 athabasca more or less immortalized by the sale valley we encountered a very steep deof thousands of post cards of
 the picture clivity later known as break neck hill and it later became one of the illustra in order to
 negotiate this in safety we tions in a book which was written by an wrapped several log chains around the
 anglican missionary stationed at edson runners of our sleigh we then chopped we had been assured by the local board
 down a jackpine tree about thirty feet of trade that although the trail was not tall cut off all the
 branches about fifteen quite all cut out it undoubtedly would inches from the trunk so that they would be by
 the time that we got up there and dig in well and chained the top of it to that we
 should encounter no particular the rear of our loaded sleigh so as to difficulties hold it back from over running
 the oxen we continued on across the athabasca we encountered many varied experi on the ice and on across the
 little smoky ences on that trail but space will permit river of the setting down of only a few of
 them here travelling by ox team is a rather a couple of days later we met the slow and tedious
 business we usually road foreman sides who with his crew walked except for the one driving and was hurrying back
 to edson before the probably averaged not more than ice would go out as there was as yet twenty miles
 a day each night we no ferry on the river he assured us howcooked up a meal fed our oxen
 cut ever that foreman woodward was cutspruce boughs to make a bed at the ting through from the other end
 and that rear end of our sleigh set a couple of if we would camp at the end of the
 poles up leaning on the sleigh threw a cutting when we reached it we would tarpaulin over them to make
 an impro have only a few days to wait as there vised tent and slept there for the night were
 only a very few miles left to be the temperatures usually went down cut we learned later however that well
 towards zero during the night and woodward with his crew was hurrying sometimes even below so it was not too
 out just as fast in the other direction pleasant when we were not inured to it water for cooking was
 melted snow and when we arrived at the end of the cutthat winter the rabbits were almost as ting we
 found a cree half breed named thick as flies with their trails criss cross larocque and a north carolinian school
 ing all over the woods we would pick teacher who had purchased supplies out what we fondly thought was some
 from the camp and stayed behind and nice clean snow to melt for our coffee whom we promptly named sam
 mcor other requirements but when it was gee we learned later that he had melted we found at least a
 few rabbit stayed around there for a few months berries floating around on the top we panning some gold out
 of the streams would then pitch it out and get some and going down to edson with his sammore but
 with the same results so after ples he had induced several citizens to a few trials we stoically skimmed them
 put up money for a gold staking venture off and used the water the bread soon ran out and flapjacks
 and bannock took the next day an old sourdough of the its place sometimes these did not turn trail of
 ninety eight pulled into our out too well being somewhat under camp with a sleigh and team of small cooked
 and they would be facetiously oxen a day or two later three amen ieferred to as dough gods however cans
 arrived with two sleighs and a bunch of loose cayuses they were from the sheltered woods this being now montana
 one being a sheepherder one late in march the snow was fairly soft a cowboy and the other a very
 talk although crusted on top by the bright ative gentleman of unknown talents and sunshine and each step we took
 it called b s smith some of us hired would support our foot until we really larocque to make a
 trip up to sturgeon put our weight on it when down we lake to see if we could arrange to
 pur would sink so that every night we were chase hay for our livestock at sturgeon soaked to the skin
 after eating we built lake the hudson s bay company and huge camp fires stripped to the skin revillon freres
 each maintained a trad put on dry clothing from our bags and ing post there was also a roman cath
 after drying our wet clothing rolled it in olic mission school and church and num our bags for a change
 next night we erous indian log dwellings he returned then rolled up in our blankets spread on in about a
 week and reported that there a bed of spruce b o u g h s and slept was no hay
 at all to be had and further soundly until we heard the cook s call that there was about sixty
 miles of bush early next morning the rest of the landto cut through before we reached there seekers followed us
 at their leisure with we did not believe him at the time but the animals and outfits this same found
 out later that it was too true routine went on day after day we picked up the dog sled trail
 from lac several more landseekers arrived ste ann to sturgeon lake and followed within the next week with various out
 it for many miles this ran along the fits and then the government road en westerly side of house river
 waskagineer a h mcquarrie arrived on the higan being the indian name across scene he organized a government road numerous
 very deep ravines where the crew of all those who were able and creeks ran down to the river but
 early willing to cut trail a cook sleigh was in the summer the route was resurveyed readied with a stove
 and supplies with and changed to the east side of the river a cook in charge this sleigh also carried
 where the terrain was much flatter the workers dunnage or war bags containing our blankets and a change of several
 amusing incidents occurred clothing this sleigh kept right along during the cutting operations there was with us as we progressed
 served our setting out on the edson grande prairie trail midday meal and supper where we the author and his
 party had their sleigh piled halted for the night along at this point high with belongings left to right are
 harvey we worked through a belt of very heavy switzer dr h shaw and e davidson theirs was the first
 outfit to leave for grande prairie snow there being more than five feet in this photo was taken in edson
 in 1911 no large timber most of the trees being knew that country like the palm of his poplar with
 the largest probably six or hand and who spoke cree fluently bareight inches nevertheless we would gained with the senior
 indian chief more or less continuously hear the cry red moose for the only hay in sturof timber ring out
 on the clear air geon lake five bales in order to get it one of the party had a dollar
 watch however he had to hire red moose as which stopped every few hours and a guide to take them
 over to the big several times each day he would draw smoky river he said later that they it from
 his pocket look at it intently did not need a guide any more than a and shout what time is
 it one night wagon needs a fifth wheel but they did while drying out our clothing one of the need
 the hay party had built his fire at the base of a spruce tree which was covered with a the
 next morning they set out with considerable amount of gum and hung their team and wagon there had as his
 pants to dry from a branch when the yet been no trail cut through but the fire got going well
 the spruce gum country was fairly open a great deal caught alight the fire went up the tree of it
 having been burnt over and there with a roar and the pants bellied out was a lot of beaver meadow
 country like a balloon later the owner was seen for mile after mile we followed beaver raking among the ashes
 and leaves to meadows crossing over narrow timrecover the pocket knife coins etc bared ridges from one to another there
 which had been in the pockets must have been hundreds of thousands of beaver taken out of that country in
 when we finally won through to the the early days end of the old cutting several miles south of sturgeon
 lake the crew was disband we followed their trail all day long ad it was now well on into april
 and as and arrived late at night on the simmonnone of the outfits had sufficient fodder ette river where we
 stopped near an along with them many of the animals indian encampment there in spite of had died enroute most
 of those which barking dogs and noises typical of an survived except those able to travel indian village we slept
 soundly until were driven onto the flats of the little late the next morning being tired out smoky where there
 was considerable from our hard hike of the previous day frozen grass filling but not very nour we again followed
 the wagon trail and ishing we had lost our blue ox and put early in the afternoon reached the brow
 the red ox on the river with the others of the big smoky valley near bezanson we found that the
 party had already we built a cache of poplar logs and been down to the river cornwall had placed in
 it our sleigh and all our gear crossed over on the ice and back again with the exception of what
 we would but by the time they reached the top carry on our backs for the rest of the of
 the valley the ice had already broken journey this included our blankets fry and was running in the stream as
 there ing pan tin plate and cup cutlery some was no way of crossing there we went grup and a
 hand axe about the time downstream a couple of miles to where we were ready to start off along came
 the two goodwin brothers had a camp a spanking team of horses with john afterwards known as goodwin s cross
 stocks deputy minister of public works ing we stayed with them a couple of jim cornwall the apostle of the
 north days until the ice running in the river and road engineer macquarrie the thinned out somewhat when they took
 team was driven by a young man named us across in a row boat robertson then an engineer in the
 department later i believe becoming we again took up our trail for the deputy minister they were on an in
 maca of grande prairie after ascendspection trip of the new road ing the western banks of the big smoky valley
 the land levelled out but all we caught up with them that night around the outer edge was bush and
 at sturgeon lake and visited with them scrub gradually thinning out towards in the home of the factor of the
 hudson s the centre with various sized patches of bay trading post jim cornwall who scrub giving the country a
 park like appearance while the very central part of the prairie was pretty well bare of scrub except for a
 little along the water courses this was now well along in april and the snow was melting fast all one
 morning we slogged through water up to our ankles and at times to our knees through what was known as
 the red willow flats this was in later years all drained off into the smoky as a government project and
 the land all s a t t 1 e d that evening we reached bear creek where a man by
 the name of bredin had a stopping place this later became the site of grand prairie city the next day
 we hiked over to the trading post at lake saskatoon at the west end of the lake where there was
 quite a little village outside of this place there were very few people in the whole grande prairie country just
 a comparatively few settlers who had come in a few years before by the long trail a few around bear
 lake a few over at beaverlodge and red willow and two or three at buffalo lakes were about all the
 final cutting operations on the edson grande prairie trail in 1911 were supervised by a government crew here j d
 robertson and a h mcquarrie from the department of public works and james cornwall right member of the legislature are
 camped on the trail in april along with us when we got to the little smoky river crossing we found
 it in full flood with the swollen waters running almost to the top of its banks there was a dugout
 which travellers used but it was on the opposite shore so we went to work with our hand axe and
 cut logs from a pile of driftwood lashed them together with the ropes from our packs cut out two steering
 paddles loaded our packs on the raft and started across the doctor being inexperienced headed the raft downstream for the
 opposite bank so it was a little while before i could exert my own paddle enough to swing us upstream
 so that the current carried us over albeit a distance downstream we made camp there for the night and very
 early the next morning we awaked with rain coming down on us we got up before our blankets got too
 wet cooked breakfast and started off the rain continued more or less all day and it was not long before
 the water was trickling off the bottom of our packs cmd down our legs just at evening we arrived at
 the next morning we replenished our grub supply and started out looking for suitable land on which to file we
 spent approximately the next week running cut lines taking the section numbers from the iron survey stakes in the corner
 mounds of quarters that took our fancy we slept out on the prairie at night and and sometimes it was
 pretty cold it being late in april we would awaken with the sun in the morning and the white hoar
 frost covering the blankets all around our heads to show that we chose wisely in the selection of land it
 was mostly all in the area in which the town of sexsmith was later established and which became the largest
 primary grain shipping point in the british empire some weeks later when the land rush developed in earnest the government
 established a sub land office but at that time the closest place at which we could file homestead entries was
 grouard at the west end of lesser slave lake some seventy five miles north of sturgeon lake so we headed
 back for sturgeon lake and from there took the winter trail for grouard the first day out we met another
 man on a similar errand who then travelled west prairie river opposite a home patent flour bought from incoming setsteader
 s log shack and found a small tlers brought 16 sugar was 20 per boat there as it would not
 hold us all cwt beans 24 for 120 pound bag and and our packs we had to make two salt
 pork 40 we augmented our salt trips the doctor was in the first load and pork with the odd rabbit
 or wild chicken having the paddle did the same as with as well as dried moose meat and bear the
 raft so it was almost a half mile meat from the indians at rare times we downstream before he reached
 the other were able to buy fresh moose meat from side then the boat had to be pulled la the
 indians but it would always be boriously upstream again by means of a bony front quarter meat as they dried
 rope we were pretty well played the better cuts once we were able to out when we were all finally
 across and buy two sacks of potatoes which was soaked through the new indian moe all the fresh vegetables we
 had all casins which i had donned that morn summer one day one of the crew shot ing were worn
 right through a year old bear which was a welcome change in our diet the homesteader was very hospitable so
 we were able to have a hot meal our crew varied from seven or eight get dried out and have
 a good sleep men to a high of twenty seven dr shaw where it was dry and warm the next
 worked on the crew for a short time and morning we set off for grouard where then he relieved the
 factor of revillon we filed on our land and set off on our freres trading post who went out on
 a return journey to sturgeon lake where holiday during the summer we worked we arrived in good time at several
 locations from our starting point right through to the west bank of as i stated previously davidson was the big
 smoky and part way back again a well experienced man and the road when we moved camp we loaded engineer
 had arranged for him to be everything on the wagon hooked the foreman of a road gang when we returned
 so we then started south to oxen up two and two with the big red ox on the lead and
 i drove them to our where we had cached our belongings next camp davidson began hiring some men from the
 settlers coming up the trail some of whom were willing to work for a few situated as we were we
 had a ringweeks before continuing on their way side seat on the great tide of land i was taken on
 as cook it being the best seekers flowing into the country there paying job next to that of the foreman
 were people from every part of canada we recovered our big red ox and he and the united states and
 from every bought two more teams to work oxen walk of life farmers ranchers laborers being much more suitable than
 horses school teachers doctors and lawyers for the work we had to do there was and the outfits were just
 as varied one none of today s heavy road machinery man might have nothing but his pack we had a
 plough a slip scraper another a single wagon drawn by horses shovels axes and grub hoes we did or oxen
 and another outfit would consist ditching laid corduroy built small of several wagons loaded with farm bridges and on very
 steep hills did some machinery and supplies of all kinds side hill grading one party we remembered particularly consisted of
 two school teachers married our food was good but simple and not to two school teachers quite young too much
 variety we drew our supplies couples having come from the city of from the trading post and there were no
 vancouver tinned fruits fresh vegetables or other luxuries we had tinned jam butter in the trail was hard and wearisome
 two pound tins dried fruits in 25 pound and for some almost heartbreaking wooden boxes desicated vegetables in wagons would
 become bogged down five and seven pound sealed tins and in the mud mosquitoes in swarms worother staples prices were
 very high but ned both man and beast and for a perof course freight was seven cents a iod of
 six weeks it rained at some time pound which had to be added to every in the day every day
 but all were thing trade flour was 12 per cwt high imbued with the hope of a new home in
 a new land and pressed on in spite of all hardships with freeze up about the end of october road
 work ceased and camp was broken up about this time we dissolved our partnership dr shaw became dissatisfied and davidson
 although not saying anything was not too happy about the way some things were working out so we got together
 and made a final settlement of our mutual affairs dr shaw stayed in grande prairie where he practiced medicine and
 later at sexsmith until his untimely death elmer davidson stayed in the country and started a cattle ranch at watino
 where the railway crosses the big smoky and was quite successful the author was passed on the trail by the
 government party but caught up with them at sturgeon lake where they bartered with the indians for hay in this
 group at the lake are john stocks deputy minister of public works at left and a h mcquarrie centre early
 in the fall one of my brothers had joined our crew and when camp broke up we decided to take
 a trip around the prairie before going back to edson as we planned to visit relatives in b c over
 christmas so we started off and took another look at the land on which we had filed one of the
 quarters being in his name game birds were very plentiful the prairie chickens were gathering into flocks for the fall
 and we often saw flocks of two or three hundred birds there were hundreds of geese and literally thousands of
 ducks at one place known as the twin lakes one of these now being at clairmont and the other fairly
 well dried up ducks and geese were constantly flying in huge flocks from one lake to the other however the
 greatest wonder to me was the way the prairie had been settled in that one summer in the spring the
 whole prairie was open and unsettled and in the fall it was dotted in every direction with log shacks and
 little pieces of breaking i also found that during the summer a new town grande prairie city had been staked
 out although there was not as yet a single building erected on the site i had to go over to
 lake saskatoon to visit the bank so i went by myself and stayed overnight i left there early the next
 morning and took a short cut across the lake which was then frozen over solid when i was well out
 on the ice i heard from the direction of some bush on the one shore the most unearthly sounds that
 i had ever heard i thought that all the devils in hell had been let loose and my heart flopped
 over a couple of times and almost stopped however i soon recovered when a band of five coyotes trotted out
 on to the ice they having been responsible for all the noise i joined my brother at bear creek and
 we started on our return journey to edson by this time ci number of stopping places had been established along
 the trail these were usually situated near a stream to assure a water supply the owner supplied a fairly large
 room furnished with a cook stove a table or two and a few benches for a small fee one could
 use the facilities cooking their own food or could buy a meal for themselves and also for their animals if
 needed they were usually designated swamp with trees about twenty or by the mileage from edson or the name twenty
 five feet high which made it of the party who operated it and some pretty dark on the narrow trail
 it had times by both been cut through the previous winter when snow was on the ground so the stumps
 were quite high and on these at sturgeon lake we met up with we stubbed our moccasin clad toes as
 three other men who were returning to we struggled along we reached the edson on foot and travelled with them
 stopping place which was run by two the longest stretch at that time on which men about 9 30 p
 m they had shot a there were no stopping places was from moose that day and soon had steaks sturgeon
 lake to tony river a distance frying on the stove never in our lives of seventy five or eighty miles
 the first had we smelled anything so absolutely night out we made camp at moose delicious and we did full
 justice to them creek the weather had turned bitterly cold going down to 35 below zero so we spent a
 very uncomfortable night the next night we stopped at mile 35 we built up a huge fire and one of
 us the scotchman s place here we artook turns at keeping it burning through ranged with a man who was
 returning out the night the following night we to edson with a team and empty sleigh camped in fairly open
 poplar country to take our packs so that we could travel near house river but the temperature light we were
 in top notch physical had risen some and we did not fare too condition and could walk four miles an
 badly the next day at around two hour for hour after hour we arrived at o clock we arrived on
 the hillside above mile 20 the frenchman s about 11 30 the tony river stopping place we a m but
 had to wait for dinner to be cooked up all the remainder of our grub gotten ready so that it
 was 1 00 p m and lazed around camp for the after before we got away and we made noon
 we planned that we would buy edson at about 5 15 p m tired but our supper there and stay
 for the night happy around five o clock we walked down to the stopping place and found the wife and
 children of the owner who told us we then took the train for revelstoke that she could not possibly feed
 us as b c where we visited with relatives her husband had gone down to edson over christmas right after
 new year s for supplies and as she was not sure i returned alone to edson my brother when he
 would return she could not remaining behind after several advenspare a bit of food of any kind tures which could
 form the basis for another story i decided not to return to grande prairie but located at edson the next
 stopping place was at little i opened a drug store there in january smoky river about twelve miles further 1912
 which i have operated continuon so there was nothing else to do but ously since that time on occasion when
 head for there it was past six by the meeting old timers in town or in the time we got
 started and darkness would peace river country the edson grande be coming very soon the last few miles prairie trail
 furnishes food for many the trail wound through a big spruce reminiscences of those bygone days police patrol cpl lauder
 and a detachment of 10 men returned from a scouting expedition on the 26 th they had been as far
 as milk river in search of a band of american whiskey traders who had been trading with our indians but
 did not succeed in finding either whiskey traders or indians fort macleod gazette sept 4 1882 an opinion of the
 frog lake massacre by rev dr edward ahenakew with foreward by alex e peterson a cree indian well known in
 the religious and educational life of western canada and an outstanding figure in the anglican church is the rev dr
 edward ahenakew born in 1885 on the sandy lake reserve near prince albert sask he attended the local day school
 there at the age of eleven he was admitted to the prince albert boarding school where he completed his high
 school training with distinction after two years study at wycliffe college toronto he returned west to complete his course in
 theology at emmanuel college saskatoon graduating in 1910 with the degree of l th it is interesting to note here
 that dr w everard edmonds for many years president of the historical society of alberta and past editor of this
 magazine was at this time a professor at emmanuel and one of mr ahenakew s teachers following his ordination to
 the priesthood rev ahenakew was appointed a travelling missionary to many scattered indian and white settlements in northern saskatchewan in
 his travels he found the general health and living conditions of his people deplorable and to assist in alleviating these
 conditions he felt that a knowledge of medicine was essential to his work to this end and with a view
 to obtaining his m d degree he entered the university of alberta as a student in the faculty of medicine
 unfortunately ill health prevented him from completing the course and so at the end of the third year he returned
 to the mission field in 1923 he was appointed general indian missionary diocese of saskatchewan but his ability as a
 preacher also took him to many other parts of canada in collaboration with archdeacon faries he edited a cree dictionary
 and for over thirty years published in syllabics the cree monthly guide in recognition of his outstanding services to the
 church and the indians of canada emmanuel college in 1947 conferred upon him the degree of doctor of divinity now
 at the age of 75 and after almost fifty years as an active clergyman and student missionary he is living
 in semi retirement cit fort a la come sask the frog lake indian mission came under the jurisdiction of dr
 ahenakew and in my position as the reserve overseer and day school teacher it was my pleasure to know and
 work with him for close to twenty years during this time i found him to be a most faithful and
 dedicated worker in the cause of christianity in all matters pertaining to the general well being of his people he
 was always to the fore and he never lost an opportunity to speak on their behalf one such opportunity came
 in june 1931 at the frog lake massacre grounds where a memorial was unveiled in honor of those killed there
 in the riel rebellion of 1885 present at this ceremony in addition to dr ahenakew were judge howay of new
 westminster professor morton of the university of saskatchewan w b cameron the lone white man to survive the massacre and
 several hundred indian and white people who came to pay their respects the program in addition to the many excellent
 speeches included sporting events and a sing song appropriate to the occasion my class of indian school children sang stand
 up stand up for jesus and jesus loves me this i know but the highlight of this memorable event was
 the address of dr ahenakew published here for the first time this remarkable and thought provoking address sets out the
 indians defence against the generally accepted causes which led to this painful episode in our history standing upon a rock
 overlooking the site of that awful deed he interpreted in no uncertain manner the indian mind his forceful but sincere
 speech left a deep impression on everyone present many of whom had come long distances to commemorate this tragic event
 alex e peterson the story of the 1885 massacre of the white men at frog lake is not so far
 removed from the past as to make it impossible for one to obtain an authentic account of what really did
 happen on that unfortunate day many are still alive who were present and were eyewitnesses of the happening some of
 course may have done a little more than merely look on but that need not be pried into unnecessarily at
 this late date since the government undertook at that time a most thorough investigation and the indians who took active
 part were all brought to judgment it is true the indian versions of the story vary somewhat as to detail
 but it is only natural that this should be so since the events happened so quickly and not all at
 the same place besides excitement was so intense that much is liable to have escaped the notice of some men
 after carefully listening to different eye witnesses among the indians putting what they told together eradicating all that does not
 seem to fit in with the most probable and true line of the story making due allowance for any natural
 accretions i feel that i have ci very reliable account of the event as it is remembered by the indians
 often when i drive through the place of massacre and see the eight mounds with their black iron crosses marking
 the place of repose of those killed on that unfortunate day i feel sorry that such a thing did ever
 happen but because i ki ow the crees i do not put it down to mere blood thirstiness i know
 that in his own way of thinking the indian man felt himself provoked to it he had been used to
 shooting his hereditary enemy the blackfoot at sight because if he did not he would get a bullet himself the
 feud had been between the two ever since nobody knows when but anyone who was not an enemy was ordinarily
 safe with him despite the fact that there was no law there had been very few murders committed among the
 crees so few that with them the eighth commandment was almost unnecessary so while i allow that the massacre is
 a sad blot on our history and i certainly am not aiming to justify it i feel that i should
 mention what extenuating circumstances there may have been rev edward ahenakew has long been known as a qualified and sympathetic
 speaker on behalf of his people he is seen here in front of his church in 1957 so as i
 drive past i think about the events of 1885 at frog lake i think of the blood that was shed
 not in cold murder but in the heat of a great excitement i imagine that i can see that great
 camp hear the tom tom of the drums at a dance at night which lasts till morning and then the
 fatal shots the sun certainly rose on a sad spectacle you ask me replied a step son of big bear
 to my questions i will tell you it might never have happened had it not been for some of our
 band from the southern plains blood was spilled and it darkened the sod of the frog lake reserve and christianity
 only can ever heal the wound made imagine a people who had lived and roamed over this great northwestern land
 breathing in the freedom of the prairie at every breath their will never called into question kept within bounds only
 by the teaching and exhortations of the old men of the nation knowing most exactingly the ways of the country
 skil i ul in all things pertaining to the making indian of those days it is said that the of
 a livelihood conquering the neces liberal distribution of money and the sarily hard conditions under which they consequent easy buying
 of so many lived feeling manhood that coursed things in the hudson s bay co posts through their physical bodies
 such a made such a pleasing impression on the people must love freedom as their god people that even the
 feelings of the disgiven animal the noble bison did they senters were temporarily mollified must resent anything that tended to
 bring that freedom to nought or even in any case they failed at the time to restrict it it is
 only nature it were to realize what signing over the land unnatural if it were not so was to mean
 in the future they did not here we will digress and consider think that it would have an adverse the
 hudson s bay co during their psychological effect on them they did regime they knew the indian it was not
 know that they were totally unto their own interest to be respected by fitted by previous habits for a settled
 the various bands and at the same time agricultural life how were they to realto be friendly with them they
 took a ize that it meant the continued applicarough paternal interest in them and they tion of mind and body
 to their work if kept good order and as far as it was they were to succeed and that such
 a possible peace for a long time today life would be just a reverse to their prethey are respected and
 liked by the vious one they did not realize that there indians was henceforth to be a definite systematized code
 of laws which would act then the government of canada took like a fence around their spirits within hold of
 the west it made treaties with certain limits though they were a tolerthe indians whereby the latter gave up ably
 good living people they felt this the whole land with the exception of unusual limitation and they resented it tracts
 here and there that were reserved and wherein they could settled down as years went by they felt this everand
 become farmers that may sound tightening hold of the law and as the easy enough but for a people who
 had government kept pulling in the reins of been nomadic for goodness only knows control the indians began to realize
 how many thousands of years to settle many things not anticipated when the down to an agricultural life meant the
 treaty was made complete reversal of those habits which had been bred into them by their former it was not
 only the laws that were modes of life also remember that in seemingly limiting their freedom white those days farming
 meant something people were coming in and introducing different from what it does today there other customs and modes the
 moral were no towns or railroads there was force of a superior civilization was not much equipment there were no
 steadily but surely asserting itself and houses to speak of apart from those in easily pushing aside their own ways
 of the few settlements it is easy to see life they began to see that in their own that the
 indian would be discontented native land where their will had always and look back with longing eyes to the been
 law that they were slowly becomdays when everything came readily to ing just a race of on lookers the day
 his hand and that feeling would be was surely dawning when they would lodged within him awaiting to be be
 ignored altogether and would have brought to a head by anything provoca to sit as silent as their women folk
 did tive that was liable to happen in the councils of men then again although there were not the times
 were hard even though the so many actually dissenting voices government helped much the buffalo worthy of notice many were
 not in were disappearing and somehow this agreement with the treaty made with circumstance linked itself in the indian the
 crown the righteousness or other mind with the advent of the white man wise of this i am not discussing
 i am merely putting things down as they i being an indian can understand all appeared to the untrained mind
 of the this i do not say that the indian was justified in these feelings but i do say of
 others more literally gifted but who that for an uncivilized race to be put see only the surface part of
 indian life through similar experiences it was according to nature that he should feel you who are of the anglo
 saxon resentment what people unless totally race who have never called any nation devoid of spirit would not feel a
 certain master and who since the days of amount of regret and chagrin in such william of normandy have never
 had a situation what people unless previ other manners and customs supersede ously slavish for a thousand years yours you
 do not know the feeling of would not feel like blaming the white our race we too loved our ways
 humpeople who were indirectly responsible ble though they were we too liked to for it all the agreement had been
 made run the affairs of our own land though in due form and order and there was we ran them
 but poorly we too loved much justice on the part of the govern our freedom can you conscientiously ment but
 for all that the consequent blame the feelings which those unedufeelings of the indians were inevitable cated indians fresh from
 the prairie entertained in those early days i know to me the massacre at frog lake now that it was
 to our ultimate welfare came in the natural course of events that you took over our land and that the
 eight mounds at frog lake are an by rights we should have gone down evidence of the last attempt of
 the indian on our knees and thanked you for doing to register his disapproval of the ever so likewise it
 was to the welfare of increasing power of another race in the england that the normans came but did land
 such events were necessary in the saxons drop on their knees to thank order that into the indian mind might
 them they certainly did not and i yenbe instilled that respect which is due to ture to say that you
 would not be the the sovereign of england and the higher people you are now had they done so order
 of life he represents let me make rightly conscious of your knowledge myself plain i am anxious that the in
 and civilization sometimes you are not dian be given justice in connection with able to see why other people do
 not that fell deed which so startled canada readily accede to dropping their former and which today looks like an
 old time life in order to take yours that love of curse upon one of our reserves i write freedom
 which has flowered forth so because i feel it is up to me to speak for spendidly in your national
 life is to be my race when they are obliged through lack of education to sit like a dumb nation
 while opinions concerning them are trading at fort pitt in 1884 some of these being formed throughout the country crees
 were later involved in the frog lake those opinions are very often the prod massacre left to right are four

 years ask yourself this question was the in ago he was a bush indian as were dian not so much
 as he is now but as he many of his band they were a quiet was then in a position
 to recognize and friendly and peaceable people at this to appreciate your what may be called time however there were
 five bands most complex and highly systematized altogether each under its own chief freedom the best and highest exhibi encamped
 at frog lake the prairie tion of freedom seen through ignorant crees from the south under their noted eyes may
 look like something else the chief big bear were there they were normans introduced good into england fresh from the
 prairie long used to better than there was in the country bloodshed and brought up from their before but the
 saxons failed to appre childhood to look upon warfare as the ciate them they wanted their own ways highest occupation
 this was natural and it was natural that they should since they were in constant touch with nations like individuals
 do not always the blackfeet and the bloods their feud take readily to those things that are best with these
 people which entailed shootfor them and the indians of 1885 were ing to kill at sight had eliminated all no
 exception to this rule the uncon ideas of chivalry from warfare when scious feeling of discontent was in their they
 went out to kill they killed without hearts it is because of inability on my much ceremony and in the
 most conpart if i have failed to show the funda venient and practical way that premental reason for the participation
 of sented itself to them at the moment some of the crees in the rebellion of 1885 the rest of
 the indians those who had always lived in close proximity to the the massacre at frog lake was only a
 hudson s bay forts were in character part of the rebellion an incident in it something halfway between these and
 in those days frog lake was in a corn the peace loving bush indians such paratively flourishing condition i have
 were the indians who were in the enbeen told the indian agency and the hudson s bay co were there
 and a mill was in the course of construction some all of these men were directly affected by two miles
 west all these are now gone the frog lake massacre left is thomas quinn the indian agent who was killed
 capt francis the only relics being the old cellar holes dickens n w m p forced to abandon fort pitt
 more or less covered with vegetation james k simpson h b c factor at frog lake his nephew stanley simpson
 and angus mckay campment at frog lake in the winter of ‘ 84 and ‘ 85 now i will briefly
 enumerate the causes of the massacre i have already mentioned the half conscious feeling of discontent and resentment this was
 the foundation of all at this place chance had brought many indians together and they were finding it very difficult
 to secure enough food they were stirred up by rumors of a possible uprising of the half breeds who did
 all they could to enlist the indians sympathy what made possible the massacre here as an immediate cause was a
 dislike some of the indians had for some of the white men in the settlement one or two of the
 men especially had a grudge which however they had kept to themselves because a personal quarrel was a dangerous thing
 in indian life it always meant not a bleeding nose or a black eye as in white life but death
 to one or both unless the men who fought were overpowered by others and persuaded to desist for this reason
 the indians had kept quiet and white people concerned must have thought that all was right and that the indians
 were friendly big bear chief of the crees was unable to restrain his warriors during the frog lake massacre and
 later battles with the alberta field force big bear has been greatly blamed for all the happenings of 1885 in
 these parts after hearing the stories told and thinking over them carefully i have come to the conclusion that he
 was not responsible for the massacre it was true he was chief but when you come to consider that as
 such he was only the leading man with no actually stated powers you can imagine how easy it was for
 any reckless spirits to go against his wishes in a time of excitement at the first shot standing near the
 door of the hudson s bay co store he gave a loud yell to stop the deed but it was
 too late the indians were past obeying any voice the day before the massacre all was quiet there were preparations
 for a feast and a dance nobody knew that within a few hours there would be trouble still there seemed
 to be an unnatural lull as if in anticipation of something dogs howled every now and again as if they
 sensed something the spirit of unrest that was in the west had infected the indians they talked about the rebellion
 the feast and the reasons for the bad feeling entertained by some of these individual indians i need not mention
 at this late date it is enough to say that there was some slight reason for trouble at this particular
 point i do not say that anything would ever have happened because of these things had there not been the
 spirit of unrest that prevailed throughout the west but even seeming insults sustained become intensified at moments of great popular
 excitement such was the case that night preceding the morning of the massacre a message had come from fort pitt
 in a letter to the indian that the rebellion had broken out at duck lake and advised them to remain
 quietly together and they would receive rations of food aymisees son of big bear advised that the chiefs of onion
 lake keheewin and long lake should be sent for to attend a council meeting where the advisability of staying out
 of the trouble could be discussed quietly so far all was good the dance was held it was not a
 war they were overtaken all was over in a dance but with so many indians con short time the only
 white man to gregated together recklessness began escape death was taken prisoner two to show itself among the young men
 white women were also made captive some men have told me they felt the but given fair treatment general excitement
 and restlessness that prevailed towards midnight things be it was sad for the killed it was sadder gan to look
 alarming for the slayers everything seemed to conspire towards the bringing about of the first act of hostility was the
 taking the deed had the white men exercised more tact in their dealings with the of a horse belonging to
 one of the white indians as did the old hudson bay co men by an indian by this time the
 men before them the indians would young men were feeling reckless enough have been friendly and the deed might to
 do anything some rode to the mill never have taken place the cumulative further west and brought in all the
 white force of everything that came into touch men from there mounted as they were with the indians at this
 time seemed they hurried back to camp at full speed to have worked towards some such and this had the
 additional effect of thing exciting the people by now it was daylight all walked to and fro the more the
 deed was done never to be unresponsible indians gave advice to the done murder was committed and human white men
 but it was not taken from blood unlawfully shed on frog lake the agency six white people were walk soil

 the power not go wandering spirit whose wife was of christianity the reserve once full the sister of the indian

 a pall over this place may gradually be said wandering spirit shooting him removed and that a time will come
 when dead the shot had the effect one would the sin that took place in 1885 will have naturally expect
 it to have under the been purged and the people be free to circumstances the mob spirit took hold go

 up his cattle last fall to yard and stable them for the winter he was fourteen head short about two
 weeks ago after the cold snap a cow and a year old of the missing ones appeared at the sheds
 one morning looking for admission their tracks were followed back and five head more of the missing band were found
 in a sort of hollow or coulee in the woods where they had yarded like moose all winter the snow
 was tramped down and everything eatable eaten off for a space of about seven acres but the cattle were still
 in fair condition the cattle had doubtless gone there in the fall attracted probably by the special greeness of the
 herbage and finding themselves comfortable did not attempt to make way through the snow as it became gradually deeper until
 at last when the feed became exhausted and the snow softened with the thaw the cow knowing the way to
 the sheds made a break for them the remaining seven head are still unheard from but mr cust now has

 working as an assistant in a watch repair shop before long john with a few newly made acquaintances joined one
 of the parties making up for manitoba the route of the old dawson road was long and rough it was
 partly over a primitive wagon road but mostly by rivers and lakes and the five hundred mile journey lasted twenty
 eight days so it was that john and his companions reached winnipeg on july 12 1873 put up at the
 immigration hall and set about looking for employment having worked their way from thunder bay the young men s first
 venture was the unloading of a ilatboat that had come down the red river with a supply of merchandise from
 st paul a variety of small labouring jobs followed but mc dougall being a good salesman and a good penman
 was constantly on the lookout for something better soon he found a job in a government office doing clerical work
 which was more to his liking but held out little prospect for advancement he was offered jobs with the hudson
 bay company and in the post office but each demanded that he sign long term contracts and this he would
 not do he wanted to get into business for himself and be on his own john a mcdougall pioneer trader
 later became mayor and prominent edmonton businessman make a comfortable living as another man s subordinate on his return to
 winnipeg from kildonan college he took a position in a fur store for a few months with a mr henderson

 who also was dissatisfied with work on salary john suggested a grocery store kept by themselves and his friend volunteered
 to invest 400 mcdougall was to do all the work of establishing it having saved a little money and being
 of good character he was able to obtain sufficient credit to start the business he secured a small building twenty
 feet by finding himself with prospects of no work all winter with native economy and foresight john went down to
 kuc onan college now manitoba university vihere he could board more cheaply than he could in the town and at
 the same time continue his education at this period he was not yet twenty years of age although far from
 home and eager to test his own resources the teachers at the newly established college were helpful friends of the
 ambitious lad and offered him much encouragement there are many kinds of ambition john a mcdougall s was first to
 make a fortune and a place for himself at the top of the commercial world to this end he was
 never content while on salary and spent years of unremunerative struggle as a small trader rather than thirty feet at
 a rental of 400 per year for 250 a carpenter put in shelves counters and display windows supplying the material
 at a high price for lumber then was brought down the red river from minnesota in flatboats even the preliminaries
 made the capital look sadly shrunken to secure a stock of groceries the young merchant ap proached a man known
 at flatboat to winnipeg and the fort and one and sutherland with a frank statement of all were enthusiastic over
 the merits of the firm s financial position and a gen their great country manitoba people in erous supply was

 traders altogether the the river froze and the flatboats were stranger was convincing the trade was tied up for the
 winter the young men effected and both parties went their could not hope to do this so john s part
 way ner sizing up the situation pulled out next day john mcdougall had reason of the business john made it
 known that to regret his bargain and he seriously he wished to sell his stand and when a doubted the

 winter john a drifted at fort carlton the traders sold their about keeping eyes and ears open and goods in
 short order to the indians for the most impressive things he heard buffalo robes and leather and went back were
 about the great unsettled country with cheerful minds to winnipeg they to the west all summer the traders and arrived
 there late in september but hunters were coming in from the plains flushed with their first successes and with the
 pleasant prairie life they de of sociable intelligent people and the cided on a second trip and buying more young
 trader also went out from time to cai t and ponies outfitted again time on trading expeditions to the indians
 whose camps lay forty or fifty in october mcdougall set out again for the prairie with a caravan of carts
 miles away on the prairie thai winter accompanied by two other traders he found plenty of time for reading and
 read all of shakespeare plays most of named clarke and sinclair had that year seen an indian summer lasting his
 reading was done by firelight for he did not allow himself even the luxury through the month of november all
 of a candle those were the days in would have gone well with the traders but instead winter set in
 on october which people learned gracefully to do 20 th at cut arm creek somewhat west without for coal oil
 was three dollars a of fort ellice they were met by a blind gallon salt fifty cents a pound and
 ing snowstorm the hard thick snow sugar raisins and candles equally exblocked the cart wheels so the course pensive was
 directed to the touchwood hills in the spring he returned to winniwhere timber could be had to make peg and
 the following summer took up sleighs and after a hard struggle the more carts of goods to victoria now party
 reached its goal once there they pakan on the saskatchewan river made a big camp turned their horses north east
 of fort edmonton this was out to scrape for feed and themselves his first venture into the country where made
 sleighs with the roots of trees for he was to become a leading citizen by runners they stopped eight or
 ten days this time his stock of goods was of conin the hills making these then unloaded siderable volume and
 he was able to the carts cached them in the woods and continue his trading throughout the winset out for
 the trading post luck was ter his life that winter was a new and with the traders and they reached
 prince strange experience and can best be albert post on christmas eve described in his own words taken ver they
 wintered at the post john mc batim from one of his letters written at dougall renting a small log house
 where the time he opened up his trading outfit to john that winter always remained trains of red river carts
 provided the main a very pleasant memory there was a means of transportation in the early days this fairly large
 settlement at prince albert group was photographed in 1879 it is a funny life that i lead so victoria it
 was this spring 1877 that will tell you a little how it is john a dcdougall first came to edmonpassed
 in the first part of the win ton driving through this post while on ter i had a man a
 native engaged his way to calgary with the rev and to do my trading for me but he did mrs
 sinclair of victoria who were not suit me so i discharged him and bound for morley there was nothing but
 ever since i do my own trading a trail between the saskatchewan river with the indians going out once or
 post and the bow river two hundred twice every week to sell goods and miles to the south and the
 party ran out bring back furs i sometimes use of food two days before the journey was dogs and sometimes
 a horse the completed at calgary the rev john way they drive the dogs here is to mcdougall was building
 a small church hitch them up one ahead of the and the vistors from victoria who were other using four
 to a flat sleigh his guests helped him shingle the roof ten or twelve feet long and about before they
 went on to morley one foot wide one half inch thick on this sleigh i strap my load and that
 trip through the edmonton counaway i go running nearly all the try to morley ended john mcdougall s way off
 in all directions through first connection with the west his woods over hills down and up year s trading had
 been very successful deep ravines across creeks and but by the time he returned to winnipeg lakes until i reach
 the indian with his furs the bottom was out of the camps they live in leather tents fur market and
 he closed the year with the fire in the middle the first heavily in debt he was not dismayed thing
 they do when i get there is he still had plans and an unshaken faith put the kettle on and
 make tea in the future of the west when we all have something to eat in the late summer he
 returned to his me supplying everything of course home in ontario and that winter he did after that they fill
 their pipes and himself well by peddling goods in nearhave a smoke sitting round the by towns and villages on
 a commission fire tailor fashion while i open my basis but by this time he was a westgoods give the
 men each a plug of erner knew the west and had faith in tobacco and commence to trade i his
 own ability to recover his loss and can speak creè 0:cree pretty well now make good with the help of the
 right and so get on with them splendidly sometimes i don t reach the indians partner so on the 20
 th day of march 1878 he married and accompanied by the first night and so have to camp his wife
 returned to winnipeg to make out in the woods all alone getting a fresh start they crossed the lakes to
 into the most sheltered spot i cut duluth by boat from duluth to fisher s a lot of dry wood
 and make a fire landing by railway and then by then scrape the snow away get steamer down the red
 river to winnipeg some willows to spread on the which they reached may 20 1878 ground to make my bed
 on when my bed is made i melt snow and it was a hard and difficult year for make some
 tea then have my sup mcdougall and his young wife but he per it s very plain without any made
 some progress and managed to luxuries after this i sit by the fire pay off a little of his previous
 year s and think think of you and home debts he fully realized the value and the past and the
 future this is very need of keeping his credit good lonesome sometimes i am out this way when it s
 snowing and blow during the summer he witnessed one ing and so cold have generally to of the colourful events
 of those early get up several times during the romantic yoars it was a gathering of night and put more
 wood on the five thousand indians on the plains near fire everything is very still except sounding lake where he
 had gone to for the occasional howl of a wolf or trade chief big bear was on the wara lynx
 or some night bird path counselling his indians not to take treaty war attire was predominant in the spring he
 returned to winnipeg john and his wife were eye witnesses to and took up more carts of goods to the
 great council of war fortunately this frame store was built by john a mcdougall in 1882 it was located on
 the north west corner of jasper ave and 98 th street in edmonton and went under the name of john
 a mcdougall and co it later became hudson s bay company s first store on jasper ave the indians did
 not accept their chief s excellent english and is in every counsel and they took treaty mcdougall way a perfect
 gentleman he has sold all his goods and returned to win long black curly hair he wears a nipeg for
 more deer skin coat beaded leggings and carries a revolver at his side during this summer he continued to he
 was telling us all about the operate from winnipeg in trading with sioux the prairie indians and even considered settling
 permanently in manitoba and john s first store was in a big log opening a general store at portage ia
 house on jasper avenue near 97 th street prairie the lower part being used as a residence and the floor
 above for a store by the spring of 1879 he had changed there is an interesting comment in ct his
 mind and decided to head for ed letter written by mrs mcdougall dated monton john left winnipeg with his august

 approximately where the thought he could make a success of cenotaph now stands the following it nevertheless he then asked
 me year this building was moved to jasper if i would undertake to buy his first avenue onto the lot
 now occupied by stock of goods for him and on credit the canadian bank of commerce he as he did
 not expect his money behad purchased this corner lot from the fore the fall i said i would do this
 hudson s bay company in 1881 for the and thought i could arrange matters sum of 50 and at the
 same time the two as i was well known in the trade adjoining lots to the west for 25 apiece
 and my credit was good ten years later the price of jasper avenue lots had gone up as we see
 from i went east and bought a stock a diary entry of mr richard secord of goods for my own

 the best of friends and he continued to deal with the same an interesting story of the early days firms
 to which l introduced him relates to the founding of a competing business as told by john a mcdougall after
 mr secord was admitted to partin one of his letters nership in 1897 the business became known as mcdougall secord

 no trumpet in the marketplace gold in the west it has long been a fixed principle with men of enquiring
 minds that the precious metals are to be had for the seeking as well on the east as on the
 west of the rocky mountains and the circumstances we are about to relate may or may not strengthen the conviction
 an english gentleman named sheffield proceeded last year on a hunting expedition to the saskatchewan he returned to the settlement
 in the autumn with an indian whom he took with him either to canada or england before leaving however the
 indian told john ferguson a guide to the western country and who was therefore known to him that whilst hunting
 on the mandell river south of the saskatchewan in company with himself and his the indian s brother mr sheffield
 found a large lump of metal which he supposed to be gold and which he meant to test on his
 return to england he further said that mr sheffield had made handsome presents to the other indian who had been
 left on the saskatchewan to keep quiet on the subject and that to secure his the storytelling indian s confidence
 mr sheffield was taking him away on his part mr sheffield said nothing about the alleged discovery of gold having
 hastened his return but stated that he had been obliged to give up the expedition for that year owing to
 his gun getting out of repair people laughed at the idea of his going home to england to fix his
 gun and coming out again to finish the hunt but such was he declared his intention and such evidently is
 his intention for he wrote by the last mail to a guide at red river instructing him to meet him
 with horses next month at crow wing but whether he intends to finish the buffalo hunt or the gold hunt
 we are unable to say the report of his having found gold obtained currency last fall but it was promptly
 contradicted and a counter statement was set afloat that this year mr sheffield intended to bring out a party to
 colonise on the saskatchewan be that as it may the colonization party must not expect to have all the diggings
 to themselves their movements will doubtless be closely watched we would however caution the people of red river against the
 folly of pursuing a phantom and remind them that even gold may be bought too dear it may not be
 amiss to mention that when the california gold mania was raging john f harrictt esq a chief trader of the
 hudson s bay company whilst residing in the intericr happened one day to show the indians a specimen of the
 gold which had been found at the new el dorado the indians shrugged their shoulders and said if that was
 the stuff the white man made so much fuss about they knew where there was plenty to be found of
 the same kind and indicated smoky river 170 miles north of edmonton as the golden country as a set off
 however to any case which visionaries may be inchired to establish on such slight evidence as this and also to
 afford another illustration of the well known motto all is not gold that glitters we may recall a fact within
 the recollection of most of our readers in red river two or three years ago mr mcdermot found at sturgeon
 creek a substance unknown which he brought from the ground from its close resemblance to that much coveted metal everybody
 here who saw it declared it to be gold but scientific men abroad cruelly crushed their fond expectations chemists ref

 may 14 1860 modern history museums by clifford p wilson most persons regard museums as somewhat musty dusty institutions that
 are seldom visited by anyone but tourists and by people with very special interests the suggestion that if properly run
 museums can become a powerful social force one of the chief tools in adult education may seem to you quite
 absurd nevertheless it is true this fact is recognized much more lection for instance stuck about with widely in the
 united states than it is illegible and yellowed labels or simply in canada and much more in eastern marked with

 sign because up for which similar claims are made must to now alberta has shown less interest have been at
 least ninety seven feet in museums than any of the other eight long provinces on the mainland of canada such
 objects in the would be donors it is true that under mr manning s eyes are too good to throw
 away but five year plan a provincial museum has at the same time they will not be tolerbeen placed at
 the bottom of the list ated at home in any place but the attic but it is there the city
 of edmonton has so a history museum is the obvious place also begun a movement to set up an for
 them or is it a lot of people think historical museum quite soon and i hope so and they are
 mortally offended when that the distant promise of a provincial a museum director who knows his busimuseum will not squelch
 this excellent nes politely but firmly declines to accept plan after all there are three main them for modern history
 museums are types of museums and most canadian not high class junk shops they are cities of any size have
 examples of all bright airy places where history is told three art natural history and human sequentially as a tale
 is told and where history the present is as much a part of that if the provincial government wants tale
 as the past is the objects you see to set up a museum illustrating the na there are things that
 our forebearslural history of alberta as the govern and even ourselves sometimes made ment has so admirably done for our
 and used in an era that is now forever sister province cf saskatchewan what gone not only that these objects
 are is to discourage the city of edmonton selected from the museum s collection from setting up a museum illustrating
 and arranged in such a way as to tell the human history of edmonton and an understandable story vicinity perhaps
 when some persons visualize the original purpose of history musuch a project as a history museum they seums was to
 preserve and exhibit any picture a collection of curios culled from object of an historical nature and let it a
 hundred attics and presented to the go at that they were looked upon as an museum in what the donors
 regard as a enlarged version of the private curio series of magnanimous gestures cabinet in which the objects were ar

 national museum of canada ottawa and was formerly director of western canadiana for the glenbow foundation in calgary he is
 one of canada s leading authorities on history museums and was longtime editor of the beaver mr wilson addressed the
 calgary branch on march 4 th 1960 on the subject modern trends in history museums but because it was made
 from notes only he kindly provided the review with a ta ic on the same general subject given to the
 knights of the round table calgary on sept 16 1958 of historical sequence article in unesco s handsome maga as
 time went on objects of a non zine museum published in paris and historical nature found their way into that
 choice was largely due to its eye the collection and were tolerated there appeal because they were donated by one
 of the there seems to be an impression premuseum s trustees or because they were valent among enthusiasts who want
 to part of a private collection presented start a museum that provided you ve on the condition that it be
 kept intact got a building and a collection of obas a memorial to the donor jects you can start however
 the most gradually the word museum came important part of a museum is neither to mean a storehouse of relics
 and curios one of these the director is the first and full of dust and mustiness a place to be
 foremost consideration he is the proavoided except when one was showing fessional man with years of experience a visiting relative
 the sights of the city and training who decides how the mu the objects were crowded together in seum will
 be laid out and what sort of poorly lighted cases and explained by material should be collected for it he
 labels that were dusty and illegible is the man who deals diplomatically there was little order either in the cases
 with the fossil and arrowhead addicts themselves or in the museum as a and if he is wise he will
 not be influwhole and the so called display became enced by the social standing of the peoan example of what
 has been well pie who come bearing gifts described as visible storage such a firm selective policy may make i
 use the past tense here because the going tough for a new director and these conditions are no longer true
 of will undoubtedly alienate a few people all history museums but of course they who consider themselves eminently are still
 true of many museums in the qualified to say what should go into a united states as well as canada
 while museum of history running a museum museums of art and science have forged is a profession not a hobby
 one has ahead using all the latest methods of to learn the art of telling a story by display and
 lighting and labelling and means of objects just as one has to carrying out their functions with on learn the
 art of telling a story by means ginality and imagination the history of printed words museums have lagged behind i
 have a number of friends and in a modern history museum the ob acquaintances among the leading hisjects are well
 lighted clearly and briefly torians in canada but not one of them labelled and attractively displayed would ever consider himself
 capable of with professional attention given to setting up a first class history museum colour and design more and more
 the any more than i should consider myself competent display man is being called capable of giving a course in
 history it upon to play a major part in museum is one thing to know the subject but a activities
 when i completely reorgan very different thing to know how to conized the hudson s bay co museum in vey
 that knowledge to others but beside winnipeg a few years ago i asked the the museum man s task the
 teacher s store s display manager to design each is comparatively simple the latter job exhibit and choose the background
 color is to instruct a class of people who have for it and the result was positively already shown a
 desire to learn what startling he is teaching by attending his lecture for instance the director of one of the
 museum man on the other hand the country s largest art galleries was in must first lure his students as
 we town one day and i asked him to come might call them into his building and over and see
 the new set up he agreed must keep them there by presenting his without enthusiasm he had seen knowledge in
 an attractive way moreplenty of small history museums and to over the museum visitor has made no a man of
 taste they were anathema but investment in his ‘ course of instruction as soon as he got inside his eyes
 as the classroom student has and feels popped and at once he became highly no compulsion to remain a minute
 longer enthusiastic and vitally interested that than he wants to museum is the only one in canada that much more
 can be done by a museum has been given a full scale illustrated director with a small purse and a
 large imagination than by one with plenty of atize our theme and make the visitor funds but little initiative personnel
 is feel that he is one of the actors more important than possessions or to that is quite a job
 a very particular put it another way it isn t what a mu sort of job especially when trying to
 seum has that matters it is what is does recreate this pulsing life out of inaniwith what it has a
 modern museum is mate objects it is no job for amateurs an active institution rather than a pas but it
 is one in which the oood display sive one it is not merely a showroom man can employ all his
 art it sets out deliberately to educate adults perhaps you think that a glass case as well as children whether
 they come with twenty interesting objects in it is to the museum or not preferable to one with only ten
 inter by means of travelling displays esting objects then let me tell you of a branch museums and loans to
 schools test made by a museum in buffalo today s museum reaches a far greater a display case was well
 filled with audience than it could be simply keep material and a man with a stop watch ing all its
 possessions in one place like stationed unobstrusively near by to recthe department store with a mail order ord the average
 time spent by each visibusiness it caters both to the people tor over that case next half the objects who
 can come to see the displays in per were removed and the rest rearranged son and to those who cannot
 the stop watch man again went into his number one consideration then is act and when the two averages were
 the director or curator he can make or compared it was found that each person break the institution of which
 he is the spent about twice as much time over half head yet how often his appointment is the number
 of objects in other words not even considered until things are well each object got four times as much atalong
 until the funds and the material tention as it did in the first instance are collected and the building is
 almost the museum can become a powerful finished only after that is some con tool in adult education if it
 is properly sideration given to staff used and if it is to get the serious sup now the second most
 important per port of the public it must show that it son on the staff of a history museum is
 can teach children as well as adults an the display man or woman his impor appeal for the better education
 of our tance is in attracting the public yet how children never falls on deaf earsmany museums in canada even
 consider especially at this time and in this provemploying one the usual attitude is ince where there is so much
 concern that almost anyone on the staff can be about the subject entrusted with the art of display which one
 competent museum man has said is comparable to saying that anyone that he would never organize a museum working in
 a store can put in a good primarily for visitors in the larval or window school going stage of existence
 it is a museum windows are in fact compar false assumption that what can be able to the show windows
 in a store absorbed with benefit by mature people and because people have become accus can and should be presented
 and extomed to arresting displays in store win pounded to the young but somehow it dows most displays in what
 might be is hard to whip up the enthusiasm for called museum windows are by con the education of parents
 that one can for trast dull and uninspiring a museum the instruction of their children casefront should be a magic
 casement in brief if we want public support opening onto a strange and fascinating for the history museum it is
 through the life arthur parker of rochester who field of education that we must appeal wrote the standard work on
 history to the public and parents who take an museums observed that there must be interest in the museum because
 it helps something in the museum that seems to to educate their children may quite unpulse with life that thrills
 the beholder consciously absorb a good deal of inthat enables him to see that he is a part formation themselves
 so much in fact of history museums must not be dead that they may become really interested things nor have
 the atmosphere of a in the history of their community and of funeral parlor we must so plan our their
