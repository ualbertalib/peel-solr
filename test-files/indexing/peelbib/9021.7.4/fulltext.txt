 s controversy of 1892 one of edmonton s most colorful and controversial events was the attempted removal of the lain
 i office in 1892 this occurred a year a ter the railway arrived on the south side of the river
 when the new town of strathcona w s being developed when the government attempted to move the land office from
 edmonton to the south side the old settlers were prepared to defend it by any action necessary it was felt
 and perhaps rightly that the loss of any government offices would result in the new town over shadowing edmonton accusations
 were hurled freely at the lain i agent the iwinister of the interior the government in general and the promoters
 of the new townsite in the end the determined stand taken by the people of edmonton resulted in the land
 of ice remaining on the nor h side of tile rivet and a branch being established in strathcona 7 lie

 condition of things at edmonton minister of justice answered that land office would not be removed from edmonton and that
 the only thing contemplated was to place an office on south side for convenience of coming immigrants wilfrid laurier the
 vitriolic pen of edmonton bulletin s editor frank oliver was well known to pioneer in view of these assurances there
 western canadians his newspaper s coverage of the land office steal was a mixture of good being no desire to
 interfere with the land reporting and outspoken editorializing business of the district or the establishment of a branch office in
 south edmon open as usual on thursday morning ton when inspector piercv informed with forest ranger a e johnstone in
 mayor mccauley at noon that he had charge and that all business could be been instructed to proceed with the
 removal of such portion of the books as transacted there as usual considered as were necessary to the transaction of
 a promise and in connection with the busi iess there no objection was made assurances received from ottawa this at
 about one o clock inspector piercy was good enough and the books the drove to the land office accompanied by
 agent and assistant agent quietly rolled four policemen agent anderson assistant agent royal and forest ranger john away and the
 citizens dispersed stone removed a portion of the books on thursday morning at ten o clock in the presence of
 the mayor and about two settlers desirous of making entry 50 citizens what books were taken and what left of
 course none but the officials went to the edmonton land office accould know johnstone who was left in companied by
 mayor mccauley and charge of the edmonton office was asked found agent anderson in charge reif the books necessary to

 information mentioned one that had and it was and transact business generally assispromptly returned before the books were taken away
 agent anderson announced tant agent jules royal was at the subthat the edmonton land office would be office on the
 south side editorial june 23 1892 is difficult to see unless the saskatche no doubt the rights and wrongs of
 the wan is the most extraordinary river in events which have taken place at ed the world and has only
 one bank if the monton since saturday last will be very majority of the people requiring to do widely discussed
 and no doubt those business at the land office in getting who corruptly attempted to use their wood and hay
 permits or making homeofficial position to advance their own stead entries resided or were homeprivate interests to the inconvenience steading
 on the south side the arguand loss of the general public will find ment might be good but when as
 a plenty of lick spittle apologists who will matter of fact a large majority of those stop at no limit
 of defamation of this requiring wood and hay permits reside country or its people to draw attention on the north
 side where also the mafrom the acts of these corrupt officials jority of homesteads are being taken the hogs who
 look upon the government argument is absolutely and entirely only as a swill factory and who will false if the
 only business farmers had squeal for or against anything on the in life was to deal with the land office
 chance of thereby securing a greater it might be a convenience to have the share of swill office on the
 side of the river on which if the decision to remove the office was they lived but when they are
 compelled to come to town from time to time to sell arrived at after full information and consideration on the
 grounds of public their produce or purchase supplies it is very much more convenient for them to interest why the
 secret flitting did not have the land office near the principal the public interest and convenience and centre of business
 no matter which side the welfare of the public service require of the river it may be on than to
 have that due notice of the removal should be it on any particular side given so that people who had
 business to transact on the north side could close if it was only intended to establish a it up before
 the office was removed and temporary branch office for the benefit did it not require that proper accommo of incoming
 settlers would it not have datjon for the office should be provided been much more in order to have estabbefore
 removal is it in the public inter lished one at peace hills forty miles est to hawk books containing practically
 south where there is a large influx of the titles to hundreds of thousands of new settlers rather than only
 two miles dollars worth of land from an estab away from the existing office it is amply lished office to

 smallest consider on the face of the affair it is plain ation affecting the proposed removal that there was no
 well considered inten there is only one reasonable reason and tion on the part of the government and that is
 that it was attempted in order to as plain that it was what the people sup boom osler hammond nanton

 the inspector of agencies and the there by creating the impression that the minister of interior at the instigation of
 government was about to repeat the osler hammond nanton who trusted regina experiment and pour out hunif they got away
 with the office quietly dreds of thousands in public buildings to be able to give sufficient reasons for to boom
 the property of a few men keeping the town office closed that the removal was intended to be entire and
 they would like incoming settlers to permanent the advertisement of the believe that the south bank of the sasagent plainly
 shows either he had full katchewan river is the boundary beyond authority to insert this notice or he had which
 it would be useless to go to benot if he had the minister of interior little the extent advantages and

 be sustained stone gods of the prairies james g macgregor for some years now i have been interested in the
 pre historic graven stones and the various figures laid out in stones on many of the highest hills in alberta
 s prairies the earliest settlers and ranchers referred to these as ribstones stone gods or simply as piles of stones
 the archaeologists refer to the first two of these as petroglyphs meaning graven stones and to the latter as mosaics
 meaning stones laid out in a pattern on being pressed to exceed the strict limits of scientific statement they will
 venture a guess that to some indian people these must have had a sacred significance and that they may be
 of considerable antiquity meaning maybe as much as 3 000 years old but they stress the fact that these are
 only non scientific guesses which are not capable of proof i approach these relics of a bygone cult of the
 buffalo although i am not a civilization on our prairies in a more believer in the so called annual southsentimental
 mood to me most of them erly migration of the buffalo generally represent sacred objects of pre historic these monuments
 lie in the prairie por indians who in much the same way as tion of alberta and extend north into
 we do strove to penetrate the eternal that part of the parkland areas which mysteries of life and in their
 groping to prior to two hundred years ago were wards god centred some part of their prairies they do not
 seem to occur in reverence around these visual symbols saskatchewan but this may be because such an approach may be
 unscientific of a lack of knowledge on my part which and may border on the romantic but dissemination of this
 article may help to does not all our fascination with history correct they do extend into northern border on the
 romantic montana where at least three rib my purposes in writing this for the stones are known this concentration of
 review are threefold to make some record these monuments into the alberta or of these phenomena to interest others western
 edge of the prairies may be bewho may know of other stone gods cause the plains indians wintered in the
 and who will add to this record and sheltered foothills areas and thus most finally to suggest that these sacred
 sym of their forays after buffalo were conbols scattered far and wide on our centrated along the western edge of
 the prairies should be preserved preserving prairies these presents some difficulties if the these monuments are invariably on government obtained
 title to these and the top of the highest hill for miles tried to preserve them the very fact of
 around although they do not occur on making their location known to the pub every outstanding hill of the prairies
 lic would inevitably invite the attention obviously they would not be likely to be of vandals and in a short
 time these found on a hill that was naturally devoid hilltops which once rang with the sacred of stones although
 it seems possible that fervour of our predecessors on these the ribstones for instance may have plains would be fouled
 with broken been carried a short distance so as to glass and other impedimenta of youthful place them on the
 very top of a hill it is exuberance for this reason the exact usually possible to see at least one
 of location of these monuments is not given these sacred hills from some other one here a list giving their
 location how if ceremonies took place on these hills at ever will be attached to copies of the certain specific
 seasons the ascending review filed with the rutherford library smoke from the lodge fires of the celeand the provincial library
 brants could have been seen from one to me there seems to be some connec hilltop to another through the
 vast extion between these symbols and some panse of crystal clear prairie mr macgregor is president of the society and
 a well known alberta author whenever they have not been dis taken title and erected a cairn on this turbed
 by ploughing or haying stone site originally there was a third and mementos of pre historic people are corn much
 smaller carved stone but some mon on the prairies tepee rings are corn vandals have carried it off mon here
 and there amongst the rolling in the case of photograph b there were hills of the prairies lie other piles
 of two stones one much smaller than the rocks generally about two feet wide and other and a farmer in
 the area has this high by about three feet long these are one in safe keeping in his yard the
 thought to be markers placed there by early settlers in this area dug around the indians to show where in
 some long these stones and found a stone pipe forgotten battle friends were overcome many beads and other trinkets and
 asor enemies were overwhelmed a sim sert that as late as 1900 passing indians ilar marker is described in the
 article in left offerings beside these two gods the autumn 1957 review entitled a this to my mind indicates the
 reverence historical marker by t and a kehoe in which these stones were held by the from time to time
 someone discovers plains indians of historic times it is not such a pile of stones and destroys it in a
 proof however that these stones were macabre but fruitless attempt to exhume carved originally by these modern tribes a long
 dead indian i believe that as one tribe succeeded tepee rings and medicine wheels another on our prairies each one
 yenmarking the tepee in which some chief crated these images i venerate them died and other piles of rocks are
 of no too in spite of my university degrees special significance now and yet on the these stone gods of
 the hilltops fill me battlefields of eastern america our civil with an inexplicable reverence ization has erected markers to show
 stone c appears to have led a soliwhere various participants fell tary existence but i understand that but the sacred
 stone monuments which white men have rolled it down from its interest me fall into two groups the original vantage
 point further up the first are the ribstones stone gods hill it too is treasured by the present or petroglyphs
 it is easy to see why the owner of the ranch early ranchers called some of these rib stone d
 once reposed on a hilltop a stones photographs a b and c showing short distance north and east of sunnythree
 of these illustrate the ribbed effect nook john martin of rosebud gave the made by a series of parallel incisions
 writer a photograph taken in 1912 trending down the sides of the stone from showing this face like figure placed
 at a central groove running along its back the head of a sinuous arrangement of a multitude of pock marks
 have been field stones as if it were the head of a ground into the surface of the stone with
 snake there is some suggestion howout any discernible order all of the ever that some cowboys arranged the stones shown
 in photographs a to f are field stones in this manner so that the of hard quartzite and vary in
 size from snake like figure may not have been the three to four feet long and all of the work
 of the indians in any event the markings are man made the ribs un stone was hauled from the site
 in 19 12 doubtedly have been graven by first and after many peregrinations ended rubbing the main stone with other
 up in the national museum at ottawa smaller stones and then given a finishing stone e another petroglyph has also
 touch to the incision by using sand as been torn from its original site and is an abrasive in the
 case of the pock now in the grounds of the new dinosaur marks these must have been made by museum
 near steveville rotating a smaller stone in the cavity much as we would use a drill and pos six ribstones
 found in alberta are shown in sibly by using sand as an abrasive to the accompanying illustration figure a is

 on erected a monument to the stones figures b and c have the strange ribbed and pocked markings the part

 which the al museum steveville while figure f has also been berta government has very laudably removed from its original
 site petroglyph f has been moved to a farm yard some three miles from its original site in addition to
 these there is said to be another petroglyph in the neutral hills and three in montana two of which are
 outside a museum in great falls while i believe another is in malta montana there must be others and certainly
 there should be some in saskatchewan i hope that the publication of this article may bring these to our attention
 perhaps less awesome but no less fascinating are the two stone mosaics which the writer has seen on other prairie
 hilltops and which he regards as sacred ceremonial sites many of the prairie hilltops have figures laid out in stone
 some clearly depicting a manothers of less certain figures and some merely geometrical forms but the two described here are
 of unusual interest the first is on a hill near the red deer river from which the three hills far
 to the west are visible and standing out to the east are other hills on which are found ribstones while
 in the distance rise the misty blue outlines of the hand hills and the wintering hills and in between stretches
 the vast prairie the prairie once filled with the black dots and masses that were grazing buffalo herds on a
 natural mound on the very top of this hill is an annular pile of stones about twenty feet in diameter
 and three or four feet high then surrounding this pile and about thirty feet from the centre of it there
 is a ring of carefully laid field stcnes hard by stretched out on his back lies a man some thirty
 feet tall and there is no question about his sex separated from him and well above his outstretched left hand
 is another mosaic which has a vague resemblance to a bear a wolf or maybe a horse and than between
 it and the hand is some other figure these are shown in figure g in which the stones forming the
 man and the other two figures are drawn very carefully to scale it is not always possible however to distinguish
 the original stones that have long been imbedded in the turf from those scattered about by thoughtless persons to the
 extent that this is so the sketch has pcssible errors while this figure of a man app ars to me
 to be stretched out lying figure c is a scale drawing of a stone mosiac on a hill near the
 red deer river the central pile of stones is about twenty feet in diameter and three to four feet high
 at the lower right is the figure of a man with the head having been destroyed when vandals dug a
 pit at that site ab 3 ve it is another unidentified figure which has likely been dislurbed from its original
 position on his back vandals have dug a pit where his head was and his right arm is missing and
 the stones that undoubtedly once formed it have been scattered helter skelter over the site there is the possibility that
 this mosaic may portray the profile of a man crouching slightly as one might when shooting off an arrow so
 much for what must have been the central ceremonial group the remainder of the hilltop possibly five acres in extent
 has several groupings of stones one is a splendid tepee ring while another is slightly disarranged but evidently was the
 ring of a tepee some twenty seven feet in diameter one grouping of stones in which all of those remaining
 undisturbed are about a foot in diameter suggests by its sinuous curves the fcrm of a snake having an over
 all length around the curves of fifty feet the writer suspects that petroglyph f mentioned previously was hauled from this
 hill but has not yet been able to confirm this if it was it is possible that it formed the
 head of this snake there are other groupings of stones which do nct appear to have been disturbed but plotting
 them on paper does not reveal any likeness to which a name i scale ft 2 l could be assigned
 here and there also must be others possibly in the hand on this large site are small heaps of hills
 or the wintering hills or else along stones which are believed to be battle the bow near gleichen or in
 the rainy markers hills or possibly the great sand hills the second ceremonial site is on a along the south
 saskatchewan and in hill high above the little bow river the other places as for mosaic figures of central annulus
 is essentially the same men there are examples of these in the as that described previously but in this neutral
 hills and the hills above dead case there are two outer concentric rings lodge canyon one with a radius of
 thirty feet and the it is hoped that this preliminary listing other with a radius of forty five feet of
 mosaics and petroglyphs may form possibly because of the remoteness of a starting point in arousing interest in this site
 these have only been slightly these monuments and that as a result disturbed by vandals and have an open many
 others will be brought to our cittening through both rings which is lined tion these relics of our predecessors in
 with stones much the same as a garden these plains should be treasured they path scattered on this and on
 adjoining were placed there by the reverend hands hills over perhaps a quarter section of of a people who loved
 the rolling hills pasture land are other piles of marker and vast distances of our magnificent stones some of them
 quite large prairies and who in their own way these two are the only ceremonial sought their god no less
 earnestly and sites of which i know at present there perhaps no less successfully than we do watch calgary grow
 a day or two ago the body of an indian was found on nose hill east of the city enclosed
 in a box word was brought into town and the indian being said to be a blackfoot major mcgibbon wired
 to mr m begg informing him of the fact yesterday morning mr begg accompanied by drs porter coroner and mcdonald

 to be necessary might be at once taken an indian prisoner was also taken to the spot to assist in

 yesterday afternoon calgary herald mar 13 1897 the sacrifical stone fact or fiction mr macgregor s article on the various
 stone gods or petroglyphs in alberta caused the editor of the review to dig through his files for a mystifying
 study of this same subject it was a paper written by jean l heureux in 1884 and read before the
 british association for the advancement of science at a meeting in montreal this paper as well as the correspondence accompanying
 it is now retained in the indian affairs archives in ottawa it was written while l heureux was government interpreter
 at the blackfoot indian reserve near gleichen it is a strange story and parts of it have been written off
 as pure fiction by ethnologists on the other hand some parts have a ring of truth although even these may
 be gross exaggerations l heureux was an unusual man known to some as a liar and a thief and to
 ot hers as a faithful employee of the government for more than ten years he came west from quebec in
 the 1850 s and lived with the blackfoot indians during the days that they wandered over the prairies it is
 likely during this time that he discovered the sacrificial stone when the indians settled on their reserve he became their
 official interpreter in 1882 he removed the sacrificial stone from its site and presented it to the marquis of lorne
 the governor general of canada four years later it was given to the national museum of canada and is now
 stored in ottawa in 1884 h s haliburton of the british association for the advancement of science asked the government
 if l heureux could prepare an article on the stone the interpreter complied with these orders and on aug 18
 1884 he sent the article to edgar dewdney indian commissioner commenting that i was obliged to copy them from my
 french copies comments in the form of footnotes have been added to l heureux s article for the clarification of
 several points these ccmments are by dr richard g forbis archaeologist for the glenbow foundation calgary and by the editor

 are seen all over the san juan valley in the cliff dwellers which abound in that region an ancient site
 of the western branch of the mound builders appears to have been the head waters of missouri river whence they
 spread themselves north as far as the south saskatchewan and its tributaries establishing numerous colcnies all along the eastern base
 of tho mountains and away south to the headwaters of rio grande by the south pass of the rcckies the
 scattered remains of mound builders works in the north west territory are connected by a similar chain of works at
 james river in north dakota with the great artery of the misscuri mounds and show more of a migratcry movement

 13 the sun dance no fear of riel the herald of battleford discusses the presence of riel at prince albert
 in an intelligent manner the herald is not a bigoted paper and it has no sensational column the herald says
 â€˜ that riel has come in on the invitation of his friends to be their leader is freely admitted but
 no open declaration has lately been made as to just what they want it is a suspicious circumstance however that
 immediately following his arrival in the country threats of armed rebellion should be indulged in and that stories of the
 co operation of the indians should be put in circulaticn as they now are the herald the herald sensibly dismisses
 these idle rumors in circulation because of riel s presence with the following â€˜ the peonle are under no disabilities
 that cannot be redressed by constitutional means to oxcite the indians to acts of violence for purposes of revenge for
 real or fancied wrongs is a thing that will not be permitted by the government or the settlers this is
 the common sense view so long as riel conducts himself as a lawabiding sitizen we cannot see any reason why
 his presence should be feared ho may mean well enough notwithstanding the past calgary nor wester july 22 1884 the

 follow this attraction which in itself has no his course in alberta in recent years seems torical associations to indicate
 a lack of interest on the part however the real success of the fort of our elected representatives and as
