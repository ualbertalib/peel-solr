 an unmarked grave in the cemetery of batoche near the church of st antoine de padoue on the banks of
 the historic south saskatchewan river few know the exact location of his burial spot yet dumont was one of the
 most colorful and significant characters to gallop his horse across the western plains hunter indian fighter peacemaker whiskey trader guide
 showman and guerilla general he seems to have made an indelible impression upon all with whom he came into contact
 almost every history book or memoir written about the west contains some reference to him but despite this popularity little
 is known about him his grandfather is reputed to have been jean baptiste dumont who came west in the early
 1790 s and married a sarcee corbeau woman they were said to have had three sons isidore gabriel and jean
 these sons each left their mark upon the story of western canada gabriel was noted for his hunting and drinking
 ability and also for his violent temper he was married at lac sainte anne mission in 1842 there seems to
 have been little communication between him and the other dumonts jean the third son appears frequently as a close companion
 of his elder brother isidore he was a member of the st laurent colony of metis and signed treaty no
 6 at fort carlton in 1876 he was also a noted hunter and peacemaker the eldest son isidore who became
 known among the crees as aicaw pow the stander settled in red river and married louise laframboise sometime around 1833
 34 they had at least eleven children five girls and six boys gabriel the subject of this paper was fourth
 in the family and was born somewhere between 1836 and 1838 it is suspected that he was named gabriel after
 his fighting and drinking uncle isidore appears on the red river census of 1838 as a native catholic owning a
 house a barn three horses two mares two calves one harrow four carts one canoe and three acres of land
 under cultivation 2 two years later he is shown as living with his father in law and having given up
 farming shortly after 1840 the dumont clan moved to the fort pitt fort edmonton area where isidore traded with the
 indians and bought supplies from the hudson s bay company however ‘ giraud m le metis cunadien paris 1945 pp

 tally ho lethbridge has gone wild over fox hunting the first experience of this invigorating sport which the citizens of
 lethbridge have enjoyed was on a recent sunday a number of the wily doubters had been previously captured and on
 this particular sunday the town turned out almost en masse to give chase as many as could get anything in
 the shape of an animal with four legs went to the meet mounted while thcre was also a pretty liberal
 turnout of single and double drivers arrived on the spot the foxes were let out one by one and the
 pack of hounds from fox terriers up to newfoundlands let loose then the fun began one prominent lethbridge citizen who
 was driving was overcome by intense excitement and entering into the spirit of the thing threw off his coat and
 with a loud whcop sprang out of the wagon and careened wildly over the prairie in pursuit of the fox
 it is not known whether he was in at the death or not another fox turned townward and arrived followed
 by a wildly enthusiastic crowd both mounted and driving just as the children were going to sunday school the fever
 seized the latter the fo t darted across the railway track and the children joined pell mell in the pursuit
 religiously inclined people felt much shocked and we hear that the matter was reported to the police it is hinted
 however that it is not only the ungodly of l thbridge who take a keen interest in fox hunting even
 if the meet does take place on a sunday fort macleod gazette dec 6 1889 an unwilling diary by hugh
 a dempsey in the 1880 s western canada had an air of informality that extended at times even into the
 government service but possibly nothing can quite compare with two faded reports for january and february 1884 given by w
 c mccord farm instructor on the blood indian reserve to cecil denny the agent for all of treaty seven mccord
 believed that monthly re tragic picture of the blood indians at ports were a waste of paper ink and that
 time time the bloods had always been buffalo hunters but in 1881 the last of the sir he said i
 am convinced this great herds were destroyed and the report will never be read and it makes indians were forced
 to live on their mea great deal of work as i keep a daily serve and accept small rations of
 beef journal and this has to be copied out of and flour disease and poverty soon it and i am
 not an expert with a pen swept through their camps and many the sooner i start a daily newspaper indians
 died before the tribe finally on the reserve the easier it will be for became accustomed to the new existence
 me to give you an exact account of what mccord s diary reflects some of the transpired and i am
 sure that i can find pathos of their plight while undergoing material enough however knowing this period of transition the
 ways of the government he con in submitting his february report cluded the powers that be says so and mccord
 attached the following letter it must he done dated feb 29 1884 mccord was a popular and well i have
 the honor to present you known figure in southern alberta he my report for this month hoping had joined the
 indian department in you will find it interesting enough 1882 as an issuer and later became farm to read it
 through instructor which meant that he was in now sir i will tell you how and charge of the whole
 reserve at that when we ration the indians out time there was one indian agent for all here of course
 you know but i reserves in southern alberta and the think that i had better tell you all farm instructors
 lived on the reserves about it and then you will always and kept peace among the indians he know when
 ration days come had opened the first wagon road through every monday i issue flour to the the crowsnest pass
 and later when al whole camp the year round every berta became too civilized for him he tuesday i issue
 beef or bacon for moved to the wilds of alaska tuesday and wednesday every in reading mccord s diaries for
 thursday i issue beef for thursday january and february it will be seen and friday and every saturday i that
 he performed operations acted as issue beef for saturday sunday an arbitrator in local disputes per and monday then commences
 the formed divorces and was generally a same rotation over again of flour jack of all trades on monday and
 so forth cattle is slaughtered just now on mondays unfortunately mccord s notes have and fridays and in very warm
 become very faded in passing years and weather i have to issue the beef parts of them now are unreadable
 but the same day it is killed otherwise enough of them can be followed to re it would not keep
 the indians has veal both mccord s impatience and the no trouble trying to keep it mr demp tey is

 its youth the men who came to canada s northland to seek furs could not leave behind all the finer
 mcres of their fatherland for courage and morale are nearrelatives they have never been accused of seeking to become nation
 builders in fact they were generally indifferent or definitely opposed to all forms of settlement and lo all efforts of
 development of the natural resources around them yet in spite of themselves they were true pioneers of civilization real trail
 blazers living as they did in touch with the elemental forces of nature and with the red men life was
 a constant challenge a real adventure calling for courage initiative and endurance the indians it must be remembered were important
 factors in the fur trade the dignity and honor of many of the chiefs lifted the trade out of the
 barbarous the natural grace of the indian even when begging for a trifle has seldom been properly appreciated by the
 white man another important link in the fur trade was the missionary whose influence on both the whites and the
 natives in many cases did much to increase the returns as an instance of this influence at norway house the
 natives used to bring in nine bales of furs in the season but after the arrival of the missionaries the
 total was increased to 90 bales largely through the changed attitude of the indians to firewat em these men traders
 indians and missionaries working together spun many ol the threads that make the warp and woof of our national life
 of today even though one is unable to unravel and disclose all those subtle influences thus while we try to
 understand these men and the work they did we will find ourselves disposed to lift our hats in ctppreciation of
 the heritage they have left us sir wilfred grenfell the noted missionary in the labrador once said the most important
 product of the codfish is the character of the men who spend their lives in catching him if that is
 true of the cod the principle is even more true of the beaver its influence upon the nobility of england
 was such that it made england determined to win canada from her ancient rival she did this symbolical of the
