 originals and dedicated themselves to the ideals of service and sacrifice which have become a regimental tradition a monument was 
 dedicated not in memory of dead men but as a reminder to the present of the standard of devotion to 
 duty which every patricia must meet the dedication service was arranged by the ist battalion briga dier a hamilton gault

 the history covers the period between the two world wars three years of training and of waiting in great britain 
 the sicilian and italian campaigns the closing weeks of the war in northwestern europe the years of re organization after 
 the second world war the service of first second and third battalions in korea and the tours of garrison duty

 patricia spirit his tale will assist many old patricias in reliving times gone by the book is interesting and readable 
 even to a non military reader though it may deal with the doldrum days before 1937 or the courageous but 
 costly attack by the patricias in the hitler line colonel stevens has not only managed to detail the activities of 
 the patricias but he also provides sufficient background information that his work will be a creditable reference on the italian 
 and korean campaigns of the method of presentation the historian lieut colonel g r stevens obe writes there are two 
 ways to write a military history the definitive and the intimate the definitive approach concentrates on technical performances the intimate 
 approach on personal performances there are some very good canadian unit histories of both types including those of the hastings 
 and prince edward regiment of the 48th high 
 the patrician 12 landers of canada and of lord strathcona s horse in tne case of the patricias i have 
 tried to reproduce the blend of the definitive and the intimate which proved popular in my indian army histories the 
 story will be read by generations of patricias to come i therefore felt that it should contain in addition to 
 details of patricias performances 0:perform 0:ances a certain amount of background material of military purposes and attitudes but in addition 
 to these definitive requirements i have introduced wherever possible intimate narratives of how individual patricias fought and felt in order 
 to preserve a record of the behaviour that has contributed to the tradition of the regiment the regiment can be 
 assured that the latest volume will be indeed worthy of a place alongside volumes i and 11 honours and awards

 the patrician 14 first battalion report training after the soltau concentration the unit returned to fort macleod on 28 aug 
 and settled down to the task of cleaning and repairing equipment in preparation for the handover to 2qor of c 
 and rotation to canada the brigade commander brig roger rowley dso cd had laid on a very high standard for 
 the changeover which required 100 percent effort by all ranks training was curtailed as equipment had to be frozen for 
 accounting and inspection purposes two courses on support weapons and a junior leaders course were completed during this period and 
 our operational standard was raised even higher by the addition of several group one and two s army day on 
 20 21 sep the unit celebrated its first army day the brigade plan was to demonstrate the calibre of its 
 troops to the german people for our part we staged a track and field meet a weapons display a march 
 through the streets of hemer and held church parades in the local german churches these events were very effective in 
 their purpose and also allowed the german population in our area to have a last look at the battalion frezenberg 
 memorial on 1 oct a ceremony was held near ypres belgium to dedicate the frezenberg memorial a mixed formal dinner 
 in honour of brig a hamilton gault dso ed cd was held at the hotel metropole brussels on 30 sept 
 and was attended by several old originals exmembers 0:ex 0:members of ppcli and serving officers among those present were brig 
 and mrs gault brig and mrs agnew lt col niven lt col pearson lt col lindsay and lcpl milne on 
 the morning of 1 oct many of the officers and men of the battalion visited the allied war cemeteries around 
 ypres accompanied by sgt paddy o connell another old original who pointed out many interesting features in the countryside and 
 explained what happened there after this a luncheon attended by all ranks and their wives was held at the rotisserie 
 st nicola ypres the mayor of ypres presented souvenirs which consisted of black cats for the ladies and medallions for 
 the men prior to the dedication ceremony brig gault inspected a guard of honour consisting of three officers and sixty 
 men commanded by major e d mcphail cd in a very moving and impressive ceremony he then planted the canadian 
 maple tree which will form the centre of the frezenberg memorial 
 the patrician 15 rotation on 4 oct the long awaited rotation commenced with the departure 0:de 0:parture of the single 
 personnel of the advance party it was no longer a thought but a reality reminiscence of the past two years 
 became common chatter and after the usual reappraisals and soulsearching 0:soul 0:searching we all felt very proud of the battalion 
 s achievements in germany the two year plan for training had succeeded in producing a highly effective unit in which 
 every man was qualified to perform his role in battle this was perhaps the highest operational standard the battalion has 
 ever attained with rotation under way drafts left germany at intervals until on 15 dec the last remaining patricia in 
 the person of our adjutant capt r h graham cd left for home patricias return to work point barracks after 
 a period of 18 years absence during which the battalion has seen service in two wars and a two year 
 tour of duty in nato the patricias returned to work point barracks the advance party headed by major c v 
 lilley mc cd arrived on 4 nov to find the nucleus of an advance party already on the spot this 
 group was under command of capt a v stoppa who had gathered 0:gath 0:ered considerable information about the area which 
 proved invaluable to the advance party the two main problems to be solved were first to fit the battalion 0:bat 
 0:talion into work point barracks which was not designed to accommodate 0:accommo 0:date a battalion the second was to take 
 over barrack stores from hq esquimalt garrison and then to move all the stores and equipment received from the 2 
 qor of c from gordon head to work point foresight on the part of lt col j c cave cd 
 commandant of esquimalt garrison in having renovation of the old barrack block begun 0:be 0:gun prior to the arrival of 
 the advance party avoided a difficult situation 0:situ 0:ation in barrack room space lt col cave recalled to us the 
 days when he was quartered in this same building while serving with b company before world war 11 history has 
 a habit of repeating itself as b company is once again quartered in this barrack block the other problems of 
 accommodation were soon solved the trick now is to marry off enough of the new soldiers coming into the battalion 
 so that we won t run short of bed space in the barracks weapons and equipment are now becoming available 
 thanks to a big job well done by the qm staff seventy five of our married personnel have been able 
 to get pmqs very little difficulty is being experienced in obtaining suitable private accommodation for the others the people of 
 the island have given us a warm welcome home and are not taking advantage of the sudden demand for housing 
 accommodation comparable to pmqs can be had for between ninety and one hundred dollars a month 
 the patrician 16 the two main training areas mary hill and albert head are fifteen and ten miles respectively from 
 camp just a good march distance 0:dis 0:tance work point boasts an excellent 30 yard range to augment this there 
 are the ranges at heal s and nanaimo approval has been given for the construction of a parade square large 
 enough to troop on and a new sports field which will include a 440 yard cinder track the use of 
 the gym and swimming pool at naden once a week for each company and recreational training such as golf and 
 fishing the year round should make this a paradise indeed shortly after the arrival of the advance party the officers 
 were invited to a cocktail party by major paddy crofton at his home where they were able to visit with 
 brig colquhoun before his departure 0:de 0:parture for europe sports the brigade sports programme was finalized before sautau concentration 0:con 
 0:centration and to alleviate the itching of gang plank fever the battalion 0:bat 0:talion interest turned to inter company football 
 and track and field inter company track and field interest in this event was stimulated when the texas bar a 
 resort well known to ppcli personnel who have served in germany presented a magnificent trophy to be awarded to the 
 company with the highest aggregate points in inter company sports at the time of presentation a and d companies were 
 locked in the lead for the year s athletic activities while c company trailed by two points b company by 
 four points and sp company by five points this meant that the winners of the track and field meet would 
 become the first possessors of the tb trophy the meet was held 20 21 sept in conjunction with our army 
 day celebrations c company led by such stalwarts as zoboski muszynski 0:muszyn 0:ski leighton marke lunde and crawford walked away 
 from the rest of the field to take the battalion track and field trophy and the texas bar trophy award 
 mrs t de faye presented prizes to the individual and team winners 0:win 0:ners and to the british german and 
 bundeswehr relay teams that competed in our invitation medley relay inter company football this mad game was again the battalion 
 s most popular intercompany 0:inter 0:company sport and the medical officer s headache as six brawny enthusiastic sometimes skillful teams 
 took to the field for some thinly disguised mayhem the rules again said tag football but this was a rule 
 more honoured in the book as ferocious blocking became equally ferocious tackling the league opened fast with hq huskies and 
 a company looking like the class of the league while c company and sp company bashed along in the two 
 game total point series first place a company went down in two hard fought games to third place hq huskies 
 and sp 
 the patrician 17 lost out to c company after coming very close in an exciting second game this put hq

 led by ppcli band newly arrived in deutschland cpl westrup of the mortar platoon was designated miss french grey cup 
 by mrs t de faye on the basis of feminine charms and a cute french poodle the game got under

 was ended cpl villiger scored a touchdown to put c company ahead seven to one mitchell scored a touchdown in 
 the second quarter and kicked a field good while webster also scored to give hq the lead 16 to 7 
 at the half after a half time show by ppcli band cpl villiger took the second half kickoff and ran 
 75 yards for a td to put the cyclones back in the game from here on c company never looked 
 back as cpl anderson scored a major and kearsley booted a field goal two rouges and two converts to give

 a report on an institute to list the social activities of the institute over the period under discussion 0:dis 0:cussion 
 describing in poetic language the events as they took place the reason for this presumably is that nothing is of 
 much interest to anybody for example in this report we could describe the frenzied activities of the mess committee in 
 packing up the non public property and handing over what remained to the qor of c we might mention such 
 things as the crate for the regimental plaque being a quarter of an inch too short but this unfortunately is 
 of interest only to those poor souls who were involved obviously the secret to writing an interesting report is to 
 write something which appeals to the reader and the only way to do this unless you are writing news is 
 to mention as many names as possible then at least the individuals who see their names in print are interested 
 in what they are reading it will be interesting to see how much of this padding the editor cuts out 
 probably all editor s note you wrote it it is impossible to mention the names of all those who participated 
 in the spa s mess dinner held on 6 august we could perhaps start at the top with rsm rowley 
 but he is probably still trying to forget that evening we might even descend in the lists to lcpl de 
 faye but looking back we remember that he was despatched to the unit guardroom by the rsm one of the 
 company ordely sergeants 0:ser 0:geants is said to have phoned the orderly officer saying that the orderly officer might be 
 interested in knowing that maj mcphail and capt fafard had just placed the co in close custody in the guardroom 
 0:guard 0:room perhaps the remaining incidents of that dinner are better left unmentioned as a matter of fact few of 
 the participants could have told you much about it the next day we now come to the sad affair of 
 the desertion gary hunt was due to be married on the 14 september and in accordance with custom he was 
 given a mock trial at the stag party on the 10th he was accused among other things of desertion and 
 it was a foregone conclusion that he was guilty his punishment at least it was supposed 0:sup 0:posed to be 
 a punishment was that frightful ordeal the trooping 
 the patrician 20 funnily enough his faithful charger doug bell seemed to suffer far worse agonies and did not reappear 
 on the scene for some time incidentally 0:in 0:cidentally had rsm austin seen bob muir that evening he would have 
 sworn he was looking in a mirror a couple of weeks after this we welcomed the advance party of the 
 2 qor of c in recognition of the fact that for many of them germany was a strange land we 
 tried to show them a few things about the country to this end the mess was decorated in a schutzen 
 fest motif including a barrel of beer many of us were closely watching 0:watch 0:ing our guests to see what 
 effect the renowned german beer had on them unhappily it seemed to have no more effect on them than it 
 did on us this may have been a result of the good food served as a buffet in germany style 
 i e bockwurst etc despite the confusion caused by lost baggage motel living etc a successful new year s ball 
 was held in the mess numerous distinguished 0:dis 0:tinguished guests were in attendance including the honourable george r pearkes minister 
 of national defence and mrs pearkes many members claim that this year s ball created a record for ending early 
 there must be something to this salt air after all bright and early on 1 jan the first group of 
 callers arrived at the mess and were greeted with the usual noggin and what is apparently 0:appar 0:ently a tradition 
 at work point barracks clam chowder approximately 0:approxim 0:ately 200 callers were received between 0930 and 1130 hrs which made 
 it quite a morning thirty five officers from hmcs naden were entertained during the first week of january at a 
 beer and oyster party appetites and thirsts were good and the quantity of refreshments consumed was large later in the 
 evening various physical contests were conducted which resulted in peter maione becoming the undisputed inter service pogo stick champion of 
 victoria much to everyone s amusement and to out utter amazement our team of stalwarts soundly trounced the navy in 
 a boat race winning by a full length to say that the eveningwas 0:evening 0:was a success would be an 
 understatement the same sort of entertainment 0:enter 0:tainment was held on 7 feb in honour of the honorary and associate 
 members while the sports were much less violent the evening was both entertaining and strenuous now that the battalion is 
 fairly well settled we can look around and take stock of our surroundings various adjectives could be used to describe 
 the mess varying from charming through pleasant to quaint the building is an old one and is on a point 
 overlooking the entrance to victoria harbour in the distance it is possible depending on the degree of clag to see 
 the mountains of the olympic national park or the lights of port angeles the air is warm and balmy and 
 this promises 0:prom 0:ises to be an extremely pleasant location in which to do a tour of duty or more 
 
 the patrician 21 sergeants mess the sergeants mess was closed in fort macleod during the greater part of august while 
 the battalion was concentrated in soltau training area a field mess was opened in soltau for the convenience of the 
 members on the night of 31 august a social evening held in the mess was enjoyed by the members and 
 their ladies dancing was followed by an excellent supper at midnight a dining in night for members and their ladies 
 was held in the mess friday 13 sep the occasion was used to present a small memento to several of 
 the members who were leaving the battalion these members are sgt baird sc rcamc sgt king jm rcasc sgt vold 
 ge rcasc l sgt snook kr rcapc one of the honorary members of the mess herr otto hegel emden presented 
 the mess with a bronze eagle of historic nature the rsm in accepting this eagle stated that it would always 
 have a place of honour in the sergeants mess the music that followed the dinner was supplied by the dance 
 band from the royal norfolk regiment on 21 sep at 1200 hrs major w m w wilson and mrs wilson 
 had a farewell visit with the members of the mess prior to leaving the unit both major and mrs wilson 
 thanked the members of the mess sincerely for the many enjoyable events in which they had participated 0:par 0:ticipated a 
 stag party to welcome warrant officers and senior ncos of the 2 qor of c was held 25 sep 1957 
 it was indeed a pleasure to see to many old comrades in arms and we hope they are enjoying mess 
 life in fort macleod after a great deal of bartering buying and horse trading the large blue rca sgts wos 
 mess sign was quietly removed from it s anchorage on ist dec 1957 and the patricias officially took over at 
 work point barracks a great deal of hand shaking has been prominent with introductions 0:introduc 0:tions and goodbyes in the 
 last two months the mess was sorry to have to say goodbye to capt gardner although he among a good 
 number of the members got away in the traditional manner on saturday 0:satur 0:day 21 dec the sergeants mess was 
 at home to approximately 40 members of the garrison this was done in the traditional manner and enjoyed by all 
 the officers mess was at home to us on 28 dec and it was found that sergeants outnumbered the officers 
 approximately 10 to 1 a gala ball was held new year s eve and it was a huge success the 
 old timers stated it was the best in many a year although numerous members have left the mess our members 
 have not been noticeably decreased due to the large influx of associate and honorary members we are not accustomed to 
 such a large membership 0:mem 0:bership and we are looking forward to many more good times with our new members 
 
 the patrician 22 corporals mess during the month of july the mess said auf weidershien to cpls dunsmore and redden 
 who returned to canada and cpl shaughnessy 0:shaugh 0:nessy who left for the c pro c we had an emergency 
 mess meeting on the 11th of july and bought a fine radio and record player which was brought back to 
 work point barracks the highlight of the month was the hard times dance on the 13th of july which was 
 held in the gym our hats are off to the pmc and all those who worked so hard to make 
 the evening so enjoyable 0:enjoy 0:able on 31 july cpl birwert replaced cpl swanson as pmc lcpl bordeleau took over 
 the job of secretary from cpl fullerton and lcpl ellis turned over the money and paper work of treasurer to 
 cpl mac kenzie there was no change in the v pmc and it is still held by cpl prokopishin soltau 
 and the mess lay dormant from 10 to 24 of august after two weeks of splendid training we finally got 
 back into the groove again by holding our first mess dinner on 30 aug the preparation for this event was 
 extensive and rather difficult as it was the first of its kind that had ever been attempted in our mess 
 however it went off extremely well and the 35 guests officers wos and sgts remarked favourably on it we for 
 our part enjoyed ourselves immensely 0:im 0:mensely and fully intend to have another one soon on the arrival of the 
 2qor of c advance party we had a stag in the mess and introduced them to becks and prosit our 
 last official function in germany was a stag for those members 0:mem 0:bers leaving on the advance party for canada 
 as our pmc and treasurer left at this time lcpl bordeleau took over the administration of the mess and turned 
 it over to the 2 qor of c in october the mess reopened at work point barracks in november 1957 
 it took only a few days to move the furniture back in hang the drapes and lay in a stock 
 of bar supplies as soon as our furniture arrived from germany it began to look more like home although we 
 were operating on a shoestring we managed to buy a couple of hundred do lars worth of equipment from the 
 previous tenants including such vital items and beer taps and glass washers the mess now offers its members a weekly 
 movie on friday nights facilities for cards cribbage checkers darts and most important a place to bring one s lady 
 friend of an evening or just quietly scoff a schooner of ale we also have a tv set but it 
 isn t much use as we can only net into eight stations out here times are tough haven t had 
 to shovel any snow away from the entrance either

 officers and sergeants a regimental first we believe 0:be 0:lieve it was very well attended and enjoyed by all new

 army day with a dance drawings were placed around the walls showing soldiers in many poses reminding one of the 
 cartoons 0:car 0:toons in the old maple leaf these drawings along with streamers and balloons contributed to make the decorations

 sports including cpl noel s great showing in the international amateur 0:ama 0:teur boxing tournament at seattle and the fine 
 representation that our hockey and volleyball teams have given the battalion in local civilian leagues we have just taken over 
 the magnificent new pt building and it provides us now with a fine gymnasium and other facilities this has already 
 become a centre of sporting activities hockey the hockey team played in the edmonton district hockey league intermediate b and 
 represented the battalion very well they finished fourth in the league and in the play offs gave the champion edson 
 athletics a hard fight only losing 1 2 in games after two thrilling overtime games 
 the patrician 33 a civilian league does not suit us as the games are played over a scattered area and 
 most of them on outdoor rinks making it difficult for our fans to properly support the team however a service 
 league is being organized now and this should provide plenty of fast and furious hockey for our fans next season 
 boxing the past year has proved to be a most successful one for our boxers the highlight of the year 
 was the recognition of cpl noel as one of canada s better amateur boxers he won the best loser trophy

 the patrician 35 looking forward during the spring and early summer months the battalion training 0:train 0:ing programme will switch 
 from airborne and arctic warfare to field training culminating in a summer concentration in camp wainwright reflections on exercise assiniboine 
 and bulldog pte 2 ppcli since this was my first winter with the battalion i didn t know what to 
 expect when we were told that we were going to take winter training and then take part in two exercises 
 assiniboine and bulldog 0:bull 0:dog iv the wheels said this was a good thing and although the idea of sleeping 
 in a tent in freezing weather didn t appeal to me i was ready to give it a try we 
 started off in december by being issued more kit than i or a mule could carry then it took us 
 a week to find out how we wore it and packed it it was still more than a mule could 
 carry but we carried it i also became proficient in lighting stoves and lamps etc cpl h chewed me out 
 just once for trying to thaw the ground with a gasoline fire guess the lamp must have leaked i also 
 found myself harnessed and pulling a contraption the army loosely refers to as a toboggan we would daily stow all 
 our gear tent etc on the thing put on our mule load and then pull like horses just so we 
 wouldn t find this too easy they also made us wear snowshoes this would have been a little easier if 
 there had been more than an inch of snow on the 20th of january we finally climbed into trucks and 
 set off for ft assiniboine after a cramped ride of some one hundred miles we arrived in the assiniboine forest 
 reserve near goose lake at last we were in the wilds we even had a foot of snow on which 
 to pull our toboggans and our snowshoes became of more use than just a means of upsetting us we made 
 camp on the edge of the lake rations were issued we all sat around the tent pole just like a 
 christmas tree opening ration boxes and sampling this and that this short sojourn being rudely interrupted by our tent group 
 leader cpl b who insisted 0:in 0:sisted on us completing our tent pitching and snow defences for five days orders 
 and counter orders were issued snowshoes off snowshoes on tents up tents down parkas on parkas off and so on 
 after a while we found we could do some of these things in our sleep and did 
 the patrician 36 on the final night of the exercise our section commander told us that we were being launched 
 into a night operation against an enemyparachute 0:enemy 0:parachute company hiding in the hills so into tne blackness we marched 
 and marched butting heads on unexpected halts yearning for a smoke sweating in the unseasonable warmth our company was providing 
 the firm base while b company was out patrolling looking for the enemy once at the firm base at midnight 
 we managed 0:man 0:aged to make ourselves comfortable we pitched our tent cooked a brew and some of us even 
 got a nap we hoped b company wouldn t find the enemy and we could rest easy for the night 
 but luck wasn t with us again we marched this time without packs or toboggans all this comfort i was 
 sure the brass had gone nuts we finally arrived after gallons more sweat at b company s position somehow b 
 company patrols had stumbled on the enemy position 0:posi 0:tion and of course this meant more marching and finally at 
 dawn a bayonet charge onto the enemy s position at this point the exercise was packed up and we all 
 returned to goose lake the fishing resort of c company in the afternoon we all became deep freeze sardines in 
 our 2 2 ton limousines arriving back in the barracks around supper time on the 24th of january from then 
 on we continued training polishing off my platoon sergeant said but i wasn t too sure of the polishing in 
 early february we did a jump called bullpup this was an exercise designed to find out if you could locate 
 yourself in an area in which you should have been ten minutes ago our big exercise bulldog iv was now 
 quite close we found ourselves packing toboggans and marking them for the drop we even packed sand and marked it 
 as ammunition cpl s said we were to throw it in the enemy s eyes if need be on the 
 7th of february the co had us parade on the square dressed in our teddybear 0:teddy 0:bear white suits and 
 carrying all our equipment we were now ready for bulldog iv the exercise started on the 10th of february we 
 saw the co and his retinue of brass take off for headquarters western command where we presume he received his 
 orders on the same day we moved parachutes to namao air station and lined them up in a hangar later 
 in the day we received our first instructions apparently the queen s own were providing the opposition and for some 
 reason possibly unknown even to them were occupying a bald windswept hill aptly named lost hill at camp wainwright we 
 were to jump in some distance to the south west there we would mount a night operation against lost hill 
 we spent the 11th of february packing gear and receiving further briefings on the 12th we moved out to namao 
 around noon but the wind was high and the drop was cancelled for twenty four hours everyone cheered but it 
 only prolonged the needle 
 the patrician 37 exercise bulldog iv february 1958 we were given orders again and told we would drop on the 
 13th at 1530 hours on arrival at namao we were pulled stretched and thumped getting into our parachutes and assorted 
 gear just to make sure we couldnt get out we were fed large fat sandwiches with resultant 0:re 0:sultant bulges 
 between the harness straps despite being loaded with parachute weapon rucksack and sandwiches 0:sand 0:wiches we managed to walk stagger 
 or crawl to the thirteen cll9 aircraft the rcaf had so kindly provided takeoff in formation seemed rather hairy but 
 we managed to get off even though there were some doubtful hesitating stomach lurching starts the flight was uneventful our 
 aircraft drill seemed to go alright except we were given go while the doors were shut cpl o was rather 
 upset but the remainder of his stick would have bored a hole right through the fuselage or kicked the door 
 out if permitted we finally got out they did open the doors the air was fuli of parachutes the dz 
 didn t look too familiar but seemed to have a few more trees than we had anticipated despite trees bush 
 and hills we managed to land safely thanks to soft snow and it was a relief to get the equipment 
 off and have a good scratch 
 the patrician 38 on the ground they said one of the fellows had hung up on the aircraft and that 
 one of the officers had his parachute fall off his back at the door my corporal said it was amazing 
 the lengths a guy would go to to miss a winter exercise the temperature was away down around thirty five 
 below so we were sure happy to get our toboggans unless it was one filled with sand the heavy drop 
 platform was a spectacular sight when dropped one fellow was so enthralled he tried to break its fall again we 
 marched across country established another firm base we got our tents up had a brew on and almost comfortable when 
 we were told that the enemy had been located and we were to attack him at dawn several of the 
 platoon immediately volunteered as casualties rumor had it that casualties were flown out to namao and a warm hospital bed 
 unfortunately none of the umpires considered casualties 0:casual 0:ties were necessary at this point after a good solid march in 
 freezing wind and several lengthy waits we charged the enemy in true us cavalry style that would have done general 
 custer proud the queen s own were relieved that we had finally found them they had moved from lost hill 
 to another location called tower hill and they were just as cold as we were and didn t want the 
 scheme prolonged the exercise was called off prematurely someone said but we were content to move back to our tents 
 where we could at least eat and try to get some sleep we were all happy to see our barrack 
 room again on the 15th of february our beds and food in the mess hall never looked so good later

 recorded in any paper or magazine that the rifle brigade with its 27 vc s holds the greatest number of 
 awards of any regiment of the british army a list of riflemen vc s was not included in the article

 100 high school boys over 16 years of age and with the help of 23 militia group and 2nd battalion 
 trained these boys to a high standard under what came to be known as the young soldier training scheme 
 the patrician 48 in the fall of 1957 it was decided that all of these boys who wished to further 
 their military training should be given the opportunity 0:oppor 0:tunity to do so and they were all invited to renew 
 their association with the regiment about 75 of the young soldiers returned for training and were formed into a support 
 company under the command of major ed pritchard the training of support company was undertaken on each saturday 0:sat 0:urday 
 and here again we received generous support and assistance from the 2nd battalion right up until christmas support company went 
 out to the hamilton gault barracks where 2nd battalion instructors 0:in 0:structors gave them instruction in the various infantry support

 wish to join the regiment and c company under command of capt f g clare took shape c coy now 
 has about 75 soldiers in training two platoons doing leading infantrymen course and one recruit platoon these young soldiers owe 
 much of their efficiency and keeness to those instructors loaned by 2nd battalion early this year it became apparent that

 the appointment of lt f dorsey as cto was certainly a fortunate day for the corps lt dorsey has worked 
 very hard in bringing the corps up to high standard of training which is enjoyed by the boys of griesbach 
 and the surrounding district our thanks goes also to cpl ortleib who is working in the cadet qm stores and 
 to the ncos and instructors who give of their time to assist in this youth movement winter training wednesday nights 
 the new drill hall and lecture training building in the hamilton gault barracks certainly has added to our cadet training 
 the syllabus for parade nights has been packed full with not only the standard training but highlighted by airborne training 
 signals and sports we are still very hopeful of an airplane ride to complete our airborne training ranges a full 
 program has been in operation on the ranges at both the prince of wales armouries and griesbach barracks many shoots 
 have been entered with a goodly number of our boys winning prizes awards have also been won in recreational shooting 
 a 22 rifle and a number of cups are being purchased as prizes for further competition within the corps cadet 
 band monday night is band night being able to receive instruction on a band instrument is we believe very beneficial 
 to a boy it is hoped that more boys will take advantage of this opportunity 0:oppor 0:tunity the climax for

 the patrician 50 province of alberta jasper national park far away fields look greener alberta has some of north ameri 
 cas loveliest holiday grounds in its very own backyard but sometimes people are so busy hurrying to see other far 
 away attractions on theii annual holidays that they haven t time to consider the beauties of their own province there 
 s banff national park second largest national park in canada which attracts thousands of tourists annually from all over the 
 world not to mention the movie crews who have been filming the majestic peaks lacy waterfalls and clear blue lakes 
 as backgrounds for some of their technicolor movies then there s waterton lakes park in the south of the province 
 and of course jasper national park perhaps not quite so well known in other parts of the world as is 
 banff but larger in size it s 4200 square miles of awesome mountain scenery which extends along the eastern slope 
 of the canadian rockies in the western part of the province 0:prov 0:ince banff national park is south of jasper 
 while on the west over the continental divide in b c lies mount robson provincial park jasper is a breathtakingly 
 beautiful park that carries with it a long history of exploration stretching from the french canadian boatmen 0:boat 0:men to 
 the cariboo gold rush stragglers today it stands like some brave page from alberta s past unmarred by the commerce 
 of time it s a serene undisturbed mountain playground with a silent peaceful and awe inspiring beauty jasper park seems 
 to be a milk toast name for this mountain retreat 0:re 0:treat of rough parallel ranges running from southeast to 
 northwest the folds and upheavals in the rock are visible everywhere as are evidences of the erosion caused mainly by 
 the recession of the glaciers which once filled the valleys the broad valley of the athabasca river cuts through these 
 ranges from south to northeast and the main tributaries 0:tribu 0:taries of the athabasca the sunwapta whirlpool miette maligne snaring 
 rock and snake indian rivers flow through the park area but the name of the park doesn t seem so 
 strange when you find how it came about it seems that years ago jasper hawes a big fair haired factor 
 for the northwestern fur trading company lived in what is now jasper park in a one room shack which was 
 the only habitation 
 the patrician 51 on a long day s journey he and his indian wife always made everyone 0:every 0:one welcome 
 whether they were trapper adventuresome nobleman explorer or missionary for supper the travellers were served freshly caught brook trout whole 
 barbecued lynx or sizzling buffalo steaks and after a friendly exchange of the latest news would lie down to sleep 
 on beds of grizzley bear pelts the kindness and hospitality of jasper became known far and wide and the place 
 was spoken of as jasper s house even after jasper vanished mysteriously in 1813 his name and hospitable reputation 0:reputa 
 0:tion remained as the valley s chief assets lewis james swift was the next settler in the park coming into 
 the wide valley of the athabasca with his packtrain from fort edmonton 0:edmon 0:ton in 1892 jasper house which for 
 a while had become a hudson s bay trading post but had been abandoned in 1884 now consisted of three 
 ramshackle buildings swift repaired one and for two years ran a trading post on the old site in the meantime 
 marcus smith ran a line of survey for the chief engineer of the railways from kamloops up the north thompson 
 river and through yellowhead pass into jasper park swift found the survey stakes decided they marked an ideal place for 
 a railway terminal and ffled on 160 acres nearby as a homestead 0:home 0:stead he built a house on this 
 homestead lived happily there in solitude for a while then married in 1897 lewis james swift was an industrious man 
 who kept cattle and horses did a little irrigating and grew wheat barley and oats he even packed in a 
 small flour mill and built a water wheel to drive it jasper was declared a national park in 1907 at 
 which time the authorities tried to buy swift s land from him but he wouldn t sell finally in 1935 
 he sold out to mr wilby an english gentleman who planned to make it into a dude ranch wilby in 
 turn sold the land to a mr breed in 1952 and today this homestead of swift s is still private 
 property in the national park of jasper other names are written in the story of jasper s development along the 
 park s famous athabasca trail through its green valleys and across its wild rugged mountain passes came early explorers fur 
 traders and pioneers around 1814 brigades went back and forth along the athabasca trail twice a year they made picturesque 
 and sometimes rather bedraggled looking cavalcades who startled the mountain 0:moun 0:tain silence with jingling horse bells the gay chanson 
 of the voyageur or sharp words of command to the pack ponies they came from fort edmonton to jasper on 
 horseback in the summer with dog teams and snowshoes in the winter or they swept down the athabasca river their 
 painted birch bark canoes piled high with pelts and packs as a rule the boats were manned by french canadian 
 boatmen as dark as indians and brightly adorned with ribbons feathers colorful blanket surcoats leather leggings and ceintures fleshees the 
 steersman sat in the stern of the boat singing french canadian boat songs to the 
 the patrician 52 men to hurry them along the way these voyageurs of the west claimed they could live hard

 like sir george simpson reverend robert terrill rundle father pierre jean de smet and sir james hector who explored tin 
 southern rockies discovering vermilion and kicking horse passein 0:passe 0:in 1858 another group of men passed through the mountain beauty 
 ot jasper in 1860 too awed by their new found riches to notice the countn through which they were passing 
 they were m laurin and four others coming from the cariboo region over the yellowhead pass and east ward bound 
 with around 1600 dollars worth of gold this was on of the beginnings of the cariboo gold rush in 1862 
 another part came from the east toiling along the athabasca trail in the long tire some overland journey unused to 
 the rigors of travel in those earl 1 days some drowned in the fraser and thompson rivers while other perished 
 in the unyielding mountains beyond determined to conquer these mountains which split the continent the railways began exploring for good 
 cross country routes and eas passes through the mountains sir sanford fleming chief enginee of the c p r decided 
 yellowhead pass was the most suitable rout for the railway but the project was delayed by a change in govern

 jasper s biggest attractions is mount edith cavell whicl marks the great divide it was once called mountain of the 
 grand crossing then there s maligne canyon one of the world s most remarkable examples of erosion at some places 
 the canyon is so narrow you can jump across it if the sight of the boiling river two hundred feet
