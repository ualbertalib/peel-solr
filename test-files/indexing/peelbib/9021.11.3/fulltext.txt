 herald feb 1 1888 11 among the nomadic stoneys by george w pocaterra for over twenty years i was privileged
 by fate to share the life of the original nomad hunters of north america for anywhere from six weeks to
 several months each year i would like to convey something of the spirit engendered by such a way of life
 so different from our present one but atavistically a memory of the kind our ancestors also knew for untold thousands
 of years a left over of that original way of life can be seen in the still eager keenness of
 so many civilized men to o out and hunt wild game as if their very life depended on it on
 march fifth of this year sixty it had to serve as kitchen living room years have passed since i first
 set foot and bedroom combined until two years on the land that has become my home later when we did
 enlarge it considerand country ably after the cabin we had built a round corral but we soon realized the i
 arrived in winnipeg with a bliz need of building a barn for a milk cow zard raging and 3 75
 in my pocket the team and saddle horses before win i soon landed a job at a farm near glen
 ter set in across the highwood river boro in southern manitoba run by two and a little over a mile
 away was a scottish brothers from kilmarnock ayr very fine stand of tall and straightshire who were very kind to
 me but growing spruce trees it was there that life in manitoba then was very far from i had gone
 ear y one morning with axe being of the romantic kind i had ex and cross cut saw to cut
 the needed pected to find in the far west so trees branch them and saw them into the after a
 few months and with 78 saved required lengths after having readied i left for the real west of the large
 for hauling away a number of logs i ranches cowboys and the still real in drove my axe into one
 of the stumps dians of the mountains of southern al got out my tobacco pouch and rolled berta myself a
 cigarette of old judge tobacco as i struck a match and lit my i worked at several ranches to learn
 what i could of the requirements to cigarette i suddenly saw five indians enable me to start a place of
 my own standing behind me in a half circle a cousin much older than i who had every man with
 a rifle in the crook of his arm they looked like the indians lived in brazil and argentina joined me
 of deerslayer by fenimore cooper in the winter of 1904 5 and together we homesteaded on the banks of the
 high they were dressed in leggings breechclouts and blanket coats with the capote wood river a place i had already
 seen at the back and all had their hair done and admired the spring before and which became later the
 well known buf in tresses and some had either feathers or ermine skins woven into the tresses falo head ranch
 somehow i managed not to be startled it was shortly after we had started one living in those early conditions
 was that i met for the first time the real usually set and ready to meet sudden mountain indians then
 still living the crises one had to train oneself for old life of the original nomad hunters that i smiled
 and handing my tobacco of north america we were living in pouch to the nearest indian said have a 16
 x 14 log cabin which we had built a smoke with me all five broke sudsoon after taking up our
 homesteads denly into a smile and one of them said mr pocaterra came to western canada from italy shortly after
 the turn of the century and establi shed the now famous buffalo head ranch this article is from an address

 very young and so on this last custom was a result so i was always keen to grasp the sound
 of the rev mcdougall s early missionary of any strange words i found out that work amongst the stoneys what
 the indian had said meant this white man is not afraid of anything a few months after my first meeting
 with the five indians in the woods three thus started my friendship with the buffalo bulls took me on a

 far as i am concerned was at these the rockies when the only way was to lakes but now is
 completely spoiled by use the ancient indian trails the power dams the drowning of the marvellously beautiful islands and ex

 from the east become the greatest hunter of the tribe over a pass down the highwood river which actually happened
 at his pas to my old buffalo head ranch sing away he had a record of over 100 grizzlies to
 his credit his younger later that year 1906 with my indian brother still living was named moo i brother paul

 cabin so with the flour and other needed supplies and blankets can you needed groceries we had packed in on
 realize the heart breaking work entailed the toboggans we were fairly well supwhen you consider the terrible condi plied tions
 of the old trails with many fallen trees obstructing travel that the deep we apportioned to each other the snow
 did not always manage to cover territory where each was to trap mine was around both lakes and up the
 valley on the way up from where we had of the tributary from the east that flows parted with the
 horses we had had to into the kananaskis from the pass leadcamp out as we did not want to pack
 irig over it to the storm creek one of a tent which would have been too the sources of the
 highwood river the heavy all we had was a light canvas stream i was to trap along has since which
 we used as a wind break draped been named pocaterra creek my two on trees we always tried to camp
 in indian partners took for themselves the a very sheltered location we cut all elk river pass a 1 so
 the headwaters of trees for a space of 20 x 20 at least and the kananaskis and over the very
 high piled a lot of dry logs well in front set pass from the headwaters of the kanating our bedding
 on top of a thick layer naskis to the head of the palliser river of spruce boughs between the wind
 at that time a truly terrific undertaking break and the fire in the winter after two days traveling on snow
 once when my partners had gone shoes we arrived at the meadow near trapping to the palliser river valley where
 bolton creek used to flow into for about three weeks i was left absothe lower lake but which now is
 covered lutely alone i shall never forget what by water since the lake has been dam happened once when i
 decided to set med at the lower end the fall before some dead falls for marten on the south we
 had built a small log cabin with side of the upper lake where the mounthree narrow bunks the snow by
 then tam sides were covered by ancient forwas so deep and powdery that when est i snowshoed around the north
 side ever we had to go outside we had to of the lake and after looking carefully put on our
 snowshoes first so as not over the ground i noticed several to sink almost out of sight spotted wolf dog

 small a rhythm of its own and controlled and a sure sign that avalanches had de that it was becoming
 gradually clearer stroyed the ancient growth even though i realized then that my indian partners the signs pointed to the
 fact that a con were coming back but it must have been siderable time had elapsed since any almost a
 half an hour before they arslides had occured something suddenly rived they had found the snow condiwarned me not to
 hurry across i was tions terrible very deep and very still standing still trying to decide if i powdery they
 had found two mountain should go on and try my trapping luck goats lying dead on the ice of the
 palliser in a very promising location on the other river something never heard before side of the lake when a
 loud hissing the goats very seldom leave the high noise suddenly reverberated from high places and are extremely hardy up
 the mountain within seconds an enormous avalanche crashed through the we stayed on until the end of march forest not
 more than 100 yards ahead when we started on our way back to of me through a part of the
 forest that the reserve by that time we had run had never been hit before mighty trees very short of
 food we had killed a were snapped off and what surprised deer near the lake but it was very me
 was that the snow slide seemed to emaciated and was practically skin and roll contrary to what one would have
 bones that winter wiped out a high supposed would be the case it seemed percentage of the wild game in
 the to roll backward no doubt caused by mountains the rush of snow to enter the vacuum created by the
 onward rush of the great the first day on our return journey mass of snow also to my amazement we
 reached the place where we had left i saw great trees on the side of the slides part of a
 deer we had killed on our way being sucked towards it also by the up we had tied the meat
 high up a tree vacuum and being snapped off like and covered it with a light canvas we matches i
 do not need to say that i sorely needed that meat b ut met with returned to camp the way
 i had come disappointment some strong whirlwind quite frequent in the mountains one could ask why i had not tried
 had torn off the canvas and the butcher to cross over on the ice the reason birds had stripped off
 all the meat the was because the ice on the upper lake only thing left for us three very hungry
 was not safe as hot springs weakened men was the frozen tongue as it had it in places the indians
 had warned been protected by the skull and the marme of that when the calgary power row in the leg
 bones limited built the dam on the upper lake it took us another two days of very i understand that
 a bulldozer went heavy exhausting snowshoeing before through the ice and to the bottom we reached another previous camp from
 where the horses had turned back and while waiting for the return of my where we had carefully cached some
 friends i would leave in the morning flour and beans we had a full meal for my trapping grounds pack
 some that evening of bannock and boiled thing for lunch and travel around beans twenty miles on snowshoes to look
 over the dead falls i had set for martens the nearly evening next day i was trasnow was so deep
 that most of the fur yelling ahead breaking trail at the time bearers were travelling under the snow when glancing
 up to a high point on the so the catch was not very satisfactory trail ahead i saw a line
 of riders coming down towards us and soon we heard one evening i put on my snowshoes their welcoming shouts
 they were the to go to the creek for a pail of water families of my indian friends who had
 as i got back and was pulling off the become anxious at our being so late snowshoes i heard a
 faint swishing getting back considering the extremely sound from afar sounds in still very severe weather conditions of that winter
 cold weather travel unbelievable dis of 1906 7 when the temperature went tances i listened instantly and noticed down to
 60 below zero the teepees that the sound seemed cadenced to have were up in no time and soon we
 were 15 by the spring of 1907 the trio of trappers was ready to leave the kananaskis camp left to
 right are spotted wolf or paul amos george pocaterra and dog nose or elijah hunter by this time the party
 was short of food and had a difficult journey back to the stoney camps snug in a warm camp and
 enjoying a would already be good on the animals real good meal such as we had not had they would
 always try to be back for for quite some time the big gathering at christmas the next day we arrived
 at the in about the third week of september dians homes riding the extra horses they the stoneys of the
 bearspaw band had brought for us i can t remember arrived at the large meadow near where anything more heavenly
 at that time whiskey creek plunges into sullivan than the contrast of snowshoeing with creek a great number of lodges
 were a heavy pack on our backs and being soon up in a half circle and the place carried by
 a good and willing horse was dotted all over with about 1 000 soon after they gave me a horse
 and head of horses to the consternation of saddle to ride back to my buffalo head the neighbouring ranchers who
 thought ranch a long two days trip on the old they had the right to all the grass for stoney
 indian trail then still not fenced miles around their places they seemed off by the new settlers unable to realize
 that they were actually the next fall paul my indian brother the interlopers and not the indians who and i
 had arranged to go together on had been accustomed for hundreds of the big fall hunt which usually lasted years
 to think that the country was some months until each family had theirs the indians paul and his kimkilled enough
 game to dry a sufficient ily were amongst the band remained on supply of meat to last them through the
 that same camping grounds for a few cold winter months they also would days during which time each family try
 to catch a supply of fish which they group acquainted the others of the counwould smoke and also do some
 trapping try they were going to hunt over the at the end of the hunt when the fur group of
 a few related families i be 16 longed to usually started hunting soon the pack animals in small groups of
 two after they had arrived between the first or three all in single file and second range of the rockies
 on the upper highwood river from there they i shall never forget when isaac rollmoved a short day s ride
 every few in the mud our elderly leader suddenly days depending on what luck they had turned his horse aside
 and called me had if the kill had been abundant it beside him i had then already travelled was imperative
 for them to stop long with my indian friends for two years enough for the women to cut all the
 hunts as i joined him he said at ya zefresh meat up into long thin strips for ‘ ‘ aush

 smoked and dried re if i had travelled that way before i was ducing its weight to a fraction of
 what always riding at the head of the packit had been when still fresh and endow train ing it with
 absolute keeping qualities some of the well dried meat was at the indians always tried to camp times made into
 pemmican the pro fairly early in the afternoon so as to cedure was to pound the dried strips of be
 able to get the tepee up spruce meat until they were reduced to a h boughs for the beds arranged
 sufficient brous powdery substance this was firewcod cut and ready to use and the then mixed with semi dried berries
 in horses properly looked after somebody the mountains they would usually be was sure to go fishing to catch a
 mess mountain huckleberries then the whole of fresh trout for the next meal fires amount was put into a skin
 container would be started inside the tepees which and thoroughly mixed with the rendered were usually large enough to allow
 for fat taken from the animal killed i once several sleeping places between the fire kept some pemmican for over
 ten years and the canvas walls of the lodges before i ate it and it was still perfectly the women
 soon started mixing flour good being a very concentrated food with salt baking powder and water and it had great
 energizing powers kneaded the whole into a fairly stiff dough when ready glowing coals from on the hunt we went
 up the high the fire were raked back a round piece wood to its headwaters and over the of douqh
 about half an inch thick and pass down the valley of pocaterra creek the right size was put into a
 frying pan about half way down it we turned off on which flour had been sprinkled the on a very
 faint trail crossed the great pan was set up almost straight up and divide of the elk river pass and
 down down and kept in that position with a the steep southern slope to the lovely stick fitted into the
 handle the coals at elk river lakes soon after leaving the the back and the fire in front in the
 lakes the elk river valley was then over meantime a meal was cooked mostly of fifty years ago covered by
 a magnificent meat or fish forest now destroyed by fires that when hunting the indians would rise upper country was
 then hardly travelled early they used to say we shall at all even by the indians and the waken and
 rise when we can see the trail was extremely faint seven stars in the sky straight above us through the
 opening of the tepee the when on the trail the oldest and seven stars being the constellation of the most
 respected man rode usually at the great bear after breakfast the men head of the pack train at that long
 would go on the hunt usually a couple passed time of 55 years ago th group together but sometimes alone
 and if consisted of three families which had the signs were favourable they would about 30 head of horses between
 riding hunt until almost dusk or until they had and pack horses i usually was close made a kill in
 which case they cleaned behind the leader driving my two pack the animal of its offals to lighten its horses
 followed by the men boys and weight and then if at all possible they girls and the women driving the
 rest of would drag it near to where they had 17 in the autumn of 1908 the stoneys gathered at
 the mouth of whiskey creek in the high wood valley there were at least one thousand horses in camp much
 to the consternation of nearby ranchers tethered their horses then they would they just loved to strip and plunge into
 quarter the carcass and if the weight a lake or a stream for a good bath they was not too
 much would pack all of also always rinsed their mouths after the meat onto their horses but often each meal
 going outside the tepee to the kill was far too heavy for a horse do it considering the conditions in
 to pack both a man and the meat in which they lived i deem those customs that case they chose
 a piece of the best of theirs to be highly admired and meat to take into camp and then piled
 they were exceptionally hospitable even all the rest together and planted a stick with the whites who showed friendship over
 the meat and tied to it something for them with the smell of man a neckerchief or anything else to
 scare off coyotes lynx another custom much to be comor other meat eating animals this mended was always to share
 the sucworked for a night but if left too long cessful results of the individual hunter animals would make off
 with some of the with all the family groups in the same meat especially if a grizzly came along camp
 at the time in the evening when or a wolverine the devil of the wilder all were back in camp
 the successful ness the next day usually the women hunters cut up all the meat into as many would ride
 leading some pack horses pieces as there were families and after and get all the meat into camp laying aside
 the skin and a portion for his own family he distributed all the when i first went mountain sheep rest
 around so that no family suffered hunting with my indian brother on their hunger as long as any one hunter
 had big fall hunt as soon as we entered the been successful tepee i was startled to see paul take
 off all his clothes keeping on only his their family life as far as i could breach clout and lay
 on the blankets see was admirable in the many years it will rest you and you will feel fine i
 lived for fairly long periods each year to let the air on you he said and within their family circles
 i have never after that i noticed that this was an witnessed any corporal punishment established custom of the indians
 and handed out to any of their children i think that this is the right time for me they would
 be admonished briefly and to set aright some wrong notions ac never did they prolong a show of discepted by
 most white people about my pleasure when they married i am friends the indians that they were not referring now
 to their old customs of a cleanly people when i first knew over fifty years ago the man would give
 them and during the milder weather the mother of the wife to be one or more 18 horses the couple
 usually got along the middle of the northern winters to well but if they found that their per catch fur
 bearing animals with which to sonalities clashed they would decide to buy needed supplies for their families separate usually in
 quite a friendly and what about the crossing of rivers manner the wife taking with her the raging in full
 flood and the heavy work children if any the camp and almost connected every year with their fall everything else
 outside of the very per hunting trips in some cases hundred sonal belongings of the man such as of miles
 away when the trails were his horse or horses saddle rifle and obstructed by numerous fallen trees after so on
 the husband usually helped the wild winters storms some towards the upkeep of the children sure the women had to
 work to set who were always welcome by every up the lodges cut firewood dry the body amongst the indians
 meat and prepare meals and make moc many times i have had to listen to casins and gloves for all
 the family and harangues by white men who not being a certain amount of their artistic bead able to understand
 or speak the indians work kept them busy but what always language not having ever lived their clinched the argument
 was when i asked life amongst them could not possibly be them if any white woman did not work most
 of the day looking after the childin a position to hold forth about them and to give as their opinion
 that all ren getting meals and keeping clothes indians were lazy and that their women rooms furniture and in fact
 the whole did all the work while the men only household in good order and in many lolled about and
 smoked that s ab cases till late in the day while their solutely not so i always disagreed with lords
 and masters sat comfortably in an them and asked them if they thought easy chair reading smoking and look that
 hunting in wild mountain country ing at television sure the men worked as an absolute necessity towards having during part
 of the day to earn the living the means to keep themselves and their for the family but was not
 that what my families alive and not for sport was indian friends also did and in most cases still do
 a lazy way of living also carrying or dragging the kill to where horses could i hope that i have
 been able to give be led to pack all the meat to camp you a small insight into the real
 life or was it easy for the men to travel of my friends the original inhabitants for hundreds of miles
 on snowshoes in of north america trip to jasper h rosling who has a trading post on the athabasca at
 prairie creek a few miles this side of the jasper house had a somewhat trying experience this fall in getting
 up his trading supplies instead of packing all the way as usual he had his goods freighted out to the
 athabasca at the site of the old fort assiniboine by teams intending to take them up the athabasca to prairie
 creek by boat but the athab asca is very swift in this part of its course and the water very
 low making progress slow ice began to run in the river much earlier than usual and in the end the
 attempt had to be abandoned and resort had to the old system of pack horses in former days the h
 b co used to carry on trade with the mountains using the river route but horses were probably dearer and
 men cheaper proportionately than now edmonton bulletin nov 13 1899 19 dominion land surveys by carl lester on july 1

 many years culminated in the realization of the dream of the fathers of confederation a dominion of canada stretching from
 the atlantic to the pacific and from the united states border to the arctic by the terms of confederation the

 necessary to surveyors to report their presence in the resort to the production of the base lines field by a
 certain date and to allot the directly b etween the various initial me work of the missing ones among thcse

 of iron posts for the wooden posts hitherto used the posts in that mont during this season a land area
 country were mostly of poplar and those survey which in point of magnitude still were of no use whatever as
 the numbers stands unrivalled as far as is known disappeared from them in a few years in the history of
 land subdivision in so i asked that we be allowed to use iron posts well the minister did not believe
 in any country accurate surveying or any permanent surveying or anything like that he had a no the reason for
 the department plac lion of his own and would not listen about ing such a large number of parties in
 iron posts at all the wooden posts were good enough for him i tried to bring forth the field during
 the season was ox all the arguments i could for iron posts and plained by the surveyor general dr e
 among them i pointed out that in surveying deville in discussing the paper his the open prairies there was no
 wood there and we would have to carry our cumbersome tory of alb erta surveys by i n wal wooden
 posts with us i pointed out the lace d l s at a meeting of the associ convenience of the
 iron posts in comparation of dominion land surveyors in icon and the minister said to go ahead 1912 he said
 and use them but the surveyors would have to pay for them well we got the iron posts anyway and
 i don t think the it is a very good paper all through surveyors paid for thorn evidently mr wallace
 has given a good deal of attention to the subject and his criticisms are very good and to the point
 in the early part of 1883 it was he knows what he is talking about but found that the business
 of the departthere are some things which are not general mont of the interior had become so exly known and
 which he perhaps might not be expected to know for instance speak tensive that the offices of deputy mining of
 the hurry of those early surveys of ister and surveyor general which had 1883 in the past they were always
 wanted been combined in the person of lindsay in a rush and then when immigration russell were separated mr russell
 ceased or business came to a standstill the whole thing fell down but in 1883 what retained the supervision of
 the technical caused this big amount of subdivision work branch as surveyor general and a m to be done was
 the c p r they wanted burgess became deputy minister the to make the surveys themselves they wanted that task
 transferred to them in supervision of the surveys at headfact they wanted to get everything they quarters was under the
 control of e could and they thought that would be a deville d t s chief inspector of sumgood idea
 in addition to their land grant veys while w f king d t s inspector they thought it would be
 well to survey of surveys had the direction of field it themselves as they thought they might make something out
 of it they went to operations the minister and explained to him that it would be impossible for the department
 the large area which had been sumof the interior to survey such an amount of land as in their grant
 twenty million acres veyed and made available for settlement quite impossible by the operations in 1882 and 1883 was found
 to b e fully equal to the immediate there was only one way with them requirements and it was considered
 adin which it could be done as they wanted visable to curtail operations in the field their grant right away
 within the year and they said only the c p r could at experience had shown that the mounds tempt
 anything like that that argument and posts in unsettled districts were was put to me and i was told that
 we from various causes obliterated and in might have to resort to the company to the resurvey of the townmake
 our surveys well i induced our some cases minister then john a macdonald to try us ships had been found
 necessary anyway and to give us a chance as there was not much difficulty in surveying that in march 1885
