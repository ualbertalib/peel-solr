 brethren known as the hutterites first began and flourished in the deep and beautiful valleys of the tyrol today more
 than three hundred years later their descendants live in a hundred and fifty colonies scattered across the broad prairies of
 western canada they have maintained their values mores and traditions over the centuries in spite of persecution and forced migration

 have preserved their society with the fewest adaptations of all the anabaptist groups during the period of great political unrest
 and religious turmoil of the reformation the social mechanisms which evol culturation the organization of the ved to perpetuate their

 indian and white by a d fisher cultural conflict has long been thought of as the most important facet of
 white and indian relations on the prairie when we think of the wide rolling plains we think of feathered indians
 on pinto ponies well armed fur trappers or traders trade forts the north west mounted police red river carts indian
 wars and the like often it seems that without white indian skirmishes without the dashing pseudo military individuals of the
 west without the cunning and violent indian there would be no heroic historical sagas for us to treasure however when
 asked to look at cul things that anthropologists call cultural conflict on the prairies i see small tune thus in
 a general sense culture is groups of indians moving slowly on foot common to all mankind but the specific over
 the prairie in search of the buffalo type of culture of any particular group i think of the various melationships
 be is more or less restricted to that group of tween these earliest men of the prairies peopie for this
 reason theme is wide and their environment i can imagine variability between various types or the slow movements of various
 gmoups kinds of culture often inter cultural to and from the prairies and the many conflict comes about for just
 this reason complexities that made up their lives peoples having differing linguistic social and ideological patterns have dif were these
 events meaningless to the ficulty in relating their ways of living peoples of the prairies both indian and one to
 another european one hundred or more years ago did the conditions of the land and this being the case we
 shall look at its people influence the form conflict the cultures of the various groups of took between the cultures
 of white and human beings of the prairies to ascertain indian did the conditions that existed the nature of the
 cultural conflict and on the prairie influence what the trader to begin this we shall have to ask what trapper
 and mountie did when faced is it about prairie indian culture that with taming this great expanse of makes it
 unique among cultures land most certainly they did so it is from this perspective the long range the prairie provinces
 of canada sit the universal the evolutionary perspective that i look at cultural conflict on the astride the great open
 grassland prairiefoothill region of north america from prairie the peace river country to northern to begin to see the whole
 picture we mexico this vast open space divides the must start with some generalizations continent on a north south axis
 al first we must grant that when human though the core area the high plains beings live together they create
 linguis and tall grass prairies is easy to identitic social and ideological systems fy the region itself grades off into
 many around themselves to facilitate the busi different geographical sub areas the ness of living these systems taken in examples
 of this gradation are the their mutually supportive and interlock plains prairie division the prairie easting wholeness comprise that set

 pankland division and the parkland forest particularly in alberta saskatboneal forest division chewan and manitoba one finds the our concern
 with the core area and pankland prairie this is a region which the more marginal sub divisions focuses shares both
 sets of characteristics open en the significance of each region for prairie with sections of bush all of these the
 development of plains indian cul areas are associated with numerous ture the core area of the plains lies far slight
 variations in ecological relations to the south of us it covers the states between their human residents and the of
 nebraska and kansas and includes non human biological on geographical pants of south dakota minnesota iowa environments naturally this kind
 of missouri and colorado in this area variation also affects the nature of the culture carried by the humans many
 of the cultural influences from the margins of the plains came together to this ecologically determined variaform a distinctive kind

 the fringe of this photographed near calgary in 1901 23 along the eastern borders of the plains one of greatest
 importance to us was the from arkansas to minnesota and the one derived from the southeastern part dakotas from approximately

 the main into manitoba it like the other subportion of their subsistence base scat sistence patterns was restricted by tered
 among these farmer hunters were climatic and geographic considerations nomadic hunting groups dependent en and thus was none too successful
 in its tirely upon the great bison herds northern adaptations moving further north to the prairie so prior to the
 white man we had a pankland and boreal regions we find number of significant cultural changes another subsistence pattern settled
 yet occurring on the prairies from pleistowandering here it would appear that cene times we have had the gradual groups
 of people hunters primarily evolution of modern subsistence techniwould winter hunt in one area and sum ques big game nomadism
 semimen hunt in another the type of hunting sedentary hunting and collecting and and gathering practiced is probably mixed horticulture
 and hunting all of more properly called collecting these these adaptations took place in fairly people lived in small scattered
 bands specific physical environments a n d each one attached to a particular hunt among certain but less specific populaing
 on collecting area each one depen tions it would appear for example that dent upon that amea s resources some
 the semi sedentary hunters and collecof these small groups would come to tons were primarily of the algonkian gethen occasionally
 for communal hunt language family the horticultumalists ing fishing or gathering enterprises on the eastern plains appear to be pni
 and here too on the northern plains manly sioux or caddoan speakers there were nomads dependent upon the while the
 big game hunters were more on bison less a mixed bag algonkian knutenain salishan and uto aztecan speakers our concern

 this change ranged the length and breadth of the generally speaking there were three exarea amples of these types of

 europeans they were in search of saying it was contact with european both gold and souls next theme were civilization
 that caused these conditions french speaking europeans seeking the rather illogically we give our ancestors continent s fur bearing animals

 european intervention in north north and east each group had a dif 25 ferent view of what they wanted and
 a european trade goods or the routes of different idea of how to achieve their diffusion of these goods these
 effects aims are best seen in the north and northeast where excepting the ojibwa cree and initially three things happened
 new eastern sioux the result was to create goods and tools were introduced to the tribal society almost instantaneously aboriginal
 population in exchange for the produce of the continent or the souls for the ojibwa cree and to a degree
 of the people along with the tools new the assiniboine the introduction of limetechniques were introduced and un arms appears
 to have forestalled their known european diseases spread over entry into the tribal stage of evolution the land the result
 was an uproar their initial superiority in contrast to caused by aboriginal groups leaping groups farther to the west in
 what we from the band level to the tribal level of might call weapons systems made it social evolution in
 almost no time at all unnecessary for them to amalgamate in for many indians of the deciduous east to large
 tribal groups until a later date em forests this came simultaneously from 1650 on theme was a massive upwith european
 contact however for the heaval which sent indian bands tumblprairie plains it occurred as a secondary ing out from the
 woods and pankland result of this contact the eastern on to the open plains this movement indians many of them
 accustomed to was from northeast to southwest and hunting on the fringe of the plains acted when they reached the
