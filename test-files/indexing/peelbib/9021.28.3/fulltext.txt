 father la substantial though not showy it is lighted by the hired men to learn about the care of the

 much needed help he made a trip to st albert to commandeer a carload of potatoes from the bishop s
 garden andfrom lethbridge he returned with several carloads of coal from a friend s collieries lumber for the outbuildings came
 from nother source and he was able to persuade two railways to ship his precious gifts to him in the
 1920 s and 1930 s e f hoshka foreman of the bow valley ranch spent part of every fall driving
 two of the sisters all over southern alberta in his model t ford to beg money for the support of
 the home 24 they often arrived back with the ca r loaded with chickens eggs and vegetables the contributions of
 the farmers they had visited the sisters also owned about a quarter section west of the macleod trail which they
 used for pasture and hay patrick burns also allowed them to use about 50 to 60 acres of the bow
 valley ranchlands east of the home for grazing from about 1930 to 1960 there were two major sources of income
 for the operation of the home a farm at vulcan and the sandpits of the macinnes place in the first
 instance luke stack and william macdonald solicitors for the sisters of providence had become executors for the fraser farm in
 vulcan originally the 1 ½ father albert lacombe acetylene gas generated in the building and an excellent steam heating system
 has been installed upstairs are dormitories and offices and below he diningrooms and commissariat department following the ceremony tea coffee
 sandwiches and cakes were served and an impromptu collection yielded over 500 in addition some of the guests had brought
 with them donations of linens for the 90 bedrooms of the new home from the beginning the home was chronically
 short of funds patrick burns in whom the sisters had a staunch supporter supplied them with meat and butter and
 supplemented their milk supply he gave the home a small herd of daiy cattle and as cows became dr y
 or gave a reduced yield he replaced them from his own ranch stock there were chickens a few pigs and
 horses and one or two hired ha nds supervised the livestock care there was a large vegetable garden later known
 as father newman s garden 2 which helped to stock the root cellar with vegetables for the winter for father
 newman chaplain from 1923 to 1950 the ga rden was a hobby and a recreation the children at the home
 helped with the weeding planting and harvesting nd the older children accompanied sections were mainly devoted to the raising of
 horses and the operation was leased to a real character roy murphy 26 however in 1932 the frank shaw family
 rented the acreage and with the advance of mechanized farming they turned to mixed farming with one third of the
 crop share going to the sisters of providence between father newman s ga rden and the vulcan produce the home
 s root cellars were filled every year what remained of their one third interest he sisters obtained in cash in
 1942 43 frank shaw retired and the farm was taken over under the same conditions by his son leslie who
 ran it until 1959 for two years after it was operated by a man named van brunshot until the farm
 was finally sold in i 962 63 27 mea nwhile p burns ranches ltd owned the acreage south of the
 lacombe home which was known as the maclnnis place this became part of the land trade between p burns ranches
 and the sisters of providence in 1960 however prior to this in about 1955 the burns people allowed the sisters
 the revenue from a valuable handed over to the solicitors of the sisters this sand pit somewhere near the midnapore
 texaco acreage became part of a later land trade deal 36 in station on a contract basis this provided a

 hay the sisters and the home had many benefac in 1957 the sisters of providence agreed to tors as could
 be expected patrick burns transfer to p burns ranches ltd 222 acres remembered them substantially in his will he including
 the fish creek lands extending past the died in 1937 george hanlin a wealthy bache north bluff of the creek
 in return they were br and a non catholic had originally been the given the 251 acres south of 146

 the l 930 s and when he died in the of the original 1910 gift and said further early l

 decided not to released from any further observance of the said try to work the farm and it was sold
 almost condition the new land was given free of any immediately 8 in 1959 the sisters received stipulation as to
 usuage 38 the sisters did indeed notice of a surprise inheritance from a texan wish to be free of any
 obligations as a change in desborough hanson hanson apparently never government policy with respect to orphans i e forgot the

 he became ill on a visit to his opposed to institutional care 3 had phased out the brother in high
 river his unexpected gift operation of the orphanage at the home in became a new boys dormitory 3 addition in
 spite of extensive renovations the original gift of 200 acres from patrick through the years the home was deteriorating and
 was becoming unsuitable as a senior citizen s burns was not made without conditions father lacombe had asked the sisters
 of providenc to residence instead although basically a nursing manage the home for him but it is apparent that order
 the sisters had built in 1955 a school to burns wanted to ensure that the land was used for the
 south of the home with some of students the purpose of a home for orp hans and the aged as
 boarding at the home outlined by the priest therefore it was stipulated but by about 1955 the burns group was
 that the gift was given subject to the condition becoming increasingly concerned with the that it is to be held
 by the sisters so long as the southward march of the development of the city same is used for the
 purpose of a home for the of calgary they felt that the original purpose of aged people and orp hans
 and in default thereof is patrick burns did not include the encroachment to revert to the said late honorable patrick
 burns of commercial developers on the fish creek his heirs and assigns this clause reappeared lands 4 therefore perhaps feeling
 that the in the negotiations for the land transfer of 1957 sisters might be forced to yield to this kind
 of 60 commercial pressure they wanted the return of in the meantime the constant need for more the fish creek
 acreage the sisters relieved of land particularly for hay and pasture even for any obligation as to the use of
 the land accepted the small farming operation conducted by the the trade of the 222 acres to the north of
 the home home led to a request by the sisters in 1945 for an for the 251 acres in the
 south including the title additional 100 acres adjoining the north boundary to the gravel pit which was still in operation
 of the existing land burns ranches at that time also excepted from the deal was the area of the was
 being managed by patrick burn s nephew sewage disposal for the home pending the dev john burns it is evident
 that he did not want to ebopment of a midnapore sewage system it may part with any further land but
 ‘‘ owing to the also be that at least a part of father newman s interest taken in the welfare
 of the lacombe garden extended into the fish creek acreage home by the late senator burns 4 he consented and
 was therefore left intact 4 to the sale of the 100 acres for 60 per acre in in 1972 the
 southern 251 acres were transfer may of 1946 the initial payment of 3 000 was red to keith construction co

 farmer driving a smart that he had returned this was his first experience horse and buggy met him on the
 road right with an indian demonstration and he found it not there sam hailed the man and tried to make
 a only noisy but terrifying locating an empty tent deal for the conveyance the farmer no doubt he pulled a
 blanket overhis head and tried to rest unsettled by the sight of ready cash sold the and when an indian
 woman came and spoke to horse and buggy without too much dickering him he only grunted in reply thinking she

 they joined forces and between them accepted at this time she had no thought of bought a considerable amount and

 north into the trap sam without proposing gave vera a solitare ping area he hired a car and driver costing
 him diamond ring but she did not consider herself 25 per day to ta ke him to the various settleengaged
 she actually thought that sam did not ments on this trip he purchased 5 000 muskrat realize the meaning of
 a diamond ring pelts for 1 00 each in one month alone buying for an anglican to marry into the
 muslim 1 050 skins faith was hardly considered however afterthey on april 15 1923 vera gave birth to a redhad

 the registry as they could not find roy he grew up to become head of the workers a minister who
 would perform the ceremony as compensation board in edmonton on june 25 yet those of the muslim faith had neither
 a 1925 vera bore another son this one named mosque nor a minister robert who brought his parents happiness the
 when they were married sam had about 200 jamhas had to wait nine years for their first girl cash in
 hand as they got down to their last 40 but on may 13 1934 madam was born sam he explained
 that he would have to go away to spoiled her yet his love and abundant gifts given earn more money
 it was difficult this first were tempered with qualifying discipline when separation but he divided his money s 20 for
 the children reached school age a muslim ac could have sold them the building as well as it was the
 store building was eventually sold to the catholic mission many fur companies were now going broke so sam began to
 speculate with his own money he started shipping furs to montreal at one time he shipped 50 000 worth to
 fred swartz at edmonton fur auction sales to make a long story short some good sales were made but there
 were many losses and in the winter of 1928 he went broke from then until 1931 he was without steady
 employment by then the dark days of depression had commenced sam though not working still had some deals to help
 him over first stages of the crunch his greatest hope was that a supply of p rime muskrat pelts that
 were being held in storage would bring a good price if he held out long enough at one time he
 had been offered 16 500 for the lot but he was forced eventually to sell the first grade skins for
 a meager 165 his pride was terribly hurt when he was forced to go on relief in desperation he even
 begged the relief officials to take him from the records and instead loan him 700 so he could start a
 new business venture this of course they were unable to do in 1939 circumstances finally improved for sam he started
 work again on a 50 50 basis with edmonton fur auction sales owned by fred swartz and sol levine on
 his first deal from st paul he purchased 5 00 muskrats for 1 00 each and when they sold for
 52 65 sam ended up making 35 per pelt he then decided to go into business for himself and advertised
 that he was abuyer of raw furs hides horse hair seneca root and wool by this time sam owned a
 home at 11825 80 th st previously he had owned a smaller home on 95 th street whtch he purchased
 for 56 000 the new home was only 1 900 more and sam felt it could not he turned down
 with business improving they lived at that address for the next 35 years in the 1920 s a handful of
 muslims conceived from their spiritual needs of a place to meet regularly and to worship at first they proposed a
 community hall but eventually the majority held out for a mosque to he constructed to muslim specifications and to the
 glory of allah because of the depression money was too scarce to allow the dream 10 conic true immediately hut
 they did sam lamha with his first horn son roy quaintance was hired to instruct them in the arabic language
 and muslim faith in 1927 sam bought a store in wahasca it was stocked with canned goods and flour he
 took his brother in law robert jowett with him to manage the place during his frequent absence while fur buying
 or visiting edmonton sam taught bob to buy furs but did not feel he was particularly cut out for this
 type of work bob only stayed with sam for one year and then decided to return to civilization as he
 did not enjoy the rugged life at this point sam decided it might he a good idea to return to
 edmonton with bob and be with his family full time they employed three men and all worked like hell for
 three days time to take in 1 800 at the closing out sale sam promised to sell the remainder of
 the merchandise to the hudson s bay co at half price this would bring in a further 52 60 the
 merchandise for sale consisted of dry goods canned stuff and flour the deal was made because the bay was out
 of flour and sam had 2 9 x sacks he promised to sell them the flour if they would buy
 the remainder of his goods he adtiiitted later that he was dumb hecause they needed flour so badly lie a

 feet was built for often daily to talk over their plans sam one of 5 000 a large sum of
 money during the lean the leaders of this group felt deeply about his years much of the construction was done
 by religion and did not want tradition of years to their own hands without pay but it was joyous disintegrate

 life and the venture after a time it was decided that there death he departed this world in dignity and
 wasn t enough work for two men so sam sold out serenity a tall tale now it is a well
 known fact that there is a strip of land running south from medicine hat down across the international boundary into
 montana which is plentifully supplied with rattlesnakes and naturally there are more or less rattlesnake stories told and according to
 the story tellers one is led to believe that whiskey is the only antidote for rattlesnake bites be that as
 it may here is the story as told to me by one of the veterans of the north west mounted
 police it was shortly after the canadian pacific railway company had laid its bands of steel across the prairie that
 a coal mine was opened up by a large mining concern across the saskatchewan river and a few miles up
 the railroad from medicine hat the concern employing a large number of men among them being one ben buller who
 was the genial good natured soul of the mining camp poor ben had his faults however and directly he would
 receive his monthly pay he would leave camp and strike for medicine hat and get filled up on all the
 bad whiskey he could lay his hands on in these ea rly days there was prohibition in the territories and
 any whiskey which came in had to be smuggled and sold in speak easies but ben was on to the
 ropes and generally managed to get what he wanted one fine morning in june ben blew into town with his
 month s pay in his pocket and a light heart but before night had got his usual load of bad
 whiskey when he started for camp he crossed the river on the canadian pacific railway bridge but he did not
 get far before he had to lie down to sleep off some of the effects of his potations he lay
 there all night and next morning a couple of medicine hat citizens taking a walk along the railway track came
 upon him they at once shook him up and placed him on his feet nd were horrified to see lying
 right beside him where he had been a large rattlesnake they at once made for some stones with which to
 kill the reptile but on closer exa mination it was found that the snake was already dead they hen examined
 ben and were startled to find several rattlesnake bites on different parts of his body but he appea red to
 be none the worse for the bites and never experienced any trouble from them after it was generally supposed that
 ben was so saturated with whiskey that the reptile s poisonous fangs had no effect on him and hat the
 whiskey had caused the death of the rattler calgary herald july 27 1906 75 years ago a picture feature when

 to purchase a and it was going to be quite a struggle lot on parkhill and he with the help
 of his brother dad finally wrote mom a long letter he had and friend george built a three roomed house
 fallen in love with calgary even though it was this house had a large combined kitchen and livbitterly cold the
 beautiful view of the canadian ing room with two bedrooms leading off it rockies west of calgary helped him to
 forget the we discovered that the other four houses on the weather he had been told that this was the
 most hill were families who had also come from yorksevere winter alberta had experienced since the shire and so we
 had the beginning of a ver y terrible one in 1886 he told her of seeing cattle friendly neighborhood it

 journey by boat i sunday service on alternate sundays in each other s homes it turned out that two homes
 had organs so the services were held alternately at the harris s and the jones s the men also got
 together and built forms for a sunday school which was held in the harris s home they had been fortunate
 in obtaining the services of a young minister alfred mosely who had been a substitute minister at trinity methodist church
 in east calgar y he had called on mom when we had first arrived in calgary at that time we
 were still in what mom called the cowshed and she was embarrassed to receive a minister in such poor surroundings
 he stepped into the house and stood talking with her when she suddenly remembered her manners and said well you
 may as well sit down while you standing i don t quite know how i can do that mrs norman
 but i will be glad to sit down and talk with you then she suddenly thought of what she had
 said and they both laughed but it was to be a common saying of hers in the years to come
 sit down while you re standing wesley methodist church heard of our services being held in private homes and offered
 to finance the building of a church so all the men on the hill gave of their time and built
 the stanley park methodist church mr mosely became our first minister and at the first service in the new church
 he held communion passing the tiny glasses of wine and broken bread to each member when he came to mom
 and me he lifted out the will norman family in calgary in december 1906 consisted of will his wife grace
 and daughters muriel the author on her mother s lap and phyllis kitchen it was a large room and had
 a cupboard for dishes and also a pantry and a cellar head leading to the cellar during this time mom
 mrs hollings and her sister had been going to central methodist church to hear rev george kerby they loved this
 man but as his services were often lengthy they usually sat at the back if he knew of a family
 in distress especially a family disappointed in canada who wanted to return to their homeland he would tell his congregation
 he was going to pass the collection plate around until he had sufficient money to assist them then mom and
 her friends would sometimes slip out as they had a the tiny glass and was about to hand it to
 me but mom shook her head no he whispered let her take this it will be something she will never
 forget and while i had just turned six years old at that time communion service always brings his words back
 to me that morning we were also proud to have our first organ recently arrived from eaton s of winnipeg
 in the years that followed we had many visits to our church from the rev dr kerby and also from
 william aberhart who beca me alberta s social credit premier in 1935 when i was still a little girl we
 held a sunday school rally and the speaker was none other than the rev john mc dougall who seemed to
 me to be a little man but he told us many tales of his early days in the west among
 the indians that was a never tobe forgotten sunday and our tiny little church received that great little man with
 awe when i was six there was no school nearby for long walk home up the mission road in the
 dark there being no street cars at that time one evening however the reverend gentleman mentioned that there were three
 ladies who always sat at the back of the church and he would very much like to meet them if
 they would remain after the service mom was thrilled and never forgot the welcome handshake they each received from that
 wonderful man by this time there were a few more houses on the hill so the women decided they could
 hold a me to attend so mom and dad decided that i winter weather the hollings fa mily hadn t

 and there for the adoption by the commission of james garden s having when he had finished the thunderous proposal
 for a new civic centre in june 1912 sustained applause was evidence that his words provides an example in point

 as well as ceived the mawson success package wrapped tn to his considerable powers of personal persuap lausible ideas and

 little idea of what it wanted in this clearly the mawson lecture ofoctober 4 had a respect the commission was
 more a manifestaprofound effect on the thinking of the planning tion of a movement towards general reform than commission events
 moved purposefully and ra it was a specific response to a perceived need pidly from that date almost as if
 in response to because it was uncertain as to direction the mawson s rousing appeal for calgarians to act commission
 did not attempt to formulate even decisively on oct 12 the planning commis rudimentary planning policies for council to sion

 in obtaining copies of expert as possessing equal qualifications to the new brunswick town planning act which investigate and report
 on matters relative to town incidentally was applied almost in its entirety to planning 7 the report went on to
 state that the alberta so it was with mawson town planning city should have a well known man as this
 in was a vaguely understood concept that worked itself would be of great value to us from a publi for
 the common good if implemented properly city standpoint given mawson s interna the planning commission knew little about tional reputation
 there was little doubt that the experts or their qualifications nevertheless it commission had settled on him as its expert
 had advertised widely 76 and ostensibly was faced the second part of the report requested a sum of with the
 problem of choosing one from many at least 10 000 to cover the expenses in connec the sudden appearance of
 the well known agtion with the employment of an expert and the gressive mawson obviated this need no one preparation

 on oct 18 the were practical or feasible for calgary no one commission sent away for copies of the new

 back in calgar y preparing the public for the report indeed it where he met with the commissioners while the
 appears that the planning commission was more specific details of this meeting are not available cognizant of the report s
 contents than that it is known that aspects of the report were discusenvinced when it was made public in 1914

 develop with the main arterial roads and bridges more importantly from the point of clearly indicated i would also suggest
 an improved view of implementation mawson believed strongly in the totality and immediacy of his plan as such he was
 ada mant that his proposals be neither changed nor delayed public reaction to the report though mixed was basically favourable
 the albertan was impressed by the report s enormity and scope it compred mawson plans for a city hall as
 resembling st peter s the kremlin the house of parliament nd the pnma pacific exposition rolled into one 4 after
 terming the whole concept as mawson plan for the calgar y of 2014 ‘ the sa me journal went on
 to say that if followed calgary would be the most beautiful inland city in all canada to the rev george
 kerby principal of mount royal college the plan represented one of the best investments the city had ever made 43
 however the response from city hall was more guarded aldermen d w crichton and i ruttle expressed concern over the
 cost of implementing the plan which according to commissioner arthur graves would require a bond issue of between 8 million
 and 10 million 45 graves also maintained that the current high price of land placed severe limitations on the city
 s ability to implement the report 46 another official city engineer g w craig described the plans as ideal but
 strongly doubted whether they could ever be implemented yet probably the most revealing comments came from james h garden the
 original impetus behind calgary s entr y into town plan one of mawson s sketches envisioned a massive structure on
 the banks of the bow river play the lack of reference was more conspicuous in light of the fact that
 mawson himself sent a telegram to the convention apologizing for his absence 52 then in october 1914 the calgary town
 planning commission resigned en masse on the grounds that it had completed the work for which it was created the
 truth of the matter was that town planning particularly the concept advocated by mawson was a dead issue in calgary
 the city s two year flirtation with the grand design was over by 1914 the city of calgary was in
 no position fling and now president of the planning commission although he referred to the plans as a work of
 art garden was also of the opinion that it would be years before they could be implemented 47 his accompanying
 remark that it is well to have the plan for when the time comes we can take advantage of it
 46 was a concise summation of official attitude and in retrospect represented city hall s epithet to mawson s grand
 design for calgar y in the next six months mawson s report slipped into obscurity and in subsequent years emerged
 only occasionally in the city clerk s correspondence as a response to requests for copies from far flung libraries and
 cities 4 it to finance its current projects let alone anything as costly as mawson s as early as 1912
 there were signs that municipal spending had reached dangerous limits in that year interest payments on debentures plus the city
 s short term borrowing from banks totalled 2 5 million the city s ability to meet these commitments was ser
 iously questioned by treasurer thomas burns who made several strong pleas for retrenchment 5 that they fell on deaf ears
 was reflected in his bitter note to the financial committee of council in november 1912 1 have asked repeatedly to
 have work shut down but of no avail and i do not intend worrying any more over the matter 56
 beginning in 1913 the seems fairly certain that city officials took the easiest way out and allowed the report to
 die while paying lip service to its utility as a guide to future development 5 no mention was made of
 mawson s work in the proceedings of the second alberta town planning and housing convention held in calgar y june
 16 18 1914 even though the plans themselves were on dis city s inability to collect its annual taxes brought
 the commission during 1913 and 1914 had inhome the treasurer s point in a way all his volved itself in
 practical matters through its warnings could not calgar y began 1914 with standing sub committees the planning corntaxes outstanding of
 about haifa million dollars mission recommended to council on matters and in that year expenditure at 3 2 million was
 relative to streets and boulevards housing and fully 1 1 million more than revenue 58 small sanitation playgrounds parks traffic
 and wonder that the 1914 council dominated as it transportation as well as placement of buildings was by brokers and
 financial agents 5 was not when mawson finally produced his report the overly enthusiastic towards mawson s expen commission was
 far more seasoned in the practisive proposals calities of municipal management than it was in 1912 when it was captivated
 by his splendid while many of mawson s proposals were dreams relevant and consistent with immediate needs he was in
 point of fact outside the mainstream of the mawson experience in calgary exemplicontemporary thought in town planning maw fled the

 was however no more than a cated had gained more popularity in the 19 th vaguely held perception calgary city
 councils century there was an aesthetic totality in had hardly developed to the stage where they mawson s blending of
 beautiful buildings with could move purposefully in new directions controlled open spaces uppermost in his mind institutionally local government had
 changed was a harmony of form which if followed faith little since frontier days fully by planners would result necessarily
 in a despite the widening municipal franchise better physical and social environment even local government remained the preserve of the
 before 1914 this idealist approach to planning business community whose members dominated was giving way to a more functional utilitarian
 councils in 1912 14 as much as they did in the philosophy planners increasingly were becom l 880 s or
 l 890 s most were short on political ing interested in factors of economy and effi experience and indeed it
 could be agrued that the ciency to produce the most optimum conditions level of political expertise on council was falling
 for the greatest number one manifestation of rather than rising by 1914 the councils at the this changing attitude was
 the focus on housing turn of the century for example were comprised and sanitation it is illustrative that alberta s
 of businessmen with far more experience in 1914 planning convention was entitled the municipal affairs than those of 1912 14
 as second alberta town planning and housing such the overall approach to civic management association convention at this convention had
 not changed markedly economic matters three of the six conferences were devoted still held top priority with social and long
 range entirely to housing and only one segment of one needs far behind city councils existed to conference dealt with
 a mawson like topic the provide a favourable business climate assuming keynote speaker at the second conference was the burden
 of corporate responsibility only when james h garden president of the calgary it was absolutely necessary though there were town
 planning commission his topic some new pressures and even some observable housing problems in the province of modifications of this
 attitude the businessmen s alberta view of local government was very much alive costs and applicability not withstanding and well
 in 1914 in this light the mawson experthere were other contributing factors in the plan tence was more a temporar
 y aberration than it ning commission s disenchantment with maw was a change of direction son s report mention has
 been made of the calgary city councils were accustomed to communication between mawson and the corn doing things on their
 own and rarely had had mission respecting publication of the report access to expert advise from within since mawson s
 insistence on additional funds to have incorporation in 1884 and up to l 909 civic the report published in britain
 did not sit well business had been executed basically by standwith the commission whose original intention ing committees of council
 these committees was to have the work done in calgary also had to rely heavily for advice on correspond ence
 or on the recommendations of their perm however that there were enough submissions anent employees whose qualifications and after 1914
 consistent with mawson s recommenability were often mistrusted although a corn dations to indicate that though the man and his
 mission form of government was in existence report were forgotten at least some of his ideas after 1909 it did
 not alleviate the problem of were not resident expertise since the commissioners the mawson report represented the ideal vithemselves were
 elected this absence of sion of a far sighted individual for a young city capable permanent officials in local government
 which had only vague perceptions of what it reflected a stage of institutional development needed and none of what it
 wanted it was un as an institution local government had yet to fortunate that the meritorious aspects of mawmodify its
 political bias structurally it had not son s work were lost in the awesome magnitide provided adequately for the tempering
 element of his baroque grand design he might have been of specialized knowledge bodies like the plan better remembered otherwise

 were fitting for this oft styled king of institutionalizing itself more politically so the town planners certainly in calgary s
 case readiness with which calgary s municipal modern planners looking back ruefully on opbodies turned to mawson the expert becomes
 portunities lost might be excused for thinking more understandable in fact it would have been that the king was right
