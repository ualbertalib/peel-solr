 iv the patrician message from the colonel in chief the year 1989 was a wonderful one for our regiment which 
 marked the 75th anniversary of its founding with celebrations 0:celebra 0:tions all over the country and indeed wherever patricias were 
 to be found in large or small numbers there was also a celebration in ypres and of course the u 
 k association had a large gathering at hatch court in somerset our founder s home in england we have all 
 thereby paid tribute to our great past and the debt we owe the gallant originals and early patricias of the 
 great war and those who took part in the second war and korea and other operation duties it has been 
 so good to realize that the high standards and great traditions of our regiment remain as good as ever and 
 that our aim is to pass them on in the same manner to our successors i was so very happy 
 to be able to take part with my husband in the culminating marvellous week of celebrations in calgary 0:cal 0:gary 
 which were so very impressive and enjoyable the mixture of formal and informal occasions showed all sides of our regimental 
 life and i felt so very proud to be a part of it one of the most striking features was 
 the tremendous support given by our veterans including seven originals which added greatly to the importance of the occasion i 
 am sure none of us will ever forget the sight of 1400 old guard joining in the march past after 
 that most wonderful regimental trooping nor will we ever forget the obvious enjoyment the young and old soldiers felt in 
 being able to meet and talk over their experiences together 1 felt we were all taking a part in the 
 expression and making of our fine regimental history and could look forward with great confidence to its continuing in the 
 future 
 v the patrician message from the colonel of the regiment the regiment may well look back with much satisfaction to 
 our 75th anniversary year a significant anniversary indeed we were able to welcome patricias whose service began with that of 
 the regiment to the youngest recruit who had just joined what a tribute what a march past our past history 
 is a solid foundation which shall guide all who serve in the future and there could be no greater pattern 
 to follow i shall not dwell upon the important events 0 the year which are illustrated quite well elsewhere in 
 this anniversary edition 0:edi 0:tion our 75th anniversary is over and we enter a new era today we are proud 
 to have a patricia as cds and we are equally 0:equal 0:ly proud to say that the regiment is in 
 excellent shape the units are tasked with challenging and interesting commitments from norway to cyprus from iran iraq to central 
 america patricias are serving with distinction and pride those of us at home value their service to our country and 
 hope that their tour of duty however long it may be will remain free of mishaps 0:mis 0:haps this 1990 
 is my final year as your colonel of the regiment i am proud indeed to have had the singular opportunity 
 to serve the regiment in this capacity as my generation of patricias is on its way out a generation of 
 soldiers who managed affairs 0:af 0:fairs of soldiers within set rules and discipline the next generation will be confronted with 
 new problems a rapid spread of education and democratic functions of our way of life have thrown up an entirely 
 new crop of patricias in its ranks the demand 0:de 0:mand on future leadership will grow manifold and command of 
 soldiers will involve new challenges the regiment is indeed ready to meet these challenges my wife betty joins me in 
 wishing you all the best in your future endeavors r s graham colonel of the regiment 
 vi the patrician message from the national president princess patricia s canadian light infantry association this past year our 75th 
 anniversary was a significant milestone in our regimental history the national reunion was a magnificent event for all patricias those 
 still serving and those of us who are retired the organization and execution of 75th year celebrations were a credit 
 to our regiment and indeed our association while many contributed to the success of this celebration we must recognize the 
 special place rod middleton occupied in energetically but patiently steering the association 0:as 0:sociation through the long planning period and 
 the implementation of the 75th anniversary plan we must also thank the association 0:as 0:sociation volunteers who worked faithfully and 
 hard to make this past year of celebration a success the year 1989 also marks the 42nd anniversary of the 
 founding of our association i am sure its responsibilities have grown well beyond that envisioned by our founder hamilton gault 
 in 1947 however he would be pleased with the way his association and regiment have grown perhaps during the 75th 
 celebrations it has become more apparent that the fabric of our regimental family consists of two entities the regiment the 
 serving members regimentally and extra regimentally employed 0:em 0:ployed and the corporate body made up of the association with its 
 members the association which is an independent component within the regimental family serves both the regiment and its retired members 
 it provides the legal and corporate 0:corpor 0:ate structure which holds and accounts for certain regimental property and funds therefore 
 much of our activity and administration 0:admi 0:nistration is linked with the regimental executive level this combined activity imposes special 
 care as regimental stewards in carrying out our responsibilities it also imposes an exacting responsibility to comply fully with the 
 association by laws and regulations issued by the department of consumer and corporate affairs during 1989 our association took an 
 active part in the creation of the calgary military museum and the ppcli hall of honour therefore we look forward 
 with pride and anticipation to the opening of the hall of honour and the museum of the regiments in 1990

 your efforts helped turn the tide towards freedom ottawa 1989 
 the patrician 12 first battalion the national reunion by major s m sawyer those who were in calgary during our 
 national reunion in celebration of the first 75 years of the regiment s service were treated to an outstanding presentation 
 that lasted three and one half days the hectic pace during the reunion was a result of five years planning 
 and one and one half years of dedicated labour by the serving and retired members of the regimental 0:reg 0:imental 
 family before i describe the reunion i want to thank those whose efforts were significant rod middleton and the members 
 of the calgary branch of the association gave yeoman service in the fields of publicity accommodation for out of town 
 guests establishment of report centers ethnic food kiosks at the better ole and raising funds in support of the ppcli 
 museum the 75th office staff for fielding all the questions organizing invitations and responses advertising protocol and administration the soldiers 
 of all three battalions and 2 airborne commando whose contributions ranged from parade square activities demonstrations and drill to building 
 props painting assembling and decoration of the better ole and servicing all the bars the significant contribution of the ppcli 
 band the peninsula band of the royal green jackets the city of edmonton police pipe band the city of calgary 
 police pipe band and the corps of drums from all three battalions cannot be overlooked to all who contributed 1 
 extend my sincere thanks and the appreciation of all our guests during our reunion the reunion began on 10 august 
 1989 that day was scheduled to be the main reception day we were besieged by more than 3000 members of 
 the regimental family who found their way to the official opening of the better ole by the colonel 0:col 0:onel 
 of the regiment old acquaintances were renewed and pat blue was consumed and we were off to the races the 
 colonel 0:col 0:onel in chief attended the better ole at 1900 hours and welcomed everyone to the national reunion friday 
 11 august 1989 was the first day of planned activities about one third of the reunion participants in addition to 
 many dignitaries from the calgary area attended a dedication ceremony at the site of the new museum a short but 
 stirring ceremony included prayers of dedication a description of the project a dedication by our colonel in chief and a 
 solo performed 0:per 0:formed by john milburn after the dedication we were treated to a luncheon on the site of 
 the museum grounds hard hat tours of the facility were also conducted the crowd moved to the currie parade square 
 and was joined by another 4000 spectators to witness the demonstration portraying the story of the regiment from its founding 
 to today s soldier while some drifted back to the better ole about 1400 went downtown that friday night to 
 the calgary convention centre 0:cen 0:tre the ppcli association had the evening to host the colonel in chief the colonel 
 of the regiment senior members of the regiment retired members and selected serving members of the regiment rod middleton hired 
 experienced professionals for his production staff and through bands choirs and actors gave a musical presentation of our regiment s 
 history to be sure it was a late night fortunately the next event wasn t scheduled until 1130 hours on 
 saturday 12 august 1989 then everyone gathered on the sports field for lunch before the trooping after lunch we moved 
 to the parade square where the bleachers were filled to capacity with 8100 spectators to watch the most unique and 
 spectacular trooping in our regiment s history the escort to the colours was provided by 1 ppcli guards 2 and 
 3 by 2 ppcli guard 4 by 2 airborne commando and guards 5 and 6 by 3 ppcli the colours 
 of all four units were on parade and marched with the guards from their units the ceremony included band performances 
 by the ppcli band the peninsula band of the royal green jackets the city of edmonton police pipe band the 
 city of calgary police pipe band and the corps of drums of all three patricia battalions 0:bat 0:talions surely the 
 most memorable sight was the march past of the old guard numbering more than 1400 all ranks that night there 
 was a dance in three huge tents erected on the sports field each tent housed 950 people they were filled 
 to capacity for supper and remained full for the dance afterwards in each tent there was a different style of 
 music the good brothers performed for the country and western fans mart kenney and his orchestra performed for those who 
 preferred 0:pre 0:ferred big band music while two local rock bands played for those who preferred a more youthful flavour 
 amazingly the three styles of music were deadened by the walls of the tents and thus did not compete or 
 blend with each other it was a great night on sunday 13 august 200 people took advantage of the bus 
 tours some went to the olympic sites while the more adventurous 0:ad 0:venturous went to banff and lake louise those 
 who took advantage of this offer were bussed back to calgary in time for the finale the last night began 
 with a western barbecue on the sports field once the barbecue was over 6000 people occupied the bleachers on the 
 parade square to view the sunset ceremony and feu de joi followed by fireworks the reunion in celebration of the 
 first 75 years as now over and all that remained was to get everyone home and to tear down lastly 
 i must mention the unsung supporters of our reunion without the support of soldiers from base calgary the reunion 0:reu 
 0:nion could not have taken place to all of you may 1 extend the sincere thanks of all ranks of 
 princess patricia s canadian light infantry

 the patrician 15 alpha company officer cadet t d sapera 1 989 was a good year for a company the 
 year began with exercise rapier thrust a ten day dismounted exercise where new commanders and old proved their leadership skills 
 often to the amusement of the young soldiers spring came and went with another course cycle and by april physical 
 training and section training became intense as a company prepared for the last summer exercise of the decade exercise rvb9 
 on the ground in wainwright training started with section commanders taking their men and reviewing basic drills the platoon commanders 
 then took over and began to mold the three sections into one cohesive fighting unit concentrating 0:concentrat 0:ing on mounted 
 and dismounted operations once this was done to the satisfaction of the many command elements the company commander took over 
 and applied his wisdom and developed three very different platoons with three very different 0:differ 0:ent platoon commanders into one 
 sub unit upon return to calgary a company was robbed in the slave trade by combat support and our weary 
 and aged platoon warrants had to reorganize our depleted platoons for exercise ortona trooper in fort lewis washington ortona trooper 
 was one of the better exercises that many of us had ever participated in as we got to go somewhere 
 new and somewhat different for many it was our first experience with house clearing especially our clerk and the experience 
 gained in training at a base capable of housing the entire canadian forces will remain with us for a long 
 long time upon returning home and unpacking all our newly acquired american gear a company joined the battalion in the 
 frantic 0:fran 0:tic preparations for the regiment s 75th anniversary soldiers were tasked out all over the base in tasks 
 too many to mention 0:men 0:tion for days on end but as the visiting dignitaries and retired patricias began to 
 arrive we all knew it was worth it there was an air of excitement in 1 ppcli as host of 
 the 75th reunion and all soldiers involved could feel it happily the celebrations 0:celebra 0:tions were a success many renewed 
 old acquaintances while young soldiers listened to old stories summer leave came and went too fast for most of us 
 and with the return to work there were some new faces around the company captain mai johnston took over as 
 the company second in command while newly promoted mwo gary foucault 0:fou 0:cault became the new csm ocdt sapera took 
 over 1 platoon and lt cliff trollope became 3 platoon commander and wo roy comeau escaped sigs platoon and became 
 the a company quartermaster major grant mcnally oc a company had pleasure turn quickly to pain as he came to 
 realize that all of his new commanders are either playing for or managing the battalion ice hockey team so much 
 for company physical training 17 september to 5 october found a company in dundurn saskatchewan for the battalion battle school 
 where pte dutton 0:dut 0:ton and pte kearney of 1 platoon were 1 ppcli s best at pairs fire and 
 movement scoring 73 out of 75 some of the other training received by the officers and men of a company

 while ocdt sapera and wo warrington leading 1 platoon came second the last three weeks of october found the company 
 busily preparing for the annual technical inspection prior to the fall course cycle 1 platoon managed to take a week 
 and head for the mountains for some rappelling top roping and mountain walks where mcpl thumper davis quickly learned the 
 importance of a brake man while rappelling when does the cast come off thumper lt gill and sgt kenny were 
 sent to the battle school to instruct on a tq3 course while lt trollope headed to borden for the intelligence 
 course and mention goes to pte godollei who could not out run the dogs while on the recce course the 
 fall course cycle took place in november and once again the company was depleted of troops giving the senior ncos 
 the chance to test their manhood and kill bambi during hunting season the year ended as it should have with

 to produce an article for the patrician that was clean light and gossipy concerning the company activities over the last 
 twelve months i found myself understanding for the first time why a company needs a 2ic someone has to do 
 the dirty work the inescapable conclusion in the introduction is that any check list of exercises and endless repetition of 
 personalities will undoubtedly be boring here it goes anyway it has been as busy a year for b coy as 
 ever with a couple of notable exceptions first our trip to spence bay n wt in late february and second 
 the 75th anniversary celebrations which were unique the first of these spence bay was for many of us our first 
 visit to the arctic and much fun was had by all it followed an interesting battalion winter exercise at wainwright 
 characterized by the successful running battle against the recce platoon and by the incongruous battalion soviet style night attack on 
 the abattoir as we slipped into spring exercise mad dog tested our mechanized drills on a short company live fire 
 exercise at suffield exercise rvb9 will be remembered mainly for its duration the sight of military police chasing individuals off 
 the tent roof at the ppcli band concert mcpl paquette giving a film crew an extremely hard time and the 
 divisional defensive exercise when b coy saw more action in its coy 0 p than the rest of the division 
 put together b company like everyone else was extensively involved in preparation for the 75th anniversary national reunion celebrations 0:cele 
 0:brations individual and collective responsibilities included construction of the better ole the erection of the large tents on rifles field 
 the provision of soldiers for the trooping of the colours the separate guard formed for the sunset ceremony and other 
 tasks too many to mention after summer leave the company went to dundurn saskatchewan with the rest of the battalion 
 on ex noble patricia everyone enjoyed the chance to get back to basics 4 platoon won the military skills competition 
 over the year we have said goodbye to a number of individuals and hello to their replacements one could go 
 on and on suffice it to say that the character of the company has remained unchanged and we look forward 
 to the exercises 0:exer 0:cises in chilcotin and norway in 1990 spence bay at twilight or was it noon hour

 are many new faces in the company and we can certainly say charlie company is under new management with a 
 new company commander second in command and sergeant major 0:ser 0:geant 0:major the 1988 89 training year started with mountain 
 school in the kananaskis country at the end of august the company went through a progressive training schedule of mountain 
 walking mountain climbing descending scree runs bridging rappelling and mountain rescue with attention being given to personal skills the company 
 participated in the battalion s 18 day battle school at the beginning of october training progressed from personal section to 
 platoon level live fire ranges the ranges included clearing 0:clear 0:ing a tunnel with pistol and flashlight close quarter combat 
 range pairs fire and movement clearing a booby trapped line section tank stalk section quick attack and a platoon assault 
 on a soviet bunker trench system the two highlights were the platoon patrol competition and the platoon march and shoot 
 competition which 7 platoon won in the autumn course cycle charlie company was responsible for the avgp course the first 
 two weeks of december 1988 saw the company do winter indoc in the sarcee training area the guys went over 
 tent routines winter route marches snowshoeing and the art of skiing on bangy boards after christmas we came out of 
 hibernation for ex nordic warrior in wainwright among other things the company conducted airfield security and each platoon went on 
 a night live fire ambush patrol for winning the platoon march and shoot competition in dundurn the previous fall 7 
 platoon went with the 3rd battalion 0:bat 0:talion to california to participate in ex caltrop 89 this was an abca 
 exercise which stands for american british canadian 0:cana 0:dian and australian the training included defensive operations for the canadians and 
 military operations in urban terrain mout throughout the exercise everyone was outfitted with miles equipment this proved to be quite 
 realistic as long as the americans kept their batteries in their sensor vests in may the company left with the 
 battalion for wainwright and trained in tank stalking heliborne operations section platoon and company level attacks the night life was 
 highlighted by live music on stage at the smoker in june the company conducted mountain training again basic mountaineering was 
 emphasized with mountain walks route marches rope bridging and some technical climbing moments worth remembering come along in the life 
 of all regiments this summer charlie company was heavily involved 0:involv 0:ed in the 75th anniversary of the founding of 
 the regiment the men participated in the trooping of the colours and the sunset 0:sun 0:set ceremony some of the 
 troops also helped a company with their display while the bulk of the company trooped from mid august to the 
 6th of september our company lines were a ghost town upon returning from leave we made ready for ex noble 
 patricia in dundurn for three weeks evenly split between patrolling 0:pat 0:rolling and live fire ranges the patrol exercise was 
 first rate with everyone picking up valuable training we then went through the live fire ranges tunnel range booby trap 
 combat first aid close quarter jungle lane pairs fire and movement section woods clearing section tank stalk and finally the 
 platoon assault on a soviet trench system after a day to rest and clean up the last training item awaited 
 us the military skills competition march and shoot 7 platoon had the honour of having the fastest time 19 minutes 
 ahead of the next fastest platoon even so 7 platoon came 3rd on the competition a fraction of a point 
 from ist place the exercise closed with a visit from major general carstens of west germany the nato amf l

 a busy yet productive time for combat support company besides our regular exercises the year was highlighted by rendezvous 89 
 and the 75th national reunion exercise polar warrior was designed to put the l in the ppcli and in some 
 cases this affected combat support our contribution took the form of support to a live fire airmobile raid and company 
 ambush pioneers offered their expertise as an enemy force and recce allowed themselves to be intercepted in an adm company 
 hide sgt walker of mortar platoon found out the hard way that it s easier to let the helicopter land 
 first before you dismount all the platoons in the company found themselves running respective training courses all workups for exercise 
 ry 89 paid off as anti armour platoon set the best tracking record and placed second in the brigade live 
 fire competition the company s 0:com 0:pany 0:s major task turned out to be the construction of the live fire 
 defensive position for exercise sterling maniple for which most of the labour and expertise was provided by pioneers and mortars 
 preparations for the 75th anniversary were never ending however all the hard work was not in vain members of the 
 company found themselves with many different tasks from pounding the parade square to filling sandbags for the better ole there 
 were good times to be had and several members of mortar platoon found themselves well bedded in in the better 
 ole after a well deserved leave period the company left a week before the rest of the battalion for dundurn 
 saskatchewan for the build up to exercise noble patricia after platoon training and completion of the personal weapons tests we 
 worked like madmen to finish a number of ranges that focused on everything from individual close quarter fighting to platoon 
 0:pla 0:toon bunker destruction sgt skibinsky was finally able to show the devious and cunning side of his personality at 
 the booby trap range support was also given to the battalion patrol competition and the march and shoot competition the

 summed up in two words administration company did 1 forget to mention that we are also humble and modest in 
 january 1989 administration company decided to deploy to wainwright to support the battalion winter exercise all was going well until 
 someone had the nerve to attack a echelon was this a joke imagine the disappointment of our attackers 0:attack 0:ers 
 when we exited our tents yelling keep the noise down can t a man get any sleep around here ry 
 89 was also an enjoyable 0:en 0:joyable exercise the game risk was played with much frequency and was used to 
 hone our razor sharp battle skills i don t know why we don t abolish black out conditions at night 
 time because it makes it difficult to see the pieces as anybody who is somebody knows this summer we celebrated 
 our 75th anniversary what fun we had administration 0:administra 0:tion company was a stalwart supporter of all the social festivities 
 of the 75th and much to the chagrin of the rifle companies we just couldn t keep the girls away 
 i mean who would you rather dance with a suave and debonaire vehicle technician or a carl gustav operator a 
 handsome and well groomed supply technician or a c 6 gunner girls you made the right choice remember us at 
 the 100 th anniversary one of our crowning achievements this year was the french grey cup we started the day 
 by winning top marks for our float a most realistic rendition of a viking long ship granted our mermaid was 
 no great shakes but we were vikings not gq men and could she wield a battle axe the football game 
 was well played but not even close we clobbered them as good vikings do i know we only won by 
 one point in overtime but we were only toying with them before we dealt our death blow next time we 
 hope the gods will send us competition worthy of true vikings as we prepare for our upcoming exercise in chilcotin 
 and norway we wisely decided not to risk an ocean crossing in our long ship we will of course take 
 time to enjoy the christmas season administration company wishes all patricias the very best in 1990 cheers vikings in all 
 their regalia please excuse our mermaid adm company victory dance

 perhaps worse than the cold were the insufferable stories if you think this was cold you should have been with 
 us in 81 eyelashes were barely unfrozen before we were into regimental day and broom i 100 a cold crisp

 sticks for the record combat support company emerged as champions and the officers and senior ncos went into shoot out 
 overtime with the warrant officers and sergeants uncharacteristically keeping their old legs functioning long enough in eight inches of snow 
 to win as one officer observed it is foolish to start a rivalry with a man who outweighs you by

 did more with night and gas to enliven events helicopters from 408 squadron edmonton were added so that each company

 exercised its freedom of the city freedom weekend reaffirmed the regimental link with a march from mayor william norrie s

 sword blades around the guards the weather held for this one by 10 august the remainder of patricias from winnipeg 
 including jimmy vaughan were turning up at the better ole and slapping the backs of everyone they knew the displays 
 parties and ceremonies were fantastic and the moment when the new guard marched off the trooping and though the old 
 guard will be remembered forever by all that saw it some even claimed that the left marker of three guard 
 was audibly sobbing by that stage after the parade col j r big jim stone spoke to the second battalion

 feeling and counting the days until pay day and leave second battalion guard led by major eckley during the ottawa 
 ceremonies ottawa and ceremony leave passed all too quickly and soon a company was back in the field this time 
 ontario on something called expert angler that saw its members dangling from cliff faces by thin ropes and developing distinctly 
 tourist habits in and on the local lakes but this was just a preamble for a company s real job 
 was in ottawa where on 9 september they represented the regiment in a combined patricia van doo parliament hill ceremony 
 again it was magnificent and in several respects unique major mark eckley is likely the only serving patricia field officer 
 who has followed a goat on parade and has the boots to prove it the a company 0:com 0:pany guard

 day the unit remembered its sacrifices in several ceremonies near 11 a m four companies held a battalion service at 
 kapyong barracks and read from the roll of honour while adm company paraded at the winnipeg convention centre as part 
 of the city program that afternoon the second battalion 0:battal 0:ion in conjunction with the lord selkirk society unveiled a

 the patrician 36 where s that gopher freedom of the city more courses more sports more duty more honour the 
 battalion now settled into winter routine which meant playing the french grey cup on an iced field with a 1600 
 wind chill factor in the best played tightest game in years soccer and baseball finals were played under the same 
 conditions it was probably more than mere coincidence that the berlin wall was coming down as this tenacity spirit and 
 lack of concern for the elements was being demonstrated by the regiment s central front battalion the courses wound down 
 and more drafts disappeared off to wainwright to produce the next generation of patricias the new brigade commander bgen brian 
 vernon cd came east to verify weather reports and discovered that manitoba despite the mercury levels in thermometers still has 
 more hours of sunshine per year than anywhere else in the country the seventy fifth year ended quietly for second 
 battalion on 15 december at the annual men s christmas dinner where all the old traditions were befittingly maintained on 
 completion of the awards the formal carving of the turkey and the issue of regimental blue the battalion issued leave 
 passes this was more than christmas leave it was a rest and family time before the battalion heads for cyprus 
 family time in both the domestic and regimental senses of the word has been important to the unit in this 
 year with the hectic schedule many members of the battalion were active in ensuring the families 0:fami 0:lies were not 
 left out of the special events or indeed disserviced by them honourable mention in 1989 must therefore go not only 
 to the officers and men of the unit who so willingly gave of their time for family days terry fox 
 day charity efforts displays sunday brunches and so on but especially to the wives breakaway club for its excellent efforts 
 in support of the families and to the winnipeg regimental association for its unfailing enthusiastic support to all battalion endeavours 
 and to its old black magic that is so obviously manifest when the old guard parades meanwhile the weather here 
 in manitoba is untypically predictable

 live fire training was conducted for the most part the first three days of the deployment centred upon dry training 
 which emphasized section and platoon battle drills the first few days also presented a good opoportunity for all ranks to 
 further their patrol skills in both recce and fighting patrols some made good use of the excellent fibua facility during 
 this period as well the rest of the deployment for the rifle companies was dedicated to live fire which ranged 
 from pairs through section and up to platoon level live fire ranges also the tire village did not escape the 
 bullets and grenades of the third battalion as live fire fibua training was conducted as well at the end of

 previous experience was not necessary and that one doesn t even need to use the boards to stop as long

 the west edmonton mall and ending at the sherlock holmes pub in downtown 0:down 0:town edmonton the event took place 
 in the middle of july this year with 20 teams entered no canadian team had ever competed in the event 
 lieutenant colonel stutt decided to enter a battle school officers team and so with himself leading volunteered captains joe pollock 
 dave niles and pete lundy at first impression the yomp didn t seem to be all that difficult however the 
 distance changed to 23 km with each man carrying 30 lbs of weight and to make things interesting somewhere along 
 the route a log would be carried for 3 2 km then to make it a memorable competition a beer 
 keg full would be carried up the macdonald hotel steps all 500 of them out of the 20 teams 16 
 were british and for the first time four canadian teams entered the battle school officers team finished first amongst the 
 canadian teams with a time of three hours and 27 minutes the winning team was from the 2nd battalion light 
 infantry with a time of two hours and 30 minutes two of the members from this team jointly hold the 
 world record for a 100 mile run in full fighting order which was done in 23 hours and 47 minutes 
 the battle school plans to enter next year s competition with two teams as lieutenant colonel stutt stated half way

 the patrician 63 ppcli battle school recruit company 2lt k p gentles our story begins with johnny jenkins in a 
 classroom at hayseed school in rural saskatchewan his teacher is droning on about something or other and as usual john 
 is keenly alert his eyes are closed and his body slumped his mind is elsewhere 0:else 0:where for yesterday he 
 was at the recruiting centre and was given the word that he s off to cornwallis for basic training he 
 asked for infantry and got it his father was a soldier in world war ii and often said the ppcli 
 is the only way to go of this john is convinced he will be a patricia indeed after ten weeks 
 pte jenkins is no longer a long haired civy but a keen soldier ready for the ppcli pt was no 
 problem and the army thing was too easy who can t press shirts and polish brass wait a minute what 
 s this about wainsomething 0:wain 0:something battle school no leave seventeen weeks what can they teach us in 17 weeks 
 and who s this bad tempered sergeant with the attitude doesn t he know that we re not recruits anymore 
 wainwright beautiful wainwright the quonset huts remind pte jenkins of the movie stalag 17 seventeen alright seventeen weeks of hell 
 how do they expect us to run five miles wearing boots indeed recruit training at the battle school is not 
 what most expect cornwallis does little to prepare the new soldier for the intense training schedule in recruit company in 
 addition to learning patrolling battle drills in the various phases of war a new soldier must master all of the 
 weapons at the platoon s disposal including c 7 c 9 c 6 m 72 carl gustav 60 mm mortar 
 and grenades he must learn regimental history and map using as well as fieldcraft and unarmed combat all his training 
 has one single minded purpose to close with and destroy the enemy by day or night regardless of season 0:sea 
 0:son weather or terrain we do not mince words in the battle school for our role is clear we are 
 training to kill as such an important aspect of the soldier s training is physical daily workouts do not train 
 him to run marathons but to enable him to cover great distances with his personal and platoon kit and be 
 able to fight aggressively for extended periods when he gets there recruit company set the battle school standard of battle 
 fitness this year with the co s endurance 0:endur 0:ance run the run is a 5 km crosscountry course wherein 
 the platoon must run with fighting order carrying its support weapons 0:wea 0:pons and radio new records were set for 
 both summer and winter serials by pursuit to mons platoon serial 8908 and northwest 0:north 0:west europe platoon serial 8909 
 with times of 30 26 and 32 36 respectively a soldier learns that he is not alone but a part 
 of a fine team in a section in a platoon when graduation comes at the end of the long haul 
 and the platoon joins the regiment one can feel the pride radiate from each man as he receives his patricia 
 hat badge the new patricias show off their skills to their family and friends and join their battalion as well

 64 the patrician 2 commando capts m k fawcett r j hachey and lc hope i 989 was a busy 
 year for 2 commando our travels took us several thousand miles to many interesting places and to 1 many new 
 adventures the new year brought misfortune with the tragic loss of five of our comrades in a car accident the 
 commando did not deploy on winter exercises in order to properly bid farewell to our lost comrades exercise black leopard 
 in february the commando turned its attention toward ex black leopard 11 a local exercise in which us blackhawk helicopters 
 were gladly employed the americans were even so generous as to allow many 2 commando personnel to experience a jump 
 from their excellent aircraft following this exercise the commando headed to valcartier for a week of ski school exchange to 
 fort bragg small unit exchange three words that are music to a paratrooper s ears visions of foreign jump wings 
 bare ass jumps and exotic locations come to mind the prospect of ten days in sunny north carolina was a 
 definite morale boost to all ranks of 2 commando on arrival we grudgingly rolled up our sleeves and prepared ourselves 
 for some tropical living our host was a coy 1 504 parachute infantry regiment 82nd airborne division they graciously briefed 
 us on the intelligence 0:intelli 0:gence we would desperately need local customs and watering holes training was fast and furious 
 initially we trained on our own at the mout site military operations in urban terrain a stone and concrete town 
 complete with a sewer system the training progressed to a live fire mout range troops tested their skills in various 
 ways individual ranges with targets popping up in windows and doors team obstacle courses where bullets and grenades filled the 
 air and a section house clearing range in which speed and violence won the day naturally some recreation was undertaken 
 during breaks in the intense training our american hosts provided us with a sports day and a trip to myrtle 
 beach the commando advanced to the finals in soccer football and earthball however our smaller numbers took their toll the 
 free beer helped to slow things down as well we placed third out of six companies competing 0:com 0:peting we 
 did however make many new friends in time to borrow their cars for the trip to the beach recreation finished 
 we returned to war the commando jumped into dz sicily from 800 feet and moved into ambush positions at best 
 speed the 1 504 drove the enemy back into our blocking positions as we caught them between a rock and 
 a hard place following a day of regrouping the maroon machine rolled again this time as a battalion vanguard for 
 a helicopter 0:hel 0:icopter assault we roared in at dawn just 100 meters from the mout site and found ourselves 
 fighting a pitched battle along streets and in buildings realism was added with the use of miles laser engagement equipment 
 the commando earned praise for its efforts in the battle and some excellent lessons were learned in all it was 
 a perfect example of an exchange 0:ex 0:change we returned to cold wet petawawa with tans and many tall tales 
 rvb9 oon 19 may 2 commando deployed to penhold alberta from where we would stage to wainwright the regiment spent 
 three days conducting platoon and commando training and battle procedure before moving into a regimental staging area 2 commando prepared 
 for an airmobile operation and the commando discovered the perils of landing on a hot dz on the 27th the 
 commando returned to penhold to prepare for the second phase of the divisional exercise the regiment 0:regi 0:ment was to 
 jump into the fmc division rear area and conduct interdiction operations the pickings for 2 commando were fruitful the exercise 
 ended with all three commandos in the defence while the division counter attacked to cap off ry 89 2 commando 
 embarked on exercise pegasus climber at kananaskis climbing roughly 36 kilometres 0:kilo 0:metres over 8000 foot peaks and across some 
 of the most spectacular scenery in the country the exercise was sweaty but pleasant the enemy a guerrilla platoon hiding 
 in a high mountain valley was destroyed early in the operation this enabled the unit to descend the mountains during 
 the last two days in a more relaxed manner a 600 foot rucksack slide down snow and ice saved many 
 a blister and produced some wild noises fun form fitness and suntans were had in a true airborne way 
 65 the patrician nova scotia international tattoo early in june the unit s unarmed combat team departed wainwright to begin 
 rehearsals for their performance in the nova scotia international tattoo the team arrived in halifax in the middle of june 
 to start a rigorous schedule and an even more rigorous social calendar the act began with a one hundred foot 
 rappel from the rafters of halifax s metro centre and then to the tune of taking care of business our 
 soldiers entertained the audience with various fights in the final scene an old lady cpl davidson in drag appeared to 
 stop the needless violence in an attempt to remove her the entire team was of course beaten severely the team 
 gave five performances and proved to be a real crowd pleaser one editorial in the local newspaper panned our act 
 as ugly and violent we took that as a compliment judging from the reception that many young soldiers received from 
 the local girls i can only conclude it wasn t that ugly the ppcli 75th anniversary in the summer months 
 a young soldier s thoughts often turn to drill especially when they spend several hours a day on the square 
 the commando deployed to calgary by c 130 on the 24th of july our time preceding the 75th celebrations was 
 spent largely on the parade square although time was found for the occasional road run and even the odd night 
 out 2 commando had the honour of kicking off the celebrations with our para assault on dz patricia followed by 
 an ry in the better ole 1 am sure much will be written about the other celebrations for our part 
 the trooping was of course the highlight the weeks of preparation were more than worthwhile as we marched off through 
 the old guard although we wore a different hat badge it felt great to be a patricia and i may 
 be biased but i heard many many people comment that four guard was by far the best at least different 
 on 9 september we continued the 75th celebrations with a joint ppcli r22er parade on parliament hill the following day 
 some of our soldiers dressed in world war i uniforms reenacted 0:re 0:enacted the return of the patricias to ottawa 
 following the first world war fall training returning to petawawa the unit underwent a re organization after welcoming a crop 
 of new guys from the battalions on the 28th of september the platoons jumped in and each set out to 
 conduct live fire ambushes october brought the p t test followed by the much loved 2xlo miles this was such 
 a favourite with the troops we decided the only thing that could top it would be an nbcd refresher so 
 that s what we did we managed to conduct some collective training including ex lightfoot an airmobile assault on the 
 arnprior dam the enemy an insidious terrorist group had seized the dam as a bargaining tool clearly they had not 
 counted on 2 commando 0:com 0:mando the enemy cleverly concentrated themselves in the dam and in their hooches after a 
 spirited defence of their sleeping 0:sleep 0:ing bags they capitulated their demise was short lived however as the terrorists reappeared 
 surprisingly this time they were hiding in the woods at a farm belonging to major pentney s in laws the 
 unit conducted a cordon and search and quickly 0:quick 0:ly captured the rascals other highlights of the fall were a 
 visit from the colonel in chief and an amphibious exercise in support of the path finder 0:path 0:find 0:er course 
 ex neptune raider was a unique experience for most of us as we embarked on hmcs protector to be inserted 
 by landing craft on the beaches of st margrets bay the navy proved wonderful hosts and fed us often and 
 very well sadly the rough seas ensured that much of the food was returned to the navy the raid on 
 mill cove was easily achieved after an all night infiltration during the first week of december we conducted section and 
 pairs live fire exercises including a grenade assault range we capped off 1989 with the traditional men s christmas dinner 
 and some much deserved leave 1989 was an eventful and productive year for 2 commando we soldiered to mark the

 was a busy year for the loyal eddies a year which included several important training and ceremonial events on the 
 training side the year started at a relaxed pace with a well attended ski school in jasper s marmot basin 
 february saw the unit officers in calgary for the 1 brigade study weekend along with their regular and reserve counterparts 
 from the entire army of the west it was an excellent opportunity to practise implementation of the total force army 
 training became more serious with the approach of spring the battle school lent the eddies c 7 rifles c 9 
 light machine guns and help in conversion training while the unit stressed training for defence and patrolling the highlight of 
 spring training was ry 89 several nco s and soldiers were called out to 1 ppcli and the remainder of 
 a company took part in the live fire defensive exercise sterling maniple under the command of a company of the 
 3rd battalion 0:bat 0:talion in addition to looking after its trained soldiers the unit concluded a basic training course for 
 northern alberta militia district in june milcon 89 the concentration of prairie area militia units in wainwright during july was 
 well attended by loyal eddies in addition to providing a relatively large number of infantrymen the unit also filled a 
 number of senior positions in the infantry battle group and oversaw three very successful field firing ranges training carried on 
 after milcon as members of the loyal eddies attended schools from the atlantic to the pacific as students and staff 
 the fall training program included the usual round of shooting defence and patrolling exercises but finished with the unusual exercise 
 northern strike iv in banks island northwest territories the exercise planned as a sovereignty operation included a parachute descent survival 
 training with the canadian rangers tactical movement and a successful community relations program 1989 also included some important ceremonial events

 the patrician 70 the french grey battalion capt w a pigden and capt r d parent the past year has 
 been a busy and eventful time for members of the french grey battalion here in gagetown a full slate of 
 75th anniversary events as well as the normal course training cycle has kept all members busy and feeling part of 
 the regimental family the year s ceremonial festivities were kicked off in fine fashion with the 17th of march regimental 
 day celebrations featuring 0:fea 0:turing the annual broom i 100 competition between officers senior nco s and soldiers a well 
 attended all ranks dance the previous evening a good solid base of snow and the fortifying effects of down home 
 moose milk courtesy of our patricia base surgeon major ken lacey and his swish barrels all had the competitors primed 
 for the games following a round robin series of hard fought matches the soldiers emerged victorious proving once again youth 
 and aggression waste their energy playing games in the annual officers senior nco grudge match despite the senior nco s 
 dubious tactic of importing several free agents from that other patricia hideaway cornwallis the officers still came away with a 
 decisive and rare victory by a score of one to nil later in the spring the gagetown patricias found themselves 
 making up part of an honour guard which included personnel 0:per 0:sonnel from the french grey battalion members of the 
 old guard of the regimental association and the saint mary s band all taking part in the freedom of the 
 city of saint john on the 12th of may 1989 this ceremony acknowledged the special relationship 0:re 0:lationship between the 
 city of saint john the saint mary s band which served as the ppcli regimental band during the first world 
 war and the regiment itself a reception was held following the parade and was attended by participants and their families 
 as well as the city fathers with all ranks enjoying the fine music and free beer issue the free shout 
 was provided 0:pro 0:vided by a local businessman bgen retired oland and the parade commander major r shutte who in

 instructors and staff of the infantry school and ctc gagetown the permanent members of the battalion comprising 12 officers 24 
 ncms and 58 soldiers with the help of those fortunate enough to be attached posted as increment staff have an 
 important part in the training and development of our future leaders patricias were well represented in several positions at the

 the phase ii candidates and capts bob parent and perry son of apollo metaxas providing the final polish to the 
 phase iv candidates under the direction of capt phil tyrrell the summer training syllabus has always meant long hours and 
 seven day work weeks however this year was also marked by a plague of mosquitoes of biblical proportion fortunately all 
 ranks were rewarded with a very satisfying conclusion 0:conclu 0:sion to summer training the visit of the colonel in chief 
 lady patricia and the colonel of the regiment brigadier general graham to take part in the officer graduation ceremonies and 
 75th anniversary activities lady patricia was the guest of honour at an all ranks luncheon which was highlighted by her

 the patrician 76 1 989 was a relatively quiet year for the patricias on extra regimental employment at cfb chilliwack 
 mostly the 75th anniversary 0:an 0:niversary was celebrated in fine fashion at the home station with the better ole being 
 the focus of attention many of us renewed old friendships and were hard pressed to remember the new ones the 
 schools here maintain their busy schedules with the patricias being in the thick of it conducting back to back courses 
 seems to be the norm with an endless flow of candidates to train from base operations to general military training 
 there continues to be a patricia influence exerted this is quite clear to all who pass through training here this 
 diamond year for the regiment has seen the retirement of three patricias wo duke fall wo gil hopkins and cpl 
 warren featherstone choosing to end their service and pursue other interests there was also an influx of called out patricias 
 from the lower mainland area to form the basis of a regimental regime wo jim schulz and wo ken mcleod 
 despite chilliwack being the best place to spend an extra regimental employment many of us are looking forward to returning 
 to regimental duty wherever it may be postings here continue to keep our numbers spirits strong once again preparations 0:pre

 we all came together on 17 march to celebrate that special occasion with the local association chaps and the 3

 78 the patrician toronto area patricias captain b c bailey 1 989 brought many changes for the patricias of the 
 greater toronto region perhaps the most notable change was the change of the senior serving patricia colonel almstrom departed for 
 mobile command headquarters after two years as chief of staff for central militia area headquarters and major general stewart arrived 
 to command the new land forces central area lfca hq while the arrival of major general stewart is most welcomed 
 by all ranks colonel almstrom s presence as the representative for regimental affairs will be missed major tweedie remained at 
 central militia area headquarters 0:head 0:quarters and was designated as the representative for regimental affairs by major general stewart major 
 ramsden arrived from the first battalion to become the gl plans at lfca headquarters although many patricias remained in toronto 
 there were significant changes in employment major diakow relinquished 0:relinquish 0:ed his duties as so2 ops at toronto militia district 
 headquarters to become the chief of staff of the district this impacted on the manning of the headquarters as captain 
 cunningham was retained despite his efforts to escape to cornwallis captain day was moved from the toronto scottish regt to 
 join the operations and training cell at district headquarters he has barely been seen in his new capacity as he 
 has become preoccupied with staff school and the intermediate operations course warrant officer snea was not left to carry the 
 regimental flag alone with the toronto scottish regt major lansey left the second battalion to become the first regular force 
 deputy commanding officer of a militia unit rumours are that he has developed a fondness for kilts and acquired a 
 preference for scotch the patricias supporting the queen s own rifles also changed after a lengthy and enjoyable career warrant 
 officer halcrow retired after a year in toronto this created a vacancy which was filled by warrant officer charlebois who 
 arrived from the airborne regiment captain rock weigand was temporarily intoxicated with visions of becoming a fighter pilot but he 
 came to his senses and returned to the regimental fold rock was heard commenting that the flying was easy it 
 was the landing that hurt in any case captain weigand has returned to toronto where he is now employed at 
 central militia area headquarters as staff officer personnel the patricia presence with the 48th highlanders was cut entirely as captain 
 waddell who harboured ambitions of returning 0:re 0:turning to regimental duty early was seconded to serve as the personal aide 
 to major general stewart clearly the first draft of his autobiography is progressing well and will be entitled either the 
 secret of their success or practice makes perfect sergeant lilly also left the 48th highlanders but he too remained in 
 toronto at the recruiting centre sergeant lilly was enthusiastically 0:en 0:thusiastically greeted on arrival by sergeant fry as it permitted 
 sergeant lilly to leave toronto and return to the airborne regiment master corporal aver returned to duty with the first 
 battalion and was replaced by master corporal hickey in a one for one deal to keep captain bailey company with 
 the hasty pees in belleville incidentally captain bailey is the only unit support 0:sup 0:port officer of the best and 
 brightest to remain for a third year no comment other patricias in the toronto area for 1989 include the three

 the regimental day celebrations were again successful despite the decision not to hold the traditional broom i 100 game due 
 to the exceptionally good playing conditions a vast amount of wet snow even the challenge from the captains against all 
 comers was not enough to initiate a game the day s celebrations were highlighted by the presentation of the regimental 
 achievement award to colonel syd frost who was genuinely surprised and appreciative and the retirement presentations to warrant officer halcrow 
 the serving members and the hamilton and toronto branches of the association enjoyed a dining in in november where talk 
 of the regiment s 75th celebrations in both calgary and ottawa pervaded the evening for those who did not attend 
 0:at 0:tend the calgary celebrations it was an opportunity to enjoy the event vicariously major general stewart has vigorously been 
 promoting close ties between the serving patricias and the association and two more joint functions are planned for our regimental

 88 the patrician the royal green jackets the first battalion the first half of 1989 has been notable more for 
 its turbulence in terms of changes in the command structure than for any major battalion commitments nevertheless looking back on 
 the last six months there has been a lot going on not only has the commanding officer changed and we 
 were delighted to welcome lieutenant colonel simon stanford tuck to the battalion in february but all commpany commanders except one 
 have changed as has every key appointment in battalion headquarters except the second in command all support platoon commanders and 
 most headquarter company officers the one advantage of these changes is that the colonel should have a fairly stable team 
 for the next 18 months to see him through what looks like a busy training year in 1990 it has 
 of course produced its ups and downs in the short term our major operational commitment this year has been to 
 liveoak the tripartite allied not nato treaty which was created after the berlin blockade it is a treaty with a 
 high political profile which involves the battalion in a tripartite battle group based on 1 rgj but with american tanks 
 and french gunners it is a unique commitment which is not particularly testing in the tactical sense but is fun 
 and very interesting we have already hosted a most successful study period and are looking forward to the ftx in 
 late august in addition we have had our usual full share of baor training commitments to cpx s ftx s 
 at battle group brigade and divisional level we have also sent our mortar and milan platoons on specialist concentrations recently 
 we returned from a two week firing camp at sennelager which was made especially challenging this year as for the 
 first time we had the opportunity to use the infantry s new hand held light anti tank weapon law 80 
 it has proved itself a very good system with its own particularly well designed and enjoyable training package including simulators 
 and sub calibre devices on the sporting front we have had a most successful boxing season our team became 1 
 armoured division boxing champions and we have three baor champions who went on to the army finals where rifleman waterhouse 
 became the army middleweight novice champion companies are now training hard for our own annual novices competition and with last 
 year s success to build on we hope to field a strong team next season the battalion has also had 
 a most successful swimming 0:swim 0:ming team swimming is not a sport which we have previously looked upon as a 
 high priority but we nevertheless came third in the baor major unit championship and rifleman cornhill is the baor record 
 holder for the 50m butterfly at easter time we also mounted a mountaineering expedition to the alps led by captain 
 nick martyn our ppcli exchange 0:ex 0:change officer unfortunately blizzards and avalanches prevented the team from completing the haute route 
 and climbing to the top of mont blanc but they certainly had some excellent and exciting climbing we are most 
 grateful to jaguar deutschland whose general sponsorship made the whole venture possible also at easter time we said a goodbye 
 to the peninsula band who have been attached to us for the last two years we have missed them particularly 
 as it has left baor with no light division band we wish them well for their tour in dover and 
 hope to see them soon when they visit germany later this year at this stage most considerations were shaped by 
 what was undoubtedly the year s major commitment our role as the leading contingent in the liveoak tripartite battlegroup which 
 forms yearly to signify allied resolve to maintain free land access to berlin the exercise known as exercise treaty in 
 june saw a company of united states cavalry ml abrams from 2 66 armour arrive at sennelager along a battery 
 of fearsome looking french 155 mm sp guns the artillery were to demonstrate that their stunning firepower was achieved at 
 the expense of decidedly cutprice running gear international incidents were narrowly avoided and treaty was adjudged successful though things looked 
 dicey when ribald comments issued from a sweetly running 432 overtaking a broken down french howitzer rather presumptuously titled waterloo 
 in august we welcomed capt qgo lachhimprasad gurung who became 2ic support company he will be sorely missed 0:miss 0:ed 
 when he leaves in january 90 we are eternally grateful to him that he was happy to be known as 
 lachhim particularly when it came to writing nominal rolls in september the battalion deployed as part of 22 armoured brigade 
 on the 1 armoured division ftx white rhino this year it was decided that a new concept would be trialled 
 designed to limit the exercise damage which is so costly in terms not only of money but also of local 
 goodwill the idea was that brigade ftxs would be run followed by a divisional command force exercise cfx o group 
 vehicles only staying in the field in week 2 the cfx attracted much comment which will likely lead to a 
 new improved version next year a cpx ftx cfx mix may be the pattern of future baor exercises whatever comes 
 of this exercises stag rhino and white rhino proved a testing run out for men and machines some vehicles covering 
 600 track miles many lessons were learned not the least that the ability to speak a little german ensures a 
 better barn also in september letter b company were cut to 1 ge corps for their ftx offences visier open 
 sights once they had deciphered the encyclopaedic op order they were relieved to find that a german ftx consists of 
 a lot of meticulously 0:meticu 0:lously planned movement and little else so the company commander s undoubted flair for augtragstaktik 
 remained untested 0:un 0:tested 
 89 the patrician in addition in october the ops officer organized an airmobile exercise in schleswig holstein despite herculean labours 
 by him the time of year was simply incompatible with low level flying and the exercise was not an unqualified 
 success 1989 has been a full and rewarding year for 1 rgj during which inevitable frustrations including a necessary reduction 
 to 2 platoons per company have been more than countered by successes at every level and in many fields the 
 2nd battalion the past twelve months have been varied interesting and challenging for the second battalion the main features of 
 the year being a four month operational tour in northern ireland our conversion to saxon and our deployment to the 
 continent on a major nato exercise january 1989 found the battalion in the final stages of preparing for a forthcoming 
 tour in northern ireland of interest is our reinforcement during our work up training before christmas by a composite platoon 
 formed by 1 and 3 rgj to provide a fourth platoon for c company and 2lt charles bather from 2 
 2 gr to command a platoon in d company we returned from christmas leave on 2nd only to leave that 
 day for almost all of the remainder of the month to complete various range and dry training packages from february 
 to june 1989 the battalion deployed to northern ireland tac hq with b and d companies under command 0:com 0:mand 
 joined 3 infantry brigade and were responsible for most of east fermanagh while a and c companies were detached to 
 4 also part of 3 brigade and 8 udr respectively the improvements in the situation since the formation of 3 
 infantry brigade 0:bri 0:gade were clear and our tour was relatively quiet though we did have some narrow escapes and 
 just missed catching a terrorist 0:ter 0:rorist red handed we had the added advantage of being near friends brigadier charles 
 vyvyan late rgj was our brigadier and lieutenant colonel james carter rgj was 8 udr s commanding officer after well 
 earned leave we spent july and august running a multiplicity of internal cadres mainly based in dover and took delivery 
 of our saxon apcs this helped to prepare us for ex plain sailing in september in which we practised defending 
 0:de 0:fending the lines of communication on the continent the added activities which we had organized which included one company 
 s attachment to the belgian army and another adventure training in bavaria helped to compensate for the main exercise which 
 for various reasons lacked any real excitement to gain time for uninterrupted training in the early months of next year 
 we had volunteered to meet as many external commitments as possible in october the powers that be did not let 
 us down october was thus a hectic month with companies 0:com 0:panies deploying all over the country in support of 
 amongst others the school of infantry rma sandhurst and 23 sas november was largely devoted to shooting on lydd and 
 hythe ranges first a week long mandatory range package in preparation 0:pre 0:paration for spearhead then two weeks devoted to 
 completing the apwt culminating in a two day battalion skill at arms meeting during the month we also completed the 
 major task of getting ourselves and our equipment ready for spearhead with all the preparations and inspections that this entails 
 despite our various commitments we have had time to put much emphasis on sport and many other leisure pursuits since 
 returning from northern ireland the latter included sending a platoon to gibraltar for a month entering a team for the 
 nijmegen marches and sending four riflemen to america for the world martial arts championships as i write we are in 
 the process of completing our annual inter platoon competition before standing down for christmas we remain on spearhead until the 
 end of december and keep our fingers crossed that no unforeseen emergency will require 0:re 0:quire our return from leave 
 we look forward to another challenging year in 1990 which includes a six week exercise in canada the 3rd battalion 
 the summer months in gibraltar arrived with the battalion well established in its routine of guards ceremonial duties and operational 
 commitments for the whole summer we had companies deployed successively in the uk on training and with this and a 
 second company on leave we found ourselves very light on the ground combined with our own absences 0:ab 0:sences we 
 were required to host a succession of ta companies on exercise from the uk and a casual onlooker faced with 
 the plethora of non green jacket capbadges could have been forgiven for assuming that 3 rgj had abandoned the rock 
 altogether 0:alto 0:gether one highlight among our ta guests was a company from 5 rgj who gave us the excuse 
 for a most enjoyable joint dinner night in the presence of their colonel commandant general sir peter hudson for the 
 long hot summer we adopted a tropical routine starting early in the morning and finishing work at 1 p m 
 our afternoons were not idle however as we were on standby for a variety of tasks in support of the 
 civilian authorities including fire fighting on the upper rock we deployed once to deal with a large fire which threatened 
 some of our married quarters and were amused to note that 2 rgj had dealt with a similar fire in 
 the same place on exactly the same day in august 1975 naturally we claim a speedier and more effective solution 
 to the problem 
 the patrician 90 by mid october the last company had returned from training in the uk and life in barracks 
 began to assume a more normal aspect ceremonial duties moved to the forefront again and in a two month period 
 we found guards for the ceremony 0:cere 0:mony of the keys the visit of cds a royal visit from the 
 duke of kent the departure of he the governor and finally the arrival 0:ar 0:rival of his relief training was 
 not neglected of course and a company deployed a team to the uk where they won a very creditable silver 
 medal in the cambrian patrol competition hq company went mountain climbing in the snow covered hills of morocco the snow 
 gets deeper every time the story is repeated and a hardy band of amateur historians visited the battlefields 0:bat 0:tlefields 
 of the peninsula war in spain the battlefield tour covered salamanca much of the retreat to corunna and vigo and 
 to get the full flavour of the event walked 25 miles of the route one day to give themselves a 
 worthy appetite for dinner in november our attention turned to more traditional activities as we prepared for the gibraltar biennial 
 tri service ftx a study day and deployment exercise provided a little practice in the skills of key point defence 
 and inter service communications 0:com 0:munications and then at the end of the month we deployed for 4 days along 
 with our colleagues from the gibraltar regiment 0:regi 0:ment to fight off the orange hoard 10 000 sandbags were filled 
 subversive bishops man handled and unexploded bombs avoided while we defended our positions and as ever concluded with a last 
 desperate enemy attack in some of the most un mediterranean weather seen for many years we then moved swiftly from 
 the exercise to the annual inter platoon tarleton trophy to round off the year before christmas leave the competition a 
 round robin of individual and team tests provided a suitable and keenly contested conclusion to our 1989 training the 4th 
 battalion rm he year 1989 has again been a busy one with members of the battalion exercising at home and 
 overseas as far away as j canada germany and kenya individually and in groups it has also been a year 
 of change on the staff list colonel the right hon the lord holderness relinquished his appointment as honorary colonel after 
 twenty seven years on the 30 november 1989 and handed over to a former rifleman lord nicholas gordon lennox lately 
 her majesty s ambassador 0:am 0:bassador to spain lt col neil johnson handed over command in april 1989 to lt 
 col jamie daniell colonel neil went back to civilian life after three years as a regular and now helps to 
 run the land rover organization colonel jamie joins us from hq the light division winchester after a short period of 
 being a media star with the bbc major nick mangnall handed over to major jan dirk yon merveldt as training 
 major in july 1989 nick has gone to northern ireland on promotion to command the bth bn of the ulster 
 defence regiment capt james cunliffe the adjutant handed over to capt james moberly who joins us via 2 rgj after 
 being adc to goc northern ireland james cunliffe has gone to gibraltar with 3 rgj to enjoy the mediterranean sunshine 
 the early part of 1989 included an exceedingly wet weekend in wales where the inter section competition was carried out 
 in march the battalion achieved 2nd 7th 18th and 22nd place out of 33 entries in the london district courage 
 trophy a military multi discipline competition we also ran and helped with exercise executive stretch where 90 exhausted executives 0:execu 
 0:tives enjoyed themselves so much that it has become a permanent event every spring on the shooting side we had 
 an enjoyable joint skill at arms meeting with 5 rgj as a prelude to the london district meeting 0:meet 0:ing 
 at which we won an embarrassing amount of silver in spite of this early success the ultimate goal of winning 
 the territorial 0:terri 0:torial army bisley competition escaped us as we only managed to achieve second overall place this was 
 a particular disappointment 0:disap 0:pointment to colour sergeant wiggins who has for so many years been so very close to 
 the queen s medal at bisley in early july the second in command ran a successful battalion exercise on salisbury 
 plain which was made the more memorable by the mortar officer appearing in only pullover green trousers and city shoes 
 having locked himself out of his flat this form of dress certainly says something for the enthusiasm of the ta 
 volunteers who will turn up irrespective of what the difficulties are annual camp in september was in germany where we 
 spent one week on the vogelsang training area in the eifel and the second week acting as enemy to 22 
 armoured brigade in a fast moving battle on the paderborn plain it was a most enjoyable 0:en 0:joyable exercise especially 
 as it gave all the riflemen a variety of things to do and it enabled the battalion and its sub 
 units to carry out their respective roles in a realistic and tactical environment not only did this enhance the exercise 
 for all the volunteers but it also confronted them with a realistic target array of armour mechanized vehicles and helicopters 
 something 0:some 0:thing which we never or seldom achieve on a weekend exercise in october we once more decamped as 
 a battalion to the stanford training area for a weekend exercise run by our local hq 56 london brigade on 
 the domestic front we were delighted to be able to move our b company back into fulham house in october 
 major andrew askham the officer commanding b company marched his company from their temporary accommodation in lytton 0:lyt 0:ton grove 
 through putney high street over the thames into the new and refurbished fulham house where we were lucky to have 
 prince nicholas yon preussen to inspect and to re open the redeveloped ta centre for us this was a historical 
 link with the past as his great grandfather kaiser wilhelm 11 better known as kaiser bill had himself reviewed the 
 queen s westminsters 0:west 0:minsters in 1891 at buckingham palace the queen s westminsters were the traditional forebearers of our 
 b company 
 91 the patrician our h hsf home service company is growing from strength to strength in spite of not having 
 joined the official orbat yet members of the company managed to win the london district hsf competition and bring home 
 a very nice silver pot we are delighted to note that not an inconsiderable number of retired green jackets are 
 joining the hsf many of them quite prepared to drop their substantive rank and to serve as riflemen in this 
 force what will be of particular interest to our allied regiments is that we have now serving with us one 
 canadian one australian 0:austral 0:ian and one new zealand officer in closing this newsletter all of us in 4 rgj 
 wish all of you in our allied and affiliated regiments all the very best for 1990 and should your work 
 bring you to london we will always be happy to see you and should you wish to serve with us 
 during your time in london that too can be arranged in most cases the sth battalion since our last report 
 members of the battalion have been on no less than 3 annual camps since every territorial is only required to 
 do one camp of two weeks the reader could be forgiven for asking why first away was the main camp 
 at thetford for the first half of september with no clear sub unit structure there was rather more of the 
 tail from headquarter company than the teeth of the rifle companies a series of cadres were run these were a 
 recruit cadre a gpmg sustained 0:sustain 0:ed fire cadre and a driving cadre initial scepticism from battalion hq at seeing 
 riflemen dressed in civvies sloping off for a day in the cab of a lorry disappeared with the news of 
 100 pass rate alongside all of this we managed to complete much fitness training field firing and a day off 
 at the norfolk coast two staff sergeants from the us national guard also joined on exchange to sample our training 
 and hospitality as the main body drove back from camp 120 men were assembling in training centres to go on 
 the 2 week exercise marble tor in gibraltar the exercise was likely to happen this year as 3 rgj were 
 still there to be our hosts company headquarters 0:head 0:quarters from letter e company at milton keynes took under command 
 platoons from each rifle company and a composite platoon comprising members of the support platoons on the rock they started 
 on a round robin of tactics skill at arms and adventure training before undertaking a final exercise directed by the 
 co and watched by our honorary colonel general sir peter hudson it involved a beach landing scaling the cliffs and 
 then fighting through the tunnels inside the rock itself meanwhile back at the light division depot the brand new waterloo 
 band 5 rgj were parading for their first camp formed one year earlier by ex band sergeant major wo2 morgan 
 they were now in uniforms and learning to march this they mastered so quickly that by day 9 they were 
 able to give a marching display to various vips the facilities of sir john moore barracks both musical and sporting 
 were greatly appreciated as was the help of the resident regular band the salamanca 0:sa 0:lamanca band the light infantry 
 the highlight of the last part of the year has been the takeover by letter a company of their brand 
 new ta centre in high wycombe since formation in 1987 they have lived in 4 portacabins on the site of 
 an old ta centre the new buildings will be officially opened by hrh the duchess of kent on 26 april 
 1990 as well as a new building we report that we have a new platoon in bisector to tap the 
 area of north oxfordshire for manpower as we head into the last year of the formation process which culminates in 
 our camp in germany in june 1990 we can report that we are 85 recruited and ready to practice our 
 operational role we have benefited enormously from being located in the only single geographical area the green jackets can call 
 their own we hope that anyone from the affiliated regiments oxfordshire and buckinghamshire will contact us 0865 716060 and visit 
 when passing through the light division depot winchester the highlight of the first half of the year was the visit 
 by her majesty the queen mother to the depot on the 25 april it was very much an in house 
 affair with no outside guests primarily she came to see the light infantry members of the depot and to plant 
 a grove of eight copper beech trees in memory of the soldiers killed in the bellygawley bus bombing she also 
 of course saw and talked to many royal green jacket officers and ncos and their families indeed the emphasis was 
 one of a relaxed family day with a light hearted pageant on the role of the depot and a tour 
 round the various training departments thankfully the weather which had been atrocious throughout the preparation was fine if a little 
 cold on the day on the sporting side the depot has acquitted itself well the juniors were sadly beaten in 
 the final of the army junior novice boxing competition but they won the south east district division two football final 
 the permanent staff have also kept the side up by becoming the army minor unit squash champions the south east 
 district squash knock out champions 0:champ 0:ions and the south east district squash league champions sgt howlett aptc is the 
 amateur boxing association bantam weight champion and boxes for great britain 
 92 the patrician throughout the glorious summer of 1989 and into the autumn the depot has continued to grow in 
 strength and at the end of the year is at full strength with 260 adult recruits and 150 juniors in 
 training to achieve a more consistent flow of recruits the system of monthly intakes is to be reintroduced no doubt 
 life at the depot will very soon revert to the system that used to pertain in peninsula barracks as in 
 past years the tattoo in the summer saw several thousand visitors over the three days that it took place this 
 year the emphasis was on the community and ties with hamshire county council who are celebrating their 100 th anniversary 
 to highlight this there was a display by the emergency services police ambulance and fire in a simulated road traffic 
 accident 0:acci 0:dent the metropolitan police dogs also put in an appearance after it was all over we were able 
 to donate over 4 700 00 to various charities the two highlights of the latter part of this year were 
 the expedition to nepal for 12 juniors and the visit of her majesty the queen to open the museum both 
 of which are covered elsewhere in this letter in the sporting world the depot have again set out to maintain 
 the high standard they achieved last year they are already through the ist round of the army cup squash and 
 sgt howlett is away training as the bantam weight for great britain in the commonwealth games he has been nominated 
 combined services sports personality of the year sadly on our annual sporting competition against hms dryad the depot was soundly 
 beaten we will have to redouble our efforts in 1990 the royal australian regiment major a b keech 1 989 
 was a very productive year for the royal australian regiment in a year dominated by exercise kangaroo 89 the largest 
 peacetime exercise for some time the year also saw the regiment continue with its specialized training program 0:pro 0:gram as 
 the majority of the army takes delivery of the disruptive pattern uniforms the phase in of the new individual weapon

 a very interesting and stimulating year 
 the patrician 94 okanagan thompson branch ppcli association a year to remember 1989 t m tom tyson the branch under 
 president bob casement laboured on with the task that had started three years earlier to build a cairn in camp 
 vernon to the memory of all patricias who had served at the vernon military camp with the aid of a 
 50 man honour guard and the corps of drums from the third battalion princess patricia s canadian light infantry in 
 victoria the cairn was unveiled and dedicated on 22 july 1989 major general retired c b ware dso cd a 
 vice patron of the regiment was the official guest at the ceremony this ceremony was the start of the 75th 
 anniversary for the branch later in august a great many of our members attended the national reunion in calgary and 
 took part in the old guard parade with the branch s colours the national reunion was the highlight of the 
 year as some of our members got to talk with our colonel in chief lady patricia in recognition of his 
 dedicated service to the regiment during the 75th anniversary a regimental award was presented to lieutenant colonel retired don ardelain 
 the award was presented at a luncheon held in vernon by tom tyson president 0:presi 0:dent of the branch on

 is very significant in our regimental history it was considered most appropriate now that we report briefly on the history 
 of the branch as a matter of record we also considered that the names of members of the branch who 
 attended the national reunion should be put in print the vancouver branch is one of the oldest and perhaps the 
 oldest continuing branch of the association its origin is found in a group created on the initiative of lyle fraser 
 in 1945 it was a small circle of 25 members mostly world war 1 veterans who undertook to gather annually 
 on the 17th of march to renew comradeship and the regimental spirit the initial 0:in 0:itial meetings which took place 
 in lyles home consisted of a social hour followed by an annual meeting and election of officers 0:of 0:ficers for 
 the following year in the late forties when the branch took its basic form as part of the ppcli association 
 the annual 0:an 0:nual meetings were held in various armouries and hotels in vancouver the fare provided was rudimentary usually 
 beer crackers cheese and pickles this gradually improved with caterers being hired to provide a better meal by 1952 the 
 branch membership was increasing with more veterans of world war ii joining on march 17 1960 the branch held its 
 dinner 0:din 0:ner and meeting in the wet canteen of the irish fusiliers at the stanley park armoury a hot 
 time must have been observed as the entire armoury burnt down in a fire originating in the wet canteen during 
 the small hours of the 18th of march 
 the patrician 95 by 1970 the paid up membership had reached 100 with yearly dues set at 5 00 as 
 the branch matured it became more fraternal and benevolent a minimum of four events per year became the norm the 
 branch also provided a linkage with the department of veterans affairs to help solve members problems it now provides very 
 significant support to the next of kin on the death of a member since 1981 it has published a branch 
 newsletter which is now issued four times per year our branch has grown to a total 134 members and with 
 this it has achieved a stable financial status space does not permit 0:per 0:mit acknowledgement of all the members who

 passing of jack adkin jack joined the ppcli in 1935 and remained a patricia to the end a sad note 
 on which to end such a memorable year vtlaintic branch ppcu association the 75th anniversary year has indeed been an 
 event at atlantic branmch as we are sure it has been for all patricias everywhere our events began with a 
 special visit to the 17th march celebrations by an old korean vet familiar to many of us robbie robertson from 
 brooklyn n y on hand to host robbie and add to the festivities in the branch 4 legion in fredericton 
 was brigadier general lew mackenzie with his own brand of jovial satire and a seemingly endless supply of amusing anecdotes 
 the 12th of may marked a very special occasion for us in the atlantic region through the efforts of lieutenant 
 colonel retd bob dallison the regimental affiliation between st mary s band of saint john n 8 and the patricias 
 was revived to mark the occasion the freedom of the city of saint john was bestowed upon st mary s 
 band in keeping with the spirit of the anniversary year the members of atlantic branch were asked to find an 
 old guard to help exercise the privilege and alongside the band and a new guard from the french grey battalion 
 we marched proudly through the streets of saint john mayor elsie wayne and various civic and provincial officials were on 
 hand to review the parade and receive the salute festivities on 12 may continued at a buffet luncheon at branch 
 14 legion hosted by brigadier general retd phil oland many new acquaintances were forged and many old ones renewed that 
 afternoon our thanks to brigadier general oland were expressed in the form of a patricia plaque presented to him on 
 19 june by bob whittaker our president and brigadier general mackenzie in a small ceremony at oland breweries in saint 
 john any visit of the colonel in chief is a special occasion for patricias and the bth of august was 
 no exception the officers of the french grey battalion hosted an all ranks luncheon which included all atlantic branch members 
 with one notable exception 0:ex 0:ception namely the president bob whittaker when it was brought to lady patricia s attention 
 that bob couldn t attend due to his illness it was arranged that she would visit him at home that 
 afternoon two hours later the colonel in chief and lord brabourne were enjoying tea in the whittaker s sitting room 
 and bob enjoying one of the most memorable moments of his life before departing for calgary on 8 august the 
 colonel in chief traveled to saint john to dedicate a plaque in memory of lance sergeant ch williams who led 
 the st mary s band in the great war he was killed in action at tolloy in 1918 mayor wayne 
 was on hand and presented lady patricia with three 1914 paintings of the regiment at bramshot camp prior to their 
 departure for france the countess departed saint john for calgary that afternoon leaving the atlantic patricias with many fond memories 
 which we will savour for a long time to come atlantic branch patricias were well represented at calgary and one 
 of our number has been painted into posterity in molly lamb boback s vibrant impression of the sunset ceremony yes 
 that lonely figure bedecked with cameras in the lower left foreground of the canvas is none other than our very 
 own roy rushton molly kindly presented her wonderful painting to us at a luncheon in the carleton officers mess on 
 8 december brigadier general mackenzie received the painting for the regiment with bob whittaker jamie reid and bob dallison on 
 hand representing us we are very proud that molly should have chosen to present what we are sure will be 
 a much loved regimental treasure we welcomed her into the patricia family 0:fami 0:ly in true maritime fashion the closing 
 comments this year will be left to a man whose writing stirred our emotion this autumn with its honesty and 
 dignity we speak of course of none other than don landry who so elegantly expressed the feelings of so many 
 eastern patricias in his essay on the 75th celebrations 
 the patrician 97 the trooping was done in blazing heat the regiments proud display was done flawlessly another highlight for 
 me as 1 am sure it was for others was the march past of the old guard when we formed 
 up and were called to attention the 1400 or so of us smashed our feet together in such a manner 
 that drew cheers from our supporters in the stands the right turn command did the same then off we marched 
 to the music of the edmonton police pipe band what a moment as we gave the salute to our colonel 
 in chief our regiment gave a salute to us our regiment never have these words meant more to me than 
 during and since the reunion mayor elsie wayne enjoys some of joe flannigan s entertaining blarney as brigadier general mackenzie

 the patrician 98 united kingdom branch ppcli association 75th anniversary celebrated in britain at the invitation of commander and mrs 
 barry nation the united kingdom branch of the ppcli association marked the 75th anniversary of the raising of the regiment 
 by holding their annual frezenberg day celebration on 6 may at hatch court the founder s home near taunton somerset 
 branch members associates and serving officers of the regiment came from widely separated parts of britain and the continent speaking 
 after lunch the colonel in chief spoke of her pleasure in seeing so many members of the regiment and of 
 the wider regimental family sadly those who had fought in the 1914 18 war were no longer with us but 
 present at hatch were veterans of the second world war and korea and of the years of peace nothing could 
 better prove the unique family tradition of the regiment than the gathering itself present in the founder s home with 
 members of his family were captain alexander ramsay of mar the son of our revered first colonel in chief three 
 grandchildren of francis farquhar our first commanding officer and two daughters of brigadier general pelly who commanded after frezenberg and 
 on the somme ken scott who himself served in the loyal edmonton regiment was the son of colonel lou scott 
 who joined as a private in 1914 was rsm at sanctuary wood and was commissioned in the field representing the 
 royal green jackets were brigadier dick vernon whose wife hazel is a niece of hammie gault and major richard carrow 
 recently returned from being an exchange officer in calgary several serving officers of the regiment and their wives were present 
 including major general bill hewson and colonel barry ashton from brussels hatch court glowed in the warm may sunshine and 
 the members of the party were able to enjoy the grounds and the deer park as well as the elegant 
 interior of the house of particular interest was the fascinating collection of memorabilia of hamilton gault s life in the 
 newly refurbished museum l r h lindsay mr mccoy dusty miller commander nation frezenberg celebration may 6 1989 l r 
 brigadier vernon mrs griffin mrs nation brigadier griffin royal green jackets ppcli band the year 1989 was indeed a special

 in winnipeg with kapyong days parade and a freedom of the city ceremony from there we were off to victoria

 ppcli association and their friends the concert was well attended and from all reports was thoroughly enjoyed 0:en 0:joyed by

 the patrician 101 korean student bursaries mcpl t r groves in korea not all families can afford to send their 
 children to good schools through the hamilton gault memorial fund a number of grade 7 8 students who would otherwise 
 be unable to get a better education are given this opportunity through the hamilton gault memorial fund consequently the children 
 are very grateful for our contribution and strive to excel so the support can be continued they do not take 
 our support lightly nor have they forgotten our sacrifices for their freedom as they continue to honour and remember our 
 korean dead this year the recipients wrote letters of thanks the handwriting of the students which has been translated is 
 meticulous 0:meticu 0:lous an example has been included to reflect the high standard these children demand of themselves we are 
 responding to each of them with a copy of the patrician 89 so they can see the soldiers who continue 
 to support 0:sup 0:port them a copy of one of the letters to the student is displayed dear ambassador how 
 do you do sir i am one of the students who received the bursary from you when you visited the 
 canadian monument in kapyong that bursary was very helpful in paying my school expenses i thank you so very much 
 for your kindness and that of the canadian people i will try to visit canada some day when i grow 
 up my school is located at egok ri kapyong which is surrounded by trees and plenty of flowers i think 
 kapyong itself is a good tourism resort and popular for mountain climbing in the summer as 1 am young i 
 am not familiar with the past war in korea but i have heard many times that the battle in kapyong 
 was very fierce especially the combat on the mountain behind the present canadian monument where many soldiers from both sides 
 were killed to secure that important hill i pay my respects and homage to those brave canadian soldiers who sacrificed 
 their lives to protect our country i often see the guests offering silent prayer in front of the monument for 
 their friends whenever i see these visitors i pledge to myself that there should be no other war in korea 
 or any other place i sincerely thank you canadian people and all those canadian soldiers who gave their lives in 
 the war they fought for us i believe that canada and korea must maintain a good relationship and share a 
 warm heart that cares more for others than oneself i pray for continued prosperity for canada lee sun hyock 
 102 the patrician dear mr ambassador how are you sir with croak of frogs and cuckoo s song we are 
 enjoying a fresh summer season i am choi eun hee a 2nd grade middle school student i am very happy 
 to live in such a fine and clean rural community we young students are hard at work with good teachers
