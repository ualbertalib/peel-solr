 less fun packing water all this in later years i believe weak heads up the steep hill from the lake

 bed of loosened and when considered done en straw and taken on the long drive to town ough was hauled
 out and ends reversed someone suggested singeing rather than in pulling him out the second time the scalding to remove

 water and the pig onto the ground we were able to cut off a bit of roast pork the water
 then ran down and into the fire here and there mostly there ready almost extinguishing it smoked the net result
 was reminiscent of the hog was dragged back onto the a black bear that had been caught in a table
 and it became evident that he was bush fire and got much the worst of the a little too long

 became several inches wide in the middle that was an unwelcome part of our lives and it was not scalded
 a sharp knife did a passable several years before that chapter in the job of shaving history of what was
 ostensibly a small ranch we kids had to carry more water and of horses and cattle was closed long distance
 calls much has been said about the excellent service that edmonton would have obtained had they closed with the bell
 telephone company instead of the automatic exchange but if that service may be judged by their long distance line to
 calgary the city is better without it the journal heard several complaints from merchants who have a large business with
 the south which necessitates the use of the phone and in order to ascertain what foundation there was for these
 reports we went to the central at macdonald s drug store and called up calgary the truth of the statements
 was fully substantiated it took nearly an hour to obtain calgary and nearly an hour before the line was sufficiently
 clear of interruptions to allow of conversation three minutes were consumed with sundry annoyance in the way of cast offs
 and interruptions from intervening places and for the accommodation the generous charge was made of 1 25 the journal is
 informed that he struck the wire at an easy time and that others had waited for two and even three
 hours trying to connect with the southern city and had failed so much for the defects now for the reason
 between the two cities there is one wire provided by the bell company with some twenty exchanges any of these
 intervening exchanges can without any reason being given cut off the two cities or by leaving a plug out prevent
 their connecting an operator there desiring say to call up red deer finds the line blocked at wetaskiwin he then
 works his way along waiting at each step till the speakers on this side are finished until he reaches the
 place desired this is bad enough and if the talkers are taking their time may waste many hours but there
 is a more serious drawback it frequently follows that while working in this manner a call will be sent to
 some intervening place from the other end the line is immediately closed and the work has to be commenced again

 is used here maximilian prince of wied met mas the earliest mention of a maskipiton chkepiton the broken arm at
 fort union on the missouri in 1833 and noted that can be found in the southern set of references there
 can be no doubt that a cree he was wearing a medal with an effigy of chieftain named maskipiton or
 broken arm the president and his people were visiting the american the american trader charles larpenfrontier in the 1830 s
 1840 s and 1850 s teur journeyed north west from fort union apparently this chieftain was known at first into
 the wood mountain area in late januby a name that complimented him on his ary of 1844 and plied the
 crees with liqalterness and sharp sightedness and was uor in order to get their buffalo hides in variously translated as

 of alberta and became well known for his efforts to make peace with the blackfoot his exploits have become common
 knowledge among the people of western canada through the writings of kerry wood 15 and grant macewan 6 a highway
 sign at hobbema gives a brief sketch of his career and maskepetoon park at red deer is named after him
 ‘ s unfortunately much of the information from the second or missionary set of writings is vague and makes no
 reference to any of his experiences on the american frontier this has given rise to suspicions that there may have
 been two maskipitons on the other hand this writer has reason to believe that there was only one according to
 rev egerton young the maskipiton known to missionaries had before his conversion a fierce despotic way and was a man
 of un governable temper the way he treated one of his wives clearly showed this her name was susewisk one
 day she happened to do something that aroused his ire suddenly rushing at her he drew his knife and scalped
 her alive strange to say she survived the dread • ful operation and lived for years after ward although the
 top of her head maskipiton when painted by george catlin was as dry as the old skull in the in
 1832 was identified as he who has eyes surgery of a physician or on the shelf behind him of a
 medical college the rev robert t rundle recorded washington that in 1845 while drinking broken arm a cree by the
 name of broken arm was nearly killed a man named brenow at whitepresent at both the fort laramie treaty mud
 crcek 1 the rev egerton young also council in 1851 and the judith river treaty wrote of maskipiton s initial
 reaction to the in 1 855 american leaders may have felt teachings of christianity his words were that the investment
 in taking him to wash i ll never be a christian as long as there ington had paid dividends in
 gaining his is a scalp to take or a horse to steal from allegiance and that of his people but
 ru the blackfoot dolf kurz a visitor to the frontier who met while it is not clear when it happened
 bras casse in 1851 12 remarked that the it is certain that maskipiton had a change crees traded for the
 most part with the of heart this may have been due in part hudson s bay company and only came
 to the fact that the crees were provided to american posts when their prices were with an alphabet of their
 own the cree especially low 1 and a shrewd trader of syllabics 2 maskipiton was carrying on a long standing
 edwin denig wrote sourly corresoondence with rundle as early as that eyes on each side had proved un 1 844
 and was assisting him in many ways worthy of the attention bestowed upon him when translations of hooks of the
 bible beand had represented the americans as but came available in cree maskipiton was an a handful of people far
 inferior in every eager reader when the rev georce mcrespect to his own denig conceded that dciii gall first met
 him in 1 862 the old chief he still lives is pretty generally despised was rcading from the eighth chapter

 known and need good and very beautifuland all were little further discussion here the problem happy amongst their friends and
 relais to discover whether the maskipiton of tives who had gone before them and where they had everything that the
 the alberta parklands and foothills is the white man loves and longs for but the broken arm of the northern
 american indian could not share their joy and frontier pleasure for all was strange to him and he met none
 of the spirits of his the third source of information paul ancestors and there was none to wel kane s
 meeting with broken arm west of come him no hunting nor fishing nor fort pitt is of assistance in that
 it provides any of those joys in which he used to delightand his spirit grew sad then an opportunity to
 hear about maskipiton the great manitou called him and askfrom a man who was not a missionary ed him why
 art thou sad in this kane met broken arm in a winter encamp beautiful heaven which i have made ment
 in january 1848 kane had been for your joy and happiness and the indian told him that he sighed for
 the travelling since 1 30 that morning and re company of the spirits of his relations corded that they sat
 up late talking so and that he felt lone and sorrowful it is not remarkable that he did not make
 so the great manitou told him that he could not send him to the indian heaa sketch of the chief
 or any of his family yen as he had whilst on earth chosen but tired as he must have been
 he made this one but that as he had been a careful notes of broken arm s comments very good
 man he would send him back about missionary work to earth again and give him another chance he seemed to
 think that they would not be very successful for this tradition sounds much like what though he did not interfere
 with the the broken arm who went to washington religious belief of any of his tribe yet many thought as
 he did and his might have experienced was he in fact idea was that as mr rundell rundle remembering a
 time when all was strange had told him that what he preached to him and he met none of the
 spirits of was the only true road to heaven and his ancestors and there was none to wel mr hunter
 told him the same thing and so did mr thebo thibault and come him no hunting and fishing nor any
 as they all three said that the other of those joys in which he used to delight two were wrong
 and as he did not and his spirit grew sad the point cannot know which was right he thought they
 be proven of course but the possibility ought to call a council among themselves and that then he would go
 with is there incidentally the presence of a them all three but that until they son in law in broken
 arm s tent at the time agreed he would wait of kane s visit gives some indication of these words
 deserve careful reading his age they are not the words of one unwilling a fourth source of information can be
 to believe but are rather the discerning found in sir george simpson s writings observations of a sympathetic thinker he
 where reference is made to a bras croche did not reject what they were teaching he or crooked arm according
 to simpregretted that they disagreed he concluded son bras croche guided a party of red by saying that he would
 go with them all river emigrants from bow river across the three but that until they agreed he would rockies
 to the pacific coast in 184 l wait simpson did not state that he actually met broken arm went on
 to tell of a tradition bras croche and the story on the pacific in his tribe about white man s
 heaven here coast is couched in terms which suggest one wonders if the crees in 1848 had heard that he
 did not enough about the white man s heaven to after the arrival of the emigrants from have a tradition
 about it but this is kane s red river their guide a cree of the account name of bras croche
 took a short trip in the beaver when asked what he there was a tradition in his tribe thought of
 her don t ask me was of one of them having become a chris his reply i cannot speak my
 friends tian and was very good and did all will say that i tell lies when i let them 16
 artist paul kane painted this view of fort edmonton in 1848 the same year he met and described maskipiton however
 as his late evening visit with the cree chief was brief kane did not paint a portrait of him know
 what i have seen indians are people his request that he be given a cerfools and know nothing i can
 see that tificate is the action of a man who has the iron machinery makes the ship to go but
 i cannot see what makes the known what it was like to be called a liar iron machinery itself to
 go bras when he was simply telling the truth croche though very intelligent and palliser s journals is the fifth
 set of relike all the crees partially civilized was nevertheless so full of doubt and ferences which are of interest
 in this study wonder that he would not leave the they contain a number of entries concernvessel till he got

 presence of indians preparing to steal could be described as an exception to the the expedition s horses by noticing
 their generality of indians as he sometimes huntsignals whichhe said resembled the chirp ed in the cypress hills he would

 that he had eyes in the back of user expedition was travelling his head another strong point was his the
 presence of another peacemaker familiarity with the eagle hills country 25 on the prairies does not detract from mas tf
 maskipiton had made the acquaintance kipiton s stature it simply indicates that of the rev mr hunter as he told
 paul it cannot be proved that nichiwa and kane he most likely knew the route from maskipiton are the same
 person the eagle hills past canton house and similarly one cannot conclusively prove north east to cumbenland house 3 on
 the basis of existing evidence either that but there is a question about nichiwa s there were two maskipitons one

 arrived in canada in august of 1900 she was accompanied by her mother her stepfather dmytro kowaliuk and five other
 children her family was part of a contingent of immigrants from bukowina one of the ukrainian provinces then under austria
 who came to canada in search of land upon the immigrants arrival in winni peg they were met by immigration
 agent cyril genik who advised the newcomers to go to alberta they were told that there still was a lot
 of good homesteads there while in manitoba the best honiestead land ‘ had been picked over by earlier settlers ‘
 ‘ ‘ ‘ but dmytro kowaliuk like many of his countrymen preferred to locate near his ‘ own kinfolk his
 brother ivan and his step ‘ 4 son wasyl roshko had preceded him to ‘ canada in 1897 and both
 were homestead j mg in the emerson gardenton area ignor ing genik s advice dmytro and three other families boarded
 the train heading for southem manitoba they arrived in dominion city and quite by chance met wasyl who had come
 in for supplies he took the kowaliuk family home with him i o at the roshko farm two other families
 a already were sharing the small hut and no matter how willing the host may have it wasn t easy
 to find a good homestead been to put up another eight people it the surrounding area was part of the
 red was mandatory for the kowaliuks to find river basin with much cf it being marshother shelter three days later
 they moved land and unfit for cultivation finally in in with brother ivan and his family six july of 1901
 dmytro settled on a homeweeks later when roshko s other guests stead five miles from roshko s place the moved
 out dmytro and his family went family had to blaze a trail between the two to stay with him remaining
 there until the homes circling around swamps and keepfollowing year ing to higher ground where possible here while dmytro went
 out to work to earn they built a log shack on some higher money for basic necessities the remainder of
 the family helped around roshko s place in return for board and shelter they clear mrs woywitka a resident of
 edmonton has been a frequent contributor to eu land put up hay picked berries and alberta history with articles on

 after their marold wagon and a plough 20 ground they daubed it with clay and made mother and children were
 left in charge a thatched roof of slough hay the window with their nearest neighbour being miles opening and door
 had to be covered with away but there was no time to brood about handy scraps as there was no
 money left the isolation for there was too much work over they made a clay bakeoven and used to be
 done more land had to be cleared an open fire to cook their meals the fans and hay had to
 be cut by scythe for winter ily also planted a garden nearby and moved fodder the older children helped the
 mothin er while domka dominka who was eight the kowaliuk homestead and surround years old was left in complete charge

 province the citizens of strathcona the town on the opposite side of the river from edmonton had been much exercised
 over the fact that no official reception had been arranged for the governor general and party who were to reach
 the town on the afternoon preceding the inaugural day through some oversight no one had been commissioned to prepare an
 address to his excellency or arrange the other necessary details of the receptive function so it happened that the hour
 came for the arrival of the vice regal train and found nothing done toward a reception and the mayor the
 town council and leading citizens all blaming one another for the delinquency there was of course a large crowd of
 curious spectators on the platform when the train drew up at the station among the crowd was an individual known
 locally as jeremiah the poet now jeremiah was addicted to strong drink as well as to poetry and when under
 the influence of the former was much given to improvising the latter when sir wilfrid laurier alighted on the platform
 he came leisurely along bowing to the crowd and smiling in his friendly way jeremiah having many times seen the
 premier s picture was not too intoxicated to recognize the original with his head bared he made straight for sir
 wilfrid and seizing him by the hand proceeded with sundry poetical effusions to pour out to him an address of
 welcome which if not as classic in form as the one the mayor should have presented to the governor general
 at least amounted to much the same thing in substance the citizens who had gathered on the platform were much
 mortified and there were cries of take him away and arrest him whereupon jeremiah turned and exclaimed dramatically no no
 you shall not arrest hini he is the premier of this great dominion and i hic welcome him to this
 town sir gilbert parker and some other members of the vice regal party who witnessed the incident from the car
 platform burst into a great laugh in which sir wilfrid heartily joined calgary herald oct 3 1907 24 notes and
