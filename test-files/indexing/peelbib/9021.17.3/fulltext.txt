 sarcee grub dance calgary the past week this town has been the theatre for a number of pow wows on
 thursday afternoon a few of the sarcees assembled in the yard of i g baker co and gave an exhibition
 or technically speaking a grub dance some of the performers were decked out with natures gorgeous apparel with the addition
 of a breech cloth and others were clothed in the highest style of indian ingenuity the braves form a circle
 in the centre of which are seated the chief musicians who assidiously keep up a discordant monotonous tumtum tum on
 a drum after a time those in the outer circle become possessed with the desire to dance and then commences
 what to a casual observer look more like the antics of insanity than the doings of rational beings after tiring
 of the mazy whirl a brief cessation is had when some brave will relate to the admiring crowd some exploit
 of years gone by probably the stealing of a white man s horse or the scalping of a blackfoot that
 these recitals of personal bravery are satisfactorily received is evidenced by numerous grunts from the crowd and pounding the drum
 by the musicians a peculiar feature of the dance is the absence of the fair ones of the tribe except
 as spectators in scenes of festivity the squaws must keep without the charmed circle the indian woman is of no
 account unless there is hard work to be done then the lords of creation give their orders and await their
 fulfilment it is the occurrence of every day life to see a stalwart indian walk along the streets unencumbered with
 any burden save his blanket while his squaw will have swung over her shoulders a papoose flour wood and almost
 countless other articles as mr indian passes if he understands english his ears will tingle with how straightl see his
 majestic stride the mystery would be if they were not straight and majestic when it is remembered that they never
 crook their backs with labour calgary herald oct 1 1884 9 writing local history by hartwell bowsfield this paper is
 not designed to survey critically the field of published works in local history in western canada much fine work and
 much very bad work has been done in all provinces but no attempt will be made to give other than
 a general critique and specific references for illustrative purposes a local history will be considered as a work dealing with
 an area less than that covered by a provincial history despite any inference that local history is limited to the
 history of a town city or municipality the intention is much broader and should be thought of as covering also
 geographic and economic regions an industry a particular aspect of business or agricultural development social educational and recreational institutions local
 history and regional studies economic hinterlands in what way is should not be dismissed casually as the the development of
 the north changing mere reflection of provincial or national the economic base and outlook of these events undoubtedly the statement
 that cities smaller centres should be placed there is no such thing as a national under similar inquiry could we
 not policy would remain long unchallenged have regional studies of the movement immediately such subjects as the tariff from rural
 areas to urban and metrothe railway or westward expansion politan centres or an investigation of would come to mind to
 overstate a case local attitudes toward provincial and could it not be argued that politics is national issues far too
 often we read the art of the possible and the possible merely of generalizations such as the is based on
 expected support for a policy west thinks western canadian opinin local and regional attitudes are then ion is or the
 south west portion of the national or provincial policies more province takes the stand what conthan regional attitudes writ large
 the stitutes such statements what is their tariff and the cpr monopoly may not origin and basis regionally what was
 have reflected western attitudes but the local debate if any on the issue were possible because of regional sup under
 consideration only local investiport elsewhere gation and analysis can provide the other themes stress the northern answer local and regional
 examination will character of canada or focus on metropolitanism the latter seeing canada s require an ever increasing focus on
 the development as the organization of geographic setting the historical backeconomic social and cultural hinterlands ground and economic development of
 each theme should now be subjected the centres within the region and as a to further deeper probing through a
 wider range of research material beseries of sectional and regional investi comes available in libraries and archives gations studies might
 be undertaken in this type of study becomes feasible western canada to inquire into such only on a better understanding
 and matters as the north south relationships knowledge of these centres can the within the central plains area or the
 broader studies and interpretation of the british columbia american axis region be made local history is the groundwork and the
 local historian can the same might be undertaken for contribute to the work such studies may inter city rivalry and

 on the history of the canadian west in 1967 mr bowsfield was archivist for the province of manitoba he also
 was active in encouraging tire work of local history groups and of the manitoba historical society mr bowsfield now is
 working towards his doctorate at university of toronto 111 themes or may be of value in revising limited period of
 time very often the existing interpretation of national and choice of an area for investigation has provincial history the struggle
 between more significance as a geographic or canada and the united states for the economic unit than the poltical unit
 such north west which reached its climax at as the rural municipality the time of the red river disturbances how
 do you do the history of a in 1870 is always dealt with at the square on the map local
 history writers level of international relations john a are guilty of listing firsts or isolated macdonald usually is credited with
 out incidents and neglecting the fact that manoeuvring the americans and holding history is the story of growth and transthe
 west for britain it would be almost formation local history will gain no un canadian to take away any credit
 recognition as long as local historians from john a but should he be more than think of history as merely
 something partially credited have we had a study someone in the community can rememof the religious and educational institu ber
