 premature victory over the flu his backache reddening and running of the authority was challenged and his lack of eyes
 pains and aches all over the body and power exposed general prostration this sounded not un imposition of quarantine was
 the first like the grippe and ordinary influenza and most obvious step to be taken and in calgary doctors hoped
 they were faced with doing so mahood broke the jaw the however the 1918 19 flu had some alberta health
 act did not provide for special added features one was its extreme the quarantine of influenza cases mahood contagiosity present

 placarded some failed 10 act because they were convinced that other doctors were not obeying regulations or that such measures
 did no good there was also a genuine sympathy for a family that could be cut off from the outside
 world and from its source of income for a set of symptoms 4 that in ordinary times would interest practically
 no one at any rate quarantine was never more than partially successful against the spread of the flu it has
 been estimated 1 that despite the best efforts of the health department of edmonton the number of cases reported and
 quarantined in that city did not exceed 60 percent of the actual cases in the community if one believed the

 by this the obvious being that many men were nov 1 st perhaps the worst epidemic of overseas with the
 army and the regular the province they helped at the sarcee employment of the rest was enforced by reserve where
 practically all teachers and the loafer act but another reason pupils were taken sick and after city inexisted the epidemic

 war and a problem many of calgary s health perfor civilization nursing was considered a sonnel went to towns north

 definite idea new legislation niade it a criminal offence in his mind of bringing about the down to smoke opium

 secondly the parameters in the hands of his superiors he may of the act were widened so as to include
 24 cocaine morphine and eucaine the illegal possession and trading of these drugs were also subject to the imprisonment and
 or fines lastly all offences under the expand ed opium and drug act were seen to be summary convictions but
 by neglecting to enact effective legislation against the use of opiate based nostrums and patent mcdi cines the canadian government
 did not allay the problem of the middle class addict population s while the federal government was re peatedly subject
