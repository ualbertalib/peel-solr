 the patrician 1992 1 colonel in chief princess patricia s canadian light infantry the countess mountbatten of burma cbe cd 
 jp dl message from the colonel in chief the year 1992 produced many challenges for the canadian forces in general 
 and our regiment in particular reorganisation of any kind is never a comfortable process however necessary and the changes affecting 
 our third battalion are very fundamental not only in the composition of the battalion but even in a proposed re 
 siting of the headquarters onto the mainland for reasons of access at the same time as these fundamental changes are 
 in the pipeline we have been tasked with the vital work of supporting the united national peacekeeping forces in croatia 
 and somalia there can hardly be a more important peacetime undertaking with all its difficult situations and being the focus 
 for the eyes of the world these challenges affect our whole regiment in one way or another and it is 
 really good to know as i do indeed that every patricia is superbly trained and able to rise to whatever 
 occasion is required of him or her i well realise it is a particularly difficult time for families to face 
 all these changes but i also know how marvellously supportive and adaptable they are indeed we could not do the 
 excellent work we do as a regiment without the wholehearted support of the regimental family i feel very proud to 
 be part of my patricias as your colonel in chief

 cd message from the colonel of the regiment the year just completed has been a challenging one for all facets 
 of the regiment certainly it could not have been busier with the many training events and taskings that have arisen 
 or are continuing throughout the dedication and performance of all patricias has been exemplary travels during 1992 have brought me 
 into contact with all components of the regimental family including the loyal edmonton regiment now that the total army concept 
 is moving into implementation we are seeing increasing evidence of regular reserve integration this will continue to be the norm 
 and the challenge our approach to service must recognize this fact and take into account the changing face of the 
 regiment as we move forward heritage activities have been given a boost by the installation of our founder s statue 
 in confederation square in ottawa further progress on the patricia gallery in the museum of the regiments in calgary is 
 accelerating through the generosity and efforts of both serving and retired members showcasing our traditions of loyalty and service gives 
 confidence in our future united nations taskings are both increasing in number and becoming more complex with third battalion in 
 croatia and second airborne commando in somalia plus the expected assignment of second battalion to replace the third we as 
 a regiment are really stuck into it with upcoming changes in manning levels demands on individuals will grow and once 
 again we ll rely on our most precious asset the soldier to get us through reflecting on the many events 
 affecting the patricias and the many places and groups that i ve visited i remain impressed by our people this 
 applies to the association as well as the serving soldiers competence professionalism and energy remain high concern comradeship and co 
 operation are most evident and are positively focused on behalf of my wife marianne and myself i thank all of 
 you for the many courtesies extended assistance given and events enjoyed the next few years look full of opportunities and 
 satisfaction to each of you and to your loved ones go our appreciation for the work done and the sacrifices 
 made for the sake of the regiment to this we add our very best wishes for the future and the 
 hope that we will meet wherever you are serving canada s interests

 the patrician 1992 5 message from the national president princess patricia s canadian light infantry association d arcy j best 
 cd too many of today s serving soldiers think the ppcli association is a bunch of old guys who show 
 up for troopings and other regimental occasions gather in the messes and talk about wars which took place before most 
 of today s soldiers were born this is only partially true our members are drawn to the association by the 
 bonds of comradeship and esprit de corps forged by service in the regiment in war and peace but it should 
 not be looked upon as merely an old comrades association the association although it is an independent component within the 
 regimental family serves both the regiment and its retired members as we are the legal guardians of regimental property and 
 funds much of our activity and administration is linked to the regiment the national president represents the association at meetings 
 0:meet 0:ings of the regimental guard and the regimental executive committee providing association input in the development and management of 
 regimental affairs as an example the decision to celebrate san fortunato day was made on recommendation by the association the 
 president and vice president of the association are chairman and vice chairman of the board of trustees of the hamilton 
 gault memorial fund and together with immediate past president and secretary treasurer comprise a majority on the board the association 
 also provides the chairman and a majority of the members of the newly formed regimental heritage committee the hall of 
 honour in the regimental museum was conceived and carried to completion by rod middleton president of the association from 1984 
 until 1989 and for the most part paid for with funds raised by association branches members of the calgary branch 
 serve as volunteers in the museum and assist in the annual cash casino which in 1992 raised 32 000 00 
 for the museum fund the okanagan thompson branch have constructed a small park and erected a memorial cairn at vernon 
 camp to perpetuate the memory of patricia s who have served there members of the ottawa branch played a key 
 role in acquiring the hamilton gault statue for that city and provided a colour party at the unveiling recently a 
 group of winnipeg members have formed a telephone fan out system under the direction of the second battalion s welfare 
 officer and a cfb winnipeg social worker while the battalion is away on operational duties this group will be available 
 when necessary to forward important information 0:informa 0:tion to the dependents at home thereby reducing morale problems by forestalling rumoursand 
 clarifying misinformation provided by the news media these are just a few examples of what the association can do we 
 have taken off our uniforms but we are still patricia s and many of us welcome any opportunity to be 
 of further service to our regiment as our field units face increasing commitments with fewer people the association must do 
 everything possible to assist and free up serving soldiers for their primary military duties unit officers should look upon the 
 association as a resource and work with their local branch executives to find ways in which this resource can be 
 used to best advantage always a patricia 
 6 the patrician 1992 ppcli association all patricias are encouraged to become members of the association either as local branch 
 members or as members at large serving members are more than welcome to join while still serving in the regiment

 the patrician 1992 13 first battalion princess patricia s canadian light infantry for all ranks of the first and finest 
 1992 came and went in much the same fashion as years past and that expected for years to come a 
 blur on returning from christmas leave the battalion got straight into preparations for exercise nordic defender 1992 the brigade winter 
 exercise started in the sarcee training area and then moved out to mclean creek for several days to conduct the 
 remainder of the exercise nordic defender also involved 1 service battalion 408 tactical helicopter squadron from edmonton and the ldsh 
 rc who acted as enemy force it proved to be a hard slog for the rifle companies the exercrise ended 
 with b company caught in the middle of a 15km death march over a particularly unforgiving feature april saw the 
 first battalion deploy to wainwright for a ten day work up prior to the start of exercise rendezvous 92 itself 
 with a deployment to norway scheduled later in the year to exercise 1 ppcli as part of the nato composite 
 force it was decided that the first battalion would act as umpires during ry the ten day training period was 
 used to make up for some of the training which was to be missed as a result of the umpire 
 tasking it saw the companies conducting section and platoon refresher training in the sub zero wastelands of red brown black 
 and blue routes and the badlands themselves with more than a few lessons being learned by all involved decision making 
 and delegation of tasks were practiced at all levels each morning when it was time to decide who was to 
 be the first to leave the warmth of their sleeping bag to turn up the herman nelson heater and turn 
 the lights back on see guys if we just clamp these together it should work ok for some strange reason 
 the ten day deployment was compensated for by ten days of leave it provided battalion personnel with an opportunity to 
 spend some quality time with their significant others before we returned to wainwright when we did return it was as 
 part of the first gathering of 1 canadian division in a long time an ambitious exercise which would eventually see 
 the armies of the east and west face off in exercise royal prairie the last exercise to be conducted during 
 ry 92 before exercise royal prairie could happen there was a lot of training and preparation to be done 1 
 ppcli conducted a battalion exercise with the rifle companies exercising against each other while elements of ldsh rc supported the 
 side on the offense as with all exercises many valuable lessons ere before exercise royal prairie could happen there was 
 a lot of training and preparation to be done learned the most memorable this time happened when a river crossing 
 was to be executed the first crossing of the mighty battle river no doubt the patrol members arrived at battalion 
 headquarters ready to link up with the engineers who were to accompany them to do the assessment of the river 
 for the upcoming crossing two hours and much coffee later the patrol members were still waiting and finally went on 
 their patrols with an engineer officer who had nothing to do with the exercise but had come to battalion hq 
 to discuss other matters it s probably the last time he ll show up unannounced during an exercise so lieutenant 
 colonel pentney why are you dressed in green when the rest of your soldiers are in white 
 the patrician 1992 14 sgt wiebe thinking that no one can see him with the end of the first battalion 
 training it was time to shift into the umpire mode before this could happen however exercise prairie charge a live 
 fire combat team attack exercise was organised and run by 1 ppcli with help from other units under the command 
 of the deputy commanding officer major mike austdal the scenario saw the mortar platoons from the appropriate battalions firing live 
 in support of each of the participating sub units conducting the attack during one such attack sgt davis acting as 
 a mortar line safety nco noticed that one mortar tube was facing the wrong direction and immediately gave the order 
 to stop firing for his prompt action which averted a potentially fatal accident sgt davis was awarded the brigade commander 
 s commendation the end of exercise prairie charge marked the end of a very demanding period for a large part 
 of 1 ppcli it meant that the daily adreps for medical supplies to relieve the constant headaches suffered by major 
 austdal and his staff would come to an end it also meant that the umpire tasking was about to begin 
 while prairie charge had been winding down major joe pollock had been preparing his notes for two days of intense 
 lectures on the finer points of umpiring at the same time reinforcements were arriving in the 1 ppcli bivouac site 
 to fill the end of exercise prairie charge marked the end of a very demanding period for a large part 
 of 1 ppcli the ranks of the umpire organization sparing no expense a group of officers and senior nco s 
 was brought in from new zealand they brought with them much experience some good stories and a rugby ball it 
 is hard to say which asset was used more during their stay with 1 ppcli though rsm spring has had 
 plenty of use for the taiaha a ceremonial club which they left behind as a gift to the battalion following 
 the expert instruction provided by major pollock and others with experience on the subject the umpire tasking proved to be 
 fairly straight forward there were few discrepancies 0:discrepan 0:cies between umpires from opposing brigades as to the outcome of a 
 contact there was almost no problem communicating 0:commu 0:nicating results up the umpire chain of command most significantly though both 
 sides were meticulous in their observation of casualties assessed by the umpires on hand padres pellerin and fletcher and the

 the patrician 1992 15 and then just as quickly as it had started it was over suddenly all the creature 
 comforts started to disappear as things were packed for the trip home after a brief wait for the buses and 
 a warning to check the boxlunch sandwiches before eating them it was time to make the trip back to calgary 
 only the families and friends were happier than the city itself to see the battalion come home after almost two 
 months away when the usual post exercise drills had been completed and the upcoming leave was firmly in the minds 
 of most suddenly from out of the blue there came a fastball the battalion had been tasked to provide a 
 150 man guard to be part of the grandstand show at the calgary stampede by a stroke of luck the 
 company sergeants major were able to find just enough volunteers who neither wanted to go on leave or go to 
 the stampede and who were more than willing to give of their time lieutenant colonel pentney practising for an upcoming 
 parade during ry 92 recce platoon being environmentally friendly with drip pans under their vehicles on returning from leave it 
 was time to wrap up preparations 0:prepara 0:tions for the battalion deployment to norway as part of canada s contribution 
 to the nato composite force battalion group fortunately for those who say it often this title is abbreviated to ncf 
 battalion group the battalion group is a self sufficient organization which consists of elements of 1 service battalion 408 squadron 
 1 combat engineer regiment royal canadian horse artillery and airdefense provided by the regiment d artillerie legere canadien this year

 the patrician 1992 16 following a modest struggle with the air force to give us a ride to the exercise 
 the battalion group started to deploy at the end of august before deploying however there was some training to be 
 done this included a week long basic mountain operations course run by a company and was intended to prepare everyone 
 for the rigours of operating in mountainous terrain while providing some very valuable training the basic mountain course also has 
 a history of being quite popular with participants providing the opportunity to practice such skills as rappelling basicclimbingand mountain walkingin 
 the rockies our time in norway was an experience from start to finish the boeing 747 which was chartered to 
 get the battalion group over there in time was so heavily loaded with people it was quickly discovered that horror 
 stories about prices in norway are not exaggerated at all and equipment that it rolled as far north as red 
 deer before finally becoming airborne arriving on a friday there was little option but to go to the mess of 
 a nearby norwegian unit where it was quickly discovered that horror stories about prices in norway are not exaggerated at 
 all it cost the equivalent of twenty dollars for four beers and that was the mess price it was considerably 
 more expensive at the carma the only civilian wake him up and we ll kill you bar discotheque near our 
 location people soon learned to be careful when buying food or drink training started quickly with the rifle companies practicing 
 their shooting on some of the local ranges it was a culture shock to find that the accepted safety standards

 the patrician 1992 17 at the same time all of the elements of battalion hq were linking up with their 
 counterparts at brigade north hq in an effort to prepare for the exercise the norwegian military was very helpful not 
 only in answering questions and helping to arrange training but also in acting as go betweens between ourselves and many 
 of the civilians we came into contact with more than once it was necessary for them to talk to an 
 irate farmer who was upset because someone had crossed his property while training perhaps it should be mentioned for the 
 benefit of readers that norway does not have training areas such as wainwright suffield shilo etc as we do in 
 canada in norway exercises are conducted on civilian land as required when it was finally time to redeploy home the 
 no go trace of places to avoid had become quite large following the initial company training a patrol exercise was 
 held requiring each rifle company to conduct a fighting patrol against a mortar base plate position unfortunately for charlie company 
 who were the first to go the enemy force did not display any of the expected characteristics of a mortar 
 base plate position in action most notably loud noises when the what do you mean they re coming the other 
 ivay bombs are fired from the tubes in fact the enemy was very quiet with the result that c company 
 had to try to find small silent groups of people in the dark in unfamiliar territory the end result was 
 that they came home cold tired and angry for subsequent patrols the enemy force made more noise w o anderson

 the patrician 1992 18 during exercise barfrost we were fortunate to be given a large part of the action by 
 brigade north 1 ppcli was the lead unit in an advance north up a valley bordered by mountains which were 
 steep and high as the soldiers who had to walk up and down them will testify the weather was particularly 
 unforgiving especially at night and as it was almost exclusively a dismounted exercise it proved to be particularly challenging for 
 all despite the challenges provided by the terrain the battalion performed very well and advanced quickly later on we were 
 tasked to conduct a relief in place with a norwegian armoured unit we discovered to our horror that in conducting 
 their advance the armoured unit had bypassed an enemy company strength position without realising it we encountered 0:encoun 0:tered this 
 position in moving to do the relief in place needless to say it caused us a few problems and delayed 
 the relief a little sgt markwart and his section during c company s airmobile the other item that will be 
 remembered from our visit to norway for a long time is the hair cuts which some of the norwegian soldiers 
 had or more accurately did not have as a result of being in a conscript army they are allowed to 
 grow their hair as long as they want and many of them do this was quite a change from the 
 short back and sides to which we are accustomed it was interesting to note that the norwegian officers had shorter 
 hair than the soldiers whereas in canada it is usually the other way around while the better part of 1 
 ppcli was participating in exercise barfrost a small but distinguished group was representing 0:repre 0:senting the battalion and canada in 
 the northern european command infantry competition necic they had trained very hard since the summer when the battalion was in 
 wainwright and when they deployed to norway for the competition they were all in excellent shape and very well prepared

 20 the patrician 1992 mcpl howard feeling grateful that the situation isn t reversed lt stu smoley wondering if doing 
 basic mountain school with 1 ppcli was such a good idea after all late in september both the 1 ppcli 
 battalion group and the necic team returned home the usual post exercise drills were completed in record time as most 
 of the equipment and vehicles were coming back by surface mail sea and the majority of the unit went on 
 a weeks leave to re establish ties with loved ones as is usually the case some continued to work putting 
 the finishing touches on exercise metal pike an internal security exercise which was to involve both the rcmp and calgary 
 police service the exercise represented the first time the three agencies have worked together in a long time and proved 
 to be a constant process of learning and adjusting to the methods of others should it ever be necessary for 
 the three services to work together in a real situation the true value of the training will be apparent padre

 the patrician 1992 21 mcpl sutherland determined to show that he can do it better his way immediately following exercise 
 metal pike the battalion launched into a primary combat function course cycle the courses ran right up until christmas and 
 would include yet another deployment to wainwright before everyone could go to wainwright however the french grey cup was held 
 this annual event marks the end of the fall sports cycle and the final games are played in soccer floor 
 hockey and of course football more importantly perhaps there is also the parade of company floats to decide the french 
 grey cup queen and winning float this year the queen was pte thompson of a company while c company entered 
 the winning float in the football game that followed b company defeated combat support in a close fought game which 
 nearly went into overtime the pain of defeat for combat support was eased by an earlier victory in the soccer 
 game while c company was victorious in floor hockey at the end of november while the majority of the battalion 
 was in wainwright finishing their pcf courses the battalion hq and attachments participated in exercise poison dart a command post 
 exercise which allows the battalion hq to be trained without making the soldiers endure the usual freezing and walking this 
 year the exercise was highlighted by an international soccer game which was held on the afternoon of sunday 29 november

 29 the patrician 1992 a company a company has spent much of 1992 on the road actually most of it 
 off road the last week of january found the company on a winter exercise at shilo joined by the cameron 
 highlanders then switching snowshoes for bangy boards the company stayed in the snow for a week of ski school the 
 highlight of this was a day of downhill skiing at holiday mountain which is actually a valley only in manitoba 
 eh moving back to winnipeg long enough to re pack the rucksack for summer only the army packs for summer 
 ops in march and to load the tracks onto rail cars a company went west to sunny suffield two weeks 
 of intensive field firing and mechanized operations were enjoyed by all the weather cooperated with alberta dust being preferable to 
 manitoba snow anytime dropping the apcs off at wainwright we again enjoyed a quick visit to winnipeg before deploying in 
 april to join the rest of the army at rv92 july saw a change in the management with the oc 
 maj matt overton 2ic capt scott macdonald and csm mcardle leaving the company maj john mccomber capt kirn murphy and 
 mwo ron cameron assumed command almost immediately the company was op tasked to 1 ppcli in support of a nato 
 combined forced deployment a benefit of this was the opportunity to attend that battalion s mountain school at kananaskis in 
 early august the excellent training and the beautiful scenery was a highpoint in the year rappelling off the yam in 
 the late morning by nightfall the company had gone from the rocky mountains to the sandy hills of wainwright to 
 participate in ex western chal pcf courses followed a company conducted the driver tracked course at shilo with a number 
 of candidates from 1 ppcli who were under the misapprehension that a by 206 was a real track in this 
 battalion it is considered a recreational vehicle the year closed for a company where it began in the snow this

 30 the patrician 1992 b company b company s year was a challenging and a rewarding one especially due to 
 the fact we were able at long last to leave the confines of garrison behind us in march the company 
 deployed to coppermine nwt for a sovereignty exercise the company split into its three platoons and these with inuit rangers 
 for guides set off to explore the vastness of the arctic according to many it was a constant battle to 
 remain onboard the komatiks as the snowmobiles bombed across the ice at full throttle during the time spent out on 
 the land the company sampled many of the treats of the far north including raw caribou raw arctic char and 
 musk ox not raw thank god the exercise ended with each platoon leaving a legacy to its exploits as all 
 three built rock cairns to remain behind soon after our arctic adventure the company along with the battalion deployed to 
 wainwright for rv92 five weeks of fun and games in the training area followed to many the highlights were the 
 three airmobile operations that the company 0:com 0:pany participated in including one intrusion behind enemy lines during the divisional exercise

 provided an excellent base to warm up relax and prepare for the next day the wednesday of each week was 
 utilized by the coy comds to practice a fairly long 20 km march on skis and practice tactical movement and 
 march discipline the fourth day the troops then bussed a couple hours south to holiday mountain for a day of 
 downhill skiing well they call them mountains here all right i m not making this up the last day was 
 spent on clean up and returning to winnipeg this well structured progressive concept saw a c cbt sp and a 
 good portion of adm company get a chance to practice and improve on their ability to move operate and fight 
 on skis b company was up in coppermine nwt so we let them skip out the ability to overcome the 
 obstacles created by winter and snow are imperative to canadian soldiers skiing is one method that allows us to do

 october to 13 november 1992 overcoming great adversity due to multiple tasks and shrinking manpower resources course preparations commenced upon 
 the battalion s return in late august from ex western challenge in wainwright alberta these preparations became more challenging when 
 c company was tasked to augment 3 ppcli on op harmony in yugoslavia and a company was tasked to augment 
 1 ppcli on its amf l task in norway these two tasks severely limited the availability of instructors and candidates 
 it was decided courses would be run only where there existed a serious deficiency in qualified personnel these included basic

 tow gunner and assault pioneer courses were not run as enough qualified personnel already existed to meet the battalion s 
 needs most of the courses bega non october 5 the only exception was the track course which did not begin 
 until october 12 due to a company s absence on tasking with 1 ppcli following the normal week or two 
 of the weapon handling drills voice procedure exercises and po checks the majority of the courses deployed to cfb shilo 
 to conduct the practical portions of their training the deployment as in years past seemed to coincide perfectly with manitoba 
 s first winter storm resulting in a few minor vehicle mishaps thankfully no one was hurt the basic communicator course 
 was able to satisfy its field requirements by deploying to st charles range just outside winnipeg thereby avoiding the driving 
 hazards the highlight of the field training for the machine gun and is that what s his name from recce

 that got outside of themselves and approached the march with enthusiasm and a light hearted attitude seemed to have an

 farmland in the west to heavily forested hills in the east the basic tasks of the battalion include manning permanent 
 vehicle checkpoints referred to as wcs manning mobile checkpoints and patrolling both mounted and dismounted the main purpose behind these

 support group and a small portion of the canadian contingent headquarters the first half of our tour has had more 
 than its share of excitement we have faced everything from ambushes to rabid dogs through all of these incidents the 
 soldiers of the battalion have done themselves and their regiment proud we have also conducted a number of cordon and 
 search operations against both civilian houses and police stations these ops have netted a wide variety of hardware ranging from 
 ammunition and rifles to 30 1 4 pound blocks of plastic explosives our mobile checkpoints have also been very successful 
 capturing everything 0:every 0:thing from mortar rounds to three sa 7 grail missiles one of the activities that occupies most 
 of the troops time off is accommodation renovations this is one area where the battalion has proven that canadians really 
 are the best in the world at doing more with less among the projects we have undertaken are the re 
 roofing of the pakrac hotel something ce said would cost 140 000 but which c coy accomplished for about 40 
 000 we have also dumped enough gravel to fill victoria harbour into the various mudholes around the area but guess 
 what we re still up to our knees in mud three of the major incidents from the first half of 
 our tour are described briefly in the following paragraphs there have been many other incidents of note during our time 
 here both humorous and sad from soldiers falling into septic tanks to grenades being thrown at checkpoints i feel that 
 these three will give a good indication of what life can be like in the former yugoslavia and drive home

 third in the early hours of 26 oct d company and recce platoon were dispatched to the stara gradiska bridge

 valuable commodity we had to offer recce pulled up to the bridge at 0450 hrs with five apcs and blocked 
 it off as they constructed a barricade bursts of automatic weapon fire went right past them from both sides of

 the patrician 1992 81 fall regimental day 21 september the battle of san fortunato by nightfall on september 18th the 
 steady pressure and dour courage of the canadian infantry had turned the tide the outflanking movement had made the san 
 martino untenable with the patricias and their comrades on the line of the railway only a narrow corridor of escape 
 remained to the garrison of the pillboxes as for the ausa which lay beside the railway a broad jumper could 
 cross it dry shod but because of its steep muddy banks it remained an obstacle to tanks that evening anti 
 tank and medium machine guns came up and began to deal with the last remnants of the enemy on the 
 opposite side of the stream before dawn a company was holding the south bank and work on a bridge had 
 begun all three canadian brigades now were in the firing line 48th highlanders of canada had taken over on the 
 right of the patricias the days fighting had cost the battalion 67 casualties but only seven had been fatal the 
 stage was now set for the final san fortunato assault on the evening of september 19th the attack opened with 
 saturation shoots of terrifying intensity under the control of intricate trace sheets eighth army artillery units became instruments 0:instru 0:ments

 with unending torrents of high explosive and steel such w as the accuracy of the fire programme that amidst its 
 blasts the infiltrating canadian infantry moved forward along protected corridors and closed on the demoralized defenders the seaforths won the 
 eastern end of san fortunato and swung to the right towards rimini the loyal edmontons scrambled up the steep slopes 
 of the southern approaches and made their way to san lorenzo on a spur to the rear of the main 
 feature men of the royal 22e regiment their blood up at their rough treatment surged swiftly over the southwest extremity 
 of the high ground and destroyed the defiant german garrisons attempts to counter attack broke down by first light san 
 fortunato was secure and the way to the marecchia was open at 0830 hours on september 20th the patricia rifle 
 companies 0:compa 0:nies deployed on a start line 1 000 yards beyond the ausa a reconnaissance in detail by capt 
 e d mcphail had led to the selection of a series of intermediate objectives and firm bases on the line 
 of advance to the marecchia on the first high ground beyond the village of san fortunato were bovey and moire 
 which in effect were jump off positions for the push to the river at moire a church and a cemetery 
 provided conspicuous landmarks the reserve company of the loyal edm ntons held this area a thousand yards ahead nylon was 
 elected as the first patricia fire base a thousand yards beyond nylon on the long slope down to the marecchia 
 pique was chosen as the forward position from which the companies would deploy for the crossing 1 500 yards beyond 
 pique across a succession of vineyards and orchards lay the broad river bed and narrow twisty channels of the marecchia 
 at 1400 hours b and c companies advanced an hour later they reported in from moire but without their tanks 
 and anti tank guns which had failed to negotiate the steep and greasy slopes of the san fortunato feature here 
 the company commanders were warned that enemy groups including tanks had been detected around nylon at 1600 hours when a 
 and d companies moved tip to bovey capt j r koensgen and his medium machine gunners thrust on ahead and 
 contacted enemy forces which they engaged and scattered by long range high angle fire a patricia carrier was destroyed by 
 a direct hit in this action

 reached a bold decision he decided to by pass nylon and to continue to pique on the lower ground hewasconfidentthattheoperation 
 had reached a stage when enemies in the rear should not be allow ed to interfere unduly with its culmination 
 the orders to by pass nylon were issued at 2030 hours but did not reach b and c companies at 
 moire until after midnight the enemy was jamming all radio transmissions at 0225 hours september 21st the two forward companies 
 advanced a short distance beyond moire lieut w g mcneil and several of his men were killed by a shell 
 and csm w h clare took over command pending the arrival of capt g r corkett who was returning to 
 the battalion for the first time since his serious wounds in north africa at 0330 hours both forward companies reported 
 in as snug at pique whereupon a company was ordered forward from bovey to lead the way toward the river 
 crossing and d company was instructed to patrol towards nylon and if possible to ascertain the strength of the enemy 
 in that area by dawn a company had reached the marecchia the crossing presented no difficulties and at 0950 hours 
 major cutbill and his men were over the river and astride the emilian way there had been a certain amount 
 of shellfire but no other opposition orders were issued immediately for the other 83 the patrician 199

 his northern flank a scouting tank from this group was discouraged by piat fire but lest a dangerous situation arise 
 two of the surviving seven tanks of b squadron 145 th royal tank regiment hurried to b companys support as 
 his company was down to 40 of all ranks major mcdougall withdrew his men across the river during the night 
 but returned before dawn next morning at celle b company was taken under command by the 22nd new zealand motor 
 battalion which had come up after rimini had fallen to the 3rd greek mountain brigade the new zealanders were in 
 the process of relieving ist canadian division and all canadian vehicles had been ordered off the main roads to make 
 room for the oncoming troops who were under orders to maintain pressure upon the retreating enemy the battle over congratulations 
 poured in it had been bitter fighting september was the most costly month of the mediterranean campaign for the canadian 
 formations the patricias had been fairly fortunate total casualties for the san fortunato operation had been three officers killed and 
 nine wounded 28 other ranks killed and 106 wounded these losses represented the cost of solid achievement rimini was the 
 hinge of the german defenses beyond the marecchia it always was possible to bring converging attacks upon the enemy from 
 west and south even on the highest levels it was believed that a turning point had been reached in the 
 grim struggle general sir oliver leese in his message to the canadian corps declared you have beaten eleven german divisions 
 and have broken into the po valley his individual message to the patricia s read the regiment may be proud 
 of its part in a great and hard fought victory well done canada further inland the battle also had gone 
 well san marino had been captured and the enemy had been flung back along the foothills of the appenines the 
 patricias therefore left the firing line with the belief shared by most of the eight army that the decisive battle 
 had been won and that the end of the italian campaign was in sight kapyong after the battle the battle 
 of kapyong has been well documented by those who took part in this gallant defence by the soldiers of 2nd 
 battalion princess patricia s canadian light infantry 24 25 april 1951 at the time of kapyong i was attached to 
 headquarters 27 commonwealth brigade as liaison officer from 2ppcli one of the duties of an lo is to visit his 
 parent unit whenever possible and on specific tasks to bring to the commanding officer the latest map overlays and orders 
 for redeployment of his battalion 0:battal 0:ion that opportunity for a visit to the battalion position on hill 677 was 
 not to be afforded me as the battalion was soon to be engaged in battle that totally cut them off 
 from any contact from outside just after first light on the morning of 26 april i was called to the 
 brigade major s operations van and advised that there would be two us army helicopters arriving in a few minutes 
 to pick me up to guide them to 2ppcli s position so that they could evacuate our seriously wounded casualties 
 who could not be evacuated by road when the chinese up to that point had the battalion cut off i 
 rechecked my map to make sure of the location of the battalion s tactical headquarters and awaited the arrival of 
 the helicopters soon the distinctive noise of the two bell 47gs could be heard and then the two choppers landed 
 at our smoke marked landing spot taking along a set of new orders and map overlays for colonel stone i 
 climbed into the right hand seat of one of the craft and off we went for the first time in 
 my life i was flying in a helicopter and hoping that i would be able to lead the two us 
 army pilots directly to a place that i had never even seen before that s what scared me not the 
 flying but the thought that maybe i wouldn t be able to find the patricias 
 the patrician 1992 85 the whole area of the battle that had taken place on hill 677 was covered in 
 haze and smoke from the bush and grass fires visibility was hampered by low cloud as well and it was 
 not until we came under fire from chinese positions north of the kapyong river that i realized we had flown 
 too far north just as the pilot banked hard to the left the patricias let off an orange smoke marker 
 which marked their location and both choppers immediately headed for it upon landing the casualties 0:casual 0:ties were quickly loaded 
 into the panniers moti nted on the skids of each of the choppers while that was taking place i handed 
 over the new orders and map traces to colonel stone made notes of the battle for the brigade commander and 
 jumped back into the helicopter the pilot cranked up the power for take off but the weight was too great 
 and he turned to me and said sorry buster you re walking back i jumped out and away they went 
 my problem now was how to get back to brigade headquarters 0:head 0:quarters to my knowledge the road was still 
 blocked by the chinese but i was soon informed that lt murray edwards had been able to bring up a 
 vehicle that morning and that the road was clear as far as he knew armed with this information i set 
 off to walk back to brigade the route down from the high ground to the road led me through the 
 re entrant where the chinese had attempted to attack tac hq the fire of the 50 calibre machine guns from 
 the battalion s mortar platoon halftrack 0:half 0:track vehicles had decimated the attackers and their bodies lay among the bullet 
 shredded scrub and small trees astride the track i kept checking the surrounding scrub expecting chinese who might have stayed 
 behind when i reached the track and road junction i was surprised by three chinese who jumped out of the 
 scrub and ran off to the remains of a hut about a hundred yards away discretion being the better thought 
 than valour i ignored them and they let me pass just then a 2 1 2 ton truck came up 
 the road the driver was looking for the ppcli he had a load of reinforcements in the back and wanted 
 to know where to take them i showed him the track and he backed the truck into the area just 
 before the troops had a chance to get out of the truck a shot rang out and one of the 
 reinforcements was wounded i pointed out the location of the chinese that i had seen to the corporal in charge 
 of the detail and he set out to introduce his newly arrived patricias to the korean war i continued on 
 my way back to brigade reported to the brigade major and made my report he informed me that the withdrawal 
 plans that i had just delivered to colonel stone were going to be changed and that i would have to 
 deliver new plans and map overlays later in the afternoon t his time i would take my jeep but would 
 be without my driver pte louis rodrigue as he was still required to help with the duties of the brigade 
 hq defence platoon i set out in the late afternoon to the patricia positions on arrival i briefed the battle 
 adjutant major gordon henderson as the battalion prepared to hand over their positions to a battalion of the ist us 
 cavalry division i was asked to take with me in my jeep some of the parachutes that had been used 
 in the resupply of the battalion and two of the bodies of patricia casualties i carefully lashed the two poncho 
 wrapped patricias in the back of my jeep and covered them with some of the parachutes i set off down 
 the same track that i had walked earlier that morning and headed south on the main road i soon joined 
 up with a long line of vehicles all moving south bumper to bumper just east of the road moving from 
 bound to bound was a company of us army tanks turrets turned to the rear and firing every so often 
 with their co axial machine guns i had no idea who or what they were shooting at but it certainly 
 added to the confusion in the approaching darkness our gaggle of vehicles was soon joined by the whole of brigade 
 headquarters and my first thought was the whereabouts 0:wherea 0:bouts of my jeep trailer until i saw it being towed 
 along behind the brigade ops van no doubt i would hear about that i was stopped later by mps who 
 put two chinese wounded pows into my jeep one in the vacant front seat and the other i made sit 
 on the hood just what i needed i drove for what seemed hours and finally was able to pull off 
 the road when i saw the brigade vehicles pull into a railroad station area i turned my pows over to 
 the brigade mp detachment who didn t really want them at that time of night as both the chinese were 
 suffering from their wounds i checked in with the brigade major who told me to get my head down for 
 a rest because he wanted me to visit the middlesex and the newly arrived king s own scottish borderers later 
 that night with new orders at this stage i began to wonder what the rest of the los were doing 
 but they had not returned yet from other tasks that they were sent on and no one knew when they 
 would return i finally caught up with my driver and we recovered the jeep trailer unloaded some of my gear 
 and then placed the two bodies beside the trailer i stretched out on my cot on the other side of 
 the trailer covered myself with my sleeping bag munched on a chocolate bar and dropped off to sleep i was 
 soon awakened by one of the defence platoon soldiers asking if i was the canadian lo and when i confirmed 
 that i was he took me to a waiting 1 4 ton jeep ambulance from the indian field ambulance that 
 provided our medical support in the brigade there an indian driver told me he had three canadian bodies and could 
 i take them please because he didn t know where to take them his unit having moved and he had 
 to get back to evacuate casualties i agreed to help him and we moved over to the area where my 
 trailer was and laid out the three casualties with the others no sooner had i closed my eyes when i 
 was awakened and told to report to the ops van there i was given new orders for the middlesex the 
 artillery and the kosbs briefed on the contents of the orders and with the new map traces i prepared to 
 seek out the two units in the middle of the night rodrigue my driver was once again snaffled for guard 
 duty so i would be off on my own again i found the middlesex with no difficulty 
 86 the patrician 1992 and was soon on my way to find the kosbs they were located in a range 
 of low hills off the beaten track and look as hard as i could i failed to find the illusive 
 track that led to their positions in despair i finally set off up what i thought was a track only 
 to discover that it was nothing more than a footpath that separated the dry rice paddy fields i only discovered 
 how narrow the path was when i felt my jeep slowly sliding out from under me and i quickly put 
 the gear shift in neutral and stepped out as the jeep did a slow roll over and landed on its 
 wheels with the motor still running i found my map board and flashlight and picked up other bits that had 
 fallen out and then having had enough of driving without benefit of headlights switched them on to see where in 
 the devil i was going i kept going north for a mile or so when i was stopped by a 
 sentry who had heard my progress and offered to guide me to the kosbs battalion command post after a trek 
 up the low hill i arrived at the unit s headquarters 0:headquar 0:ters a tent inside which i found the 
 commanding officer of the kosbs and his intelligence officer the co was hovering over a kerosene heater in an attempt 
 to ward off the chill night air bear in mind that the kosb had only arrived in the korean theatre 
 of operations a few short days ago from hong kong and the wool sweaters they wore were hardly enough protection 
 from the cold spring nights i introduced myself as the lo from brigade gave the colonel his new orders and 
 the io the map overlay asked if there were any questions and prepared to leave the colonel was furious demanded 
 to know who the hell i was what identification did i have and under whose authority these orders were being 
 issued he simply refused to believe that the written orders i had handed to him duly signed by the brigade 
 major were in fact authentic and that he was not going to move his battalion yet again from positions that 
 they had only moved into a few short hours ago despite my pleading with him he insisted that his io 
 accompany me back to brigade headquarters 0:headquar 0:ters verify that the orders were in fact bonafide and return to him 
 the io and his driver followed me on my return journey but just before we got to brigade i had 
 to take a side trip to the new zealand field regiment to drop off their orders and map traces i 
 briefed the io on how to find brigade hq which was only a few miles down the road and set 
 off to complete my rounds leaving the artillery position i soon returned to the main road on the way to 
 brigade just short of the turn off to the railroad station where brigade was located i came across an upturned 
 british land rover wheels still spinning my worst fears were confirmed when i discovered the body of the driver under 
 the vehicle and the io lying on the road in a state of shock and probably suffering from a broken 
 neck i told him i would send for help as soon as i got to brigade which i did if 
 only that colonel had believed me when i tried to explain why the orders had been changed and that they 
 were authentic reporting in to the brigade major he told me that the kosb io had been in to see 
 him and he had sent him back to his unit i told him where i had found him brigade still 
 could not make radio contact with the kosbs and i never did learn the fate of that unfortunate young man 
 on returning to my trailer i discovered that another three canadian dead had been placed alongside the others i now 
 had eight patricias in my care i put my head down once again to grab a few winks and was 
 awakened just before first light when i heard a voice from the far side of my trailer calling out stand 
 to lads shake a leg now let s get a move on stand to i raised myself from my cot 
 in time to see a sergeant attempting to raise my patricias from their eternal slumber to man defensive positions around 
 brigade hq he wasn t getting much response and had raised the poncho covering the nearest body before i could 
 yell at him to tell him that these were the dead he was attempting to contributed by rod middleton rod

 i was left with the problem of having to move my casualties with only my jeep and trailer available together 
 with rodrigue we literally commandeered the brigade ration truck a bedford 3 ton truck with its white painted interior allocated 
 specifically as a vehicle for transporting fresh rations the vehicle which was the responsibility of the brigade army service corps 
 officer or brasco as he was known was not about to be released by that officer who was vehemently denying 
 my demands that it be used to move bodies i insisted and rodrigue who was a big powerful man and 
 i started loading the bodies brasco backed off and our patricias were moved south eventually to lie with their comrades 
 in the commonwealth cemetery in pusan korea where they now lie postscript at the time of the battle of kapyong 
 the whole of the command structure of the commonwealth brigade was in a state of change two of the major 
 units of the brigade the argyle and sutherland highlanders and the middlesex regiment 0:regi 0:ment were due for rotation back 
 to hong kong as was the headquarters of the 2 7th brigade itself the neiv headquarters staff would form the

 tea in hot machine guns life in the trenches the patricia s men who fought in the trenches had one 
 thing in common none had guessed how bad it would be some arrived in their early teens others were over 
 60 some had only three weeks training some had never even seen a rifle range new officers often showed up 
 with glistening sabres freshly sharpened and were shocked to spend weeks beneath a cascade of shells a mile from the 
 nearest enemy soldier the world has never seen before or since trenches like those on the western front they led 
 one into the other for hundreds of miles front line trenches reserve trenches interlacing communication trenches all tied together in 
 huge city like networks and labelled with the names of home town streets over and over the trenches were built 
 demolished and rebuilt soldiers slept in holes scraped in the trench walls and on cots squeezed into dugouts engineers sappers 
 they were called tunnelled beneath no man s land to plant mines under enemy trenches and sometimes encountered hostile tunnellers 
 headed the other way the lessons of survival in trenches were quickly learned no orchestra conductor ever studied the delicate 
 nuances of collected sounds more closely than the soldiers on the western front we can sort out all the different 
 explosions wrote english poet robert graves in his book goodbye to all that and disregard whichever don t concern us 
 such as the artillery duel machine gun fire at the next company to us desultory rifle fire but we pick 
 out at once the faint plop of the mortar that sends off a sausage or the muffled rifle noise when 
 a grenade is fired bullets were different they could not be dodged rifle bullets in the open went hissing into 
 the grass without much noise wrote graves but when we were in a trench the bullets made a tremendous crack 
 as they went over the hollow bullets often struck the barbed wire in from of the trenches which sent them

 was sleep during the day men struggled to repair the damaged trenches and kept an eye out for surprise attacks 
 at night they raided enemy trenches repaired the barbed wire in from of their own trenches retrieved wounded from no 
 man s land and stood lookout men learned to sleep while working even in the roar of artillery fire a 
 man filling a sand bag suddenly discovered that the soldier holding it open for him had fallen sound asleep i 
 could fall asleep wrote graves sitting down standing marching lying on a stone floor or in any other position at 
 a moments s notice at any time of day or night rats became a menace almost as unnerving as the 
 enemy they fed on unburied corpses the surrounded and sometimes filled the trenches men eating in dugouts took potshots at 
 rats crawling along the wooden supports when a new officer joined graves s company he was given a dug out 
 with a spring bed when he turned in that night he heard a scuffling shone his torch on the bed 
 and found two rats on his blankets tussling for the possession of a severed hand this story circulated as a 
 great joke men grew accustomed to the casual presence of dead flesh in one trench said british writer gerald brenan 
 the dried up hand of a dead german or frenchman jutted out from the wall and some of the men 
 when they passed by shook it to bring good luck a british corporal whose closeness to corpses had driven him

 were sometimes taken to retrieve wounded stranded in no man s land siegfried sassoon tells how he decided to go 
 after a wounded man who had been abandoned by returning members of a night patrol he climbed in rain and 
 darkness along the slushy slopes of craters close enough to the enemy to hear rifle bolts click he finally found 
 the man dragged him out of the crater and got him to a trench patrols were always going out into 
 no man s land to get information about the enemy stealth was important and for weapons men resorted to bayonets 
 clubs and kitchen knives taped to the ends of broomsticks before going out men pooled their money to be divided 
 among survivors one night graves went with a sergeant to determine if an enemy trench was occupied after dark with 
 toeless socks pulled over their bare knees to protect them from scrapes the men crawled from their trench we went 
 10 yards at a time slowly not on all fours but wriggling flat along the ground after each movement we 
 lay and watched for about 10 minutes we crawled through our own wire entanglements and long a dry ditch ripping 
 our clothes on more barbed wire glaring into the darkness until it began turning round and round once i snatched 
 my fingers in horror from where i had planted them on the slimy body of an old corpse we found 
 the gap in the german wire and at last came within five yards of the saphead the end of the 
 trenchl we waited quite 20 minutes listening for any signs of its occupation 0:occupa 0:tion then i nudged sergeant townsend 
 and revolver in hand we wriggled quickly forward and slid into it the trench was unoccupied and graves returned safely 
 to his trench patrols sometimes gave way to direct conversations as a method of obtaining information form the enemy soldiers 
 shouted at each other across no man s land hoping to taunt the enemy into answering friendly messages were sometimes 
 sent in undetonated rifle grenades one reported the safety of a pet dog that had strayed over from the enemy 
 side and on the first christmas of the war in 1914 men on both sides climbed out of their trenches 
 and met in no man s land to talk sing and swap souvenirs and cigarettes a reprint from life magazine

 89 the patrician 1992 profile in history 50 years ago in 19411 joined the army engineers but my grandmother didn 
 t want me to go overseas so got me out of the service i was 16 at the time and 
 living in alberta when i turned 18 1 reenlisted 0:re 0:enlisted in the engineers and was stationed at chilliwack when 
 we got word of a new outfit called the paratroopers twelve of us volunteered and were sent to montreal where 
 we went through a battery of psychiatrists to find out if we were suitable for the paratroopers which at the 
 time was a very selective unit after being accepted we were sent to georgia where we trained with the americans 
 then returned to camp shilo and from there to england but i still wasn t oldenough togooverand was held back 
 until my 19th birthday when i did get there i had take another course learning to jump from aircraft with 
 floor exits having trained on c 47 s we were known as the first canadian paratroopers on the night on 
 june sth 1944 we enplaned in england it was still daylight and flying over the lush countryside i remember wondering 
 if i d ever see this beautiful island again we were the pathfinders thirty of us that crossed the channel 
 that night flying at a very low altitude to avoid the german radar when we reached the coast we did 
 a pop up to 400 feet across the coastal defences at 10 minutes after midnight we jumped 50 pounds of 
 equipment strapped on my back and became the first allied troops to land in occupied france the battle of normandy 
 had began and eventually 1 500 000 troops would follow us when we jumped our padre s parachute got hung 
 up on a catholic church steeple and he was left dangling back and forth it was a strange coincidence him 
 being a r c and all he was shot and killed i don t know if it was on purpose 
 or a ricochet the germans weren t usually bad soldiers if you were hung up in a tree they d 
 help you down and take you prisoner the nazis were something else we lost nine of our men in that 
 jump five killed and four wounded on the 13thofjune 1944 the seaborne troops the scottish sth battalion of the black 
 watch broke through to us they took up a position on our left and put up machine guns the remainder 
 of our company went over to assist the black watch which was under going a severe attack by the germans 
 i got wounded that night sent to a field hospital and returned to england the following day by hospital ship 
 at 10 00 a m on the 24th of march 1945 the first canadian paratroopers jumped across the rhine into 
 germany this was the biggest airborne operation that had ever taken place during the war at that time three american 
 divisions and one british each airborne division consists of 5000 men and the dakotas we were flying in only carried 
 twenty out fitted men with the american squadron and the tug aircraft pulling gliders it took 3 hours for the 
 whole air armada to pass once again the canadians were the first to jump but the germans were expecting us 
 and we lost a lot of aircraft and men from there we marched and rode tanks across northern germany until 
 we reached wismar a port city on the baltic sea coast the german fortifications around the city were now abandoned 
 we set up road blocks and shortly afterwards the russians arrived but we had orders to not let them through 
 it wasn t until we got back to england that we found our why the allies wanted wismar so bad 
 there was a german submarine in port with a new device called the snorkel that the allied navies didn t 
 have i was home in canada and planning to go to the far east when the bomb was dropped and 
 the war over eleven of the original 30 pathfinder paratroopers had been killed i was out of the military for 
 a year to the day joined up again in 1946 and stayed for another 29 years this reporter for the 
 money andy ha we got 1 20 a day and 75 cents danger pay during the second world war the 
 commissioned ranks got 2 00 not sure if they were worth it in korea i didn t jump the korean 
 soldiers were different jungle fighters and very sneaky would think nothing of digging a tunnel for two miles i spent 
 28 years with the princess patricia s did peace keeping tours in the middle east and taught arctic survival as

 91 the patrician 1992 peacekeeping monument unveiled in ottawa by tom macgregor the national peacekeeping monument in ottawa was two 
 years in the making but that didn t stop sculptorjack harman from improvising just days before the unveiling the monument 
 called the reconciliation was unveiled oct 8 by gov gen ray hnatyshyn and other officials it is the creation of 
 harman urban designer and architect richard henriquez and landscape architect cornelia hahn oberlander all of british columbia it is located 
 near the national gallery of canada within sight of the parliament buildings three 10 footbronzemilitaryfiguresstandontwoconverging limestone walls representing opposing factions 
 the word reconciliation 0:recon 0:ciliation the phrase in the service of peace and the names of peacekeeping missions from korea 
 in 1947 to somalia in 1992 appear on the wall war debris and wild flowers are scattered between the walls 
 while a grove of 12 oak trees suggesting canada s 10 provinces and two territories stands beyond the words rudyard 
 kipling chose for the sone of remembrance in liveth for evermore appear on a wall around the grove to commemorate 
 those who have died on peacekeeping operations the figures are an armed peacekeeper an observer with binoculars and a communicator 
 in a kneeling position the latter is talking into a portable radio in the original design the armed figure is 
 looking at the peace tower on parliament hill but when harman was overseeing the placement of the figures he changed 
 his mind when i got there and saw traffic it was quite overwhelming i noticed we could put the armed 
 soldier looking at the word reconciliation it would be as if he were searching for a solution once we moved 
 him we had to turn around the figure with binoculars so he looks at the peace tower it was less 
 militaristic i felt it worked at a news conference before the unveiling project director col john gardam said he agreed 
 with the change and called the monument an inspiration to current members of the forces this is the first national 
 monument with military figures unveiled in ottawa since 1939 he said referring to the national war monument the last thing 
 we want to see is another monument to war the monument cost 2 8 million national defence paid 2 3 
 million while the national capital commission donated the land and paid 500 000 plus design construction management and the ongoing 
 maintenance costs ncc chairman marcel beaudry said it is fitting that the monument should be located in the heart of 
 the capital on confederation boulevard and that it should be surrounded by some of our most important national symbols the 
 monument was commissioned shortly after the 1988 nobel peace prize was awarded to un peacekeepers canada is the only country 
 that has participated in all un peacekeeping missions two canadians died on peacekeeping missions this summer bringing the total number 
 of deaths to 85 the unveiling took place on a warm autumn day with approximately 1 000 onlookers close to 
 1 500 cunent and former members of un and other peacekeeping operations marched to the ceremony the governor general in 
 uniform as commanderin chief 0:commander 0:in 0:chief of the canadian forces opened the ceremony say ing it was appropriate for 
 canada to have the first monument to peacekeeping 0:peacekeep 0:ing canada was not forged in battle but with reason negotiation 
 and compromise he said before unveiling the armed soldier figure the observer figure was unveiled byu ambassador louise frechette canada 
 s permanent representative at the un and un under secretary general for peacekeeping operations marrack goulding the third figure was 
 unveiled by chief of defence staff gen john de chastelain retired general ramsey withers and cwo frank hughes of communications 
 command who served on five peacekeeping operations prime minister brian mulroney announced the government would issue the special service medal 
 with a bar for peacekeeping to canadians who accumulated 180 days in designated peacekeeping 0:peace 0:keeping operations but who do 
 not have the continuous time to qualify for un medals the special service medal has only been awarded once to 
 engineers who taught afghans in pakistan to clear mines legion journal april the ceremony ended with a flypast of a 
 hercules and helicopters there was also a march past that included the guard of honour a colour party and 32 
 contingents from peacekeeping operations most of those marching wore the blue berets of the un while those who were with 
 the observer force still overseeing the camp david agreement between egypt and israel wore rusty brown berets members of the

 92 the patrician 1992 ppcli band what has the ppcli band been up to 1992 was another busy year for 
 band members you have probably noticed that the band is in a different building the move was made this fall 
 to new facilities which are located in the same building as the museum of the regiments the band s command 
 has also changed it is now under lfwahq instead of cfb calgary outside of these changes it was business as 
 usual the schedule included a trip to europe in april where the band had the honour of playing at the 
 75th anniversary of the battle of vimy ridge there were also remembrance ceremonies in dieppe and passchendale upon the band 
 s return rehearsal began in earnest for a busy parade season along with appearances at military parades you could tune 
 in and see the band on tv marching in the stampede and klondike days parades in october the band performed 
 a challenging and exciting concert program at the cosmopolitan music society concert hall in edmonton the audience was most impressed 
 and demanded an encore the year ended off with the annual christmas concert at jack singer concert hall which has 
 become a city tradition it was busy and memorable year for the band and it looks like 1993 will be 
 equally rewarding 
 93 the patrician 1992 cfb baden infantry battalion plaque a photograph of the bronze plaque that will be presented to 
 the village of hugelsheim on 14 may 1993 3 rcr will present the plaque on behalf of all infantry units 
 which have served at cfb baden the plaque is three feet long two feet wide and weighs approximately 70 pounds 
 it will hang inside the rathaus in hugelsheim once it is presented during a canadian appreciation weekend from 14 16 
 may 1993 it will be visible proof of our presence here once the base closes in december 1993 
 94 the patrician 1992 the royal green jackets options for change 1992 has been a momentous year for the army 
 and the regiment not least because of the options for change exercise which required the infantry to be reduced from 
 55 to 38 battalions including one from the royal green jackets barracks which will have important implications for regimental 0:regimen 
 0:tal assets such as the officers and sergeants messes and the chapel regular battalion the current 1 2 and 3 
 rgj stemmed directly from the 43rd 52nd krrb and the rifle brigade in 1958 and 1965 now that we have 
 been reduced to two regular battalions we havedeliberately 0:have 0:deliberately renumbered them to eliminate that direct link making the point 
 on what was called mor merger day 25 july 1992 the rgj regimental birthday 1 rgj merged with 2 and 
 3 rgj to form a two battalion regiment 2 rgj presently in omagh renumbered as 1 rgj they are due 
 to arms plot to cyprus in 1993 3 rgj presently in dover renumbered as 2 rgj and assumed the amf 
 l role for what has up to now been a four year period the t and r company titles will 
 leave the regular battalion and will possibly be used by the regimental phase i and ii recruit companies winchester adult 
 training in future infantry adult recruit training will consist of two phases phase i the common military syllabus to be 
 done by everyone in the army to be carried out in what are to be called army training regiments and 
 phase 11 special to arm training to be carried out in arms centres we are to be allowed to continue 
 to do our phase i training at winchester where the rac the new adjutant general s corps the army air 
 corps and the intelligence corps recruits will also train our phase ii will be carried out at an interim location 
 at ouston and northumberland until the new centre is built at catterick in yorkshire thus our recruits will continue to 
 start their careers in our regimental home which is the most that we could have hoped for juniors juniors are 
 seen as a wasting asset because of the government s new education poficy and with the exception of our own 
 who will continue to be trained in sir john moore barracks are to be trained in separate junior leader s 
 regiments 0:regi 0:ments until the future is clearer to ensure that all bed spaces are filled we shall be joined 
 by rac army air corps and adjutant general corps junior leaders regimental headquarters now that our winchester home is secure 
 we can make long term plans for regimental headquarters we do not yet know what the future is for headquarters 
 light division but have been assured that whatever succeeds it will be allowed to stay in sir john moore territorial 
 battalions both 4 rgj and 5 rgj are to remain in the order of battle although in common with all 
 other ta battalions they are to be reduced to three company strength the future there is much follow on work 
 to be done but now that so much of the future is secure it can be regarded with optimism we 
 must thank all members of the regiment past and present for the mature sensible positive and helpful way in which 
 they have responded to the news of these far reaching changes we must also pay tribute to all ranks in 
 the regular battalions for the magnificent way in which they have conducted themselves in their tours of northern ireland where 
 they have earned high praise from many quarters in typical riflemanlike fashion the three commanding officers have turned the situation 
 to their advantage and used the opportunity to resolve many details affecting individuals while implementing the merger we still have 
 a viable regiment still based on its traditional 0:tradi 0:tional home which is by no means so far the remainder 
 of the army no other regiment i n the army has been required to have all its battalions on operations 
 in northern ireland at the sametime 0:same 0:time and certainly not at a time like this we venture to suggest 
 that no other regiment could carry this off but that is the standard that we know will be maintained in 
 the future 
 the patrician 1992 95 the regiment a summary account the light division depot the depot will re role and become 
 the army training regiment winchester on 2 apr 93 green jacket recruits will then complete their basic training of 10 
 weeks in sirjohn moore barracks before moving to ouston in the north despite the change winchester will remain at the 
 heart of the regiment retaining regimental headquarters chapel and the museum in addition to our links with the city the 
 cathedral and st cross cricket field in short the roots of the new army training regiment will be set firmly 
 in green jacket soil ist battalion now merged 1 rgj before mergeron 25july 1992 served forthe last time in northern 
 ireland together with the two other regular battalions which last occurred in 1972 since the troubles began in 1969 the 
 regiment has carried out 24 emergency and 4 garrison tours 11 of them by 1 rgj eight each by 2 
 and 3 rgj and one by r company the battalion was based at drumadd barracks in armagh and was responsible 
 forthe city and border areas a role of reassurance and deterrence including vehicle check points and patrolling particularly related to 
 the 39 border crossing points too busy to enjoy their surroundings a successful tour was completed before the battalion returned 
 to osnabruck west germany to prepare for merger the maj rity of riflemen transferred to 2 rgj back in omagh 
 northern ireland and the remainder to 3 rgj in dover prior to renumbering 0:renumber 0:ing on 25 july 1992 2nd 
 battalion now ist 1992 was the middle year in the 30 month tour as omagh resident battalion and it has 
 been every bit as fast and furious as the first on the regimental front the year was notable for the 
 way in which we merged with the 75 men and families from the original first battalion in osnabruck and assumed 
 their previous title we are happy to report that the first battalion is alive and well in omagh our experiences 
 with the terrorist in our tactical area of responsibility taor have been numerous we have had several contacts with the 
 enemy close quarter shoots petrol bomb and grenade attacks and to date we have been fortunate not to sustain any 
 casualties perhaps the most notable incident occurred in august when terrorists ambushed an urban foot patrol puncturing the patrol commander 
 s clothing but not him and then escaped in a stolen car fortunately another patrol was just able to get 
 in the way of the car s escape route and there followed a rapid exchange of fire as the car 
 roared through the patrol s position despite receiving 30 hits the car escaped into a housing estate complete with burst 
 tires and the ccupants fled a three day search peration in the same estate revealed one of the culprits complete 
 with substantial wounds secreted inside the frame of a divan bed in the house of a terrorist sympathiser we have 
 yet to witness his prosecution a short while later in the same area we were to find large quantities of 
 terrorist equipment in some of the most productive search operations that our taor has ever witnessed a vital ingredient of 
 our modus operandi is community relations winning the hearts and minds of the civilian population 0:popu 0:lation our soldiers have 
 worked hard and effectively assisted by the terrorist s increasing lack of concern for the safety of the population that 
 if purports to represent have made tangible progress anti security force elements in some of the more unlikely areasof the 
 taorare beginning to mellow as a degree of mutual trust and respect is cultivated life in our base location in 
 omagh has also witnessed its share of the action we have continued to experience some troubles with our close neighbours 
 in the adjacent nationalist estate there was an unsuccessful had grenade attack on a married quarter in march although stones 
 and bottles are more usual this is minor league trouble compared to the tragic fate that befell 14 of our 
 barrack maintenance contractors in january their van was blown up outside omagh whilst returning home after a day s work 
 in our barracks eight men died and the rest suffered terrible injuries these men were well known to our soldiers 
 and families and played an important part in our lives they are sorely missed we depend a great deal upon 
 those civilians who are prepared to risk working for us and we hold them all in great respect an important 
 aspect of life on a long tour in northern ireland is variety and getting away whenever possible on the military 
 training side two companies have conducted short exercises in england warcop and galloway we conducted a 6 weekjnco cadre 3 
 weeks of which were in warcop and a signals cadre in scotland we have also despatched personnel to usa and 
 hong kong for various training purposes on the adventure training from our wrac platoon later disbanded due tooptionsforchange disappeared to 
 ascension island for a week a rifle company found the requisite challenges locally in the mourne mountains whilst another went 
 further afield to spend a week of their leave in the south of france at platoon level a large number 
 of riflemen have taken advantage of the sports parachuting facilities available and have made their first jumps the youngest rifleman 
 in the battalion made his name in this field by winning the bronze medal novice in the army championships with 
 only 26 jumps to his name being under 18 and therefore unable to go on operations he learnt the ropes 
 on a temporary attachment to the local army parachute centre thus we are fortunate to be able to report another 
 successful year in omagh we have continued to work and play hard as our operational results and manpower retention figures 
 suggest our families are coping well with the significant additional problems that living in this part of the world present 
 
 96 the patrician 1992 those soldiers and families whom we received into our ranks from the original hirst battalion during 
 the course of the year settled in with typical green jacket flexibility and were quickly absorbed into the family time 
 flies and we now have some seven months before we hand over to 1 pwrr and take over from iwfr 
 in dhekelia cyprus to this end we have already sent five officers and two wives on recces to cypats and 
 we are now actively engaged in conventional training and course training preparations the first battalion is therefore in good order 
 and looking forward to bringing in the changes in august 3rd battalion now 2nd january 1992 found the 3rd battalion 
 halfway through its op banner tour of south armagh this was the first rural tour in northern ireland the battalion 
 having spent the previous 8 emergency deployments in the cities and towns of the province 0:prov 0:ince much hard work 
 and effort went into the training and preparation for this 6 months tour of duty and we arrived in south 
 armagh with no illusions as to the size of the task that lay before us with the whole regiment deployed 
 concurrently to ulster for only the second time in 23 years we were extremely fortunate to have the ist battalion 
 as our neighbours in north armagh in particular we were lucky to have letter c company under command in newtownhamilton 
 for 4 months this close operational relationship provided a vital link that was to help us all through the merger 
 later on in the year when the regiment reduced to 2 regular battalions at the end of the tour it 
 is worth recording that 3 rgj as the armagh roulement battalion arr conducted 234 operations at company or battalion level 
 all during the 6 month period from september 1991 to march 1992 this was achieved at the cost of only 
 one minor casualty to provisional ira activity a flesh wound to lcpl hughes of letter c company who has since 
 recovered the 3rd battalion returned to its home base in dover on 26 march to enjoy a months well earned 
 leave many faces had changed after the south armagh tour but the battalion settled down in the spring under a 
 clutch of new company commanders 0:command 0:ers to rebuild its convention capabilities phase i of the regimental merger began with 
 the start of support weapons cadres on 11 may 92 the milan mortar and recce cadres benefitted form the arrival 
 of the baor and gulf warriors from the ist battalion in osnabruk who brought with them much sought after experience 
 in june and july all the companies were able to get away from dover on their own to enjoy some 
 adventurous training in cornwall inverness and anglesey this was achieved with some extra financial support from the regimental trustees and 
 enabled further integration to take place amongst all rank prior to the merger that took place on 25 july 1992 
 merger day saw the passing into history of the 3rd battalion as it re numbered to become 2 rgj a 
 battalion muster parade was held in fort burgoyne an 1850 napoleonic fortification that forms part of cannaught barracks and this 
 was followed by an open day for all the families the evening saw both messes hold a joint cocktail party 
 and final sounding retreat in dover castle to which were invited all past members a nostalgic occasion by any standards 
 4th battalion on ist april we reorganized into 3 rifle companies a support company and headquarter company under options for 
 change although now officially an arrc ta bn affiliated to 24 air mobile brigade for training we have retained our 
 link with our baor mobile brigade 12 armoured and in april we sent a party of 40 people to participate 
 in a divisional cpx in germany in may we exercised with our peacetime brigade 56 london brigade on an exercise 
 with helicopter support on salisbury plain culminating in a battalion attack at dawn on sunday camp this year was at 
 sennybridge in september where during two wet weeks the battalion did two days adventurous training on the urecon beacons three 
 days platoon and company training five days live firing and two days continuous platoon competition the finale was a company 
 competition involving a 3 mile run the infamous sennybridge assault course and a falling plate competition the remainder of the 
 year concentrated on shooting 5 rgj joining us fora combined skill at arms meeting which was won by c company 
 although hq company won most of the prizes an advanced skill at arms meeting was held at the lydd hythe 
 complex in november the shooting team won all the silver on offer at the london district skill at arms meeting 
 and came a very creditable second at the ta meeting at bisley the mortar platoon took part in the uklf 
 mortar concentration firing over 600 rounds the milan and signals platoon ran cadres at camp and the mt platoon have 
 run a cadre at dover 1992 saw the 25th anniversary of the forming of 4 rgj in 1967 and we 
 celebrated with the normandy band sounding retreat in davies street in june we claim a fair share of publicity with 
 members of the battalion appearing on national television during the royal tournament the festival of remembrance 0:re 0:membrance at the 
 albert hall the lord mayor s show and the lord mayor s banquet individuals have managed to train in germany 
 kenya northern ireland switzerland and the usa we have seen many members of our affiliated regiments over the year and 
 still have almost enough members of the sydney university and the western australia university regiments with us to form a 
 london australian company in particular we shall be sad to see lieut david swan sydney university regiment leave us at 
 the end of the year we have certainly enjoyed his company and contribution 
 the patrician 1992 97 sth battalion last year s newsletter began with news of 5 rgj and options for change 
 and it would seem relevant to begin again at this point as the battalion has recently heard details of its 
 new role and establishment as a national defence battalion the home service force ceased to exist in april and the 
 battalion now remains with its 3 rifle companies we now know the national defence will currently mean battalion hq and 
 hq coy assisting hq the light division in the defence of the sw hampshire area with the rifle companies remaining 
 in their local patch combined with this change in our role we are now under command of aldershot area a 
 new headquarters set up in april 92 training in 1992 was off to a vigorous start with a freezing and 
 foggy battalion exercise in january on aldershot area followed by a busy cadre period with jncos milan recce mortars signals 
 and admin cadres being run from january to march the main training effort in the first half of the year 
 was a series of battalion exercise weekends at stanford in norfolk which prepared for the 2nd infantry brigade concentration in 
 september each exercise ended with a vigorous speed march stretcher race and some form of water related competition which caused 
 great team spirit and much rule breaking in june the battalion command element celebrated the last hot weekend 0:week 0:end 
 of the year in nbc suits at the battalion battle group trainer in bovington while the riflemen relaxed on the 
 ranges with the rsm injuly the milan platoon spent their annual camp on a highly successful milan concentration at otterburn 
 annual camp was this year held at stanford in norfolk in september also taking part in this brigade exercise was 
 2 rgj some members of which enjoyed our hospitality in the form of hot showers and all ranks in the 
 battalion enjoyed training alongside 0:along 0:side the regulars the highlight of the two weeks was a brigade ftx with 5 
 rgj covering all phases of war in some extremely wet weather other activities in a busy two weeks included the 
 entertainment of 57 young executives from oxfordshire and buckinghamshire on an exercise executive stretch and the entertainment of the whole 
 brigade by the qm s department in the form of a central barbecue since septembertraining activities have diversified we held 
 a successful battalion saam at pirbright alongside 4 rgj in october and a coy led the way in a parade 
 at the end of the month to exercise the battalion s right of the freedom of high wycombe a gale 
 blew as various important guests were persuaded to sit on wet seats whilst the mayor of h igh wycombe inspected 
 the guard alongside the commanding officer it was a highly successful event and a coy also organised an open day 
 and an employers evening to round off the weekend since then the recce platoon has won a bronze medal in 
 the cambrian patrol competition a new recruit selection and training procedure 0:proce 0:dure has been introduced and 80 ta soldiers 
 are about to spend a weekend adventure training in dent cumbria the annual officers dinner was held in the oxford 
 town hall in march with mr john keegan defence corespondent of the daily telegraph as the guest speaker and the 
 officers and snco messes both held successful dances in the summer e coy provided an honour guard for the queen 
 s visit to milton keynes in march and a coy have provided two guards for the dinners at our affiliated 
 livery company the worshipful company of furniture makers the waterloo band and bugles have been an outstanding success and have 
 won praise from all corners of oxfordshire and buckinghamshire they also completed their annual camp in june at the light 
 division depot which culminated in an excellent sounding of retreat with the regular bands for green jacket week injuly we 
 will have the added attraction of sending a large company to train in virginia usa with the national guard an 
 impartial view extracted from the regimental chronicle 1968 some may have note read sir arthur bryan s article in the 
 london illustrated news on 10th august 1968 in it he quotes and comments on a letter written in the daily 
 telegraph on 27th july 1968 by colonel c b appleby which urges the amalgamation rather than the disbandment of regiments 
 his article ended for even though a regiment suffers dilution through absorption in a large regiment the traditions of its 
 component parts can still survive to be handed down to their descendants the better the old regiment the more it 
 will contribute to the big regiment and mould the latter to destroy a regiment is to destroy a perpetual and 
 self renewing fount of human selflessness and devotion rather than allow it to perish its brave heart should be transplanted 
 and given to another ours is not a question of transplantation as all the old regiments will contribute equally to 
 the new but most will accept that events have proved the wisdom of those past decisions to form a green 
 jacket brigade and later a large regiment and perhaps the most difficult of all to create two new battalions best 
 wishes to you all in 1993
