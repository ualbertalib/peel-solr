 mm i if with many a blush of apology to our patient readers we bring forth this issue of the 
 patrician our only excuse for the delay in publication is the extent to which esquimalt station including the editorial staff 
 have been scattered all over western canada indeed we are just gathered more or less all together again for the 
 first time since early spring it is a source of constant surprise just how many things there are to be 
 done by those of us who are left at home and just how little spare time we have to devote 
 to this labour of love o 0 o this is our annual camping number as well as being the commencement 
 of volume three the 1935 camps are now completed and the last of us have returned home full of enough 
 gossip to last us well on to christmas our month at heal s was spent in almost perfect weather and 
 we got in some excellent training details of which will be found elsewhere in this issue quite a number of 
 our personnel attended the canadian small arms branch school at sarcee and we are glad to say all passed well 
 in their course the weather man was not so kind to alberta this year providing more rain than was strictly 
 necessary 2 
 3 for the conduct of the school but then we can t have everything 0:every 0:thing o 0 o our 
 limited space forbids any detailed description of the two courses anti gas and tactical training which our junior officers attended 
 at the conclusion of the small arms school but we hope next issue to revive memories of those happy three 
 weeks with a few pertinent comments o 0 o shilo camp we hear was not very kind to headquarters and 
 a company who got pretty thoroughly rained on during their stay there nevertheless they managed to do some very good 
 training by all accounts o 0 o we are very glad to see major j h carvosso m c here 
 on a visit as we go to press by appearances the shilo weather agreed with him hearty congratulations to captain 
 a w hunt m m both on his showing on the last bisley team and on vanning a place on 
 the next one it is a record we are all proud of as we go to press we learn of 
 the promotion to brevet major of captain x c burness m c and take this opportunity of extending our congratulations 
 o 0 o we hope that both the design and colour of our cover slightly changed with this issue meet 
 with the approval of our readers o 0 o we received a pleasant surprise the other day when the postman 
 brought our copy of the goat the journal of the royal canadian dragoons with a brand new red coat and 
 a reduction in the size of its pages it presented a very smart and pleasing appearance we also note that 
 the publication office has been moved to regimental headquarters at toronto we are pleased to offer our congratulations to the 
 goat in its new form and wish it many years of successful publication we are also pleased to acknowledge receipt 
 of the strathconian 0:strath 0:conian journal of lord strathcona s horse royal canadians and the lancashire lad journal of the 
 loyal regiment north lancashire 0 0 0 yours faithfully 
 4 esquimalt station notes b company moved to ileal s camp on the 30th of may with about 60 all 
 ranks there was a noticeable absence of our fourlegged 0:four 0:legged friends which contrasted favourably with last year s record 
 some there are who decry the lack of that tinkling music that nightly would lull us to slumber but personally 
 we would just as soon count imaginary sheep as be blessed with the presence of the genuine article the advance 
 party under lieut sutherland had prepared for our coming and we were soon settled down and hard at work shooting 
 bulls etc the engineers had repaired our telephone line to durrance road and very useful it was daily would two 
 stalwart warriors take up their position at the road terminals and carry on the most entertaining conversations with the butts 
 v ho can forget the thrill when a herd of cows was reported in the vicinity all activity on the 
 range ceased and the erstwhile firers enthusiastically laid bets on the probability of the herd clearing the danger zone before 
 lunch h r e never realised before just how restful traffic could be varying this with a delightful programme of 
 road repairing brush cutting etc the time quickly passed and the annual hegira to sarcee started indeed we were not 
 left together for long on 17th june lieut wiswell started the movement eastward 
 5 when he departed for the central machine gun camp at sarcee where he was shortly joined by q m 
 5 1 g a carr m m corporal bundock and l cpi hall the rest of us stayed at heal 
 s until the 29th june and had a fairly busy time after the annual classification was finished came the field 
 firing this is usually done later in the year at comox but as our projected programme for this year does 
 not include a visit to that delightful resort we carried out this training at heals lieut sutherland spent only a 
 very short time at heal s before departing for shaughnessy military hospital in vancouver where he provided some excellent practice 
 for the surgeons he is now going strong on b wing however and apparently none the worse for the removal 
 of whatever it was that the doctors wanted before leaving heal s we had a smoking concert that proved both 
 original and clever major w g colquhoun m c officially presented the machine gun platoon with the walker cup which 
 they won last year and gave miniatures to the members of the team at the same time he presented various 
 certificates to members of the company incidentally we seem to remember that the cc himself got a certificate wasn t 
 it something about education c s m mitchell did the honours as chairman and marshalled a fine programme the highlight 
 of the evening was a drama of the rifle range enacted by cpl bundock and co highly original and true 
 to life this play evoked the admiration of the assembly in no small fashion someone was heard to remark that 
 ghandi shaw s performance was almost too natural to be play acting cpl q uinn read an original poem which 
 we have the honour to print elsewhere in this issue and ptes shaw and watson gave a life like interpretation 
 of how the village maidens in waikiki spend their leisure hours pte clark w t gave some fine guitar solos 
 and vocal selections were heard from a large number of the company oh yes we heard the inside life story 
 of pte teskey reported personally to the c s m the time at heal s this year was all too 
 short and we found ourselves back in barracks for the summer sooner than we would have wished scarcely were we 
 back and settled down when the main body of the sarcee contingent began to leave us captain l m black

 of changes in one fell swoop we lost our machanist sergeant and three section commanders which to say the least 
 was not a good start for the training season but after all is said and done there were others ready 
 trained to carry on the good work great work was accomplished and a good training season held at shilo camp 
 some 9 miles south of the old camp hughes

 the m g platoon was able to supply quite a number for the canadian small arms school sarcee camp alberta 
 both as students for a and b wings and also as details we also sent fifteen to the m g 
 concentration camp at shilo man at which camp the platoon had a chance of carrying out some real training this 
 year we were able to do machine gun firing on open ranges which we have not been able to do 
 since our last training at camp hughes the majoritjr of our firing had to be done at the st charles 
 ranges near winnipeg 
 11 there was some very interesting work carried out demonstrating 0:demonstrat 0:ing to us very clearly the co operation needed 
 between the air force and ground troops we also took part in several tactical exercises in co operation with a 
 company and the cavalry o 0 o sergeants mess dear mr editor whilst having a quiet game of snooker in 
 the mess a few days ago the r s m informed me that i would be responsible for providing the 
 patrician with sergeants mess news for the next edition well i gasped and gulped and gave away a perfectly good 
 black on the next shot yes you are quite right it was against my national instinct to give away anything 
 the first thing i thought of was that line of tennyson s in his poem to the sea i would 
 that my tongue could utter the thoughts that arise in me however as the r s m was still present 
 those thoughts could not be uttered so here i am knowing you as i do mr editor i am sure 
 you will not object to opening our business with a small drop of scotch how the subject theme may gang 
 let chance and time determine perhaps it may turn oot a sang perhaps turn oot a sermon since we were 
 last in touch with you through the medium of your esteemed and widely read paper several interesting events have taken 
 place amongst our members on the 23rd may sgt and mrs hird celebrated their silver wedding and were the recipients 
 of several gifts from their many friends drewrys hall was the scene of the celebration and after a mock wedding 
 our commanding officer lt col h w niven d 5 0 m c presented the couple with a silver tea 
 service from their friends in fort osborne barracks sgt hird never looked so happy since the night he found the 
 dime ten years ago and the evening was certainly spent in good spirits i am sure we all join in 
 wishing sgt and mrs hird many more years of wedded life together our next item of interest was our pilgrimage 
 to shilo on the 2nd of june and if the wedding had any semblance of being wet our arrival at 
 shilo to use a common phrase had it skinned a mile the rain poured unceasingly for days however we ultimately 
 0:ultim 0:ately made ourselves comfortable and i think pretty well remained so until the end of camp we returned to 
 winnipeg on the 7th july leaving a few behind for a machine g un school as the mother of twins 
 said troubles never come singly for we had hardly established ourselves back in barracks when tho news was broken to 
 us that c s m leighton was getting married so tho members in winnipeg accompanied by their good ladies attended 
 
 12 the ceremony in all saints church and heard the words of doom pronounced here again i know all our 
 friends at the coast join us in wishing c s m and mrs leighton all that is good a social 
 evening was enjoyed afterwards by the members and wives and sweethearts as well you see we still have some single 
 members as an army becomes mechanized so naturally old war horses disappear s m i r tunnah has retired to 
 pension and s m i e scrutton leaves on the same mission in a few days all the loving links 
 that bind us while the days are going by one by one we leave behind us while the days are 
 going by i understand they are both going to reside in toronto strikes me i have somewhere read a phrase 
 in death they were not divided sgt r a agar another sun tanned veteran from the heights of shilo is 
 also leaving us he too going to pension where bob and mrs agar intend making their home i don t 
 know but our good wishes go with them plus fours and golf clubs are much in evidence here this summer 
 in fact afternoons are being sneaked off to go to deer lodge course but i believe lost balls are few 
 and far between they don t go very far out of sight our friend sgt bliss looks especially well in 
 his outfit all that is lacking is a decent pair of legs r s m mcculloch returned from dundurn two 
 weeks ago and the instructors from shilo over the week end all are looking hale and hearty well supplied with 
 a tan should you in the coming season at vancouver race track see a jockey spick and span with a 
 perfect poise hanging desperately 0:desper 0:ately against a horse s ears as it proudly careers past the winning post you 
 will know it is sgt dunn as he has just been attached to lord strathcona s horse for three weeks 
 at shilo and i can assure you he makes an ideal cavalry man what is it a trooper is famed 
 for there is still one more departure i have to record our good friend q m s l spike delaney 
 left us recently on transfer to the r m c kingston ont he had spent almost fifteen years on this 
 station had learned his soldiering and gained his promotion 0:prom 0:otion here and what s more fallen in love and 
 he really felt a bit sorry to go well spike we all wish you the best i hope mr editor 
 you will give me the benefit of the first offender s act in this my maiden report it was king 
 david when absolem was in trouble said to his accusers deal gently with the young man to our brothers beyond 
 the rockies we send greetings sincerely yours optimist o 0 o 
 13 band notes the regimental band was kept busy at shilo camp playing daily programmes of music to the officers 
 mess sergeants mess and outside the men s dining marquee they also entertained the non permanent active militia on several 
 occasions in camp these programmes were much enjoyed on july 4th the band proceeded to brandon manitoba where they officiated 
 at the opening ceremony of the western canadian fairs since their return from shilo camp it is interesting to note 
 that the early israelites were once stationed at camp shiloh but they didn t have to polish their lamps and 
 bowls every saturday because saturday was their sabbath the bandsmen have been busy playing in the winnipeg parks and on 
 the barrack green on august 13th they proceeded to pine falls manitoba where they took part in the re opening 
 ceremony of the paper mills a special train was chartered by the winnipeg free press and following a short programme 
 of music on arrival the band were taken for a tour of inspection over the mill first of all they 
 were shown the huge pile of logs which are used for the manufacture of the paper these are carried along 
 on rollers into a great cylinder where they are stripped of their bark and thoroughly washed next they go through 
 a grounding process where they are converted into fine pulp this pulp is carried on more rollers through multitudinous machines 
 marvellous 0:marvel 0:lous pieces of man s ingenuity dried and cleaned and after various processes too numerous to mention eventually 
 arrives at the terminus as beautifully manufactured paper of a soft and fine texture to anyone who has never seen 
 how paper is made we advise them strongly to avail themselves of the first opportunity they get not only is 
 the sight fascinating but extremely educational the only change in the personnel of the band is the advent of bdsm 
 evans a new drummer whom we welcome and wish every happiness 0:happi 0:ness to during his sojourn with us we 
 have disquieting reports that sgt pete mcgarry d c m is about to leave us shortly to proceed on pension 
 pete is an extremely popular member of the band and we shall be more than sorry to lose him we 
 fear his vacancy will be very difficult to fill things we would like to know who was the r o 
 s at shilo who at reveille banged his cane on the walls of his tent he was the only occupant 
 and very vociferously in language not compatible with the tranquil surroundings 0:surroun 0:dings of the camp yelled how many more 
 blinking times am i to 
 14 tell you to get out of that blinking bed who said on the occasion when the band were compelled 
 due to most inclement weather to stay the night at an hotel instead of returning to camp i don t 
 3ee why the band want to stay at an hotel when they can get running water in their tents did 
 barrington really go to brandon for the express purpose of buying cough mixture did swift and manns ever use their 
 inspection bowl for washing purposes does freddy still smoke the same brand of cigars o 0 o editor s note 
 the following incident actually happened at dundurn sask during the recent n p a m training it was an outpost 
 scheme and the advanced guard mounted troops with the assistance of the vanguard had concluded the first phase of the 
 operation in which they had successfully dislodged the enemy to force his withdrawal from his advanced position the scheme continued 
 towards the second phase with the mounted troops the vanguard and the main guard moving off in perfect order suddenly 
 from the vicinity of the right rear of the main guard promiscuous blank rifle fire could be heard emanating from 
 a position offering all the advantages of good cover and good field of fire after listening intently to the steady 
 rate of fire and studying the position and direction of the fire the chief umpire decided to investigate the strange 
 circumstances upon reaching the position about two hundred yards to the flank the chief umpire discovered a lone cavalryman hugging 
 the cover and firing in the direction of tho vanguard which could be seen marching down the road a short 
 distance ahead what are you doing here my man enquired the umpire i belong to tho cavalry sir replied my 
 man 1 at the same time taking aim and releasing another blank round what are you aiming at don t 
 you know those are your own men in front are they replied the astonished marksman i thought they were the 
 enemy but it doesn t make any difference which side i belong to as i m a lousy shot anyway 
 and wouldn t have hit anybody 0:any 0:body if i d been using a field gun at this distance o

 15 royal canadian school of infantry machine gums m d no 10 since the last edition of the patrician the 
 royal school staff has been active with the m g concentration camp at shilo with captain k c eurnoss m 
 c chief instructor of the school as camp commandant and lieut j g andrews as instructor the sub staff for 
 this camp consisted of s m i e scrutton q m s i d j deßochie sgt instr j c 
 cave sgt instr w p vincent sgt r dunn sgt f bliss just one big happy family the camp was 
 divided into three periods of training consisting 0:consis 0:ting of one week each the first week the 2nd motor machine 
 gun brigade and the ist machine gun squadron worked together the second week the 10th bn canadian machine gun corps 
 from winnipo and the 12th bn c m g c from regina showed keen competition and excellent training during the 
 week the third week was utilized for the training of the m g groups of the h q wings of 
 the following regiments queen s own cameron highlanders of canada winnipeg light infantry royal winnipeg rifles winnipeg grenadiers regina rifle 
 regiment saskatoon light infantry manitoba rangers in all 48 officers and 500 other ranks were exercised during the m g 
 concentration camp as this goes to press we are about to commence another part ii course of instruction in winnipeg 
 numbers expected to report for this course are 9 officers and 24 other ranks captain j n edgar m c 
 will undertake the duties of chief instructor assisted 0:assis 0:ted by s h i scrutton r s m i lcculloch 
 sgt blis3 subject x candidates and sgt dunn as there is much preparatory work to be done in this connection 
 we shall have our hands full for the next few weeks at this point it is seemly to say good 
 bye to s m i r tunnah honourable bob and when he reads hi 3 copy of the patrician we 
 would like him to know that the good wishes of all ranks of the regiment go out to him o 
 0 o 
 it does us all good to get up here and meet friends from the other station indeed we so seldom 
 see each other that it is surprising that we are ahlo to work together at all i am speaking or 
 writing if you will of a combined demonstration platoon that we furnished on saturday 20th july for the edification of 
 the it p a m units then in camp the personnel of the platoon was about equally divided between winnipeg 
 and esquimalt stations and under command of lieut a h eraser gave a demonstration of platoon drill after y hich 
 our own inimitable sergt pink took charge and showed all those present how to do arms drill on the march 
 speaking as a mere spectator the show was well done and very convincing and the men certainly did work well 
 together 1 however what i started to say was that this year there are some forty seven of the regiment 
 here nine offiiertr and thirty eight other ranks fairly well divided between the two stations we are meeting several ney 
 faces especially from winnipeg which has quite a number of people on small arms school that are new to us 
 the air has been fairly thick with gossip and all the old battles have been fought over again at least 
 a scare of times by all concerned it is always a pleasure too to meet and work with our old 
 friends tho strathcona s this year we were fortunate in being present at the celebration df their fiftieth anniversary also 
 0:anniversary 0:also july 20th not only because we got a holiday from classes but because of the fine show they 
 put on in the morning they were inspected by brigadier i w b spry s 0 8 e v i 
 d o c m d 13 for which ceremony we were allowed to leave our studies and become spectators a 
 good feature of the event was that major f m w harvey v c m c and a number of 
 officers and men from a squadron at winnipeg were able to be present there was also a large group of 
 old comrades who took part in tho parade mounted sports took place in the afternoon though we may not be 
 so hot at this form of activities we enjoyed wat ching them a nd they were good strathcona s turned 
 to something more in our line when they put on their dismounted sports the winners can well be proud for 
 the competition was keen the day finished with a dance for all ranks in the sergeant s mosti that everting 
 to which many of us were invited it was a grand finish to a full day and we were all 
 glad that i the next morning w s a sunday mough saidj the strathcona s are good host 
 17 some few of us including lieut wiswell carr c s m i s wilson and spiers corporals bundock and 
 hall were present at the n p a m maohina gun concentration from 24th june to 6th july the 11th 
 and 13th bns c m g c and detachments 0:detach 0:ments from eight infantry regiments attended this camp when they 
 fired their annual course competitions etc and did a certain amount of tactical training over on well known high butte 
 it was a busy two weeks especially for the school staff or so we think but the units were certainly 
 keen and got through their rather ambitious programs in good style o 0 o the small arms school this year 
 is a big one there are some 60 f i 1 candidates in both wings and 110 students from the 
 n p a m fortunately the weather has been excellent throughout touch v ood it would be quite a problem 
 to house all the squads on a wet day the carden loyd section from winnipeg hr s boon demand they 
 were kept very busy during the machine gun camp both giving demonstrations and transporting various units and their guns on 
 tactical schemes how they r xe at it again for the c s a s this year only two machines 
 are with us but they certainly came in handy incidentally wo heard one of the instructors say just the other 
 day that he thought they were a bit dusty to ride in just imagine such a thingl owing to unforseen 
 activities elsewhere our old friends the details are not with us from winnipeg this year the personnel of the carden

 good emanating from his appointment in the morning considering everything he had much to be thankful for despite the depression 
 his stocks were gilt edged his philanthropic 0:philanthrop 0:ic contributions to the hospitals would continue indefinitely he regretted though the 
 rather unfortunate misunderstanding that had cropped up between him and angela she had been a good wife the discovery of 
 that incriminating letter what a fool he d been if only he had waited given her the opportunity to explain 
 instead he had sent her out of his life sent away the woman he loved most in all the world

 20 111 i slife 1 1 we were very glad indeed to receive a visit from ex sgt c e 
 palmer the other day he is looking exceedingly fit and he entertained us with some anecdotes of the service battalion 
 that somehow or other are not included in the regimental history mr palmer has undertaken to write sora of the 
 more interesting of these hitherto unpublished incidents which we hope to print in the next isgue we are also glad 
 to announce that mr palmer has been appointed special correspondent for ex patricia affairs in vancouver and we are looking 
 forward to printing some very interesting accounts of the doings of the old comrades association 0:assoc 0:iation in the next 
 and subsequent issues unfortunately mr palmer s appointment was made while he was on holiday and it will not be 
 possible to get any copy from him for this issue o 0 o ex cpl gilbert smith no 835 was 
 in town recently he is advance agent for the journey s end theatrical company in the days of whistling hardware 
 he used to have visions of getting the d s o these days he says all he is hankering for 
 is s r o o 0 o ex sgt c a mattinson recently spent several weeks in victoria as the 
 guest of ex c q m s c w and mrs norton we are very glad to state that the 
 holiday was benificial and mr mattinson returned to vancouver considerably improved in health e hope the improvement will be lasting 
 o 0 o ex pte pete burgess paid a brief visit to victoria last reek and spent his time looking 
 up old friends at work point ie pointed out that he worked at some place north of squamish and that 
 it took four days to reach victoria from there so that with only a week s holiday now and again 
 victoria was just outside 0:out 0:side his visiting radius we were very glad to see pete looking so well and 
 hope his employers will give him more than a week off occasionally so that he will be able to come 
 and see us again o 0 o four ex members of the regiment send us the information that 
 21 they are now no longer unemployed but have obtained good jobs fhey are ex ptes matthews b coy turnbull 
 and walker a toy all in the b c provincial police and woodrow b coy in the royal canadian mounted

 s m t j turnbull is now living in vancouver and hope that he will come over to victoria to 
 see ls in the near future since leaving the regiment last august i s m turnbull has travelled over ten 
 thousand miles o 0 o we print herewith an authentic autobiography by one of our ix comrades won t more 
 of our friends follow this lead fear mr editor well here s one good pat who although it may take 
 him a long time does let his old regiment know how things are going in his sphere of the life 
 outside i had best start at the beginning the natural thing to do is start with a holiday and start 
 to worry when the money is all lone no sooner said than done the next thing to do is to 
 make i personal reconnaissance of the situation that is if you can find no one to do this for you 
 whilst you rest after a night s lerry making result go back and enjoy life until all your iredit is 
 exhausted because despite the fact that you can slope lnd present arms to a high degree of smartness the average 
 imployer has no rifle with which you can prove your point there ire exceptions but very rare in this country 
 therefore acting in your own observations and on the advice of others you conclude hat eventually some kind fate will 
 bring a lucrative offer to lour doorstep apparently this is all quite correct as on the ist of april 1 
 was asked to report to the court house in vancouver after an interview i was told to report again the 
 next morning ready to leave vancouver immediately the which pleased me no end as by his time i was rather 
 sick of the sham and glitter of the hectic life in a seething metropolis as portrayed by the city of 
 greater lancouver dawn of the 2nd of april broke bright and merry some two ours later i also broke awoke 
 with a thick head but stay here beside me is a bottle of the famous bromo seltzer the effrvescent 0:eff 
 0:rvescent saline regulator what s this free advertising ed nd do i ever need regulating barely have i wiped the 
 bursting übbles 0:ubbles from my nose than i feel the urge to handspring from my rundle cot and greet the happy 
 morn with trilling song and ancing feet on the dot i am to be seen at the court house with 
 appy shining face and polished shoes soon my finery is stripped rom my limbs and tree i am reclothed polished 
 and fed by 
 22 fchree i am at the c n r depot ready to leave for the village of boston bar back 
 in harness and now as a fully fledged provincial policeman april in boston bar a pretty little hamlet nestling against 
 fthe rugged snow capped peaks of the mighty cascades the turbulent swollen fraser rushing past it s door a hundred 
 happy souls work fiere happy and almost untouched by the vile vices of modern civilization but alas see it now 
 torn with strikes and union roubles but these sturdy folks struggle on the daily train approaches the townsfolk as is 
 their wont come down to watch fthe great engine roar in despair is written in indelible lines fen their rugged 
 toil worn faces but stay who is this in irightly polished neatly pressed uniform stepping with firm fctride and proud 
 flung head from the mighty train yes it is he tatthews of the provincials you may believe me my work 
 was cut out for me but nothing taunted and despite the great odds i had to face with kindly face 
 but stern hand i crushed the seething revolt in a matter of wo weeks my work was done strife was 
 breaking out in other larts imagine the sorrowing kindly folk as i took my leave lut it must be so 
 on i went there was more to be done and i lust not tarry next i centred my activities in 
 the metropolis this was lame however and naturally for me did not last long you will lasily understand that a 
 man of my calibre could not very well be lept chaffing at the bit and so it came wars and 
 rumours of iters once more i was sent post haste the order came through at jive o clock in the 
 evening by seven my bag was packed and as i he train pulled out midst the wild cheering of thousands 
 i atthews of the provincials again went forth to quell the terrible utbreak went forth into the cold grim fastnesses 
 of the i ookies so that you and you and you could sleep safely and introublod corbin michel crow s 
 most pass natal these are towns of istory how can my poor pen tell of the strife and battle ink 
 s not sufficient it can only be written in blood these tales f daring of battle ambush thunder attack and 
 counter attack nsurgent turmoil strike espionage yea even invasion all hese and more much more who can tell of the 
 nights of waiting erhaps for the g rim reaper under leaden skies and cold snow rider foot cutting winds that 
 sweep through those great passes nknown to these men of the provincials but did they falter or all back not 
 one step did they cringe under the biting wind r tremble in the face of the great unknown no these 
 men were f sterner stuff work was to be done they were out to do it nd there could be 
 no turning from their road hard and rocky hough it was at last their work was done it was then 
 the middle of may 
 23 kay that conjures up in most of us a thought of flowers bees pind birds but not so these 
 men to them that may will long be remembered cold it was and snowing and the wind blowing a pale 
 the road down was memorable too the first green plant pas heralded with cheers and cries of delight i but 
 enough of this their rest though well earned was natched from their grasp as they reached for it at the 
 city of frenticton they received their orders and tarried not though it was nine o clock at night we embussed 
 and drove on vernon five liinutes to stop a cup of coffee and then press onward rushing through the night 
 high speed all the way every man baking his turn to drive the pace was too hot for one man 
 to stand very long summerland peachlandl okanagan landing fit last kamloops breakfast and then on again deep into the bridge 
 river country but alas the news of our coming had preceded us and all was quiet when we arrived a 
 week of waiting then once more the road home i but let me go back once more to kamloops here 
 we were glad o make the acquaintance of an ex patricia in the person of onstable de wit and though 
 the time was short he was soon ecognised as an old friend of b company as it was he who 
 had leared the way for us on the first route march from comox or erhaps he should be considered as 
 an enemy tyro weeks later i was in revelstoke seeing that the relief samp strikers did not fall off the 
 trains on their way east t was here i met mr wilson secretary of the canadian legion here which can 
 be recommended and an ex patricia any ex atricia 0:ex 0:atricia is assured of a hearty welcome in revelstoke where 
 the ld regiment is very highly thought of unfortunately i was not shle to stay very long in revelstoke but 
 went on to golden the leat here is terrible and very little is done outside of mere routine work soon 
 however another couple of provincials irrive and my partner and myself start the return trip home to vancouver nov vancouver 
 is in trouble again one would almost think t was big enough to look after itself this time it s 
 the waterfront 0:water 0:front our job is very dull and consists mainly of sitting around nth a bright face and 
 a couple of gas bombs this because of revious service we are re inforced and in the new draft we

 an hour later marsdon had ceased to exist he had been hanged by the neck until he was dead justice 
 had been satisfied 0:satis 0:fied for the murder of angela esther marsdon c fe j c in answer to a 
 query regarding the origin and history of our regimental colour we print the following which may answer similar questions in 
 the minds of others of our readers our first colour was worked by h r h princess patricia herself and 
 was presented to the regiment on 23rd august 1914 by the colonel in chief on receiving it lieut colonel f 
 farquhar d 5 0 our then commanding officer promised that the regiment would guard it with their lives and that 
 it would always remain with the regiment and that promise has been most faithfully kept the colour went to france 
 v ith the regiment on 20th december 1914 and returned to england bth february 1919 it was always at regimental 
 headquarters and when headquarters was in the front line the colour was there also the most conspicuous occasion of it 
 waving over our front line trenches was on bth may 1915 when it was hit by both sprapnel and bullets 
 but its inspiration to the troops on this date enabled them to hold out against terrific odds with no support 
 on either flank on the march in france it was always carried by an officer with proper escort and respect 
 and compliments were paid to it by all troops we met on 28th january 1919 in france the colour was 
 consecrated on 21st february 1919 in england our colonel in chief decorated it with a laurel wreath bearing the inscription 
 to the p p c l i from the colonel in chief patricia in recognition of their heroic services in 
 the great war 1914 1918

 night at soa till one season the average went ever so high and visions of bowls cambridge one floated by 
 and what sir was the cause of this high scoring boost ahl twas a sweet smelling liquid that we call 
 bulls eye juice now we use it for hair oil we use it as salts it cools off our hot 
 dogs in the ten minute halts and when an old sweat has been on the loose he perks up for 
 parade with a shot of the juice for years and years we shot ever so hard we missed it by 
 inches and then by a yard then up spoke a young lance jack sometimes call nick by gar i ve 
 a mixture that will just do the trick those easteners shoot well eh i ll cook their goose and he 
 swabbed out the bores with a drop of the juice old soldiers swear hard as they sweat and they toil 
 early rising they say is just banana oil why not wait till noon then rise from our roost all we 
 need is a drop of the old bulls eye juice and so came the morn of classification some waited with 
 fear some with jubilation the old sergeant cried men i can help you no more except with a little bull 
 juice in the bore the target frames worked until they were hot a rookie cried sir i can no see 
 the shot the reply it s your eyes boy you are living too loose lust bathe em twice daily with 
 issue bull juice then up came one bull then up came two and up came dozens before we were through 
 said the old sergeant grim it s one hell of a ruse but i m damned if i don t

 us to take over the duties of chief of the general staff although general ashton had only spent about eighteen 
 months with us as district officer commanding his presence will be greatly missed by all ranks of the garrison as 
 well as by the other troops in the district during his tour of duty here a great part of his 
 time was taken up with unemployment relief work but he nevertheless found time to interest himself personally in the troops 
 of the garrison both in their training and sports if it was possible general ashton attended smoking concerts and similar 
 gatherings in the garrison and frequently entertained us on these occasions with a fund of good stories we all wish

 operations of the royal canadian corps of signals the first dealt with the non military side of their work and 
 in this and subsequent articles the writer will describe some of the unvsual conditions under which personnel of the corps 
 do their work with a general description of a number of the more interesting and outlying stations in the far 
 north aklavik the most northerly point at which the r c signals operate an all year radio station is situated 
 in what is known as the mackenzie river delta the area around aklavik is typical delta country with low alluvial 
 flats through which the river has cut numerous channels and cross channels during high water the country is inundated leaving 
 lakes and marshes where muskrats abound making a reliable source of revenue for the trappers to the westward rise the 
 richardson mountains making a change in an otherwise monotonous landscape the summers are remarkable for long days the continuous light 
 for every hour of the day from the end of april to the end of august with six weeks in 
 which the sun never sets makes it necessary for one to change the customary waking and sleeping hours in midsummer 
 the days are very hot 5 millions of vicious mosquitos breed in the marshy lands f growth is phenomenal flowers 
 and grasses seem to spring up in no time winters are very severe the low flat land and low growing 
 trees allowing full sway for the arctic winds the coldest months are characterized by a complete absence of sun and 
 with only a few hours of grey twilight every day very little work can be done out of doors in 
 midwinter the gloom is more than compensated for by the magnificence of the full moon the brilliant stars and the 
 aurora borealis with its never ending pyrotechnic display the fur trade is the only excuse for the existence of aklavik 
 as it is the outfitting centre for many hundreds of square miles of extremely good fur country which supports about 
 100 white trappers and several hundred natives both indian and eskimo there is a permanent population in the district of 
 about 50 whites and about 100 natives the r c signals opened the wireless station in 1925 in addition there 
 is a catholic boarding school a hospital maintains by the anglican mission a fine set of post buildings of the 
 hudson s bay company and many stores of independent traders the o oen coast is reached about fifty miles below 
 aklavik whore tho mackenzie empties into the arctic ocean and while there are numerous channels leading to it the peel 
 channel is the one mostly used as it is easy to follow being clearly defined by high river banks 
 34 twice during the summer the mackenzie river transport calls bringing the year s supply of freight and six times 
 a year planes bring the mail the first boat usually arrives early in july and its arrival is the signal 
 for a gathering of all the trappers indians and eskimos for miles around the r c signals operate a schooner 
 here as it is required for transporting personnel and stores in the summer to herschell island in the arctic ocean 
 where a summer wireless station is maintained it is also used for fishing mainly for food for the station dog 
 team the only meat supply in the delta is the caribou which range in the mountains to the westward the 
 best carcasses dress about eighty pounds in the next article stations in the bear lake area will be described i

 out of a possible 285 the battle practices went very well and a short description of these follows the rifle 
 individual practice was an assault practice from 200 to 50 yards the rifle section practice was an advance from 600 
 to 100 yards stationary or moving targets appeared at various ranges along the butts at unexpected times staying up for 
 short exposures the targets represented small enemy parties or l a and m g posts exposures were made at times 
 necessitating firing variously from the standing kneeling and lying positions the individual l a practice was a defence exeroise the 
 gun with numbers 1 2 and 3 was in a covered position behind the 300 yards firing point targets were 
 put up for short exposures along the butts simulating small parties of enemy infantry cautiously working their way forward in 
 attack the section l a practice was an advance from 700 to 300 yards short exposures of targets were made 
 and ranges requiring varied use of the gun with and without field mount and rifles an enemy counterattack 0:counter 0:attack 
 was simulated by a number of figure 2 targets on sleds being drawn from behind cover

 night fire control and discipline several methods of indirect fire were carried out by the platoon commander and the senior 
 n c os with good results during firing the platoon commander n c os observers and range takers were exercised 
 in observation with and without field glasses and range takers were exercised in field duties the walker cup m g 
 competition was fired on 14th june while we failed to equal last year s score we are satisfied that our
