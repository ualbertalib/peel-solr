 1 the patrician 1995 colonel in chief princess patricia s canadian light infantry the countess mountbatten of burma cbe cd 
 jp dl message from the colonel in chief 1995 was a year of continuing change for our regiment it sometimes 
 seems no sooner do we get used to implementing changes than they are overtaken by others it would amaze me 
 with what fortitude cheerfulness and determination these changes are undertaken and faced if i did not well know the versatility 
 and inventiveness of my patricias of every rank i was particularly pleased this year to be able to visit third 
 battalion in chilliwack and to see them so well installed there after the sad move from victoria alas that move 
 has proved only an interlude in the new art of running a 10 90 battalion and new moves to edmonton 
 and a different battalion conformation to a light battalion are on the programme my husband and i were very pleased 
 to join the association agm in kentville and also to see something of that interesting part of the country before 
 our brief visit to vancouver and victoria and taking the train to edmonton joined by my niece india hicks i 
 was very proud to be at the inauguration of the first patricia parachute company and to know that all the 
 training and skills of our members of the sadlydemised 0:sadly 0:demised airborne regiment would be put once more to very 
 good service a short visit to first battalion in calgary brought our tour to an end with the realization that 
 a move to edmonton in the future will also occur there i look forward to being with second battalion in 
 winnipeg next year and do sympathise with their disappointment at not being deployed to bosnia after all their preparations where 
 i had hoped to visit them my overall impression this year remains as always my patricias are well able to 
 surmount any difficulties placed in their way and to keep up the reputation for excellence which has been hard earned 
 by over three generations of patricias 
 the patrician 1995 2 colonel of the regiment princess patricia s canadian light infantiy major general c w hewson cmm 
 cd message from the colonel of the regiment i am pleased to be able to write this forward to the 
 patrician and to congratulate all members of the regiment on having successfully concluded another momentous year in 1995 notable events 
 include the standing up of the ppcli parachute company the decision to reconstitute 3ppcli as a full regular force battalion 
 and the formation of the wainwright branch of the ppcli association also notable but received with much less enthusiasm was 
 the announcement of the government s decision to close two of canada s finest garrisons currie barracks and base chilliwack 
 in an effort to further reduce infrastructure costs first battalion will relocate to edmonton in 1997 and currie barracks will 
 close after more than sixty years of colourful history current plans are for the regimental hq and museum to remain 
 in calgary after two remarkably successful years in its 10 90 role the third battalion is to assume a new 
 role in the summer of 1996 when it reforms as a light battalion it will relocate to edmonton and incorporate 
 the parachute company equipped on light scales it will be capable of mounting an airborne combat team or an airmobile 
 battle group reinforcements are being provided to the third battalion from first and second battalions and the battle school has 
 responded well to the need to augment all three battalions congratulations to the second battalion on having won both the 
 hamilton gault trophy and the skill at arms trophy having trained hard for duty in bosnia and achieving a high 
 level of operational fitness it was a disappointment for the battalion to be stood down when the un protection force 
 was replaced by the nato implementation force plans are well advanced for the celebration on 28 30 june 1996 of 
 the 45th anniversary of 2 ppcli s heroic stand at the battle of kapyong the association annual general meeting will 
 be held in winnipeg in conjunction with this event like many of you i am numbed by the continued repercussions 
 of the somalia inquiry and its exploitation by a media hungry for sensational news phase two of the inquiry will 
 enable the good work performed in somalia by canadians in the distribution of food and medical aid and in the 
 reconstruction of hospitals and schools to be highlighted there will however also be some ugly information which will no doubt 
 receive media attention morale in the canadian forces already fragile through the pressure of downsizing will be further weakened in 
 contrast to the general state of the canadian forces i have found morale in the regiment to be high and 
 i expect it to continue so the units are gainfully employed and well led they have a sense of purpose 
 and direction they are also strengthened by eighty one years of valiant history in the final analysis that regimental spirit 
 which was our strength at frezenberg kapyong and during other crises will continue to be our strength in 1996

 the patrician 1995 13 first battalion princess patricia s canadian light infantry exercise roving gander 96 it s winter time 
 again and we all know what that means wintex for 1 ppcli this meant company level training this year this 
 requires that company commanders and seconds in command retire to their office for several mind numbing hours of planning training 
 logistics transport timetables costs benefits and ammo expenditures all for a handful of hours of fun in the snow seriously 
 though each company planned something very different with the combined goal of reviewing and teaching winter skills to the troops 
 bravo company planned tank hunting raids and charlie company tracked down the ever popular terrorist group alpha company s original 
 scenario envisioned assistance to the rcmp but this was cancelled when the helicopters were unable to insert more than one 
 platoon something to do with the difficulty flying with frosted windshields in any case exercise roving gander where do they 
 get these names was to take us to new heights in this year s hel ops training minus the choppers 
 of course although two platoon did get to fly those of us in one and three hey why is that 
 police helicopter circling us pies hoddinott jacobi schneider and gauclet 
 the patrician 1995 14 platoons moved by road to our patrol bases near sibbald flats with our lips sore from 
 making helicopter noises although one platoon arrived in slightly over an hour three platoon took the long way upon arrival 
 we set up camp and started the overnight tent routine with a few lectures thrown in three platoon spent most 
 of day two huddled around a fire while being lectured on the intricacies of winter warfare all was going great 
 until our area provincial park employees informed us that we had to leave apparently three days prior to the exercise 
 they had trusted canada post to deliver a letter to the battalion of course the letter outlined the areas that 
 were out of bounds guess where we were pull pole was ordered and so we began to furiously tear down 
 our camp after forty minutes we were on our way we humped along roads and through the flats itself all 
 the while in knee deep snow then off in the distance and getting closer was a trail on a slope 
 that king kong would have struggled with as luck would have it we were heading straight for it we all 
 managed to get up the first two ridges but the third was a killer eventually we were able to climb 
 up and pull the toboggans up from the top it took us over 45 minutes to travel the last 300 
 meters there s got to be an easier way to make a living after mount everest was conquered we stopped 
 on the main road and linked up with the company commander he had taken an easier route with his litis 
 when he stepped out of his vehicle the blast of heat from within could be felt 20 feet away it 
 was later rumoured that several metres of snow in every direction surrounding his tent group was melted from his floor 
 heaters we finally arrived at our destination well after dark we set up camp drove some fresh rations down range 
 and hit the sack company headquarters arrived shortly after and settled down to sending up a really good heat signature 
 one platoon pulled in looking tired but happy two platoon having lost comms and missing the message to move to 
 the road did not arrive until two in the morning looking tired and distinctly unhappy on wednesday day three we 
 worked on survival training we built improvised shelters and winter snow defences as well as continued the by now familiar 
 tent group routine finally day four was end ex we spent the morning doing tent drill races pull pole packed 
 and got ready to go while waiting for our extraction we noticed two of what had to have been the 
 largest floor kerosene heaters ever made standing beside the cq s truck perhaps one day the army will design a 
 toboggan large enough for the rest of us troops to be able to use one in our tent the buses 
 soon arrived and exercise roving gander came to a close all in all it was a worthwhile exercise two platoon 
 learned that mountains affect radio comms one platoon learned there are no fish in the lakes we came out with 
 a good winter warfare review and a solid basis for exercise patricia storm in march just can t wait ptes

 1 chuckled wo arsenault my platoon second in command as he looked me over it was my first time dressed 
 in full winter kit the comment was directed at my pristine white boots freshly issued from clothing stores to the 
 look of confusion that appeared on my face he answered t 1 time in don t worry a winter exercise 
 in suffield will sort it out a winter exercise in suffield many soldiers with boots that have seen a lot 
 of t i quiver just at the thought of it the barren undulating wastelands covered with drifting snow pushed by 
 a relentless arctic wind what a way of getting initiated into the art of winter warfare bravo and charlie companies 
 of 1 ppcli planned a week long exercise in suffield during the first week of december ignoring the caution of 
 meteorologists everywhere ex fix bayonet was to be the culminating point of three weeks of intensive section level and gun 
 crew training every section was to be validated by the company commander maj hitter on mounted and dismounted attacks as 
 well as a night assault originally the exercise had called for live fire validations but due to the lfwa restriction 
 on the use of the c 79 optical sight we had to plan instead for a combination of range practices 
 and dry validations it was 0 dark 30 hours on the 4th of december and i was sitting on the 
 crew commander s jump seat in my grizzly waiting for the road move radio orders i found myself staring at 
 my white boots wondering whether i had brought enough warm clothing knowing that suffield weather is unpredictable and that mother 
 nature reads bravo company s training schedule prior to unleashing the worst she can offer i had stocked up with 
 various pieces of snivel kit it was all easily accessible the weather forecast for our move was gloomy winds picking 
 up temperatures dropping and heavy snow no sooner had the move now been given than the first flakes start to 
 fall by the time we had reached the outskirts of calgary a full blizzard was raging around us visibility was 
 reduced to less than 20 metres and i was cold even though i now had on every piece of my 
 snivel kit crew commanding a grizz left a lot to be desired that morning the wind was merciless as the 
 hours dragged by the convoy ploughed on stopping occasionally amongst blownover 0:blown 0:over tractor trailers because of whiteout conditions or 
 because of the dire need to get coffee into our drivers to thaw them out our perseverance paid off and 
 we pulled into suffield around 1400 hrs we parked outside the base theatre instead of heading to range control and 
 our bivouac site a decision was made due to the poor weather we weren t moving out until the next 
 day almost instantly the theatre was transformed into a sea of people warming up dressing down laying out kit and 
 buying junk food from canex i swear canex has never 
 the patrician 1995 17 seen a more profitable day we were quite comfortable that night munching doritos while watching rob 
 roy on a tv and vcr that the cq had acquired after a hearty breakfast on tuesday we headed off 
 into the charted but often confusing confines of cfb suffield the weather was extremely cold but beautifully clear and calm 
 we found our bivouac site and set up camp after a few practice runs at leaguer drills at the crack 
 of dawn each platoon departed for their own tract of land to set up their ranges and to commence grouping 
 and zeroing good thing we started early we just finished the practice as the sun dipped below the horizon we 
 moved on to completing the night shoot with the light of a full moon reflecting off the fresh snow hitting 
 the targets was not all that difficult to it had been a long day we pulled into the biv with 
 all of our thoughts focused on digging into some nice hot chow administration company had joined us in the field 
 and set up a kitchen and a mess tent unfortunately the heaters in the mess tent were not working quelle 
 surprise we had to speedeat 0:speed 0:eat our mystery meat combo before the gravy froze so much for the hot 
 chow even the condiments were frozen mustard and ketchupsicles wednesday dawned cold and windy breakfast consisted of cf issue eggs 
 any style and frozen beans it was too cold to defrost them properly the mess tent was abandoned since the 
 generator had broken down in the night meaning it now had no lights and no heat without lights it would 
 have been hard to find the frozen ketchup to add colour and flavour to my frozen beans and rapidly cooling 
 eggs but i knew that the cq wo markey always had heat in his tent at least i dined in

 jungle lanes ironic name considering it was 33 c with not a tree in sight these included lanes in ravines 
 gurkha lanes and an obstacle course range excellent training throughout but we were not done yet after a quick haybox 
 supper we carried on with running our sections through a defensive position shoot before being validated on their night assault 
 skills the training had paid off everybody passed the first test thursday brought us no relief from the mess tent 
 problem a rumour was going around explaining the situation something about the generators being designed for the air force who 
 were not known to frequent isolated training areas where the temperature hovered around the stupidly cold mark for weeks at 
 a time thursday also found us coping with howling winds and blowing snow blizzard conditions and a minus 65 c 
 wind chill after consulting my platoon commanders aide memoire for hints on how to deal with the extreme cold find 
 shelter and do not place tongue on metal objects the company set off to finish their training the plan called 
 for everybody to go through muskrat range a range littered with obstacles simulating the approach to an enemy s main 
 defensive area and to finish section validations with mounted and dismounted attacks the cold and wind caused some problems soldiers 
 were getting frostbite only moments after escaping the relative comfort of the grizzlies and visibility hovered around 25 50 metres 
 but we carried on and accomplished our goals every section passed their validations and completed muskrat the company

 peacekeeping termed cooperative nugget 95 at the us joint readiness training centre jrtc fort polk louisiana the aim of the 
 exercise which ran from 6 8 august 1995 was to foster inter operability between the participating military forces through the 
 practice of combined peacekeeping and humanitarian relief operations cooperative nugget 95 was the sixth military exercise to be conducted as 
 part of nato s partnership for peace program it was the first to be conducted in the united states and 
 bravo company was there to show the rest of the world how canadians do business in a peacekeeping role bravo 
 company under the command of major d g hirter trained aggressively in the specific peacekeeping tasks they would face during 
 cooperative nugget 95 including vehicle check points reaction to sniper yip protection mine clearance securing a vital point occupying an 
 observation post and vehicle convoy escorts following a month of workup training the company found itself in the backwoods of 
 louisiana where temperatures of 35c and 90 humidity were the norm the company was divided in two troops a troop

 three week exercise comprised of two weeks of joint training and rehearsals which the americans called situational training exercises or 
 stxs canadians called them silly training in extremely easy tasks and a one week realistic exercise in the field ftx 
 by the end of the stx training the two canadian platoons finished on top of the 24 platoons participating earning 
 the respect of everyone by demonstrating exceptional effort and professionalism throughout without doubt the company was ready to confront any 
 opfor terrorists refugees or belligerents who might interfere with their mission during the ftx following an air insertion into the 
 area of operations and despite the destruction of the company hq in a terrorist suicide truck bomb attack the canadian 
 company completed seven days of quick reaction force vehicle check point observation post and patrolling tasks back at the fort 
 polk main camp a well deserved rest followed the company then spent a day at the astro world in houston 
 texas and two days r r in new orleans most survived one night on world famous bourbon street in retrospect 
 the exercise was well organized somewhat different and interesting in its own way the language barrier proved to be less 
 problem than anticipated with translators and linguistics provided by us army special forces and with national interpreters accompanying each of 
 the foreign troop contingents everyone quickly adapted and were able to understand each other in no time the experience gained 
 in this exercise was very valuable sharing our military knowledge with soldiers from other countries made cooperative nugget 95 a

 cfb suffield during the last week in march and the first week in april we packed kit for every season 
 of the year if you know southern alberta well you know how bad the weather can be at that time 
 of the year as it turned out the battalion conducted two weeks of company level training in every kind of 
 weather on the first day we started with freezing rain that soon turned to snow as the temperature dropped to 
 15 c mid way through the exercise a day began at a sunny 15 c turned to freezing rain and

 republic of yugoslavia fry to assist in the withdrawal of un forces there as part of a nato contingency force 
 the battalion was tasked with cop cobra until july when the second battalion rcr took over the contingency operation called 
 for nato to walk softly and carry a big stick we were to have talked our way into the fry 
 as far as possible and to only resort to force when our freedom of movement was challenged by one of 
 the belligerent forces the exercise started with a road move in company groups into defendable company assembly areas from which 
 company training was conducted the first three days consisted of progressive live fire ranges pairs section and then platoon company 
 training then progressed through a series of combat operations defence of a vital point relief in place hasty defence rearward

 the newly formed and still dismounted delta company conducted company live fire advance to contact and a deliberate attack dismounted 
 for the remainder of the training delta company participated as a dismounted company in the midst of a mechanized battalion 
 this turned out to be quite a learning experience in coordinating troop lift with battalion transport as the vehicles used 
 to move the company were the same ones needed to conduct battalion resupply the commander of 1 cmbg visited delta 
 company on one particularly miserable night when live fire section night attacks had to be cancelled because the freezing sideways 
 rain and sleet prevented troops from communicating with their fire team partners bgen cox then visited the company position while 
 the troops settled into their shellscrapes and hootchies building hootchies in treeless cfb suffield takes some imagination which all members 
 of the battalion demonstrated every steel or wooden picket not on a range had a shelter half secured to it 
 the favourite solution was to dig deeper than the required shellscrape depth bury three sides of the hootchie and then 
 heat it with a mountain stove of which there were no shortage in delta company some members of the company 
 had the advantage of being able to occupy old british trenches located on their position deep enough to be below 
 the frostline and therefore warmer bgen cox stayed the night and shared breakfast with the company served up by our 
 much appreciated cooks and their field kitchen another notable visit to the unit was by the minister of national defence 
 and his entourage this visit provided the opportunity for all concerned to meet the minister and take part in a

 the patrician 1995 27 army training sir whether it s called warrior lfca style individual battle task standards or the 
 new and improved warrior simply put it s refresher training it s the same thing an infantry battalion like 1 
 ppcli has been doing year after year however now it has a name badges and it s army wide the 
 army has always had standards for basic training leadership training advanced courses and even a standard to which our officers 
 are trained but never a common minimum standard that every soldier even non infantrymen must maintain this formalized refresher training 
 takes on even greater importance in the current climate of fiscal restraint as the well of dollars dries up the 
 ability to maintain an operationally effective army becomes increasingly more difficult it you are at the minimum standard then why 
 waste time and resources refreshing what you already know instead take that time those resources and do some continuation training 
 the bottom line is that warrior is a good thing for the army as a whole and with some improvements 
 will become even better regardless of what you may think an order is an order with the ink not even 
 dry on the 1 cmbg implementation plan 1 ppcli got on with the task at hand that being to conduct 
 warrior validation combat support company with the emphasis on support got the nod to run the training for the battalion 
 all platoons in the company were tasked to one degree or another anti armour platoon an the dry weapons validation 
 mortar platoon conducted the c 7 range signal platoon the communications stand and so forth all companies rotated through the 
 various stands until their validation check list was complete a little more than a week was required to validate the 
 majority of the battalion less the stragglers and combat support another series of stands were set up to accomplish this 
 task this time however with some assistance from the rifle companies with the first round of validation complete the only 
 thing left to do is wait for our warrior badges and carry on with whatever the next battle task standard 
 book says we should do for those that managed to avoid the process this time don t panic i guarantee 
 that you ll have another chance capt k p barker

 peace triangle as it was known was hosted by the polish peacekeeping centre in kielce poland as part of nato

 the contingent which included a full rifle company multinational headquarters staff and company commander and sergeant major as observers were 
 experienced peacekeepers having served in the former yugoslavia the company s task was to establish a zone of separation between

 within 24 hours the company was ainning like a well oiled machine there s nothing like a common challenge to 
 draw people together quickly and the exercise directing staff made sure the challenge was there there were no canned orders 
 and there were real time problems to solve throughout the exercise there were ongoing cultural exchanges from soccer matches to

 30 the patrician 1995 officer senior nco hockey game 95 the true definition of manoeuvre warfare theory the overall style 
 of hockey as displayed by the officers team their aim was to dislocate disrupt and disorient the enemy destroying his 
 cohesion rather than destroying him pieceby piece 0:piece 0:by 0:piece with firepower skill the commander coach created successive unexpected and 
 threatening situations for the opponent the enemy was made to see his situation not just as unfavourable losing or deteriorating 
 losing bad but rather as deteriorating at an ever increasing pace the skates were sharp the eyes focused the ice 
 cold this was it the chance the first battalion officers had been waiting for the chance to redeem themselves after 
 years of defeat by the ncos the officers knew that the competition was going to be tough sgt kerr had 
 the nco s practicing long and hard prior to the big game the officers were unable to locate the damn 
 arena even after expert instructions from the qmsi the ncos were sure that once again they would pull off an 
 easy win and confirm that the officers would hold on to the horse s ass trophy for another year the 
 officers strategic plan however was to show no interest in the practices and concentrate all their efforts on the application 
 of manoeuvre warfare theory through effective intelligence preparation of the battlefield ipb the officers discovered that the key to victory 
 was to concentrate not on the commanding officer shows the duffer line how hockey is played 
 the patrician 1995 31 the rsm prepares to slop the commanding officer s breakaway the co has not been heard 
 from since the ground ice puck and net but on the enemy s weak link his large number of players 
 thus the officers opening gambit was to ensure as many ncos as possible took to the ice consequently the really 
 good enemy players could only play one shift per period the officers firm grasp of the principals of schwerpunkt was 
 a major element of their glorious victory while the ncos had done their own ipb and had knowledge of the 
 officers devilish plan they could not prevent the inevitable led by the duffer line the enemy centre of gravity was 
 quickly destroyed by the officers team almost immediately the ncos decision making cycle was overloaded by the officers who had 
 spend close to one week studying the theory of manoeuvre warfare the final outcome was close the nco s lost 
 the lead and eventually the game in a well played and exciting match however as in the falkland islands and 
 later in the persian gulf pure combat power proved no match against sound intelligence and the skilled application of manoeuvre 
 warfare so once again the horse s ass trophy is in the possession of its rightful owners lt d r

 ripley minnesota the battalion also bid farewell to one dco major pete hofman and welcomed a new one maj grant 
 mcnally unfortunately the most significant events of 1995 were the cancellation of b company s un deployment to yugoslavia with 
 ircha and the cancellation of the battalion s second tour with unprofor three weeks before the advance party was due 
 to depart for visoko these deployments would have been the culmination of months of pre deployment training nonetheless all elements 
 of the battalion did achieve a very high state of preparedness and maintained that state through the months ending 1995

 through and pass through firing the c 7 c 9 and c 6 as part of the battle group s 
 preparation for deployment to bosnia wo harris sgt stewart and all the cpl ptes of delta endured the hottest summer 
 in a decade to ensure that the battalion was checked out and qualified as opposed to when delta coy fired 
 its own pwt in the rain wind and cold of october and still achieved more than 90 marksman delta company 
 then deployed to fort ripley minnesota on 6 september 1995 to undertake preparations for the battle group s predeployment test 
 exercise prairie thunder before departure for bosnia during the three week exercise delta company was responsible for setting up various 
 live fire ranges and then became the belligerent force for the final phase of the exercise upon return from exercise 
 prairie thunder the battalion s upcoming un tour to bosnia was cancelled as a result a large shift in personnel

 and the air force detachment staff welcoming all in all we were lucky lucky like the mounties at duck lake 
 the summer was a typical prairie summer hot and dusty with no strip joints hard work was the norm the 
 six day work weeks took care of that and in the end over 800 troops had been trained to ibts 
 operational level selected for un duty and trained on a ql 4 course no no don t thank us we 
 were happy to do it we kept ourselves amused by reading dickens well there were lots of stories about the 
 artful dodger visiting the local patricia holding homecoming celebrations don t ask who the queen was and participating in the 
 best darned sports days ever planned the spirit of camaraderie was unequalled just ask anyone about mountain bike polo all 
 in all when the last member of 3 ppcli dried their eyes and left dundurn on 9 september we could 
 all say whew was that you were you at buds again last night good bye to the 12 o clock

 the patrician 1995 72 administration company in 1995 the year 1995 was one of change and diversity for adm coy 
 several new key players arrived including a new oc major tom stinson a new 2ic capt hans brink and a 
 new transport officer lieutenant mike bourgeois these personnel changes occurred in what has perhaps been the most hectic year that 
 administration company has seen in years following its deployment on a very successful exercise cougar salvo in fort lewis washington 
 the company was tasked as part of 3 ppcli to deploy to mtd dundurn for the next five months the 
 company supported the establishment and operation of the united nations area courses including fmc driver wheel and tracked courses support 
 platoon courses supply courses infantry battle task standard training and various other courses naturally this could not have been accomplished 
 without the substantial augmentation by the reservists of lfwa following our redeployment to cfb chilliwack in august 1995 and a 
 wellexecuted 0:well 0:executed rail move i might add administration company plunged ahead with exercise savage terrier 111 this entailed light 
 operations at the platoon and section level and focused on providing the reservists attending the exercise with a basic understanding 
 of how the subunits operate in the field this ex was very successful due largely to the hard work of 
 the soldiers involved capt hans brink testing the allowable uv rays

 tone delivering the message you have thirty seconds to log off before system shut down has become a rarely required 
 warning mary lou came back to work after delivering hillary and is now sharing her job as the co s 
 secretary with a newcomer to the school yvette rice headquarters moved back into building 185 after the renovations were completed 
 noted that it was a job well done then spent the latter part of 1995 busily making changes to the 
 floor plan thus requiring more renovations to be done training support company is still called that the school s stores 
 are still centralized the recruit tap turned off again for the last half of the year cwo scott remained retired 
 but also became the president by unanimous vote of the new wainwright branch of the ppcli association perhaps the most 
 significant event of the year for the school anyway was the arrival of lcol austdal as our new co however 
 being that he is a most unpretentious man 1 will dwell on him no further three officers made the fine 
 up for adjutant in 1995 starting with doug oliphant who threw the torch back to malcolm bruce in april so 
 he could be 2ic mtsc malcolm in turn tossed it to me david marshall in june upon his posting to

 event which shouldn t be missed during my initial week as the new co marches past

 the patrician 1995 79 ql3 inf 9413 rimini line the bad boys battle school for basic training a look of 
 pity came across her face as she raised her right hand to cross me the way a priest does when 
 giving the dying his last rights you poor guy she said shaking her head with an all knowing smile at 
 the time i wondered why she had done that and my fears and curiosity of the training to come reached 
 a new level i looked at one of the other recruits with a look of horror on my face and 
 swallowed hard yikes i exclaimed as a fog seemed to roll across his face i now know why i was 
 blessed we arrived at the battle school at approximately 1500 hours the friday before our course was to start we 
 were marched to the building that would be our home for the next 11 weeks and after a wonderful meal 
 yech in the mess and some unpacking headed to bed it would be a few days before the course would 
 start enough time to clean the shacks and have the other recants arnve as i lay in bed that night 
 i wondered what was to come in the weeks ahead and remembered that the recruiting officer had told me that 
 i would get weekends off have no late nights get no verbal encouragement and not have to do pushups 0:push 
 0:ups for excitement i wonder now if she had ever gone to the battle school or if she was just 
 bending the facts a little either way i was already here and would find out soon enough our first week 
 of training consisted of classroom work getting our kit organized push ups drill and more push ups each day began 
 with our morning pt at the end of which our platoon commander gave us an order to have a nice 
 day i remember thinking to myself that i would get right on that in between classes push ups inspections and 
 more push ups the recruits of ql 2 3 reserve infantry course serial 9503 started to get to know one 
 another we found out who the slackers were who the hard workers were and discovered what an mir commando was 
 otherwise known as the sick lame and lazy we tried to learn how to march and do drill properly we 
 heard new sayings like get moving and assume the position we learned that if you said yup to one of 
 the instructors the response was usually i ll yup you alright 
 80 the patrician 1995 and that it was to be avoided no matter how smart we thought we were we 
 found out we could be put to the test very quickly especially during drill we started saying things like soldier 
 on and good to go we learned that if you were taught something once you had better do it right 
 or be faced with remedial pt push ups as the weeks rolled on we slowly started to get our collective 
 acts together we learned that being an individual would get you nowhere and that pt gets easier as you get 
 into shape we learned how to roll socks press shirts fold towels polish boots and all the other aspects of 
 being a garrison soldier we winning the fire fight safety during a live fire section attack 
 the patrician 1995 81 had yet however to learn much about being an infantry soldier that changed when we started 
 our weapons training the days spent on the ranges were some of the best yet we each discovered that deep 
 down inside we knew how to fire a rifle properly even though we did our best to prove ourselves wrong 
 through patience trial and error and some good coaching all of us passed our personal weapons test and moved on 
 to learn the other weapons that would help us to become effective members of the infantry the days passed we 
 overcame the obstacles that were put in front of us only more often than not finding higher ones on the 
 other side we watched members of our platoon get sent home for medical or training reasons while others joined half 
 way through the course we began to see a small dim light at the end of the long tunnel and 
 when it looked as though we would get our weekend blue passes we looked forward to friday like a starving 
 man does food we then of course lived through adventures on the weekends that generally left us feeling worse on 
 sunday than we had on friday the training continued and each of us dug deeper into our personal resources to 
 complete our assigned tasks i remember specifically during our 13 km march and shoot when three members of our platoon 
 aimed back at the 10 km mark to go and help those who had fallen catch up and finish with 
 the rest of us i saw the spirit of teamwork and pride in one s platoon that is a vital 
 part of the infantry because of that i now know what mission before self really means time goes on like 
 it always does and our days turned into weeks and our weeks into months we were nearing the end of 
 the course and it was time to look back and evaluate what it was we had learned we learned to 
 work as a team to help our buddies when they need us and how to be effective individuals when called 
 to do so we learned how to push our bodies and to drive ourselves when we feel like quitting we 
 learned a lot about ourselves and our capabilities we learned that we have a lot to learn of the things 
 we will take home from this course aside from the skills we have learned the most important will be the 
 names and faces of the people we have trained with we have seen the best and worst in each other 
 and i consider each one of these people to be my friend while the end of the course could not 
 come soon enough i will miss each of the people i have met here recruits and instructors alike in their 
 own way each has left their mark on me and they will not soon be forgotten pte shay d a

 it was cancelled for 1995 due to a lack of candidates this course is planned again for the summer of 
 1996 as with the saic run in gagetown for our regular force infantrymen this course is critical for the development 
 of our reserve force infantrymen sniper the basic sniper course was again successful this year graduating a total of five 
 new snipers it is one of the most demanding courses at the battle school preparing candidates for employment as a 
 unit sniper with the deployments of lfwa units to the former republic of yugoslavia there was an urgent requirement for 
 qualified snipers despite the scaling back of un deployments it is understood that units will continue to require trained snipers

 really is infantry training assistance team the infantry training assistance team has been responsible for the seven reserve infantry units 
 in western area this does not include the four bc reserve infantry units yet the first half of the year 
 the 1994 95 training year was dedicated to the offence and the second half the 1995 96 training year to 
 the defence one of these days we really should amalgamate the training fiscal and calendar years with the team being 
 responsible for units as far a way as the lake superior scottish regiment of thunder bay to the loyal edmonton 
 
 the patrician 1995 b 9 regiment of edmonton of course and all the units in between they spent the majority 
 of their time on the road hitting thunder bay shilo dundurn and our own back yard it observed reserve infantry 
 units go through their paces we expect the team s reclassification requests to css trades in any day now as 
 the css training assistance team goes to more exotic and warm locales such as vancouver island chilliwack and fort lewis 
 the original mtsc concept of centralized expertise centralized equipment and centralized training seems to have undergone some minor evolution it 
 is now the exception rather than the mle that units conduct their training in wainwright the infantry team consisted of 
 capt steve boyne team leader wo kevin kehoe team 2ic plus the occasional stand in such as wo linville wo 
 simon and sgt gebhardt a variety of reserve augmentees from across western area were employed as drivers and the ever 
 resourceful fantasian enemy force throughout 1995 the team conducted a total of 21 reserve collective training exercises armoured assistance team 
 the armoured training assistance team was responsible to the king s own calgary regiment the south alberta light horse and 
 the british columbia dragoons on the armoured side and the fort garry horse the saskatchewan dragoons and the british columbia 
 regiment on the armoured reconnaissance side as with the infantry team the armoured reconnaissance the sole bctcandidate taking a much 
 needed break 
 the patrician 1995 90 team spent much of its time on the road between winnipeg mb chilliwack bc and ft 
 lewis wa the armoured team on the other hand did not do much travelling as the reserve armoured units came 
 to wainwright where the cougars have been centralized the high point of the team s year and the high point 
 of the year for the mtsc as a whole was hosting the worhtington cup 1995 competition this armoured unit competition 
 picks the best regiment in canada unfortunately the winner was not a western area regiment but the exercise was a 
 complete success for all concerned and was the culmination of the collective training year the armoured training assistance team consisted 
 for the first half of the year of capt darryl bridgeman bcd wo brian talty ldsh rc and wo tony 
 batty salh with a variety of reserve augmentees as drivers and enemy force the team was expanded during the second 
 half of the year with the posting in of capt clayton fifield ldsh ro all told they conducted 18 armoured 
 collective training exercises during 1995 engineer training assistance team during the latter half of 1995 the mtsc was given the 
 responsibility of conducting reserve collective training for western area engineer units these were 6 field engineer squadron vancouver 44 field 
 engineer squadron trail 8 field engineer regiment edmonton and 33 field engineer squadron calgary the units conducted their training in 
 both wainwright and chilliwack with the team travelling as required the training assistance team consisted of our lone engineer wo 
 nick hedley as a one man show augmented by reservists as required wo hedley did a total of three mtsc 
 training weekends for the engineers during the latter half of the year combat service support training assistance team the final 
 training assistance team to comprise the company was the combat service support team this team was given the responsibility during 
 the latter half of the year to conduct reserve collective training for the bc and alberta service battalions and medical 
 companies specifically 11 service battalion and medical company victoria 12 service battalion and medical company vancouver 14 service battalion calgary 
 and 15 service battalion and medical company edmonton they conducted their training in wainwright fort lewis wa and chilliwack with 
 the team travelling as required the css training assistance team consisted of capt erik liebert who was cross posted into

 patricias and for many the usual headaches of a major posting were amplified with the order to establish a brand 
 new unit yet despite the sacrifices adjustments and growing pains of the ppcli parachute company the potential for a great 
 unit was born initially only 63 personnel the parachute company evolved dramatically in a short 7 month period expanding to 
 over 140 all ranks under the command of major lan hunt though essentially a rifle company a support platoon heavy 
 with recce and pathfinder elements reflected the impending expansion into the new light infantry battalion a substantial headquarters group composed 
 of support trades and a dedicated ops training cell also contributed to the unit s larger size despite limited equipment 
 the company wasted little time in launching into a relatively busy training schedule of pt field skill reconfirmation and con 
 para highlights included an official standup ceremony in september and a november sovereignty deployment by parachute insertion into the frozen

 surface the para company s enemy force tasking to support 3 ppcli and western area reservists was seen as an 
 opportunity to sharpen pi and coy battle drills however the paras soon realized it was also a test to see 
 how much of the wainwright training area could be covered by foot the first 17 km brought the company to 
 the edge of the 3 ppcli bivouac for western challenge where hoochies were set up patrol and quick attack skills 
 were practiced by platoons and recce skills were honed quietly against other units in the area pioneers made rope bridges

 108 the patrician 1995 dalaghuri 26 400p1us ft no written information was given on the history of the rna mountain 
 warfare school however we were able to piece together a general overview sometime during 1974 the rna had numerous border 
 disputes with china the nepalese boarder with tibet is difficult to monitor and tibetan refugees moved freely into nepal the 
 chinese wanted this to stop and some threats were made by the chinese regarding the possibility of their soldiers taking 
 action in nepalese territory in an effort to prepare their army for the possibility of chinese troops moving across their 
 borders the rna established the mountain warfare school in kesang in the event of any military mountain operations against the 
 chinese the rna would have experienced mountain troops to work with other allied nations the rna began inviting other countries 
 to participate on their exercise sometimes in the late 1980s it is not known if this was initially intended to 
 allow allied nations the opportunity of having experienced advisors who would assist on any future operations to date the school 
 runs a seven month long basic and advanced mountain warfare operations course the foreign students are involved in the last 
 two weeks of the course expedition details preparation in kathmanclu took two days briefings were given by maj rana on 
 the training program and equipment requirements the team packed and prepared their personal kit for the approach trek to the 
 mountain school and expedition kit for air transport for the approach hike our packs weighed around 60 lbs the lighter 
 load was necessary to allow the team to cover the 130 kms 
 109 the patrician 1995 base camp 16 500 ft distance in four days as opposed to nine days and to 
 make acclimatization easier the equipment required for the approach was dothing sleeping bag and other personal items one would require 
 for an overnight hike the rest of our expedition equipment was air transported to the school prior to our departure 
 bgen ptjb rana director of military training dmt was introduced to all team members he welcomed us to nepal and 
 talked to us about their course and was very inquisitive about our country s mountain operations he was especially interested 
 in the possibility of sending rna mountain instructors to attend the canadian moi course finally the expedition started with an 
 8 hour bus ride from kathmandu to pokhara pokhara is located in the west of nepal and is the staging 
 area for all major expeditions in the area the walk from pokhara to jomsom according to the guide book is 
 a 9 day walk however the team took only four days maj rana wo pasang norbu sherpa who reached the 
 summit of mt everest on an rna expedition a medic and a rna moi accompanied us for the walk to 
 the school accommodation for the walk in was at guest houses which were mostly two story stone houses with dormitory 
 rooms all meals were prepared by the locals and for the most part the food was very westernised due the 
 large number of tourists who trek in the area the total distance covered over the four days was 130 km 
 the total altitude climbed was difficult to determine accurately however the team gained and lost over an estimated 12 000 
 ft upon our arrival at jomsom we were introduced to capt dahal and some instructors from the school once again 
 our accommodation was in a guest 
 110 the patrician 1995 house that evening there was a dinner at the guest house with the co and all 
 the officers from the school the following day the co introduced all the instructors and gave us an overview of 
 the training the rna mountain warfare course is seven months long the advanced and basic courses run concurrently the course 
 is made up of a company size group of officers and other ranks the co s briefing included a demonstration 
 of all cliff techniques which included climbing cliff evacuation suspension traverse fixed rope climbing and rappelling all visitors were given 
 the opportunity to participate and according to the co our group was the first to ascend the 1 000 ft 
 cliff using the fixed ropes all demonstrations were done by the students who were on the final two weeks of 
 their course for the next four days a combination of acclimatization climbs with a day of glacier training took place 
 the first day involved a steep hike up to the kesang training school at 11 000 ft at this point 
 in time we were now carrying full equipment which was around 70 80 lbs the coy which is stationed year 
 round at the training school is responsible for conducting the mountain course operations in the area and providing visitors with 
 tactical demonstrations 0:demonstra 0:tions the oc gave us an introduction and narrated a live fire section assault involving rappelling and 
 ascending fixed ropes for the duration we stayed in a small camp at 12 000 ft in two man tents 
 the camp csm wo pasang norbu sherpa and a section of rna soldiers prepared all our meals most of the 
 food at this point was rice soup with sheep goat or yak meat the following 3 days included glacier demonstrations 
 related to ice climbing glacier travel various rescue procedures and tactical operations all of this training involved walking and climbing 
 to 15 000 ft and required a solid technical ability to reach some of throung la peak summit 21 000

 returned to the guest house in jomsom to organised our equipment and packed our ruck sacks for the approach march 
 to thorang peak base camp the climb to thorang peak base camp at 17 500 ft from jomsom took three 
 days thorang peak is 21 000 ft high for this phase the rna students were divided into two groups the 
 first group climbed the peak the day prior and fixed the ropes on the steep sections of the route the 
 following day our ascent of the mountain started at 0400 hrs with our group taking the lead in front of 
 the rna students each country was assigned an rna instructor to climb with us on a rope team of three 
 the initial 800 ft of climbing was steep snow and ice the majority of the climbing was of moderate difficulty 
 however the altitude very quickly began to take effect from 19 000 to 21 000 ft our movement was slow 
 and very deliberate the usual headache was also part of the experience the summit was reached at 1000 hrs and 
 team pictures were taken the descent took only 2 hrs we arrived in jomsom two days later and upon our 
 arrival we were congratulated 0:congratu 0:lated by the co in way of appreciation sgt sheppard and i presented the ppcli 
 flag which we flew on the summit of the mountain to the co he was very surprised and most appreciative 
 of our gesture the next day we flew from jomsom by helicopter to pokhara and fixed wing to kathmandu in 
 total the team covered over 300 km ascended 30 000 ft and descended 28 000 ft in only 14 days 
 seven of the eight team members made it to the summit to date this is a first for the cf 
 on any international expedition and the highest summit any members of the cf have climbed 
 the patrician 1995 112 finally the magnitude and scale of the mountaineering in nepal are immense and the future possibility 
 of a canadian moi being part of an international army expedition of an 28 000 ft peak is one we 
 would not be able to accomplish on our own the potential for positive media coverage from an expedition of this 
 magnitude would be significant captain r pettigrew annapurna left and annapurna south right 26 400p1us ft north face throung la

 the patrician 1995 128 patricias down under major pat stogran with fellow tactics instructors and members of the royal australian 
 regiment majors lain cruickshank left and luke carroll right the patricias have once again secured one of the premier exchange 
 positions for cfcsc qualified majors at the australian army land warfare centre in canungra queensland while many other exchanges might 
 offer comparable professional challenges an exchange in the southern hemisphere is indeed unique both culturally and geo politically formed in 
 november of 1942 primarily for training reinforcements for the war in the pacific the centre has a proud history of 
 training australian and allied forces for conflict thousands of troops trained in canungra saw action in wwii against japanese forces 
 later during the emergencies in malaya and borneo and again in the vietnam war the original concept was that men 
 should live and train under conditions as near as possible to those of active service although 
 the patrician 1995 129 the former jungle training centre has changed its name and expanded its focus the same rigorous 
 attention to no nonsense training has been retained the land warfare centre is made up of two major training establishments 
 and two lodger units tactics wing where the canadian exchange position rests is responsible for training army officers in formation 
 level tactics and operational staff procedures warrant officer and nco wing conducts training for all of the ncos in the 
 army in leadership and administration lodger units in the garrison include the army s school of military intelligence and battle 
 wing which in the style of batus rotates infantry companies of the royal australian regiment rar through comprehensive serialized training 
 in dismounted operations the position of formation tactics instructor with the tactics wing is one of the more sought after 
 places of employment by staff trained australian army majors and as such attracts some extremely talented officers the breadth of 
 training that canadian officers normally have in mechanized operations within a brigade and their familiarity with nato doctrine and procedures 
 makes them particularly well suited for such employment traditionally canadian exchange officers are employed as tactics instructors on courses that 
 are aimed at defensive and offensive operations at the brigade level and above these courses set aside operational staff procedures 
 which are the subject of other courses conducted in the wing in order to focus purely on tactics in detail 
 while tewts are the main teaching vehicle they are supported by central lectures syndicate discussions and historical presentations for all 
 offensive and defensive operations 0:opera 0:tions students are expected to demonstrate a detailed understanding of australian army doctrine as well 
 as contemporary doctrinal theories expounded in military journals one of the historical battles that is studied by students of tactics 
 wing is kapyong for which 3rar shares 2ppcli s distinction of having been awarded the united states of america presidential 
 citation veterans of the battle are invited to sit in on the central presentation and to take part in the 
 question and answer period that follows upon recognizing my regimental flashes the rar kapyong veterans immediately embraced me demonstrating an 
 affinity for the patricias it was touching to hear their reminiscences about colonel stone who is remembered by the rar 
 members as fondly as if he were one of their own the president of the 3rar association is keen to 
 establish closer links with those patricia s who served with 2ppcli in kapyong kapyong veterans can reach him thus mick

 the patrician 1995 130 for a canadian officer the job of tactics instructor is an excellent sabbatical during which he 
 can immerse himself in the study of contemporary tactics and military history and refine his knowledge of our own doctrine 
 and tactics as the resident subject matter expert as an instructor it is not uncommon to have your own knowledge 
 put to the test by the students who are often of equal and higher rank as a result every course 
 can be extremely stimulating intellectually it is also rewarding to work with so many gifted officers knowing that you may 
 be influencing some of the future power brokers in the australian army notwithstanding the direct professional value of the job 
 the exchange position also exposes canadian officers to the interactions and influences in south east asia canada s interest in 
 the area has been relatively recent by australian standards they have long recognized that their future rests with active participation 
 in the development of this burgeoning region it is difficult for canadians to appreciate the intricacies of becoming a player 
 in the area as it differs in every way from the theatre that we have become familiar with as a 
 nato player in central europe life in australia however gives the opportunity 0:opportu 0:nity to gain valuable insights into the 
 situation while the focus of the australian army may be in a different area of the world we have many 
 things in common the australian defence force is well down the road in total quality management and like ourselves their 
 reserves play an integral part in their force structure the australian experiences in these areas are well worth studying also 
 like ourselves the australian army has demonstrated its competence on peacekeeping and humanitarian missions and many officers have experienced duty 
 with the united nations although as the former yugoslavia is well out of the australian area of interest i am 
 often asked by my colleagues to reflect on our experience there indeed i was privileged to be invited to give 
 a lecture on the leadership challenges that i faced as unmo team leader in gorazde during the serb offensive of 
 april 1994 an event which captured international attention and for which i was mentioned in dispatches to my great delight 
 my presentation was overwhelmingly well received although the tour has only just begun and life in tactics wing is as 
 hectic as any job i ve had before it is clear to me just how much benefit i am receiving 
 by the exchange employment i consider myself to be extremely privileged to have been given the opportunity to network with 
 the officers and men of our allied regiment maj p stogram 
 the patrician 1995 131 a year in pakistan while this is probably the last thing that anyone is interested in 
 reading i believe that as potentially the last patricia to attend the command and staff college in quetta pakistan i 
 want to share a few of my experiences from attending a foreign staff college the reason is twofold initially it 
 is to highlight some of the interesting and challenging aspects of both the country and the course secondly i hope 
 to rekindle some of the fond memories that other patricia graduates have from their year as a student at the 
 staff college let me begin by saying that this was a year like no other i have ever had unlike 
 those officers who attended the toronto staff college wendy and i had well over a year of advance notice for 
 our posting and believe it or not it almost takes that long to complete the necessary screening various country briefs 
 needle parades and other personal administration which includes the placing of your food order for a year supply of various 
 items that are unavailable in pakistan while this last one may sound easy take a second to think about how 
 many bars of soap number of razor blades or tubes of toothpaste do you use in a year pakistan is 
 a unique and interesting place in which to live and this last year has provided both of us with a 
 lifetime of memories quetta is the capital of baluchistan one of the four provinces of pakistan and is the centre 
 for the tribal cultures of the area to say that this area is backward and underdeveloped would be an understatement 
 running water and electricity for many of the citizens are considered luxuries garbage collection off the cantonment is almost nonexistent 
 and the day to day dealing and bartering with the merchants of the city is something that was foreign to 
 many of the foreign students although all our wives seem to get very good at it yet many of the 
 homes even the mud huts seem to have a tv antenna as far as the course is concerned i am 
 aware that there is a feeling that the quetta command and staff college course cannot be compared to the toronto 
 course and that perhaps this was just a cushy posting and with minimal learning value quite the contrary quetta is 
 what you make of it and i believe that in its own way it is just as demanding and or 
 as challenging as the course in toronto or any other foreign course that we attend it is simply a matter 
 of perception while the pakistani army may not have a great deal of funding or resources available they do make 
 every attempt to provide a professionally rewarding and challenging course the 95 staff course offered students the opportunity to exchange 
 views and opinions with officers from 24 different countries it provided for those of us from more modern countries the 
 opportunity to work and live with a totally different army system and structure which operates in an extremely diverse and 
 challenging operational environment their theatre of 
 132 the patrician 1995 operation provides many unique challenges it ranges from desert conditions in the south to extremely high 
 altitudes in the north this further complicate issues the pakistani army is not overly modernized and they are forced to 
 rely on quantity of troops and what we may consider as somewhat outdated tactics these points made the course challenging 
 for many of the foreign students and while faistrating at times it did provide us with an opportunity to critically 
 analyse the tactics training philosophies and leadership techniques that we use in our own countries one of the benefits of 
 attending a foreign staff college is the opportunity that it provides to travel living in the far east provided us 
 with the opportunity to see and experience the cultures and sites of many places that are not normally available to 
 today s canadian army in each of the leave periods available wendy and i took advantage of this unique travel 
 opportunity to visit some of the many historical sites of the region with some help from various agencies and organizations 
 we were able to visit the khyber pass the khyber rifles officers mess the great wall of china mao s 
 tomb the forbidden city tennamin square and the site of the original bridge over the river kwai however the one 
 trip that will always stand out in my mind is the five days we spent in korea and our trip 
 to kapyong after having spent almost 10 years in 2 ppcli i consider myself very lucky to have been afforded 
 this rare opportunity with the help of col acreman armoured corps the cfa in korea we were able to get 
 a car and driver from the embassy and subsequently spent a day touring the battlefield at kapyong and visiting the 
 monuments to the second battalion 3 rar and the other commonwealth soldiers who fought in this battle despite having read 
 most of what is available on the battle and having spoken with some of the veterans the actual layout of 
 the ground gave me a new insight into the conduct of the battle and reinforced my impressions of the enormity 
 of their accomplishment one of the side benefits of the college life was the ability to see some history of 
 the canadian army hanging on the walls walking through the halls of the college you are provided with the opportunity 
 to see the names of all the previous students who have attended this course while many canadians dating back to 
 early 1900 s have attended this course it was interesting to note the names of some other patricia s who 
 have spent the year in quetta names like lcol d cottingham lcol w denkhe lcol m fenrich maj s mechbach 
 and maj m english all come to mind and i am sure that they probably have the same fantastic memories 
 from their year in quetta wendy and i consider ourselves to have been very lucky to have been given this 
 opportunity it was a great experience for both of us and i felt it was professionally rewarding in its own 
 way not only do we have some great memories but we also made some wonderful friends from all corners of 
 the world maj cm eckley 
 the patrician 1995 133 gasherbrum ii adventure training at high altitude after stepping through the metal detector and briefly stopping 
 to regain my camera and day pack i raced ahead of the crowd of people moving towards gate 115 at 
 toronto s international airport over the past four months i had lived this moment over and over in my head 
 never once believing that it would really happen as i handed my boarding pass to the stewardess of flight 720 
 to islamabad pakistan my fate at least for the next three months was sealed the military had given me the 
 opportunity to fulfill a lifelong dream i was on my way to climb gasherbrum 11 the 13th highest mountain in 
 the world rising to a height of 26 500 ft 8035 m gasherbrum ii is 6 000 ft higher than 
 north america s tallest mt mckinley and a mere 3 000 ft below mt everest work up trg in smith 
 rocks oregon capt engleshy as the plane lifted off i began to relax in my seat and reflect on the 
 events of the past four months no doubt the other two team members capts mark yarmoshuk and matt barlee did 
 so as well initially relief was the prevailing emotion my thoughts soon drifted however to our pretraining 0:pre 0:training which 
 took place from april to mid may the training included first aid revision and rock climbing in both squamish b 
 c and smith rocks oregon para gliding hiking in chilliwack and a 12 day mini climbing expedition on mt waddington 
 complete with accredited mountain guides all served to make us ready as possible mountain guides to b c s second 
 highest peak mount waddington probably the greatest challenge 0:chal 0:lenge and benefit provided by the training phase was getting used 
 to working closely with the other members of the expedition accentuated by the altitude cold and uncomfortable 0:un 0:comfortable living 
 conditions as the flight progressed over the atlantic we found it amusing that according 0:accord 0:ing to the inflight display 
 we were flying a mere 4 000 ft above our eventual target upon our arrival at the islamabad airport 
 134 the patrician 1995 we were met by lcol klien the defence attache at the canadian high commission and his 
 assistant sgt rudder during our three day stay in islamabad we were introduced to the complexities of pakistani culture and 
 religion and guided through a whirlwind of official dinners meetings and sightseeing tours on 24 may we departed for the 
 pakistan army school of mountain warfare and physical training located in abbottabad there we were introduced to the overall expedition 
 and commandant of the school colonel farooq as well we met with the expedition ground leader lcol pirzada later we 
 met and began the second phase of our pre training with the seven pakistani and three italian army members of 
 the expedition col farooq s initial brief to the team impressed upon us the level of importance their army places 
 on mountain warfare of the only fourteen 26 000 ft 8000 m mountains in the world five are located in 
 pakistan these five giants k2 the world s second highest peak broad peak nanga parbat and gasherbrums i and ii 
 have virtually created the country s large tourist industry each year they draw hundreds of climbers and thousands of trekkers 
 four of these mountains including our objective gasherbrum 11 lay within the disputed area of kashmir which borders india recent 
 history ascertains that the world s highest land battle occurred in the mountains of kashmir between pakistani and indian forces 
 even today the dispute continues and the pakistan army is forced to maintain and operate numerous section size outposts as 
 high as 20 000 ft our training in abbottabad focused on physical fitness and developing communication skills so we could 
 function as a team this was a difficult matter at first because no one could communicate with the italians as 
 they did not speak or understand english this problem was quickly overcome when we the canadians discovered that the italians 
 understood french later matters were further complicated when capt yarmoshuk fractured his arm in a para gliding accident reducing the 
 canadian contingent to two this was especially disappointing 0:disappoint 0:ing for him as he had been the essential player in 
 organizing our participation an important part of any high altitude climbing expedition is the trek to base camp careful planning 
 was required to ensure everyone including the 165 porters received adequate time to properly acclimatize to the high altitude our 
 base camp was to be located at the foot of the gasherbrum glacier at an altitude of over 17 000 
 ft the trek in covered approximately 170kms and lasted ten days the location of each night s camp was determined 
 by the daily altitude gain as a general rule we were not to gain more than 1 000 ft per 
 day the trek was filled with a multitude of scenic wonders and experiences the most notable highlight however was on 
 the eighth day when we viewed k2 for the first time it s sheer magnitude dwarfed all other surrounding mountains 
 and intimidated even our most experienced climber n sb mwo equivalent yousaf upon reaching base camp on 22 june we 
 bid farewell to all the porters and began the detailed task of organizing the 3 oookgs of stores and equipment 
 they had carried in 60 percent of the stores would remain in base camp whilst the 
 the patrician 1995 135 canadian flag at base camp remaining l oookgs were to be used during the climb these 
 stores were divided into small loads which we would late ferry up the mountain to higher camps like most climbing 
 expeditions today we planned on seiging the mountain rather than climbing it alpine style this meant that prior to making 
 any summit attempt we would establish and stock numerous camps at different elevations on the mountain this type of tactic 
 has statistically proven to be the most successful high camps that are well stocked provide climbers with an opportunity to 
 rest and acclimatize properly to high altitudes this greatly reduces the risk of climbers being stranded without adequate supplies during 
 poor weather sieging a mountain however does have a major disadvantage namely it is very labour intensive instead of just 
 making one trip alpine style several trips up and down the mountain with large loads are required to prepare each 
 camp our siege plan included an advance base camp being established above the icefalls on the gasherbrum glacier and four 
 high camps at successive intervals up the mountain initially the expedition which of 12 climbers and two high altitude porters 
 was divided into three teams each team would be responsible for completing its fair share of the tasks such as 
 establishing and stocking camps installing fixed lines and route finding once all the camps were in place the decision of 
 which team would make the first summit attempt would be made by lcol pirzada for many of us the 25th 
 of june was our first experience with climbing at high altitude after the first two hours of sucking wind i 
 no longer doubted 
 136 the patrician 1995 moving through the icefields from base camp to the adv camp camp one at over 19 
 000 ft summit still looms 7 000 ft above 
 137 the patrician 1995 everything i had read about the physical problems that occur when operating at high altitude i 
 now had firsthand knowledge of the never ending shortness of breath headaches and irritability if i was lucky and remained 
 healthy for the next month i would have to deal with insomnia loss of appetite rapid dehydration and poor concentration 
 finally there was always the possibility of severe frostbite this threat is enhanced by the lack of oxygen forcing the 
 body to reduce it s blood supply to the extremities in order to supply enough oxygen to its vital organs 
 if lady luck was against me i would be part of the 30 percent expected to succumb to acute mountain 
 sickness and life threatening pulmonary 0:pulmo 0:nary of cerebral edema a massive avalanche on 1 july destroyed our advance base 
 camp and injured two pakistani climbers another two pakistani climbers were suffering from the effects of acute mountain sickness and 
 could not climb this meant the reorganization of two new teams as the expedition s strength had been reduced to 
 eight climbers by 4 july team 1 which now included capt matt barlee the three italians capt iqbal and myself 
 was headed back to base camp for a rest over the past several days we had established and fully stocked

 team 2 comprised of lcol pirzada n sb yousaf and two high altitude porters was its way to camp 2 
 from there their task was to stock camp 3 and push the route to camp 4 they would then return

 the patrician 1995 141 irgj synopsis 1995 the highlight of 1 rgjs programme for 1995 has been the number of 
 otxs that the battalion has mounted from cyprus and the deployment of the falkland island reinforced infantry company group the 
 bn ftx for this year was a four week deployment to quatrana in jordan the desert offered excellent dry and 
 live firing opportunities for the battalion and some joint training with the jordanian army enhanced anglo jordanian relations the falkland 
 island group under nick haddock deployed from july to november the company suffered the worst winter in the south atlantic 
 since 1904 however this didn t detract from a highly successful operational tour there have been three company otxs this 
 year in february a company deployed to italy for two weeks training with the alpini based near the italian austrian 
 border the company participated 0:partici 0:pated in a series of mountain marches and learnt survival techniques in september b sp 
 coy had an excellent two weeks field firing in morocco and in october d coy returned to jordan programme 1996 
 the focus for the battalion in 1996 is the impending op grapple deployment six month unaccompanied tour with unprofor in 
 september the spring will be taken up with the battalion move to kiwi barracks bulford and the rerolling into a 
 mechanised saxon battalion as part of 1 mech bde conversion training will involve nco and support weapon cadres culminating with 
 a battalion ftx in may additional excitements include the running of the 3 uk div saam kape tours to birmingham 
 and oxford and a bramall trophy op grapple training runs throughout the summer however careful programming will ensure enough time 
 for cricket strawberries and the odd long weekend 2rgj the year has been dominated by our final winter deployment with 
 the amf l and deployment to palace barracks belfast we finished our time with the amf l at the end 
 of ex strong resolve a large nato exercise in the trondheim region of norway it was a challenge for the 
 battalion who in a period of 8 days acted as a screen brigade reserve occupied blocking positions carried out 2 
 battalion counter attacks and finally conducted a passage of lines with a us marine expeditionary force there is no doubt 
 that we had only just lost our status as arctic novices before finishing in the role this was frustrating for 
 the chain of command who were rising to the challenge and beginning to develop drills and doctrine which we would 
 have been able to build on over 
 the patrician 1995 142 a number of years as far as the riflemen were concerned the prospect of another arctic 
 winter was viewed with some trepidation and most were keen to move on to a new task our training for 
 northern ireland began in april we covered the full training programme working on the assumption that we must prepare for 
 the worst scenario the colonel in chief visited during the training package at lydd deployment to palace barracks was completed 
 by mid august and the settling in period should be completed by early november as the belfast reserve battalion there 
 is a constant standby commitment coupled with a need for relatively high numbers committed to guards and duties behaviour in 
 the local community has to be of the highest standard and the riflemen are under considerable pressure to keep out 
 of trouble the battalion seems to adjusting well to the new environment 4 v rgj 4 rgj have had a 
 good training year reorganisation the ta underwent an extensive reorganisation in april 1995 4 rgj lost the milan and mortar 
 platoons the ta recruits now form part about one third of the rifle company establishment these changes were carried out 
 without fuss and the loss of very few support coy volunteers the recce and assault pioneer pis have replaced the 
 anti tank and mortar platoons at mile end ta centre mile end is confirmed as a permanent 4 rgj ta 
 centre which means that the regiment continues to have a presence in tower hamlets training rgj were the first ta

 the battle all observers commented favourably on the ability of the ta to adapt from the usual rear areas security 
 role to high intensity all arms manoeuvre warfare overall the training was extremely challenging the laser equipment provided vivid realism 
 and this made camp enjoyable for all those who took part s v rgj having won the battle for survival 
 late last year 1995 has been a year of great change for the battalion due to the need to re 
 train every man in our new role as a fire support battalion in brief the battalion regrouped on tue 15 
 aug 
 the patrician 1995 143 into a three company structure hq company and two support companies each support company consists of 
 a 14 strong hq an 81mm mortar platoon a milan anti tank guided missile platoon and a sustained fire machine

 the patrician 1995 154 kapyong excerpts from a speech by col j r stone dso mc to the officers of 
 3 ppcli on 18 dec 73 about the second battalion second battalion princess patricia s canadian light infantiy was recaiited 
 mainly from the streets as was the rest of the 25th brigade which was to represent canada in korea many 
 were the stories told of the recruiting snafus you can read about them in strange battleground written by herb wood 
 himself a patricia general slim maclin then the adjutant general described it succinctly to me after i returned from korea 
 he said that trying to rush recruiting was analogous to trying to rush the process of procreation he said if 
 you and your wife decide to have a baby you take the necessary sexual action and await the normal gestation 
 period if you try to hurry the process you get an abortion that is what the recruiting operation for korea 
 was many recruits were re treads from world war 2 i was one myself among them were many dead beats 
 escapists from domestic and other troubles cripples neurotics and other useless types all of whom broke down under the rigorous 
 training program and were got rid of prior to our going into action here i might also say that those 
 who joined to fight for a cause were most difficult to find bill boss our accompanying war correspondent questioned almost 
 every man in the battalion trying to find the idealist the man who joined solely to fight a holy war 
 against communism like diogenes searching with his lantern trying to find an honest man bill was unsuccessful the strength of 
 the battalion was in its adventurers those who joined the army because there was a war to fight and they 
 wanted to be there personally i believe that all volunteer armies in wartime are composed mostly of adventurers in talking 
 of the strengths of the second battalion i would be remiss if i did not mention the part played by 
 the officers warrant officers and noncommissioned 0:non 0:commissioned officers who were transferred to us from first battalion they gave the 
 battalion a professional backbone and of course conducted a large part of the training i am sure that much of 
 our success as a unit stemmed from the efforts of these excellent soldiers about fighting the battle of kapyong if 
 you have seen the map of the kapyong battleground you will have noted that the australians had the lower feature 
 on the right hill 504 our feature hill 677 was much larger and i must confess much more difficult to 
 attack here i will interpose if you ever have to take up a defensive position on a mountain 
 the patrician 1995 155 of that size with a battalion of infantry make sure first that you listen carefully to 
 orders and know your objectives and second that you search your memory for everything you have been taught about the 
 selection of vital ground from which to conduct a defence on april 23 i took forward a large reconnaissance party 
 of company commanders gunner rep mortar re mmg and battalion mortar platoon commanders we were able to look at the 
 feature from the enemy side which gave us a good idea of probable attack approaches therefore i was able to 
 select the vital ground which had to be defended to deny the approaches to the enemy in my opinion our 
 success in holding our position and inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy was due in the most part to these 
 factors a we had trained and fought together for some eight months we believed in one another and the morale 
 of the battalion was high no one panicked even when we knew that we were surrounded and that there was 
 some infiltration of the position by the enemy b we had ample time for a proper reconnaissance and all subordinate 
 commanders had a look at the ground in daylight c although i was never a highly skilled soldier i have 
 always had a good eye for ground therefore the ground that was vital to the defence of the area came 
 quickly to my view d the move of b company to the right after the australians were beaten back no 
 doubt saved our right flank and gave warning of the move of the enemy on the bn hq area e 
 the evacuation of the wounded by helicopter was a big booster to morale and took a great load off my 
 mind f the airdrop of supplies was a wonderful bit of organization in japan as we had two supply sources 
 u s and british our ammunition had to be procured from both sources we would have been in sorry straits 
 had we not been supplied by air about the presidential unit citation the united states presidential citation is awarded to 
 units which in the opinion of the senior commander in the field and in the name of the president of 
 the united states deserve public recognition of earned honour and distinction 2 ppcli was so honoured even though the award 
 was not popular in some higher canadian military circles i will only say this about the award i repeat that 
 kapyong was not a great battle however we were surrounded by the enemy we could have run panicked in some 
 way or surrendered we stayed fought and withdrew on orders in a soldierly fashion this in itself was unique in 
 korea where bug outs were the normal manner of withdrawing in the circumstances i say that the award was well 
 earned and the battalion deserved public recognition of its actions of april 24 25 1951 
 the patrician 1995 156 about training the success at kapyong was due mainly to high morale and to good company 
 platoon and section commanders in their isolated defence areas they kept their heads down the morale of their troops up 
 and their weapons firing whatever support i could give i gave but the battle was theirs too much officer training 
 is aimed at high levels of command and not enough at the company and platoon level with a modicum of 
 experience at the lower levels anyone can take over at the higher many poor commanders have stayed in command at 
 brigade and divisional level in consequence of having a good staff at the platoon or company level the poor commander 
 is discovered the first day so i say that a division can survive the poor command for awhile but i 
 ll be damned if a platoon or a company can therefore play only superficially at moving divisions on 1 over 
 250 000 maps with fingers spread making right and left hooks concentrate on section platoon and company tactics learn from 
 experience just what human beings can endure and still fight learn to do your jobs properly at your own levels 
 of command it is surprising how easy it is to command a battalion when you have had success in commanding 
 a company and remember always that the man is the first weapon of battle train him toughen him treat him 
 fairly and demonstrate to him your fitness to be his commander when the day comes that you need him as 
 it did at kapyong he ll be with you all the way
