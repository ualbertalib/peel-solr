 1 the colonel of the regiment major general g g brown ostj cd once again it is my great pleasure 
 to send my very best wishes to all members of our regimental family wherever they and their families are located 
 whether they are serving in canada or serving canada abroad as so many individuals are and as our third battalion 
 did recently keeping the peace in cyprus in our fourth battalion with loyal edmonton regiment 0:regi 0:ment or now retired 
 and serving our regiment in other capacities 1980 has been another exciting year for us not only in our training 
 and other regimental activities but chiefly due to the return of our colonel in chief to regimental duty her visit 
 to our united kingdom branch on the occasion of their celebration of the battle of frezenberg held in london england 
 on the bth of may and her visit to her third battalion serving in cyprus and joining with them in 
 celebrating our national 0:na 0:tional day was a milestone in the life of the regiment her tremendous courage and determination 
 to return to regimental duty following the tragic events of one year ago have been an inspiration and an example 
 to us all and i have assured her on behalf of all of you of our affection our loyalty and 
 of our great joy at having her back among us i wish to extend my sincere congratulations to all patricias 
 for your outstanding efforts during this past year the outstanding united nations tour recently carried out by our third battalion 
 in cyprus and the first rate performance of all of you during our colonel in chief s visit to cyprus 
 the highly successful training programme of the first battalion in cluding a company participating with the british live firing exercises 
 in suffield and the inspiring performance of the second 0:se 0:cond battalion as they trooped the colour on victoria day 
 in the presence of the lieutenant governor colonel jim stone and the citizens of winnipeg patricias in the airborne regiment 
 0:regi 0:ment have also shared a challenging year and of course the many patricias working splendidly but behind the scenes 
 on staff at our schools and with the militia in all those difficult tasks that are so important and which 
 so many of our regiment 0:regi 0:ment are called upon to respond to i cannot reflect on the year s 
 activities without mentioning 0:mention 0:ing the strong and vital support given year in and year out by our wives and 
 families and in particular those families who have been separated from husbands and fathers whilst they served in cyprus and 
 other tasks at home and abroad for long periods of absence the association continues to grow and encouraging ideas and 
 support continually flow from this tremendous residue of expertise and i urge those of you who have recently retired to 
 link up with your local branch and join with them in the vital role they carry out in support of 
 our regiment which contributes so much not only to our growth but to the very character of the regiment i 
 look forward with great pleasure to visiting and speaking with as many of you as possible in the coming year 
 till then to all of you my best wishes for a good year 
 2 historical note the originals major l e grimshaw cd the original battalion paraded at lansdowne park ottawa 23 aug 
 1914 to receive the colour from hrh princess patricia 
 3 the battle of frezenberg bth may 1915 the story of the formation of the regiment has been thoroughly recorded 
 in history it is well known that within ten days of the signing of the charter on 10 august 1914 
 mobilization 0:mobiliza 0:tion was complete and nearly 1 100 all ranks were on parade at ottawa the story of their 
 gallant and glorious stand at frezenberg on 8 may 1915 is equally well known but who were those remarkable men 
 who formed and so firmly established the regiment in such a dramatic way in such short period of time when 
 recruiting began on 11 august 1914 the call went out for men with previous service so that an experienced battalion 
 0:bat 0:talion could be assembled quickly which would require minimal training and so could be sent into action as soon 
 as possible the response was incredible as the history records prospectors trappers guides cow punchers prize fighters farmers professional and 
 business men above all old soldiers poured into ottawa by every train they included a large number of the legion 
 of frontiersmen from the west and the entire edmonton pipe band under pipe major j colville by virtue of the 
 nature of the canadian population at the time the majority were english scottish and irish immigrants however the roll records 
 no less than eighteen countries of birth and their addresses on enlistment spanned all nine provinces 0:pro 0:vinces ten of 
 the american states all of the united kingdom india australia the channel islands and their number included 0:includ 0:ed a 
 dane a frenchman an italian and a russian their status of immigrants indicates something of their collective character having come 
 out to a new country and having work ed to establish themselves on its expanding frontiers these men had already 
 demonstrated an unusual degree of initiative determination and aptitude for adventure moreover as was required 0:re 0:quired the majority had 
 had previous service the history also records that of the original 1 098 all ranks 1 049 had previous service 
 of whom 456 had campaign service and wore a total of 771 decoration and medals they represented almost every british 
 army regiment and corps the royal marines royal navy many canadian militia units and the rnwmp most of the veterans 
 had served in the south african war although the variety of medals represented service in almost every part of the 
 empire and those were the days before ebgc medals this meant that the originals were not only experienced and seasoned 
 soldiers but that they were mature grown men many with families for example if a man had been eighteen and 
 had served in south africa in 1902 the last year of the war there he would have been thirty years 
 old in 1914 when he joined 0:join 0:ed ppcli imagine whole companies of men all ranks of whom had the 
 experience and maturity of the average warrant officers 0:of 0:ficers and csms of today little wonder they were a rather 
 remarkable lot it is probably fair to say that never before or since has such a collection of remarkable men 
 been gathered in a single regiment at the same time although each one was outstanding in his own way it 
 is impossible to recount so many individual stories but a few examples may serve to illustrate 0:il 0:lustrate their individual 
 and collective character every bastard s got one a derisive term coined by canadian soldiers in world war ii to 
 describe the canadian volunteer service medal and other medals for general service 
 4 paramount among them was of course the founder a hamilton gault had served in south africa as a subaltern 
 with 2nd canadian mounted rifles and subsequently in the sth royal highlanders black watch he was larger than life he 
 was a well educated gentleman of means and of high principle 0:princi 0:ple and he knew that freedom carried penalties 
 and responsibilities 0:respon 0:sibilities he conceived the idea of the regiment proposed promoted and financed it but with typical modesty 
 eschewed the honour of command deferring to lieutenant colonel francis 0:fran 0:cis farquhar dso then the governor general s military 
 secretary and a more experienced officer who had distinguished himself in south africa the founder quickly stamped his mark on 
 the battalion and his code became the code and standard of behaviour of the unit it was a simple catalogue 
 of things that were done and things that were not done nowadays many would find it sadly out of date 
 for it was based on unflinching loyalties to the crown to the regiment to comrades to belief in heritages and 
 traditions courage honesty modesty and good manners were taken for granted the founder lived by his principles and continually demonstrated 
 them by his own example through many heroic deeds several wounds his refusal to be evacuated or have his wounds 
 dressed until all others had been looked after his acceptance 0:ac 0:ceptance of the loss of a leg as simply 
 par for the course and continued good cheer throughout after he had his leg blown off at sanctuary wood in 
 1916 he was soon back with two wooden legs hubert and herbert he dilated on their advantages over the one 
 he had lost even with the best of wooden legs trench tours were out of the question so some sort 
 of employment was found near at hand at divisional hq he used to say he was running a cooking school 
 and perhaps he was but his many messages to the battalion rang like the notes of a hunting horn and 
 every now and then he would come stumping up to the front line to assure all hands that they were 
 indestructible on a night in august 1917 a sudden shot crashed on the patricia trenches a box barrage sealed off 
 their sector and in the rubble piles and smashed traverses the survivors crouched to meet the rush across no man 
 s land amid the clamour shouts came from far down the communication trench gault was on his way up scrambling 
 and stumbling cursing his handicap and bidding all to be of good cheer on the day of great acquittance 0:acquit 
 0:tance when we broke through in picardy and after four years were in the open for the first time he 
 came riding up across the fields on a charger which he was reputed to have stolen to give us the 
 view halloo for we were in sight of the kill later he became a member of parliament for taunton somerset 
 bought and learned to fly an airplane volunteered and served again in the second world war and throughout maintained his 
 abiding concern and loyalty to his regiment and leaving his stamp upon it which remains to this day of course 
 there were others among the officers there was talbot papineau a great grandson of the old rebel a rhodes scholar 
 a great constitutionalist and nationalist all gascon gestures and eloquence he insisted on wearing a french helment and a cock 
 s plume in it he was a major with an mc when he was later killed in action and some 
 thought that had he lived he might have become prime minister of canada there was charles stewart old charlie s 
 who rose from lieutenant to command the regiment winning two dsos a french croix de guerre and was twice mentioned 
 in despatches before he was killed in action commanding the regiment during the battle of cambrai near the end of 
 the war stewart was a nova scotian who in addition to having fought in south africa had roamed from china 
 to peru as a soldier of fortune he was a past master of the high bawdry of war and his 
 ribaldries would have filled columns there were other soldiers of fortune as well no 865 tracy richardson was an adventurous 
 american who by age 22 had earned a reputation as a machine gun expert fighting with various revolutionary groups from 
 nicaragua in 1909 through venezuela in 1911 the honduran banilla revolt and later in mexico between 1912 and 1914 he 
 was wounded manning his lewis gun shortly before frezenberg his adventures continued however as he was later commissioned in the 
 97th battalion cef a unit of americans flew with the royal naval air service transferred to the us air service 
 and eventually retired after the second world war as a lieutenant colonel in the usaaf there were bemedalled veterans of 
 more conventional armies 0:ar 0:mies and campaigns there were many like no 254 walter stanborough who at age 35 enrolled 
 as a private having had twelve years service in the grenadier guards and who wore four ribbons two for the 
 1897 campaign in egypt and the sudan one for south africa and the royal victorian medal for services 0:ser 0:vices 
 at queen victoria s funeral before he was killed in action 0:ac 0:tion at passchendaele in november 1917 stanborough had 
 become a sergeant been wounded twice mentioned in despatches and awarded a dcm also numbered among the old sweats were 
 men like no 160 pte george crockey and no 691 pte william kerr who had both campaigned on the north 
 west frontier of india in 1908 and no 1739 pte sam linley who had two earlier indian campaigns at tirah 
 in 1897 8 and on the punjab frontier as well as south africa behind him among other south african veterans 
 were no 126 harry nelson who proudly wore the queen s medal with six clasps and who as a sergeant 
 later won a dcm and no 1186 john anderson with both the queen s and king s south africa medals 
 and who later won a mc but lost a leg as rsm at sanctuary wood most others had some other 
 kind of service although without campaign 0:cam 0:paign experience such as no 1320 frank shillam who had been a rambunctious 
 young constable in the rnwmp in alberta 0:alber 0:ta and saskatchewan prior service was only the beginning and many originals 
 continued to record considerable adventure no 640 louis scott had previous service with the royal engineers joined as a private 
 but was a sergeant at frezenberg where he was awarded a dcm for conspicuous gallantry and resource on the bth 
 may 1915 at hooge all the officers having been killed or wounded he collected a party of men and succeeded 
 in holding a trench in spite of a very heavy attack by the enemy three weeks later he was the 
 rsm he was subsequently commissioned 0:com 0:missioned twice wounded served on attachment to the raf between the wars commanded the 
 edmonton regiment and became a colonel in the second world war no 1576 jim christie had been a hunter and 
 trapper in the canadian north west and came to the regiment bearing a set of interesting scars from an encounter 
 with a bear in which he had come away the better he distinguished himself as a sniper and although wounded 
 in april 1915 he won a dcm at frezenberg as a corporal was later mentioned in despatches as a sergeant 
 was commissioned and won a mc at passchendaele as regimental sniping officer a number of originals continued adventures in other 
 spheres beyond the regiment lcol pelly having commanded the regiment on two occasions and rebuilt it after frezenberg went on 
 to command a british brigade with great distinction see the patrician 1979 others like no 9 clarence da wigney who 
 joined as a private and became a sergeant was commissioned in the 7th battalion the london regiment of the british 
 army where he later won a mc as a lieutenant commanding 0:com 0:manding a company some of the more interesting 
 exploits were those of the originals who had the misfortune to become prisoners of war lt w g colquhoun the 
 scout and sniping officer who at 6 feet 4 inches in height naturally was known as shorty was one of 
 the first canadians to be captured in the great war he was cut off and captured in a daring trench 
 raid at st eloi in february 1915 and was awarded a mc for the action for a time he managed 
 to convince his captors that all canadians 
 5 were his size and he was subsequently brought to the notice of the secretary of state for gallant determination 
 in attempting 0:attemp 0:ting to escape from captivity after the war shorty colquhoun 0:col 0:quhoun became the adjutant of the 
 battalion later commanded 0:command 0:ed and became a brigadier during the second world war another escaper was no 39 corporal 
 edward edwards also a veteran of india and south africa edwards was captured at frezenberg when one of the forward 
 trenches was overrun he escaped from german camps three times was recaptured twice but the third time made it out 
 through holland in a three week escape and evasion adventure which covered 150 miles he was back home in toronto 
 by the end of 1916 it is always difficult to measure the collective quality of a particular group of people 
 and individual honours and awards are often a matter of some debate however it is interesting to note that although 
 the originals comprised only about onefifth 0:one 0:fifth of all the patricias who served during world war i they accounted 
 for 9 of the 11 dsos including two second awards 25 of the 39 dcms and 50 of the 69 
 mentions in despatches of the regiment a total of 81 of them or approximately 1 out of 12 were commissioned 
 from the ranks 36 in the regiment and the remainder in other canadian or british units by any conventional 0:con 
 0:ventional measure they were an outstanding collection of soldiers the original battalion ceased to exist as such with the battle 
 of frezenberg 8 may 1915 although many individuals continued on in the regiment or filtered back after recovering from wounds 
 however in a few short months they had established a remarkable record with their spirit courage loyalty individual and collective 
 ability they left a legacy of high standards and superb soldiering to the new young patricias of the university companies 
 who with a sprinkling of originals among them carried on in the same tradition other reinforcements which followed were also 
 equal to the tasks as were other patricias years later who carried the same tradition through the plains of sicily 
 the mountains of italy and the poulders of holland and later the cold korean hills this great legacy and tradition 
 of unequalled combat soldiering is worth remembering at all times particularly now the future is uncertain 0:uncer 0:tain but whatever 
 it brings with the example and tradition of the originals firmly established patricias will carry on footnote there are few 
 world war i patricias remaining and fewer originals to the best of our knowledge those still in our ranks are

 was exercised as the friendly force in january 1980 during exercise rapier thrust 80 in wainwright the winter weather did 
 not hamper the fighting prowess of the battalion 0:bat 0:talion but served to further sharpen our skills following this an 
 extensive course training schedule was conducted interspersed 0:in 0:terspersed with regimental birthday activities and the brigade sports competition exercise strong

 a stranger in your own land but if a piece of great britain were transplanted i feel sure it would 
 spring roots at cfb suffield when you stroll down the tumbleweed strewn roads with the scent of deep fried eggs 
 deep fried bread deep fried lunch deep fr wafting through your nostrils you feel like you should be in piccadilly 
 instead of camp crowfoot but there we were calgary s finest amid the dust and the kippers in yet another 
 medicine man serial i don t believe that any medicine man exercise could be called ordinary the spirit of the 
 land defies it on the other hand though you can only look at so much treeless barren landscape 0:land 0:scape 
 before it all looks the same and in two and a half weeks of running up and down the length 
 of the suff ield training area you have the opportunity to see a lot of barren landscape after an intensive

 a joint british canadian venture that sees about three canadian mechanized companies 0:com 0:panies joining several of the seven serials 
 held each year the ultimate goal of the exercise is to train commanders at the battle group level in all 
 phases of war since most of the units meet for the first time on arrival in suffield a brief warmup 
 0:warm 0:up period occupies the first week while everyone has an opportunity 0:op 0:portunity to work the bugs out at 
 progressively higher levels c company started off with a few days of zeroing navigation a nightmare for the inexperienced and 
 section skirmishing we rapidly moved on to platoon and company tactics and by the end of the shake out period 
 we were ready we had met some of the local natives of the non legged variety the cqms was up 
 to speed on cold beer the tpt sgt was as usual hiding behind the eight ball and the oc was 
 showing the first signs of panic the 2ic was lurking back with the echelon waiting for an opportunity to seize 
 command but the snakes kept him and morrison at bay the csm ranted and raved as they are wont to 
 do and a new position called ammo nco was created to keep crabby old sergeants off the backs of new 
 platoon commanders and speaking of new platoon commanders well need i say more at any rate by the time we 
 were linked up with the british we were a pretty tough crowd as the water tower will attest to that

 7 exercise kernal potlatch ii exercise kernal potlatch ii was a large scale canadian us amphibious exercise which involved elements 
 of 1 cbg a us marine brigade many us and canadian warships and sea and land based aircraft this force 
 was to land on the northern tip of vancouver island to destroy an enemy lodgement represented by 1 ppcli and 
 a us marine company the battalion b company group deployed to vancouver island in late september to prepare defensive positions 
 the weather was abominable and the terrain made preparations difficult the landing force was unable to conduct an am phibious 
 assault across the beaches because of heavy seas so they inserted the force by helicopters this change of plan resulted 
 in a quick redeployment of b company by helicopter and on foot to depth positions the exercise ended with a 
 final attack by 3 ppcli and 2 9 us marine battalion on the final objective on knob hill the highest 
 hill in the area b company considers that they would have successfully repulsed the attack however it s all over

 must be given to the battalion hockey team who put on numerous heroic displays throughout the season although only four 
 teams competed in the league there were many hard fought battles between them the defeat of the headquarters and signal

 when we left calgary and we were to be blessed with this for the duration of our five day stay 
 in the area although huge the mosquitos were never so numerous as to present a problem to the seasoned patricias 
 our greatest challenge came from the muskeg and very thick forest growth the ground was interlaced with logs fallen trees 
 and small creeks winding their way through our areas of responsibility the creeks proved to be a tremendous morale booster 
 for those who enjoy that kind of terrain and there were a few of us and guaranteed soaked feet for

 22 the second battalion captain d g cassidy cd the training year 1979 80 was a normally active one for 
 second battalion once again all ranks of the unit undertook their tasks with enthusiasm and panache determined to maintain the 
 very high standards achieved in the preceding years all ranks were shocked and saddened by news of the violent and 
 criminal attack upon our regimental first family lord mountbatten s death and the injuries to our colonel in chief inspired 
 these emotions world wide however they were most especially felt within the patricia regimental family it was with a great 
 deal of relief that we heard that the colonel in chief s condition was steadily improving fall training programme as 
 august 1979 drew to a close and soldiers returned from the wilds of nopiming park the battalion engaged in the 
 usual shuffle of rifle companies support weapon platoons and administrative sections new officers and ncos were welcomed 0:welcom 0:ed into 
 the fold and each company and platoon began an individual 0:in 0:dividual training programme designed not only to practise the 
 basic skills of the infantryman but also to acquaint us with each other two newly posted rifle company commanders and 
 six brand new platoon commanders introduced themselves to second battalion soldiers the period of september and october 0:oc 0:tober was 
 fully taken up with this valuable training all companies 0:com 0:panies had participated in a most successful spring battalion marksmanship 
 programme and their skills were reinforced by further practice in the fall each company trekked to shilo at least once 
 for training programmes practising individual and platoon defensive skills by the end of october companies were operating well in the 
 basic infantry role and were ready to begin the conversion to mechanized operations during this time the unit was equipped 
 with 91 apcs redistributed from formations and units across the country bravo company deployed in early september to bardufoss 0:bar 
 0:dufoss in northern norway to participate in exercise bar frost with the norwegian army brigade north it was a challenging 
 and physically demanding introduction to some of the roughest country in europe apparently the one major problem 0:pro 0:blem encountered 
 by bravo was the rations or lack thereof clandestine reports received about huge consumption of big macs upon their return 
 are thought to be exaggerated but this is not yet confirmed during this period the unit sports programme was in 
 full swing highlighted by the annual wars of october on the football field there are always difficulties in a busy 
 unit in maintaining stability in company teams but the competition was good the games well played and the weather cooperated

 31 the third battalion exercise kern a l potlatch beach landing island duty the third battalion s activities this past 
 year have centered on two separate and distinct islands vancouver island and cyprus separated by thousands of miles and 10 
 time zones these two islands have provided the battalion with a variety of exciting and interesting challenges the first insular 
 encounter was at the northern tip of vancouver 0:van 0:couver island during exercise kernal potlatch 11 for this operation the 
 third battalion joined forces with maritime command 0:com 0:mand pacific the united states marines and the us navy to conduct 
 a large scale transit and amphibious landing on the rugged shores of northern vancouver island after a successful 0:suc 0:cessful 
 land operation and return to garrison the battalion s attention turned to another island cyprus months later with unit training 
 briefings and a preparatory exercise under its belt the advance party of 140 arrived in cyprus on 31st march 1980 
 within ten days the battalion was in position on the line in the nicosia area as this article goes to 
 print the tour of united nations duty is almost complete and the battalion is in the process of returning to 
 work point barracks between these two major events the battalion conducted trade specialty courses and two weeks of winter warfare 
 training 0:train 0:ing in the chilcotin area 1979 1980 has certainly provided all ranks of the third battalion 0:bat 0:talion 
 with a variety of experiences and memories the most memorable being the visit of our colonel in chief to the 
 battalion 0:bat 0:talion in cyprus armed with these experiences the third battalion 0:bat 0:talion is now returning to victoria ready 
 to accept the challenge of reorganization and training as a grizzly armoured 0:ar 0:moured personnel carrier equipped battalion exercise kernal 
 potlatch ii for most troops the joint canadian united states naval and amphibious operation exercise potlatch began in earnest on 
 the 17th of september 1979 when they departed the naval dockyard in esquimalt bo in reality the exercise began months 
 0:mon 0:ths earlier with the conduct of several joint planning sessions the months of july and august were busy months 
 for many members of the battalion as embarkation landing and logistics plans were drawn up and stores and equipment readied 
 for the exercise the first phase of the operation involved moving the battalion 0:bat 0:talion to san diego califorhia to 
 link up with the us marines and the navy the troops were transported on board hmcs peace keeping in cyprus 
 provider hmcs restigouche htvlcs terra nova and hmcs gatineau although these ships were not designed as troop transports the navy 
 did everything in their power to make the four day transit as comfortable as possible the soldiers soon found themselves 
 familiar with the many strange nautical terms and were shown how a ship works on arrival in san diego the 
 battalion was met by the unit s advance party and shuttled across town to the huge us naval dockyards where 
 the uss mobile uss cleveland and uss alamo awaited them the troop holds of these ships crowded and to say 
 the least compact were to be the battalion s 0:bat 0:talion 0:s home for the next two weeks the time 
 in san diego was taken up with familiarization training on the us navy s assault boats every soldier became quickly 
 aware of the various ship drills for various contingencies such as man overboard 0:over 0:board and life boat stations after 
 intensive training the battalion 0:bat 0:talion was given some time to see the sights of southern california with the beaches 
 being a prime attraction on the morning of the 24th the large naval flotilla steamed out of san diego harbour 
 it was an impressive sight indeed to see so many ships in line head out to the open sea the 
 first stop enroute was at camp pendleton north of san diego where the battalion joined by a marine battalion in 
 an assault rehearsal this rehearsal worked like clock work with the assault waves hitting the sandy shores of red and 
 blue beach right on time the rehearsal over the long transit to the amphibious 0:am 0:phibious area of operations began 
 with the troops doing refresher training and gaining their sea legs by jogging around the swaying decks reconnaissance platoon on 
 board the uss alamo had steamed on ahead ready to go ashore 48 hours prior to the assault contact the 
 enemy force theirs was a difficult 0:dif 0:ficult job as they moved to shore in high seas in rubber assault 
 boats the main body meanwhile had their fill of movies and that drink affectionately known as bug juice cool aid 
 finally after rounding the tip of vancouver island the ships of the amphibious task force were in position with the 
 battalion group and the 11th marine amphibious unit ready to launch the morning of 21st september was clear and bright 
 but the seas were high alpha company and battalion tactical headquarters 0:head 0:quarters were launched on signal and headed for 
 the beach they it as high seas prevented landing unfortunately 0:unfor 0:tunately the rest of the day was spent trying 
 to get the assault craft back onto the dock of the mother ship the uss cleveland undaunted it was time 
 to try it again the next day 
 32 the next morning headquarters and a company did get ashore but the sea became rough again and the amphibious 
 assault was terminated the remainder of the assault was made by helicopter and for all troops except the echelon which 
 stayed afloat the land operation began our battalion with the marine battalion on its right soon made contact with the 
 enemy and by relentless pursuit and deep by passing operations forced them to stand and fight the terrain was rugged 
 hilly and wet but the pursuit went on and within 48 hours the operation was successfully concluded 0:conclud 0:ed immediately 
 the units were ferried back to their mother ships for the trip back to victoria with just enough time to 
 dry out combat boots and get dry clean clothing ogden point in downtown victoria came into view with the battalion 
 on board the three ships anchored on the 6th of october the journey

 courses and combat leader s course the courses were primarily run in the victoria area with fort lewis washington being

 the allimportant 0:all 0:important shooting competition visits it is to the battalion s advantage that summer time in cyprus is 
 a good time to visit the island consequently we have the opportunity to host a number of visitors these visits 
 interrupt the soldiers routine which helps relieve the boredom of op duty the first visitor we welcomed was the commander 
 of mobile command lieutenant general jean jacques paradis and chief of staff administration brigadier general w dabros who came to 
 cyprus to view the battalion in an operational setting the highlight of the three day visit was the sector four 
 line tour lgen paradis and bgen dabros spent four hours touring the line and talking to the men on the 
 ops it was a rare treat for many of the young soldiers to have the opportunity 0:op 0:portunity of discussing 
 their personal views with their commanders 0:com 0:manders of the army the countess mountbatten of burma our colonel in chief 
 arrived on the island on the 28th of june to visit the members of her battalion the visit was timely 
 as many soldiers received their un medals from her the colonel in chief spent a week visiting soldiers during duty 
 on the ops and in the more relaxed setting of their messes lady patricia last visited the third battalion in 
 july 1978 to help celebrate canada day in victoria our third distinguished visitor to the island of aphrodite was brigadier 
 the honourable henry p bell irving lieutenant governor of the province of british columbia his visit was towards the end 
 of the tour and thus he was able to extract a true picture of a cyprus tour from the soldiers 
 he conversed with other distinguished visitors scheduled for the end of the tour include the chtef of the defence staff 
 and the minister of the national defence canada day canada day was celebrated with the presentation of un medals in 
 the morning followed by the elaborate festivities of klondike days during these celebrations the battalion was honoured with the presence 
 of our colonel in chief following the medals parade on 1 july lady patricia opened the klondike to all during 
 this day 500 guests from the other contingents were given a glimpse of canada s historical past the guests received 
 their passports to the klondike from the north west mounted police represented by the australian civil police this passport entitled 
 them to receive a miner s grant pan for gold enter the salmon fishing derby go for a donkey ride 
 watch the log rolling log bucking and tree topping competitions and when thirsty obtain a free drink at the water

 frontier days the battalion also had the opportunity to work with our allied regiment the royal green jackets who by 
 coincidence happened to be on peace keeping duty the third battalion of the royal green jackets was on our left

 cwo hank haas formerly rsm of the regimantal depot when it was located at griesbach in 1956 61 speaking of 
 griesbach barracks the unit is now quartered in none other following the move east of the airborne 0:air 0:borne regiment 
 several years ago it was decided to consolidate 0:con 0:solidate all units of northern alberta militia district from prince of 
 wales armoury and ortona armoury into one central location our administration offices are now located on the second 0:se 0:cond 
 floor of the west wing of the frezenberg building with the qm located in bldg h 22 across from the 
 outdoor 25 yard ranges while we left ortona armoury with considerable regret there was also a great pride in being 
 able to move into parts of the former regimental home station hamilton gault barracks the following is a short outline 
 of unit activities over the past year new regular support staff officer the 1979 80 training year could not have 
 started off better than with the arrival of capt mike diakow a patricia serving with 3 rcr in germany young 
 eager and up to date on all the latest nato equipment and tactics capt diakow had injected a shot of 
 vitality into the unit of particular note has been his strong assistance in small arms training which will be described 
 0:describ 0:ed in more detail further on officer nco professional advancement training all officers and ncos of namd spent several 
 weekends brushing up on their basic advance to contact defensive and offensive operations in preparation for milcon 80 the highlight 
 of this training was an excellent slide presentation on warsaw pact military equipment given by capt diakow city of edmonton 
 75th anniversary parade the 7th of october was a proud day for the unit the city s 75th anniversary was 
 celebrated with the largest military parade since world war 11 as history dictates the patricias were well represented a unit 
 guard a 100 man guard from the first battalion and the ppcli regimental band one of the many highlights of 
 this day was the sight of the two patricia guards doing a regimental fix bayonets together exercise burma road this 
 is a yearly show when the first battalion hosts the reserve infantry units in its area for a week end 
 of training displays and familiarization tours the exercise was held this year on the week end of 27 28 october 
 and was attended by officer 0:of 0:ficer and senior ncos from the loyal edmonton regiment 4 ppcli the calgary highlanders 
 the north saskatchewan regiment and the regina rifles lcol reay and his efficient training staff conducted an excellent 0:ex 0:cellent 
 two days of training which included communications instruction a cpx a tour of the pioneer platoon facilities a demonstration and 
 practical use of sniper equipment and last but not least a demonstration of the capabilities of the grizzly 0:grizz 0:ly 
 the last was of particular interest to unit members attending 0:atten 0:ding as we hope to be receiving four of 
 these vehicles in the near future the exercise wound up on sunday with some detailed lectures on the differences between 
 life in the canadian 0:cana 0:dian forces and warsaw pact forces reserve personnel receive command post operations instruction 0:instruc 0:tion 
 from signals sgt 
 61 winter and spring training the 1979 80 winter was spent on the type of training that the weather in 
 this part of the country dictates cold weather operations three basic objectives were set and worked on how to dress 
 to live in extreme cold weather how to properly use the cold weather equipment such as arctic tents and cooking 
 0:cook 0:ing utensils and mastering the use of small arms in extreme cold weather the several exercises to redwater and 
 wainwright 0:wain 0:wright were very successful and everyone must have learned their lessons as there were no cases of frostbite 
 or exposed skin sticking to metal small arms training the main objective of the unit over the past year has 
 been to improve our standing in the individual use of small arms the number one standard for measuring this goal 
 has been the reserve infantry small arms competition this competition is fired by all reserve units in canada and features 
 individual sections 0:sec 0:tions on pistols smg and rifle it is no secret that we have done poorly over the 
 last number of years and it was the co s intention that we would place high in the 1980 competition 
 with capt ivi j diakow lending all his experience and pushing his hardest the unit was turned upside down to 
 turn out every possible marksman and first class shot three weekends 0:week 0:ends at wainwright plus extensive use of the 
 outdoor 25 yard range at griesbach worked wonders by time the final count was done the unit teams had surpassed 
 the winning scores in all three sections of the 1980 competition this was it even if we didn t win 
 each section we knew we would place high and have a good chance at the over all title then the 
 roof fell in even while capt diakow was making the final computations a message arrived from st hubert the competition 
 for 1980 had been cancelled rules for a new competition to start in 1981 would be issued the disappointment of 
 this message hit the unit a hard blow for many of our young militiamen this competition represented their first chance 
 at a major accomplishment our only solace pending reply of a rather explicit protest sent to st hubert by the 
 district commander is that we have the knowledge that we raised our own standard from near the bottom 0:bot 0:tom 
 to a point where very few if any reserve units could outshoot 0:out 0:shoot us cpl robitaille takes aim during 
 rifle competition all ranks and trades took part in the competition shoots cpl rarog takes part in smg kneeling and 
 sitting sections of shoot 
 62 pte haight during standing section of smg shoot milcon 80 the whole concept of milcon 80 was different from 
 other years for the first time in a decade the individual corps went back to their own type of training 
 carried out independently from other units this was further changed when it was decided 0:decid 0:ed that each district would 
 be made responsible for the organization and running of training for one specific corps our district was tasked to do 
 the infantry group training as the only infantry unit in the district it quickly fell on lcol miller to be 
 the infantry group commander along with the necessary planning and preparation in the last week of july elements from the 
 loyal edmonton 0:edmon 0:ton regiment 4 ppcli calgary highlanders north saskatchewan 0:saskat 0:chewan regiment regina rifles cameron highlanders of canada 
 royal winnipeg rifles and lake superior scottish arrived 0:ar 0:rived in dundurn for a week s concentration while the ler 
 personnel remained as the group headquarters the other units were distributed to make two full companies training concentrated on defensive 
 operations small numbers from the headquarters defence platoon were used as a probing enemy while the companies worked through the 
 week in completing defensive positions to make sure none got bored there was a very strong emphasis on night patrolling 
 0:patroll 0:ing with a total of one live fire ambush patrol one fighting patrol and three recce patrols going out 
 each night the livefire 0:live 0:fire ambush patrol became a drawing point for spectators from other corps areas and the 
 main camp staff imagine the surprise 0:sur 0:prise of the patrol commander as he came over the hill to recce 
 the area only to find up to 100 spectators sitting on the hillside maj marshall watches as recce patrol commanders

 in a row cpl d d oakie has won the queen s medal as overall winner at the dcra annual 
 national championships at connaught ranges ottawa the win proved 0:prov 0:ed once and for all that the previous win was 
 not just a bit of luck in addition to his dcra win cpl oakie also fired as a member of 
 this year s canadian bisley team where he finished well placed among the top 100 shooters in the commonwealth one 
 sad point to this story as happens to so many of our better reserve members cpl oakie has since left 
 the unit to enroll in the regular forces he is now serving with the royal canadian regiment ler and 418 
 squadron bands a successful combo in the summer of 1977 it was apparent that the ler band was too small 
 to continue on one of the major complications was that they had lost their conductor respectively the 418 s band 
 was also small but they did have a conductor in weighing matters it became obvious to both cos that the 
 ideal solution was to combine the two the band now carries the workload of what used to be done by 
 two besides practicing every monday and wednesday 0:wednes 0:day evening the band also plays about once every week at some 
 type of function in the month of may alone they took part in eight functions ranging from cadet inspections to 
 recruiting displays one of their major projects and also their most popular is playing at various nursing homes in the 
 edmonton 0:ed 0:monton area lt c jacobson is the band conductor the c is for claire she is the first

 afternoon with this in mind twenty or so members of the northern alberta militia district once again constructed and entered 
 a raft in the world championship great canadian sourdough raft race held on the north saskatchewan river once again the 
 local naval reserve failed to provide the promised 0:promis 0:ed outboard motors so once again the crew had to paddle 
 the raft the entire length of the race maj marshall sgt grier and sgt scheuerman were the unit members who 
 took part in this two day adventure no prizes were won by the district raft but a good time was 
 had by all we were the envy of all the other 300 or so rafts what with our modular tent

 64 the royal green jackets the past year has seen all three regular battalions of the regiment once again subject 
 to extensive commitments terms such as turbulence and overstretch can in no way adequately describe a very hectic though in 
 many respects satisfying time the ist battalion in its final year in hong kong found itself totally committed to the 
 vast and tragic refugee crisis originating from china and vietnam the extensive coverage given to the problem by the world 
 s press requires no further elaboration it is however interesting to note that many of those refugees from vietnam who 
 arrived in the colony by such craft as the skylock and huey feng now reside in canada any hopes harboured 
 within the battalion for a respite from the build up of refugee pressure in 1978 were soon dispelled in 1979 
 a problem that on our arrival in the colony was of the magnitude of 2 or 3 illegal immigrants from 
 china a day had grown to be in excess on occasions of over a thousand 0:thou 0:sand refugees from a 
 large part south east asia a day by the end of the year respite from the heavy operational commitment 0:commit 
 0:ment to this situation never actually arrived until we handed over to our relieving unit the queen s own highlanders 
 in march of this year our attention were briefly divided during the annual typhoon season in what many justifiably regard 
 as the mistaken recognition that the male temperament is as unpredictable 0:un 0:predictable and voluble as that of the female 
 typhoons in 1979 were called both girls and boys names typhoons ellis hope and mac saw our standby companies heavily 
 committed 0:commit 0:ted on yet another venture in aid of civil power the 160 mph winds of hope the worst 
 typhoon in hong kong for 9 years and their effects proved like so many aspects of life in the colony 
 0:col 0:ony an unforgettable experience against this background the activities within the battalion had to go on the commitment to 
 training for limited war and internal security at individual and unit level continued as did our participation in extensive sporting 
 and community relation programmes we additionally played host to many distinguished political and military visitors to the colony during this 
 time as well as looking to the needs of a variety of visitors many groups and individuals also managed to 
 get away from the colony with varying degrees of justification and legitimacy one company group under our exchange officer from 
 the ppcli captain dan mac lean went to fiji to train for ten weeks others managed to get malaya indonesia 
 and new zealand to name but a few of the places visited the rsm mr eddie bright his urge for 
 travel undiminshed by a battalion expedition 0:ex 0:pedition to nepal found sufficient stimulus on his return to commence organizing a 
 further expedition to yet another quiet and remote place for 1980 this time greenland the battalion returned to england in 
 march of this year such was our popularity within the hounslaw district of london 0:lon 0:don during the fireman s 
 strike of 1977 that we can only assume we are back there by request whatever the pace of life looks 
 unlikely to slacken aside from the normal duties around which garrison life supposedly revolves are public duties internal security commitments 
 of various natures and preparation for a forthcoming northern ireland tour in 1981 the 2nd battalion s year started inauspiciously 
 with the threat that it would deploy to run sewage works in wales as the battalion was about to embark 
 on an intensive training programme for northern ireland the threat wasn t much welcomed and thankfully never materialized the battalion 
 arrived 0:ar 0:rived in north armagh in april and left in august having complete 0:com 0:plete a most successful tour 
 in the province there is little more satisfying than completing a tour having inflicted casualties on the enemy without sustaining 
 lasting damage to oneself garrison life in tidworth has proved busy and varied and the battalion was fortunate to go 
 to the usa on exercise in march of this year the exercise was the first of a series and proved 
 thoroughly interesting and worthwhile certainly the scale of helicopter support that can be expected when working with our american allies 
 was a revelation the year promises to continue to be active with the battalion eagerly awaiting posting to minden in 
 germany this november the 3rd battalion completed an 18 month accompanied tour at northern ireland on 1 st september and 
 left the province for oakington in cambridgeshire with few regrets the tour in londonberry proved quiet as the following skirmishes 
 for the period 16th march 1978 to 1 september 1979 bear witness shootings involving security forces 9 bombings 22 incidents 
 involving 140 devices of which half exploded half were neutralized weapon finds 9 including 6 rifles operational casualties 1 not 
 seriously wounded terrorists killed wounded nil furthermore if statistics are to be employed as a measure of success then the 
 battalion s success can be qualifed by the fact that along the 20 mile stretch of border so little happened 
 at a time when everywhere else the provisional ira was doing so much better whilst satisfying for many other parties 
 it was a disappointing time for the riflemen who after repeatedly being geared up to meet a particular threat had 
 the frustration of never actually seeing it materialize life in oakington has proved rather pleasant and the battalion 0:bat 0:talion 
 has been able to complete an ambitious programme of individual training retraining in those skills which of necessity had been 
 foregone in northern ireland and sport the latter is which the unashamed enthusiasm of the exchange officer from the ppcli 
 captain now major vince kennedy oc a company has impressed all the battalion is currently engaged 0:engag 0:ed in a 
 six month tour in cyprus which started in may of this year and as such is enjoying to the full 
 the way and fruits of mediterranean life

 1979 and may 1980 respectively regimental stable belts and berets may now be worn the rar has adopted a horizontally 
 striped red and rifle green belt and a rifle green beret the beret is similar to the ppcli beret and 
 in fact many officers are wearing berets obtained from canadian contacts the beret does not however replace the traditional slouch 
 hat which may be worn at the soldiers discretion and will be retained for ceremonial occasions as a background to 
 the battalion reports is should be noted that the battalions of the regiment form the basis of three task forces 
 tf 1 and 2 4 rar in 3tf at townsville 3 and 5 7 rar in itf at sydney and 
 6 and 8 9 rar in 6tf at brisbane the tfs are employed in three operational roles itf concentrating upon 
 mechanized operations 3tf on warfare in the tropical environment and 6tf on conventional warfare operations thus the duties performed within 
 the regiment are varied and the skills required for each mode of warfare retained 0:retain 0:ed sth 7th battalion 5 
 7 rar has continued to develop its expertise as the mechanized battalion of the regiment at this stage though we 
 are still restricted to one fully mechanized rifle company and mechanized elements of battalion headquarters and support 0:sup 0:port company 
 activities during the past year have therefore been a mix of mechanized and dismounted operations exercise shooting stick was dismounted 
 and the major exercise for 1979 it was conducted in two stages on both the holsworthy range and the singleton 
 range the holsworthy range is the local training area adjacent to our barracks which are 30 km west of sydney 
 the singleton range surrounds the infantry centre some 200 km north of sydney using both ranges provided an opportunity to 
 practise redeployment and a larger and varying scene for the exercise setting which was basically an advance to contact culminating 
 in battalion attacks 0:at 0:tacks ex shifting sands 11 the anti armour platoon on the move in the womera area 
 typical of most training areas used by 3 rar the mechanized company of 5 7 rar prepares to move out

 has ranged from jungle to conventional warfare and from section to mechanized battalion 0:bat 0:talion group level interspersed with training 
 exercises elements of the regiment have participated in major civilian activities overseas detachments and support tasks for other corps reports 
 from three battalions 5 7 6 and 8 9 rar are presented to illustrate the variety of training and other 
 activities 0:ac 0:tivities undertaken and to reduce the repetitiveness and length of six reports in august 1979 the mechanized company 
 had a chance to display their skills when they acted as enemy against the 2nd cavalry regiment royal australian armoured 
 corps the 2nd cavalry regiment is co located with us at holsworthy and provided 0:pro 0:vided a great deal of 
 assistance to the battalion during our mechanized trials the exercise was conducted at cobar which is 650 km west of 
 sydney in the outback of new south wales the area surrounding cobar is ideally suited to mechanized operations it is 
 flat open country verging on desert when there hasn t been regular rainfall for some time the people of cobar 
 are becoming rather accustomed to invasions 0:inva 0:sions of the military as it has become a popular area for mobile 
 mechanized exercises 
 67 the latter half of 1979 saw good fortune come to d company 0:com 0:pany with a three month detachment 
 to butterworth air base in malaysia this detachment is shared by all battalions of the regiment and provides security forces 
 for the royal australian air force mirage squadron deployed there the three months in malaysia provides excellent jungle warfare training 
 as well as an opportunity for all to enjoy another culture and cheap shopping at duty free ports a visit 
 to singapore is one of the highlights of the detachment the regiment has a long association with the people of 
 malaysia and singapore and we are always made welcome which helps dispel the blues of three months separation from those 
 at home 1980 began with the normal start of the year rush a three week course for the junior ncos 
 to enhance their skills and leadership qualities a drivers and crew commanders course for the company that became the mechanized 
 company 0:com 0:pany for 1980 and a promotion course for soldiers aspiring to be corporals ensured that the battalion was 
 fully aware that christmas was over the aim for the first half of 1980 was to build up for a 
 major 0:ma 0:jor mechanized exercise in may it wasn t all training of course support to the army reserve equivalent 
 to the territorials ammunition depot guards and living firing practices have helped vary the training programme parades too naturally formal 
 guards were mounted to welcome the us chief of staff general e c meyer and to open the royal agricultural

 his excellency sir roden cutler vc kcmg kcvo cbe the royal easter show is australia s biggest fair which runs

 71 the history of princess patricia s canadian light infantry by major w a morrison cd due to the exceptional 
 circumstances surrounding the founding of our regiment the story of the ppcli has been told time and again most if 
 not all of the military histories of the great war mention how our founder a hamilton gault rushed 0:rush 0:ed 
 to ottawa scarcely forty eight hours before war was officially 0:of 0:ficially declared with his offer to form a regiment 
 to serve overseas the subsequent acceptance of the offer by colonel sam hughes the minister of militia the naming of 
 the unit after her royal highness the princess patricia of connaught the daughter of the governor general and the choice 
 of lieutenant colonel farquhar the governor general s military secretary as the first commanding officer all these happenings 0:happen 0:ings 
 are well known the history of the regiment has been recorded in such diverse publications as mopping up a dog 
 story of the princess pats by lieutenant jack munro new york 1918 which is told through the eyes of the 
 dog bobbie burns regimental mascot and contingent ditties by sergeant frank f brown ppcli london 1915 which is a volume

 the founding and details of the actions of the ppcli in 1914 1915 as the first canadian battalion into action 
 in world war i it must be observed that the armed forces of canada 1867 1967 ottawa 1967 by g 
 j goodspeed scarcely mentions the founding and while g f g stanley s canada s soldiers toronto 0:toron 0:to 1954 
 1960 1974 does not dwell at length on the raising of the regiment the pertinent facts are noted recently frances

 with the regiment and their effects upon his life books written by patricias include execution by colin mcdougall toronto 1958 
 a world war ii novel set in italy which although a work of fiction the 2nd rifles in the book 
 is really the ppcli it received the governor general s award in 1958 and was called by the montreal star 
 a very readable novel with a sense of action and excitement while the new york times noted that mcdougall s 
 work was an exceptionally 0:exceptional 0:ly good war novel another is lcol doc corrigan s tales of a forgotten theatre 
 winnipeg 1969 a most amusing collection of stories about an anonymous unit in italy written by the ppcli medical officer

 one of the famous regiments series and the only book in the series to have sold its entire printing this 
 work covers the years 1914 1976 these examples seem to illustrate that the exploits of the ppcli have been brought 
 to the attention of the country on a broad and varied front what remains to be mentioned are the volumes 
 of history which illustrate in detail the deeds and exploits 0:ex 0:ploits of our regiment and of our fellow patricias 
 to date the regiment has published four volumes of regimental history and has reprinted two volumes princess patricia s canadian 
 light infantry 1914 1919 by ppcli lieutenant ralph hodder williams was published in two volumes in 1923 and is today 
 a collector s item demanding a high price if any volumes for sale can be located volume ii contains the 
 names of those who paid the supreme sacrifice and the roll of honour is prefaced by the greek quote for 
 a common cause they gave their lives for themselves they won the crown that never fades other appendices of this 
 second volume deal with correspondence relative to the founding decorations awarded and a complete nominal roll and record of service 
 of the officers warrant officers ncos and men who served with p p c l i in the field the 
 first volume called the narrative carries the reader from august 1914 to march 1919 in her forward our first colonel 
 in chief noted that one of the traditions of the regiment 0:regi 0:ment was the effacement of the individual in 
 securing the advancement of the unit after paying a tribute to the heroism of her soldiers princess patricia concluded that 
 the book will have served a noble purpose if it brings comfort and pride to those whose nearest and dearest 
 fell fighting in the ranks of princess patricia s canadian light infantry the founder contributed an introduction which dealt with 
 the difficulties 0:dif 0:ficulties of preparing the narratives of a unit engaged throughout the late war and he explained the 
 sources used and the methods employed to ensure the accuracy of the text he concluded with the following two paragraphs 
 which are so composed and are of such value that they must be quoted in full these volumes are published 
 with a threefold purpose it is thought that they may prove of interest to the student of military history as 
 a guide to some problems of infantry tactics 0:tac 0:tics in modern warfare it is believed that they will serve 
 as a memorial of comradeship in the field for survivors of the service battalion but most especially is it hoped 
 that the story of the regiment in which so many gallant comrades laid down their lives at the call of 
 country may be a source of consolation to the proudly sorrowing hearts of their relatives and friends and that the 
 memory of the great deeds in which the regiment played its part will point the way to duty for countless 
 generations of canadians yet unborn 0:un 0:born for nearly four years in the forefront of the battle princess patricia s 
 canadian light infantry from oldest veteran to latest joined recruit never faltered never wavered each officer and man steadfast in 
 his purpose ever ready to sacrifice himself for his regiment s need such was the undying spirit of our fallen 
 comrades living on in the hearts of those who came to fill the ranks and such is the regiment s 
 proud tradition left as an imperishable heritage to canada the narrative is some 411 pages in length and covers in 
 great detail the actions of the regiment battles are described in an engaging manner and individuals are mentioned both against 
 the back drop of the particular engagement and for the influence their actions had on others each chapter concludes with 
 a listing of those who distinguished themselves and were 
 72 awarded decorations maps are of the fold out type and there are full page illustrations of commanding officers these 
 first two volumes called the excellent two volume study by one reviewer were reprinted in one volume in 1968 but 
 without appendices 0:ap 0:pendices v and vi of the original second volume the nominal roll and list of attached officers 
 the last copies of the reprint have just recently been sold volume 111 of our history appeared in 1958 and 
 was written by colonel g r stevens obe colonel stevens was a member of the 2nd mcgiii university company his 
 regimental number was meg 85 and joined the regiment in the field in september 1915 he was wounded on june 
 2 1916 promoted from sergeant to lieutenant at the beginning of june 1917 gassed at the end of october 1917 
 and was struck off strength on march 20 1919 this volume also contains a forward by our first colonel in 
 chief and an introduction by the founder colonel 0:col 0:onel stevens had the awesome task of laying out that part 
 of our history which took place between 1919 and 1958 and all in the space of some 400 pages writing 
 in the summer 1959 issue of the dalhousie review d j goodspeed mentioned that although regimental histories are undoubtedly written 
 for specialized audiences the members ex members and friends of unit this book perhaps has a somewhat more general interest 
 from the august day in 1914 when mr later brigadier hamilton gault offered to raise and equip a battalion 0:bat 
 0:talion at his own expense until the present the princess patricia s canadian light infantry has been something of a 
 canadian tradition commenting upon col stevens treatment 0:treat 0:ment of the regiment in world war 11 he finds that the 
 account 0:ac 0:count of this crucial period appears to be accurate and objective 0:objec 0:tive certain it is that no 
 one would wish to find fault with goodspeed s assessment the fourth volume in the continuing story of the ppcli 
 was compiled by major r b mainprize a former commanding officer of our regimental depot and was sponsored by the 
 ppcli association a massive undertaking it records the regimental number name date of joining the regiment and regimental record of 
 each officer and man who served with the regiment between 1939 1945 a total of 3 687 personnel the roll 
 of honour is listed as well as tables showing numbers of decorations and awards and casualty figures there have been 
 other ppcli historical ventures in addition 0:addi 0:tion to published books the regimental newsletter was started in june 1969 again 
 a successor to earlier newsletters with the purpose of keeping regimental members up to date on one another s progress 
 it is issued four times per year the patrician is an annual magazine style publication and contains 0:con 0:tains feature 
 articles reports from each battalion of the regiment 0:regi 0:ment and other units in which patricias find themselves and news 
 of affiliated army cadet corps and allied units the ppcli association also contributes an up date on its activities the 
 first patrician was printed in may 1933 but was the successor of an earlier journal called ppcli quarterly review which 
 was first published in 1923 another exercise of a historical nature is exercise ric a dam doo which is held 
 annually the purpose is to bring together all newly commissioned officers and by a series of presentations by knowledgeable regimental 
 figures to instill in them a sense of regimental pride and history each of these ventures accomplishes its aim quite 
 well and contributes to the necessary maintenance and furtherance 0:fur 0:therance of the regimental family in early 1980 the regimental 
 executive commissioned the writer of this article to be the author of volume v of our regimental history to be 
 published on the occasion of our 70th anniversary in 1984 volume v will cover the years 1953 to mid 1980 
 it will expand on colonel stevens coverage of the post korea years and will deal extensively with among other themes 
 canada in nato integration and unification peacekeeping aid of the civil power and assistance to civil authorities the place of 
 the regiment in canadian society will be established and our history for this period will be discussed in the context 
 of national and military policy of course appropriate and due attention will be devoted to individuals 0:in 0:dividuals and their 
 participation in the various operations exercises 0:ex 0:ercises and ceremonial occasions in which the regiment has taken part activities accomplished 
 to date have included the preparation and approval of terms of reference two drafts of a writing plan and a 
 meeting with individuals and groups of patricias in ottawa winnipeg calgary and victoria research has been conducted at the dnd 
 directorate of history and the public archives of canada the september 1980 issue of the regimental newsletter contained an announcement 
 of the project as well as a series of questions designed to bring out the main themes of our post 
 korea history and to help assess the weight which should be assigned to each one a thematic approach to volume 
 v has been judged to be more appropriate than one which follows a mere chronological template it will be appreciated 
 that to trace the events and movements of a number of battalions and the depot over a period of thirty 
 years using a strict year by year approach would be unimaginative and would soon become boring the adoption of themes 
 as adjustment to peace time soldiering in canada following korea service in germany ceremonial events the place of rhq and 
 other internal organizations the part played by the founder our colonel in chief and our colonels of the regiment as 
 well as those other themes listed above will ensure that all of importance will be included a pictorial section and 
 an index will round out the volume an editorial committee has been formed to assist the author in his work 
 to guide him and to review the manuscript at various stages the assistance of general brown general dechastelain the regimental 
 executive and the editorial committee has been helpful and encouraging and public acknowledgement is well rendered it is to be 
 hoped that all who have ideas information or suggestions concerning the years 1953 1980 and on the content 0:con 0:tent 
 and structure of volume v will contact the author by making 0:mak 0:ing the writing a co operative effort our 
 knowledge about our regiment and our fellow patricias will increase and thereby ensure that in 1984 will be published a 
 book in which we can collectively and individually take pride major w a morrison ppcli is a graduate in history

 73 amsterdam dankt zijn canadezen amsterdam thanks her canadians by mrs grace mainprize re entry into amsterdam 5 may 1980 
 it was a proud and exhilarating time to be a canadian thirty five years after the liberation 350 veterans and 
 their spouses had been invited back to join with the amsterdammers 0:amsterdam 0:mers and indeed all the dutch people to 
 commemorate the end of the nazi tyranny the hunger for they were literally being 0:be 0:ing starved into oblivion the 
 despair on 5 may 1945 the canadians entered and liberated amsterdam one cannot visualize what this great day meant to 
 those people and so 35 years later the soldiers came back at the invitation 0:in 0:vitation of amsterdam and the 
 response was overwhelming now we could see for ourselves what it must have been like on that day but first 
 a slight indication of the efficiency and administrative 0:ad 0:ministrative effort of the amsterdam committee greeted each veteran on the 
 plane as we left vancouver and in the case of eastern canadians montreal each was presented with a large brown 
 envelope containing a detailed schedule of our netherlands activities even a tie for each veteran tastefully and especially made for 
 this occasion in the centre of which was a small red maple leaf and the three crosses of amsterdam 0:amster 
 0:dam the emblem with which we were to become familiar in the coming week it was the logo the symbol 
 which joined our country and that city and we saw it everywhere the canadians were billetted with dutch families a 
 particularly 0:par 0:ticularly sensitive plan for how better can one get to know the people and their way of living 
 we were fortunate indeed to have as our hosts a jewish couple living in the lovely suburb of amstelveen from 
 all our various activities we were bussed to a square in that suburb and from there picked up and delivered 
 by our hosts a rather onerous task especially on some nights when our dinner ran late it was done gladly 
 and happily in fact most veterans found that their hosts could not do enough for them the terms of the 
 surrender were read to the german commander 0:com 0:mander by gen foulkes on evening 5 may 45 in the small 
 village of wageningen the formal surrender of the german forces at large was signed at rheims france on 7 may 
 45 the bth was the official ye day after a greatly appreciated day of rest on our arrival the festivities 
 started on the 3rd of may after a welcoming luncheon 0:lun 0:cheon and a canal boat trip the highlight was 
 an evening of music at the amsterdam concert hall accompanied by our hosts it was a brilliant plan for it 
 cemented a togetherness that in most cases was to last we all enjoyed the music of the amsterdam symphony orchestra 
 and the amsterdam opera choir and each other s company and by the time the amsterdam 0:amster 0:dam police band 
 entertained us with their brand of lively and lovely music we found ourselves on our feet doing a conga line 
 up and down the aisles canadians and amsterdammers were caught up in a joyous musical jubilation later we learned 0:learn 
 0:ed from our hosts that we had done the polonaise never before done in the elegant concertgebouw and unlikely ever 
 to be done again the regimental wreath left to right j h moore w kusyk and g howe after this 
 rousing beginning the next day s main feature was solemn and serious each year the amsterdammers commemorate 0:com 0:memorate on 
 the 4th of may the silent procession and this year the canadians joined them starting at the weteringcircuit 0:weteringcir 0:cuit 
 where dutch patriots were shot by the germans and a stark statue now rests the dutch people started in a 
 quiet and solemn procession to walk the two miles or more to dam square during the walk all traffic stopped 
 all joyousness ceased we felt deeply the reverence of the occasion the only sound heard in the two miles was 
 the slight shuffle of feet and the occasional jingling of medals crowds of quiet people were already at dam square 
 when we arrived to watch the wreathlaying 0:wreath 0:laying the next day sth of may was an explosion of joy 
 this was the day of the liberation the canadian veterans mounted vehicles from world war ii at the belage bridge 
 and just as in 1945 rumbled through the streets to dam square and just as then the huge and happy 
 crowds greeted them with handshakes kisses flowers presents and tears the older ones pressed forward some with tears streaming down 
 their cheeks saying thank you thank you we will never forget what you did for us those words are what 
 we heard again and again for the next few days the incredible gratitude of the dutch people young and old 
 and after 35 years is what stays in one s mind and is something that all canadians should know later 
 as we strolled in the square people would come up to us and shake my husband s hand saying those 
 same words one woman in her 40s most vocal and articulate told us that although she was only 8 years 
 old at the time and remembered very little never would she forget the hunger pains in her belly never never 
 will i forget that and how 
 74 grateful we were to see the canadians come she exclaimed thank you thank you from the bottom of my 
 heart at dam square where the vehicles and veterans finally emerged through the crowds a children s choir shouted hooray 
 hooray hooray at the sight of them a thousand doves were released and thousands of red white and blue balloons 
 people hung from windows stood precariously on roof tops the maple leaf together with the netherlands flags fluttered proudly in 
 the breeze british columbia s lieutenant governor brigadier general bell irving who had commanded the seaforths then and who took 
 over control of the german forces was the senior member of the canadians and cut a handsome figure in his 
 kilt as he was greeted by the mayor of amsterdam and other dignitaries the swirl of kilt and bagpipes of 
 the seaforth highlanders of canada from vancouver was evident at most functions always greeted with great enthusiasm and here was 
 no exception from this great and glorious occasion the veterans and their spouses entered the royal palace into the grandeur 
 of the civic hall for a 45 minute reception with the former queen now princess juliana there was not time 
 of course for her to meet everyone outside then we went and across the square for a late luncheon the 
 crowds were still there parting to make a pathway for us across the square they applauded and cheered it was 
 interesting to note that these men who had braved german bullets and guns in their younger days now were not 
 quite sure what to do about all the adulation looking down at their feet then up at the crowds they 
 smiled shyly as if to say who me canadians are a self effacing lot emerging from the luncheon we found 
 the crowds still there and applauding again with a half hour of free time before embussing most of us strolled 
 and window shopped stopping for conversations as mentioned before and when finally we got on our buses there they were 
 those marvellous amsterdammers shouting clapping seeming not to want to let us go us was this really for us now 
 back on our buses some of us wondered if we would ever be able to come back down to earth 
 again had this taste of glory gone to our heads you bet we loved it patricia s at keukenhof on

 0:dam committee brighton fraser john klassen missing lloyd rains the next day all 13 busloads of us went to keukenhof 
 the area of bulb growers and the beautiful sculptured gardens and at the height of tulip season it was a 
 feast for the eyes with a motorcycle escort of 6 white jacketed policemen we were whistled through the city through 
 red lights and traffic a real people stopper we got waves and kisses blown along the way and again applause 
 at the gardens canadezen we would hear the murmur and the applause ripple through the miles of paths through the 
 stunning beds of tulips and small lakes led us with the assistance of red and white signs keukenhof salutes canada 
 to a complex of joined greenhouses and a rousing reception inside a large bed of vivid red tulips in the 
 shape of a maple leaf was the immediate centre of attention and photography buffs with four pretty dutch girls in 
 the local costume under the two national flags was a setting that formed the centrepiece for this afternoon a huge 
 arrangement of beautiful rose red tulips this was the tulip grown and named especially for the canadians and named 0:nam 
 0:ed the bell irving tulip a great honour indeed not to freely or often bestowed the canadian cemetery at groesbeek 
 just outside of nijmegen 0:ni 0:jmegen may 7th found us early on the buses for a visit to the canadian 
 war cemetery at groesbeek in one of the few hilly areas of the country the beautifully kept cemetery was the 
 focal point as well as our own entourage crowds of dutch people were streaming from far and near in cars 
 on bicycles on foot another large group of canadian veterans joined us there they had been visiting mostly in the 
 nijmegen area their senior member was mgen chris yokes known and admired 0:ad 0:mired by many of our soldiers queen 
 beatrix and princess juliana dressed in black led the procession to the cenotaph where a solemn ceremony took place on 
 the hilltop of this quiet and lovely part of holland wreaths were laid including many various canadian units and regiments 
 row on row of white gravestones marked the places where our young men were buried small rosebushes and lovely 0:love 
 0:ly primroses were planted and immaculately kept three single red tulips marked each grave a ceremony that the local dutch 
 schoolchildren carry out every year in early may the next evening the bth of may was our farewell dinner held 
 at the hilton hotel at every function and dinner we had been struck by the outstanding floral arrangements but the 
 dutch outdid themselves this time everywhere one looked was a lovelier arrangement with the colour predominantly yellow in the centre 
 of the massive dining room extended on long ribbon ropes hung four gigantic balls of bright yellow and orange flowers 
 a breathtaking sight 
 75 in spite of the gaiety there was an underlying sadness that this marked the conclusion of an emotion packed 
 week of joy and tears of new found and lasting friendships not only had we gained some new and close 
 dutch friends but amongst the canadians we had renewed old friendships and found new ones far removed from our vast 
 country as we left the hotel confetti and streamers showered down on us and to illustrate the unbelievable attention to 
 detail and thoughtfulness that the amsterdam committee continually showed on the buses were bouquets of tulips for each couple to 
 take home to their hosts the 350 veterans only a small representation of the troops there at the time felt 
 honoured and indeed overwhelmed 0:overwhelm 0:ed at the incredible reception they were given we feel very strongly that all canadians 
 should be made aware of some of the main happenings of the week 2 9 may 80 and should know 
 in what high esteem canadians are held in holland our host took pains to explain to us at the outset 
 a fact to which we had never given much thought you canadians he said were not protecting or fighting to 
 free your own homeland you were half way around the world helping to liberate us total strangers that is partly 
 why we honour you and rejoice that some of you are here among us 4i ktf tteuuf lii ponce t
