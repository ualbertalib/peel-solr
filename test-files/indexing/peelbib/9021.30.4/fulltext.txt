 which are now the hunting grounds of the above south west alberta and at that time blackfoot indians ie the
 blackfoot were formerly in full indian territory had earlier been occupied by the possession of the kootenaes northward the next
 kutenai indians it was believed that as a result the saleesh ie flathead and their allies and of the blackfoot
 drive into their region of foothills the most southern the snake indians shoshoni and plains following the intr oduction of
 firearms and their tribes now driven across the mounthe kutenai together with neighbouring flathead tains 2 thompson s information was
 most likely and shoshoni indian groups had been forced to derived from traditions of the blackfoot indians retreat across the
 rocky mountains with whom he spent a winter as early as 1787 this explanation has come to be a generally
 alexander henry an associate of thompson s accepted tenet of plains plateau ethnohistory wrote in 1811 along the clearwater a
 little effort has been made to examine the valid tributary of the north saskatchewan and near ity of this assumption
 or to determine exactly the foot of the mountains are still to be seen the what territory east of the
 rockies had been abandoned by the kutenai and other plateau groups dr schaeffer spent a lifetime studying the flathead kutenai
 and blackfoot indians he was curator of david thompson the noted north west com the museum of the plains indian

 comment upon changes in ethnic field work among the indians after his death in 1969 occupancy of the south western
 alberta foothills his papers were given to the glenbow archives this article is based upon an unedited manuscript which in
 his narrative wntten years after his ex he was working on at the time of his passing above periences from
 1787 to 1811 in the west is a water colour painting of a kutenai camp on the thompson stated that
 the kutenai used to be in plains near fort macleod in 1875 full possession of the hunting grounds in the

 which the remains of their far as the sweetgrass hills most if not all of lodges are still to be
 seen 3 he goes on to say the country now comprised in the blood reserve that about the time the
 kootenays were in and the blackfeet reservation in montana possession of this part of the country the snare belonged at
 one time to them he said there were indians dwelt on the kootenay or columbia two bands with separate chiefs

 language was distinctly kutenai them off the land the kootenays now inhabit 4 and could be understood by them the

 the plains kutenai bands living near kutenai in 1892 says that we are given the browning was struck by an
 epidemic possibly reasons for believing that the kootenays formerly smallpox all of the group died except nine who lived east
 of the rocky mountains and were became well through the ministrations of a young driven thence by the blackfoot tribes

 of the region attributes the smallpox also investigated the question of the origin of the stor y to the plains
 flathead rather than the plains kutenai he states that the best information kutenai he identified a band he called tunaha
 boils down to not only an eastern provenience who he believed were plains flathead on the for the kutenai but
 even a trans rocky mounbasis of certain words of their language surviv tam one 2 that here is a strong
 tradition even ing among elderly flathead men at the time of at bonner s feny that the whole body of
 the his field work prior to 1911 he stated that kutenai originated on the great plains and at when the

 never interupted bands this information consists of scattered one of the early flathead chiefs according to remnants mostly to their
 economic li fe and curtis was a survivor of the plains flathead movements a few details bearing upon such tribe
 he states that the tribal memory of the topics as courtship organization or raids early flathead reaches back no farther
 than the time kutenai cree contacts and kutenai shoshoni of the head chief skuti hla big hawk near the relations

 azov on august 2 1862 when he was 13 his parents emigrated to manitoba his family was part of the
 group of 6 000 mennonites which moved to he reserves in manitoba between 1874 and 1879 he remained on the
 farm until he was 21 when he left to serve as an apprentice and later as manager with the general
 merchandise firm of e pepper co after working for this company for four years he joined his brother who was
 in the general merchandise business at pilot mound manitoba and remained with him for two years he then opened a
 store on his own in gretna manitoba which he oper ated for four years he then sold out and became
 secretary treasurer of the municipality of rinland manitoba where he was to stay for two years before moving to altona
 to resume his former business as a general merchant this business was under the firm name of heppner loepky hiebert

 the rest of the group as less open to change than either the mennonite brethren in christ or the old
 mennonites having lived in canada for only twenty years with the excepdon ofafew men like cornelius hiebert they had lived
 all of these years under the influence of the mennonite communitive exclusiveness in the reserves of southern manitoba the arrival

 notable citizens of the town were commemorated by the new world thefreedom diversity anonymity and excitement of urban life mennonites
 felt would encourage hedonism while the rural pattern of living with its stress on hard work strong informal social controls
 and lack of opportunity for dissipation would promote self denial and restraint the first mennonites settlers to come to the
 didsbury area were of swiss german background and had lived in waterloo county ontario they were members of the mennonite
 brethem in christ who had been expelled from the old mennonite church because they had accepted some of the religious
 practices of non mennonite churches in july 1892 jacob y shantz who had played a prominent role along with william
 hespeler in arranging for the immigration of the mennonites from russia to manitoba in the 1 870 s came west

 a showcase in the toronto exhibition building in the early 1920 s the placard beside the exhibit stated that this
 37 pound fleece had been sent there by r c harvey of lethbridge alberta shorn from one of his own
 rams there were many questions regarding this exceptionally heavy fleece and the answers were all in the life s work
 of one man richard coope harvey was a man of vision one who dreamed big his small farm in center
 creek utah was not extensive enough for the f ulfillment of his dreams not even bit enough to provide for
 his family of six boys and girls and his wife millie one day in the winter of 1899 1900 he
 found a pamphlet which told of the lush gr asslands and broad open prairies of canada this fired his imagination
 with the possibilities that such a location would open up to him he and millie read and reread the pamphlet
 and while she dreaded the thought of leaving their friends and the little home in the lovely valley she knew
 of richard s ambitions and she trusted his judgement the r llarve decision made they planned to move immediately again
 the family loaded their possessions into wagons and a buggy and headed for stirling on the 16 th of april
 1900 on a cold stormy with the livestock being driven behind they night they arrived in the little town of
 stirling settled on a farm six miles south of stirling on n w t with the aid of a friend
 returning to his the etzikom coulee and here in a little valley home in stirling the family was settled for
 the beside a spring of fresh water they pitched their night richard tied up his horses but had to herd

 at first with two miles west where he had leased a small farm more added later one of which was
 built of old but this place was not a satisfactory answer to railroad ties about seven years later they built
 his problem and later when he was advised to a larger home with five bedrooms and the settle in the
 stirling area he sold his lease ob neighbours talked much about the five thousand taming in payment three cows and
 a ton of oats dollar home harvey was building he now had 38 cows thirty eight cattle could not provide

 hundred coln cross was not the answer to his problem head with careful management and successful he had lost a
 year but the experience pinpointed breeding this would offer him a way by which some of the qualities his ideal
 breed of sheep he could provide for his growing family as well must have as contribute to the growth and
 development of being firm in his decision to upgrade his the country that was now his home flocks he experimented
 with other breeds and but there were losses the winter of 1902 03 studied the characteristics of the corriedale the
 was perhaps the worst winter ever to visit that chevoit dorset hampshire oxford southpart of canada a blizzard that lasted
 for days down shropshire and suffolk but each of these drove the livestock many miles and after the seemed to

 secured being added during the season all stockmen to the bottom blade at the end below the hot were faced
 with the necessity to buy feed for their tom blade was an iron bar about 2 ½ inches wide livestock
 from wherever it could be obtained a half inch thick and about five inches long harvey went to great lengths
 to feed his 25 000 heated by a blowtorch it was so positioned that sheep an almost impossible task he
 borrowed when the top blade was moved downward and heavily from the bank to finance this operation the lamb docked
 it would move upward and but when spring came about half of the sheep would sear the stub of tail
 thus stopping hemor had perished and he was in debt to the bank for rhage and infection this docking machine
 was about a quarter of a million dollars getting this soon recognized as a solution to the problem and loan
 paid off was now his aim and he spent many sheepmen bought them when they were put on nights filled
 with worry the market in a search for feed for his sheep at a price that perhaps the hardest and

 for the fatper of wool in canada and he received the tening of sheep highest price during world war one

 the possibility of shipping his panics now saw a sale for the screenings and spring lambs to fort william for

 the problems was feed the range made to ship 6 000 head of sheep to be fattened grass was not
 sufficient also the market was there they had no shelter except a high board declining on top of all this
 there was the everfence through the severe winter but there were present pressure from the bank to get the large
 no losses or setbacks on account of the weather loan paid off this was enough to take the heart tons
 of feed were hauled by wagon and water out of any man and most would have buckled was plentiful under
 the strain many of the ranchers took ad the feeding program was very successful and vantage of the law and
 took steps to get out from the fattened lambs were in strong demand in the under their obligations to the
 banks one man toronto and buffalo markets the going price who was indebted to the bank for 6 00 per
 head for lambs was 13 to 14 but these sheep sold of his sheep surrendered them and the bank at
 a premium 15 h p kennedy of the toron manager had no option but to accept them he to union
 stockyards said they are by long then asked this rancher to manage the sheep for odds the most evenly finished
 animals handled them on a salary basis which he refused to do in many years not only did these sheep
 come saying if i care for anyone s sheep they must to the market at just the right time but
 they were be my own finally the bank sold them back fattened to perfection carrying the exact amount to him
 for 3 00 per head but harvey was a man of fat required the profit that year was 8 75
 of principle and he did not think such a method per head of getting from under a debt was honest
 he was determined to pay back every dollar he owed the next year 1922 harvey shipped 10 000 sheep which
 included 3 000 he purchased of while much of the drive and enthusiasm had which 2 000 were old ewes
 the elevator com been taken out of him he worked day and night try ing to get back on a
 sound basis and to get the sheep and sell them this was done at a great out of debt he
 sold the lamb crop the older ewes loss to harvey but the bank was paid off in full and many
 rams each year as well as the wool and he was left with about 2 000 head of the but
 all the prices had fallen romnellets and with the chin ranch one year pat burns came to see him and
 ask for two years he struggled trying to recover ed to buy his spring lambs when they were ready from
 this staggering financial loss but later sold the price was agreed upon and they shook hands the chin ranch and
 in october 1934 he movand that was the contract in the fall the sheep ed the sheep to kelowna b
 c he had come in were shipped to calgar y and when harvey went contact with a man by the
 name of casorso who to the office for his payment the manager said owned a large part of what was
 known as black sorry mr harvey but the price of lambs has mountain here they could run the sheep as
 there gone down and we can t pay your price harvey was an abundance of good feed so a kind
 of partsaid let me speak to pat pat was in a near nership was arrived at where casorso was to
 get by office and on hearing the discussion he came part of the sheep for the use of his land
 but there out he said to his office manager we will pay were unforeseen problems beside the fact that mr
 harvey the price agreed upon give him a bears roamed the hills and killed many of the cheque for the
 payment in full contracts at that sheep this was a far cry from the operation on time confirmed by the
 shaking of hands were the alberta ranches stocked with 25 000 head of seemingly more binding than many written con

 particulars of his alterations at the cave the tunnel is now completed into the cave and is about 100 ft
 in length the basin of water has been enlarged to almost double of its natural size and all the fragments
 and angularities of rock have been taken out so that the bottom is as smooth as possible and there will
 be an average depth of four feet of water all around the circular basin of water there will be a
 platform which will give great facilities to bathers as much of the natural beauty of the cave as possible is
 to be preserved the stalactites depending from the roof are to be cleaned and polished so that when the electric
 light is introduced they will glisten with great brilliancy immediately at the entrance to the tunnel a building is to
 be erected giving ample accommodation for separate ladies and gentlemen s waiting and dressing rooms elegantly furnished attendants are to
 be engaged whose duty it will be to preserve perfect order and keep everything scrupulously clean and a nominal charge
 of 10 cents each will be made for bath tickets only a certain number of bathers will be allowed in
 the cave at once and probably alternate hours will be allowed for ladies and gentlemen mr stewart believes the scheme
 will give entire satisfaction and that the cave will become the most popular bathing place in the national park he
 expects also that the temperature will be heightened by the alterations calgary tribune april 22 1887 western bookshelf alberta 1943
