 s bay company was very much a family affair at the top level the principal shareholders and members of the
 lcndon committee were often related by bicod or marriage in rupert s land sons followed their fathers in the company
 service even unto the fifth generation brothers served under the red h b c ensign sometimes for twenty years without
 seeing each other cousins entered the honourable ccmpany s service on the same day and followed parallel courses through the
 ranks of apprenticed clerks and commissioned gentlemen until they retired as chief factors or chief traders uncles recommended their favorite
 nephews to the london committee or to the governor of rupert s land yet good connections although they might open
 the door to opportunity provided no guarantee of preferment governor simpson found places in the com any s ranks for
 his own part indian sons but they advanced only to the degree that their own qualifications permitted and none ever
 reached commissioned rank george simpson was father to more real the governor sent it to england via than the children

 the deep and abiding hatred of a the hudson s bay company had a son for a harsh unyielding and
 un very firm policy concerning the responloving father others looked upon him sibilities of its servants and officers towith respect

 weeks after they left fort edmonton both settled at cobcurg upper canada she and wallace were drowned when where simpson
 visited her on cccctsion their over loaded canoe capsized in when she lost her husband he sent boiling rapids of
 the columbia river her money and advised her on the management cf her property until a second blood relationships often

 governor s own cousins their talents and inclinations pormitted found them positions in the company thomas simpson was born in
 1808 and remembered them in his will by the time he was twenty he had graduated as a master of
 arts frcm tantalizingly incomplete rcccrds sug king s ccllege aberdeen after a brilgest that even when simpson was first liant
 academic career in 1829 he enliving with margaret taylcr almost as tered the company s service as his soon as
 he reached ruport s land his cousin the governor had been urging affection for her did nct blind him to
 him to do for several years the young the charms of cther young women in scholar rose rapidly in the
 company s 1839 john rowand wrote to a friend ranks serving first as the governor s secretary then being given
 increasingly but stop i have a piece of news heavy responsibilities in the early to tell you which will surprise
 cu 1830 s he spent five years as manager you must know that miss maria of the red river colony
 this period simpson was married here last fall ccincided more or less with simpson s to a mr robert wallace
 during their own residence at the stone fort and stay at norway house last summer therefore thomas saw a great
 deal of they did not only get acquatnted his illustrious kinsman he was not imbut madly in lcve who promised
 pressed their heart and hand to each other before leaving that place and all his excellency miscalculates i could say
 to miss i could not per when he expects to get more out of suade her to wait to get
 a fathers pecple by sheer driving by assumconsent no she wculd be mrs wal ing a harsh manner towards me
 he lace coute que caute that business should have known that the had caused me much uneasiness necessary effect on
 a young and and yet i do not feel comfortable genercus mind would be a recipro god knows i acted
 icr the best still cal repulsiveness perhaps hatred perhaps our friend the governor but i know his real sentiments and
 will blame me all i have to forgive his apparent though untell you is that i was very sorry to
 necessary unkindness i will not see her attach to a man she had conceal from you that on a nearer
 seen for a shcrt time only all the view of his character than i before gentlemen who were here were
 of had i lost much of that internal reone opinion it was bet ier they spect i entertained towards him
 should be united and so they were his firmness and decision of mind are much impaired both in great and
 small matters he has become wavering capricious and changeable he has grown painfully nervous and crabbed and is guilty cf
 many little meannesses at the table which are quite beneath a gentleman and i might add are indicative of his
 birth near the end of december 1834 an incident occurred which deepened the antipathy between the governor and his cousin
 one day a drunken young halfbreed entered thomas simpson s office and demanded an advance cn his pay account this
 was refused as the man was already over drawn when he became impudent thomas simpson ordered him out of his
 office the man refusing to go simpson threw him out bodily giving him a bloody nose and a black eye
 in the process when the incident became known the half breeds considered it an insult to their race they called
 on governor simpson to demand that his cousin be publicly flogged the governor unable to pacify the incensed half breeds
 at last gave them a barrel of rum and some money and promised that his young relative would be transferred
 out of the settlement thomas simpson felt that the governor had betrayed him and threatened to resign if he were
 sent to another post at this point on new year s eve sir george simpson was one of the outstanding
 men of the fur trade this photograph is from an engraving which was made by james scott in 1857 it
 was taken from a painting by stephen pearce self into the task with enthusiasm but when the expedition set out
 in 1836 not the young thomas simpson but the elderly peter warren dease was in charge the young man was
 disappointed he knew that he pcssessed the energy and enthusiasm the courage and daring of youth that he was trained
 in science and mathematics and had mastered the arts of surveying and navigation perhaps he did not realize that dease
 too had much to contribute years of experience alexander simpson came from moose factory to visit thomas tension was so
 high that for ten days the brothers slept behind barricaded doors their weapons by their bed gradually tempers cooled thomas
 simpson remained at the settlement and the unpleasantness was apparently forgotten soon however thomas simpson was to leave the red
 river settlement to begin the most important work of his short lifetime through two centuries hundreds of miles of north
 america s arctic coast had been mapped but there were still many blank spaces on the charts the hudson s
 bay company offered to send an expedition to complete the exploration and fill in those empty spaces when the british
 government accepted this offer governor simpson in 1835 appointed his young cousin to organize it thomas threw himin living in
 the north and the knowledge of exnloration cmained thrcugh service with capt john franklin however thomas simpson despite his disappointment
 loyally served as second incommand to the old fur trader the three year odyssey of the dease simpscn expedition remains
 one of the finest chapters in the story of arctic exploration hundreds of miles cf coastline were surveyed the blank
 spaces on the map were filled in largely through the efforts of young simpson he returned to fort garry eager
 to lead his own expedition to the land of the midnight sun and to achieve the was over alexander simpson
 shocked goal which had just eluded him that of and saddened by his brother s murder defining the north west
 passage yet tried to secure some recognition from the governor was unenthusiastic later the ccmpany and from the british gov
 alexander simpson claimed that cousin ernment of thomas achievements but george threw cold water on the pro most of his
 efforts were in vain his pcsal out of jealously for his young failure created a bitterness between the cousin at
 last however the london governor and himself that lasted as long committee approved the idea but by as they both
 lived then it was too late the fourth decade of the century was beicre the approval arrived from lon a
 trying one for the governor early in don governor simpson ordered thomas the decade his infant son had died and
 home to london on june 6 1840 the both his own and his wife s health had young explcrer set
 out accompanied been poor he had lost substantial sums by some half breeds intending to travel in a business venture
 and only finanby way of the united states a few days cial stringencies had prevented him later two of his
 dark skinned com frcm resigning from a demanding and panicns returned with the shocking uncongenial position to all these trials
 news that two half breeds and simp were added misunderstandings and son had died violently they claimed bitterness between himself
 and his two that simpson had gone suddenly and cousins violently insane killing himself and his fellow travellers yet many
 circum however by the end of the ‘ 30 s the stances pointed the grim finger of sun had again
 begun to shine for suspicion at the half breeds themselves george simpson the queen knighted they suggested that thomas simpson
 him in 1841 pcssibly for his part in the had been attacked in retribution for his dease simpson expedition the
 honoursix year old manhandling of a member able company also paid tribute to its of their people that he had
 defended chief servant designating him govhimself killing two of his attackers but ernor in chief of rupert s land to
 mark had been overcome by wounds su the occasion simpson s fur trade family stained in the attack or assassinated

 the presenta patterned himself after the stern old ticn some refrained from active dislike testament patriarch or roman pateror even
 stronger feelings towards their familias yet in both company and perchief others perhaps like thomas sonal matters he seemed to
 emulate simpson paid their share because they these grim models demanding high did not want to be conspicuously absent standards
 of performance rewarding if the company was one big family it and punishing according to merit and was not necessarily
 always a happy yet when justice had gone as far as one it could go perhaps the stern and dour

 from the point where justice stopped early days in alberta by marianne m molyneaux on my father s side i
 trace my ancestry back nearly two hundred years to a baby boy rescued by a parish priest from a ship
 from the miquelon islands that had drcpped anchor at a small settlement on the banks of the st lawrence st
 gregcire most cf the passengers on board had died en route of the dreaded cholera among those left was the
 baby boy none knew his name as he had been orphaned by the plague the priest took him in charge
 and had him cared for they called him petit meaning little miquelon when this boy grew up he investigated the

 girl to help with the for a living and a future and very few housework and an indian woman to
 do people who could spare 100 00 for this the washing as i remember my mather work the little two

 in the 1890 s was a pioneer town on the calgary and edmonton flailwcsy at right is a single large
 elevator while the main part of the town faces the tracks on the left think pat burns would have enjoyed
 the beauties of the old province and told that story me about her village assuring me that i would love
 it all dad and mother i remember dad and the men of the agreed that i should go and i
 did town fighting prairie fires with sacks dipped in barrels of water we were the convent i attended was about

 spots was lucas were being laid the only familiar spot grove a few miles from town on the to me
 was st mary s cathedral pipestone creek there was and still is a blockhouse there which we called the we
 were there for fair week there fort mr lucas was the first white man was a parade in which were
 depicted to farm in the wetaskiwin district the old and the new on one float was a log shack on
 another a modern bun during the winter we skated while our dads curled saw an occasional galow there were red
 river carts and modern carriages indians in all their magic lantern show and looked for the regalia and children from
 the dunbow northern lights eaton s catalogue was indian school in their uniforms a book we all enjoyed i remember
 men returning from the the mounted police were dressed in klondike during the gold rush most scarlet tunics black riding
 breeches vivid in my mind were the old chum with gold braid on the leg seam and tobacco bags in
 which they carried gold high riding boots some wore white helnuggets i can still see the nugget watch mets others
 the little pill box hats they chains and nugget tie pins that some were followed by the city police father
 of them wore lacombe father doucet and bishop pinkham were in horse drawn carriages my grandfather died in 1899 and
 was we also saw the mayor and councillors buried in st albert grandmother de a hudson s bay float with
 pelts hanging cided in 1901 that she would go back from a railing and many other sights east where her
 daughters lived and she i enjoyed that parade more than any i asked me to go with her she painted
 a have seen since when we arrived in lovely picture of a convent education wetaskiwin all was changed there too
 the town i had so often seen in my dreams had given way to what was now termed a city
 though a small city i will admit it was wonderful seeing mother dad and the family again we had a
 happy time of it but i half wished i hadn t come home i had one more year to f
 inish at school and i dreaded the day i would have to leave however when the time came i went
 back east and graduated in june 1909 returning to wetaskiwin in september when i was seventeen after the excitement of
 the first weeks of my home coming i found it hard to readjust myself to the ways of the west
 having lived in the east in my most impressionable years i had grown to love the country its ways formalities
 and all history was always most interesting to me and the east had so much of it i was discussing
 the subject with dad one day while the two of us were driving in the country dad who like me
 was somewhat emotional said i understand your mother and i have felt the same but if it is history you
 want there is plenty of it here if bishop de laval was the first a pioneer couple from wetaskiwin were
 mr and mrs l t miquelon the author s parents they arrived at the settlement in 1892 where mr miquelon
 opened a butcher shop at lower right is their eldest son rosarlo had resigned his position and had gone into
 the real estate business with his uncle c w carroll who also hailed from iowa there was no talk of
 oil in those days leduc was just a small town named by w c van home president of the c
 pr after the oblate missionary father leduc the leduc distr ct even then had acquired a reputation for the fertility
 ci its soil and the progressiveness of its settlers bishop of canada bishop grandin was the first bishop of st
 albert if battles were fought and peace declared on the plains of abraham what about our peace hills if jesuits
 were martyred by the indians they tried to christianize what of the oblate fathers i saw lying dead at frog
 lake and rev george mcdougall who was found frozen to death while working among the indians at morley if louis
 hebert was the first farmer in canada i myself was one of the first in the west madame de champlain
 was one of the first white women in quebec city your mother and mine were among the first white women
 in with me it was a case of love at first sight by christmas we were engaged and in april
 1912 we were married shortly after our marriage a quarter section of homestead land was opened for filing about fifteen
 miles south west of leduc my husband asked me what i thought of him trying to file on it would
 i mind living on the place for six months in every year for three years i agreed so he spent
 the night before the land was to be filed on outside of the government office in edmonton he was the
 first at the door the first to file wetaskiwin i hadn t thought of it in that light it is
 funny how other folks history seems more interesting than our own in september 1911 i met a man at the
 leduc fair who was to become my husband he had come there in 1910 on his vacation from davenport iowa
 he had liked the country so well that he on the place and got the homestead band admit that there
 is beauty in a rights rockery as there was a lot of wild land and open range in the district
 we de the land was half a mile from the cided to raise cattle this was a most nearest neighbors
 and the post office successful venture we were granted our there was a fairly large log cabin and patent in
 1916 sold the place and pura barn on the place and all that was chased some of the land on
 the edmonrequired to get the title to the land was ton highway three miles south of leduc to clear break
 and seed thirty acres and live there six months of each year for back in leduc my husband opened three
 years the buildings had been put his own office conveyancing insurance up by a previous homesteader who for and the
 telephone agency in 1916 the some reason or other had failed to corn potato crop failed in the united states
 ply with all the regulations and had and as there was a very heavy potato not been awarded the title
 crop in leduc that year we bought potatoes icr the u s markets competition the first summer we decided to
 go was great as buyers came from the city out on a two weeks vacation we and it was a
 lively market the price brought out supplies and landed there rose to 1 75 a bushel it got to the
 point on a sunday afternoon my husband s where if someone owed a person 50 brother who was with us
 unlocked the or 1 00 the saying was i ll give you door and went in he came out saying
 a spud one day i was on my way to to my husband you can t take the girls a
 tea and my husband was in calgary in there the place is alive with snakes on business as i neared
 his office one my youngest sister who was twelve of the men employed there came to meet years old was
 with us the cabin had me and said mr molyneaux didn t cxbeen empty for some years and the pect
 any more potatoes to be brought snakes had nested under the floor in this week but there are a few
 loads in and i don t like to take the respon there was no arguing we didn t even sibility
 of buying them i said i ll stop for a picnic lunch we drove back look at them to leduc
 and were there in time for supper we have often laughed about it i was wearing a very smart black
 since but ihere was no laughing then suit and spotless white kid gloves i wy husbund was from iowa where
 pulled my gloves off climbed up the snakes are snakesl wagon wheel and reached here and there down into the
 potatoes for a sam sonic months later my husband and ple which i cut into with a pen knife to
 my brother went out to the farm they assure myself that they were not frozen put in a new ceiling
 a new floor plast then i told the driver i would buy them ered the interior calcimined the walls one
 of the merchants across the street an olive green the ceiling cream paint from us told me afterward that an
 eded the woodwork ivory laid linoleum on monton buyer had noticed me and had the part used as a kitchen
 covered the called to him to come out and see who rest of the floor with carpet built on a
 the girl was who was up in the potato screened porch and the place was made wagon he had answered
 him that s quite inviting mike molyneaux s wife and if those po we spent the following summer there tatoes
 are any good you can be damn and enjoyed it on saturday nights sure you won t get them throe
 or four of the neighboring fam leduc in those days was termed ihies would come to play cards we were
 muddy leduc but little did we know too far from church to attend services that black gold lay under that
 thar so we played far into the night i would mud if we had we would have held serve a
 lunch fresh buns home baked onto a c p r quarter with oil and mmbeans cold ham and wild strawberries
 eral rights which now boasts four oil nearly as large as the market size wells we soon found out why
 this home in 1916 there was a provincial elecstead had been abandoned it was stony tion and the main planks
 in the platform and to this day you can t make my hus were women s franchise and the dower
 act the liberal candidate was s g tobin a friend of ours and all the liberal women in town got
 busy to elect him we held a meeting were initiated in the art of electioneering and were told what to
 say women were chosen to speak at the various meetings being bilingual i was asked to speak at beaumont a
 french settlement near leduc i studied my story learned it well translated it into french and i was ready an
 edmonton lawyer mr madore was also to speak for a liberal party i was invited to be the first speaker
 i had learned my story so well covered every point so thoroughly that when it came time for mr madore
 to speak he had to begin nearly every statement with as madame molyneaux has just told you the speaker for
 the conservative party mr giroux another edmonton lawyer was late in arriving he tried to address the meeting but couldn
 t get a hearing honors were bestowed upon bishop c w pinkham by the blood indians when they made him
 an honorary chief in 1926 he was given the name nato wapiyo kow or holy rest election day came and
 i went to beaumont with a friend as an election worker there were just a few cars in the district
 at the time my husband had taken hi s aunt and the doctor s wife to millet in his car
 where they had been assigned the young frenchman who was to accompany us had no car and we had to
 travel by horse and buggy my friend and i went from house to house in beaumont urging the women to
 exercise their franchise we offered to care for their children while they went to vote when the poles closed we
 were tired out and we had eight miles to drive to get home the day was hot and the road
 dusty we had won at beaumont but had no news of the other polls we were driving into leduc looking
 very dejected when my husband and his party met us they were laughing and said for pete s sake cheer
 up tobin is elected i enjoyed informing dad that i was the first woman to address a liberal meeting in
 beaumont the livestock business was good prices climbing so we went into that business too leduc men in business always
 had to compete with edmonton firms and here again the opposition was strong my husband had always considered the farmers
 in all his dealings he had crganized one of the most successful u f a locals in alberta and the
 farmers appreciated his efforts on their behalf so they patronized us my job was to go to the stockyards on
 market days and make out the cheques one day when my husband was in the city i bought a carload
 of hogs and cleared 50 i was quite proud ci myself in 1917 my husband came to his job in
 calgary he was superintendent of the organization department united grain growers ltd and retired in 1954 after 37 years of
 service the telephone department asked me to stay on in wetaskiwin as manager of the telephone office for a year
 at least they bought the house we were living in added a kitchen and used the large living room as
 an office they paid me well furnished living quarters and i had a staff of two shortly before my year
 was up there was a knock at the office door late in the night my room was just over the
 office so i called from the window to inquire what was wanted it was very dark and i heard a
 man s voice saying open district under his administration the the door i want to put through a long collection
 amounting to 17 05 was distance call i informed him that the made up as follows office closed at midnight
 and told him 5 mink skins 50 2 50 to go to the booth at the hotel and the operator

 of the indian chiefs in the huge and the simple faith of a child in the beginning by william hardy
 alexander it is not always easy to find a title for an article nor is the one finally selected necessarily
 a very successful choice you will find the one chosen for this paper was selected a long time ago by
 the author of the book of genesisyou will not have to read very far into that volume to discover that
 and you can stop reading right away if you wish by simply taking my word for it and it is
 also a fact that the evangel of st john starts out in the same way thus i begin or hcpe
 that i shall begin in the odor of sanctity what follows we have heard a good deal here these as
 he has told me make that claim days about our local beginnings there in public wishing to deal with facts
 was a jubilee of the province of alberta and not with just claims he checked my in 1955 when we
 brought to memory the statement by referring to the early mmbeginning of a seriously shaped form of utes of the
 senate which then dealt with democratic government for what had such matters and fcund that historically previously been only a
 territorial make i was correct the annual statement of shift and in 1967 there will be a cele the classical
 association of canada for bration here and elsewhere in canada s 1958 calls me w i alexander that is confederation
 all the way from sir john entirely wrong i was not even related macdonald of ontario to joey small to
 him except as his pupil in english wood of newfoundland in 1958 there i for 1895 1896 please understand that
 was celebrated a jubilee of the univer i take no offence at being called w j sity of alberta and
 the phrase in the it is just wrong not a fact and so not beginning was often heard in the
 in history evitable speeches and even yet more often felt no doubt it is about this latter professor e k
 broadus might just as event the origins of the university of well have been the first nominee to the alberta
 that i want to say a few words staff the point of historical value would by way of postoript to
 that celebration have been precisely the same namely that a teacher of language was or what i shall say will
 be only about would have been the first appointment the beginning of the university of alberta as it was known
 to me specifically historically in the beginning president tory recognized the fact in which and personally and that fact will
 be my he himself has been brought up that only justification for saying it there the first item for a
 university s founders are a good many things about that to take into account was letters not beginning which i
 do not know and shall never i hope pretend that i do everybody then thought so and far thus falling
 into a common error of fewer i fear hold by that belief today it was said in edmonton at the
 timepeople and communities who are concerned about their beginnings to the but this is just gossip and i cannot point
 of guesswork too often later qualify it as historical that frank oliver said appropos of dr tory s first known
 as history i am going to mention only a few items for which i can vouch appointments that man tory
 must be on a personal basis crazy we don t need any college here at all if we did it
 would be to turn out it is historically true that i was the horse doctors yet i observed recently first
 professor appointed to the staff of in the press that our present government the university of alberta dr scarlett ruling
 fifty two years later differ in our valued chancellor immediately pre that as in some other things from ceding chancellor
 cairs once heard me frank meantime quite a number of al dr alexander was professor of classics at the university
 ot alberta from 1908 to 1938 this paper was given at the society s edmonton meeting in october 1959 bertans
 have heard about shakespeare now i shall provide a piece of hisand john milton and even about julius tory i
 can call it that because it was caesar and cicero and there is much given me by howard mclean who
 sixty less need for horses in 400 000 motor years ago was a classmate of mine at rich alberta than
 in honest frank s day toronto he was practising law in calgary and also strongly abetting the it is said
 and i believe that con liberal party there he told me that firmation can be found for the statement after
 the capital had been awarded historically in the senate s minute book to edmonton gloom reigned in the lib that
 it was moved by someone present eral ranks of the southern city but he that no member of the new
 faculty be ber of the liberal executive as a mem appointed from outside the province pointed out to the leaders
 of their organan eminent member of the calgary legal izaticn that there still remained a great group was of the
 opinion per contra gift for the government of alberta to that no nomination of any person then bestow in the
 form namely of a proresiding in alberta should be consid vinoial university and proposed that ered they send a delegation
 north to press why did the university of alberta in calgary s claims on the cabinet his the appointment it
 made call three pro proposal was hooted down unanifessors of the languages and only one mously what was the good
 of a uni practical man profensor muir ed versity anyway calgary has unwards i do not profess to know the
 doubtedly had other thoughts since that exact reason but i think that dr ruth time but you can perhaps understand
 erford a graduate of mcgill university their disbelief at the time of any good and dr tory of the same
 description coming out of nazareth probably found themselves in genuine accord as to the best manner in which to an
 early aerial view of the university of get a university underway it would alberta campus shows wide expanses of open
 be less easy to justify such a policy now space the arts building is at the extreme left it is
 my belief that conditions justified it with the residence s behind it at centre is then despite mr oliver s
 cutting re st stephen s and the medical building while at mark extreme left is the university hospital dr rutherford
 was anxious obvi my final year there 1894 1895 and the ously to have the university of the prov man
 who gave quite a few of us musimoe in his own constituency hence the cal experience in the glee club
 which acquisition of river lot no 5 crowded he introduced since those days until into the se corner where the
 huge ac september 1908 i had never laid eyes on cumulation of university buildings him and lo here he was
 after thirteen stands today 1960 it was a pretty un years but it was for him and his wife promising
 stretch of land no one then a tactical error to have come neither of dreamed that by 1960 we should
 all be them could take it and after one year sorry to have omitted to secure windsor they went east
 again to new york city park as well there was nothing what even then our students were keen wits ever
 on the adjacent subdivision of their farewell gift was a coyote skin rug strathcona the garneau in those days that
 was irony indeed he was suc my young wife and i picked our way ceeded by dr william alexander robb
 daintily among the bushes and tall kerr who became dean of the arts grass while i banged a golfball around
 faculty in 1914 and the university s third oblivious of any possibility of damage president 1936 1941 brave days indeed
 there was no such possibility as those a couple of years ago i presented a matter of fact an indian
 school to the university library the first four seemed a more likely construction to be calendars of the institution they
 also placed on river lot 5 than a university contain the university examinations of building that age and i must
 say i still admire their quality i would almost shrink it is an historical fact about which from qualifying by
 them there should never be any forgetfulness or misunderstanding that dr a c in that first year of classes 1908
 rutherford was one of edmonton strath 1909 the wise faculty rather against cona s greatest benefactors the direc dr tory
 s judgment decided that the tion of that benefaction lay in 1 the college year should consist of two terms

 of uary 20 th and january 25 th to end of henry marshall tory as first president may this was
 the american plan a to give the scheme life and shape it two term year and we of the faculty
 was much held against them and con had all been laboring recently in the sequently against their educational american vineyard
 though only profledgling that they were both mcgill fessor broadus was an american born men what of that mcgill is
 and al it was a failure why a usual way of ways has been in the very forefront of eastern

 usual and the same relief only was open to the americans appreciated him and his them summer teaching but because
 of jests long before his fellow nationals our double term running on to the end did of may the appointments
 had all been made when our amateurs sallied out to now i return to very plain history offer to peddle
 knowledge on the coun the third appointee to the university of tryside so that was the only double alberta staff
 was dr luther h alex term in university of alberta history ander as professor of french and german the similarity
 of his name with our first classes apparently took my own gave rise to many confusions place in the nearest
 place we could get then and thereafter and no one in to heaven viz the top floor of the queen
 strathcona was more astounded than i alexandra school we moved to the the morning that i met my colleague to
 strathoona collegiate institute in janube for the next year i recognized him ary 1909 and remained there till june at
 once as my teacher at the ottawa 1911 i want to pay my tribute and this collegiate institute now lisgar
 ci in is no historic fiction either to 1 the excellence of the building the techni hish 51 probably the
 best achievement cal skill that went into that structure of my life graduates used to say that and carried us
 and our scholars and the those who had completed their college combined learning of the two groups days at alberta
 up to may 1938 could solidly on its upper floors some hard be divided into two classes those who judges
 may say that that was no great had taken classics 51 and those who weight a matter of opinion of
 course had not and that has often though not historical made history 2 the outstanding janitor now let us return
 to a few facts in service given us by jim martin who had the beginning in the early fall of
 1908 no foolish new world or new age no president tory in the interval of some tions of the superiority
 of pupils over more practical consideratioi is called teachers or students over professors me in for one of his famous
 two minute very little recognition was given either interviews he said look up for us the building or jim when
 it was finally some day will you a motto oh yes in surrendered as a school in 1958 i give
 latin surely for the university i tell that recognition gratefully now we of this with a personal concern because the
 university surrendered our lease the choice was credited to him last year however in june 1911 and took up new
 in a display in the rutherford library quarters on the university grounds portico this is an historic error but he
 river lot 5 in the building called chose the chooser i came upon in st athabasca this building long served
 aul s epistle to ih e philippians these noble generations of alberta young men with words as they stand in
 the latin vulgate both classrooms and sleeping accommo version dc cetero r atres quaecumque dation and the professors with strange
 sun i vera quaecumnque pudica quaecumque offices such as the bathroom with the iusla quaecumnque sancia quaecuinque amasloping floors which
 dr kerr and i used bum quaecurnque bona jamae si qua virtus as our office for a couple of years
 our si qua laus itoec cogitate there are sevslants were different eral phrases there that would serve for a good
 university motto i offered this by 1913 our graduates were going choice of mine to president tory quaeout into the
 world for graduate studies cumque vera i did not then know that it and we who had had the undergradu
 had already been chosen by northwestate training of them were rejoiced to em university of evanston illinois hear good reports
 of them in the van they probably don t know yet about ous phases they had sought out this the
 university of alberta capital he has continued to be the case and one said capital is that in the bible
 by may almost boast of their achievements the way alexander i don t remember at home and abroad it so
 it was accepted by him and recommended to the senate who were of in the fall of 1915 despite the
 black accord i might add that i showed it to cloud of world war i hanging over us the padre
 who was the parish priest of and casualty lists revealing gaps in our st anthony s in those days and
 he was ranks already we took possession of much pleased with the selection and with that noble building over which
 my heart the fact that it is in latin still swells with pride the arts and sciences building facing east
 down 91 st and now i turn back to admit to a avenue i believe that this is the wrong
 just share in the history of the university facing according to earlier plans how of alberta my wife of fifty
 two years ever there it stands of it professor standing who passed from us on ahead burgess was in his
 judgment and who in april 1956 a little more than three in such a matter shall judge better years since
 early records of the the finest georgian academic building wauneita society will show how she in the whole of canada
 when i came strove mightily to aid mrs tory in getback to edmonton recently after eigh ting that institution on
 its feet there teen years absence i was deeply moved will be some still who can remember to gaze on
 that noble front and think her kindly and gracious and always of happy and i hope useful hours ready by
 hard work or light but pracspent in it developing classics in eng tical suggestion to forward the inter the new
 arts building on the university of alberta campus was a source of pride for the staff and students this photo
 was taken by mc dermid s studio shortly after its completion ests of alberta women whose academic are few now
 but the fact is there and home was the university of alberta i have written on the page of history
 just whose factual achievement some of one day she and i in our first alberta it was october were wandering
 along the south bank of the saskatchewan sud we were only six years young when denly she exclaimed there it
 is i ve the first world war descended on us got it got what said i having no everybody wanted
 to help and the lead to suppose what she had in mind abodes of peace turned into the exer the
 colors she said i was discuss cise grounds of arms rifles to meet the ing only yesterday with some of
 the demands of the official training manual girls what should be the alberta colors were inadequate to serve us all
 finally don t you see them why the whole a clever carpenter of the work staff view cries out green
 and gold sawed out for the faculty platoon the semblance of rifles all in wood stu and of course it
 did there was the dents lined the walks to watch their green of the basic dark evergreen trees instructors mangle
 the precise instrucand the all golden foliage of the poplar tions of the manual and shook their wise leafage running
 through them in richest heads finally an old country man contrast and that s where all that came among them
 ended the embarrassment from and i think we can all agree that by saying quite audibly for both specit was
 a divinely prompted suggestion tators and the faculty platoon to hear students both men and women ap my god won
 t the kaiser shiver when proved and a committee was appointed he gets his first news of them preparwith the
 consent of dr and mrs tory ing for the fray history records us to visit johnstone walker s store and
 see a laugh for that day and yet another to what extent those marvellous tints when under dr killam the
 faculty plaof nature could be reproduced in wool toon was carrying through the manual it was not altogether easy especially
 of arms in convocation hall it was in this remote backwater of empire as pretty cold in the hall as
 coal was being is was in 1908 but in the end little by economized and soon one heard the little
 all difficulties were overcome and voice of the president private piping incompatibilities eliminated all this is out lieutenant killam will
 you please history the witnesses of its beginning shut that door these then are some few facts about of 1919
 and more definitely in the next the first six years in the beginning college year the university s teachers of
 the university of alberta here as everywhere had to recognize for a fact that the boys who had left us
 man power for the armed services to participate in war came back if was running down numerically as the they
 came back men every teacher first great war dragged its slow course worth his salt had to readjust his inalong
 the fact of how that came to be struction to this situation these men and what that fact meant exactly
 to us before you had readily enough accepted is written in those amazing lists that your ipse clixit on life
 and its evolution consume so much wall space around and its meaning two three four years convocation hall telling so
 often of the ago having looked into the eyes of supreme sacrifice women began to form death they had caught
 up with you in a larger proportion of the student body the race of life or even passed you i
 and finally the inevitable gained recog testify to the fact for myself that it was nition in 1917 1918 if
 my memory not easy the task that thus laid upon serves me the university of alberta me but out of
 such facts of an unusual undergraduates chose as the president experience the next epoch in the history of their society

 the government i think that we met it in the best sense of affairs by women has greatly pro in
 the classrooms and the laboratories gressed since those days forty years here in any event old things were back among
 us here it was well started passed away and it is my conviction by the university of alberta undergrau that
 the facts of the great war 1914 ate society s sole women president i 1918 and of the great interlude
 1919 have been told that she attained her 1939 thereafter with the second great position only by formal succession to
 war 1939 1945 have continued to prothe office nonetheless she measured vide the university with an honorable up to it

 fessional chairs and in student benches the boasting that might seem so natural nonetheless may that evolution always over an
