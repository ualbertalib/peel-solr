 the patrician 5 a brief history of work point barracks by major rb mainprize cd garrison adjutant hq esquimalt garrison 
 overlooking west bay on victoria harbour in esquimalt 8 c is work point barracks the home of canada s most 
 westerly army garrison built in 1887 it is presently garrisoned by the first battalion princess patricia s canadian light infantry 
 under the command of lieutenant colonel g g brown cd the history of this west coast camp dates back to 
 1878 seven years after british columbia joined the confederation of canada and nine years before the construction of work point 
 barracks began after the russo turkish war great britain and russia remained on uneasy terms as a result of british 
 policy during the hostilities the threat of open conflict was feared both in london and ottawa in february 1878 the 
 presence of a russian squadron of eleven ships in the san francisco harbour did little to dispel this fear to 
 the people of british columbia the defencelessness of their position was uncomfortably realized major general e selby smyth commander of 
 militia at that time urged the handing over of a number of 7 inch guns to the militia from the 
 royal navy base in esquimalt these guns which were being returned to england could be used for shore batteries as 
 a show of force against any russian threat he contended finally on may 11 1878 lieutenant colonel d c t 
 irwin inspector of artillery was ordered to supervise the construction of coastal batteries in the victoria esquimalt area one battery 
 of three 7 inch 6v2 ton rifled muzzle loading guns was established at macaulay point two other batteries were authorized 
 for finlayson point and brothers island manned by volunteers mostly retired royal marines who were familiar with the naval pieces 
 the macaulay battery was authorized and named the victoria battery of garrison artillery the militia general order no 17 dated 
 19 july 1878 and published in the canada gazette on 20 july 1878 reads as follows the formation of a 
 battery of garrison artillery at victoria is hereby authorized to be designated the victoria battery of garrison artillery thus this 
 terse military order heralded the birth of the esquimalt army garrison it is interesting to note that the first public 
 mention of the battery s activity was recorded in the victoria colonist on the morning of july 27 1878 which 
 is quoted in part yesterday at 5 p m the first gun was fired from the battery on monday a 
 salute of 13 guns will be fired by the victoria garrison artillery by 1883 the macaulay point battery became part 
 of the b c provisional regiment of garrison artillery forerunner to the present day sth bc independent 0:inde 0:pendent medium

 the patrician 6 it wasn t until 1887 however that work point was officially chosen as the site for military 
 barracks while on a tour of inspection in british columbia the minister of militia sir a p c caron made 
 the selection for construction of a permanent military base the close proximity to the macaulay defences probably helped to influence 
 this choice long before confederation when vancouver island was a crown colony work point had been named for the honourable 
 john work by officers of the hudson s bay company this name was adopted by captain henry kellett of the 
 hms herald on the first survey of victoria harbour in 1846 john work was an early pioneer and chief factor 
 with the hudson s bay company before he retired to victoria in 1841 in 1853 he was made a member 
 of the legislative council of the crown colony of vancouver island he died in december 1861 at the age of 
 70 commanded by major james peters c battery of the royal canadian artillery consisting of 100 ncos and gunners arrived 
 from quebec on november 11 1887 their arrival marked the first time a unit of regular troops had crossed the 
 continent over the recently constructed canadian pacific railway line the battery was temporarily quartered in an old agricultural building near 
 beacon hill in victoria where it remained until construction at work point was completed as part of the recreational training 
 program of that era officers non commissioned 0:non 0:com 0:missioned officers and gunners of the battery were put to the 
 tedious task of clearing the primeval forest at work point before any buildings could be erected by the spring of 
 1888 construction had started the colonist in june 1888 had this to say about the project work at the barracks 
 is proceeding with commendable rapidity the three buildings are all closed in and the roofs shingled between the double weather 
 boarding felt paper has been introduced so as to add to the warmth of the rooms the buildings rest on 
 stone foundations by 1891 the camp was completed and c battery became its first inhabitants they remained until the autumn 
 of 1893 when they returned east during the six year period many members of the garrison left the army and 
 embarked upon civilian careers throughout the province the battery strength had fallen to fiftythree 0:fifty 0:three all ranks on march 
 30 1894 a detachment of royal marine artillery with a complement 0:comple 0:ment of three officers and seventy five other 
 ranks arrived from england under the command of lieutenant colonel g a l rawthorne they were to replace the departed 
 c battery and like their predecessors were destined to serve six years at the work point garrison in may of 
 the same year twenty sappers from the 18th fortress company royal engineers arrived from halifax their job was to demolish 
 old earth and wood batteries and to lay out and direct the building of new concrete and earth forts the 
 royal marine artillery ended their stay in september 1899 and were replaced by another british artillery unit the 19th company 
 western division royal garrison artillery in the following june the 48th company submarine miners royal engineers arrived from england along 
 with half of the 44th fortress company royal engineers 
 the patrician 7 entrance to work point barracks circa 1900 after a short two year tour of duty the 19th 
 company rga sailed for hong kong the 21st company royal garrison artillery reached esquimalt from bermuda to assume the garrison 
 duties this company later became known as the 83rd company in december 1903 they too sailed for hong kong and 
 were replaced by the 58th company from halifax during the early years work point was garrisoned mostly by british due 
 in part to the poor discipline and training of the canadian volunteers desertions were frequent caused primarily by low pay 
 civilians including chinese coolies and indians were receiving higher remuneration and the lure of civilian wages was too much for 
 many of the gunners it was also during this period that the dominion and imperial governments found trouble agreeing on 
 the feasibility and cost sharing of the esquimalt defences canada wanted britain to bear the cost of maintaining the british 
 troops while britain felt that part of the upkeep should be borne by canada after a great deal of correspondence 
 between ottawa and london canada finally agreed on july 1 1905 to take over all the west coast defences thereby 
 relieving the imperial units of their canadian commitment in 1906 350 officers and men of the imperial garrison departed for 
 england royal artillery and royal engineers accompanied by small detachments of royal army service corps royal army medical corps army 
 ordnance and army pay corps bade farewell to victoria to replace the departing british soldiers came a garrison company of 
 royal canadian artillery a fortress company of royal canadian engineers and the royal school of instruction these troops represented the 
 first canadian regular forces in the garrison since c battery rca departed in 1893 the next few years saw virtually 
 no change in the complement of troops at the garrison in 1911 the headquarters of military district no 11 was 
 established at work point but it wasn t until the outbreak of world war i in 1914 that the number 
 of soldiers increased to any extent

 in 1914 this was a royal school training company and trained re inforcements in lsquimalt until 1917 victoria s sth

 it moved into work point barracks manned tne macaulay defences and other local forts and trained numerous drafts of re 
 inforcements for overseas service the sth continued in this role until 1919 when it once again returned to militia status 
 following world war i canada maintained a very small permanent force this force included the royal canadian dragoons lord strathcona 
 s horse royal canadians royal canadian horse artillery coastal batteries of royal canadian artillery at halifax and victoria royal canadian 
 engineers royal canadian corps of signals and three infantry regiments which included the royal canadian regiment princess patricia s canadian 
 light infantry and the royal 22e regiment small detachments of services were also included as part of the permanent army 
 none of these units numbered anything close to a war or peacetime establishment strength in november 1920 the arrival of 
 b company of the princess patricia s canadian light infantry under the command of brevet lieutenant colonel f h m 
 codville mc marked the first occasion an infantry unit was to garrison work point barracks b company was destined to 
 spend the next nineteen years at the garrison the citizens of victoria adopted the company as their own and many 
 soldiers who later retired from the army became permanent residents of the capital city the years between the wars were 
 a lean period for all military forces in canada and the esquimalt garrison was no exception training was conducted with 
 makeshift 0:make 0:shift equipment and much imagination and initiative was required by all ranks in the performance of their duties 
 the parade ground performance of these troops however was excellent and on numerous occasions the ppcli company was called upon 
 to supply guards of honour for visiting dignitaries and to perform other ceremonial parades by 1939 war clouds had once 
 again darkened the european scene and nazi germany began its quest for world domination on the first of september war 
 was declared and the ppcli was immediately mobilized for overseas service shortly after mobilization the ppcli detachment at work point 
 was increased to two rifle companies plus portions of bhq hq and support companies on the 14th of november 1939 
 they departed from victoria to join the remainder of the battalion at winnipeg during the period between the wars elements 
 of both the royal canadian artillery and the royal canadian engineers were part of the esquimalt garrison work point from 
 1939 to 1945 was garrisoned by anti aircraft batteries and served also as a training centre for overseas troops of

 1940 this unit was despatched to eastern canada for overseas embarkation military district no 11 maintained its headquarters at the

 of the royal canadian artillery and royal canadian engineers the royal canadian school of artillery coastal and anti aircraft formed 
 part of the garrison from 1946 to 1953 it was during this period in 1949 that the artillery defences at 
 macaulay point were removed leaving only the old gun emplacements as a reminder of local military history in 1953 the 
 school of artillery left work point for camp shilo manitoba where it is stationed today until 1955 three batteries of 
 heavy anti aircraft artillery were part of the garrison they were the 119 battery 127 battery and 129 battery only 
 the 119 th was stationed at work point while the other two maintained albert head mary hill and gordon head 
 camps the 119 th and 127 th batteries departed in 1955 and the remaining 129 battery was re organized as 
 the 4th light anti aircraft battery rca and stationed at work point it was also during this year that the 
 3rd field squadron rce arrived from germany after completing a two year tour of duty with canada s nato force 
 although the military camps at albert head mary hill and gordon head were occupied by troops at this time they 
 were nevertheless considered part of the esquimalt garrison from 1955 to 1957 one of canada s oldest infantry units the

 departure of the 4th laa battery gordon head camp was closed down and is now the new campus for victoria 
 college while mary hill and albert head camps were vacated to become training camps when required the exodus of the 
 artillery and engineers signalled the end of a garrison that had been built primarily as a coastal defence measure in 
 november 1957 after completing a nato tour of duty in europe the ist battalion princess patricia s canadian light infantry 
 under the command of lieutenant colonel t defaye mbe cd arrived to take over garrison duties at work point this 
 return to work point by the ppcli was likened to a homecoming by some of the older members of the 
 regiment many of the retired veterans in victoria who had begun their military careers with pre war b company welcomed 
 0:wel 0:comed the battalion with open arms the garrison is still manned today by the ist battalion ppcli but the 
 canadian army commitment to nato will mean another change of troops in the near future over the years the face

 the patrician 15 mpanyinfo atirirwfo a euro 1962 by captain gd hunt cmtt ghana this second year of existence for 
 the canadian armed forces training team in ghana has seen an almost complete turnover of patricia officers colonel vr schjelderup 
 the commanding officer is our only veteran as major frost and captain goodman have returned to canada while captains dallison 
 hunt munro and robison have arrived as re inforcements at one time when all seven of the above were here 
 together the ghanaians thought that the ppcli was the canadian army perhaps they were not so wrong at that from 
 talking to other officers in canada it would appear that there is a general misconception as to our role here 
 we have not come to be pukka sahibs which was the prevailing impression nor are we here as the british 
 were previously that is to run the army we are strictly teachers and advisers with no real powers of command 
 and no operational commitments all the patricia officers excepting of course colonel schjelderup are employed at mats the military academy 
 and training school which is located six miles east of accra captains dallison hunt and robison are platoon commanders 0:com 
 0:manders at the military academy and captain munro is weapons officer at the infantry wing of the training school one 
 can most easily picture this establishment 0:establish 0:ment as being similar to the rcs of i and consisting of the 
 academy infantry clerical pt education and administrative wings since the majority of us are at the academy it will be 
 described first the present cadets are taking a two year course of mixed military and academic subjects although previous cadets 
 graduated after one year of training or even less the military portion which is almost entirely in our hands is 
 nearly identical with what is taught in ocp rotp or cotc in canada excepting of course that the emphasis is 
 on different subjects here jungle operations being the prime example the academic training is on the level of the senior 
 matriculation year in canadian schools most of the cadets come from southern ghana where one has a better opportunity 0:oppor 
 0:tunity to acquire education as opposed to the warrior tribes of the north who provide most of the ncos and 
 men for the army pronunciation of names was a bit of a problem for us at first try this for 
 example kyeremateng pronounced 0:pro 0:nounced chair ma ting this worked both ways for a long time all messages 0:mes 0:sages 
 were delivered to capt hunt regardless of whom they were for as the ghanians couldn t pronounce any one else 
 s name the cadets all have the equivalent to junior matriculation on entry but it is always necessary to remember 
 the gaps in their experience ie none of them have ever seen a tank outside of the cinema their knowledge 
 of simple machines and basic science is limited etc this occasionally 0:occasion 0:ally leads to the sort of situation where 
 one speaks for ten minutes encouraged by the attentive looks of the class and then suddenly realizes that no one 
 has the faintest idea of what you are saying but doesn t like to disappoint you by saying so while 
 the majority of the cadets have no military experience we do have some ex ors and about fifty cadets who 
 trained for a year in the lenin military academy tashkent they will i suppose be one of the very few 
 groups of officers in any army who have been trained on both sides of the fence 
 the patrician 16 capt gd hunt with officers and cadets at a mess dinner ghana military academy field training is 
 rather more fun in ghana than at home one seldom passes through a village where there is not at least 
 one old soldier who wants to come and talk to you about burma or east africa or perhaps would like 
 to offer you a drink of palm wine freshly brewed or a local drink known as kill me quick moderation 
 is a good policy if you want to stay on your feet you may have read in the first report 
 that canadians are teaching jungle warfare and have wondered if this wasn t a case of the blind leading the 
 blind we think not and are sure the results of the training wiil bear us out we are now in 
 the process of planning a large jung e anti terrorist exercise for the cadets we will fly them to an 
 area about one hundred and fifty miles to the north and try to search for and destroy a terrorist group 
 the instructors feel that they will learn at least as much as the cadets from this for while this is 
 routine for some armies it is certainly different and challenging for canadians the cadets have a rugger team which plays 
 in the local league and certainly nowhere in the world is the game played on a harder field the local 
 ground is called laterite and is a type of tough shale it is very different from the soft green sward 
 of victoria generally speaking all the sports popular with the cadets such as field hockey and soccer are not ones 
 to which we are accustomed and it was a pleasure to find common ground in rugger the academy and officers 
 generally enjoy a high standing in ghana the president attended the graduation parade last september which would appear to emphasize 
 his interest in the armed forces the canadian instructors were presented 0:pre 0:sented to him at this time and were 
 told how much their efforts were appreciated 
 the patrician 17 now a few words about the infantry wing it functions in a similar manner to the rcs 
 of i in holding company and platoon commanders courses junior and senior nco courses and weapons courses lt also carries 
 out trials on various new equipment the wing operates on an establishment of four officers two of whom are canadians 
 and about a dozen ors as far as the rest of us are concerned 0:con 0:cerned the wing s chief 
 claim to fame is its ability to select sites for tewts which are almost but unfortunately not quite inaccessible jungle 
 most of us have seen some of the country even if only through tewts and exercises and some have made 
 considerable journeys up country as far as accra goes it is a city much like any other but once one 
 leaves accra there are many places and things of great interest and others which are totally outside any of our 
 previous experience an article is forth coming from capt dallison on the subject of his trip to the north most 
 of us went on a sort of picnic tour to akosombo 0:ako 0:sombo to see the volta dam project a 
 site the importance of which current affairs exam writers of the last few years will be well aware and also 
 to a mission school near by where the fathers keep a menagerie including many snakes some including wives and children 
 will now at the drop of a hat show you pictures slides or movies wherein the principal character has a 
 snake curled around some part of their anatomy of course these are really wait until we get back to canada 
 pictures the social round is quite active both with mess and with peculiarly if that s the correct word canadian 
 affairs the colonel is a frequent host and most of the others entertain a lot all this helps in getting 
 to know our ghanian friends and is part of our job as canadians abroad we plan a new year s 
 eve party at the mats pool which may mean more replacements will soon be required ps no they won t 
 be on the whole our impressions of ghana are happy ones we do find the climate a bit enervating at 
 times and a tendency to decide manana will be soon enough for some problems but there is a certain satisfaction

 the patrician 19 rn hob tracked personnel carrier and rnt 75 trailer the robin nodwell tracked personnel and equipment carrier 
 a new advance in over snow equipment by capt fl berry transport officer 2 ppcli the canadian army recently acquired 
 three rn 110 b tracked personnel carriers and one rnt is trailer which were turned over to 2 ppcli for 
 testing under actual operational conditions second battalion carried out this task during exercise snow chinthe 111 conducted at camp wainwright 
 by using them as mobile command posts and for the oversnow lifting of heavy supplies the machine as indicated by 
 its name is a brain child of a canadian designer who also supervised their manufacture in a small plant located 
 in calgary large wide tracks have been employed by the designer to distribute the weight of the vehicle in such 
 a manner as to have a low pounds per square inch weight over the bearing surface this feature makes the 
 carrier particularly suitable for oversnow movement or operations in the muskeg areas of the canadian north in fact the nodwell 
 carriers were originally employed by the petroleum industry in their northern oil explorations the vehicle has proven to be quite 
 successful 
 the patrician 20 in moving heavy oil rigs and equipment over varying terrain in both summer and winter during snow 
 chinthe 111 the nodwells were tested in both cross country and road movement over ground conditions which varied from soft 
 snow to hard packed snow or ice unfortunately the snow was not deep enough to hinder the movement of these 
 vehicles and therefore this phase of the trial was not considered to have been completed to the point where it 
 could be declared successful or otherwise the general opinion of those who used the nodwells during the exercise was that 
 they were a great advance in providing over snow mobility the cargo carrying capacity is rated at five tons with 
 a further five ton load capability provided by the trailer this heavy lift factor makes it possible for a battalion 
 commander to move essential supplies closely behind his forward troops a more practical example of the load carrying capacity of 
 the vehicle is that one nodwell carrier and trailer can lift the rucksacks and toboggans of an infantry company consisting 
 of some one hundred men no difficulties were experienced in instructing drivers to operate the nodwell as all the personnel 
 participating in the test had recently completed a track conversion course at camp sarcee maintenance of the vehicle is a 
 simple task and does not require any specialized tools or skills the track and steering brake adjustment are both well 
 within the capabilities of most infantry drivers unlike many specialized vehicles the spare parts are readily available since the main 
 components are made from a standard commercial pattern studies and tests are still being completed on this vehicle and it 
 is expected that more will be written about it in the future this article has been presented as a sneak

 the period of tenth to fifteenth september 1962 first patricias had the privilege of contributing one officer and forty two 
 other ranks to the canadian contingent which put on the canadian tattoo as part of canada week at the seattle 
 world fair the battalion received word of this coming event early in february later in may the producer captain is 
 fraser rhc visited victoria and notified the battalion they were to be responsible for two sequences in the tattoo the 
 british period sentry mount circa 1855 and the modern sentries following captain fraser s visit the script for the tattoo 
 along with a british drill manual of 1856 were received with interest however little work could be done in preparation 
 for the tattoo as summer concentration was soon at hand during the summer personnel for the british period sentry mount 
 were selected and were measured and fitted for uniforms which were identical to those worn by british garrison troops in 
 canada around 1856 early in august the writer the guard nco csm v o 2 danyleyko and his stand in 
 sergeant t cormier started working on the drill for the british sentry mount on august twentieth the contingent commenced training 
 under csm wo 2 danyleyko and sergeant cormier demonstrations of the drill brought a few chuckles at first but soon 
 everyone was serious and in no time some twenty new drill movements had been mastered those not involved in the 
 british period sentry mount commenced training under sergeant j poucher for their part in the modern sentries instruction on the 
 rifle drill was made more difficult as until the twenty eighth of august the rifles that were to be used 
 had not arrived and the contingent had to make do with a varied assortment borrowed from the militia on the 
 twenty eighth of august twenty one brown bess muskets arrived the following day a dress 
 the patrician 22 csm wo2 danyleyko and his troops vintage 1856 preparing for the seattle world fair rehearsal attended by 
 some two hundred people was held and was televised by the c b c although a british drill manual was 
 at hand it was found that a manual written in french was much easier to understand once translated it is 
 interesting to note that over one hundred years ago the british drill manual had been translated 0:trans 0:lated into french 
 and in 1962 had to be translated back into english historically speaking the brown bess muskets were incorrect british garrison 
 soldiers of 1856 used a muzzle loading flintlock musket dating back to 1738 however by removing the flash pan and 
 adding a sling the muskets were made to look much like snider rifles on saturday the first of september the 
 contingent moved to seattle and settled in to their quarters at pier 91 a naval supply depot near the heart 
 of seattle the next day was free and nearly everyone made a first visit to the world fair and were 
 admitted free of charge as participants during the next two days the contingent practiced with personnel from the second regiment 
 royal canadian horse artillery who were also part of the british period sentry mount it was during this time when 
 all concerned found that timing and positioning were all important in show biz as they were continually checked on this 
 by the producer until both items were perfect wednesday afternoon full rehearsals commenced at the pier 91 sports field no 
 doubt the sound of seven bands massed together caused quite a stir during the first rehearsal however the second regiment 
 royal canadian horse artillery undoubtedly caused the greatest commotion when they fired a blank from their ancient twelve pounder concern 
 was evident amongst the twenty five or more workmen perched high up on the magnolia bridge at which the gun

 clinic located very close by 
 the patrician 23 rehearsals progressed extremely well and on sunday the ninth of september all personnel were transported to the 
 fair grounds for the dress rehearsal bad luck prevailed that night and only the first twenty minutes of the tattoo 
 had been performed when the rains came and the rehearsal had to be cancelled the next day the stadium was 
 a sea of mud and that nights performance had to be cancelled but the world fair executive had seen enough 
 of the tattoo to realize its potential and by tuesday afternoon the stadium had been paved so that the tattoo 
 could go on rain or shine although this paving job cost fifteen thousand dollars it was paid for on opening 
 night as the attendance at the fair jumped by over thirty thousand people tuesday was opening night for the canadian 
 tattoo and was watched by well over fifteen thousand enthusiastic spectators wednesday night in the midst of a heavy rainstorm 
 as many or more jammed the stadium the tattoo was well on its way to being the smash hit of 
 the world fair and more seating was added to the stadium as capacity crowds attended each night and thousands were 
 turned away the tattoo was extended until the evening of sunday the sixteenth of september with a matinee being performed 
 that afternoon for some five hundred underprivileged children no doubt the most thrilling part of the tattoo for the participants 
 was the lengthy standing ovation they received each night just prior to the grand finale when the entire contingent formed 
 up in the stadium full lights were turned on and the voice of the narrator captain rd bell first patricia 
 s boomed out announcing 0:an 0:nouncing ladies and gentlemen the canadian contingent applause such as this received from nearly twenty 
 thousand people each night certainly was a heartwarming 0:heart 0:warming experience for all concerned drill with brown bess muskets converted

 the patrician 26 united states army jungle warfare course by captain rm macintosh 1 ppcli in 1960 in order to 
 train personnel in jungle operations the united states army established a jungle warfare training centre at fort sherman in the 
 canal zone the training centre provides courses for personnel from the three american services including the marines the department of 
 the army also sends selected civilians and courses are provided as well for representatives from central and south american countries 
 the scope of the jungle warfare course includes training in the following subjects escape and evasion jungle firing jungle communications 
 navigation tactical and logistical operations the course consists of fifteen actual working days a minimum of class room instruction is 
 given the emphasis being placed on practical application of lessons taught training is conducted on the basis that the student 
 is versed in normal operations 0:oper 0:ations but has no practical experience in jungle operations the instruction is divided into 
 two major parts one involving the art of jungle living the other jungle warfare the student realizes quickly that to 
 fight in the jungle he must learn to live there not merely survive 
 the patrician 27 what use is this type of training to a canadian soldier the nature of the terrain itself 
 limits the amount of practical training that can be done in canada however lectures can be conducted on many of 
 the subjects and on topics such as communications navigations and ambush adaptations could be made to fit certain areas of 
 the country for example although there is a vast difference between central america and the west coast of british columbia 
 insofar as climate physical relief and wild life there are many similar obstacles encountered as a west coaster who has 
 done a small amount of travelling through the rain forests of vancouver island and the british columbia mainland 1 can 
 say without hesitation 0:hesita 0:tion that cross country movement in the two areas is equally as difficult communications 0:communi 0:cations 
 provide similar problems and one of basic needs of man warmth which is not a problem in the jungle becomes 
 a real challenge to any group of men moving cross country on the west coast and must be considered in 
 the daily plan in retrospect the course provided the basis of training required to conduct jungle operation opened new fields 
 of thought for training and gave an opportunity for an exchange of military ideas with american officers killarney barber shop

 the patrician 28 delia falls concluded lieutenant rm macintosh as related in the 1962 patrician the reconnaissance platoon of the 
 first battalion attempted to journey by land from bedwell sound on the west coast of vancouver island eastward to great 
 central lake in the centre of the island in june of 1961 this trip ended in failure when the platoon 
 was forced to turn back after encountering impassable snow at the 3 200 foot level for those who took part 
 the trip provided an unequalled experience and left with a number the desire to return at a more suitable time 
 and complete the journey in mid august of this year captain pb walsh the battalion medical officer accompanied by lieutenants 
 dj campbell and rm macintosh completed plans for the second trip on a wet and overcast day the trio was 
 picked up by an rcaf otter at the eastern end of great central lake and flown the twenty miles down 
 the lake to the mouth of drinkwater creek with some nimble foot work the party landed bade hello and goodbye 
 to a few rather mystified onlookers and started to walk up drinkwater creek towards the delia falls it had been 
 decided that this attempt to cross the island range via delia falls would be made from east to west the 
 path up the creek followed an old road that had been built by miners in past years the bush was 
 wet and heavy with blueberries huckleberries and salmonberries by mid afternoon the weather had begun to lift slightly and the 
 sky had brightened cheerfully the path now and then crossed the stream on improvised bridges and upon occasion became part 
 of the stream the latter occurred as the party neared the upper waters of the creek 
 the patrician 29 the first glimpse of delia falls provided a thrill and the trekkers moved on jeagerly to make 
 camp for the night near the foot of the falls by five o clock a good campsite had been selected 
 and preparations were underway for the evening meal jthe campsite offered a marvellous view of the falls as they tumbled 
 1 500 feet into idrinkwater creek the volume of water was not too great but the enormity of the jdrop 
 left the onlookers speechless the weather had now cleared and the evening was spent eating and drying clothes the medical 
 officer demonstrated an amazing jappetite when after eating a scrumptious rice pudding blueberry dessert he decided that his pack was 
 going to be too heavy for the tough climbs the following day and iset about eating the two pounds of 
 dates he was carrying the following morning after a reconnaissance of the route had been made the iparty turned west 
 crossed drinkwater creek for the last time and started through dense mountain alder and salmon berry that grew around and 
 through the rock jslide near the base of the falls the plan was to climb on the left of the 
 falls 1 following where possible a trail that had been used by hikers and prospectors in jthe past the slope 
 proved steep and in some places a nylon climbing rope was lused to assist in raising the climbers and their 
 packs progress was slow as repeated short excursions had to be made to determine the best and sometimes the only 
 j route falling rock provided an occasional bad moment as party members clutched ithe cliff to avoid being struck the 
 going was extremely difficult and particularly hard on the arms as almost all movement entailed use of the arms to 
 raise the i body up the cliff as the party climbed the panorama began to unfold beneath them spreading far 
 to the south and great central lake upon reaching the top of the cliff the trekkers found themselves in a 
 small u shaped valley running east and west with the delia falls dropping from the east end of the valley 
 and the west end rising to the ridge which made the island divide empress motors ltd your pontine buieh aentliun 
 uttxlttttt denier victoria b c ev 2 7121 
 the patrician 30 that night camp was made beside the top of the falls the realization that the climb was 
 complete coupled with the magnificent view from the top of the falls filled the trio with a combined feeling of 
 achievement and wonder the morning of the third day found the party eager to get on to the island divide 
 so that they could determine the feasibility of completing the journey to the west the climb along the side of 
 the valley was gradual and there was little vegetation 0:vegeta 0:tion with which to contend at the top of the 
 divide after a few pictures the party commenced their descent following a tiny stream westward believing it to be the 
 headwaters of you creek after about 500 yards the stream became impassable due to falls and the marchers took to 
 the left bank with a view to climbing down the spur which bordered on the creek the descent was most 
 slow in some cases and extremely fast in others several times it was evident that previous parties had taken the 
 same route and the trio took heart knowing they were not alone in selecting this route the descent was completed 
 by three o clock the party then started down the you creek valley and spent five arduous hours forcing their 
 way through the underbrush misery was added to the hard going when a west coast down pour started in the 
 middle of the afternoon this rain continued unabated for the next two days in the last minutes of light the 
 party found a prospector s summer cabin at a gold claim on you creek this cabin had been visited the 
 previous year and now proved to be the difference between an extremely unpleasant night and a rather comfortable one with 
 shelter and warmth the following day was a repitition of the earlier trek as the marchers covered fifteen miles on 
 trails and tracks to arrive at the sea in the early evening their arrival proved most entertaining as the inhabitants 
 of the small lumber camp did not at first believe they had come through from great central lake finally one 
 of the loggers recalled that the year before some soldiers had been turned back but said that they would come 
 again and be successful the occupants of the camp were extremely hospitable offering food clothing and beds to the drenched 
 and tired trio after a good loggers breakfast the following morning the party boarded a federal government fisheries boat that 
 had been previously arranged for and left for tofino at torino they transferred to the rcaf otter and returned to 
 the start point at great central lake and the conclusion of a most successful five day trip the trip proved 
 that given the right time of year and providing that good co ordination and reconnaissance are made the west coast 
 of the island is not impassable in all places in particular that the delia falls trip is most practical and 
 very worthwhile not only for the scenic value but also for the training and experience we sell beauty flowers bring

 range and albert head courses were run for drivers signallers pioneers and in other ancillary specialties during this period when 
 most people would have preferred to be indoors to escape the rain and fog of the west coast the most 
 intriguing portion of the officer and senior nco training was the cloth model exercises much heated discussion was generated over 
 possible solutions 0:solu 0:tions until the pink sheet solution was produced by lt col bruce and calm prevailed early in 
 march officers writing promotion exams journeyed to chilliwack for their three week stay by kind cooperation of the rcaf all 
 managed to return for seventeenth of march celebrations at work point but not in sufficient time to take part in 
 the broom i 100 game late in march support company put on a demonstration for the university school cadet corps 
 at albert head where staff sergeant shine s ranger course training was much in evidence early in april two aircraft 
 from shilo were put at the disposal of the battalion for visual air reconnaissance training the reconnaissance platoon and many 
 officers enjoyed this training seeing much of vancouver island they had never known existed from various altitudes and attidudes in 
 april rifle companies and support company were able to get away on collective training at training areas up island nanoose 
 bay was particularly popular with its abundant supply of oysters the pioneer platoon visited chilliwack for three weeks for bridging 
 training which proved of value later on at concentration the last two weeks of april and first two weeks of 
 may were devoted to training for trooping which took place on the twelfth of may following trooping the battalion began 
 the four week count down to the concentration the battalion sports meet was held from which competitors were selected for 
 the brigade sports day and forced march training began in earnest after the first battalion size exercises a number of 
 individuals found it prudent to refresh their knowledge of voice procedure and tactical drills wainwright major jgc mckinlay mc cd 
 commanded the road party which moved the thousand miles to the concentration over swartz bay tsawwassen ferry then by road 
 to chilliwack osoyoos and south into the usa through tonasket and sand point and then back into canada through cranbrook 
 and the crow s nest pass to fort macleod and then north via calgary to wainwright the road party arrived 
 in wainwright twenty four hours before the rail party and had completed much work in the battalion bivouac area before 
 the arrival of the rail party the bivouac site for phases one and two was west of the battle river 
 and just north west of the junction of red and orange routes it was a nice area but open to 
 the full force of some of the wind storms that followed the battalion lost some tentage in the storms but 
 not as much as brigade headquarters which was located on the east bank of the battle 
 the patrician 41 training was divided into three phases unit combined arms and major exercises it was a good concentration 
 with the pace fast and the problems challenging 0:chal 0:lenging it is considered however that a recitation of the various 
 exercises and jdetails of training would except for the names sound much like former concentrations 0:concen 0:trations only certain notable 
 highlights therefore will be mentioned here some of these were the presence of the royal welsh fusiliers who added much 
 to both military exercises and social affairs in the two sided exercise the successful break out of all first patricia 
 company groups through the positions of the two opposing battalions crossing the ribstone creek on an improvised bridge north of 
 cattlo bridge in the lighter vein three incidents should be mentioned the explosion of a nuclear simulator under the commanding 
 officer s aircraft just after it had taken off fortunately for all those concerned no one was hurt and most 
 fortunately lieutenant colonel bruce has a good sense of humour captain tex wallace learning about horsemanship from the rsm and 
 staff sergeant tredwell the troops re naming exercise sudden clash as exercise sodden splash it was after all the rain 
 on this exercise that the battle river rose to such an extent that it became impassable as the drivers of 
 an rce jeep and an rcasc mail truck found out the road and rail parties returned without incident this should 
 be the last jtime the road party will have to go through the usa as later in the year the 
 rogers pass highway was opened and in future it will be possible to use an all canadian route after returning

 this event es described in greater detail in the special events section in early august 62 lieutenant colonel brown issued 
 his first training directive with respect to first patricias being trained for rotation to europe the battalion has been reorganized 
 on the germany establishment and as a result we have received some new equipment training on this new equipment is 
 well under way land other normal specialty course have also been conducted much emphasis was jagain placed on the hamilton 
 gault trophy and all battalion personnel were at heals range firing determinedly to make marksman physical training is being stressed

 air transportability course was run in november with a team from rivers all who knew him were disappointed not to 
 see major rh graham cd who was priginally scheduled to come out with this group the prospect of going to 
 germany has certainly produced an enthusiastic attitude toward training captain beauregard is instructing in french and captain bell is starting

 the patrician 61 2 bn princess patricia s canadian light infantry training early in 1962 a company with supporting elements 
 and under the command of capt ag caesar boarded a cl3ob hercules and were off to alaska for exercise great 
 bear 2 ppcli with the us 2nd battle group 60th infantry formed a us cdn force this union was a 
 smaller image of sweet briar 1950 a reception committee a barrage of flashing cameras and a frightful temperature of 60 
 degrees below zero met the troops as they landed this immobilizing cold did not last long and the weather became 
 quite acceptable at least to those from north of the 49th the first two weeks were spent in a pre 
 manoeuvre area at tanacross and in addition to training the time was spent in exchanging ideas jump stories and souvenirs 
 with the us forces it was evident from the beginning that both units were on the best of terms and 
 co operation all along the line was excellent at the completion of the pre manoeuvre training phase the company went 
 by c 123 aircraft piloted by the alaskan air guard to elmendorf air force base there they prepared for a 
 para descent on nome where the alaskan scouts were holding the enemy at bay the troops were air landed because 
 of bad weather and went on to win against the aggressor forces the company group returned to their staging area 
 at elmendorf after a short period of reorganization they emplaned and were dropped on healy lake a critical feature between 
 two opposing battle groups the company group took up a defensive position on the axis of the advancing aggressors and 
 fought for time as the us 2nd battle group deployed for action in the final tally a company group was 
 credited with successfully having held their ground and adding new honours to the battle roll in recognition of such mettle 
 the us forces presented capt caesar with a citation and a similar citation to the company all members of the 
 company keenly enjoyed working with the americans in alaska and their stay with the go devils nickname of the 60th 
 must be recorded as a great success during january and february the unit provided 30 personnel for cold weather tests 
 at fort churchill man the members of the trial team under capt j stutt were volunteers the group spent approximately 
 35 days on the itra il and learned how to build and live in snow caves igloos and lean tos 
 the training received was more thorough and intense than the churchill winter warfare course combat clothing parkas sleeping bags underwear 
 toques and face masks were tested after a month or so of such frigid living the 30 eskimos returned to 
 the hamilton gault barracks there is no denying the captivating power of the north except for the commander the same 
 30 have volunteered again for churchill duties the unit courses began in late february these coupled with army courses while 
 raising the professional standard of the individual brought sub unit training to a standstill during april the battalion rotated companies 
 through camp wainwright where annual classification and tactics at sub unit level were conducted because of the large influx of 
 recruits d company was extremely busy with new soldier training which ran on into the wainwright concentration 
 the patrician 62 the month of may was possibly the heaviest of the training year it was 1 month of 
 sub unit tactics sports and inspections an airborne exercise in whi i a company practiced the defence of an airhead 
 took place on the 8 m s gusty and unpredictable winds caused several injuries the battle efficiencj tests were conducted 
 over three days in early may all ranks with few exception c completed the tests successfully 1 on 11 may 
 an inter company track meet was held the outstanding athlete from the various events were chosen for the battalion team 
 the prowess of thesg athletes was of a high calibre and so it had to be to successfully compete again 
 f the fine athletes at 1 cibg sports meet coupled with the sports programme v a r the battalion s 
 preparation for the goc s inspection and the trooping the forrre was held on may 29 and despite the dreadful 
 rain the drill was excellent s after the wainwright concentration and august leave period the battali a returned to its 
 second home camp wainwright this time instead of movemen to and from hides and battle positions all traffic was to 
 and from the range practices were fired and scored for the hamilton gault skill at arms troph c the mechanical 
 target range is a delightful innovation even if it is difficult to lil whether the target fell from a direct 
 hit or from a sudden wainwright gust s as the fall progressed so did the individual training programme unit course 
 gave way to sub unit and unit training on 10 oct a company did an airbor f exercise at wainwright 
 the ground fog was extremely heavy and participai i will remember the tedious orbital flying it imposed on the rcaf 
 once on til ground things began to move swiftly and the exercise was a complete succe in november a fan 
 out exercise was held the alert came without advam t warning the unit quickly assembled in the barracks and as 
 vehicles were load if they moved off to westlock which is 50 miles north of edmonton many soldier j are 
 credited with making their own way out to the assembly area the second week in december found the unit in 
 wainwright again doiil sub unit winter training companies paired off and this resulted in enthusias iij and competitive training alpha 
 company conducted another airhead defen exercise in conjunction with the airborne signals and medicals from calgary fol d company the 
 young soldier company winter training was a new and interesti i experience having reached sub unit level in winter tactics 
 the personnel of tliij company were posted to reinforce the remainder of the battalion camp wainwright concentration unlike the previous 
 year there was no re entry exercise to introduce til battalion to the wainwright concentration the battalion moved straight to

 squadron were well prepared for any assignment sudden clash nicknamed sudden splash and counter power were two brigade exercises held 
 prior to the goc s exercise the heavy rain during sudden clash made many of the routes impassable not one 
 dry item of clothing could be found in the unit exercise counter power was a onesided 0:one 0:sided exercise with 
 the brigade counter attacking in support of nuclear weapons 9th exercises stressed rapid movement and the battalion found itself moving 
 from one end of camp to the other the summer s training was culminated with exercise lightning strike which was 
 directed and controlled by the goc western command the friendly forces 1 cibg concentrated on the west side of the 
 battle river and opposed the enemy 1 royal welch fusiliers 1 rwf the two patricia battalions crossed the battle river 
 together while 2 qor of c was in reserve the battalion crossed at seberts ford and south of saville ford 
 then made a rapid dash to ribstone creek a coy had earlier captured the cattalo bridge by means of a 
 para drop this year s concentration was unique in that it was the first time the brigade had worked as 
 a complete formation this was possible because 1 rwf of the british army attended the concentration and made an excellent

 the patrician 73 home station officers mess the year 1962 saw few changes in the officers mess after the extension 
 to the dining room in 1961 the 2lc s new rock garden constructed in the circle in front of the 
 mess presented an appealing sight when the flowers were in full bloom and considerably enhanced the appearance of the approach 
 and entrance to the mess until the flowers and shrubs were planted the rock garden was nicknamed stonehenge but soon 
 lost its name when the 2ic had some of the officers weeding the garden during coffee break a small but 
 socially active as well as battle wise group of officers joined the us army in alaska for several weeks in 
 january and february 1962 and made a good impression on the us soldiers with whom they came in contact while 
 the night life in alaska has done little to attract the tourist trade the well known ability of the canadian 
 soldier to make the best of what there is has not died in recent years stories from exercise great bear 
 entertained members of the mess for many months and we expect more of the same in 1963 strange rumours began 
 early on march 17th to the effect that someone had been handcuffed by unknown assailants before the home station parade 
 a pair of handcuffs did appear during the battle for the inter mess broom i 100 championship 0:champion 0:ship but 
 no one was ever seen wearing them through sheer quantity not quality the sergeants mess obtained the coveted championship in 
 traditional fashion the ladies joined the officers at dinner that evening bringing to a close an excellent day of festivities 
 in may the mess honoured lt col jk mahoney vc cd at a mess dinner on the eve of his 
 retirement from the regular army a number of distinguished guests attended the dinner and the air was heavy with the 
 memories of these officers as they reminisced of times past the first breath of spring in 1962 saw an unprecedented 
 increase in interest in outdoor sports among the officers particularly those who habitually took lunch in the mess on weekdays 
 soon the bar was emptied at noon and through the windows could be heard the excited cries of competition and 
 the dull thud of mallet on ball several notable occasions proved the worth of the game to the officers ken 
 crichton found himself subaltern to the escort the evening before the trooping the colour as fred berry had struck himself 
 on the ankle with a mallet during an interesting game that noon many a wrinkled brow relaxed at camp wainwright 
 when a group of officers found a free moment at the field mess for a game again the highly skilled 
 officers team proved its mettle conclusively when it decisively defeated the sergeants team for the only win of the fall 
 intermess 0:inter 0:mess sports afternoon despite this valiant effort the wrong half of the two piece inter mess sports trophy 
 spent the entire year adding its somewhat dubious charms to the decor of the bar again in 1962 the members 
 found time amid the more formal occasions for some outstanding informal events most notable of these was the beatnik party 
 in october at which the depressed state of modern art and the deplorable state of modern morals were investigated thoroughly 
 incidentally the consumption chart of cheap wine in edmonton was seen to take a sudden rise the subalterns court was 
 in evidence again in november and on a separate occasion an evening of serious instruction into the way of life 
 and the stringent code of the junior airborne infantry officer was given cheerfully to brigadier bf macdonald the new commander

 claimed to have lost the recipe and made it out of his head to celebrate the battle of frezenberg on 
 may 8 a mixed formal dinner was held it is hoped that this will shorten the question period the next 
 time a mess dinner is held and members are late getting home the last of the mess functions before the 
 concentration the cocktail party on 7 june and trooping ball on june 9 were enjoyed by all the mess continued 
 to be quite active during the concentration being host to the remaining members of the officers mess and enjoying the 
 company of the royal welch fusiliers at various times as they moved to and from wainwright the mess was presented 
 with their flash mounted on a plaque to commemorate our close association with them the annual children s picnic was 
 held on july 28 several rides were hired for the occasion and the afternoon was enjoyed by the children despite 
 the periodic showers of rain the day was climaxed with a come as you are party in the mess after 
 the children were put to bed shortly after the leave period the officers sgts had their annual games tournament which 
 included badminton volleyball soccer and croquet croquet was introduced at the last minute by the officers when they saw how 
 poorly they were doing in the other events 
 the patrician 78 on oct 20 a millionaires night was held followed on nov 3 by a sadie hawkins dance

 at the officers mess bingos began again in oct and continued to run each saturday evening under the management of 
 ssgt dodd on boxing day a tea dance was held in the afternoon for the first time and if the 
 turnout is any indication of its popularity it will probably become an annual affair corporals mess 1962 opened many new 
 horizons in the mess beginning with a combined new year s eve ball with the privates which proved most successful 
 many alterations were made to the mess during the past year one in particular was the folding partition installed between 
 the privates and the corporals bar which enlarged the corporals mess considerably this extra space was converted into a games 
 room for which a new shuffleboard was purchased a shuffleboard league was formed and did well for its first year 
 the old games room was converted into a tv room and the original tv room used as a mixed lounge 
 with the added enjoyment of a stereophonic hi fi set lt looks as though the corporals mess prospered in this 
 period of austerity social activities were not as frequent as in 61 with only a birthday dance being held on 
 march 17 in honour of the regimental birthday april and may brought the familiar sounds of drill movements on the 
 square in preparation for the goc s inspection and the trooping the trooping once again was highlighted by the combined 
 efforts of the privates and the corporals in the magnificent trooping ball on june 16th the mess closed its doors 
 and once again members invaded wainwright for another summer of exercises and on their completion a month of leave september 
 came and with members returning from leave the mess once again returned to normal a new mess committee was elected 
 and many social functions planned beginning with a most successful hard times dance on october 31 added enjoyment was had 
 by the presentation of live pigs and chickens as prizes to the winners of the door prize and spot dances 
 the final social activity of 1962 was the turkey bingo held november 30 support of this event proved overwhelming although 
 the mess lost many of its members during 1962 it gained many new ones and looks forward to an even 
 better year in 1963 
 the patrician 79 the loyal edmonton regiment 3 ppcli 1962 activities the regiment experienced another successful training year in 1962 
 under the leadership of commanding officer lt col el boyd cd colonel gdk kinnaird ed remained as honourary colonel until 
 late in the year when he relinquished this post to a former commanding officer brigadier jc jefferson cbe dso ed 
 the training highlight of the year occurred in may when liri valley day was celebrated by exercise wapiti river 1 
 in grande prairie a total of 325 troops took part in the exercise coming from edmonton dawson creek peace river 
 and grande prairie after the church parade the regimental colour was paraded through the city for the first time camp 
 wainwright summer camp was held during the first week of july and was attended by 380 members of the unit 
 all ranks training was interesting and instructive with 2 ppcli supplying instructors with support company weapons for the full week 
 the past year also saw a major change in that extra curricular activities were made available to those personnel wanting 
 to take advantage of this additional training a regimental drill team a judo club and fencing club were organized and 
 all generated a great deal of interest and enthusiasm among participants the drill team was by far the most successful 
 of the three activities and the 28 members through hard work and plenty of practise developed a striking similarity to 
 guardsmen in their drill and deportment their achievements resulted in an invitation to mount a quarter guard at the entrance 
 to the hamilton gault barracks for the annual trooping of 2 bn in june the guard was inspected by the 
 deputy chief of the supreme allied command europe general sir hugh stockwell gcb kbe dso at wainwright camp the drill 
 team was again invited to provide a quarter guard for the cgis general sir richard hull gcb dso adc who 
 was visiting western canada the 1962 fall training program started a little later than usual although the young soldier training 
 commenced on time the regiment is again the training wing for the young soldiers intake from all units headquartered in 
 the prince of wales armouries the signal platoon which was organized last year has been expanded under lieutenant peter jones 
 and support company personnel are carrying on adventure training with 2 bn with the continually growing interest in national survival 
 training the regiment was able to expand to the town of peace river during the past year in early 1962 
 the anti tank platoon was authorized at peace river and strength now is up to 39 at that point

 at dawson creek plus peace river personnel a recent statement issued by the commanding officer will be of interest to 
 former members of the unit it is becoming increasingly obvious to those of us intimately connected with the militia role 
 in national survival that the tasks allotted to us should the ultimate disaster ever occur are enormous and probably beyond 
 our present resources to this end it is my intention to propose to ex officers and nco s of the 
 unit that they register with us and be appointed to specific jobs for survival within our allotted tasks if there 
 were to be a good response one day a year could be set aside for lectures and demonstrations for this 
 group more information on this proposal can be expected in the new year not least in the year s activities 
 was the re organization of the regimental band under wo 1 graham smith his proposals for recruitment of new musicians 
 and training of the band have been most encouraging and the band is fast progressing 0:progres 0:sing to a new 
 high among the key promotions and appointments during the past year was that of wo 1 dw mcvee cd to 
 the appointment of regimental sergeant major rsm mcvee enlisted in the edmonton regiment on september 11 1939 and served with 
 the unit until the battle for ortona after which he was posted to shaef he rejoined the unit in 1949 
 and served in several capacities prior to his new appointment major w ross was promoted from captain in the early 
 fall and captain a breckenridge was promoted captain and adjutant the success of the regiment this year is due in 
 great part to the hard work of the officers and senior ncos and also to the tremendous co operation received

 the patrician 82 3rd green jackets the rifle brigade the rifle brigade write cheerfully from cyprus where they have now 
 been for over a year they seem to have dropped quickly into the changeless ways of the middle east and 
 describe the usual scenes so familiar to older riflemen the pi dogs the scrawny chickens the dilapidated bazaars the lunatic 
 lorry drivers are apparently still all there and flourishing nevertheless the battalion seems to have had a good deal of 
 fun of one sort or another and we hear encouraging reports of trips to greece north africa and kenya and 
 of an expedition to the lebanon some of the riflemen have also been able to sail dinghys and catamarans and 
 many have sampled for the first time the delights of gliding skiing water skiing goggle fishing and aqualung diving many 
 own their own motor cars and spend much time exploring the island the oftenheard 0:often 0:heard accusation that cyprus is 
 a splendid station for officers but not much use for the private rifleman does not seem to be entirely accurate 
 but life is not all sailing and skiing and last spring the entire battalion went over to cyrenaica for about 
 a month where they sampled some of the joys of desert campaigning they caught the desert at its best and 
 write enthusiastically of life in a company column in the djebel an interesting exercise took place in which the battalion 
 held the charruba gap and then carried out a night withdrawal along the track to mechile one cannot help wondering 
 if by chance they saw the ghosts of any old riflemen along that historic route it is surprising how many 
 carried out precisely the same manoeuvre under grimmer circumstances twenty years ago colonel hew butler took over command of the 
 battalion on 22nd july after a brief hand over from colonel grismond davies scourfield who is now brigade colonel the 
 new colonel at once organized a gruelling march competition over a course of 29 miles which included a climb of 
 4 500 feet the idea of doing such a thing in the middle of the hot weather in the middle 
 east may seem strange to an older generation of riflemen but apparently the modern rifleman likes it for we read 
 of a coy finishing the course singing to win the cup in six hours and forty minutes a pretty good 
 performance in any circumstances cyprus as always is a great meeting place for travellers and so far from being cut 
 off from the rest of the world the battalion seems to have had a full ration of visitors a large 
 number of sailors have been entertained both from the inshore minesweeping flotilla and 7th destroyer squadron rn not to mention 
 representatives 0:repre 0:sentatives of the italian israeli jordanian and turkish armies 
 the patrician 83 members of the rifle brigade with some of their trophies won in the cyprus theatre as so 
 often it has been very difficult for the battalion to maintain any continuity of officers or men and no less 
 than fourteen officers have left during the year and fifteen have been posted in yet they appear to take it 
 all in their stride in the world of sport they have enjoyed themselves a great deal without being able to 
 take part in the big army competitions they have played a lot of polo on the miscellaneous collection of ponies 
 belonging to the cyprus saddle club they were narrowly beaten in the final of the cyprus soccer cup and came 
 second in the cross country championships they ran a flourishing rugger side which has never been an easy thing to 
 do in the regiment and they swept the board in the local rifle meet beating their old friends and rivals 
 of baor days the gloucester regiment the latter had beaten the battalion team in the brigade rifle meeting in germany 
 in 1959 so victory must have tasted sweet apart from a period on salisbury plain in 1953 and 1954 which 
 no one seemed to enjoy much the battalion has been stationed abroad since 1941 they have been in north africa 
 italy north west europe germany twice kenya malaya and now cyprus fighting all over the world in the words of 
 2 rb s regimental call it is good news indeed to hear of them so well and happy and sustaining

 harvey reti with the ppcli depot in edmonton were among those chosen to represent canada at the british empire and

 two patricias both well known in boxing circles they were selected to attend the canadian army boxing training camp held 
 in edmonton in the summer of 1962 at this camp they were selected to represent the army at the british 
 empire games boxing trials held at the canadian national exhibition in toronto in september their success at these trials reflected 
 great credit on army boxing standards as well as marking them as outstanding canadian boxers selection to the canadian contingent 
 for the be and c and c games gave these patricias an opportunity to visit our sister dominion and even 
 manage a glimpse at life on several south sea islands enroute as one would expect they found it a very 
 rewarding experience and thoroughly enjoyed their stay and the hospitality extended by the australian people cpl fredericks fighting in the 
 light heavy weight division was unfortunate in losing his first bout by a decision but cpl reti in the light 
 welterweight managed to bring home a bronze medal after two wins both are reported to be active in boxing in
