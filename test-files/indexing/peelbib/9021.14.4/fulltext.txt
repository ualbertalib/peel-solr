 with my work ever irked me so much as being given credit or discredit for having lccated the edson trail
 although i did authorize the changing of some small portions of it after it was turned over to me for
 completion i had nothing to do with its location and i was never consulted concerning it even j g macgregor
 good historian that he is in his book the land of twelve foot davis probably after consultation with some of
 the settlers wrote that the provincial government had me select the route before the work on it was started no
 examination of any kind was made before the contract was given to cut a road from medicine lodge to grande
 prairie it is only fair to john stocks then deputy minister of public works to say that he had been
 informed by people he thought reliable but who had never been over the ground that the trail would go through
 park like country instead of the roughest part of alberta aside from the rocky mountain section in the spring of
 1904 i foolishly left anne the most important was the immy employment with the canadian paci provement and some relocation
 of the fic railway and joined a bridge building trail from lac ste anne to whitecourt crew working for the
 territorial govern which road served until the present road ment we worked throughout what is from whitecourt to valleyview was
 now saskatchewan in the construction paved of ferries and wood and steel bridges up to this time i had given
 some our work was discontinued during study to engineering and surveying but the winter months late in 1907 i made
 i increased my studies from that lime on a trip to edmonton where i met mr and although my knowledge
 of them stocks who offered me employment with was all that was needed for my work it his work force
 which i accepted and was also such that when i was given went of work with alex munro the supervision
 of the whole peace river next year i was put on my own and district then the largest engineering covered
 most of the settled parts in district in alberta no objection was building bridges of various kinds and made to
 my appointment by the enthe construction of ferries gineering institute of alberta early in the summer of 1910 mr in
 the meantime i had heard ru mcintyre the chief engineer asked that mours of the contract given to clear a
 i be made assistant to mr mcintosh then road from medicine lodge to grande in charge of the location and
 coristruc prairie but i was not given any partition of roads in the areas through which culars the fact was
 that they had conthe grand trunk pacific and the cana traded to put the road through for 5 000 dion
 northern railways were building which their packer told me was less than i refused the offer on the ground that
 i they were being paid to clear base lines was not experienced enough in the kind of work to take
 on the responsibility after my work on the ste anne later the offer was repeated with the whitecourt section was
 finished mr comment that they were having most stocks directed me to make an examinatrouble with men who know it
 all tion of the country from whitecourt to thus assured i accepted and worked on the little smoky river with
 a view to various roads in the vicinity of lac ste opening a road through that area in mr mcquarrie
 is o well known alberta pioneer and was the author of the 1913 provincial election carried in our winter 1959
 number he is flow a resident of edmonton those years road funds were so small the facts about the decision
 to build a that locations had to be on solid ground road from medicine lodge mr stocks was very much
 under the impression that no such ground could be it was near the end of the year that found in
 the area in this he was right he asked me to examine and report on if the route of the
 hash lake pack trail the condition of the road then cut out to were to be used i hired horses
 from near the athabasca river i thought it john gocdvin trader at whitecourt and was the worst road i had
 ever seen the i hired his brother bert to accompany terrain was very rough and i thought me the choice
 was a goad one for he the clearing such that it left much to be was a pleasant travelling companion
 desired for winter travel i realize now had trapped through that area and had that my report was very indiscrete
 and been to grande prairie was written with the hope that it would stop further work being done on that
 we travelled the pack trail north route it is probable that the officials in west to near where the house
 river en charge thought that my lack of knowters the little smoky river from there ledge of such work had
 much to do with we went south along the east bank of the my attitutde in any case i was
 notified little smoky to west of a beautiful little that the railway then building towards whitecourt would reach grande prairie
 lake the name of which i have forgotten thence west acrcss the river into the in a year and in
 the meantime the trail would serve those who wished to go valley of the toney river named by me after
 the toney river in nova scotia through with saddle horses or lightly loaded wagons where i spent my early boyhood
 feed for our horses had been very scarce since the prophets were confused because leaving whitecourt so we decided to
 the edscn board of trade undertook to let them feed for a day in the lush grass cut a road
 from edson to the athabasca of the valley of the toney i continued river to intersect the contractors road walking
 west until well up on high at that point and the business people of ground but did not see any
 signs of the edson together with the local news medicine lodge trail which some out paper advertised the route all
 over the riders thought should be cut out to near continent as the gateway of the north sturgeon lake by
 that time the result was that box cars of settlers effects were arriving in edson and set on our return
 to whitecourt we took tlers started north before the road was time to choose firm ground and we cut cut
 far north of the little smoky river and blazed a trail as we went because needless to say the contractors
 realized of large stretches of wind fallen timber by this time that their contract as well our progress was very
 slow and some as their real estate venture was due to days did not exceed a mile a few years
 fail the government in consultation later this wind fallen timber was burned with them agreed to put a government by
 a forest fire the weather had turned crew on the work and i was selected as quite cold and slush
 ice was running in the one to see that the road was put the river so when we reached where
 the through railway had surveyed their crossing of the river we decided to cross and go to i was responsible
 for the building of whitecourt i proceeded to edmonton the ferries for which the ancient art of which i reached
 on a saturday night whip sawing had to be revived for the i met mr stocks on the street and
 he construction of the first three i was asked me to meet him in his office sun also responsible for
 the framing of some day morning so he could get first hand truss bridges required on other streams information on
 what i had found i told these responsibilities prevented me from him that after the athabasca river had having much
 to do with location after frozen over i was planning on going out the contractors quit work it was a
 metis to explore the balance of the route i named larocque from the sturgeon lake had blazed from the little
 smoky river indian reserve who did most of the to whitecourt it was then he gave me locating from the
 little smoky river to 2 members of the road camp on the edson trail were photographed in about 1911 these
 men tried to make the road passable for settlers gding to the grande prairie sturgeon lake i do not say
 the location prairie some months later caused a senwould have been better if i had done sation but that is
 not a part of this story it it might have been worse the main he asked me to share his
 bed with him stress however was on how to avoid which offer i was glad to accept in the heavy
 clearing morning i went on to where the main bunch was stranded we s p e n t the during
 the winter i had some stormy whole day planning the work i had met sessions with mr stocks he did
 the one of their number previously a mr storming because of the length of time mosier and i planned to
 make him foreit was taking to cut the road through man he refused however and suggested easy clearing i appoint
 elmer e davison one of a one evening on my way to work party of three from weyburn saskatche most
 of the travelling was done on foot wan the others were dr r n shaw because of lack of feed
 for horses i met who later carried on a successful practhe mail contractor who told me that not tice at
 sexsmith but who died at an only the contractor s crew but also the early age and harvey switzer who
 government crew had quit work and operated a drug store in edson for many were on the road coming in
 the gov years and is now retired mr davison ernment foreman told me his c r e remained with me
 as a road foreman panicked lest they be caught on the for several years and was one of the north
 side of the river when it broke best he started a ranch near watino up and that they would starve
 to death where he died he offered to go back and make a fresh start but i refused and i
 decided to go after arranging for the work to conon until i overtook the settlers who had tinue i started
 to walk back to the ferry started out from edson in the hopes that camp i knew i would have
 to spend at they could get all the way through at least one night on the trail as it was
 the ferry building camp i borrowed their a clear night i decided it was best not team of horses with
 driver to take me to risk the weather being good the folas far as the toney river where we lowing
 night i carried lunches and by spent the night in the morning he re the following night i had reached
 a turned to his regular work and i started point about three miles south of the walking through the deep
 snow to over little smoky where the trail was cut take the settlers it was dark before i through dry
 jackpine windfall being reached them somewhere south of the tired i decided to rest a short while i house river
 crossing laid some poles on the snow set fire in the dry wood beside the trail and lay the first
 i overtook was al hunter down to rest i did not intend to sleep a good fellow whose action in
 grande but all at once i realized that something 3 was wrong i had fallen asleep and the along the
 simonette river to the big fire had flared up and burned the smoky where he arrived as the ice was
 clothes off my back i fixed up the best breaking up mr robertson managed i could and started out again
 i reached to cross and went on to bear lake where the ferry camp completely exhausted he arranged with henry
 roberts to cut about 4 p m the next day but i had lain the trail from the smoky river
 to sturdown in the snow six times in the last geon lake unlike the rest of the district mile that
 part remained dry until about midsummer and many favourable comments in april of 1911 mr stocks decided were made about
 the nice dry road mr to come over the trail with j d robert roberts opened after mid summer we
 son chief engineer of the dept of public travelled over it together and a dis works jim cornwall and me
 accom appointed man he was we attended panying him he and i rode saddle a gathering of the indians at
 sturgeon horses and for the others a buckboard lake and we smoked the pipe of peace and a team of
 horses was provided the with them mr stocks and mr cornwall snow was so deep that the axles of the
 went back by the winter road via lesser buckboard levelled it down steady but slave lake i accompanied them as
 far slow progress was made one day when as the little smoky river which i riding somewhere north of the
 baptiste helped them to cross and i then went river now called the berland river back to edson alone mr
 stocks apologized for some of the things he had said about the slow pro no one realizes any better than
 i gress being made in getting the road do the hardships some people endured cut through he mentioned that i
 had on the trail on the other hand many told him about the conditions to be con of the stories
 told and published are the tended with but that he could not corn greatest bunk philip godsell the writer prehend
 them i then told him i had of the story the romance of the alaska planned to quit work but
 he pleaded highway wrote that the first settlers with me to stay with him for as he said on grande
 prairie lived on rabbits and i need you in the opening up of the the flesh of wild horses that
 roamed north he offered me a substantial in that area i rode some of those wild crease of wages which
 while not large horses after they were tamed but i in comparison with present day wages have never heard of
 any one having was enough to convince me i could not eaten their flesh he also wrote of the do
 as well elsewhere hence the start babies that were born on the trail and of my long years of employment
 in the also how processions of settlers would north stop while they constructed a coffin for one of their dead
 while the general public thought there was a lot of muskeg on the trail there were not any deaths on
 the the amount was comparatively small edson trail except a drowning in the the largest being just on the north
 bank smoky river one time when the ferry of the baptiste river it was the first to was out of
 service i was walking tobe corduroyed the fact is that the sum wards the river one day when i met
 a mer of 1911 was very wet and after several loaded wagons went over wet young fellow going back to
 the road to meet other members of his family who ground it became a quagmire the incidently settled in the
 halcourt disquickest way and most practical way trict he told me this boy who when to repair such places was
 to corduroy h e m sometimes the corduroy was he heard the ferry was not running covered sometimes not which
 caused hurried on to the river with the intenmuch discomfort to those riding wagons tion of swimming across it he
 was but it did keep the trail passable taken downstream by the swift current and drowned there was one birth
 on as the trail had not been cut out the trail at the jackfish lake stopping from sturgeon lake west
 mr stocks place where a baby by the name of and party travelled the winter trail david turner was born
 there was noth 4 ing very unusual about it as dr r n often wondered how they made out in
 shaw was on continuous employment the rough terrain without boots on the trail and in the next stopping place a
 practical nurse lived and no one morning in early spring i ardoubt their services were available the rived on foot
 at the athabasca river baby now farms at grande prairie and i found several men who told me that a
 settler driving a team of horses amusing incidents to some people attached to a sleigh in which there occurred from
 time to time in summer were several items of settlers effects i used a saddle horse and i carried a
 had ignored their advice that crossing small silk tent on my saddle to keep on the ice would be unsafe
 and had off the dew and rain one evening driven right on to it the result was about 100 miles
 from edson i had hob that when about half way across the bled my horse and had my tent up
 when river his team broke through the ice i noticed two swedes preparing their they said he did not even
 look back bed i invited them to share the tent but proceeded north on the trail the with me but
 they declined the offer i men at the river salvaged the harness forgot to warn them that the rabbits and
 proceeded to store the contents of which were very plentiful in that part his sleigh would eat leather which had
 been exposed to perspiration because of its salt i proceeded on my way and several content drivers of horses always
 hung miles farther on i found him in a store their harness up in trees to avoid this house belonging
 to the mail contractor happening when i woke early the he was in an agitiated state of mind next morning
 the swedes were making and tried to assure me that he was not a commotion and when i looked out
 doing any harm to my property i fitted found the rabbits had eaten their boots him with a heavy pair
 of socks of which i could not do anything to help them i always carried an extra pair and i
 and i never saw them again but i have directed him to the ferryman s stopping in order to provide
 facilities for settlers along the edson trail a number of stopping houses were built this one was at the crossinq
 of the little smoky river place at the little smoky river he told one time i was talking to a
 man who me to take anything belonging to him became a settler of the west grande which he had left
 at the athabasccx prairie when a man who became promi river i did not take any of it and i
 nent as a settler nearer grande prairie never saw him again a person who town rode up to where we
 were standing claims he saw him told me he said if near the little smoky river and absentit had not
 been for me he would have mindedly asked me if i could tell him committed suicide where he could water
 his horse i replied a former citizen of grande prairie that i would let him drink out of the now
 deceased used to tell how in the river he replied that s a good idea city of toronto they always
 used a pail i will not repeat the blasphemy i heard to water their horses so when he rode the
 man i was talking to say under his to grande prairie over the hash lake breath incidents of similiar kind
 can pack trail he carried a pail on his arm be repeated but the above is sufficient all the way
 from edmonton so he could to indicate some of those that occurred water his horse at the creeks and rivers
 on the trail an alternative capital there seems to be every likelihood that the dominion government will extend some form
 of territorial autonomy to the north west at the approaching session of parliament we do not believe that the full
 powers of a local provincial government will be given with all the expensive concomitants attached thereto and we think this
 is wise because local government of that kind would mean little more than the very doubtful luxury of taxing ourselves
 now what we propose as a reasonable claim for calgary is that the annual meeting of the territorial delegates should
 be held alternately with regina in this town calgary has more than double the population of any other town in
 the territories its volume of business is three or four times that of regina and its aggregate assessment equally greater
 there would be a direct advantage to the government of the territories in having their annual meeting one year in
 the west and the next year in the east in order to legislate wisely and well the legislators should have
 as great a knowledge as is possible of the varying conditions necessities and peculiarities of all portions of the country
 affected by the laws which they will be called upon to make and administer this knowledge can only be acquired
 by the personal contac of the members as far as possible with the people of all parts of the country
 and the personal observation of their peculiar needs the claim that we make for calgary is therefore based on the
 strong grounds of public utility aside altogether from the claims of greater commercial importance and preponderance in size of our
 town we think that something in the nature of a petition should go forward from the people of calgary and
 alberta generally to the government at ottawa asking that when the change in the council is being made it should
 include the proposal set forth above we believe the federal ministry and the house of commons would perceive on public
 grounds the great utility of the change calgary tribune dec 10 1887 samuel hume blake ev w the anglican church

 at blackfoot crossing to work among the blackfoot indians and to look after the spiritual welfare of the settlers adjacent
 to the reserve in the following year he established a day school thus following the lead of other pioneer missionaries
 who could not perceive of their christianizing activities without it involving some aspects of education in 1885 h w g

 of forty pounds a year from the anglican church in addition to the government per capita grant l the two
 men continued their work among the blackfoot indians until the summer of 1888 when mr stocken was transferred to the

 in the work to increase the number of the children at the schools by 1891 the three day schools had
 not only for the good of the christian 106 pupils enrolled while the boarding work but also to increase the

 general hospital for edmonton the requirements of the country he thought pointed towards the construction of a general hospital and
 he desired to know what assistance the town council would likely give towards the object he did not appear there
 as the roman catholic priest but as a citizen of the town of edmonton the hospital would not be a
 denominational one but would be public and conducted in the public interests by the grey nuns who would devote their
 services to this charitable work the local doctors agreed to assist and encourage the institution provided that no regular doctor
 was appointed and patients were allowed their choice of doctors patients too were also to be allowed their choice of

 s earlier emutries as i eer foot 19 origin of the calgary stampede by guy weadick guy weadick the story
 of the calgary stampede its origin and its success is the story of the west itself it was not conceived
 nor was it ever designed by its original sponsors to be just an ordinary cowboy show it was never intended
 to be so similar in presentation with many other offerings of a western nature that often cause the expression when
 you have seen one stampede or rodeo you have seen them all there are a few good reasons why the
 stampede at calgary right from the beginning was different as a youth i had worked on ranches visited calgary with
 the 101 ranch and later toured all over the united show i discussed with harry mcmullen states and canada and
 was in the a former old time cowman who at that north west territories as early as 1904 time was
 general livestock agent for i had worked on ranches all over the the canadian pacific railway the pos west as
 a hand and had toured with sibilities of presenting an annual fronthe buffalo bill show and the 101 ranch tier
 day celebration there this to wild west show later i toured great include world s championship cowboy britain and continental
 europe on my competitions he thought it was a fine own giving roping exhibitions there idea but said he thought
 it was about two years too soon for the growing city on my early visit to the canadian of calgary
 north west i had been impressed with the vast country open for settlement and during the next few years i
 maindevelopment in 1908 when i next tamed a correspondence w it h mr 20 mcmullen on the subject in 1911
 while asked for 60 000 each of these cow i was touring the music halls of great men put up
 25 000 and then informed britain and the halls and circuses of the bank manager that the other 25 000
 continental europe doing my roping act would be supplied by the hon archie together with my wife professionally mclean at
 this time mr mclean did known as flores la due the world s not know he was being included and
 champion lady fancy roper i received did not learn of it until some days later a letter from mr mcmullen
 advising when he arrived in calgary mr me of the land boom in alberta he mclean owner of the cy
 ranch was stated that thousands of settlers were another prominent range cattleman of coming into the country encouraged by alberta
 such were the ways of the the government the railroads and the old west land companies much publicity was being
 given to the advantages awaiting the only instructions i received from settlers when they arrived in the cana my financial
 sponsors were that i was dian north west to carry out the proposed ideas i had submitted them regarding the
 celebra he expressed the opinion that the tion their requests were simple and time was now ripe for me to
 come to clear namely make it the greatest calgary to put my ideas into effect i thing of its kind
 in the world we don t arrived in calgary in march 1912 to want to lose money but we would
 rather see what i could do as to obtaining lose and have it right than make money local financial and
 moral support neces and fail in our objectives those were sary to stage a celebration such as i had the
 only orders i ever received from this long contemplated my earliest con group of public spirited old timers tacts were
 not successful until i was sent for by george lane the noted even in 1912 this was not the first
 pioneer western cattleman owner of the frontier days celebration or cowboy comfamous bar u ranch west of high river petition
 these events had been held after i had outlined my proposition to ever since there were ranches or corn mr
 lane he arranged a meeting with petitions of a cowboy nature and went pat burns the cattle king of western

 country it became a true replica of the ranching interests days that were bruin revenge the town of medicine hat
 had in 1694 an altraction in the shape of a captive grizzly bear he was a hungry looking brute about
 the size of an ordinary cow and was chained to a post in the centre of a strong log pen
 the pen stood beside the tracks about 200 feet from the station and a recent rainstorm had made a reritable
 mudhole of it the bear was an object of lively interest and curiosity to the townspeople but more particularly to
 passengers of trains which stopped at medicine hat to change engines one day early in august the east bound overland
 pulled in and in a few minutes the occupants of several coaches were viewing the grizzly who was snuffling around
 his quarters looking very innocent and unconcerned his paws and shaggy gray coat were covered with mud and bruin was
 not a thing of beauty still he appeared contented and seemed to enjoy being on exhibition now a miscellaneous crowd
 of men has as a rule at least one individual in it belonging to the class known as ‘ smart
 alecks this gathering was no exception and the aforementioned person soon manifested himself he began by grunting at the bear
 and followed that up by throwing sticks and small stones at him failing to excite him by these means he
 restored to others fixing a handkerchief on a stick he flaunted it in bruin s face and tickled him on
 the nose with it then poked him in the ribs but save an occasional growl the bear did not seem
 to mind his tormentor one or two gentlemen now advised the funny man to desist suggesting that his bearship s
 patience probably had limits ignoring the friendly warning the fellow waxed bolder and coming close up to the pen thrust
 an arm in between the logs then the long suffering bear saw his opportunity and improved it suddenly and with
 startling swiftness he reared on his hind legs until he loomed high above the astonished man and then with a
 deep growl of anger he struck fiercely at his persecutor for a breathless second the man stood bereft of the
 power of motion then with a scream of fright he tried to draw back but too late the enormous bear
 caught his arm in a glancing fashion shredding his coat and shirt sleeves and scoring several ugly scratches in the
 flesh while an avalanche of mud and filth descended on his features thickly smearing the whole upper part of his
 person the bear s revenge was complete swift and sudden justice had been meted out and with shaken nerves and
 ruined clothes the smart man made his way to the train while some unfeeling men in the crowd laughed outright
 and the grizzly lay down with what resembled a sigh of relief the canadian pacific east bound overland bore that
 day a man who was not only sadder and wiser but whose propensity for ‘ stirring up animals had received
