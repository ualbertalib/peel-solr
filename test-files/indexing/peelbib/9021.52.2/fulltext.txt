 russell and reminqton and the canadian frontier charlie russell and frederic remington were idealistic young men when they first saw
 ‘ the west in the 1880 s both were brought up in privileged families and both wanted to escape a
 conservative life they looked west to fulfill their dreams remington visited the west throughout his career painting the bold men
 and events he saw there russell moved to montana and became a westerner he painted the west he knew as
 a working cowboy and the romantic west of the past that he imagined remington was the first to look for
 western images in canada securing a commission with prestigious harper s weekly he travelled to alberta in 1887 the legendary
 blackfoot warriors drew him across the border and his art for the next year was full of references to them
 remington also found the north west mounted police impressive and made a special stop in regina to add to his
 sketches he returned to western canada in 1890 and immediately headed for the blackfoot reserve he and writer julian ralph
 paid for a special dance and the stories and sketches from that event filled publications for the next several years
 during his life remington published more than 100 images relating to his experiences in the canadian west an area that
 he saw as a part of the north american western frontier russell acquired first hand knowledge of alberta and the
 landscape in the spring of 1888 passing a lazy summer near high river there he spent time with natives and
 gained an understanding that became increasingly evident as his art matured stories he heard from the blood elder medicine whip
 were translated into numerous sketches paintings sculpture and tales russell s fame as the ‘ cowboy artist quickly spread across
 the northern plains and he began to get canadian commissions for cowboy pictures while some of the requests were for
 cowboys most of them were for native themes drawing on the knowledge he had gained in alberta russell s western
 art was a natural match for guy weadick s new calgary stampede in 1912 his art exhibition was a hit
 and most of the works sold went to titled english visitors russell exhibited at three other canadian stampedes helping to
 shape their public identity with the sketches he supplied these shows also gave him the opportunity to perfect the romantic
 image of the heroic ‘ mountie for the canadian and english market this issue of alberta history serves two purposes
 on one hand it is a regular issue of the quarterly magazine on the other it has been specially designed
 to serve as a companion publication for the exhibition capturing western legends organized by the glenbow museum for the summer
 of 2004 the museum has sought out many original remington and russell works dealing with canada and has received valuable
 guidance and assistance from internationally known scholars brian dippie and peter hassrick public institutions and private collectors from all over
 north america have loaned their art for the first and largest exhibit of its kind a selection of those works
 are illustrated in this publication through those images it becomes clear that charlie russell and frederic remington used much from
 their canadian experiences while creating the image of the ‘ frontier west that is so familiar around the world lorain

 young men on a lark the oldest of them phil weinard was a few months short of twenty five he
 had been knocking around on both sides of the border since arriving in montana in 1880 he had freighted and
 cowboyed in the high river area of alberta returning to the territorial capital helena the previous spring where he had
 met wooed and married his employer s niece phil had a job awaiting him at walter skrine s bar s
 ranch on mosquito creek southwest of calgary due to high water and impassable crossings weinard elected to have his wife

 youngest of the trio b j long green stillwell was a good humoured twenty edmonton and received his phd three

 canadian duty on russell s two horses as well for a total of 20 bought his friends provisions and arranged
 for a cabin for them on charles d m blunt s ranch about five miles west of town there the
 weinard expedition disbanded blunt the well educated son of a british officer had acquired 300 head of cattle and a
 ranch on the highwood river in 1886 but the bar d could hardly be called a working ranch carefree and
 lazy and liked by everyone blunt would have found russell and stiliwell congenial guests his cabin reputedly served as headquarters
 for idlers around the settlement and they fit the bill russell did a little painting courtesy of blunt who being
 a bit of an artist himself gave him a few tubes of paint some brushes and some canvases brought from
 england 2 when these supplies ran out russell loafed away the summer about mid june 1888 he reported to a
 friend back in montana i have reached my stoping place i am slit aying at a cattle ranch on high
 rive r i am not doing aney thing now as i got here to late for the roundup i like
 the coun r y pritty well so far there is lots of indians here they visit us nearly every day
 3 that was it for news but in those few words are the seeds of a cherished russell legend that
 he supposedly spent the winter with the blood indians in alberta indeed russell himself wrote that he lived six months
 with the blackfeet a claim frequently repeated in newspaper biographies 4 although russell did not winter with the blackfoot he
 did make his first sustained contact with indians while in alberta and visited in their camps listening to stories about
 life long ago 5 the blackfuut sarcee and stoney reserves were in close proximity to high river to the nurth
 while the bloods and peigans often passed through on visits from their reserves to the south russell s 1902 painting

 young artist soaked up indian lore during his visit to alberta in august russell and stillwell abruptly ended their canadian
 sojourn since stiliwell was still riding weinard s horse they skipped a courtesy call to him on their way past
 the bar s nor did they stop at fort macleod to claim the 15 customs duties refundable within three months
 paid on their horses when they entered canada in may they were destitute and needed the 15 or so for
 food and footwear but guilt and probably a strong dose of paranoia kept them on a beeline for montana twentyseven
 years later russell would paint a major oil when law dulls the edge of chance 1915 fig 4 showing two

 russell riding grey eagle and leading his packhorse monte reaching out to shake hands with two approaching indians an unfinished
 watercolour sketch of a mounted indian with lance and a pen and ink drawing of a standing indian that closely
 anticipates his oil portrait of an indian the most ambitious painting russell finished in alberta was distinctively canadian iii subject
 matter an oil 18 x 36 it shows two pert mounted policemen escorting three glum indian prisoners and while the
 perspective is dubious and the colours stout it is an important early work its genesis was an experience russell shared

 a blood indian as prisoner weinard recalled we rode alongside of them f r some time and charlie got his
 first impression of a c m p with an indian handcuffed and under arrest 7 weinard mentioned two mounties as
 russell showed but only one indian russell may have taken some liberties by changing the odds canadian mounted police bringing
 in red indian prisoners introduced a novel subject to his repertoire and a speciflc way of treating it plate 2
 it is not only a memento of his summer in alberta it establishes the direct impact that the summer had
 on his art appropriately russell gave the painting to charles blunt as a thank you for artist supplies and a

 line we had our quota of would be bad men here he wrote but their notions were never realized except
 in the bar room the real western man was as a rule an amiable quiet law abiding citizen who minded
 his own business and looked to others to do the same 5 certainly the mounties were in control by 1
 888 when russell summered in alberta and bar rooms were in short supply for canada s north west was officially
 dry the police effectively enforced prohibition to the considerable annoyance of the growing population of white settlers it is hard
 to imagine that russell cottoned to a regime that has been described as a benevolent despotism 1 after all he
 had a cowboy s disdain for the united states army and once asserted i never painted a soldier in my
 life yet he obviously shared the respect for the north west mounted police prevalent on the alberta range five oil
 paintings two water colours the talk paper 1901 and the king s scout 19031 and several pen and ink drawings
 by russell pay tribute to the mounted police as dispensers of a firm but fair brand ofjustice he showed them
 levelling their rifles hut never firing them four of his five oils showed the police making arrests or escorting prisoners
 and while russell instinctively sympathized with indians and outlaws not the forces of law and order each painting expresses his
 admiration for the scarlet coated police a sense of pathos is inescapable in canadian mounted police bringing in red indian
 prisoners but the slumping hapless indians do not detract from their erect alert captors russell paid close attention to the
 indians ponies and the mounties horses which mirror their riders attitudes but even the buffalo skull in the foreground russell
 s symbolic shorthand for the old west fails to condemn this taming of the past when charlie russell next saw
 charlie blunt it was in 1914 in london when europe was on the brink of a catastrophic war russell now
 had a partner of his own literally since nancy cooper russell was his business manager as well as his wife
 it was her astute rnanoeuvring that had brought them across the atlantic to open a oneman exhibition the west that
 has passed at the dore galleries russell exhibited six watercolours and nineteen oils through april 1914 including three paintings of
 the north west mounted police that he had completed since attending the first calgary stampede in 1912 single handed 1912
 fig 6 whiskey smugglers caught with the goods i 91 3 and queen ‘ s war hounds 1914 fig 3
 blunt who now lived in england attended the exhibition he still owned his thankyou gift from russell painted in 1888
 and with his artistic proclivities would have marvelled at the progress evident in russell s recent work his colour sense
 had been transformed and his technical skills enhanced in every area but that splash of scarlet in the unilorrns provided
 a link to canadian mounted police bringing in red indian prisoners and showed that russell s perspective on the police
 had not changed at all indeed single handed could almost be considered a prelude to blunt s painting it shows
 the arrest of a warrior in his own camp by a lone mounted policeman and pays simultaneous tribute to the
 assembled indians who respected valour and to the daring policeman in their midst the tension is conveyed by the defiant
 posture of the armed warrior and the almost delicate touch of the officer as he makes the arrest the tones
 are brilliant and the light gilding the distant hills serves to reinforce the heroic legend of the mounted police who

 gold rushes charlie and nancy boarded a train in great falls and set out to visit the jumping off point
 for the klondike fort edmonton as he styled it he imagined an old time fur post with trappers and indians
 and dog teams towing sleds much like he had seen in photographs of klondikers departing edmonton that image stirred the
 blood of a born romantic but when he got to edmonton he found only a modern city and he could
 not conceal his disappointment his visit to edmonton was for the express purpose of getting a drawing of a dog
 train from life a local reporter noted unfortunately no trains happened to be in from the north but some interested
 friends rigged up a train so that he could see one in actual operation u russell made a quick sketch
 of the dog train on his hotel stationery fig 11 and subsequently inquired into details gathering sufficient information to paint
 a watercolour titled the winter packet 1903 and to create a wax model known as transport to the northern lights
 ca 1903 05 for a couple of weeks in november 1908 and again for a month the following spring russell
 first observed then participated in two buffalo roundups on montana s flathead reservation his watercolours painted in the field document
 a remarkable story the entire herd of more than 700 buffalo had been purchased in 1907 by the canadian government
 at a cost of 245 per head payable upon delivery in alberta russell s companions on the 1909 roundup included
 canadian officials he sent an amusing letter fig 10 to howard douglas commissioner of dominion parks at banff who was
 his host and two canadian photographers newton mactavish and m 0 hammond who produced a visual record that complemented his
 own hammond also made a fine portrait of russell in their tent painting a watercolour pablo s buffalo hunt 1909
 plate 5 they run more than cattle the artist recalled of the buffalo he chased and they kick an strike
 like a hoss 2 such firsthand observations benefited russell s art generally reinvigorating his interest in buffalo and in particular
 buffalo hunts canada had again exerted an indirect but powerful impact on his work 55 besides subject matter drawn from
 his experiences in alberta russell s art benefited from patronage relationships forged in western canada that eventually reached overseas to
 england and measurably advanced his reputation one of the earliest involved william bleasdell cameron a former hudson s bay company
 employee and a survivor of frog lake who was imprisoned in big bear s cree camp for two months in
 1885 cameron as the representative of a new st paul based sportsman s journal western field and stream was enthralled
 by russell s work when he saw it on display in butte in 1897 he went out of his way
 to meet the artist and his new wife in cascade where russell in turn had to be enthralled by cameron
 s credentials as an indian wars captive the result was a commission to paint and sketch a pictorial history of
 western life to be reproduced in successive issues of cameron s journal 3 apart from one lewis and clark painting
 the subjects chosen were generic in the meantime cameron published a story inspired by a russell painting he had seen
 in butte showing a sultry indian woman keeoma 1896 thereby contributing to the legend that in 1888 an infatuated russell
 had considered marrying a blackfoot maiden and settling down in alberta cameron also enlisted russell to illustrate his personal narrative
 of the ‘ big bear troubles of 1885 russell obliged with six pen and ink drawings but they were not
 used when cameron s book finally appeared in 1926 in depicting a more northern country than he had seen at

 spring 2004 they are a fine outfit those blackfeet frederic remington in western canada peter h hassrick frederic remington came
 early in life to be regarded as the leading figure in american art to explore western subjects it was without
 question observed the critic william coffin in 1892 only six years after remington began his art career that people have
 formed their conceptions of what the far western life is like more from what they have seen in mr remington
 s pictures than from any other source in his view canada s frontier region as an integral part of that
 far western life provided compelling subjects for his art in every medium that remington explored watercolour pen and ink oil
 and bronze western canada found expression its people and landscape engaged his creative force and served as his muse throughout
 his life peter h hassrick is founding director emeritus of the charles for remington canada was not just some remote
 destination nor a slightly exotic m russell center for the study neighbour to the north for him canada represented a
 core locus within his world a of art of the american west at place that while physically distant from his
 doorstep during most of his life was the university of oklahoma nonetheless central to his experiential aspirations his artistic vision
 and his basic he was curator of art at the definition of north america amon carter museum fort western canada
 provided a particularly compelling focus for his work during the worth texas 1969 75 director early years of his career
 he made two special trips to alberta and saskatchewan one of the buffalo bill historical in 1887 and another in
 1890 that brief exposure made a lasting impression on the center cody wyoming 1976 96 artist confirming his belief that
 the frontier west traversed international borders he and founding director of was convinced as a result of his visits that
 the blackfoot indians were a remarkable the georgia o keeffe museum people excelling all northern plains tribes in physical beauty
 and historical legacy in santa fe new mexico also that the north west mounted police beyond their colourful demeanor and
 he has written or co authored valorous record represented a fundamental frontier i nartial order that especially four major books
 on remington resonated with remington s political and social perspectives and russell including the monumental two volume canada s appeal
 for remington began as a close and affectionate childhood memory frederic remington a he grew up in upstate new york
 and during much of that time canada was in view catalogue raisonné 0:raisonne directly across the st lawrence river his father
 seth pierre remington served for many years during the decade of the i 870 s as collector of revenue for
 the port of ogdensburg at the time the largest canadian u s port of entry as a young man frederic
 was a robust outdoorsman who hunted and fished in the woods of eastern canada and later in middle age he
 sought the quiet shores of canadian lakes in southwestern quebec as subjects for his art for example evening on a
 canadian lake 1905 william koch collection palm beach and as personal alberta history spring 2004 retreats from the pressures of
 professional life he also owned an island ingleneuk on the st lawrence river for the last nine years of his
 life there he painted many of his major canvases including some like radisson and groseilliers 1906 buffalo bill historical center
 cody that paid tribute to the early canadian explorers and founders of the hudson s bay company when remington was
 not painting at ingleneuk he would be found plying the broad st lawrence in his ruxton canoe many of his
 most enjoyable hours were thus spent paddling the waters that separated yet bound the two countries canada then was as
 familiar as his home and as much a part of his life as any section of his own country and
 his connections with its western reaches particularly alberta and saskatchewan were especially cherished for it was there that he gained
 some of his first successes as an illustrator and painter e from the very beginning of remington s artistic journey
 he focussed on the american west a region that was a place of self discovery for him personally a place
 where he could prove his mettle against formidable odds presented by raw nature it was according to the doctrine of
 manifest destiny that was firmly in place during remington s lifetime a dangerous and rather desolate place that could in
 the artist s fig 30 mind and that of the public be tamed through the process of civilization and it
 was crowfoot head chief of the for hii n a region of international rather than merely national scope thus his
 first blackfoot was photographed by formal art assignment a trip to the southwest to report on the geronirno campaign in
 alex ross about 1887 1886 included a foray into mexico as far south as hermosillo the war with the glenbow
 archives na 1494 2 apaches was one that crossed national boundaries and had implications and for the artist appeal well
 beyond the dusty confines of arizona territory he also insisted as an artist correspondent on riding side by side with
 the cavalry and he revealed in the early illustrations for the harper s commission a proclivity for martial subjects and
 a genuine though at first rather perverse interest in native peoples indians were for him in these initial encounters representative
 of a pervasive malevolent element he perceived them as impeding the spread of civilization and felt as did many of
 his generation that they needed to be controlled by force remington s father had served with distinction in the american
 civil war and from childhood frederic had revelled in things military in remington s later years he reminisced about his
 earliest trip west a summer s jaunt to montana in 1881 and recalled observing that the frontier was rapidly closing
 i knew the wild riders and the vacant land were about to vanish forever he wrote without knowing exactly how
 to do it i began to try to record some facts around me ‘ and the more i looked the
 more the panorama unfolded 7 that panorama at least in the initial decade or more of his career was peopled
 with military figures who served 4 4 the cause of taming the very region he later lamented for losing its
 wildness the indian in that scenario was a worthy and resolute foe in the spring of 1887 remington visited western
 canada for the first time this was i 1 1 his second major assignment for harper s in his artist
 correspondent capacity he i ij 11 ‘ stopped on the way at the crow agency in montana where there had
 been recent tt 1 reports of indian unrest he then moved north into alberta to make observations ‘ k p
 a among the blackfoot along the bow river and to study the north west mounted ii police the blackfoot were
 especially inviting subjects because of their role as one of i ri ‘ the dominant forces in northern plains history

 vignettes remington provided a pictorial account of i blackfoot life and personal adornment 5 such composite drawings were a common
 means of expression for the artist in the late i 880 s he would frequently compose sets of individual observations
 into one pleasing pictorial collection in order to provide a feeling for the whole at the centre of this composition
 was a portrait of the blackfoot head chief crowfoot who remington had met at the time it was a straightforward
 portrayal devoid of glorification or stoic characterization yet in an understated way crowfoot s exalted ‘ i uit stature showed
 through tribal life revolved around him and his contemplative expression mirrored the thoughtful leadership he had provided his people during
 ta extremely difficult times remington would have agreed with his close friend julian ralph who had met crowfoot in these
 years and looked upon him as a splendid man fig 32 kingly in every respect he looked like portraits of
 julius caesar 6 remington owned frederic remington a photograph of crowfoot by alexander ross of calgary il fig 301 that

 illustrate an 1891 of remington s drawing were items that he had purchased in the canadian west that edition of
 longfellow s spring they became part of a burgeoning studio collection that the artist was hiawatha assembling and that served
 as costumes for his models over many years these items were gathered not with any ethnographic interest in mind but
 simply as studio adornments and artistic props he used them rather indiscriminately to clothe indians of a wide variety of
 tribal identifications most of these items for example appeared as beautiful vignette drawings 1131 to 331 in an 1890 edition
 of longfellow s the song of hiawatha that remington was commissioned to illustrate the artist s sense that alberta history
 spring 2004 the blackfoot represented a quintessential indian type as he called frontier groups of all sorts allowed him to
 use them and the artifacts he collected from them as templates over which he could conceptualize his artistic notion of
 indian ness in general when remington visited the blackfoot in 1887 they were being encouraged by their indian agent to
 plant and maintain gardens and whenever possible to take up farming crowfoot himself worked a garden plot remington did not
 record the ‘ ie transformation that was being wrought on these people he chose instead to portray them as warriors
 and nomadic hunters harper s weekly referred to the blackfoot as the apaches of the past remarking on their legendary
 bellicosity their warlike a i 0 tr character and their independent manner 7 remington s attraction to the blackfoot was
 dependent in large part on the warrior ethos that permeated their culture and parallelled his own penchant for military activity
 it was these qualities of the blackfoot people that most intrigued him not the painful realities of the reservation acculturation
 process that were everywhere in evidence remington s painting a blackfoot indian plate 101 pictured a resolute and independent horseman
 posed proudly before his village of tipis remington s was a selective vision fig 33 remington also had come to

 to be fearless and firm yet fair edition of longfellow s hiawatha as a tribute to the mounted police remington
 produced a variety of spirited depictions he painted potent oil portraits of them such as canadian mounted policeman regina barracks
 and cavalryman he presented their training exercises and public demonstrations of equestrian synchrony as in the i nanoeuvres illustrated in
 harper s weekly with the title of the c anadian mounted police on a musical ride charge fig 34 here
 the lancers carrying imported bamboo lances and with their mexican saddles and fiery bronchos presented a very strange spectacle 8
 it was as harper s noted an amusement as well as a serious test of skill the brass band strikes
 up a lively air the audience gather round indians travelers policeman all the population of the frontier post and then
 the ride begins first at a walk then at a trot finally at a gallop they cross and recross grand
 chain all the figures of the well known dance as far as they can be adapted for quadruped performers the
 grand last act is a charge with lances leveled in long long row delivered with a vim that made our
 special artist who from the vantage ground of a soap box was sketching the scene feel his point of observation
 decidedly insecure remington employed this pictorial sweep in many of his later compositions he had learned it irom french nineteenth
 century academic military painters such as edouard detaille it provided the basic compositional format for the most ambitious paintings of
 rcmingtons career right front into line come on of 1891 as one of several rhetorical stratagems invented by remington to
 demonstrate the valour and tenacity of the mounted police the artist also painted a watercolour arrest of a blackfeet murderer
 fig 35 after his return to his studio in brooklyn it showed no less that six mounted police bringing an
 accused blackfoot to justice perhaps a scene remington had witnessed it also reflected a sense of fatalism and resigned hopelessness
 with the indian s uplifted hand and what harper s referred to as a thtoical look on his face 9

 chief support of indians of this type their food has been slaughtered mercilessly by the arms of precision invented by
 the whites and the blackfeet unwilling and in most cases unable to settle down as farmers and citizens owing to
 their inherited nature and the absence of those traits which permit white men to thrive in regions swept bare of
 game are forced to plunder or to starve there was also a not so subtle racist implication to harper s
 words the editors and the vast majority of their anglo american readers presumed that indians were psychologically intellectually and culturally
 incapable of sustaining themselves by means of agriculture remington shared that view beyond the expressions of bias and moral conscience
 remington s painting also represented a new direction he was taking as an artist he wished to win approbation in
 formal academic circles in addition to his growtng acceptance and populaiity as an illustrator as the art critic george sheldon
 noted of a laige oil painting rctumn of a blackfoot war party 1887 anschutz collection denver plate 13 his splendid
 reputation as an illustratoi for the magazine has failed to satisfy the ambition of an artist who bids fair to
 become equally established as a professional painter over the next several years remington returned time and again to subjects related
 to his western canadian adventure of 1887 moreover he continued to explore pictorial metaphors of loss transformation and cultural dissolution
 his canvas conjuring back the bufftilo plate 12 connotes pathos 2 and given the fact that it is not a
 known native ceremony reveals the theatrical invention that remington brought to many of his canvases the bleached bison skulls and
 the golden light evoke a sense of passing its inscription though bow river can far north west suggests empirical observation
 and helped persuade the artist s audience to think that it was both compassionate in sentiment and factually current in
 time lt spoke to an issue of the day as articulated by the naturalist william hornaday in his smithsonian article

 one step further though in addressing the cultural tragedy as well so while his view of indians had not changed

 inveterate resisters of civilization to him his work also hinted at a certain depth of social understanding and empathy as
 a romantic realist remington fashioned art that was rooted in fact enshrouded with the exotic shaped by narrative and infused
 with historical poignancy his canvases although elaborate pictorial structures were simple straightforward messages devoid of piety in his journal for
 1889 he entered a quote from colonial historian samuel penhallow let it suffice in praise of the narrative if facts
 related be true and exact and the style be familiar plain and easy as all historical matter should be written
 3 such narrative foundations can be seen in remington s drawing of 1887 canadian backwoods architecture fig 36 that spoke
 subtly to the notion of progress and was equated by harper s weekly with the united states frontier beginning with
 the central motif a decorated blackfoot dwelling there follows the trading post the ranch house and the farm buildings of
 succeeding stages of pioneering the barracks of their mounted police corresponding to those of our cavalry and then the construction
 camp of railroad builders followed if not accompanied by the first ‘ store the ‘ nucleus of a city and
 the cradle of a ‘ boom in city lots 4 a similar suggestion of progression may be read into one
 of remington s most accomplished paintings of the period the indian trapper plate 161 the narrative is true a trapper
 adorned with articles remington had collected in canada has halted on his way up a rocky trail in the selkirk
 mountains as penhallow had required the style is plain the figure clearly dominates the scene and is presented with bold
 colours and clarity of drawing that reveal the artist s debt to the french academic tradition yet the gesture and
 mood are elegiac the trapper looks back over his shoulder as if in remembrance his spavin horse and the uphill
 trail leading to an unseen divide suggest a passing era in 1890 remington returned to western canada travelling across the
 dominion on the canadian pacific railway this time with his wife and a friend the writer julian ralph alberta history

 2004 remington revisited western canadian themes many times in later years although he never returned to the region itself for
 a lengthy article on the northwest mounted police of canada written by canadian engineer j g a creighton in 1893
 remington provided no less than nine illustrations winter costume ofthe police fig 431 as a pen and ink wash drawing
 is a virtuoso exercise in facility of line his skill as a draftsman had become so accomplished that he was
 able to render complicated textural nuances with great ease this was one of an increasing number of military costume studies
 that he made during the period six of his nine illustrations for the creighton article comprised pictorial treatments of military
 uniforms for remington the fine points of martial attire across the western world provided a consuming fascination for him military
 uniforms repiesented metaphorical manifestations of power his paintings of men wearing those uniforms in action such as arrest of a
 blackfeet murderer fig 35 portrayed the result of that manifested power while remington s work often reflected lessons indirectly taken
 from european and fellow american artists he had unknown to him a disciple of his own that was the montana
 painter charles m russell many of remington s illustrations and paintings presaged russell s work in a similar vein for
 example in the lodges of the blackfeet fig 29 of 1887 by remington very likely inspired russell s western montage
 a painting of blackfoot life that illustrated his first book studies of western life published in 1890 likewise creighton s
 story provided an example within the article appeared a remington illustration of three mounted policeman confronting huge odds in attaining
 the surrender of a blackfoot cattle thief bull elk from crowfoot s camp fig 45 it may have served to
 inspire some of russell s acclaimed mountie paintings like single handed fig 6 remington s illustration daring arrest qf bull
 elk attempted rescue by a mob of blackfeet fig 45 the original painting is now lost shows a sergeant howe
 and two constables calling for bull elk s capitulation their resolute valor and the proclaimed virtue of their cause carried

 a ‘ 0 alberta history spring 2004 alberta history spring 2004 0 in 1895 the artist was invited to illustrate
 a lengthy serial article in harper s month v by the magazine editor and outdoors aficionado caspar w whitney the
 author was working at the time as sports editor for harper s weekly and had just returned from a winter
 expedition into the wilds north of edmonton remington was asked to help sustain the narrative with a group of more
 spirited works he and whitney had been long time friends remington set the stage for the whitney trip with an
 ambitious illustration trading iii the hudson bay company s u old store at edmonton fig 46 an interior view picturing
 an array of colourful characters gathered around a wood stove natives mounted police mushers and trappers peopled the scene and
 introduced the types of characters that would be met along the way north the picture was reminiscent of one he
 had painted for haiper s weekly after his 1887 trip to western canada sketch in a hudson bay company trading
 store fig 47 the figures in the 1895 work are less suggestive of caricatures resulting from criticisms that had been
 levelled at remington s interpretation of indians as savages in the late i 880 s for other works in this
 hefty commission remington very likely used photographs supplied by whitney or others in the troop sour grapes fig 48 and
 the rabbit hu it fig 49 give the sense of having been derived from such sources in these paintings he
 used a photographic perspective with the horizon line at eye level his compositions too appear to have a snapshot qttality
 rather than being creatively constructed by the time he painted his vibrant wash drawing stiow indian or the nort m

 resonates with life here an alert blackfoot man cloaked in an emblematic hudson s bay capote and topped with a
 feathered fur hat rides a spirited prancing horse across an empty picture plane early in the new century remington expanded
 on the theme of the canadian west being a natural extension of the american west in 1902 the editors of
 scribner s magazine called on him to pi oduce four paintings in colour celebrating characteristic romanticized figures from western frontier
 history these were to be reproduced in colour in the magazines remington chose a cavalry soldier on night griard a
 cowboy running horses out of the hills a frontier scout astride a handsome pinto pony and a canadian trapper which
 he titled the half breed his caption connected united states western history with the canadian frontier epoch that was quickly
 closing it recalled a time less than two decade earlier when he had first been attracted to canada as described
 by remington in the rather harshly ethnocentric bias of his times the ha t b reed was one of the
 relics of the old fur company days the descendant of white employees and indian squaws in great numbers the half
 breeds led a nomad existence on the plains of the northwest and at one time bid fair to become a
 separate and peculiar people our government through the army deported large bands from the then territory of montana to canada
 and their expiring effort was the louis riel rebellion the passing of the buffalo left them stranded and their predatory
 habits made their suppression necessary but they still exist though robbed of their picturesque appai el and characteristic traits with
 magazines like scribner s and collier s freeing remington to paint in colour and to invent subjects that were not
 dependent on story lines provided by other authors he was challenged to effect stylistic changes in his art critics began
 to recognize the new 0 alberta history spring 2004 alberta history spring 2004 0 alberta history spring 2004 approach that
 remington was excited to be taking according to the new york evening mail reviewing an exhibition of remington s recent
 paintings at the noé 0:noe art galleries in 1903 frederick sic remington comes nearer to telling his facts of frontier life
 in pictorial terms in his current exhibition at the noé 0:noe galleries than on any occasion of recent years where these
 new pictures gain over previous efforts is in their deliberate seeking for atmosphere his colors are correspondingly subdued and the
 effect is decidedly fortunate 2 the success of the half breed and its companion works may also have motivated remington
 to consider the trapper as a subject for one of his bronzes in the summer of 1903 he copyrighted his
 famous sculpture the mountain man plate 15 he described the piece as an old iriquois sic trapper who followed the
 fur companies in the rocky mountains in the 30 40 ties the connection with his illustrations of canadian subjects is
 compelling remington achieved remarkable success with his bronzes in his lifetime he sold over 150 of his spirited broncho buster
 first cast in 1895 his mountain man over the five year period remaining to him went to fifteen collectors the
 multiformity of his creative output paintings drawings watercolours pastels bronzes not to mention his prolific writings was astounding but what
 most set him apart from others in the field according to a new york times review of his 1904 noé 0:noe
 art galleries show was thematic versatility that remington so enthusiastically chose canadian subjects for his work along with those of
 mexico germany russia and other even more distant parts of the world manifests a muse that was as far flung
 as a turn of the century creative vision might be expected to reach by 1909 the last year of remington
 s life he had crossed another threshold of expectation as he had hoped to do at the beginning of his
 career remington had finally achieved recognition as a painter of great versatility and merit he had escaped the limiting parameters
 of illustrative art and had begun to earn acclaim as a painter s painter his brushwork had bi oadened his
 atmosphei e softened his colours achieved more harmony and the elements of mood emotional connectivity and theme had coalesced as
 a critic wrote for the craftsman magazine early that year he is achieving a manner that has been evolved out
 of the subjects which he paints so that his color is more and more inevitably related to his ideas as
 if nature herself had spread his palette he has grown to think freely and fluently 2 he was credited in
 fact with creating a whole set of new conditions in american art those conditions included his combination of modern techniques
 of painting and an unabashed allegiance to narrative i am working for big effects he told a reporter from the
 new york herald and those came only for him with the combination of powerful pictorial and thematic expression 2 remington
 began and ended his career using canadian frontier subjects his penchant for international themes his affection for canada its people
 and its history and his willingness to accommodate an artistic vision that included with equal measure native and non native
 cultures gave his expression depth breadth and vitality that few other artists of his generation enjoyed for remington western canada
 was perceived as one part of a larger north american frontier experience alberta history spring 2004 0 alberta history spring
