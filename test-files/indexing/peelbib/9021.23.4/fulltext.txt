 fort mcmurray and inconspicuous in fort mcmurray s history is the author of two books meeting of but he has
 become an enigmatic abstract many waters 1973 and ribbon of steamboats north 1975 above is a shadow lending merely his

 his direction moted to chief factor and stayed in that the book remains one of the few public district until
 1867 when he was transferred writings available that tells a direct tale to fort chipewyan at lake athabasca wilof fort

 son and lies buried in historical archives in letters after her death to harriet lnkster a sister in private collections
 and a lesser subject of sheriff inkster the couple had three in detailed works on the fur trade a large
 children a son who died a bachelor and part has remained unrecorded and will never two daughters who married this
 second be known marriage took place in 1868 after which in contrast to moberly william mcmur the newly married couple
 went north where ray was a relatively quiet secure man not mcmurray was shortly to become involved only was he
 the fur trade factor in charge in the problems of the athabasca district of the athabasca district in 1 870
 but he by the time he arrived at fort chipewas the man who persuaded moberly to wyan to take charge
 of the district mcjoin the h b co s service as a clerk in murray was a well known figure
 throughorder to carry out mcmurray s plan to out the north men spoke of his ability to build a new
 post at the forks of the atha adapt to the harsh cold of the winters and basca and clearwater rivers
 moberly re wrote of him as one of the best winter fers several times in his book to the factor
 travellers of his time he was apparently at fort chipewyan but fails to make clear so fluent with the native
 languages that that it was william mcmurray a short he had been urged to produce a chipewyan time later mcmurray
 succeeded to even dictionary and a book of grammar and greater eminence becoming one of the four phrases he was
 also a crack shot inspecting chief factors a position second some of mcmurray s letters which have in the fur
 trade field only to that of chief survived deal not only with fur trade affairs commissioner and in all likelihood
 had but show he was interested in politics the it not been for his sudden and untimely negotiations for land
 claims with canada death he would have gone on to even great the advances of transportation and all the er
 fame in the fur trade stirrings of progress of that day and age william mcmurray was born in the one
 letter in particular was penned by the north west on march 4 1824 one of at chief trader when the
 trade proceedings least two sons of chief trader thomas had excited a lively interest among the mcmurray who was a
 member of the fani fur trade officers ous beaver club of montreal thomas mc canada would appear to be in
 deadly earnest with regard to the railroad murray had been a partner in the north and my own opinion is
 that sir george west company and when it amalgamated simpson will not set any very formid with the h b
 co he was elevated to a able obstacles in the path of the pro chief trader retiring in 1843 and
 dying moters of the scheme personally i do not believe it to be as fantastic as many in upper canada
 six years later in the service hold you will be inter like his father young william joined ested to know
 that sir george was put upon the rack for days at a time and the h b co service and
 at 18 years of on the whole came out with flying age he was muffled to the eyebrows in the
 colours it was extremely awkward that harsh cold of great slave lake it was mr roebuck and the others should
 concustomary to send new recruits to the vast front him with passages from his own book concerning the fertility of
 the districts of athabasca peace and macken country and the practicability of a boat brigades to fort chipewyan the cennorthern

 labors had tral receiving and delivering depot for the given it a rather despised reputation not only for those who
 worked on the brigades but for the fur trade officers whose very livelihood depended on receiving the crucial supplies and
 on turning a profit as the years went by the antiquated trail to the north was crumbling under the strain
 freight loads were increasing to an enormous amount of tonnage supplies were lost abandoned went missing or simply did not
 arrive the labor force was disappearing and somewhat lacking in enthusiasm as higher wages were paid elsewhere and new opportunities
 arose for employment at a time when the h b co was finally losing its monopoly charter to the fur
 trade in rupert s land it was forced william mcmurray to assess one of its highest costs its transportation system
 it had to abandon northwesterly route which he was ob the impracticable routes and improve the liged with changed opinions
 to disavow mclaughlin writes that this caused a workable necessary arteries the subject good deal of amusement in committee of
 portage ha loche became first and forebut sir george stuck to his guns he most was particularly interested in all
 that passed with regard to cultivation they during the discussion of alternate routes even brought up a statement of old
 sir william mcmurray advocated a fort at the alexander mackenzie s that he saw in the elk river a kitchen
 garden as fine junction of the athabasca and clearwater as any in the world rivers there it would serve the
 natives did you see what chief justice draper in the region who were considered among told the committee that they
 might the best hunters in the district but its main laugh at him as visionary but he hoped function would
 be as a guard station it to see the time or believed his children would live to see it when
 there would lay at the entrance to the peace athabasca be a railway going all across the coun and mackenzie
 districts on the very pulse try and ending at the pacific he said of the fur trade and sat conveniently
 on he entertained no doubts whatever of the junction of two rivers the only feasit i am told that this
 fantasy occasioned much merriment especially on the ible means of reaching the northern posts part of the old rear but

 rejoin the h b co and to accept intrusion by men who in on a permanent basis men like moberly

 when next morning peter went to work with a call came for men to work with an extra six other
 men and the foreman he was gang peter was one of the first to sign not about to take a
 chance on being laid up the work was on a railroad under off again so he applied himself with such
 construction in northern ontario heading zeal that the foreman was prompted to north and east from timmins towards the slow
 him down quebec border the men were promised peter do you want to kill yourself 25 cents an hour i

 you ll find there s plenty of being pushed through a wild and isolated work in canada you ll never
 get it all region hundreds of miles away from any clone by yourself no matter how hard you civilization there
 was plenty of work and try a lot of opportunity for overtime so peter work on the railroad lasted all
 summer took advantage of it and worked after hours and in to the fall the men worked 6 days and
 on sundays at the end of the first a week 1 0 hours a day and were paid 1 7
 month the men wondered why they were cents an hour when winter came the com not paid still the camp
 life was good and pany laid off the two extra men they had plenty to cat they began to re

 lack of pay still there taylorton saskatchewan he took the train was nothing much they could do about it to
 bienfait and from there continued on there was no one to speak for them or foot to taylorton on his
 arrival he disto tell them what was happening a rumour covered there was no accommodation outcropped up saying they would
 be paid on side of a few company houses the remaindcompletion of the job the men still grum er were
 small sod shacks put up by the bled but decided that having stuck it out miners themselves for that long
 they might as well stay to in a conversation with one of his countrythe end men he was told he
 would be welcome the woi k finished with spring breakup to stay with them nick gimbey s house when camp
 was dismantled the men were had one bedroom and a small kitchen in advised that the contractor had gone bank

 mine a few days after returning to winnipeg work was ten hours a day at 2 25 a peter signed
 up as section hand for a job day contract work was forty cents a ton near lake ontario arriving at
 the camp there were few rules and no regular hours he quit when he found the men were sup men

 put in their ten hours of work the lake he did not like fish and could the miners lived a
 quiet life outside of not work on an empty stomach to save work and sleep there was little else to
 do on fare back to winnipeg he hopped a once in a while the young men would train carrying extra
 men for another job walk the 1 8 miles to estevan visit and talk when time came for him to
 go his way for a few hours then walk back home he was warned by the foreman that if he
 again peter once more had time to read tried to leave the extra gang he would he subscribed to the
 kanadevski rusyn be arrested but remembering his last cx but found little of interest in the paper perience on an
 extra gang he ignored later he came across another periodical the threat and jumped the train at the next rohochev
 narod the working people opportune moment he then hid until he and found it more to his liking in it
 he was certain he would not be pursued by read of workers and their problems in difthe train crew ferent
 industries as well as news of world peter s next job was at st boniface in happenings both national and
 international a stone quarry a month later he was laid it opened his eyes to the world around him off

 that he did not ing peter spoke about the mine from mean to make trouble he tried to say that
 a news item in the robochey narod he peter was a good man who cared about had learned that the
 wages in cardiff people but in his excitement he broke into alberta were 3 25 for an eight hour day

 it was attended by a large crowd of music and discussions he loved to read miners and their wives at
 this meeting both books and periodicals he was always peter was elected as secretary of the branch interested in what

 a certain store there in which the winnipeg merchant is interested the keeper of the store had just received from
 the city six dozens of bottles of fruit syrup as he supposed the retail price was 1 50 per bottle
 the visitor bought a bottle and on taking it home was delighted to fimid that it contained brandy instead of
 fruit syrup he told a friend about it on the dead quiet the friend called on the shop keeper and
 purchased a bottle which however was found to contain fruit syrup a third party was told and the bottle purchased
 by him was discovered to be filled with dark brandy the three concluded that a mistake had been made somewhere
 and felt pretty well satisfied that the shop keeper was not into the secret they decided to take chances and
 bought out the full six dozen bottles at 1 50 per bottle they found that two dozen contained dark brandy
 these they sold at 5 per bottle with the exception of a bottle or so that they had for private
 use a day later the shop keeper was the sickest man at medicine hat he had just got a letter
 from his winnipeg partner telling him that he had sent two dozens of brandy with the shipment of fruit syrup
