 deployment to afghanistan although a success based on all metrics saw more of our finest fall in combat from the 
 start of the mission in the fall of 2009 the return of the first battalion from afghanistan only marked the 
 beginning of preparations for the third battalion based deployment which will be in its final stages of readiness by the 
 time you read these comments the regiment continues to answer the call to duty with the same determination and zeal 
 demonstrated by the originals when hamilton gault founded the ppcli in 1914 from the fall of 2009 to spring 2010 
 all three units had a significant number of soldiers deployed to afghanistan the first battalion completed its second tour of 
 afghanistan in 2010 after conducting partnered operations with kandak2 living amongst the afghan population and working closely with our nato 
 allies the second battalion deployed a composite company a company to the kandahar provincial reconstruction team kprt and from the

 training cycle behind the scenes throughout all this were the trainers administrators and countless volunteers without whom the machine does 
 not function patricias in schools and training centres from wainwright to gagetown continued to produce excellent soldiers and leaders the 
 staff at regimental headquarters unit rear parties and association members and volunteers across the country comforted our families and looked 
 after the needs of our veterans your quiet professionalism and compassion lift the spirit of all those you touch and 
 exemplify the true value of the regimental family during challenging times whether in operations overseas or at home the regiment 
 continues to uphold the tradition of excellence on 29 november 2010 the governor general presented the first battalion with the 
 commander in chief s unit commendation for its service as the task force orion battle group on op archer in

 7 in message from colonel of the regiment 2010 has been another stalwart year for the regiment from combat operations 
 in afghanistan to security duties during the olympics in vancouver i was extremely proud and honoured to have been appointed 
 colonel of the regiment in may during a ceremony in shilo hosted by the second battalion the soldiers performed magnificently 
 despite very little time for preparation in june i attended the change of command parade of first battalion recently returned 
 from operational duty in afghanistan lcol walsh handed over command to lcol fletcher in august i had the opportunity to 
 visit first and third battalions with the colonel in chief accompanied by her husband john ralston saul it was wonderful 
 to be able to share a few relaxing days with the soldiers and attend the french grey ball hosted by 
 3 ppcli i had the opportunity in october to present don cherry his honorary patricia scroll on hockey night in 
 canada in november i attended the rededication ceremony of the hall of honour in our museum in calgary where the 
 regiment paid tribute to the 12 patricias who gave their lives in service to canada 2009 to 2010 many family 
 members of the fallen attended this moving and emotional ceremony and all paid tribute to the manner in which the 
 regiment had assisted them under difficult conditions many expressed their appreciation for the manner in which their sons husbands and 
 fathers were honoured in perpetuity in the hall of honour the highlight of the fall was the vimy dinner in 
 ottawa over 40 patricias attended the annual conference of defence associations event to honour our colonel in chief as the 
 recipient of the 2010 vimy award for her outstanding contribution to the defence and security of canada and for her 
 promotion and preservation of canadian democratic values this was a very proud and special event in the history of our 
 regiment in late november the first battalion received the unit commendation from the governor general for the unit s outstanding 
 accomplishments in afghanistan as task force 1 06 despite short notice the battalion and members of the task force performed 
 admirably in december i had the pleasure of attending the second battalion s christmas dinner and annual at home and 
 was very pleased to see the tremendous esprit that abounds in the unit plans for the 100 th anniversary have 
 advanced rapidly this year and much progress has been made in finalizing the plans to commemorate 100 years of service 
 to canada the centennial is focused around three major commemorations edmonton 7 to 10 august 2014 ottawa 18 to 21 
 september 2014 and frezenberg belgium 5 to 8 may 2015 all those involved in developing the plans including the regimental 
 association are to be commended for their outstanding efforts as we move toward celebrating our centennial the regiment also took 
 a huge step forward by establishing a charitable foundation with a view to secure the regiment s financial future and 
 to perpetuate the well being of the regiment in many ways this will put the regiment on a solid financial 
 footing well into the future and will benefit all members of the regiment and their families much remains to be 
 done in this regard but the efforts of the trust working group and now the foundation board have been nothing 
 short of spectacular in getting this much needed initiative to fruition i very much look forward to visiting the units 
 as they continue their preparations for operations and undergo unique and exciting training to take on new challenges i am 
 fully confident that the regiment will continue to meet these challenges as they have in the past good luck and 
 good soldiering to all lieutenant general rr crabbe cmm msc cd ret d colonel of the regiment 
 8 message from the regimental major with the changing of the calendar to 2011 i mentally ticked off one year 
 down and three to go i am not trying to conjure parallels between a prison sentence and the rms job 
 but just noting how quickly the regiment s centennial is approaching with so much still to do to properly prepare 
 for this momentous occasion in this issue you can read more about the centennial projects in the final planning stages 
 and a few that we have committed to already given the tight timeline the regimental executive committee approved two major 
 projects that will allow us to reflect upon our great military heritage and share the same with our fellow canadians 
 the museum improvement project and the development and production of a book to commemorate the regiment s centennial in addition 
 to the regular submissions from major contributors you will find articles on the recent changes to the voluntary monthly contributions 
 and the constitution and by laws to properly look after the needs of our soldiers especially our wounded warriors and 
 the next of kin of our fallen we had to re think our financial policies the soldier must feel that 
 he is part of a living tradition and that all who serve with him and have served before are at 
 his or her side if the regiment is to step up and provide service to our soldiers when formal avenues 
 of assistance have been exhausted we need financial depth that can only be secured through the generosity of patricias and 
 their fellow canadians to communicate the on going needs of the regiment i will use the chain of command the 
 regiment s website ppcli com the regimental manual and our face book site as appropriate to engage our fellow canadians 
 the regiment has turned to the newly created ppcli foundation you can find out more about the ppcli foundation in 
 the article by mgen ret d barry ashton the review of our policies and procedures for the care of our 
 soldiers and their families is timely as this edition of the patrician goes to print 3 ppcli and b company 
 from 1 ppcli will be in the final preparations for deployment to afghanistan our thoughts go back to previous missions 
 that demanded so many sacrifices from our soldiers and their families as these patricias say farewell and focus on the 
 tasks that await them in afghanistan they can do so with the confidence that the remainder of the regimental family 
 stands ready to assist them and their families no matter what before i let you get on with the rest 
 of the patrician i would like to thank all contributors for their quick reaction to tight deadlines without your commitment 
 it would not be possible to publish this very important document in a timely manner in particular i wish to 
 acknowledge the regimental headquarters staff for their diligent efforts long days and on occasion weekends lost to meet the needs 
 of the regiment i for one am extremely grateful and honoured to be deserving of such dedication major h j

 operating base masum ghar and focus on bazaar e panjwayi 1 pi remained in patrol base mohajerin to oversee its 
 closure while maintaining control of the villages of mohajerin and salavat 2 pi established an austere patrol base in the 
 village of chalghowr to disrupt insurgent lines of communication as the village had been identified as an increasingly important supply 
 route for improvised explosive device led components flowing into kandahar city this importance was confirmed by a substantial increase in 
 direct fire engagements notably pkm and rpg fire was received shortly after establishing the patrol base we conducted daily section 
 and platoon sized patrols throughout the coy ao and executed a number of deliberate clearance operations in conjunction with our 
 partnered ana most notably we participated in the ana led clearance of bazaar e panjwayi a village of approximately 5000 
 inhabitants located on the southern edge of the arghandab from late april to early may a coy completed its handover

 as maj wade rutland and mwo ray brodeur handed over c coy to the incoming maj james l heureux and 
 mwo mark pickford the following months marked the coy s reconstitution phase during which time c coy acted as the 
 iru for lfwa with all kit vehicles and soldiers ready to react within 24 hours to any crisis in the 
 area coy training with the absence of lavs consisted of getting back to dismounted infantry skills with a focus on 
 winter warfare this training focused on the basics of tent rout snowshoeing and proper dismounted patrol techniques the dedicated low 
 level training paid off as 7 pi took the top platoon award during ex patricia challenge the battalion military skills 
 competition in addition to the competition c coy took part in the battalion s computer simulated cp exercise ex patricia 
 powerslave during ex patricia powerslave many excellent lessons were learned regarding radio procedure and working with the supporting arms the 
 year finished with c coy preparing to train those soldiers deploying with the mttf and op attention combat support company 
 combat support company has had an eventful year both abroad and within canada unique from the remainder of the bn 
 the events of the coy have been divided by platoon organization signals platoon for signals platoon the year started literally 
 with a bang finding the platoon in the heat of battle during tf 3 09 with platoon members deployed across 
 the ao operating the bg cp and the two austere bg rrbs keeping in contact and administrating the platoon was 
 an amazing feat of coordination and timings although they were not exactly in the season of merriment and happiness their 
 excitement continued to grow as redeployment dates approached having the platoon completely redeployed by mid may the focus turned to 
 leave time with family and postings saying good bye to members of the platoon is never easy but after living 
 day in and day out with these members a good bye never seems to say enough once back from post 
 deployment leave the platoon was hard at work again supporting pcf basic and advanced comms courses in addition to bn 
 signals platoon duties during various mil skills competitions as well as a cax while most of the platoon is remaining 
 in edmonton we have had to say good bye to a few friends who were posted and sent away for 
 mttf hq tasks recce platoon after returning from an eventful tour under demanding circumstances the skilled soldiers of recce platoon 
 returned to new companies to make way for the young privates and corporals eager to prove their mettle and fortitude 
 now in a reconstitution phase recce platoon is drawing the most motivated and skilled soldiers in the battalion two serials 
 of basic recce patrolman courses have been completed with the next level of training on the horizon during ex iron 
 patricia recce platoon meets a sand storm while on patrol 
 36 combat support company tf 3 09 sniper section in 2010 the sniper group was extremely busy as well snipers 
 were engaged in operations with tf 3 09 until may recce platoon was employed throughout the entire bg ao during 
 tf 3 09 often far from friendly forces for extended periods of time as one of the last chalks to 
 re deploy to canada anticipation was building during their last few weeks on tour post deployment leave and summer block 
 leave were combined for the majority of recce platoon so coming back to work was a good change of pace 
 after post deployment leave they began reconstitution of their ranks by employing ojt snipers within their organization simultaneously some of 
 the members of the sniper group were course loaded on plq mods 1 6 dp 3a dp3b or supported the 
 basic recce courses in the new year the sniper group will be busy expanding development of their skills by conducting 
 a small unit exchange with the usmc sniper school which will include attending a slant angle shooting course the sniper 
 det commaner course and advanced sniper courses administration company soldiers of administration company began 2010 in afghanistan supporting battle group 
 bg operations a large portion of the soldiers supporting the a 2 echelon during any operation came from transport and 
 maintenance platoons all trades a point to note is that the majority of administration company personnel were spread out throughout 
 the bg ao in support of rifle company patrol bases during any operation whether it was combat team or bg 
 these soldiers had to be regrouped prior to form the main body of the a 2 echelon this was a 
 challenging feat in its own right the main role of the a 2 echelon was to bring combat supplies such 
 as rations water ammunition petroleum oils and lubricants recovery assets and first line support forward to where the fighting troops 
 were operating there were many busy days for the a 2 echelon continually conducting re supply runs and delivering essential 
 resources to the front lines transport platoon was able to effectively maintain forward momentum of sustained bg operations they drove 
 the incredibly versatile armoured heavy support vehicle systems ahsvs these vehicles were capable of transporting all combat supplies that lavs 
 and soldiers in the rifle companies needed on the battlefield maintenance and weapons technicians were extremely busy prior to any 
 operation ensuring all fighting vehicles were working at 100 before crossing the lod this was a 24hr day task which 
 every support person in administration company put 110 effort into to ensure success administration company worked hand in hand with 
 the afghan national police and afghan national army conducting partnered re supply operations this partnership was extremely beneficial to both 
 canadian and afghan operations using similar tactics to successfully accomplish the mission two countries that appear to be very different 
 were actually surprisingly similar in the conduct of support operations administration company personnel proved that they were the swiss army 
 knife of the bg during all operations with their wide range of skill sets and unwavering dedication to support the 
 fighting echelon when not conducting convoys vehicle recoveries or fixing vehicles on the fly the troops worked in the staging 
 areas conducted op shifts and performed security tasks these soldiers also had to deal with the never ending threat of 
 improvised explosive devices and constantly dismounted to clear wadis culverts and suspicious items always ready to react to any situation 
 
 administration company success of the tf 3 09 bg and combat team operations rifle company daily patrol routines and camp 
 improvements was an incredible mark of professionalism portrayed in part to the hard work of administration company s clerks weapons 
 technicians qm personnel mechanics transport personnel and support staff something we tend to forget when deployed are the people we 
 leave at home station to manage behind the scene everyday tasks this would include the battalion s family support center 
 staff and the rear party clerks who fall under administration company without a doubt they had a difficult job and 
 were very much appreciated by every soldier in 1 ppcli for their dedication long hours and the support they gave 
 us while we were away from home a big thankyou 0:thank 0:you goes out to everyone involved administration company hit

 2 ppcli deployed around the world and all over canada in 2010 once again we saw the princess patricia s 
 canadian light infantry as a wartime regiment this was keenly felt in a coy which formed the core of task 
 force 3 09 force protection coy with the provincial reconstruction team prt in afghanistan 2010 can be defined as a 
 very busy year full of great achievement and exhilaration but also of sacrifice it will be remembered for the great 
 things accomplished on operations both overseas and at home for the memory of our fallen and for the ceaseless and 
 untiring support of our families at home as well as the organizations that supported them at the start of the 
 year a coy had already been deployed overseas for over three months and was decidedly acclimatized to the busy urban 
 operating environment within kandahar city their primary role was in support of the whole of government partners operating in kandahar 
 province life was busy but manageable for all ranks with security operations and patrolling being the major focus a coy 
 had their fair share of yips throughout but a cherished highlight was the visit of the colonel of the regiment

 dismounted urban operations through this exercise c company achieved two main goals the first was proof of concept for a 
 proposed assistant urban operations instructor course which provided companies a sufficient integral cadre of instructors to conduct training within their 
 own means the second and most important goal was demanding mechanized fight a column of lavs move to the next 
 objective on the combat team commander s course

 this letter to explain to the world where and what the hell i am doing at the dispute resolution centre 
 drc in edmonton for the troops who know me and have not fallen off their chairs yes it s true 
 billy is at the drc a hat is the drc for me i think it is one of the most 
 secretive units in the entire canadian forces because no pne seems to know about it if you were like me 
 you would pot have the complete understanding of what goes on here tt grid 355 397 map wgs 84 or 
 lat n 53 40 long a 113 29 or the big blue building behind the canex it is all about 
 conflict there are only two types of people in this world that don t have conflict the unborn and the 
 dead if you fall between these categories you will have conflict what is the drc for me i think it 
 is one of the most secretive units in the entire canadian forces because no one seems to know about it 
 what is conflict you may ask a conflict is when two or more troops people are unable to agree on 
 a situation or subject in most cases people think that conflicts are bad however sometimes it causes change which is 
 good for all here at the edmonton drc we are not troops that go around and give out group hugs 
 heart punches maybe rather we are a group of military and civilian practitioners that can assist all members both military 
 and civilian employees with their conflict situations being the lone infantry mwo lam here to help train and promote the 
 drc there are 24 hours in a day on average most people sleep anywhere from six to eight hours and 
 go to work for eight hours each day ideally you should be going to work each day conflict free and 
 mission focused if you do have conflict in your workplace your eight hour work day is going to seem more 
 like a 16 as well morale and productivity will be low the edmonton drc runs local courses and for those 
 outside the edmonton area we do a travelling road show too the edmonton drc provides services to all regular and 
 reserve units all civilian employees cadet units and canadian rangers we also provide the same services for wainwright suffield calgary 
 whitehorse yellowknife and all other units within alberta and the territories the good news is money your unit does not 
 pay for any training or other drc services even if we have to travel all of our travel expenses are 
 covered by us td hotels etc here are some of the courses we offer resolving conflict effectively rce three day 
 course conflict management for leaders cml two day course note must have the rce course first tmst briefings troops as 
 i said before this is not a touchy feely place over my 35 years in the forces and being around 
 the block a few times now i have learned that there are many things taught here at the drc that 
 can help you at your workplace or on operations within or outside canada so don t be afraid to pop 
 in and see us there s a new gun at the edmonton dispute resolution centre 57

 59 french grey battalion it was a fun and challenging year for all the serving members if the french grey 
 battalion fgb service in the fgb is mbolized by variety adjustment and change this is true or all those who 
 serve at the infantry school on bases and hqs whether involved in the mentoring of junior leaders eicm dp3a and 
 38 and bmoq l officer dp 1 1 and 1 2 instructing advanced corps training i e arp or fulfilling 
 fentre of excellence roles patricias in gagetown must be silient it is not uncommon for our ncos and officers to 
 be instructors on two or three different courses throughout the training year the demand on these leaders is to bring 
 in some cases slightly different skill sets and approaches to this training perhaps the greatest contribution that members of the 
 fgb make to training in gagetown the home of the army is bringing a wealth of operational experience to the 
 ffljrriculum and the students the result is delivery of training that is of the highest calibre operationally relevant and fficussed 
 on professionalizing the corps another aspect of service in the fgb is change a number of patricias left the atlantic 
 area this year with most returning to service in the battalions however the last aps was also marked by a 
 larger number posted into cfb gagetown the infantry school in particular is fortunate enough to be heavily influenced by dozens 
 of fine patricias who work hard to support the various training cells soldiers ncos and officers from all three battalions 
 demonstrate daily that leadership is a team effort they work well together and with our peers from the other infantry 
 regiments to the benefit of the combat training centre and to the individual training system the fgb has also had 
 the opportunity to conduct and support a number of gatherings and celebrations this past year 17 march was celebrated with 
 a very spirited game of broom i 100 nobody remembers the score but the drinks pizza and camaraderie that followed 
 are remembered fondly for the second year in a row in the fall fgb supported the agm of the atlantic 
 branch of the ppcli association here in gagetown the opportunity to share stories photos and beers during the evening meet 
 and greet with those who served the regiment before us is something each of us cherished on the sunday morning 
 we gathered for a poignant memorial service to honour those the regiment had lost over the previous 12 months a 
 handful of fgb patricias were recognized for their hard work dedication and professionalism this year in keeping with the regiment 
 s unique style and brand of leadership fgb members worked hard to stay true to tenet four of the patricia

 drdc suffield and the counter terrorism technology centre cttc cfb suffield is home to the largest military training area in 
 canada at 2690 square kilometres or roughly half the size of pei you can easily fit wainwright shilo and gagetown 
 within the boundaries of suffield with room to spare unique to cfb suffield is the national wildlife area created in 
 2003 and dedicated to the preservation of 458 square kilometres of native habitat along the west bank of the south 
 saskatchewan river this is one of the last unbroken tracts of natural occurring prairie in existence in canada the base 
 exists to support the training area which is used primarily by batus and drdc although since the stand up of 
 cmtc in wainwright interest by canadian formations and units to train at suffield has increased dramatically adding to the complexity 
 of operations at suffield the oil and gas industry has over 12 000 wells and some 10 000 kilometres of 
 pipelines within the base property much of it sub surface so as to minimize interference with military training a small 
 but mighty cadre of military personnel are employed at the base to support these diverse activities including some patricias lcol

 the rifles forged in battle an overview of the first three yeai on the ist1 st of february 2007 the 
 rifles were formed out of a merger of the devonshire and dorset light infantry ddli with the royal gloucestershire berkshire 
 and wiltshire light infantry rgbwli the light infantry li and the royal green jackets rgj the rgj and the li 
 each contributed 2 battalions to the new regiment and the ddli and rgbwli amalgamated into one battalion just prior to 
 the creation of the rifles the regiment consists of 5 regular battalions 1 5 rifles 2 territorial army battalions 6 
 7 rifles 2 independent territorial army companies and over 100 affiliated cadet detachments the regimental strength numbers about 460 regular 
 officers 220 territorial army officers 4 500 regular riflemen 1 500 territorial army riflemen and in excess of 12 000 
 affiliated cadets army cadet force and combined cadet force the regular battalions are stationed permanently in chepstow 1 rifles on

 germany 5 rifles the frequent three to six yearly battalion moves arms plotting to different theatres in different roles are 
 a thing of the past and the battalions of the rifles now remain in their permanent home base locations and 
 deploy from there on operations the territorial army battalions are based on wyvern barracks exeter devon 6 rifles covering the 
 sw of england and brock barracks reading berkshire 7 rifles covering the home counties there are also independent companies d

 csm of c coy 3 rifles on formation day in helmand the size of the regiment and its different operational 
 roles and locations offer soldiers and officers a variety of career opportunities and places to serve unmatched by any other 
 infantry regiment in the british army in just over three years since formation all our battalions have deployed on operations 
 at least once 2 rifles have deployed three times iraq kosovo and afghanistan making the guideline gap between operational tours 
 of two years something of a hollow promise now that the turbulence of forming the regiment and the infantry reorganisation 
 has subsided we look forward to this routine becoming established in just over 3 years since formation all our battalions 
 have deployed on operations at least once co 2 rifles lt col rob thomson at the opening of the miteree

 some of the heaviest fighting of the campaign including covering the withdrawl from basra palace 2 rifles and elements of 
 3 rifles were in iraq at the time of formation in early 2007 so giving the new cap badge a 
 true baptism of fire they were relieved by 4 rifles in april 2007 who continued to defend basra palace until 
 its successful handover to the iraqi security forces in early september 2007 following this they were employed on operations in 
 the iran iraq border regions which made a welcome change from the urban fighting of basra lt c l sanders

 in 2003 as 1 li and the last to leave on handover 
 in afghanistan elements of 3 rifles saw the change of cap badge in helmand province on 1 february 2007 in 
 october 2009 the regiment began a series of back to back tours by rifles battalions beginning with 1 rifles they 
 deployed from october 2008 to april 2009 on a six month tour mentoring the afghan army in helmand as part 
 of 3 commando brigade 1 rifles had formally joined the brigade following a test exercise in belize in early 2008 
 afghanistan toe to toe with taliban winter 2008 2009 since this tour they have enjoyed a well deserved break from 
 operations during which they have started to develop and refine the water related and other skills needed in the commando 
 role they now look forward to another stint in afghanistan in early 2011 battalion headquarters and elements of 4 rifles

 concurrently 2 rifles were deployed in sangin dealing with both the pac man improvised explosive device challenge and the elections 
 as a result of not being part of the main effort they enjoyed less manpower and resources than have been 
 allocated subsequently to this testing and often deadly area of operations nevertheless they made several small steps of progress to 
 build a firm foundation for those who came later their commitment to the mission courage and fortitude in these circumstances 
 has been exemplary and has been matched by 3 rifles who with a coy 4 rifles took over from them 
 building on 2 rifles success 3 rifles significantly expanded the area denied to the taliban opened more schools and increased 
 the levels of legitimate commercial activity in the sangin bazaar and elsewhere it is to be hoped that additional us 
 troops arriving in the area will create force levels and resources which will be adequate for the task of securing 
 this area from the taliban permanently and at reduced cost to nato troops and local civilians territorial elements of the 
 regiment have also played a significant part in our iraq and afghan deployments in the form of composite companies and 
 many individual reinforcements their support has been of a very high standard and they have made their share of the 
 sacrifice in full measure the high operational tempo has forged the identity of the new regiment and brought it close 
 together through shared hardship and experience of battle hardly a patrol or convoy in all the operational theatres has returned 
 to base without having had some sort of contact or fire fight often at uncomfortably close quarters and employing every 
 weapon in the armoury including hand grenades in one incident a rifleman with great coolness returned a taliban grenade to 
 sender even when back in their bases they have been subject to intense indirect and direct fire attacks the riflemen 
 s steadiness under fire is testimony to the excellent basic and pre operational training they receive before deployment on recent 
 operations sniping has come to the fore as a skill of great utility and all battalions are placing emphasis on 
 creating a large pool of riflemen trained in the art 4 rifles sniper in basra summer 2007 since formation the 
 exploits in battle of the regiment and ndividual riflemen have been recognised with the award of 1 conspicuous gallantry crosses 
 6 distinguished service drders 13 military crosses 1 george medal and 2 queens 3allantry medals f i jnfc v fhe 
 regiment s operational experiences and achievements ogether with the casualties we have suffered and shared lave contributed to a rapid 
 building of the strong new egimental identity and a network of proud supporters this has paid dividends both in recruiting 
 and in creating a letwork of moral and practical support for the regiment in a ime of considerable stress and 
 need t the wider regimental network extends to the family friends and supporters of past and present riflemen and all 
 those iving in the areas where we are based recruit and enjoy elationships by virtue of our antecedent regiments and 
 heir associations the regiment is greatly indebted to this wider family and service charities for their moral practical and financial 
 support which sadly remains so necessary in a time of continuous operations since formation as at 1 june 2010 53 
 riflemen have been killed in action and 290 wounded including over 40 with life changing injuries 
 summer 2009 the 2 rifles battlegroup padre mark geraint jones after a service in sangin for one of our 53 
 kia to meet future demands of this casualty toll the rifles charities are running a fundraising campaign the care for 
 casualties appeal to raise 1 million in 2010 to find out more about this initiative and how to support it 
 please go to www careforcasualties org uk the regiment as a whole will enjoy a 12 month gap before they 
 return and go toe to toe with the taliban again in early 2011 this has provided a welcome respite for 
 regimental headquarters from their duties of attending repatriations and ensuring the best possible care for the next of kin of 
 our casualties in the immediate aftermath of their loss in contrast our long term involvement with the care of our 
 wounded and bereaved next of kin never ceases to manage this process we have established with charitable funding a regimental 
 casualty officer at rhq in winchester responsible for monitoring the care of our wounded and their rehabilitation this post is 
 only established and funded for an initial two year period whilst the army puts in place its own recovery capability 
 it is almost certain that it will have to continue because we will have an enduring need to keep a 
 regimental eye on all aspects of long term care for our bereaved and wounded to ensure no one is failed 
 by the system finally in spite of our operational commitments since formation members of the regiment have achieved much in 
 the fields of sport and adventure including walking unsupported to the south pole a challenge for the british super flyweight 
 boxing title and winning the queens medal for shooting at bisley once in the regular army category and twice in 
 the territorial category rhq winchester 1 june 2010 on watch the evening before handover of basra palace the motto of

 no mountain too high by mgen ret d lewis mackenzie in march of 2010 mcpl jody mitic and cpl andrew 
 knisley of the royal canadian regiment rcr participated in the opening ceremonies for the para olympic games in vancouver celebrating 
 with a drink s at a local bar later that evening they glanced at the tv and caught a few 
 minutes coverage of the 2009 targa newfoundland a five day 2 200 km high speed tarmac rally on the back 
 roads of newfoundland they speculated that if they entered the event they might be able to raise money for the 
 soldier on fund they had both been helped by the fund during their recovery from very serious combat wounds as 
 jody and andrew only had one complete leg and three good arms between the two of them in 2007 mcpl 
 mitic was a sniper on patrol in afghanistan when he stepped on a mine which removed both of his legs 
 below the knee less than two years later he completed a half marathon in 2009 while cpl knisley was on 
 patrol two artillery shells buried in a mud wall were detonated and took off his entire right leg and severely 
 damaged his right arm less than a year later he completed a five km walk for charity someone advised the 
 two soldiers that i had yet to grow up and was still racing formula cars and that in 2004 along 
 withmy co driver nigel mortimer had entered our first rally and won our category at the targa there are only 
 three targa italian for plate events in the world tasmania new zealand and newfoundland there are two divisions one for 
 the technical time distance teams at modest speed and an open division for the faster you go the higher you 
 place teams naturally race car drivers favour the latter getting up to 200kph on the narrow and windy back roads 
 of newfoundland where a braking point mistake can and has deposit a car in the atlantic jody and andrew paid 
 me a visit and based on their postamputation 0:post 0:amputation accomplishments to date i had no doubt they could race 
 in the open category or at the very least compete five minutes later i was managing the effort let s 
 face it how do you say no to a couple of truly outstanding role models even if they are rcr 
 we decided that it was too late in the year to be ready for the event in mid september there 
 were a few things we needed and they would all take time to source or complete a car prepared to 
 the toughest safety standards demanded by the rules rally computer in car communication system race driver school rally instruction certified 
 fire proof driving suits special wheels and tires for testing and race transport to move the car at least 40k 
 for expenses accommodation and meals in newfoundland for at least 10 days airline tickets for the team to and from 
 newfoundland a thousand hero cards that all the teams needed to satisfy the autograph seekers at each stop along the 
 rally route and a myriad of other minor expenses along the way we agreed that we should be ready 18 
 months later for the 2011 tenth anniversary event 
 75 the next day i prepared a proposal for supporters to consider and sent it to some racing contacts when 
 i came back to my computer an hour later i was shocked to see a week s worth of messages 
 cued up waiting for a response the targa organization had waived the five thousand dollar entry fee and was arranging 
 as much free accommodation for the drivers as possible doug metham targa s man on the mainland had some ideas 
 where we might source a car the motorsport club of ottawa mco where i m a member waived the fee 
 for the two soldiers to attend race driver school at the new track at calabogie outside ottawa and the owners 
 of the calabogie race track offered free track time for practice glen clark also an mco member and a past 
 outright winner of the targa volunteered to provide rally instruction and offered free participation at his rally schools in ottawa 
 and newfoundland and country racewear offered to make the expensive special driving suits team jackets and shirts i called jody 
 and andrew and said if i can arrange a car and expense money within the next month do you want 
 to forget 2011 and compete this year jody s response was andrew get your driving shoe singular ready we re 
 going racing now i needed help on the mechanical side if we were going to find and prepare the right 
 car that was easy my friend and team mate at the 2004 targa and the owner and crew chief of 
 the formula car team i race with nigel mortimer volunteered to take on the coordination of preparing the car nigel 
 is also the chief instructor at the mco driving school where i also instruct so we would be able to 
 personally deliver the race driving instruction initially doug metham recommended we contact toyota as they were getting a good deal 
 of bad press regarding multiple recalls we knew they still had the race prepared hybrid toyota that participated in the 
 targa a few years back i figured hybrid soldiers in a hybrid car would garner a lot of publicity toyota 
 was keen for a couple of weeks and then backed out allegedly because of their concern that isolating the on 
 board batteries in the event of an accident would be more challenging for multiple amputees they obviously didn t know 
 jody and andrew toyota s turning us down was the best luck we had during the entire six month project 
 for it pointed us in the direction of honda canada thanks again to doug mepham i called richard jacobs retired 
 us army the senior public relations officer at honda and briefed him on what we were trying to do within 
 hours honda canada was fully committed and authorized by the president himself mr masahiro takedagawa now that we had the 
 car we needed money for expenses and i didn t want to spend a cent of tax receiptable support as 
 any such donations should go to the soldier on fund i sit on a number of mining boards within the 
 forbes manhattan group led by stan bahrti stan has an annual golf tournament in muskoka for the many bay street 
 investors who finance his operations in july after the tournament dinner i gave a short presentation on jody andrew and 
 their plan to compete in this year s targa and less than three minutes later i had every dollar i 
 needed to do the project without cutting corners over the next two months the acura tl sh awd was race 
 prepared in toronto including a modified roll cage with easier access jody and andrew excelled at the race car driving 
 school did a couple of practice rallies were fitted for driving suits and helmets and managed to keep their day 
 jobs a press conference was held at the canadian war museum in august to officially introduce the team during which 
 both soldiers demonstrated their ease with the media which augured well for all the publicity they were about to get 
 early on ctv s tom clark my friend and reporting mentor on a number of trips to somalia bosnia belgrade 
 and kosovo promised w 5 would cover the story from day one inside track canada s premier motorsport magazine offered 
 constant support and gave the project lots of print honda canada provided us with two crew members rob zarcone and 
 eric vlasic who knew the acura inside out and were great support to nigel bearing in mind the beating the 
 car would be subject to at the targa a number of modifications to brakes and cooling were made before the 
 car was put on the trailer and sent off to newfoundland on 8 september we all flew to st johns 
 in time for a reception for jody and andrew hosted by the lieutenant governor john crosbie the room was filled 
 with afghan veterans from the rock as everyone wanted a piece of our two drivers i had to exert my 
 mommy role making sure they got a good night sleep as once the competition started they would get very little 
 the competition started on monday the 13 th of september and ended five days and 2 250 kms later each 
 day there were eight special stages varying in length from five to 40 kms each stage had a very quick 
 minimum time that had to be achieved and if you made that time on all forty stages you won a 
 targa plate less than half the 60 teams would do so the other time that had to be met was 
 in many stages impossible to achieve but the team who was quickest in each stage received the fewest penalty points 
 and at the end of the week the team with the fewest penalty points was declared the winner some days 
 the weather was appalling a hint of what was to happen a week later when the area of the competition 
 was severely damaged by hurricane igor and jody and andrew had forty chances to make one driving error that would 
 mean no targa plate some teams were back for their sixth time without once winning a plate our team was 
 in a strong second place on the third day and were putting pressure on the leading factory entry in their 
 category when its engine grenaded just in front of them a piece of the piston imbedded in the acura s 
 michelin tire but it only caused a slow leak and the car made it to the finish line now in 
 first place late on the fifth day at the st john s harbour wharf the results were announced and mcpl 
 jody mitic and cpl andrew knisley not only won their targa plate but also won their category modern large displacement

 st century vis a vis princess patricia s canadian light infantry shortly after returning from the second world war the 
 regiment moved from manitoba to currie barracks calgary on 10 june 1946 and become canada s first peacetime parachute regiment 
 on 15 august 1950 a second battalion of the regiment was formed for immediate deployment to korea having a major 
 role in preventing the capture of seoul korea s capitol city 2 ppcli was awarded the united states presidential unit 
 citation the regiment had earned further distinction and honour by exercising its freedom of the city in calgary on 25 
 april 1952 thanks to calgarians appreciation and generosity freedom of the city is the highest honour that a municipality can 
 bestow upon a military unit with both battalions back from korea the first and second battalions alternately served in cold 
 war germany while rotating its airborne role by 1957 the patricias had moved from currie barracks to edmonton the first 
 battalion and regimental headquarters returned to currie barracks in 1968 where they remained until closure of the base in 1998 
 but not before exercising another freedom of the city parade on 11 june 1997 today princess patricia s canadian light

 raising of ranch sign raising the cayoosh ranch sign for nutts 
 sb cayoosh ranch alexis creek bc lieutenant andrew richard nuttall andrew or andy drew or nutts as he was known 
 in the military loved the outdoors he enjoyed camping hiking and surfing with his friends in 2005 his family bought 
 property near alexis creek in the chilcotin area of british columbia when he visited the property he took to it 
 immediately the grassy benches the groves of trees the chilcotin river with his father he picked the site where he 
 wanted to build a cabin he said we should put up a sign and this was his first priority for 
 the ranch this summer over the years the property was a source of many enjoyable conversations it embraced many of 
 his dreams for the future camping building a cabin and taking care of the land the sign was discussed often 
 during his conversations on the satellite telephone from afghanistan about one week before he was killed he asked again if 
 we had ordered a sign to be made in january in a casual conversation with bgen andre corbould then commander 
 of the first canadian mechanized brigade group andy s wish to have a sign at the ranch was raised and 
 bgen corbould said he thought it would be a great idea if his platoon could come and do this on 
 their return from afghanistan bgen corbould said his family lived in bella coola and he knew the area well this 
 sign was designed by len gibbs of victoria and carved by ken sheen of riske creek our neighbors from alexis

 92 trail riders support soldier on by lori mcnabb edmonton garrison saddle club this canada day was a little different 
 than previous years at the edmonton garrison saddle club this year someone planted an idea in the minds and hearts 
 of our members we wondered if we could host a trail ride that could raise money for the soldier on 
 fund what started out as a simple suggestion with great intentions blossomed into something wonderful that saddle club members hope 
 will be the first of many more to follow our trail ride was open to the public and we were 
 determined to make this the best organized ride ever riders arrived on june 30 to prepare and rest before the 
 ride which was scheduled to take place rain or shine on july 1 between 10 a m and 1 p 
 m riders came from all over with their horses in tow we had 33 horse riders participate and many volunteers 
 who made this day a huge success riders saddled up their four legged friends for a three hour trail ride 
 through approximately 13 5 kms of the base training area the sun was shining and it was a wonderful day 
 for a trail ride the edmonton garrison saddle club hosted this ride to raise money for the soldier on fund 
 which provides rehabilitation services to soldiers severely injured in conflict the fund helps get them involved in a variety of 
 athletic programs we were very fortunate to have maj mark campbell and his family attend we presented him with a 
 cheque for 4 500 that will be forwarded onto the soldier on fund maj campbell explained to everyone how much 
 it meant to him that we hosted the trail ride to raise money for this worthwhile cause he told us 
 about how he was able to enjoy a ski expedition thanks to the soldier on fund photos courtesy of lori

 honouring the old guard by sgt k t maceachern in may 2009 a handful of second world war veterans walked 
 the ground in italy from the landing in sicily through the gustav hitler and gothic lines all the way through 
 to the towns of cassino ortona rimini and villanova 2 and 3 ppcli each sent five representatives along with one 
 rcr and three strathcona soldiers to accompany and honour our veterans as they returned to the battlefields they had fought 
 on along the way up the boot of italy we stopped at each graveyard it was humbling to see soldiers 
 grave stones with a maple leaf etched on top and princess patricia s canadian light infantry written above their name 
 some had quotes from families etched near the bottom personal and touching the age of each soldier when he died 
 carried the weight of what the country had lost and sacrificed marking each graveyard was the commonwealth cross a monument 
 to the soldiers of the allied force as we toured through the battlefields we went through many small towns that 
 had been liberated by canadians each had dedicated plaques and held ceremonies for our soldiers in celebration of the anniversary 
 of their liberation it was impressive to see the town peoples knowledge of each regiment that had walked through and 
 liberated them from the germans in one case a town parade had escorted the veterans in three wwii jeeps up 
 main street as the locals lined the road cheering as they passed walking the fields of italy is just a 
 small step in honouring our veterans dressed for a memorial parade at the commonwealth cemetery in monte casino the allied 
 force graveyard for fallen heroes of gustav and hitler line i saw more than one old soldier with two or 
 three campaign crosses one in particular tom baker carried three crosses above his left chest pocket as well as a 
 medal for dieppe to survive through the campaigns of north africa italy and 
 northern europe is no small feat but to also have been on the assault at dieppe and survive is a 
 testament to the fortitude of our heroes another veteran rudy deutsch has powerful memories of his experience as a medic 
 stretcher bearer for the ppcli during the battle for ortona and the breaking of the hitler line bill ford was 
 a strathcona veteran until halfway through italy where in one day he lost his entire troop at the battle of 
 torrice cross roads he then became a stretcher bearer for the remainder of the war bernie pelletier tells the story 
 of when he engaged and destroyed a german aircraft in his bren gun carrier running from the aircrafts wingman as 
 he avoided the aerial machine gun strafing fire all these stories impress upon the professionalism of the soldiers before us 
 we hope to one day carry the torch they so proudly passed in each area traveled we met local historians 
 officials hobbyists and collectors they are all extremely proud of the canadians and their contribution to the war karen koonar 
 the historian working with the ppcli regimental museum and who coordinated the tour ha built lasting friendships with some of 
 these historians one in particular alessandro campagna from the town of frosinone located 80 km south of rome made his 
 first visit to western canada for a reunion of travelers and veterans at the military museums in august 2010 i 
 was able to attend the reunion on behalf of the other patricias who had traveled to italy and the time 
 was spent telling stories sharing photos and videos generated during the 2009 tour the effort by alessandro in traveling to 
 canada to honour our veterans and the work that is being done to preserve the history of the italian campaign 
 here at home is remarkable alessandro s presence with the veterans at the reunion inspired a coming together of the 
 old guard giving these soldiers an opportunity to show off their medals as badges of honour and rekindle old friendships 
 both canadian and italian soldiers never die we just fade away

 in the 3 ppcli building at edmonton garrison 48 candidates began the cf basic parachutist course this particular serial was 
 unique because it was the first jump course that has ever been exported from the cf land advanced warfare centre 
 located at cfb trenton ont i was one of the candidates on the course which ran from 19 july to 
 6 august 2010 the course was divided into two phases ground training and jump week or j stage as the 
 instructors kept saying the first 10 training days consisted of ground training which consisted of equipment aircraft drill flight and 
 landings during equipment training we learned how to prepare our rucksacks and weapons for parachuting aircraft drill is exactly what 
 it sounds like learning all the drills involved with the aircraft from the time you board the plane to the 
 time you exit flight included everything you need to know once you exit the aircraft to just before you land 
 although flight sounds like fun it consists of lots and lots of time hanging in the racks the nickname given 
 to the training harnesses which simulates a parachutist under canopy just imagine pulling chin ups for seven consecutive minutes and 
 you ll start to get a feeling of how hard it is flight training was exhausting to say the least 
 as well as uncomfortable cc 130 hercules parachute door candidates wearing their parachute training harnesses are dispatched by parachute instructors

 and when the candidates jump from the door we fall 10 feet and then glide down the cables to a 
 grass mound where we are disconnected from the cables the mock tower training consisted of three days and included single 
 exits mass exits and exits with full equipment i can confidently say that not a single candidate left without bruises 
 also known as riser kisses on his shoulders and neck following the mock tower training all candidates were tested on 
 everything we had been taught thankfully the majority of us passed and were able to move on to j stage 
 the start of j stage was very exciting for us for a few reasons it meant that we were going 
 to start actually jumping out of a plane we soon learned that jumping out of the plane was the easy 
 part a typical jump saw us exit the aircraft conduct our flight procedures and then land 30 to 40 seconds 
 in total landings consisted of learning the proper body position and technique to employ the proper parachute landing fall one 
 of our instructors told us if you re going to be good at only one thing on this course hopefully 
 it s landings we all found out on j stage just how right he was i still have bruises on 
 all five points of contact but walked away all okay after every jump i m glad i paid attention in 
 those classes not like i had a choice atypical day during ground training started with morning physical training at 0530 
 hrs it usually consisted of a quick run with the course officer by quick run i mean a quick pace 
 after that we had time to shower eat and get ready for the days training we would be ready at 
 the battalion by 0730 hrs a typical day consisted of six lessons after we were taught a lesson and shown 
 the standard we immediately started practicing it the days training usually went until 1630 hrs and ended with light physical 
 conditioning consisting of a thorough stretch i think this is the part of the course that all candidates enjoyed the 
 most by the time the course got to afternoon physical training we could barely put our hands above our heads 
 due to the racks one of the more enjoyable parts of the course was the nock tower the mock tower 
 is a 32 foot high replica of a under the watchful eye of a parachute instructor candidates practice aircraft drills 
 in the mock up of a cc 130 hercules aircraft two candidates exit the mock tower which is a 32 
 foot replica of a cc 130 hercules aircraft parachute door experienced parachute instructors pay attention to deta as they assess 
 how each candidate exits to ensure the proper drills are demonstrated 
 109 i think that special attention should be given to landings because that s when the majority of injuries could 
 occur due to improper form if a landing is done properly candidates perform a nice roll and the impact of 
 hitting the ground is absorbed through the entire body the great part is that even in high winds if a 
 parachutist does a good landing they barely feel the ground candidates buckle up in a casa c 212 aircraft which 
 is designed specifically for parachutists a similar aircraft is used by the cf sky hawks parachute team on the other 
 hand if a candidate doesn t do what they were taught they risk broken ankles slipped discs in their backs 
 concussions and a number of other injuries which unfortunately some of the guys experienced first hand after packing up the 
 parachute we would then run back to the drop zone rendezvous i guess that s why the course officer ran 
 us every morning forty two of the original 48 candidates completed the necessary five descents our jumps ranged from noequipment 
 0:no 0:equipment to full equipment in order to qualify after that we did some extra jumps to gain more experience 
 on average we completed j stage with 10 jumps each and at least triple the number of bruises i can 
 tell you that this course is a highlight of my career and the bonds formed between the candidates on basic 
 parachutist session 104 will carry on for the rest of our lives i can say for certain that every candidate 
 including myself is looking forward to the next jump and getting more time under canopy airborne a candidate on the 
 cf basic parachutist course jumps into drop zone buxton at cfb edmonton the course was conducted by 3 ppcli from 
 19 july to 6 august this was the first jump course that has ever been exported from cf land advanced 
 warfare centre located at cfb trenton on

 111 ppcli association president s report 2010 as my term as president of the ppcli association draws to a close 
 i would like to take this opportunity to thank my executive past and present for all their assistance and hard 
 work during the past four years the association has been faced with many challenges and road blocks although with determination 
 we have prevailed maybe not in ways that some would do it however the executive and council made things work 
 to the best of their ability the biggest challenge is membership and if we want to have 2 014 members 
 for 2014 we have to start now the membership plan for 2011 2015 will be a discussion item at the 
 agm in wainwright and the membership committee has put a lot of work into this plan over the past year 
 as an association we have donated a great deal of money to worthwhile projects such as 30 000 to the 
 museum and 4 500 to each ppcli cadet corps as the regiment moves closer to the 100 th anniversary many 
 hurdles will have to be overcome by the regimental family which includes the association in may 2011 a new executive 
 will be elected to lead the association into the regiment s 100 th anniversary i hope that the council will 
 support them as they did me in closing i must point out a couple of items that everyone should be 
 made aware of when it comes time for association members to step up and volunteer to take on a challenge 
 simply ask them and without hesitation they step forward and except the challenge so think of this what are we 
 as an association and where are we going once a patricia always a patricia bert scott president ppcli association vp

 hosted by the french grey battalion fgb both meetings were organized and coordinated by cwo tim penney rsm of the 
 fgb and also a member of this branch we are most grateful to tim and his wife linda for their 
 hard work and dedication these two meetings gave us the opportunity to socialize with many fgb members and to hear 
 first hand of some of their experiences both agms were chaired by president brian furlong who retired after the 2010 
 agm we want to thank brian for his excellent leadership during his time as president especially since he was operating 
 from st john s nl while the majority of the membership is in the other atlantic provinces brian was replaced

 arrangements were made for dave pentney to provide a remote briefing on the major projects for 2014 this was of 
 particular interest because atlantic branch is responsible to coordinate the frezenberg memorial project a detailed briefing on the status of 
 this project was provided by dave snowball who chairs the frezenberg committee the atlantic branch maintains a paid membership of 
 about 45 members who are scattered throughout the region with sizeable groups in truro kentville and bridgewater ns we also 
 have four honorary members who are the parents of patricias killed in afghanistan we are attempting to reach out to 
 any retired patricias in the area in hopes of increasing membership for 2014 we welcome any information that might help 
 us achieve this goal as in all branches there is a shortage of younger members and the rest of us

 113 sw ontario branch pc u assoc n w we started 2010 with our annual march 17 lh festivities again 
 this year at betty s restaurant in niagara falls member turnout was good with positive feedback to repeat this function 
 again in 2011 the branch supplied the ppcli decorative cake with plenty to go around and some left over for 
 the restaurant staff to enjoy our agm took place on 1 may 2010 at the holiday inn in st catharines 
 as our normal location was unavailable due to renovations again we had a good turnout for all our functions at 
 our dinner we had two special duties to perform the first was to mug out wo kevin ryan who was 
 retiring from the service and joined our association the second task was to award wo ret d bill johnson with 
 the governor general s special citation which was given to his unit for action in the medak pocket former yugoslavia 
 when the unit was given this award in 2002 bill had already retired from service so was not available at 
 that time to receive it bill on a previous occasion had already been awarded the medal of bravery for his 
 rescue of a wounded french soldier from the minefield in that same action our agm for 2011 is scheduled for 
 the weekend of 7 to 8 may on 19 june the branch was invited to take part in another wonderful 
 event for our association doug and pauline armstrong both members of our association invited our members to celebrate with them 
 on their 65 th wedding anniversary doug a young lt in the ppcli and pauline a nurse in the army 
 corps met in england in 1943 they were married on 20 june 1945 in bloemendaal holland by the local burgomiester 
 and later had a regimental wedding in a local church by a patricia padre the armstrong s held this event 
 at their home in st catharines with many family members including their two sons and one daughter several of our 
 local members turned out to help them celebrate this special event doug pauline and their 3 children are shown in 
 the picture our summer bbq on 20 july had a low attendance this year the weather cooperated nicely with plenty 
 of sunshine we believe this was due to the last minute announcement from via rail to offer free rail travel 
 again this year in the month of july for 2011 we will make sure not to plan it in summer 
 months and aim closer to the end of the summer season this way we hope not to interfere with vacation 
 plans usually taken in that time period the association attended various functions within our region to support things such as 
 warriors day un peacekeeper day remembrance day etc on 23 september 2010 we attended a ceremony to officially commemorate and 
 change the name of highway 420 which leads into niagara falls to niagara veteran s memorial highway we were informed 
 that there are now only 12 highways in north america with such distinction eight are in the usa and four 
 in canada ours was number 12 doug and pauline armstrong both members of our association invited our members to celebrate

 nw ontario our year began with the branch annual general meeting agm on 31 january this was an election year 
 but as we were preparing to host the ppcli association national agm in may we decided to defer our branch 
 elections until that was over our first social function was our regimental day celebration on 14 march at the charleswood 
 legion where we hoisted a few and toasted the regiment and the ladies the ppcli association agm and associated events 
 at the marlborough hotel in winnipeg on 14 to 15 may was a grand reunion patricias came from the west 
 coast the east coast and points between don cook came all the way from nagasaki japan a great reunion with 
 old comrades and with members service ranging from the korean war to recent operations in afghanistan we heard some great 
 stories at the meet and greet we were fortunate in being joined by our patron the right honourable adrienne clarkson 
 as well as outgoing colonel of the regiment larry gollner and incoming colonel of the regiment ray crabbe as well 
 as several serving members of the regiment we also had a kitshop provided by second battalion that was particularly appreciated 
 by those members who don t have convenient access to the kitshops in edmonton or shilo the association dinner was 
 very enjoyable with fine food good service and music played at a volume which actually allowed us to converse without 
 yelling the branch held a general meeting on 6 june primarily for the election of officers which had been deferred 
 at the annual meeting in january the following were elected or re elected president stu weeks manitoba branch vice president 
 cliff fox secretary maureen blake treasurer darcy best directors mike czuboka taffy gray susan holfeuer and norm mayo we were 
 pleasantly surprised to have vince kennedy co chairman of the regiment s 100 th anniversary planning committee attend our meeting 
 he gave us an update on the regiment s preparation for the 100 th anniversary and dropped a few hints 
 on how we might raise funds for the frezenberg memorial we had our branch barbecue at the charleswood legionn on 
 sunday august 15th the rotten weather spoiled our bocce tournament but the food was excellent 25 members and guests including 
 a few who we hadn t seen for a while enjoyed some fine food and good company at our fall 
 luncheon at the marlborough hotel on 26 september a few of our branch members attended the november 11 remembrance day 
 service at oak park high school the auditorium was literally packed to the rafters with people from the charleswood legion 
 17 wing rcmp boy scouts and girl guides air cadets and the general public bud hawkins escorted by archie moore 
 laid a wreath on behalf of the ppcli association it was also a proud moment for the patricias when cpl 
 ryan elrick who lost both his legs in afghanistan marched down the aisle to lay a wreath on behalf of 
 the afghanistan veterans in contrast our all saints church remembrance service on 14 november was not very well attended by 
 our members or the congregation although we did have some support from our 2701 ppcli cadet corps it is sad 
 to see the declining attendance at this annual event as this church has been associated with ppcli since the regiment 
 came to winnipeg in 1920 and our first colours were laid up there in 1934 our planned trip to shilo 
 for the second battalion christmas dinner on 16 december had to be cancelled when weather conditions caused the highway to 
 be closed between portage la prairie and brandon this was a big disappointment for some of us who have attended 
 every year since the battalion moved to shilo in 2004 new members in 2010 include roy maceachern who served with 
 second battalion in croatia two tours in bosnia and one in afghanistan cpl david hancock of second battalion and his 
 wife tamara who was recently awarded a ppcli association student bursary and recently retired cwo jim zelazny on the down 
 side len quinlan passed away in january and muriel griffiths in september and john and sandra mcgregor and dennis moore

 with their donations and gifts to the food bank and to santa s anonymous several members made the journey to 
 winnipeg for the agm and were treated very well the branch again was in attendance at the 2551 ppcli cadet 
 corps year end parade a highlight for the branch was the induction of the 32 members of the edmonton police 
 pipes and drums as honourary associate members the branch was deeply saddened with the passing of harry moore in august 
 and ted bastein in december we were able to recruit seven members who joined at the end of the year 
 our membership not only dwells in edmonton but we have members residing in saskatchewan china japan prince george kelowna the 
 usa wetaskiwin spruce grove peace river manitoba bawlf montreal st paul red deer barrhead etc just to name a few

 121 vancouver branch assocltf 1 this year has certainly passed rather quickly or maybe we are just getting older and 
 time passes us by faster it has been a fairly quiet year for the branch we had our branch annual 
 general meeting at the end of march before our annual regimental day luncheon the event was a little late this 
 year as the armory was being used by the rcmp for the olympics and para olympic events as there were 
 no elections slated the meeting went quickly and we moved onto the social hour before the luncheon one of our 
 members who we had lost touch with robert smiley douglas izatt was found to be in the george derby and 
 bob mcdonald was planning on bringing him to the luncheon but unfortunately he passed away suddenly we had 16 members 
 in attendance and 11 guests the pmc of the wo s sgt s mess and his wife were once again 
 representatives for the seaforths the president gave a brief talk on an article printed in the sunday telegraph in the 
 united kingdom which saluted the quality of a canadian soldier two of the guests at the meeting wives of present 
 members became members themselves a former patricia who we had helped get a regimental 90th birthday certificate for in january 
 hugh tinney passed away in may although he hadn t been a member of the association we were able to 
 facilitate the certificate for the family who were having a surprise party for him in january being a very shy 
 man he didn t want a big fuss but the family was thrilled at the regiment s handling of the 
 matter in august we had our annual bbq at the home of val tutte and again our numbers were down 
 but a great time was had by all helga and don boyce dropped in from the hinterlands of agazzis giving 
 us a total of 13 members and four guests on 12 december we had our xmas party at jenny urquhart 
 s lovely home with 14 members and two guests who became members though the numbers were down a bit everyone 
 had a good time and there was no snow which is always a plus although two of our members died 
 this year and one dropped out we gained four new members so our membership numbers are holding steady especially in

 truly a nice touch very often following meet and greets in the hospitality centre and prior to retiring to the 
 rooms time is spent in quiet conversation with comrades this is perhaps the best part of the routine now just 
 imagine how much reminiscing gets done you would certainly pick up a bunch of new tales for back home patricias 
 are a piece of real military history and it is safe to say that one or more stories are hidden 
 in the minds of many many bring impressions of war indelibly etched in their memory still today they are ever 
 aware of what s happening daily between north and south korea time passes yet it is a time some recall 
 with the patricias being actively engaged in afghanistan this action was not far from anyone s mind or memory a 
 happy balance of activities met all interests including shopping two indoor pools golfing and a walk along the waterfront thursday 
 afternoon the first thing i became aware of was the wonderful smell of food so we would like to take 
 this opportunity to express our thanks to frank oertel head chef and caterer thursday a crowd of patricias were gathered 
 around the piklee draw drum to watch and hear as the draw helps sustain the club the excitement grew as 
 another winning number was called the last number called bill wilkinson and don boyce trail by the crowd leaving the

 125 origins of mademoiselle from armentieres submitted by lcol ret d hans j brink originally published in the edmonton journal 
 and reprinted in january 1933 in the forty niner last week there was told in this column the story of 
 the origin of that famous wartime song mademoiselle from armentieres since then there has arrived on my desk a copy 
 of the london sunday express with some more information here is the story as it appears in the london newspaper 
 yesterday a man walked into the sunday express office and claimed to be the author of the immortal ditty he 
 is mr reginald rowland sergeant red rowland late of the a s c and now the manager of a cinema 
 in putney this he says is the authentic history of the song early in 1915 sergeant rowlands organized a concert 
 for troops billeted in bailleul the men were sick of sloppy sentimentality and songs like come back to erin or 
 don t go down the mine daddy would have been howled down the men asked for a song with some 
 go in it and i had to write it said mr rowlands what were they interested in girls food drink 
 in a flash the inspiration came there was in armentieres a girl who had set the hearts of almost the 
 whole british army throbbing marie of the cafe de la paix was the embodiment of universal womanhood she was vital 
 alive silent and magnetic with her great mane of blonde silken hair she would stand before the cafe door challenging 
 life and commanding adoration her aloofness became legendary along the whole british line men worshipped her but with none did 
 she become friendly i thought of marie as my mind searched wildly for a subject for a song with pep 
 and snap to it mademoiselle our mademoiselle mademoiselle and armentieres mademoiselle from armentieres as soon as i had said that 
 to myself i knew i had found the song the subject was one they all knew mademoiselle from armentieres the 
 lilt was there you could feel yourself marching to it within half an hour the verses were written in fifteen 
 minutes that lightning music composer gitz rice had set it to music that night i put over a winner the 
 original verses somehow became garbled some of the later verses do not quite carry out the song s original theme 
 as many ex soldiers will know i have never heard what has happened to marie but england owes a great 
 debt of gratitude to this cafe waitress who made it easy for men to march resolutely to what for many 
 of them was death mademoiselle from armentieres mademoiselle from armentieres parley voo mademoiselle from armentieres parley voo mademoiselle from armentieres

 127 2551 ppcli royal canadian army cadets 2551 ppcli army cadets take pride in pushing themselves always to higher standards 
 in 2010 we carried on that tradition cdt sgt eugen kolesnik and cdt sgt ahsan hassan started the year by 
 taking the top two positions in alberta for the national star certification examination not to be outdone the marksmanship team 
 consisting of cdt cpl robert danylchuk cdt mcpl srosh hassan cdt mcpl stephen larsen cdt wo eugen kolesnik and cdt 
 wo ahsan hassan set a new personal team record at the provincial marksmanship championship by achieving 1515 out of a 
 possible 1600 danylchuk and kolesnik advanced to nationals in the junior and open categories respectively the fact that it was 
 danylchuk s first year shooting made it even more remarkable the amazing coaching of civilian instructor ci charles bernatchez helped 
 establish the fact that this is the 10 m consecutive year where a member of the corps has advanced to 
 the national marksmanship championship the team also performed well in the dominion of canada rifle association competition where cdt cwo 
 taha hassan got honours for top score and the team finished 6 th in the country financial restraints on the 
 unit resulted in a fairly quiet year however the cadets came together to organize and run a bottle drive in 
 order to finance our annual may long weekend expedition wild patricia we spent the long weekend mountain biking in beautiful 
 kananaskis although preliminary introduction took place around our campground a full day of biking the trails of the canmore nordic 
 centre provided plenty of opportunities for pictures and stories that were shared around the campfire that evening our ability to 
 adapt to alberta s ever changing weather was tested when we returned to the campground for supper and a freak 
 hailstorm hit the makeshift dinning hall that the senior cadets created with a tarp and some string became the social 
 hot spot for the evening june brought the closing of my first year as co although filled with more challenges 
 then expected the attitude of the cadets and staff to persevere and help improve the unit was encouraging we were 
 honoured with maj gerhard hildebrant as our reviewing officer during our annual ceremonial review and open house the cadets had 
 many interactive displays and activities running in order to demonstrate to family and friends all that they had learned throughout 
 the year the marksmanship and imp tasting stations were as usual quite busy this year a new display chronicling the 
 history of the corps was put forth and it was interesting for the staff and cadets to look at pictures 
 of the unit over the last 55 years it s good to note that our cadets went out and represented 
 our corps at a number of summer camps including general training basic physical education recreational training adventure marksmanship as well 
 as exchanges to germany and wales although cdt cwo taha hassan has aged out as the rsm of the corps 
 his performance at bisley over the previous two summers earned him a spot on the bisley team staff as a 
 ci and we were excited to welcome him back as a ci to the unit as the new administration officer 
 in september both of the cadets that attended exchanges received special note of outstanding performance on their performance reports in 
 fact most of the cadets that attended summer camps received comments regarding the high standard they had demonstrated september not 
 only welcomed back our returning cadets and staff but also 20 new cadets and several new staff members the new 
 staff consists of 2lt alexandre lord who is an rcmp officer in his civilian job ci helen croll who just 
 retired after 22 years in the british military and ci ryan rosenthal who was a previous rsm at this unit 
 we were also privileged to receive assistance from 2lt casey anderson from the intelligence unit at brigade headquarters but most 
 of all we were especially pleased to welcome the return of mcpl tom millar of 3 ppcli who had recently 
 returned from tour in afghanistan returning with him was our corps jacket that he took to be signed while he 
 was there it s expected to be formally presented to the cadets in the new year after being framed the 
 cadets and staff of 2551 ppcli are extremely thankful to the edmonton ppcli association for their continued support and the 
 members of 3 ppcli and all patricias for continuing to be an inspiration for us 
 2554 ppcli royal canadian army cadet corps by cdt wo alexis daley our cadet corps has worked very hard over 
 this past year even though we work hard we still have a lot of fun doing it we try to 
 have as many field training exercises as we can we often have other cadet corps join us we make them 
 enjoyable while applying the tools that we learn in our classroom lessons on our weekend exercises we conduct outdoor lessons 
 like learning how to build your own improvised shelter survival fires that would be used for heat as well as 
 cooking and signal fires throughout the weekend the cadets practice map and compass skills which help them with orienteering on 
 our last night out we have a night navigation course where the cadets practice their orienteering and teamwork skills these 
 are a lot of fun and the cadets really enjoy doing this at the end of the weekend right before 
 we leave we conduct team building games so the cadets can have fun hanging out before the busses come and 
 they still learn that working as a team can be a lot more fun than expected on the may long 
 weekend we got together with four other cadet corps at rocky mountain national army cadet summer training centre to have 
 a three day adventure training exercise the first year cadets went hiking and the second year cadets did mountain biking 
 and slept in tents outside as the younger cadets went through their training the senior cadets had the chance to 
 staff the weekend it was fun and was a great learning experience for everyone involved we also got to participate 
 in the first army cadet challenge at the edmonton garrison in october which was a great success the competition consisted 
 of booths where each team of cadets would be tested on their cadet knowledge and fundamental training other than the 
 competition we got to hang out with some of the ppcli soldiers to see what their jobs consisted of that 
 included completing an obstacle course and the mock tower we learned how soldiers do building clearance and about mine awareness 
 while some of the younger cadets got to ride around in the armored vehicles field activity cdt mcpl in the 
 bore biathlon race other weekend activities consisted of going to the rifle range which we did in october cadets shoot 
 the 22 calibre lee enfield no 7 rifle and the 177 calibre air rifle the male biathlon team for our 
 corps won bronze in the zone competition and the rifle team won bronze as well one cadet from our team 
 was able to make it to the provincial championships for biathlon as an individual competitor he will be going to 
 compete on a composite team with cadets from other corps earlier this year our corps had the chance to help 
 the ppcli museum archives it was great because the cadets had the chance to see and browse historical documents that 
 you cannot find displayed in the museum itself we helped rearrange shelves and organize some of the documents looking through 
 the regiment s history was very interesting for the cadets they were excited to know that there was a lot 
 more to our history than they have studied or heard about our cadets take great pride in what our cadet 
 corps stands for some of the cadets even learned that some of their family members were enrolled with the princess 
 patricia s canadian light infantry on 9 november we had veterans and present day soldiers come to teach us about 
 military history this was during our regimental history night the cadets split of into groups and each group went to 
 a different table where the soldiers and veterans had displays of historical items there were letters pictures medals and items 
 from the ppcli kit shop we spoke to soldiers that have been in active wars such as afghanistan and world 
 war 11 we all appreciated the time and effort these men put into coming to see us we learned a 
 lot from them on 11 november we took part in the remembrance day ceremonies at the military museum in calgary 
 for the cadets this is very important as it gives them an opportunity to pay their respects to the people 
 that have served their country all in all we hope our cadet corps continues to grow we have planned many 
 more events for the coming year last year there were 27 cadets enrolled this year there are 36 and hopefully 
 more to come

 our cadets heading off to summer camp we had two cadets cdt sgt buzahora and cdt sgt branton go to 
 rocky mountain with our current cdt csm staffing the course after summer camp and with the beginning of our training 
 year we saw a very good influx of new cadets to the corps which vastly improved our overall numbers our 
 first exercise of the year in september was a success for the new cadets as they learned basic bush craft 
 map and compass and survival skills in the beginning of october we sent a team of cadets to shilo for 
 the army cadet challenge the weekend event consisted of corps competing against each other in various skill at arms expose 
 activities the end of the weekend saw 2701 prevail as the top team overall during the month of october cdt

 130 2837 royal canadian army cadet corps cdt mcpl aiden forsyth 2010 was a very unique and rewarding year for 
 2837 it included accomplishments at our local headquarters and at the whitehorse cadet summer training center one of the most 
 noticeable improvements for the corps was our change in facilities we had been parading out of a rented gymnasium during 
 the previous training year but beginning in september we changed locations and now have the upper floor of a local 
 school the school generously gave not only a gym but also an office several classrooms and a supply room this 
 would not have been possible without building effective positive relationships between 2837 and the community to do this the cadets 
 worked to earn the trust of the community by volunteering to clean up the local shooting range conducting poppy drives 
 for the legion providing cadets for school and community remembrance day ceremonies and completing an all night vigil on the 
 night of 10 11 november 2010 started off with promotions and our winter field training exercise ftx race day the 
 brisk january morning started off very early in order to make the most out of the day the cadets were 
 split into teams and the teams were required to complete a series of challenges at various checkpoints along a course 
 the challenges included building a snow shelter building a stable flagpole on which to hoist the ppcli flag moving a 
 casualty up a hillside and setting up and subsequently dismantling a five man arctic bell tent during this the cadets 
 needed to regulate their pace food consumption and maintain their own morale however as all cadets soon became aware it 
 was not by who was strongest or fastest that allowed a team to pull ahead but how well the team 
 followed direction and worked together in february of 2010 2837 went to quebec city to visit 2846 ancienne lorette for 
 a week there the corps went on tours of the old city watched a carnavale night parade went snow tubing 
 at the valcartier village de vacances experienced a cabane a sucre and had the privilege of staying in la citadelle 
 de quebec the whole time they were there for many it was their first time away from home and was 
 a great cultural experience we left with many new friendships that will last for a long time the corps marksmanship 
 program is in the middle of some major changes we re trying new techniques and changing the way we look 
 at shooting which is a huge challenge but is already beginning to show great results spring of 2010 was an 
 exciting time for the team who went to the regional competition in whitehorse with high hopes and expectations in may 
 two cadets travelled to the national championships in edmonton where cdt wo jennings shot a perfect target with our new 
 batch of talented shooters and training program that is steadily improving we continue to aim for new heights in the 
 year to come well run ftxs are very important to the development of all cadets from the day that they 
 join to the day that they age out ftxs provide an opportunity to learn how to operate as a unit 
 in the field under all the pressures and stresses that this entails 2837 s ftxs have taken a big step 
 forward with our success being due in part to the efforts of our newly appointed exercise ncm cdt sgt fyfe 
 who diligently attended to the logistics and timings on our ftx sapling in september and made sure that everything was 
 running smoothly start to finish the commanding officer capt mccann had praised the exercise calling it the best ftx sapling 
 to date it was a great introduction for our new green stars to get a feeling about what army cadets 
 did in the field it was an opportunity as well to provide senior cadets opportunity to continue to develop their 
 leadership skills through activities such as directing the set up of a five man bell tent organizing cadets to pass 
 by another section undetected and surviving with the infamous rations the town of gibbons salutes the military andtaan 6 the 
 6pave mew and w mcm oiwjreedoma all in all 2837 has made vast improvements over the course of the 2010 
 training year from the development of junior and senior cadets seeking leadership roles to the enrolment of our brand new 
 green stars looking for a great experience with the cadet program all the training we ve received will serve us 
 well for the next training year and beyond www gibbons ca

 134 wounded soldiers learn to ski by a slt nikki murillo wing administration officer cfb comox on a foggy and 
 calm morning mcpl adam cyr did something he never thought he would do again he strapped on a pair of 
 ski and shred some powder down a mountain just 18 months earlier he was ambushed during the last patrol of 
 his second tour in kandahar province with the 2 ppcli bg the attack was costly he lost his right leg 
 blow the knee and suffered severe burns to much of his body it was a long road to recovery on 
 1 february 2010 mcpl cyr along with a sit ski took part in the third soldier on and vancouver island 
 society for adaptive snowsports visas veteran s learn to ski program he was joined on the slopes by canadian paralympics 
 ski team member andrea dziewior a visas veteran and by the fourth day was feeling pretty confident in his abilities 
 was going to race her dziewior today but i didn t want to psych her out before the olympics said 
 mcpl cyr i think definitely one day i d like to try and get seriously involved and maybe try for 
 the paralympics but being from the prairies i d probably have to move here first these guys are a ton 
 of fun and so willing to go outside their comfort zone they re always willing to try a hill that 
 s just a little steeper i m not sure if it s because they like the challenge or chasing a 
 girl said dziewior but in all seriousness i have so much respect for what our soldiers do and even more 
 respect for the courage these soldiers are showing in their recovery and this is such a great program because sports 
 as a part of rehabilitation are as important for the mind as it is for the body mcpl cyr who

 at the end of the competition there was a day of rest built into the schedule and the patricias took 
 advantage of it to travel by car to south eastern england to visit the countess mountbatten of burma lady patricia 
 brabourne at her home the team commandant maj hildebrandt had arranged the visit with the help of regimental headquarters and 
 it was an inspiring and rewarding personal glimpse into the personal life of our beloved former colonel in chief lady 
 patricia welcomed the six of us into her home and graciously showed us around her home to see some much 
 cherished artwork memorabilia and family heirlooms she took great pleasure in showing us a framed picture of her out on 
 a day of shooting with her majesty queen elizabeth 11 both of them smiling in the english rain with lady 
 patricia proudly wearing her maroon ppcli windbreaker the stately manor and grounds was a picture perfect setting for this once 
 in a lifetime kind of meeting with lady patricia she described her beautiful home as being renovated and modernized by 
 her family before canada was even a country the patricia shooters arrived well turned out in our bisley team blazers 
 and regimental ties a fact that lady patricia seemed to greatly enjoy and she patiently posed for photographs with us 
 in one of her parlours before inviting us out into the garden for tea our garden tea party could not 
 have been more inspiring or surreal it was an experience that none of the patricias there will forget lady patricia 
 served us cake cookies raspberries and cream from her own garden and cold local beers to combat the heat of 
 the perfect summer day lady patricia chatted about life during her time spent in india and about life during the 
 war she brought out a large tome that was a biography of her father count mountbatten of burma and asked 
 us to listen while she read to us several passages in a strong voice she read passages about her father 
 s courage during his time as captain of h m s kelly off the shores of norway then while we 
 listened spellbound she segued into how she thought her patricias exemplified that notion of courage in the modern day and 
 how proud she was of us after that she presented each of us with a fantastic gift of a print 
 of the h m s kelly signed by her father the artist and personally signed by her to remind us 
 of the visit and her stories of courage after signing her guestbook it was time to go and on lady 
 patricia s advice we would visit dover and the castle there on the way home to canada house in bisley
