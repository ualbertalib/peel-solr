 holmgren one humidred years ago the first anglican church was established in edmonton with the arrival of i i missionary
 william newton when he came to his field there was no diocese of edmonton nor was there any church of
 his denomination edmonton itself consisted of little n more than the fort and its environs and was to all intents
 and purposes still an isolated fur trading post with very erratic communication with the outside world this was a land
 in transition in 1869 to the weslyan methodists now however the hudson s bay company had surrend a new prospect
 presented itself with the ered to the young dominion of canada omiset of settlement adherents of the church its title
 to rupert s land or what are now of england would arrive and deniand servthe prairie provinces and the northwest
 ices it was therefore iniperative that mis territories the fur trade was declining sions be established and churches built and
 ti ic land was open for settlement but no ultimately parishes founded great influx of settlers was to occur until
 in 1874 the right reverend john macthe completion of the dominion land sur lean was consecrated bishop of saskatveys then
 under way and the coming of chewam i bormi in scotland he had come the c p r the few

 1872 the anglican diocese of sas vast area one of these was to serve at katchewan was formed covering the
 prairie prince albert 2 the other william newprovinces a vast area with no anglican ton at edmonton missionaries in it
 up to this time the newton was born in 1828 at halstead anglican church particularly in the wes essex england
 little is known of his early tern part of this vast doniain had been life except that it appears that
 he came content to leave protestant miissionary work from a poor family and that his education mr holmgren is heritage

 lad he received his education in england and gem many and ultimately obtained a ph d at a university there
 although from which one is not known he then returned to england and entered the congregational ministry in which he
 served for a time he also marned and in 1870 he emigrated with his large family to canada here he
 entered the anglican church and was ordained to the priesthood by the bishop of toronto alexander neil bethune he served
 a few years in that diocese at rosseau in the muskoka area prior to his departure for edmonton having heard
 the call of the bishop maclean he departed for edmonton in april 1875 leaving his family in ontario newton s
 journey to edmonton was eventful to say the least he travelled by steamer to prince arthur s landing now thunder
 bay at the lakehead from there he proceeded over the famous or infamous dawson road with its inter ludes of
 steamer travel on the many lakes the rev william newion along the route his conveyance was a buckboard and when
 he came to a river to use as a church and dwelling place for it was frequently necessary for him
 to dis his first winter at edmonton apart from mantle the buckboard entirely float it and the fort there were
 only a few buildings his belongings across swim the horse over and few signs of permanent settlement were and then
 reassemble the whole on the op in evidence as newton himself reniarked posite bank he had for a travelling companion
 an english orphan boy z mo e after a tiresome and rough journey over servants of the hudson bay cornthe
 dawson road newton finally arrived pany nine miles from the fort were in winnipeg at the cud of may he
 was delayed for a short time here while he at that time a church inside the fort purchased suitable horses
 for his 900 mile itself within sight of the fort were journey westward he finally set out and also a
 methodist chapel and a parsonage the leadmg people at the fort after a long and tedious lourney across the were
 methodists and very zealous plains he arrived at his destination it was methodists too they did not often then late
 in september attend our services nor did they en to newton newly arrived from the looking around melasked settled regmons
 of ontario the first view myself what was i to do i was far of edmonton was hardly promising this
 from civilization and with only one was the ednionton that was at the thres or two posts in the year
 to bring me letters i had at hand a tent a surhold of its transition from i i a tradmng
 post plice a prayer book and a bible to a city and a provincial capital hardly there was no parsonage
 no church an encouraging prospect but as newton nor any means of building either i noted there was nowhere else
 to go after amiss na y 1 tose t remaining a few days at the fort he moved not find
 such persons as we usually into an incompleted house which he was designate settlers beyond the mission 18 in stations
 even a potato patch was sel until the spring of 1876 dom seen and a farm never 3 by the
 spring of 1876 newton had been in spite of the discouraging prospect be unable to find any suitable dwelling near
 fore him newton imtnniediately set to work the fort all others were occupied and his and by october 22 was
 able to write to present abode was far from satisfactory bishop maclean that he was holding serv he had incidentally
 found to add to his ices and sunday school he asked for what discomfort during the winter that no mahe

 a decision that was further sion house at 9 o clock divine service precipitated by the owner of his first

 noted that he required the house for his own use at 12 the horses are harnessed and to add to
 this the church authorities in i drive fast to fort saskatchewan where colonel jarvis and the mount formed newton that
 no money was availed police force are and hold service able for a dwelling or the land for it as

 miles stead and chose a location some seven the sunday evening is spent conversing with the men readying with them
 miles from n edmonton down the river where or doing anything which may arise he took up residence and constructed
 a to interest them in religious matters 5 small log house overlooking the river he newton also remarked in his
 letter to christened this the hcrmitage here he bishop maclean that he considered the settled and here he lived for
 the remainder church of england had at least a foothold of the years he spent in edmonton taking even though
 in his view the methodists up final residence in the house in decemwere working both fairly and unfairly to ber

 he ended his letter with paid a visit to edmonton and suggested to comiplaints about the high cost of living
 newton and some of the men of the infant flour cost from 20 to 30 for 100 pounds congrecation that
 it was time a church was he also asked bishop maclean to send built he noted on five boxes of
 books that he had left i had a good meeting at edmonton at fort garry yesterday when a church building
 newton s first winter at edmonton was committee was formed as you will see by dr newton s report i
 promised a miserable one the weather was often aid to the amount of 100 towards extremely cold and his dwelling
 was not the church 7 sufficiently well built to withstand it he on this optimiistic note bishop maclean had purchased
 a stove from the fort for had left edmonton immediately after the 100 but it was scarcely adequate to heat
 meeting had he remained for even a few the place he blamed what he term ned the minutes his optimism
 would have received light wood of the plains for this by which a rude jolt for as newton was to
 relate he meant ti ic poplar during the cold spells scarcely was the bishop out of earshot and he had
 to place the ink on the stove to sight when the chairman of the newlythaw when he wished to write
 and even formed committee turned to newton and then it would sonietinies freeze on his pen sarcastically asked him n
 before he touched the paper the house don t you suppose that i am going was drafty and this added
 to his discom to act as chaiman to a committee to build a church in such a country as fort
 frequently before holding services he this and without means that can be was obliged to shovel out snow that had
 depended upon who is to pay for drifted in through cracks in the ill con jt s structed building in
 spite of these setbacks newton s prompt retort was that if the he carried on at these temporary quarters chairman
 felt that way about building a 19 church he ought to have told the bishop and as he noted edmonton
 mission is then and there he further pointed out that about 25 niiles in extent including fort such an attitude
 was hardly fair either to saskatchewan the ‘ upper settlement ‘ fort the bishop or to himself however the edmonton

 as a result newton was soon able to re in his letters that his mission had 25 famport that ilies

 soon be realized 9 he was mi made a canon in 1883 he was in spite of newton s initial
 enthusiasm also known as the little doctor because the construction of the church took con of his doctorate and his
 short stature he siderably longer than contemplated due was just over five feet tall largely to lack of funds however
 with a one disadvantage that all saints had nearby sawmill closing down some lumber was that it stood apart from
 the village was available cheaply and the building was that was by 1 882 springing up near ti ic fort

 something towards maclean did not consider him n a particu it unfortunately both for the church larly outstanding n missionary
 he noted that and his own happiness he appears to newton preferred working with indians be entirely out of sympathy
 with at least many of the people there and and in a letter dated 12 noveniber 1880 i feel therefore

 suggested that newton go to an indian being circulated for his removal he remission as he preferred indian work while
 plied to the friend defending his conduct a younger man would con ic to edmonton as he related the petition
 was prepared it appeared that newton had replied that and sent around but he was informed by his health would
 not permit him n to go into a catholic churchman what the bishop termed a rough mission it came to
 inc but i took care to place he noted that newton had been absent it where it will give no
 more trouble to anybody 2 from his family who were still in ontario for over six years and canon newton
 s eccentricities had long been noticed by others as well as his con my own opinion is that it would
 be better for his own happiness to return gregation he had on one occasion been to ontario where he might
 be re haled into court for threatening one george united with his family and where he rath with a revolver
 in an incident over might obtain a sphere of labour free a land claiuii he was bound over to keep
 from the broils and troubles that seem to surround him from among the peace the people at edmonton ls by
 1 887 however his ways had become these broils and troubles as bishop too much for his congregation and repre
 maclean put it were one of the many semitations were ultimately made to ti ic problems with which newton had
 to con bishop by now william c pinkhamn tend that he had difficulties with his con bishop maclean having died
 in 1886 for gregation seen is to have been largely of his removal other matters were pressing his own n
 making william i i newton was an upon the bishop it was by no means easy irascible little mian set
 in his convictions to induce n men to come to isolated places and not always willing to see another s
 such as edmonton and it was not until point of view in his report of christmas 1891 that rev charles
