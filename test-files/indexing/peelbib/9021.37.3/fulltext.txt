 was many of andrew neighbours faced with the a widower in his early thirties with two children same dilemma had
 already left their homeland when he married seventeen year old eudocha to re settle in canada from them came rare
 let semenchuk in nizirna in 1895 twelve years ters indicating they had survived the transition later they had five children
 of their own all and were adjusting they wrote little if anything healthy and growing fast at that rate only
 god about their trials but extended invitations for knew how many more would come in the years others to join
 them in sharing canada s bounty ahead and how as parents they would be able of 160 acres for a
 paltry 10 to andrew it to provide for them andrew owned his own seemed to offer the solution he needed
 house but only eight acres of land already it in the spring of 1907 andrew sold his land was hard
 to imagine how he would be able to to his brothers the returns from the sale of the give his
 children a start in life even if the family land house and few head of livestock was did not increase
 in number looking ahead he had to admit they were all facing a life of the author a resident of
 edmonton has published diminishing returns if they stayed where they a number of articles in alberta history on early were
 it was imperative for theni to seek their pioneers above is a view of the edmonton immigration hall in 1911
 fortune elsewhere enough to cover the cost of the family s fare to it it was a horrendous blow because
 without their canada over and above all expenses andrew belongings they feared they were heading for had 175 left to
 give them a start in canada disaster embarking the s s montreal in hamburg as the train crawled west the
 children began they were on their way by the first week in june feeling somewhat better but were still far
 from with them they brought all their own personal well nights on the wooden train seats were cold belongings clothing
 footwear linen sheets pil and the children huddled together to keep warm lows and feather beds kitchenware and dishes ther
 e were no blankets nor extr a clothes to make plus everything else that could be useful they the sick
 youngsters more comfortable and no hot brought along a supply of precious seeds as well food to warm their insides
 as dark forests closed as tools and implements for cultivating the land in on them eudocha and andrew prayed if
 this making certain they had all the basic necessities was canada god help them all was a settler s guarantee
 in a new land they felt a measure of relief when they reached once at sea the ship began to
 pitch and roll winnipeg andrew went out and bought a few it did not help that they were billeted in
 the ship provisions and a couple of blankets to wrap hold along with a shipment of cattle as a result
 around the children who seemed to be failing the immigrants were soon bedridden with vio again they were all weary
 cold and longing lent sea sickness their misery was intensified for the trip to end by the darkness of their
 quarters and lack of fresh once again the train rolled heading westair all they could do was to lay on
 bunks which ward soon the topography of the land began were covered with straw and filled with vermin to change
 to the immigrants it looked mor e like each traveller had to bring his own bowl tin the steppes of
 home but the sight brought them cup and spoon but for the first few days no one little comfort how
 could they feel any joy when could eat the stink of vomit made the thought two of the children were
 deathly sick again of food doubly repulsive but after a few days when the train finally reached calgary it was
 the parents and the two older girls maria apparent that katrusia and nikola could not sur andrew s daughter by
 his first wife and lena vive further travel they needed to be placed in his daughter by eudocha regained their
 sea legs a hospital immediately the four younger children katrusia nikola during the stop over in calgary andrew luck paraska
 and joseph however failed to respond ily got into a conversation with a fellow coun they could not hold down
 their food they had tryman who owned a rooming house and made sore throats and they burned with fever it
 a point of meeting incoming trains in search during the long journey the health of the of prospective renters he
 listened as andrew youngsters deteriorated to the point where they explained the family predicament and begged were mere shadows of
 their former selves upon for help andrew promised the stranger he would reaching halifax the canadian health authori pay him
 for his trouble if only he would take ties ordered the entire family to be quarantined charge of the two
 children and place them in the and transferred them to an isolation hospital hospital moved by the tragic stor y
 the man located on an island off halifax agreed he would look after the children s broken hearted the parents
 were thoroughly interests until the father returned to pick them up bewildered by the turn of events while the he
 refused the offer of money saying andrew young mother wept for her sick children andrew needed it now more than
 he did instead andrew worried about their future in days following could pay the expenses when he came back for
 stress and anxiety took its toll they had no appe the children tite and couldn sleep finally when word came
 katrusia who was almost seven and nikola they were to be allowed to continue on their jour who was four
 were left in the stranger s care ney they could feel nothing but numbness this allowed the exhausted family to
 continue then as they were being taken to a westbound their journey to edmonton where they hoped old train they
 learned that their baggage was miss friends would help them out ing and no one seemed to know anything about
 the mandrusiaks arrived in edmonton early andrew s old neighbours he had come by wagon drawn by a team of
 oxen and agreed to take andrew and his family back with him if andrew and eudocha thought that the worst
 of their problems were over they would soon find otherwise they were packed and ready when magerowsky came to pick
 them up but when the supplies were piled into the wagon and the family climbed on board the vehicle was
 soon overcrowded the two sick children were made as comfortable as possible on a layer of hay but even so
 it did little to absorb the shock of steel rimmed wheels bumping over the rutted athabasca landing trail two days
 later they reached the magerowsky homestead and spent the night on a bed of hay on the floor in the
 man s hut next morning magerowsky showed them a small log shanty in t selve ‘ ears after arri ing
 in caiiada the laiidrusiak family posed for this photograph left to right are kate the yard which they could use
 until they were eudocha with anne on her lap nick in back who was ready to relocate born in the
 ukraine bill and andrew with josie on his that day andrew and eudocha chinked the lap log hut with clay
 and repaired the sod roof a pile of slough hay provided a bed and a length in july and immediately
 went to the immigra of log was used for sitting purposes but what tion hall where they would stay until
 andrew they needed most and didn t have was a stove could make arrangements to take them to their for
 cooking and for warmth too late andrew destination of waugh 40 miles north of the city realized his oversight in
 the meantime they while in edmonton andrew went shopping boiled water and cooked over an open fire in front for
 the barest necessities he bought some of the hut groceries second hand clothing a few pots and the days that
 followed were filled with a pans an axe saw and a shovel every cent dreadful sense of fear the little
 girl paraska counted at this stage and nothing was taken for and her baby brother were both failing fast they
 granted the last few dollars had to last them lay on their bed of hay staring into space too until
 andrew could find a job weak even to whimper the two other sick youngsters paraska and but even as the
 mother ministered to the two joseph were still not doing well and had to have sick children she never for
 a moment forgot to milk eudocha made them soup and coaxed them pray for the other two in calgary she
 hoped they to eat hoping to build up their strength before were better and for the sake of her troubled
 the last leg of their trip mind she could not afford to think otherwise among the strangers billeted at the
 immigra but how often did she ask herself is this god s tion hall were a few who spoke their
 tongue way of punishing us was it so wrong to want they watched the young mother hovering over a better
 life for the sake of the children her sickly children and began to ask questions back home in their village
 of nazirna they d upon hearing their story some were moved to had a snug whitewashed home and a sun
 baked tears but for the grace of god it could have been yard for the children to play in they
 had a cow any of them dipping into their own meagre and a garden and neighbours to lend a hand
 in supplies they contributed whatever they could times of need their food was plain but there was a short time
 later adam magerowsky came always enough to eat what she wouldn t give to edmonton to purchase some supplies he
 now to feel the comfort of her mother s arms homesteaded at waugh and knew many of it was as
 if an evil wind had snatched it all away leaving them bereft in this hard and foreign land she helped
 the popowichs to bring in the fish realizing their worst fears two weeks after and clean them in return they
 gave her all she arriving at waugh both children were dead needed to salt and dry for winter use then
 she they were among the first to be buried in the and the children went and picked mushrooms in new
 cemeter y beside the little log church the woods these too she dried with the eudocha s mind was blurred
 in the months that children s help she dragged home a supply of followed tears could not wash away the
 tern windfalls from the bush for winter fuel as well ble hurt as she slumped into fits of depression she
 harvested a supply of slough hay for their yet andrew could not afford to stay around any winter bedding longer
 if they were to survive the coming winter meanwhile andrew never gave up hope of he had to find work
 together with his daughter locating his lost baggage he knew its recovery maria who was fourteen years old he left
 for would provide a big boost to his flat pocketbook edmonton in search of jobs for both of them it
 would mean he could start homesteading on lena who was ten years old stayed to look after an even footing
 with other settlers by asking her ailing mother in later years not much was around while in edmonton he found
 a man who ever said how the two managed to survive that spoke ukrainian and claimed he could speak and
 summer but they made it perhaps the bounty of write in english for a fee this man began workthe surrounding
 woods helped ing on the case weeks went by then months when andrew returned for a visit he brought and
 still the baggage was missing finally in the with him a tin heater and a few groceries what spring of
 1908 a year after its disappearance money he had earned was needed for so many word came that the baggage
 at last had been different things among them the medical located in a warehouse in montreal expenses for the youngsters
 in calgary there communications between the man in edmonalso was the 10 fee to be paid for the homestead ton
 and the company in montreal took several and he was still trying to locate his lost baggage more weeks and
 when andrew finally made wherever he turned there was a hand open for arrangements for the baggage to be expressed
 to money edmonton it was too late the storage time had in this interval at home the family moved out
 expired and andrew s belongings had gone on from magerowsky s yard to another empty shed the auction block after
 all expenses were in sam popowich s yard sam an old neighbour deducted andrew received only 7 00 for all
 the from back home lived near the redwater river clothing kitchenware bedding and tools he had where he box trapped
 jackfish and suckers with carefully packed and brought to canada this this food source in mind andrew felt relieved was
 enough to break the will of about any man that his wife and daughter would have enough fate had dealt
 him a blow from which he never to eat while he was gone quite recovered while back in edmonton at
 work andrew in the spring of 1908 the mandrusiak family received word from calgary that his little boy had moved
 to their first shelter on their own homerecovered but katrusia had died sadly he went stead it was a stone
 s throw away from the to pick up the boy and to settle his debts that athabasca landing trail but
 other than that it had done he brought nikola home in time for winter little to commend it the whole
 waugh district he then left again this time to get a job as a was part of an area affected
 by glacial drift of teamster freighting goods between edmonton and thousands of years ago soil in the district varied athabasca
 from good to poor to very poor the better with her husband away most of the time homesteads were filled
 long before leaving only eudocha struggled to regain her health she knew the poorest ones unclaimed but knowing of the
 the children needed her support while he was tragedies which had happened to the family withgone leaving nikola in lena
 s care she went in the last year andrew did not choose to tempt looking for work among the settlers
 in return fate any further at least he would be close to she was given milk potatoes or whatever else
 people he already knew they could spare their home was a log shanty with a thatched roof it lacked a
 door and a glass window but covering the doorway eudocha knew she had andrew having a chance to get a
 ride to edmon to make the house liveable two miles north of ton to look for work left eudocha to
 finish it their homestead along the landing trail was every dollar earned would help them to meet a sawmill operated
 by a williams it was from their next biggest need a milk cow here eudocha dragged home lengths of cull
 lum meanwhile eudocha had not fully recovered ber for the door and for shelving her health and was still trying
 to recover from on one of these trips to the sawmill she found the loss of her three children when
 she learned a sheet of iron beside the trail she dragged it she was pregnant again now there would be
 home where it served as a stove top over a ciranother mouth to feed another child to clothe cle of
 rocks outside the door this was her cook and for what that was her bitter reaction so stove until they
 had a regular stove that the child could be snatched away from her that spring the mother with the help
 of her again if she had expected sympathy from her daughters dug a plot for a garden in return for
 husband she did not get it whether from ignor odd jobs her neighbour s gave her seeds a cluckance or
 from sheer frustration all he could say ing hen and a clutch of eggs sometimes a bit of was how
 nice for my wife to have another doll milk cottage cheese or a pail of potatoes ever y to play
 with the remark must have hurt dee little bit helped in summer they picked berries ply for she never forgot
 it and mushrooms left alone with the children with only a blanket view of the mandrusiak home after they settled
 in the waugh district north of edmonton in mid august eudocha gave birth to a little andrew s happiest day
 came when he sold his girl with mrs smerchenski attending as mid plodding oxen and bought a team of horses
 they wife the infant was strong and a survivor the were his pride and joy and he looked after them
 parents named her kate in remembrance of the with loving care they were a means of faster little girl who
 had died in calgary once again transportation he could hire out for cash for the task of looking after the
 baby and nikola fell hauling grain for harvesting and roadwork a on the shoulders of lena while eudocha carried farmer
 with a team of horses had a future withon with other jobs out them he was just a labourer for
 the first that fall andrew built a lean to to the hut and time since coming to canada andrew began
 to bought a cow how the family rejoiced in their feel he was on equal ground with his neighbours good
 fortune a good cow meant milk cream andrew never got rich in canada but he raised butter and cottage cheese
 all rich in protein the a family gave them a roof over their heads and cow was treated royally and
 fed only the choicest food on the table the children were strong and hay it was a surrogate mother who
 would keep healthy and of the six born in canada only one the wolf away from their door finally their
 luck died at the age of two having suffered injuries had changed from a fall they all attended school before
 going one year went by then another andrew now out in the world on their own he never could stayed
 home in summer to clear land and to break have done as much for them if he had remained it
 he put up fences and built log sheds in order in nazirna when he died shortly before reachto prove up
 the homestead he had to reside on ing the age of seventy he knew he had done the it at
 least three months of the year in three con best he could under the circumstances secutive years he had to
 break thirty acres of eudocha a widow at fifty five never remarland for a family starting with nothing it was
 ried she first lived with her son bill then later a big order his son was too young to help
 his with her daughter kate when she received her wife was expecting another baby old age pension she gained her
 independence in order to survive thirteen year old lena was and lived alone for many years only when she sent
 to work in edmonton as a mother s helper reached her eighties did she return to live with her five
 dollars a month went toward helping out kate to the end of her days she remained alert with expenses the
 money was needed for pay the matriach heading a family of five ing taxes buying seed grain and shingles for
 the generations new house andrew planned to build hoboes while there is luck in odd numbers it has always been
 conceded that thirteen is an unlucky number the truth of this saying was again borne out yesterday afternoon when thirteen
 unlucky hoboes wit h only 2 35 among the entire collection of dusty musty knights of the prairie roads were
 rounded up in east calgary they were all locked up in no 3 police station the fortune of 2 35
 was shared between jr botton and thomas regk the eleven others were clean they wer e living in empty shacks
 and had a large quantity of linen that was supposed to have been washed and hung out to dry in
 the eastern breeze when the police came down upon them pieces of bread and other unappetizing articles of food were
 found in their badly depleted larders an unfortunate combination of circumstances and dates seems to bid fair to work a
 complete hoodoo for the unlucky thirteen as they appear before the magistrate this morning which is the thirteenth day of

 involved in the creation of new business elites was an extraordinary homogeneity of origins on the edge of the western

 connection however since family community or financial linkages seem to have been inconsequential at v best both before and after
 arriving in wetaskiwin the same conclusion holds true for ontarians who chose to settle in wetaskiwin indeed the majority of
 businesses that had no island connection did poorly in the city and they remained rather transitory it might be argued
 that the wests the comptons and the montgomerys appeared to do so well because the others did so poorly in
 a comparative sense interestingly the homes of the latter group also reflect some basic differences with the islanders while built
 on a reasonably substantial scale most were simply elaborate versions of the prairie salt box design leading to a great

 husi essmen is tradi of alberta summer and fall the dividing line between summer and fall was very distinctively marked
 last week after two days rain the weat her cleared and showed the mountains and porcupine hills clothed in their
 winter garments the air in the evenings is now of that particularly cool and bracing nature which is a sure
 indication that our summer is past and we must prepare for winter severe frost at night and heavy mist in
 the early morning are the prominent features of the weather during the past week and a few light showers of
 rain have fallen after their r ecent period of barr en bar eness when only the mor e sombr e
 shade of the naked rocks was visible the mountains covered with pure white snow and bathed in sunlight raising their
 majestic and sparkling heights to pierce the transparent atmospher e or meet the lowering clouds which often hang above and
 around them are certainly a very grand and beautiful sight and far beyond the scope of any pen to picture
 they make a brilliant background to the green carpet of the prairie which lies stretched out at their feet and
 are a superb illustration of summer and winter in all their natural glor y and only separ ated by a
 few miles of level prairie and rolling hills fort maclead gazette sept 12 1884 growing up in alberta part one
 by charles h mckenzie prepared by diane mckenzie this is the first in a series of three articles on the
 life of dr char es h mckenzie he was born in watford ontario in 1897 and moved to the okotoks
 high river area where these reminiscences begin after receiving his medical degree from the university of alberta where the third
 section of the reminiscences end he practised in the coal branch area of western alberta his experiences there were the
 subject of an article doctor in the coal branch published in the spring 1985 issue of alberta history he then
 moved to saskatchewan and an account of his experiences there was published under the title reminiscences of dr charles mcketizie
 in saskatchewan history spring 1985 dr mckenzie moved to minneapolis where he practised gynecology and obstetrics for thirty years he
 died in 1980 these reminiscences were prepared by his daughter based on dr mckenzie ‘ s writings our family left
 watford ontario for the i am sure i wore out three or four soles on my great west in the
 early spring of 1906 when i was left shoe which was both propeller and brake a eight years old and
 my brother george was six few other boys had wagons too but we were sure we had been talking about
 the west ever since our s was the best because it came from the west mother s brother uncle dick
 moore and grand well the money for it had come from the west father moore had gone west and homesteaded
 in and we worked hard to keep it well greased and alberta in 1901 during the summer of 1904 spotlessly
 clean father had a chance to work for deering in father returned late that fall ready t move to calgar
 y when he returned in the fall he was full alberta he had been promised ajob as the engine of
 enthusiasm and determined to move out west expert for deering if he would attend school for after receiving extra training
 in chicago father three months so in january 1906 he went to muwas sent back west for the summer of
 1905 to waukee to learn all about gasoline engines and be the expert on deering farm machinery in tractors by
 the time he finished school deering southern alberta in those days most farm and other farm implement fi rms had
 amalgamated machiner y could be mended with a pair of pliers and father was working for the new international and
 a piece of baling wire but father was the one harvester company who could set the timing mechanisms on the
 that spring we loaded our household effects engines or the knotter on the binders or set the into a freight
 car and set out by tourist train for blade on the mowers father wrote home glow calgar y george and
 i were terribly excited and ing reports about the west and about his work there was so much to see
 and do that we were back in watfonl we were also enthusiastic about never bored we didn t care that
 the coaches were father s work he was making more money than crowded at every stop even the briefest we
 he ever had in his life he was even able to send jumped out and ran up and down the
 long line enough money to buy a toy wagon for george and of cars about twice a day the trained
 stopped for me i used to pump the wagon up and down the half an hour so the passengers could
 get out and cement sidewalk while george sat in the back eat at the station restaurant we couldn t afford
 bodies of animals along the north side of the railroad tracks all the 180 miles from medicine hat to calgary
 it was a terrible sight we did not know it then but the hard winter and the impact of a
 ll the new people moving west to buy land and establish farms had heralded the death of the free r
 angeland in calgar y we moved into a house on 4 th avenue west a nd that summer the most
 memorable event for us was gr andpa moor e s drive grandpa was a fine horseman and enjoyed breaking and
 training horses and cr eating the perfect team he lived with uncle dick and aunt belle aon their ranch south
 west of calgary one morning he hitched up his team put oats and hay in he buggy and drove all
 the way to calgary a distance of forty miles he stayed the day and drove home again it was the
 talk of the countryside eighty miles in one day the author as photographed in watford ontario tsso mother didn t
 like living in calgary because she years before he came with his family to alberta had no place for a
 ganien or for chickens or a cow to eat at the restaurants but would run across to so we moved
 to okotoks twenty five miles south and r ented a big square house with a large yard the town and
 buy food at the store cooking was and a barn we had a cow and she gave enough quite a
 problem there was only one coal burning milk for george and me and sometimes there was heater in one car
 and ever yone tried to use if for even enough cream to make a small pat of butter heating water
 or making meals we also had a large garden and for a time we at whitefish bay along he north
 shore of lake had some chickens superior the train stopped and as usual george life in a small town was
 much more interestand i got off the train was stopped for a long ing for two small boys than life
 in the city george time there was a faulty coupling between our car and i had many playmates and we
 r oamed all and the one behind ours a large group of pas over one of our favourite places was
 the mill sengers gathered to watch as the cars were pond where we sailed boats and skipped stones uncoupled and
 moved apart about eighteen inches and tried to walk logs john lineham used to float george and i were right
 in front watching as a logs each spring from the foothills down to his mill we made friends with the
 men who worked workman crawled between the coupling joint and there and often watched as the logs went up the
 began hammering suddenly there was a bump jackladder and finally were sawed into lumber as a new engine was added
 on ahead the cars the mill was run by a large steam engine whose jerked back catching the workman s
 head between boiler burned sawdust the coupling plates someone had to run the full father was travelling for international thirteen
 car lengths to tell the engineer to pull harvester selling farm machiner y all summer and ahead and as the
 cars moved apart the work tr ying to collect for it all winter he was away man s body dropped
 to the ground it was the first all week but when he got home saturday night death i had ever
 seen george and i always went to meet him as he got the train continued on across canada finally of
 f the tr ain we arrived early at the station so we could watch the train come in before it
 we arrived at medicine hat and mother told us we were in the great west it was late march and
 arrived the porters from the three hotels tried to place their buses in the most advantageous posiwe began to see
 the grisly results of the winter tion to catch the eye of any traveller who might of 1905 06 the
 coldest in years there had been arrive as soon as the train stopped the porters more snow than usual and
 long cold periods with all started calling and shouting grand central no chinooks hundreds of cattle sheep and hotel roya
 l hotel alberta hotel what horses froze to death on the prairies we saw the a racket they made competition
 was keen school in alberta was an interesting experience my life i was able to draw a map of europe
 from for us i was in the third reader and miss gries memory finally i did the same as the
 r est of the bach was my teacher she was a crusading old class and put up my geogr aphy
 book with a book maid and a fine teacher everything worked on inside of it to read a competitive basis
 we stood in line to recite or such stories there were to read the most popuspell or do problems if
 we missed we went down lar were the horatio alger books frank and one place but if we were at
 the head of the line fearless strong and steady brave and bold and and missed we went to the foot
 of the line and many more they all had the same basic theme had to start working our way up
 all over again poor boy goes to the city meets cr ook over comes usually i was able to keep
 at or near the head crook after many difficulties and becomes of the line wea lthy and famous i am
 sure i read every book miss griesbach was a fanatic about cigarettes in the series several times there were also
 and formed the anti cigarette league we all volumes of frederick manyat s masterman ready signed a pledge not to
 smoke cigarettes and every and best of all the a g henty books his stories day we gave the yell
 were full of action or mystery and took place in ot her countries or in historical settings henty was anti
 cigarette anti cigarette by far my favourite and the best of all his books we will never smoke you bet
 watch us grow up strong and bright was rujub the juggler a story of india i read anti cigarette league
 it s all right it over and over all the class read these books occasionally mr skinner would sneak up
 and we had a badge to wear a small button that find us all reading alger books behind our geogattached
 to our collar s or coats with the letters raphies then he would slash right and left with acl we
 persuaded father who had never his hickory pointer confiscate the alger books smoked in all his life to wear one
 he told ever y until the next morning and we would all start one that acl stood for a cheerful
 liar drawing the map of europe again among the boys in the school there were some the best part of
 living in the west was uncle backsliders sim was the greatest offender his dick s ranch uncle dick had homesteaded
 near older brothers teased him about not smoking and tongue creek some years before and shortly nearly every monday morning
 when miss gries thereafter had married belle valiance tongue bach asked if anyone had smoked poor sim creek pronounced crik
 was a beautiful little shamefully raised his hand she made quite a stream rising in he foothills to the west
 and flowceremony of having him sign the pledge again ing east to empty into the highwood river then we would
 all give our yell of encouragement uncle dick had been one of the earliest settlers once more in the area
 he found 160 acres on the north bank anti cigarette anti cigarette of he creek hirteen miles south west of
 okotoks we will never smoke you bet where he homesteaded building a house about watch us grow up strong and
 bright four hundred yards from the creek on the top of anti cigarette league it s all right the bank
 grandpa moore homesteaded the quarter the next year i graduated to mr skinner s section directly north and uncle dick
 was able class he was the principal and taught not only to acquire the additional quarter sections adjoinmy class the
 fourth reader but all the high ing both pieces of property by 1909 he owned a full section of land
 school with about five students in each grade he spent most of his time and energy on the high the
 area was settled quickly in the first three school so he gave us mostly seatwork first thing years of this
 century and soon uncle dick had in the morning he always gave us a lot of addi a number of
 neighbours to the east were dave tion and multiplication which he never corrected morrison jack mcintyre and the lund brothers

 members of the class just used the same at easter 1907 we took our first trip to uncle map day
 after day but for a long time i religiously dick s ranch we were excited especially because drew a map
 of europe every day complete with we had been promised a horseback ride uncle countries rivers oceans bays and straits
 and all dick had a little indian pony called daisy and view of high river as it appeared about the
 time the mckenzies arrived i was ver y anxious to ride her he placed me it would have been faster
 to walk astride and gave me the reins i had seen others once a week on saturdays i was allowed
 to ride horses and wanted to show off i kicked her put uncle dick s big saddle on billy and
 go for with my heels and slapped her with the reins she the meat at the meat ring during the
 summer immediately started off at a gentle lope and after months before refrigeration it was difficult to keep three strides
 i fell off nothing was hurt but my meat fresh when a family slaughtered an animal feelings but i cried
 and stormed uncle dick then they couldn t eat all the meat before it spoiled so put george who was
 three and one half years they often passed the meat around among the younger than me on daisy he promptly
 fell off neighbours eventually sixteen families decided too so i was pacified that was my first horse to contribute an
 animal a week by turns for slaughback ride but during the following summers both ter the meat was divided and
 each family had george and i spent much of our time on fresh meat each week all summer one of
 the horseback neighbours had been a butcher back east and he every summer mother george and i went out of
 fered his services in return for a share of the to uncle dick s as soon as school was out
 in june meat thus a meat ring was started the butcher and stayed until september those summers were slaughtered on
 friday and cut up the meat then the happiest times of my life we roamed every he hung it to
 cool overnight on a twelve foot where we explored the creek we found bird s wheel on the top of
 his granary for a long time nests coyote burrows and even saw a bobcat up george and i thought this
 big wheel was the meat in a tree most of all we rode horseback uncle ring on saturdays it took
 us nearly all day to dick had old daisy for george and bought another go the six miles and back
 to fetch the meat pony called billy for me he was the best pony because with nearly forty extra bulky
 pounds on i ever had he could run fast he was gentle he the saddle we could go no faster
 than a walk would let me open a gate without dismounting soon after homesteading dave morrison had and he was
 also a fine cattle pony and could cut given a corner of his land as a site to build the
 out calves we always rode bareback if we fell tongue creek hall for meetings dances and off we had to
 lead our ponies to a fence corner church on sundays all the neighbours contributed to find a post to climb
 so we could remount we time labour and money it was a lively neighwere pretty careful riot to fall off
 bourhood and dances wer e f r equent with square george and i went everywhere on horseback dancing three steps

 his we all believed that it was a world record crops he had one hired man and maggie lund uncle
 dick had been a baker back east so he came down to cook and keep house until mother ran the
 food booth that sold ice cream candy could move out to the ranch with us after school sandwiches desserts and
 coffee it was a big job was finished the summer was particularly hot to turn the ice cream freezer in
 the shade of the and dry and the crops did not do well by early north side of the hall
 we all took turns august all the crops were short and beginning to after the picnic the night was spent
 dancing ripen almost a month early on august 10 five the babies were rolled in the corner and some of
 us were standing in the open barn door watchof the women watched them while making coffee ing a storm cloud
 in the southeast uncle dick in a washboiler usually everyone ate at midnig ht was ther e father the hired
 man george and i and then danced again until 5 00 am liquor was that s hail said uncle dick
 i can tell by banned from the picnic and dance and the picnic the white edge of the clouds committee
 enforced the rule he was right in a few minutes the storm struck uncle dick paid us one cent for
 every gopher those were the largest hailstones i have ever seen we caught we set ingenious traps but when we
 from walnut to orange size the storm lasted caught a chicken aunt belle ruled that there could unusually long at
 least twenty minutes on the be no traps near the house or coop after that we dry ground the hailstones
 bounced four or five used snares for catching gopher s near the house feet when the storm passed hail cover
 ed the and in he garden we put a noose carefully around ground and uncle dick s crop was a
 total loss the gopher hole led the str ing back five or six he was completely discouraged no crop no
 feet and then sat quietly when a gopher stuck feed no time left for a second growth he offered his
 head above ground jerk we had a gopher father half the next year s crop if would farm the about
 once a week uncle dick put poisoned place for a year with our family living on the wheat down the
 gopher holes in the garden i am ranch until all the 1911 crop was hauled to the elesure his method
 got rid of mor e gophers than ours vators after some discussion father accepted did but we always considered it
 an unfair way for he too was tired of his lot after five years to do us out of pennies
 as a commercial traveller george and i were over one year we also made money picking up nails joyed to
 think we would be really living on the dropped by the carpenters who built the barn in ranch the summer
 of 1909 uncle dick paid us one by the time school started that fall uncle dick penny for every hundred
 nails we found i believe and valiance had left for watford ontario and we made twenty five cents that summer
 we lived on the r anch from the fall of 1910 until the saddest event in our lives occurred while
 the spring of 1912 it was a wonderful although we were living in okotoks in 1909 our aunt belle sometimes
 difficult experience father had died uncle dick s wife was a roly poly cheer always been a hustler and he
 started every enterful person she and dick were both in their thir prise he could think of to make money
 he bought ties when they married her first pregnancy had weaner pigs to raise he cut posts from the willows
 ended in a premature still born but in 1909 she along the creek and sold them he weaned all the
 became pregnant again the baby was due in early calves that were still running with their mothers december so she

 to be near her physician dr ing mother bought extr a chickens hoping they murray she delivered a baby boy
 on december would lay eggs all winter george and i worked 7 1909 and we were all very happy and
 proud too we took on the job of school janitor sweep but aunt belle didn t recover well she gradually
 ing out the school building and making the fire grew worse and died about ten days later in se in
 the mornings father planned to make that vere agony no one ever talked about her death r anch pay all
 it could for the next year uncle dick was overwhelmed i don t believe i was in grade 8 and
 george was in grade 4 and the cremation of sam mcgee mother had a famous recitation about a man who
 did his duty whatever may come that always produced applause and handerchiefs there were also geography contests history contests and
 spelling contests we were very proud of mother because she could always outspell everybody we wouldn t have m issed
 a meeting for anything and several times there were full meetings when it was 40 degr ees below zero outside
 dave morrison on the next farm east had an amazing idea that winter he purchased a big tenhor sepower gasoline
 engine then he hauled gasoline in big drums from the nearby turner valley oil fields to run the engine dave
 used the engine to drive a grain chopper and chopped grain for all the neighbours we were all impressed with
 such a time saving invention this was before the dingman well stuck oil and started the oil boom in the
 turner valley in 1914 but ther e were a lready small wells and surface oil the gasoline 4 came right
 from the source without refining and ‘ it sure made that old engine purr and ping it was a happy
 winter everybody was in the ‘ i he author at right itli his ‘ ounger brother george a year after
 their arrival in the west same condition broke but we were a cohesive group hat worked together and helped each
 other alberta schools officially changed from standards later during the war years the farmers along to grades in 1912 but
 our little country school tongue creek became mor e prosper ous but then was already using the grade system in
 1910 we bitter animosities broke out that disrupted the rode horseback to school two miles north and community one and
 a half miles west being the school jani when spring came father had everything tor was fun while the weather
 was good we liked ready all the machinery was repaired oiled and sweeping and dusting the school and starting the
 greased the horses had been stalled long enough fires on the cool mornings in september and to be in good
 condition the farm buildings were october later when the snow came and the fixed a nd in good repair father
 decided that i was northwest wind blew against us all the way to old enough to be the hired man
 so i had to miss school we wer e so cold we could hardly hold a school while we harrowed
 and sowed the fields match to start the fire and it wasn t so much fun to oats barley and
 wheat part of the land we on the coldest days when the temperature went simple disced and sowed to early
 oats the rest lower than 30 degrees below zero father would i tilled using four horses with a plow turning
 two drive us in the sleigh but most of the time we twelve inch furrows it was slow work plowing
 rode on our own ponies we missed only three but there was a lot of satisfaction watching the days of
 school all year and that was after we froze black earth turn into neat furrows occasionally our cheeks noses and
 ear s on the way home one i added another team and pulled a harr ow but six cold night
 horses was r eally more than i could handle easi that winter father organized the tongue creek ly usually after
 i had twenty or thirty acres literary society with jack mcintyre as president plowed father would hitch up six horses
 abreast jack had been a school teacher back east the to the harrow and make short work of smoothing society
 met in the homes of the members about the land for the seeder he had a long pole attwo times
 a month each member was supposed tached to the crossbar of the harrow fitted with to contribute in some way
 father always sang two twenty four inch iron wheels this made a a scottish ballad as did jessie mctavish the
 cart where he could stand and and drive but it mcwilliams boys recited poems and i heard for wasn t
 high enough to keep him out of the dust the first time the shooting of dan mcgrew as soon as
 a piece of land was harrowed he put the seeder on it our seeder was only a six amount of
 straw by late august our barley was teen marker and he average seeding per day was ripe and cut and
 stooked it was a bumper crop one acre per marker this was too slow for father the oats kept on
 growing and growing especially he had the horses in good condition and by push on the fifty acres east of
 the barn in early ing the team and himself was able to seed twenty september the heads began to turn
 so we started acres on many days we put in approximately 250 cutting oats as the binder went down the
 field acr es of oats sixty acres of barley and ten acres all we could see were the horses ear
 s and the top of spring wheat we were still planting a variety of the revolving wheels of the machinery
 that of wheat called red fife that matured in about grain was over six feet high i have never since
 115 days seen such tall grain by the third week in besides the work in the fields we had chores
 september we had about one hundred acres cut to do we got up early fed groomed and har and stooked
 nessed eight or ten horses cleaned the barns it was an election year and sir wilfrid laurier milked the cows
 fed pigs pumped water for the and the liber als staked their chances on a stock and carried water and
 wood into the house reciprocity trade agreement with the united states for the day in the evening we had to
 unharness the conservatives cr y was annexation we the horses feed and groom them and wash down will be just
 another state september 22 was their sore shoulders before bedding them then election day and at midnight a snowstorm struck
 we m ilked cleaned and fed the cows fed the pigs from the north west and blanketed all of alberta
 and pumped water after this we had to treat the with about a foot of snow down went the last
 seed for he next day s sowing this meant spnnk fifty acres of our beautiful oats the oats arc just
 ling formalin solution on about sixty bushels of like the liberals said father snowed under oats as we turned the
 grain over and over with by a hugh majority a big scoop we did this daily to kill the spores
 in a few days the snow disappeared but there of oat diseases just prior to planting in the morn lay
 our fifty acres of oats east of the barn father ing we shoveled the tr eated oats into bags for
 wasn t daunted he rigged up some long fingers easier handling in the fields and stacked the bags on the
 front of the binder to raise the fallen crop into the wagon box the days were long from it wasn
 t a ver y successful manoeuvre but he did 5 00 am until 9 00 pm we finished planting at
 manage to retrieve about one third of the crop noon on may 5 1911 and after a month at top
 which was he pointed out a better comeback than speed father mother george and i were all the liberals could
 boast of tired it was time for the threshers and that year fin most of the neighbours took time out
 as soon creighton threshed for us he had the biggest rig as the crops were in but not father he
 was out in the county a 49 60 case separator a big case again the next morning with the harrow
 to catch tractor and his own cook wagon and bunk wagas many of the early weeds as possible before the
 ons what a sight it was to see his outfit arrive grain came through the ground we harrowed over at
 the ranch the big steam tr actor was like an 200 acres in the next week or so by that
 time engine pulling a train with the separator bunk the ground was warm enough to start potatoes cars chuck wagon
 water wagon coal truck and father had arranged to sell john lineham pota all the other wagons and equipment fir
 st the tr ain toes at twenty five cents a bushel for his two drove through the yard and dropped
 off the bunk lumber camps we cut potatoes and cut potatoes wagons and chuck wagon then away to the first
 nd pla nted several acres in old straw bottoms the granary fin already had had holes dug for the sites
 of strawstacks around which the stock had separator wheels to fit into so the engineer swung eaten all winter around
 and dr opped the separ ator in place the father continued working around the r anch spike pitcher s unr
 olled the belt and the tr actor fencing repairing putting in a vegetable garden swung around to drop the separator
 the belt was and so on but i went back to school after miss snapped on and with a toot
 toot of the whistle ing about six weeks in late june i wrote exams threshing began twelve bundle wagons loaded
 and was fortunate to pass into grade 9 and hauled the bundles or sheaves of grain from usually oats ripened
 in alberta in 120 to 140 the fields to the separator two men on each days barley in 100 days
 and wheat in 110 to 120 wagon laid the bundles on the feeder heads fir st days but 1911 was
 a wet year and the moisture so that the head covered the butt of the preceding coupled with no crop
 the year before made the bundle in no time the stacker was pouring out oats and barley stool out early
 and grow a large straw and the automatic weigher let the grain come ing top to give extra space so
 that a tank eleven feet long the usual length held 150 bushels of c most of the farmers had tank
 boxes with a flaroats however the tanks were top heavy and it was common for them to tip over especially
 on was nearly a total loss father had a different idea the hills when that happened the load of grain
 he built a box fourteen feet long with straight sides which also held 150 bushels it wasn t top heavy
 but it was so long that it was difficult to handle on slippery roads and the rear end wouldn t
 follow well it was also a job to load shoveling grain that extra three feet to the front of the
 tank was a lot of extra work moreover the fourteen foot box could barely get in the ele vator dump
 in spite of the disadvantages father was able to haul 10 000 bushels of grain with only 4 one accident
 in which he lost about half his load every morning he was up early and away with ‘ four horses
 to his long box it took an hour to load ‘ ‘ four and a half hours on the road
 to okotoks oneand a half hours to unload feed the hor ses and j have lunch and then four hours
 back home j eleven hours for one load he had to make about ‘ t seventy trips and the days
 were beginnning to ‘ lengthen again before he finished hauling uncle dick and i did the chores we were milking
 about the author s father hugh f mckenzie came to alberta ten cows and feeding nealy one hundred hogs in
 1906 as a farm implement salesman and later went into father worked hard that year to earn one cent farming
 a pound for oats and barley twenty five cents a bushel for potatoes and twenty five cents a pound pouring
 down into the granary in a heavy yield for butter if anyone complained he would remind such as we had
 that year the granary was full them that the fourth commandment says that for about 1 000 bushels per granary
 in about four six days shalt thou labour and do work before resthours and the train moved on to the
 next granary ing on the seventh the threshers worked twenty four hours a day after the harvest father went back
 on the road using two crews the day crew got up at 6 00 selling windmills and gasoline engines for
 goold am and had br eakfast hitched up the wagons and shapely and muir he had all of southern alberta
 were in the fields at 7 00 am they worked until for his territory and made a fairly good living
 even 6 00 pm with an hour off at noon dinner was during the recession of the next three years
 he at 7 00 pm and then they went to sleep in the purchased a model t ford to haul
 his gear and bunk cars the night crew got up at 6 00 pm had put up dozens maybe even
 hundreds of windbr eakfast and wer e r eady to start work at 7 00 pm mills he came to
 know most of the farmers in they worked all night with an hour off at mid the district and made
 a lot of friends night they threshed a lot of gr ain and were at our family moved into a
 brand new house in our ranch for about three days high river which father had planned himself it we now
 had 10 000 bushels of oats and barley was comfortable with a large kitchen a dining in the granaries it
 was a fine crop sixty bushels r oom a living room and three bedrooms father of barley to the acre
 and over one hundred bushels had also put in the pipes and left spaces for sinks of oats per acr
 e in the fields cut before the a bat htub and toilet and had the whole house wired snowstorm when
 uncle dick returned he was for electricity but these luxuries came later ama zed his r anch had never yielded
 such a crop ther e was an acr e of gr ound around the house now the crop had to
 be hauled thirteen miles that spring it was plowed and put into garden over hilly dirt roads to the elevators
 in okotoks mostly potatoes which george and i had to hoe once a week on saturdays and holidays father dr
 r e buswell came out from high river george and i built a small barn and a hen house and
 set the fracture i had a big heavy plaster cast mother had to have a cow and some chickens from
 fingers to axilla for the next month that george and i begged for a pony and finally ended my haying
 and most of my harvesting i father bought us a light buggy and a little white was only able to
 do a few things such as tr amp pony named whitey george and i could shoot hay and since i
 had hoped to drive the team it gophers right from the buggy with our single shot was quite a come
 down to end up tramping hay 22 rifle and whitey never minded a bit like a boy by the summer
 of 1912 i was nearly fifteen and that fall i was in grade 10 and went to the new expected
 to help uncle dick quite a lot my first high school on the west side of town i walked job
 was raking hay a slow process uncle dick to school with smitty who lived next door east gave me his
 slowest old mares lucy and bessie and charlie arnold who lived west on the bank for a team it was
 not a glamorous task on the of little bow creek school hours were from 9 00 last day of raking
 i decided to step things up a to noon and from 1 30 to 4 00 so we had lots
 bit remembering how father had raced through of time to come home for dinner all fall and the the slowest
 of task the year before i cut a switch next spring our high school played lacrosse and tapped old lucy
 and bessie on their broad smitty charlie and i practised all the way to and rumps soon we were raking
 hay at high speed from school in the morning at noon and in the as a result i finished up
 quickly and came proud afternoon we practised at recess too we were ly parading down the road to the barn
 at a smart pretty good and our whole high school team trot holding my switch in the air but mother
 al played well but none of the surrounding towns ways said the more haste the less speed played lacrosse so
 we had no competitors they as i swung my smartly stepping team through the all played baseball gate the right
 wheel of the rake hit the gatepost the next year we switched to baseball we three and the tongue broke
 thr owing me down behind played all the way to and from school again the old mar es heels when
 i came to i was nelson fraser who rode in from the country and bleeding from the left ear and
 my left arm was stabled his horse near our place usually played broken at the wrist with us in the
 spring we organized a school base st in 1914 the mckenzie family moved to calgary so that charles could receive
 a grade 12 education at central collegiate seen here in the background the boy had graduated from grade 11 with
 the highest marks in alberta ball team i was the captain and played first base was born she had already
 begun planning that i but we were no match for nanton or okotoks was going to be a teacher besides
 where would our biggest rivals they beat us at every game we the money come from for housing and meals
 and consoled ourselves by boasting hat we could beat books no i could not possibly attend university them at lacrosse
 there was no grade 12 in high river after there was more to grade 11 than baseball it much discussion
 mother and father decided to was a critical year for me academically i had two move to calgary so i
 could attend school there excellent teachers mr liggett and miss carr when i finished i could go on to normal
 school hey were able to teach students how to love learn in calgary and still live at home another two
 ing and how to enjoy working hard year s thus after another summer on uncle and then that winter dr
 marshall tory came dick s ranch we found a house in calgary near to speak an event that had more
 bearing on my the central collegiate institute and i was ready future than any other single thing dr tory was
 to start grade 12 it was september 1914 and the president of the university of alberta in world war i
 had started but our lives were not edmonton during 1913 and 1914 he travelled all yet affected over the province
 lecturing promoting college school went well for me i studied latin education and telling people about the new univer english
 literature composition physics alsity that had been created in 1908 the first class gebra and trigonometry i particularly enjoyed had
 just graduated thirteen men and five reading cicero in latin and the marvelous algebra women i went to hear him
 talk at the town hall and trigonometry demonstrations by the in high river he was an excellent speaker and mathematics
 teacher mr stanley i gr aduated put forth many arguments in favour of a univer with the highest marks in
 the class and received sity education but one argument really struck me thr ee books as a prize the poems
 of tennyson he proved to my satisfaction that every day i went wadsworth and kipling to school would be worth
 10 to me in my future i m afraid i thought i was pretty wise hadn t life i m
 not sure why this reasoning appealed to i been the smartest boy in alberta in grade 11 me so much
 possibly because we had always and the smartest in calgary in grade 12 nobody been poor or maybe it was
 only my scot blood could tell me anything father and mother knew but that day i resolved that i would
 go to the nothing of course they had only gone as far as university grade 6 our exams came late
 in june all exam papers on top of all this smartness i got religion the for the province of alberta
 were corrected in ymca put on a big revival and george and i edmonton so it was july before the
 results were attended george wasn t impressed he always had available i was notified that i had passed grade more
 common sense that i did but i became 11 with the highest mark in the province in highly emotional about
 religion and continued to addition i was offered a four year scholarship to be ver y pious for the next
 three years this left the university of alberta me completely devoid of a sense of humour i was sixteen years
 old and would not be seven laughter was irreligious i believed and i teen for two more months father and
 mother just preferred to pray rather than laugh looking back could not allow me to go away to university at
 i realize that i was very immature much more such a young age anyway mother was deter so than the
 average boy of seventeen when the mined that i should be a school teacher all her cruel world hit me
 i cr awled into a religious shell life she had wanted to be a teacher even though pulled my scholastic
 achievements over the door she had to stop school to help at home when i and glower ed at the
 wicked world to be continued joke on north country a familiar story comes from the lesser slave lake country in
 a remote section all of the people have moved out of a school district excepting one family the father and
 two sons have elected themselves as dir ector s and employed the mother who holds a certificate to teach the
 only pupil is the little girl in the family the directors have voted to hold school in the fa mily

 that three years for twenty five cents was and cut sonic tobacco and when i walked up the too long
 and that great falls mont was a good track the crowd ran for the station expecting to place to be
 i hurried into my outdoor clothes and catch me there if i should board the train before going to a
 restaurant i ordered three sandwiches it had stopped while i was up the track a man in a hurry i
 got them after considerable delay and left the crowd and picking up a car spring in each then struck out
 down an alley past the building hand he came toward me when he got near i in which conybeare was
 drawing the information asked him if those people thought i was cashel against me and continued towards the united he
 replied they did and he had volunteered to size states it was dark then and suddenly i ran upon me
 up a building with two flags over it that i took for ‘ your face looks familiar to me he
 said and a police post on hands and knees i crawled past then he dropped his weapons and stuck out
 his it since i have learned that it is a smallpox pest hand i had known him years ago at
 the stnelter house and that no one had been in it for six and i tell you i was mighty
 glad to see him he months went back and told the crowd he knew me that i struck the railroad
 track south and until mid i was not cashel and when the train pulled in night i walked along the
 track i had not had sup and i found there was not a policeman on board per but got outside
 of two of those dry bread and i got into a box car and rode to brunton twentyham sandwiches and
 continued to walk until i five miles further there they stopped for water reached stirling nineteen miles from lethbridge and
 when i peeked out i saw a policeman walk there i roused the operator told him i was a hun
 ing along the train and then he boarded the train that settled my riding at once i realized that i
 was surrounded by wolves about a mile out of brunton while the train there were twelve or fifteen in the
 pack on all was running pretty fast i dropped from my car sides of me and closing in i had
 plenty of matches into a culvert and after turning a couple of somer and setting fire to the tuft of
 grass i carried i made saults was on my feet i was still twenty two miles a swinging torch of
 that and those wolves i from the line but i could see the sweet grass hills believe are running yet
 in the distance and thinking they were about i had all day long been without water and the twenty five
 miles away i struck out for them i snow i had eaten had increased my thirst i knew will swear
 now they are seventy five miles from i was headed toward milk river but it seemed brunton it was about
 9 30 in the morning when i would never get there at last when i felt i could i began
 my walk to the hills and all that day i go no further i reached the east bank of the
 saw not a soul and the only thing i had to eat stream and it was fifty feet down to
 water the was snowba lls some of the snow i picked up had snow had piled high against the east
 bank and weeds in it and the seeds had tainted the snow when i went over i struck the snow
 fell and slid and it was a mighty slim and disagr eeable diet for on my belly clear across the
 river above me i a hunted footsore hungr y man lost in a could hear running water and below a
 few yards wilderness was an air hole but i was lucky enough to strike when night came i saw the
 sweet grass hills the solid ice still far distant all day long i had trudged over picking myself up after
 the slide across the the prairie and had not seen a stick of wood after ice i went to open
 water and dr ank until i could dark i wanted some kind of weapon and twist hold no more i
 was never before so thirsty and ing a long tuft of grass i carried that with me it almost made
 myself sick by drinking was lucky that i had done so for a few minutes i was almost lost and
 i gave up the attempt later my tired eyes saw objects skulking near and to reach the sweet grass hills
 knowing that i c n green veered east of coutts station seen here about 1900 to avoid police patrols searching
 for him after his flight from lethbridge would soon play out i did not know the points ers that no
 policeman should smoke while on duty of the compass but i knew the wind had been from and also advised
 him to order his men to quit makhe west and i went against the wind at midnight ing cracks that
 c n green could not get away i struck the railroad at mile post 143 i had walked from them
 3 for fifteen hours and had gained only fourteen for two days after i reached sweet grass i miles from
 brunton and i was still nine miles from could not put on my shoes my legs were sore the boundary
 and cramped and my tongue and lips were i could not stop and i resumed my journey parched but after
 i was able to get around i saw along he railroad about two o clock in the morn many old
 friends and i talked to them of the ing when about four miles from the boundary i scenery of that
 region was startled by seeing a shower of sparks blow ‘ you men living here looking upon those ing across
 the track a short distance ahead of me hills every day may consider them bleak barren and i knew that
 i had almost run into an outpost and desolate i told them ‘ but to me the sweet of police
 and that the sparks were from a sentry s grass hifis are the most beautiful scenery that god pipe that
 frightened me and i left the track and has ever made veered to the east thr ough the night i
 strained since getting home i have learned that the my eyes to keep the telegraph poles in sight but police
 confiscated all my clothes drawing tools i kept at least a mile from the railroad pretty soon and other effects
 i wrote for them and got no i could see the lights at the police barracks at the satisfaction and
 when mounted policemen were line and fearing they might have dogs there i here saturday looking for cashel i went
