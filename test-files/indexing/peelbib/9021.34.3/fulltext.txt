 is 1988 3 rd month or march 1988 a naturalist at jasper by hugh a dempsey in 1895 a young
 biologist named john alden tion was important in the field of agriculture as loring began a two year study of
 the natural it affected the control or eradication of undesirhistoiy of the region near jasper house in the able species
 canadian rockies an american employed by as a result in 1889 the u s department of the united states department
 of agriculture his agriculture established the bureau of biological role was not so much one of a scientist seeking survey
 and gave it the task of mapping the new mountain species but rather of someone try distribution of species and
 ascertaining the bouning to control the problem of farm pests in spite daries of the natural life zones its initial
 of the fact that the nearest farming areas were work started in arizona and by 1892 enough data more than
 a hundred miles away and his own had been gathered in the south and central plains country was even farther
 loring s work was to prepare a map of the life zones of the united seen as a significant one
 in attempting to states and adjacent regions of canada delineate the wildlife zones of north america in simple terms it
 divided the continent into in the late 1880 s naturalists began a serious two main zones the boreal in the
 north and re examination of theories relating to the geo austral in the south however between the two graphic distribution
 of species across the conti scientists placed a minor division calling it the nent until that time the generally accepted
 transition zone it was a broad belt which passed premise was that the united states was divided south of the
 great lakes and extended on both into three distinct zones eastern central and sides of the international boundary before swing
 western however studies showed that certain ing south at the rocky mountains species found in the east also were common
 in newly explored regions of the west giving rise the author is associate director of the glenbow i museum calgary
 and editor of alberta history i to the belief that flora and fauna were distributed i above is a view
 near maligne river area in 1932 in east west transcontinental belts the distinc i as a result of these developments
 it became voles shrews pocket gophers ground squirrels increasingly important for the bureau to clearly mice weasels woodchucks and coyotes
 he define the limits of the various zones and its of provided solid evidence that the ranges of many ficers
 realized that too little work had been done rodents went well into canada in the so called transition zone in
 1893 a year while loring was in the edmonton district he after the report was published biologists concen became interested
 in the possibilities of extending trated on wyoming the dakotas and other his studies to the headwaters of the athabasca
 regions of the great plains and a year later river in the isolated region near the old hudfocused on montana
 however it soon became son s bay company post of jasper house evident that the great plains extended well into
 the area was important for several reasons canada before they met the boreal forests first it was the most southerly
 point on the arc it was because of these circumstances that tic watershed yet was not far from the northern
 loring was launched into a two year association limits of the great plains by studying the fauna with the jasper
 region born in cleveland ohio of the region particularly small rodents he on march 6 1871 the biologist was the
 son of could determine whether the ranges of many agria naval lieutenant who had retired to owego cultural pests went
 beyond established farming n y while loring was still a child the boy regions therefore when he returned to washsoon
 learned to love the wilderness areas and ington that autumn he was able to convince his while a student at
 owego free academy he superiors to send him on an expedition to jasper often was in trouble for neglecting his
 school house in the following year work in favour of studying birds and animals loring was back in edmonton at
 the beginning as a teenager he began to do volunteer work of august 1895 and immediately set to work for
 the united states government submitting to hire a guide and crew his timing was forreports of fauna in his region
 and recording tuitous as jasper was becoming a focal point for migrations local prospectors prior to that time it had
 been when the bureau of biological survey was frequented only by the occasional party of formed in 1889 loring applied
 for a position but hunters traders or iroquois freemen two years was turned down because he was only eighteen earlier
 a promising deposit of mica had been year s old however he persisted and two years found west of jasper
 and two or three parties had later he was appointed to their staff he was im gone out to search
 for gold there was a feeling mediately put to work with the more experienced that a lucky prospector might find
 the mother lode biologists from which the fine gold had washed down the in the summer of 1894 after having
 proven athabasca and for years had been panned from himself to be a hard working and zealous man the river
 farther downstream in the field loring was sent to carry out field as guides loring hired daniel e noyes and
 work in the dakotas by this time he already had his son daniel junior they operated a trading shown a
 particular interest in small rodents post at whitemud creek not far from the prewhich were becoming his specialty for this
 sent village of marlboro and knew the jasper reason he was selected late in the season to go region intimately
 by the time the party was to western canada to check on the distribution ready to leave it consisted of
 loring the two of certain species particularly mice shrews and noyes cook texas willie shanno george voles gagnon and two
 american prospectors walter after travelling through manitoba and sas bisson and samuel a din who decided to travel katchewan loring
 decided to work farther west with the expedition there were enough supplies he initially went to canmore within the shadow
 for the biologist to remain in the field for two of the rockies and worked for a month in the
 or three months his objective he told the press area but then he moved to the edmonton region was to
 make a biological survey of the country which he saw as being on the line between the and collect a
 series of animals that could not be transition zone and the boreal zone in fact he found elsewhere 2 chose
 the north saskatchewan river as his when members of the expedition left edmondividing line concentrating his activities in the ton
 on august 10 they travelled due west into grain fields and valleys south of strathcona for the muskegs which loring
 described as a thick a month he scoured the area obtaining an im spongy moss beneath which is a bottomless
 mass pressive collection of study skins including of decayed vegetation which in rainy season 2 this map of the life
 zones of the united states shows the transition zone extending into the western canadian prairies the map appeared in the
 yearbook of the united states department of agriculture in 1894 becomes muck that is dangerous to travel over rockies than
 he was in the numerous anthills horses frequently get mired either drown or which he found along the way for
 the first time have to be left to a slow death 3 he believed he also observed golden eagles goshawks
 that the muskegs had been created by beavers ravens chipmunks and red squirrels damming the streams the jasper house is
 situated in a clearing sur along the way the biologist recorded the rounded by a thick growth of second growth
 presence of coyotes lynx rabbits jays ruffed pines he stated around the cabin artemesia grouse loons grebes and various species
 of frigida grows in abundance the trail from the ducks in the tall grass beside a slough west of jasper
 to the henry house leads along the lac ste anne he observed a number of shrews athabasca river for about
 40 miles through tr acts loux richardsoni 4 and trapped some using of second growth groves of poplars oatmeal as
 bait the first creatures which loring studied in the about 20 miles east of the crossing of the jasper mountains
 were packrats neotoma drum mccleod sicj river one first meets with coni mondi which he found were plentiful throughout ferous
 trees he recorded a large species of the region poplar was once abundant forming immense i found them living in
 the crevices of rocks where forests but recent fires have left only the charred they had their nests i did
 not notice any of their houses trunks standing or fallen in some places to such after passing the first range
 of mountains at the jasper house a ledge of rocks were found where they had an extent as to form
 an almost impassable net been living for many years the outside of the rock work at a point 20 miles
 west of what is was badly stained the odor peculiar to them could known as the ‘ big muskeg is
 a spot that has be smelled fully 100 feet away i found three separate escaped the forest fires the timber
 here is very nests in this ledge in three days caught 13 specimens the houses were all in the crevices
 of the large some of the trees poplars pines attain rock were composed of sticks leaves small pieces ing the
 height of over 100 èet 0:eet 3 feet through of dirt bones stones the first afternoon i visited the base the
 place one of the rats poked its head out of a hole after crossing the athabasca river the party watched
 watched me setting a trap it soon after received a load of shot the indians call them travelled upstream into
 the mountains here the medicine rats on account of the musk gland on the biologist was less interested in the
 towering stomach 3 while studying the packrats loring also their various habits when hunting for sheep observed two golden mantled
 ground squirrels above the lick he came across a large black bear spermophilus lateralis and collected them both which he
 killed and prepared while we were these were the only ones he saw during this ex there i informed him
 of the large grouse found pedition so he assumed that the others must have in the recesses of the mountains
 it being as large gone into hibernation or larger than a domestic hen also of the moun when the biologist
 reached henry house he tam siffler sic or whistler found about the timber hurried past it to visit a slide
 area about fifteen line of which he intends obtaining specimiles on the other side of the present town of mens
 jasper there the senior noyes told him he would the black bear mentioned by purches was only have his first
 chance to see the shy pika or rock one of several which the loring party bagged rabbit lagonysprincips as the
 indians had said in one instance the killing involved considerable that none lived east of that point here at the
 risk as described by the naturalist slidel i found lagonys common he said a young fellow myself were riding silently
 through secured several when a severe snow storm drove the timber a short distance from the trail when we saw
 them in the next day i visited the place killed three bears in a tall dead tree two cubs of
 about 75 pounds the mother one of the cubs it fell to the two although it was a warm day
 they were gun of my friend was jet black while the other was reluctant to leave their hiding places he
 waited a cinnamon color as its mother my friend shot at the around for three days to observe the creatures
 but old bear she fell behind a ridge out of our sight when none appeared or were heard he had
 to we waited to see if she was going to charge but after the lapse of a few seconds we
 walked up were give up he didn t see them again until just astonished not to find or see her
 before he left the mountains when on a warm then we turned our guns on the cubs wounded sunny day
 he collected two more both of them whereupon they set up an awful blating during the next several weeks lonng
 ranged much like a calf one of them came down the tree throughout the territory going as far west as
 the hind end first blating loudly all the time but the mother did not show up until after we had
 killed both yellowhead pass and off into the mountains of them brought the horses up then we caught fringing the
 valley on one trip he travelled some si ght of her looking at us from a clump of bushes about
 twenty miles back from the river and although 200 yards away it was a little too far away for my
 he marvelled at the unburned timber and huge gun so i began to blat like one of the cubs which
 had the effect of bringing her up to within a hundred yards glaciers he had considerable trouble travelling of us
 in short order here she stopped i pulled the because of the thick spongy moss and muskegs trigger but the
 shell failed to explode she started to at a place about forty miles west of henry house walk around us
 but soon stopped looked at us i he discovered a beautiful park surrounded by put a bullet through her back
 then finished her with heavy green timber it was about a thousand feet a load of buck shot although her
 hair stood high she made no attempt to fight us below the timber line and through it drained a number
 of small streams upon closer examina loring had a similar experience with grizzly tion he found that the area about
 five miles bears which he expected to put up a fight when long and a quarter mile wide was covered
 with wounded but instead they simply tried to run a thick moss which contained a veritable network away his examination
 of the bears stomachs of mice runways as our horses approached indicated that they were living almost wholly he commented
 we saw the little animals dart upon berries in other places he commented out of one hole into another because
 of the four we found where they had been rooting for different species of mice he observed there he roots
 in one place in particular i remember we named the place rodent valley found a piece of ground several acres
 square that was literally covered with small patches 5 10 during the summer a few miners wandered 15 feet square
 where they had been workinto the loring camp from the west they had been as far as canoe river west
 of the divide ing it resembled the work of hogs had the apwhere they had found some promising mica pearance
 of being done that day deposits one of the party george purches perhaps triggered by purches visit to his noted
 that on our return we met at the roche camp loring set out to find a marmot antomys miette mr
 loring the energetic field naturalist caligatus known locally as the siffleur in late of the biological department washington with september
 when he learned that a member of dan noyes as guide he was collecting speci his party had shot one
 about forty miles west of mens of birds and animals also taking notes of henry house he hurried over to
 try to observe 4 boils for more than a mile near by are several hot sulphur springs which will undoubtedly
 be of much value when the country is opened up 6 the biologist was excited about his successful trip he
 collected more than three hundred specimens besides personally killing two black and two cinnamon bears the rest of the party
 1 had taken two cinnamon and two grizzly bears ‘ ‘ four bighorn sheep two caribou a moose and j
 a lynx besides plenty of smaller game and they f had done this without injury to themselves or the loss
 of any horses loring report which he prepared in washington was brief but it did list the various mammals and
 birds he had collected or observed it included thirty species of animals and forty four of birds and sufficiently impressed
 officials of the biological survey that permission was given for a return trip in 1896 this time loring decided that
 he wanted to explore the upper reaches of the smoky river no doubt having been told about the area by
 the k r noyes family he had no trouble re engaging the before loring set out on his first trip
 to jasper in 1895 father and son team as his guides and on may he posed for edmonton photographer c
 w mathers at 25 1896 they set out again for jasper before right is loring s guide daniel noyes he
 left edmonton the biologist noted that he particularly wanted to obtain specimens of flying the creatures however a severe snow
 storm occurred and although the hunters had seen and squirrels marmots and a small meadow mouse which are only to
 be found in the northern parts heard the animals loring had no such luck of this country he believed he
 had gone out then to add to his frustration some indians too late in the previous year and that many
 trapped a live marmot but they would not give animals had already gone into hibernation this it to him instead
 they turned it over to noyes to present to charles de cazes their indian agent year he intended to spend
 the entire spnng sumin edmonton however loring did have the mer and autumn in the field chance to view the
 creature in captivity it following the same route back to the valley was he noted very ugly when teased loring
 immediately set up camp on maligne would growl like a dog it was very fond of cab river not far
 from its confluence with the bage would sit upon its hind feet hold the whirlpool in the previous year he
 felt that the leaf in its fore legs while it ate region had shown considerable promise concen by late october
 loring was advised by his trating again on small rodents he set out more guides to leave the valley while
 the rivers were than 150 traps in a week baiting them with still open and before the onset of winter
 storms oatmeal and meat for the mice voles and during the two and a half months in the district shrews
 the biologist estimated he had travelled eight hun during the three weeks he worked in the area dred miles not
 including the numerous short loring was often amused by the antics of a hunting trips from the base camp he
 was very friendly porcupine it was very inquisitive impressed with the region and commented that came up to within thirty
 feet of me he said the scenery in the jasper pass is simply grand sat on a large rock watching
 me closely on either side the mountains rise for thousands several times it went away but always came of feet
 at the head of the madigne river we found back to the same position its actions were not a canyon
 fully 300 feet deep and not more than unlike those of a monkey but of course much 15 feet wide
 through which the water rushes and slower it sat on its hind legs used its fore feet 5 as hands
 scratching its sides frequently in a and saw a large ewe just returning to the crags ludicrous manner he then
 noticed another ten coming down the loring had considerable success at maligne trail but they disappeared into a grove of
 timber river from which point he conducted his search he had almost given up seeing them again when for a
 number of mammals including marmots he happened to look down and saw them about and pikas the former were common
 above the fifty feet below him they were standing he said tree line and even where there was heavy snow
 in a half circle their necks stretched forwaal nostrils he could see where they had burrowed through extended as they
 sniffed the air smelling no doubt the blood spill from five goats killed a few days the drifts to sun
 themselves whenever he tried previous for several minutes they stood occasionally to spy on them he heard them ‘‘ uttering
 their starting suddenly as though alarmed then advancing sharp shrill note of alarm which was answered slowly to the spot
 where we had loaded the goats on by others within hearing as they caught sight of our horses at length
 they gained confidence began me from some lofty perch above as for pikas licking but it was quite evident that
 they suspected something for while licking they frequently started he saw plenty of them above the tree line they thr
 ew their heads back staring wildly about did not seem inclined to move about much until the sun had warmed
 the chilly morning air he another time he had just killed two sheep in wrote when they ventur ed out
 to the grassy a canyon when he saw nine more coming down plots bordering their places of habitat scudding a
 trail on the opposite side several hundred yards back to the slide rock with their mouths full of away travelling
 in single file they walked to choice grasses weeds tender tops of small the two dead comrades and stood in
 a bunch a bushes he learned that once their cache of hay few yards away staring and seemingly unafraid was
 found it was an easy matter to lie in wait after watching them a few minutes i opened fire for
 them and to shoot the specimens he required soon had seven dead during which time the remaining ones stood gazing
 at me watching their comrades the maligne river camp proved to be an ex rolling into the creek at last
 my ammunition gave cellent location for hunting bighorn sheep and out when i left the two remaining sheep stood mountain
 goats loring s descriptions at times gazing at me from the top of the canyon on the opposeem to be
 more those of an avid hunter than a site side where they had slowly walked it may be well to
 say that the sheep on this mountain had not naturalist but they do provide one of the earliest been disturbed
 since the fall previous this may acdetailed accounts of big game hunting in that count for their being so tame
 but fr om what i am area his description of hunting bighorns is as able to learn they are naturally
 stupid animals easily follows killed when attacked by a dog they make for the nearest tucks mounting one of the
 larger boulders mountain sheep are common in suitable locations hold their pursuers at bay with their horns within the bounds
 of the first four ranges of moun during rainy weather they seldom come to the licks tains or in other
 words as far west as the henry but on a bright day after a shower the hunter can nearly house
 west of this point the indians claim none are lobe found as far as my experiences went i found always
 be sure of finding them these licks ale usually this to be true they seemed to inhabit craggy moun the
 cut banks of mountain streams sometimes at tains with gr assy slopes descended to the salt licks timber line but
 mor e usually in the valleys one is daily during the heat of the summer we found them usually aware
 of their presence long before they come coming down irregularly as late as october 23 rd at to it by
 the numerous sheep goat trails leading from this time of the year they do not remain very long the mountain
 in coming down to the licks sheep but return to the high mountains as soon as they have seldom stop
 to feed but leave that till they have finished licking during the heat of the summer returned however their habits
 at the licks are much different i did not notice any sentinels posted about on tucks i have been told
 by the indians that they do not come while the animals were feeding as stated by many down during the
 heat of the day but r emain in the writers kids of various sizes were seen on june 20 shade
 of tucks in the high mountains again on july 6 9 the pelage of the old ones this may be
 true in some cases but i do not think at this time was worn to such an extent as to
 make the specimens worthless it is usually the case as i have known them to come to licks at all
 hours of the day have found them as a hunter loring also had success with laying in the shade of
 cut banks while others walked mountain goats although he was not impressed about licked the salt dirt leisurely while on
 the with them their gait is awkward ungainly way to these places should it be a lick near a trail
 where they are accustomed to being harr assed they he commented rather slower than one would descend with caution trotting
 along leisur ely then expect after reading those accounts of their agility pausing a few minutes to survey the country
 before in springing from rock to rock i am sorry to say them while the lambs frolic about that i
 did not notice any of these fancy move one morning loring visited one of these licks ments he felt quite
 confident that on level 6 ground he could outrun one of those animals the site causing him to suspect her
 nest was near i could have killed two or more but their skins were by i searched a long time
 he said was worthless we had plenty of meat in camp so i finally rewarded by seeing a little downy
 one runamused myself chasing them succeeded in getting ning through the tall grass i succeeded in catchup within 20 feet
 of one would not let him go up ing it when it peeped the old bird wildly flew the mountain
 whereupon he lowered his head as though preparing to charge he looked so ugly that about me the bird probably
 nested in the tall i cocked my gun in self defence but he quickly started rank grass the next day
 he came back and off in an opposite direction succeeded in getting killed a male sandpiper at the same place
 but sucahead of me whereupon i gave up the chase ceeded only in wounding the female the biologist killed two
 lynx during his travels during the latter part of july loring two and observed that the indians snar ed them

 current he and a small plant known to them as ‘ love plant his horse were carried downstream for about
 five grated nutmeg dried codfish several other arti hundred yards all the time with the biologist s des which i
 have forgotten thesewere foot caught in the stirrup i threw my gun chopped fine and placed on a stick near
 their trap ashore said loring drew my hunting knife loring s only notable adventure with birds cut the stirrup strap
 rolled off the horse s back during the season occurred when he took a frogged for shore my hunting coat

 axe was layed up 18 ing plaintively it tried to draw him away from days had hives for a week
 swelled up like a poisoned pup the indians put me in a sweat house like to kill me almost an
 entire j month passed before loring was well enough to undertake the arduous journey he had planned to the headwaters
 of the smoky river finally setting out along the stony river now snake indian river on august 20 loring experienced
 the same problems with muskegs and burnt timber as he had in the previous year when he tried to leave
 the valley high winds have felled the trees in the trail so thick he com a mented that we were
 often obliged to seek some other place of tr avel striking the trail again several miles ahead crossing over the
 height of land between the athabasca and smoky rivers j they reached the upper waters of a stream which he
 called grand cache river here the travelling was no easier among the dense willows which they encountered on several occasions
 when we got off the trail went through such places he said the horses lost their way the only thing
 that indicated their whereabouts was the waving bushes cracking of sticks they passed through sulphur prairie and after two or
 three days travelling they came to fishing lake now grande cache lake the trail leads george purches right visited loring
 during his jasper through valleys windfalls thickets of poplars contnbutor to t an ca ispor s jackpine innumerable muskegs said
 loring guide daniel noyes late in 1895 until muskeg creek is reached when it dies out 7 entirely one is
 obliged to travel by guess ‘ 1 apparently the muskegs are so bad that people travel where they find it
 the best we were obliged to take to the mountain sides while travelling through that region the only people loring
 saw were a few hunting parties ‘ mostly local iroquois on the smoky river he met a native woman with
 seven children who was trying to subsist by trapping and snaring she had no gun and the biologist was concerned
 that she would not survive the winter loring followed the general route of the smoky river downstream until the party
 was well out of the mountains and then headed south along the foothills the area consisted of rolling broken country
 filled with muskegs innumerable prairies lakes water courses they passed two deserted trading posts of pierre grey and on october
 8 they reached the edmonton jasper trail not far from the site of jasper house in all the journey had
 taken more than seven weeks the trip was worth the effort as loring had taken extensive notes of his observations
 he learned for example that a massive epidemic had wiped out most of the rabbit population in j alden loring
 in later life places where last year a person could have killed 15 or 20 in an hour or so
 he said one may then cold weather which caused a heavy crust to travel half a day without seeing one
 in but two form this allowed the indians to overtake spots did we find them in any numbers one of
 kill band after band of these animals with clubs these being at pierre grey s place about 40 miles they
 made good the opportunity in those two north east of jasper house the other in the winters almost exterminated them
 from that part foothills of the mountains on the jasper trail of the country he commented that a few rabbits
 were noticed other animals which loring either saw or in the high mountains but most preferred the observed their tracks
 included wolverines valleys they were very tame he added wolves coyotes bears lynx and all sorts of seldom moved from
 their resting places under smaller squirrels shrews and mice he was parroots stumps or logs as the horses passed ticularly
 interested in the tiny rodents as he loring also recorded the existence of two types believed there was a good
 opportunity for him of caribou the indians claim that there are two to discover some new sub species he also
 saw species in this vicinity he said one living in plenty of birds ducks geese grouse ptarthe high mountains known
 as the mountain migan jays owls and others caribou the other found in the muskegs in the loring experienced a
 snowstorm during the valleys called muskeg caribou the muskeg trek and by late october many animals had gone caribou they
 say is a trifle smaller than his moun into hibernation at last when the expedition aptam relative the flesh is
 said to contain small peared to be in danger of becoming snowed in worms one old fellow told me if
 he saw the two the biologist reluctantly turned back towards edanimals dead together he would not be able to monton
 it had been quite a season much of it distinguish them unless he knew they had come successful but as
 he told a friend the rest of from different parts the time i had a hell of a time besides
 his moose and elk were said to be fairly plentiful illnesses the wife of a native trapper took a fancy
 although unusual winter conditions for two suc to him and the husband threatened to gun me cessive winters had reduced
 the latter s numbers if i didn t stop talking to his squaw but as heavy snows had been followed
 by a thaw and he complained he didn t see a white woman 8 for five months twelve days had
 horrible a year after his jasper trip loring resigned dreams in addition he lived on tea without from the biological
 survey to study overseas for sugar milk bannock dried meat straight for a year at the london zoological gardens while
 two months and went hunting with some in in europe he was commissioned by the u s nadmans they nearly
 ran my legs off 3 tional museum to collect animal and bird the return trip to edmonton which took specimens
 showing the same zeal that he had almost two weeks was not much better although exhibited in the jasper region
 he broke all it gave loring a final opportunity to observe and previous records of the museum by collecting and
 collect more animals and birds along the way preserving the skins of 913 specimens in sixty what impressed him the
 most at this season were three days this required extensive travels the huge numbers of ducks and geese we through
 much of western europe passed numerous lakes nov 4 th 5 th 6 th heanng of his exploits the british
 museum he said they were filled with ducks so large tried to engage him to collect in south america were
 the flocks that as they arose from the water but instead he accepted the position of curator half a mile
 away the sound resembled distant of animals at the new york zoological park thunder he believed that most of the
 birds were during the years he was there he undertook fur american wigeons anas americana and canada ther field work
 including two trips to alaska geese one was in an unsuccessful attempt to capture by this time there was three
 inches of ice on kodiak bear cubs while the second resulted in the streams and the last two days of
 his journey his taking four dall sheep but they did not surwere made in a blinding snow storm yet he
 vive the trip back to the zoo reported that he had spent a successful in as his reputation grew loring
 carried out teresting and in some cases exciting summer studies and conducted classes at a number of intravelling in all
 about 1 400 miles he secured stitutions then in 1909 he was selected as one an excellent collection of specimens
 of birds and of the naturalists to accompany president mammals he saw four humming birds but did theodore roosevelt on
 an expedition to africa not secure any but killed two great grey owls while there loring continued to pursue his
 an evening gros beak and a solitary sand favorite subject of rodents and became known to piper 4 the natives
 as bwana panya or the mouse upon his arrival in washington loring sub master however when he killed a lion
 after a mitted his findings and then went on to other breathless charge they changed his name to lion assignments
 never again returning to study in master roosevelt commented of loring and his the jasper region he was disappointed that
 he two fellow naturalists that not only would it had failed to get some of the specimens he have been
 indeed difficult to find three better men sought but at least two of them were sent at a for heir
 particular work but it would have been later date his guide dan noyes had become equally difficult to find three
 better men for any interested in the young naturalist s work so at emergency i could not speak too highly
 of the first opportunity he killed a male and female them 7 mountain flying squirrel and shipped them off to
 on his return from africa in 1910 loring went washington on a number of speaking tours joining a loring wrote
 a few reports and at least two chautauqua circuit and lecturing about his articles on his canadian experiences were african

 of going west to home behind them at the horizon they met no one on stead in alberta they were
 only twenty and this section of the trail in spite of the fact that twenty two years of age but
 felt confident of it was well marked and appeared to be much locating a toronto friend who had preceded them
 travelled two years earlier and who would be able to pro on the third day they arrived at bassano a

 of the blackfoot week service at fieldholme on the red deer indians during the four day journey they met river
 it took the trio a whole day to cover these another homesteading hopeful by the name of thirty miles and
 once again they were surprised george spaiding who decided to join them he at seeing only one sign of habitation

 group became five river valley was perhaps a mile wide at the prairie level and fully 300 feet down to
 the water the plans were soon finalized my uncles and their hillsides were heavily grown with cottonwoods and train acquaintance
 were to trek from calgary to poplars and the bottom land with willows strange the goose lake line which would
 eventually to say none of the tr ees reached up above the prairie become the cnr main line from saskatoon
 to line and it wasn t until within a few yards of the edge of the valley that one was
 aware of such a large gash calgar y at that time it was completed to through the country kindersley sask
 about sixty miles east of the although they had enjoyed the warmth of late alberta border their destination was a
 large tract of open land about fifty miles or more to the west spnng on the prairie it was quite
 cool in the of that border it was said by the dominion land valley with winter s ice still in
 the river the rather frightening descent of the long and winding office to be suitable for farming the other two

 then they discovered that the large barge type or two ferry that carried passengers across the river the trio set
 out from calgar y with a team of operated only in the summer months they would horses a wagon and
 a saddle horse bound for have to cross on the ice bassano on the main line of the cp r

 appeared in the york pioneer 11 his story resumes where they had been hoping to find suitable the river proper
 was about 200 feet across and we homestead land there they spent two days lookmade the crossing safely until within
 about 300 feet ing for surveyor s stakes which would indicate of the shore here the ice had melted and
 the water their location but the grass was so long that their was a bit too deep for our team
 and wagon a rancher living nearby john smith came along about then and efforts were in vain my uncle descnbed
 how the advised us to leave the wagon on the ice overnig ht surveying was done and to bring the
 horses ashore a little farther upstream we did so and spent the night at his ranch in the i might
 explain that the three western provinces were morning the river had frozen along the shore and we first surveyed into
 townships six miles to a side were able to get the wagon onto solid ground with these were numbered from
 the united states boundonly a slight wetting we learned later that the river ary and also west from the vanous
 mendians later ice went out about two days after our crossing so if the townships were surveyed into 36 parcels
 of one we had been that much later we would have had to square mile each or 640 acres and
 when this was wait about two weeks for clear water and the ferty done an iron stake was put in
 the ground on the exact northeast corner of each parcel and so marked with after crossing the river they set
 out to the roman numeals that it told the number of townships north east headed for berry creek in that
 from the united states border and also the number twenty four mile stretch they saw no house nor from the
 vanous meridians the boundary between fence only a haystack at berry creek they alberta and saskatchewan was the fourth meridian

 area stones had been added to form front and hind legs they had no trouble finding surveyor s stakes and
 a tail so that it resembled a serpent mr which were also called mound pins but they dowker told them
 that it was called ribstone hill never did find their temporary camp nor any of and was there when he
 arrived in alberta so he the landmarks they had felt sure of seeing again assumed that it had been built
 by indians as the five members of the party had adjoining there were ver y few stones of any size

 first persons to put up a tent in their township dragged a considerable distance the only other habitation in sight
 was a tent on after another day s travel they reached the area a homestead in the next township owned

 on his homestead about 1915 norweigan who had arrived the day before they feet above ground to keep out surface
 water had stones and earth were shovelled back around the their next task was to build a small corral f
 or cribbing the water supply was good and the horses using willow stakes and barbed wire although slightly alkaline it
 served for three or they had been advised to plow a fireguard four years until wells could be drilled on
 each around as much ground as possible in order to of the homesteads these new wells were only save grass
 for feed for the horses in case a fire eight feet deep but the supply was more than adecame through
 it was fortunate they did quate and the quality excellent because it was only a matter of days before they
 their first house was a fourteen by sixteenexperienced their first prairie fire it came from foot shack with sloping roof
 built on high ground the south and seemed to stretch for miles east and near the well a small cellar
 was dug for keeping west its heat created a draft which added to the food cool and was later used
 for coal for the high wind so that the flames were driven many horses they built a sod wall stable
 fourteen by yards ahead of the actual line of the fire from twenty eight feet the sods were thick having
 their first sighting of the fire until it went through been specially plowed for the purpose cross with a roar
 was a matter of only a few minutes pieces of lumber were put on the walls and the nothing in
 their fireguard area was damaged but whole thing covered with prairie hay it made in every direction right to the
 skyline the prairie a satisfactory shelter while the weather was good was black they had saved about forty acres of
 but after heavy rain it was as wet inside as out pasture grass during that first summer they broke about
 their sources of water were several until the thirty acres to have the ground ready for sowing early part of
 the summer water could be found the following year in the fall another fire came in the small potholes or
 sloughs which dotted the through almost without warning leaving very prairie as the weather got warmer these dried little grass
 long enough to make hay but they up and water had to be hauled in barrels from cut about fifteen
 loads and considered themselves a well dug by a russian family three miles to lucky by the second summer there
 were neightheir west however it soon became apparent ours on all sides and some community life was that they would
 have to sink a well for them developing the following years were spent selves they took turns digging and hauling
 up breaking ground fencing and making improvethe earth and eventually struck water at about ments and additions to equipment thirty
 five feet the hole measured about four for the first three years all supplies of lumber feet to each side
 and cribbing was extended two fence posts wire food etc had to be hauled 13 from bassano in 1912 the
 cpr extended its red they first saw the youngstown site when there deer swift current line to castor and corona
 was only one tent during the next three or four tion so that trips for supplies were shortened to years
 they watched it grow into a large comabout forty miles then in 1913 the cnr com munity with many fine
 homes stores banks pleted its line from alsask to drumheller and hotels a mounted police detachment grain established a townsite
 that became known as elevators and lumber yards a far cry from their youngstown it was only six miles away
 and early days in a lonely land and fifty three years although they wished it had been closer they later
 when my uncle wrote his story the four realized that many people were anywhere from hudson s bay blankets were
 still prized twenty to sixty miles from a railway possessions down the bow a trip down the swift flowing bow
 at this season of the year when the melting snows of the mountains have transformed it from a peaceful prairie
 stream into a rushing river has enough of the spice of danger to make it interesting to lovers of adventure
 combined with this the shores present an ever varying panorama in which quiet prairie scenes rugged rocky shores pine clad
 hills intermingle to make the scenery a delight to the eye parties who have taken the trip say that it
 rivals in interest and beauty a trip down the famous st lawrence on sunday morning last three adventurous calgarians messrs
 c f corner a p godin and w r wright started from the langevin bridge in a 10 foot peterborough
 canoe carrying 250 lbs for a trip down to the blackfoot reserve near gleichen everything went along smoothly until the
 mouth of fish creek was reached 18 miles from calgaiy where on account of rapids it was necessary to make
 a portage of half a mile other small rapids were run in safety but after passing the mouth of highwood
 river the river widens and becomes deeper and slower from there on the scenery becomes more beautiful and varied at
 pine canyon 10 miles south east of high river the banks rise to a height of 150 feet on one
 side covered with spruce and the other being a perpendicular cliff of solid sandstone rock the party camped for the
 night about 15 miles south east of the reserve line at 10 a m monday they reached the blackfoot mission
 and saw the rations agent mr lauder distribute the weekly rations to the indians the mission is prettily situated and
 the hospital school cottages etc are neatly kept with another hour s paddling they reached the agency four miles by
 trail but 10 miles by the river they having travelled over 100 miles in less than 10 hours here a
 picnic in charge of agent magnus begg and mr j desbarres of gleichen was going on and all kinds of
 sports were being indulged in among the visitors to the picnic were mr a e forget assistant indian commissioner regina
 rev john mcdougall of morley and mr ponton of the dominion survey department mr lunn of gleichen was present with
 his bagpipes and helped greatly to enliven the proceedings with stirring scottish airs about 100 whites and 500 indians were
 present and enjoyed themselves thoroughly about 7 o clock the canoe was loaded into a wagon and the trip of
 seven miles to gleichen made by trail where the nwmp detachment hospitally entertained the visitors until no 1 brought them
 to calgary they speak very highly of the pleasure and excitement of the trip which they enjoyed most thoroughly alberta

 at 11 30 half hour before closing time in may 1946 commissioner mccrimmon after lunch we learned from an indian
 scout made a second visit to rocky mountain house that the o chiese group was camped by the side with
 the assurance of stelfox now acting sub of the highway to jasper near a place called agent that the chippewas
 would meet him and marlboro so off we went to find them it was might agree to a treaty a

 smelling pines and spruce the agencies j e pugh agency superintendent commissioner carried his bag which was filled and w

 may 10 and were met by impressive briefcases when we met the indians stelfox he had some good news more
 crees must have sensed the presence of money for their would sign and members of the sunchild band eyes never
 left that bag all but o chiese he were there for treaty payment the other news ignored it in fact
 he wasn t enthusiastic over was not good the chippewas had not appeared any of the visiting party they were
 working on a timber limit some eigh john o chiese was a strange little effeminate teen miles west of edson
 and would not come man the last person one would pick as the to rocky mountain house for the meeting
 after leader in his wake followed a burly halfbreed some discussion it was agreed that after paying named dejarlais he
 was the chief s interpreter 17 but it was evident that he came as a confident protection of forest reserves
 wild life and and adviser of 0 chiese the government inter registered traplines his headache was the preter for the
 treaty party was joe dechaine a trespassing and poaching of the gypsy indians cree from hobbema joe had been around
 the they recognized no man made regulations furworld as a soldier and knew men he was a good thermore they
 had no status either as treaty inmatch for dejarlais who did the interpreting dians or as white residents officially they
 did while joe checked it mccrinimon and o chiese not exist did all the talking no one else in the
 group were they subject to man made regulations uttered a word they were of course but huestis and his o
 chiese had magnetism when he spoke and ministers chose not to prosecute nevertheless his sincerity was obvious he said that
 his the existing conditions could not continue inreligion was based on what the maker of the definitely and mr huestis
 was at rocky to help heavens and the earth gave to the birds and the treaty commissioner beasts if he
 had givento them then he must the meeting was held in an old hall which was have given to humans
 as well if a bird may rest drab and dull as well as stuffy and hot but the in a
 tree above surely then man may rest in peace reception was cool and again we had to call it under
 that tree the world was made for man to a failure o chiese must have had them under use and
 no one had a right to say otherwise a spell a fear of punishment by their god if they o
 chiese even referred to the bible or his in changed their way of life terpreter did for dejarlais talked much
 longer than o chiese the crees waited patiently for their treaty mccrimmon in turn made attractive offers of money it
 was to be paid after the meeting this assistance but even a display of the currency did not take long
 and was followed by a meeting made no impression on o chiese and either at which their chief yellow knees
 a nd his counfrom fear or superstition no one else indicated cillors tried to outdo each other in long by
 word or sign that he did not agree with their harangues on the shortcomings of indian affairs leader he refused
 all overtures but if impres officials finally a chippewa named joe sions meant anything we felt that the journey strawberry
 entered the discussions he lived was not a complete waste of time some of the unofficially on the north end
 of the sunchild young men looked wistfully at the money and reserve where he had made his home and had
 were no doubt thinking how nice it would be trapped for years apparently he did not propose to have the
 security which their cree friends now to leave possessed but night was coming on and we had joe was a
 stocky chap with a ver y red nose to depart we had failed again but left in the and blossoms
 on his cheeks perhaps that is how belief that after a year of thought about the many he got the
 name strawberry he spoke some advantages his followers might persuade english and was both verbose nd rgumentative o chiese to
 sign any arguments he put forward on behalf of the stelfox persisted in his efforts and was so con sunchild
 group helped joe more than the crees fident of success that the commissioner returned nevertheless they supported him and asked
 if he in may 1947 this time a number of the chip could be taken into membership until his people
 pewas did turn up at rocky mountain house but took treaty if joe had superstitions they were o chiese did
 not come nor did he send any ex overridden by the economic benefits commisplanation instead big john a leader of
 a sub sioner mccrimmon was pleased to enter his group became the recognized spokesman name on band list on these
 conditions the con stelfox had invited the local mla the hon version of one chippewa was better than none a
 j hooke and the provincial game commis by this time a permanent sub agency had been sioner eric huestis to
 the meeting mr hooke established at rocky mountain house to look paid his respects left photographers from his after the
 affairs of the sunchild reserve a publicity branch and then retired mr huestis fulltime agent replaced mr stelfox but the
 latremained with the treaty party for he was vitally ter remained a friend of the chippewas and interested in the
 results the province was now never relaxed in his endeavour to persuade them responsible for all natural resources except na
 to take treaty finally in 1950 a minor group tional parks and indian reserves and mr huestis of fifteen families
 lead by andrew strawberry was having many problems these included the agreed to meet the commissioner mr mccrim 18 mon
 came west in may and the treaty party con the enumeration of families and signing was sisting of the commissioner
 myself harold tedious work but interesting these people were moore clerk from the regional office and joe pagans some spoke
 a little english but none had dechaine the interpreter arrived in rocky for been to school they could neither read
 nor write another try they had continued the old indian custom of the meeting was held on may 13 when
 a few giving each person a name christian or first chippewas did sign but strawberry refused he names were not
 common when asked the names didn t give a reason we adjourned at supper of their children there was blankness
 until intime and were a discouraged lot for it appeared terpreter dechaine suggested something to them to be a hopeless
 task then near midnight we then with a smile they might call the child after learned from a sawmill operator
 that strawberry a pretty wild flower dechaine was experienced had told him the reason for the refusal it seemed in
 the ways of indians nothing stumped him he that the reserve left out a block of land along the was
 a valuable man at this time finally all were baptiste river where the chippewas had lived signed and buried some
 of their people strawberry would sign only if this were included maps were during the meetings artist nicholas de grandhurriedly
 consulted and it was decided to seek maison came up from banff with a movie and authority to exchange this
 land for an equal still camera and his usual painter s easel however the movie camera wouldn t work the
 acreage on the opposite boundary of the reserve light was bad for the stills and the indians were immediate action
 was necessary as the indians too excited to sit for paintings he got only one said they were leaving town
 so next morning mr portrait that of a cree couple and a still mccrimmon arose at 6 am to phone
 ottawa photo of the treaty meeting so this adhesion to he had to use a pay phone and in depositing
 all treaty six went into history on may 14 1950 the quarters and dimes he apparently gave the john o
 chiese died in 1951 and big john took director of indian affairs major mckay the im over as chief of
 the band as i now write it is pression that he was non compus mentus 1956 over ten years since
 the o chiese reserve withholding his temper mccrimmon explained the situation then got authority to approach the was set aside
 and a large number of the chipprovincial authorities the deputy minister of pewas still lead the gypsy life lands mr
 harvey was an old friend of indian andrew strawberry and his group have settled affairs field officials he assured mr
 mccrim in comfortable homes a school has been erected mon that the exchange could be made and all their children
 attend some men are farm another meeting was called for the afternoon ing and have cattle many have cars and
 trucks of may 14 when strawberry agreed to the treaty some 125 souls now have this valuable reserve subject to
 additional terms which included gifts of fine timber and excellent soil plus the mineral of horses cattle and farm equipment
 he was rights and to add to heir fortunes their reserve a good bargainer and got what he wanted is
 in an oil field already the little band has a andrew strawberry was a fine clean cut chap good trust
 fund from sale of leases if oil is with a lean face and acqueline nose he spoke struck there is

 there is continual pressure being exerted on the popular notion of the movement having been the provincial government to make
 increasing grants to municipal governments of monies derived from the rural based persists in part this is because the administration

 of governments rather than building demonstrates that indeed there was an anti urban u the power of the people while
 democracy implies legislation in the interest of the individual citizens bias in social credit policy making and that this which
 does not necessarily mean in the interests of bias reflected the social values that came to governments elected by the

 values that hardened the man ing of large amounts of money in the form of grants for the collecting of

 alberta 3 though his calculation somewhat dubiously included the saskatchewan hospital insurance tax whose alberta counterpart was a private insurance
 scheme which he did not include in alberta s tabulation he also argued that alberta s fairly generous provincial programs
 for the elderly saved municipalities from paying expenditures that would otherwise fall on their shoulders similarly the province was aiding
 municipalities by assuming full responsibility for assistance to transient indigents and by paying half the costs of maintaining patients in
 public wards 3 gerhart also disputed charges that the government was unsympathetic to the special needs of expanding urban centres
 he noted that in 1952 the province had agreed to share half of the tax on fuel oil with municipalities
 to aid them in building roads and bridges five million dollars had also been made available in loans at low

 retained a substantial plurality of the votes of the rising conservative party under peter albertans its position in the two
 major cities was lougheed became the champion of the munici precarious the conservatives virtually tied the palities and particularly the
