 5 message from the colonel of the regiment major general cb ware dso cd the patrician a tribute to the 
 increasing efforts of its editor reflects another interesting and eventful year in the history of the regiment it has been 
 my privilege to sec all regular battalions in their various roles i am certain that all patricians serving or retired 
 would share my pride in their performance first battalion winner this year of that most famed of military trophies the 
 hamilton gault trophy having completed a varied year of operational training ranging from maritime to arctic is now serving as 
 canada s contribution to the united nations force in cyprus lieut colonel hutchinson 0:hutchin 0:son cd finishing an important tour 
 of command goes to washington to be succeeded in cyprus by a young patricia original lieutenant colonel cw hewson cd 
 who joined the regiment on graduation from r m c ii 1958 second battalion under command of lieutenant colonel cb 
 snider mc cd son of a first world war original commemorated the 55th anniversary 0:anni 0:versary of the battle of 
 frezenberg as well as a farewell to germany after twenty years of regimental service with nato this was followed on 
 the 9th of may by exercising our right to the freedom of the city of ypres leaving germany the battalion 
 reformed in winnipeg under the able leadership of lieutenant colonel ajgd de chastclain cd it took part ii the autumn 
 emergency and will be holding special commemorative parades for the 20th anniversary of the battle of kapyong in april when 
 the battalion earned the distinction in 1951 of being the only canadian unit ever to be awarded the us presidential 
 citation it is fitting too that captain em canfield a veteran of the battle will be in kapyong to observe 
 the anniversary and pay tribute to the gallantry of the battalion and those who lost their lives although the regiment 
 s service in germany is officially over the spirit lives on through lieutenant colonel snider who commands the newly formed 
 3rd mechanized commando with many patricias who joined on formation of the new nato unit third battalion joined the regimental 
 order of battle once agai by rcdesignation of ist battalion queen s own rifles of canada through a restructuring of 
 the forces a rcdesignation particularly of a proud battalion cannot be an experience without great emotion but i can say 
 that the battalion immediately and loyally took on their new role they served with distinction in cyprus and will receive 
 their new colours from his excellency the governor general in victoria on the 20th of november 1971 lieutenant colonel tmc 
 marsaw cd commands with great credit the loyal edmonton regiment 4 ppcli continues to play its role as o e 
 of canada s outstanding militia regiments and has had a thoroughly successful training year supported by regular assistance the ties 
 remain close and strong the association and cadets will be covered in detail in this issue the regular battalions watch 
 closely however the progress of both these levels and their strength is of the greatest importance to all who serve 
 both gain strength the association under the devoted guidance of past and present president brigadier coleman and dclalannc held a 
 successful 
 6 first annual meeting in winnipeg and propose this year s in victoria coincident 0:coin 0:cident with the presentation of 
 colours it has been the good fortune or many through the year to see tne widow of our founder mrs 
 a hamilton gault on so many important occasions 0:oc 0:casions she has been with us the last parade in germany 
 presentation of the hamilton gault trophy to 1 ppcli and in our thoughts on so many other occasions truly she 
 helps the patricia family to be the great family that our founder started and intended always to continue in conclusion 
 i am happy to report on my visits to our colonel in chief unfortunately unable to be very active nonetheless 
 her regiment is her first concern it has been my privilege to pledge the undying devotion and loyalty of all 
 patricias to our colonel in chief certainly it is an inspiration 0:inspira 0:tion for all of us to know that 
 we are ever in her thoughts as all patricias are and have been since lady patricia lent her name to

 9 editor s page this editor continues to be amazed if not overwhelmed at the correspondence 0:corres 0:pondence that continues 
 to flow into the regimental increment at times there have been doubts in the minds of my staff and i 
 that we would ever wade through it all but if we have not learned anything else we have learned that 
 there are always ways and means of squeezing out an hour or two more each day we assure all our 
 correspondents that we have mastered this ability and will continue to increase our mastery in the future over the past 
 few years the canadian armed forces have evolved from an original three service complexity to a fully integrated and unified 
 single force that continues to grow in stature to those of us who came from the old forces this has 
 been a period of turmoil and in some cases of great trauma 1 would be less than wise were i 
 not to admit that i have met many facets of this transition with a certain amount of trepidation this transition 
 is now complete within the regimental increment as far as staffing is concerned in july of 1970 the duties of 
 increment clerk were taken over by sergeant tom mockett royal canadian army service corps i will be the first to 
 admit that i had doubts about the ability of a man who had no knowledge of regimental affairs being able 
 to handle the clerical aspects of an organization he had never been exposed to sgt mockett has proved to be 
 an asset to our increment and to our readers and correspondents i can give the assurance that he is capable 
 of handling all routine regimental matters throughout any period that i may be absent from the home station the past 
 year has again afforded me the opportunity to do some travelling 0:travel 0:ling which has been pleasurable to me and 
 i hope beneficial to the regiment 0:regi 0:ment in some degree being able to meet patricias personally is always enlightening 
 and allows them an opportunity to get messages back to the home station and for me to help them in 
 regard to regimental matters the first trip of the year was in april to kingston ontario where the colonel of 
 the regiment mgen c b ware dso cd hosted the 66th meeting of the regimental executive committee the second trip 
 was to germany as a guest of the second battalion for their trooping the colour and farewell to northwest germany 
 ceremonies 0:cere 0:monies the details of these ceremonies can be found in the second battalion report beginning on page 41 
 in early september i was able to pay a short visit to the third battalion in victoria and move on 
 to the second battalion for the 23rd annual general 0:gen 0:eral meeting of the ppclt association on the 12th the 
 minutes of this meeting are recorded beginning on page 151 the regimental museum continues to obtain artifacts and memorabilia and 
 is still growing in size and scope as this is written it is nearing the final stages of being re 
 located in building b 6 here in currie barracks it would be appropriate at this time to express our appreciation 
 to base calgary for the renovations that were made to what is to be a fairly large museum complex with 
 our regimental museum on the ground floor we will shortly be joined by the lord strathcona s horse regimental museum 
 on the second or top floor and the king s own calgary regiment museum in the basement

 pages 64 to 67 i would like to add at this time the appreciation 0:apprecia 0:tion of all ranks of 
 the regiment to the qor of c for their donation to the regimental museum on the 22nd of january 1971 
 lcol d n osborne cd qor of c a former commanding officer officiated at the presentation of a full dress 
 drummer s uniform and silvereen drum this uniform and drum is now on display in the museum and will forever 
 be a reminder of our association with the queens our regimental march was originated to pay homage to the patricias 
 of the first world war by perpetuating three of the more famous songs of that era has anyone seen the 
 colonel tippcrary mademoiselle authority was received on the 18th of september from cfhq for the regiment to adopt as its 
 slow march the music lili marlenc thus our regimental marches perpetuate both world wars at about the same time discussions 
 were commenced for each battalion 0:bat 0:talion to adopt a battalion march the marches selected were first battalion 0:bat 0:talion

 crater located in the vicinity of the vimy memorial captain mary dyck second battalion is the star of the story 
 with a number of first war patricias as outstanding supporting actors this editor is proud that he was able to

 competitive spirit in already wresting two regimental trophies away from the other battalions the louis scott memorial cock o the 
 walk trophy and the hamilton gault skill at arms trophy both previously held by second battalion there are many more 
 items that t would like to report but had oesi conserve space for the more important articles that follow i

 13 the gassing of no 6 platoon 410962 a sidney bruneau qc the 1915 battle of the somme was a 
 very different show from that of a year later it was on the last day of september that we marched 
 up along the canal to hold the village of frise pronounced freeze which did not sound like such a hot 
 spot but a sergeant of the king s royal rifles whom we relieved told us of a trying week with 
 sixty eight casualties the regiment still considerably below strength in spite of the arrival of the first two university companies 
 was responsible for a mile and a quarter of front line there were no support and reserve trenches owing to 
 the drain on army supplies for the battle of loos we had no extra ammunition the regiment had as yet 
 only a single machine gun there were still only a very few bombs and those of the antique hair brush 
 pattern and there were no flares we had to rely on the enemy to light up the darkness the artillery 
 behind us might as well have been non existent for all practical purposes our platoon of 38 men was stretched 
 out over a quarter of a mile of front and sentry posts were as far as a hundred yards apart 
 at this point the distance from the german trenches was about four hundred yards according to the methods of those 
 days a regiment concentrated 0:concen 0:trated its strength at a point where the distance narrowed down to a bare twenty 
 yards within easy range of hand grenades it was a fundamentally weak position for the trench was crossed at both 
 ends by the windings of the canal and its defenders could be isolated by a vigorous attack at these points 
 a mine explosion was expected at any time and in fact the trench was rushed a few weeks later when 
 the mine was sprung and some 900 french were taken prisoners to us it seemed that there was nothing to 
 stop an enterprising enemy breaking through so frail were the defences of civilization in 1915 but fortunately the germans were 
 not at the moment endowed with the imagination 0:imagina 0:tion to take advantage of our almost incredible weakness whatever the 
 faults of our position from a military point of view there was no doubt about its comfort the dug outs 
 might be frightfully flimsy as shelters but as the trench ran through a village they had been luxuriously furnished from 
 the surrounding houses in ours we had a stove with coal available from an abandoned factory nearby and a plentiful 
 supply of wood from the battered church that crossed the line near our post we slept on spring mattresses we 
 ate off excellent china dishes we even had roses on our table an apple orchard in front of us tempted 
 the sentry to stray over the parapet at night the french were far ahead of us in making themselves at 
 home however 0:how 0:ever careless they might be as to the solidity or the cleanliness of their defences 0:de 0:fences 
 for the first time the new drafts were treated to the acute discomforts of lousiness but you can t have 
 everything in the best of worlds and when we were told we would hold the front line without relief for 
 the unheard of term of sixteen days we would not have been greatly upset if we had been told to 
 hold on for the duration save perhaps for the reproach that might be attached to being billeted in such a 
 cushy spot the lovely autumn weather still held it was twilight on the 6th of october and everyone in the 
 trench was at his post for evening stand to 
 14 all was as quiet as it could be on this part of the western front the night before we 
 had received the parcels which had been ordered from england on reaching this poverty stricken somme country and to day 
 we had enjoyed three such hearty meals as we would have been lucky to find in canada for one of 
 our number had a great skill as an amateur cook what a jolly crowd they were we could not have 
 wished for better companions there were seven or eight of us all chatting happily at our sentry post smoking our 
 cigarettes and enjoying their cheering glow in the gathering darkness the talk ran on our luck in having such a 
 happy little home and of course on the old theme of what we were going to do when we got 
 back to canada the usual carrying party had passed out to go down the canal bank to eclusier for the 
 daily rations and the mail corporal rowlands big roily as we called him remembered that he had the platoon s 
 letters in his pocket and set off to catch up with them he had scarcely reached the turning of the 
 trench a few yards away when a strange cowled figure ran sharply into him and we realised with a start 
 that he was wearing a gas helmet god damn it what s the matter roily asked him and we heard 
 the muffled voice of corporal rawsthorne put on your helmets the surprise was complete only that afternoon sergeant mclean had 
 issued the new improved gas helmets but they were anywhere except where they should have been i had left mine 
 hanging in the dug out but i still had the old emergency mask in my inside pocket i leaped down 
 from the firestep loosening my tunic tugging at the pocket would the thing never come out the air around me 
 was suddenly heavy to take a breath was suicide my lungs were bursting finally i tore out the case got 
 my helmet adjusted and breathed with relief i looked over the parapet but could sec nothing in the dusk meanwhile 
 0:mean 0:while the others had rushed back to their dug outs tumbling over one another and holding their breath for 
 dear life literally and now they came back to their post to wait firmly for the attack which would follow 
 when the gas had done its work all around me were the weird cowled figures it looked like a meeting 
 of the ku klux klan our great moment had come the curtain had risen for the last act we knew 
 we were caught in a trap there was not a chance in the world of withstanding an attack but we 
 would sell our lives dearly i thought back to madeleine de verchere whose story had impressed me when i was 
 a child of five i was in the same position now though to be sure there could be no question 
 of torture where we were facing civilized men 1 thought wistfully of someone who would never know how much i 
 had loved her i regretted that it was all over but could not have wished to die in better company 
 there was no joking but no one was frightened sergeant mclean walked along the trench calmly from one post to 
 another with an encouraging 0:encourag 0:ing keep cool men would the beggars never have the guts to come across it 
 was night now there were no stars and it was pitch black oh for a flare to light the space 
 in front but it was not to be had and no rockets shot up from the enemy line which remained 
 grim and still the continual scurry of the rats among the tins and rubbish in front made it all the 
 harder to detect the approach of an enemy suddenly george bowness thought he detected some movement and emptied his 
 15 magazine in a sharp burst of rapid fire but no answer came just then i discovered that i had 
 forgotten to tuck the helmet into my tunic at the back of my neck and shoved it in one or 
 two others felt the gas beginning to seep through and made for the sprinkling solution but alas the pails had 
 been neglected or used for other purposes though this made very little difference as we had been instructed that uric 
 acid would serve in an emergency 0:emerg 0:ency shorty crumb had been caught with a quid ot tobacco in his 
 mouth and was showing signs of serious discomfort at last his muffled voice came through the helmet i ve got 
 to shpit and off came the hood while he shot out a tremendous squirt of tobacco juice he took the 
 wariest of sniffs before putting on his helmet i don t smell no gas he muttered he had hung on 
 to his chew and a few moments later the performance had to be repeated and again he could smell nothing 
 another few minutes passed and the sergeant returned with the welcome order to take off helmets i must admit that 
 i was careful to watch the reactions of two or three others before i ventured to breathe the air once 
 more then of course we began to ask questions had the gas attack been only a trifling annoyance had it 
 been a failure the sentry who had struck the gas alarm was questioned he had certainly seen a fluffy cloud 
 or mist coming over from the german lines and the smell of chlorine gas had been unmistakable someone remembered that 
 corporal chloride as they called the sanitary corporal had just passed through the trench with his assistant jimmy undcrdown who 
 had seemed unusually generous in sprinkling the latrines with chloride of lime everyone was soon satisfied that there had been 
 no gas at all the sentry s imagination had been too powerfully stimulated 0:stimu 0:lated by the chemical just as 
 the wind had blown some light evening clouds in his direction there had been some comic relief as in the 
 case of one of the youngest boys who had made assurance double sure by wearing both the old helmet and 
 the new till he had felt quite sick and was sure the gas was choking him fancy had played some 
 tricks even with seasoned veterans for corporal rawsthorne had seen a line of men coming across in extended order just 
 before the all clear signal but then was it not the old soldiers who had seen the angels at mons 
 more disquieting was the case of one cocky recruit who had always expressed himself with great authority on military matters 
 he had felt the gas seeping through his helmet and begged permission to go back to the rear which sergeant 
 mclean had refused it was days before there was another peep out of him when it became evident that there 
 had been no gas at all but the boys showed their real decency by never saying a word about it 
 and he lived to prove that a man may fail once and be never the worse for it by earning 
 a couple of decorations for outstanding bravery before he was killed for many days there was much fun over the 
 gassing of number six platoon jimmy undcrdown took a lot of credit for having performed this exploit single handed but 
 it had served as a salutary warning of the necessity 0:nec 0:essity of keeping the gas equipment ready at all 
 times and the forty minutes of tense waiting had tested the men s spirit too the more recent arrivals had 
 learned that to be with friends whom you could not leave whatever happened could prove a real source of courage 
 it had indeed been as good as a real gas attack except of course that there had been no gas 
 and no attack

 17 first battalion if 1970 was indicative of the new decade then the remainder of the 70s should indeed be 
 a period of frenetic industry the pressure of activity commenced in january and steadily grew as the days and weeks 
 sped past the area of operations ran the whole gamut of geography from west coast rain forest through prairie grassland 
 to arctic ice cap the various skills brought into play included conventional operations defence of canada operations seaborne operations internal 
 security and winter training in all 1970 proved to be a very busy year ex rapier thrust the convivial joys 
 of welcoming 1970 and the new decade were barely waning when the spectre of winter training at suffield southern alberta 
 s forested fairyland rose before our eyes owing to chinook conditions the winter indoctrination planned for december never came to 
 pass as a result the barrens like wastes of the defence research establishment would be the first exposure to winter 
 s vicissitudes for many members of 1 ppcli the older hands were still shuddering from the extremes of waincon 69 
 training was to encompass winter familiarization navigation helicopter and apc operations and live firing of all company weapons because of 
 a shortage of rp4 rations and the subsequent necessity to serve fresh the battalion was accommodated in general purpose huts 
 company training commenced shortly after the main body arrived by road from calgary on 10 jan the weatherman co operated 
 fully by ensuring that the mercury hovered at the bottom of the glass for the next two weeks with breath 
 crystallizing and unpracticed lungs searing with each inhalation the familiar pull pole and mush rang out in the still air 
 a number of controlled exercises tested the efficiency of the companies 0:com 0:panies and the battalion group as a whole 
 en avant and feuer kampf were live firing exercises beau sabeur and in nubibus practiced apc and helicopter proficiency while 
 exercise au secours was a test of navigational aptitudes in a moon scape setting the battalion exercises wandervogel and raison 
 d etre proved to be the final assessment of the unit s winter capability and particularly stressed maximum flexibility in 
 all rapier thrust proved to be very rewarding in terms of training but in all honesty it is difficult to 
 say much that is favourable about the degree of enjoyment such exercises engender except that it feels so good when 
 it is over between 16 feb and 12 mar 1 ppcli reinforced 1 qor of c now our 3rd battalion

 to fearless five was the construction of a cairn as an aid to navigation for the following serials 5 platoon 
 resorting to its usual resourcefulness and ingenuity built the land mark by erecting the tail section and three body panels 
 from a downed dakota aircraft this marker is now called patricia point and is visible for 8 10 miles in 
 any direction 0:dir 0:ection a platoon from 3 ppcli on the same serial and given a similar task some 6 
 miles away was flabbergasted to see this cairn rise out of the wastes in only a few hours they worked 
 for fourteen hours prying rocks loose from the frozen tundra and managed to amass sufficient material for a 4 foot 
 bump 5 platoon managed to shake off such accusations as dastardly lazy and cheating with great aplomb and replied that 
 you cannot argue with success the second task was a long range recce patrol with the additional requirement of providing 
 radio relay between the 3 ppcli platoon and the firm base at corral harbour the task was completed without incident 
 but all members of 5 platoon will long remember sgt bridger s snow bath outside his tent while only dressed 
 in mukluks and a smile the platoon returned 0:re 0:turned to calgary on may ist hardened veterans of canada s 
 far north 3 platoon a company under lt bruce wilson was next selected to try their hands at eskimo living 
 this platoon almost entirely down easters 0:down 0:east 0:ers was newly graduated from training company and had just achieved pay 
 level 3 proficiency their performance in the barrens was fully up to patricia standards and this in no small way 
 was a reflection of rigorous training and good guidance and instruction by sgt miles j w mcpl eagle t w 
 and cpls gagne n e j and frederick n on 17 aug the platoon departed for the ankle deep ooze 
 of summer on ellet ringnes island and the jagged rock of cornwallis island in the heart of perma frost country 
 on one occasion some platoon members were seen digging for worms apparently they had been told that arctic worms make 
 great bait newfie jokes flew for days after the incident by 1 september 0:septem 0:ber they had taken the worst 
 that the north could dish out but were still smiling albeit faintly their return to calgary was delayed for two 
 days because of blizzard conditions on 22 october a composite support company platoon commanded by capt richard rimmer our tame 
 british exchange officer from the royal green jackets landed in churchill for their first week of arctic familiarization 0:familiariza 0:tion 
 to their surprise it was raining and by the time snow shoes had been strapped on and the toboggans readied 
 the snow had disappeared however the vivid imaginations of sgts davies j e meyers a c and rose j a 
 sufficed as a substitute to the real thing and their winter training proceeded apace after a brief battle with ravenous 
 polar bears who seemed to regard skidoo seats as gourmet entrees the platoon was flown to corral harbour

 of june a quarter guard was mounted by the pioneer platoon cfb calgary warriors senior b league runners up 
 25 for the second phase of the exercise and a surprise snow a leisurely stroll of 30 miles on snowshoes 
 and the construction of another cairn climaxed the exercise all those members of first battalion who participated in new viking 
 will be thinking of this exercise next year by that time up graded to company sized groups while basking in 
 the sun of cyprus training company concurrent with all of the activities being reported here for nine months 1 ppcli 
 also ran a training company for the express purpose of training recruits to pay level 3 standard during the period 
 from february to november approximately 250 new soldiers were exposed to patricia traditions and training capt tony ferguson formed the 
 company with the regimental adjutant capt vern cole as adjutant capt kris reynolds as chief instructor and wo murray j 
 w as csm seven platoons were formed in all and were titled as follows bellewaerde somme ancre heights arras arleux 
 hill 70 and hindenburg line shades of ppcli depot days when the oc was posted to untso maj gary hunt 
 assumed command and capt bob kompf replaced the chief instructor when that worthy gentleman retired all training was conducted in 
 currie and sarcee training area with the exception of heavy weapons firing and the final platoon exercises which were conducted 
 in wainwright the benefits accrued by conducting pay level 3 training at infantry units seems to be considerable the end 
 product is certainly better motivated toward service in the battalion than formerly was the case with graduates of the combat 
 arms school second battalion inherited the mantle of training recruits from 1 ppcli in november and 3 ppcli will follow 
 on after their return from cyprus waincon 70 as may drew to a close the battalion was engaged in fevered 
 activity preparing to deploy to wainwright for the summer concentration on the 28th the advance party departed calgary by road 
 followed two days later by the main body the move seemed all too familiar to the older hands and memories 
 were flooding back as the convoy passed through hardisty but wainwright had changed this was a pristine and green wainwright 
 that greeted our unbelieving eyes gone were all the tank tracks the familiar trails and old buffalo wallows all were 
 reclaimed by nature five years had passed since the last summer concentration owing to the requirement for manning the training 
 company 1 ppcli organization during waincon was based on two rifle companies the first phase of training stressed conventional warfare 
 and sub units concentrated 0:concen 0:trated on perfecting basic drills and command and control in the various phases of war 
 both mechanized and foot borne range work was also stressed and all ranks fired their personal weapons as well as 
 law and maw gpmg and grenades the first phase was confirmed by a series of controlled exercises rising hopes was 
 a platoon test exercise occult seer was a patrolling exercise and ripple chip tested the combat team phase three consisted 
 of a battalion battle group exercise called rabid gopher which employed all sub units in all phases of war over 
 a strenuous three days this training was reasonably arduous and difficult 0:diffi 0:cult and proved to be a good preparation

 much to the joy and relief of all ranks during the period 28 june to 4 july first battalion became 
 a training 0:train 0:ing establishment in order to conduct militia training during the reserve concentration abetted by two rifle companies 
 from 3rd battalion 1 ppcli formed the nucleus for a militia infantry battalion where all positions of control or authority 
 were double banked by patricias lcol w e j hutchinson moved into 1 combat group headquarters as commander of the 
 reserve concentration which included an armoured squadron a field battery a transport company and an engineer troop as well as 
 the infantry battalion and the dco maj bell commanded the infanteers militiamen from the following units were soon gorging at 
 the field kitchens canadian 0:can 0:adian scottish seaforths calgary highlanders loyal edmontons regina rifles rocky mountain rangers the westminsters royal 
 winnipeg rifles camerons lake superior scottish and the north saskatchewan the weather was rather unco operative and proved to be

 vigorous programme was pressed home regardless 0:re 0:gardless which culminated in exercise rowdy revenger in retrospect waincon appeared to be 
 more than the militia had bargained for but all concerned felt that the training was the most worthwhile that they 
 had ever done on july sth the battalion packed its tents like arabs in the night and returned to calgary 
 with lighter hearts and at least a warm sun beating down during waincon 70 two events of note took place 
 on the 10th of june cwo f s dodd relinquished his appointment as regimental sergeant major on his posting to 
 winnipeg and cwo john richardson dcm cd was promoted into that vacancy and ten days later the battalion bade farewell 
 to bgen leonard while welcoming bgen hamilton to the helm of the army of the west the rather remarkable mess

 getting from the drug vallium the drug test on the soldiers was to consist of calculating anxiety prior to and

 30 on saturday the 12th of september 1970 the first battalion exercised its right to the freedom of the city 
 of calgary after having been granted the privelage to march through the streets with bayonets fixed drums beating and colours 
 flying the commanding officer lieutenant colonel wej hutchinson cd has prepared the battalion to do just that 
 31 god a huge fireball a blast wave a ground tremor presto a two hundred foot crater it s ten 
 minutes later and our jaws are still on the ground as a fine glossy fall out rains down on us 
 maj tom clarke it s only equivalent to an eight inch nuclear howitzer explosion that s reassuring after the boffins 
 finish mucking around we can go look at the hole now we can move forward to see the crater and 
 some of the experiments near gz by god those skops support kit overhead protection 0:pro 0:tection actually stood up back 
 in the buses pockets full of fire hardened earth and its all over such a sight not to be forgotten 
 by any of us what was to have been a rather abbreviated leave period anyway was condensed even further for 
 many patricias when the cry rang across the land save the whooping cranes a great conflagration in wood buffalo park 
 in northern alberta in late july resulted in the hurried dispatch 0:dis 0:patch to fort smith of 50 strathconas and 
 two platoons from training company under the command of maj garry hunt after two bone wearying weeks of shoveling earth 
 and dousing fires one hundred more members of 1 ppcli commanded by capt kris reynolds departed calgary on c 130 
 hercules aircraft on 21 august to effect the relief of the original contingent at the height of the fire a 
 total of 200 000 acres had been scorched and a line 25 miles long was burning fiercely with an orange 
 flame while an immense black pall of smoke drifted across the sky for 25 miles this sight will long remain 
 in the memories of the first battalion s smoke eaters freedom of the city of calgary for the second time 
 in two years 1 ppcli exercised its right to the freedom of the city of calgary on saturday september 12th 
 lcol hutchinson responded to the traditional challenge of the city marshal mgen w a howard cd who goes there with 
 the following the first battalion princess patricia s canadian light infantry requesting 0:re 0:questing the ancient privilege and right to 
 march through the city of calgary with drums beating bayonets fixed and colours flying the city marshal conducted the co 
 into his worship the mayor s office shortly after the official party returned to the dais in front of city 
 hall where a regimental commanding officer s pennant was presented to the city of calgary his worship mayor rod sykes 
 then addressed the guard of honour and the assembled multitude you have now been back with us for over a 
 year and our citizens have come to know you again your battalion has entered into community affairs and has been 
 active in athletic and charitable works the ppcli band has played throughout the city in many concerts you have worked 
 hard in maintaining your professional skills i congratulate you as fine citizens of calgary and canada the guard then gave 
 three cheers for the city of calgary and his worship mayor rod sykes following the fixing of bayonets the colours 
 were marched on and given due honour then the co commanded bandmaster 0:band 0:master let beat the drums the guard 
 of honour commanded by maj g d hunt then marched off down the bth avenue mall in a symbolic march 
 through the streets of calgary that same afternoon all of the officers messes in cfb calgary joined with the home 
 station mess for the annual garden party in currie baracks rather brisk weather did little to deter the good spirits 
 which pervaded the mess and all who participated were satisfied that this two year tradition will continue for sometime 
 32 mrs db gault widow of the founder of the regiment is shown immediately following her presentation of the hamilton 
 gault trophy for marksmanship to lieutenant colonel wej hutchinson cd commanding officer first battalion mrs gault s presentation is being 
 replied to by brigadier general cja hamilton mbe cd commander 1 combat group 
 33 hamilton gault trophy early in september great joy reigned in the bn with the announcement that 1 ppcli had 
 won the hamilton gault trophy for marksmanship competed for by infantry battalions of the canadian forces plans were hastily formulated 
 to bring mrs dorothy gault wife of our founder to calgary for the presentation ceremony and 21 september was settled 
 on for this propitious occasion accompanied by bgen g g brown cd now chief of staff operations at fmc headquarters 
 montreal and col e m x macgregor mc cd chief of infantry mrs gault arrived at mccali field via falcon 
 jet on the 21st where she was met by bgen hamilton and the commanding officer at 1400 hrs mrs gault 
 and bgen hamilton inspected the battalion which was formed up on the currie parade square on this occasion the first 
 battalion was dressed in combat clothing and fighting order the same order of dress used when firing for the trophy 
 following the inspection 0:ins 0:pection the commander introduced mrs gault to the assemblage the founder s wife then addressed troops 
 it is such a happy time to be with you particularly happy and proud am i to present my husband 
 s trophy for marksmanship and to see it going to his beloved regiment to win a competition like this takes 
 a lot of doing and you have done it well done first battalion you have a high regimental honour to 
 keep up and you have a tremendous country to serve the mark of perfection 0:per 0:fection is not only in 
 marksmanship but in all professional skills i have travelled over 5 000 miles to present this trophy to encourage perfection 
 after the presentation of the trophy miss frances brignell daughter of sgt brignell r a presented mrs gault with a 
 bouquet of roses the battalion then marched off the square to the lilting medley which comprises the regimental march stirringly 
 played by the massed ppcli band and ist battalion corps of drums mrs gault then toured the regimental museum before 
 going to the junior ranks club to take tea with all ranks of the battalion this inovative occasion was very 
 successful and mrs gault appeared to be just as interested in talking with the soldiers as the latter were in 
 conversing with our founder s wife official activities ended that night when mrs gault generals brown and hamilton and their 
 good wives and col macgregor joined with some of the officers and their ladies in a delightful informal dinner at 
 the mess next morning the falcon departed for montreal and a short but highly memorable visit was over exercise pool

 pool shark i and 11 both seaborne defence of canada operations which were to be conducted between 27 september and 
 8 october capt lew mackenzie the battalion operations officer reports 0:re 0:ports as follows somehow an exercise never seems quite 
 so bad in retrospect in fact the misery experienced during the exercise is usually directly proportional to the volume of 
 the conversation at the post cease fire drink up applying this somewhat suspect formula to the two pool sharks they 
 must have been both successful and physically difficult 
 34 scenarios have always provided a forum for frustrated military authors to vent their literary talents on a captive audience 
 and this was no exception in this thrilling table a small band of fantasians had landed at bamfield 0:bam 0:field 
 on vancouver island and captured a pacific cable station a company dealt with this problem on pool shark i while 
 b company ventured forth on a similar mission on pool shark 11 each company deployed to esquimalt by ci3o hercules 
 out of mccall field and all aspects proceeded smoothly until we descended on cfb esquimalt on a week end if

 if they make h hour on saturday morning capt bob mac lean 2ic a company tried in vain to initiate 
 some action on the part of the base staff only to be thwarted at every turn when the question was 
 asked how do i get transport the reply was well there s a duty cpl at base transport but he 
 s not allowed to answer the phone on week ends once the companies had extricated themselves from base esquimalt and 
 ventured onto the destroyer escort hmcs mackenzie an atmosphere 0:atmos 0:phere of true professionalism descended over the task force if 
 nothing else pool shark served to further cement the bonds between the sea and land invironmental representatives even the navy 
 soon adjusted their vocabulary and port starboard bow stern bridge and galey became left right sharp end blunt end upstairs 
 and mess hall the two day cruise to the exercise area was far from wasted orientation 0:orienta 0:tion tours briefings 
 and the most effective deep sea fishing with 200 pound depth charges kept everyone busy and gainfully employed movies were 
 available during the evenings and rumour has it that the rape scene in harold robbins the adventurers was replayed a 
 dozen times in the war room the t defaye cup is presented to the winners of the french grey cup 
 competition 
 35 on the third day the fog cleared to reveal off the starboard side the most miserable shoreline this side 
 of the gulf of tonkin observing the landings from mackenzie was almost humorous once the troops hit the beach they 
 disappeared immediately into secondary jungle the deadfall was up to six feet of the forest floor and tight rope walking 
 would have been valuable pre exercise training platoon commanders soon found that it was impossible to practice sub unit tactics 
 when everyone was executing his own balancing act on his own personal log going to ground was relatively easy as 
 all that was required was a one inch side step and you disappeared for up to an hour once the 
 dead fall had devoured an unsuspecting 0:un 0:suspecting body it took up to thirty minutes to get him back on 
 top and send him on a new balancing act movement was painfully slow and major john hunter when asked how 
 far he was from his radio replied about fifty or sixty light years both companies were successful in reaching and 
 securing the cable station third battalion provided a lively enemy tasked with a do or die defence of the installation 
 the terrain provided many frustrating experiences 0:experi 0:ences because recognition was next to impossible friendly sub units attacked each other 
 and well too while the enemy searched in vain for someone to fight eventually all came together at the final 
 objective and everyone rid himself of his ammunition after forty eight hours of coping with some of the most difficult 
 terrain in the world all participants were glad to touch the metal bulkheads 0:bulk 0:heads of hmcs mackenzie a hot 
 meal and the daily rum issue soon produced the normal post exercise recounting of such stirring tales as mcpl pelkey

 where most of the battalion officers were able to bend his willing ear on 16 october the war measures act 
 was proclaimed all members of the battalion were immediately confined to the calgary area and intensive internal security training suddenly

 41 second battalion the second battalion had a most eventful year in 1970 as we experienced 0:experi 0:enced a major 
 transition the first six months were spent saying auf wiedersehn to germany while the last six involved a lot of 
 hard work in setting up the battalion in our old pre war home station of winnipeg the new year started 
 off with a bang as all the messes had new year s parties which lasted til the approach of dawn 
 the great reckoning came the next morning as the officers attended the new year s levee it was the last 
 levee to be held in germany and every german functionary for miles around came to pay his compliments needless to 
 say vast quantities of moose milk were drunk during january and february the big news in the battalion was sports 
 in particular the hemer rebels this hockey team consisting predominantly 0:predomin 0:antly of patricias skated its way through excellent competition 
 to become the zone 9 champions the zone 9 finals were followed as closely by everyone 0:every 0:one in the 
 brigade as people in canada follow the stanley cup and it was great for unit morale to see our team 
 going to canada for the armed forces championships unfortunately disaster struck at camp borden and the rebels were defeated by 
 one goal in the championship game during the same period the battalion volleyball team also worked its way to the 
 top of the heap in zone 9 they too represented the brigade in canada but fared no better than the 
 rebels the other big athletic endeavour during this period was the oberjoch ski school called ex jambe brise this school 
 was set up by the brigade to train soldiers in the art of downhill skiing the battalion sent approximately 75 
 men on the week long course the ski slopes were great and everyone learned a lot but don t talk 
 to wo dave o brien about it he turned right when he should have turned left and spent the next 
 two months on crutches to prove it on march 17 the battalion marked lady patricia s birthday with a great 
 round of celebrations in the morning an assortment of sports were played the big drawing card was the apc rodeo 
 as dozens of soldiers cheered the drivers on it was really impressive to watch the men handle the aluminum monsters 
 in and out of tight corners a lot of drivers found that an apc is wider than they thought lunch 
 was served in the men s mess to the accompaniment of the band of the third battalion royal green jackets 
 no one who was present will forget their fantastic rendition of delilah between the end of march and mid april 
 it was back to business again as the companies went through individual three day exercises in patrolling and defense canada 
 based readers may not believe it but the biggest challenge at this time was snow the 1969 70 winter in 
 europe was one of those ones and that meant two to three feet of snow in the highlands of the 
 sauerland the troops had a good preview of canadian winters without winter equipment april also included two british corps cpz 
 s ex spring sales and ex dial one as always these were both interesting and educational 0:education 0:al for those 
 involved

 climax during the period 7 15 may during these nine days the patricia s trooped the colour sent a l

 in internal security training due to the relevant problem in quebec at the time this consisted of training in crowd 
 control cordon and search and the guarding of installations we were somewhat in a state of limbo because the unit 
 was ready to leave for the annual weapon classification in shilo and at the same time expected to be called 
 east on a moment s notice however in spite of it all we boarded the buses on the 28th of 
 october and proceeded to shilo for our first unit get together in the field since our return from germany the

 together was especially beneficial for morale followmg their pistol classification the officers participated in an aftercoon 0:after 0:coon devoted to 
 orienteering which proved to be a refreshing experience for most the exercise started with capt bill aikman s briefing in

 number of people somewhat disgruntled with the game but once having finished and complimented with a hot rum toddy all 
 was forgotten until the results of the timings were posted that is the top three were captains mary dyck bill 
 macmillan and gary whiting the main purpose of shilo was to have the battalion s members com pete for the

 within the unit in the skill at arms was bravo company with a remarkable average 0:aver 0:age of 154 1

 crater history on 19 december 1916 between 0130 and 0145 hours the 172 tunneling 0:tun 0:neling company exploded three mines 
 on the lips of tidza crater on vimy ridge the enlarged crater was in the centre of the princess patricia 
 s canadian light infantry sector so the commanding officer colonel agar adamson requested that it be called patricia the request 
 was sanctioned by first army command and a sign designating the crater was erected by the pioneer platoon discovery in 
 november 1969 during the armistice day ceremonies capt dyck pioneer platoon commander 2 ppclt went to vimy ridge memorial as 
 part of a unit guard of honour while touring the preserved battleground he noticed that the craters in the area 
 in which he had determined patricia crater should be were all marked with signs other than patricia later in the 
 day during a conducted tour of the battleground the guide was asked if he knew the location of the subject 
 crater he took the contingent to a location which could not possibly have been in the ppcli sector and pointed 
 to a large depression declaring it to be patricia crater a french speaking member of the contingent had overheard one 
 guide telling the other in french take them to that large one in the woods that ll impress them or 
 words to that effect at this point capt dyck resolved to locate beyond a reasonable doubt the real patricia crater 
 research research into the project began with the local library the official history of the regiment and a visit to 
 the imperial war museum in london conclusive evidence was not obtained from any of these sources although the head of 
 the printed books section at the war museum later sent a map reference which turned out to be absolutely correct 
 once the map had been located during the second battalion trooping in germany on 8 may 70 capt dyck discussed 
 the project with the regimental adjutant capt vern cole capt cole immediately took up the challenge and realizing that the 
 battalion had only three months left in germany sent out a barrage of letters to vet 
 60 erans that were associated with the regiment during the famous battle for the ridge realizing the urgency of the 
 matter the veterans replied to the call for assistance in their characteristic co operative and unselfish manner mr percy boxall 
 formerly of the 49th battalion now residing in surrey england further disseminated the call for information and sent a sketch 
 of the crater line which was very accurate and helpful mr ray perry montreal who served with the 7 brigade 
 trench mortor battery which supported the captain md dyck poses in patricia crater after having planted the sign designating the 
 crater see page 59 regiment during most of its tour on the ridge and also during the successful assault on 
 9 10 april 1917 most generously offered to undertake a trip to vimy ridge to assist in identifying the crater 
 if necessary in addition mr perry sent several large photostatic copies of the map of the crater line last but 
 certainly not least in importance mr george hancox also formerly 0:form 0:erly of the 49th battalion now living in victoria 
 8 c sent the final conclusive 0:con 0:clusive evidence which was an original trench map of vimy ridge and the 
 same one that was referred to capt dyck by the imperial war museum conclusion on 15 aug 70 capt dyck 
 and wo gouiliet went to vimy ridge to locate the crater and mark it with a hardwood sign which had 
 been made by pte holzknecht of the pioneer platoon the correct crater was located by taking a bearing off the 
 trench map from the one and only crater to be found on the enemy side of the trench line to 
 patricia crater adding the magnetic variation and pacing the distance on the ground for the information of anyone that has 
 visited vimy ridge or for those that intend on doing so patricia crater is the most southerly crater on the 
 preserved battleground and was formerly marked as montreal crater

 to the regular order of battle of the canadian forces after an absence of 16 years three months and 18 
 days its history is brief but not without distinction for those who have not read colonel g r stevens excellent 
 regimental history volume 111 the following is a summary of the chapters dealing with the third battalion the year 1950

 second battalion departed in march lcol corbould left to command the 25th brigade reinforcement group in lapan and was replaced 
 by lcol h f wood cd in may the battalion left fort lewis to spend the summer season in camp 
 wainwright alberta in august 274 officers and men left the third battalion to join the first which was replacing the 
 second in korea as september came some temporary winter quarters were found in camp borden and later the unit moved 
 to camp ipperwash here at last the third found a good camp with an ample training area and soon was 
 at full strength in april 1952 the battalion moved back to wainwright but this time with a difference their turn 
 in korea was rapidly approaching more weapons and ammunition became available and training took on a new meaning the battalion 
 left for korea and landed in puson harbour on 28 october by 8 november the third had relieved the first 
 battalion in a support position behind the 28th commonwealth brigade the first taste of action for the third came very 
 shortly after the first battalion black watch of 28th brigade came under rather heavy attack from the chinese b and 
 c companies of third battalion reinforced the black watch during the battle and stayed several days under their command during 
 this brief action the third recorded its first casualties with five killed and nine wounded on 1 december 1952 the 
 battalion relieved the black watch on the hook positions and remained until relieved by the rcr on the 28th various

 canadian guards and many of his officers and men joined him in the new unit others went to first and 
 second patricias while still others joined the first battalion the queen s own rifles of canada on 19 october 1954 
 the name of third battalion was heard again after one of the numerous militia re structurings the 49th battalion loyal 
 edmonton regiment was affiliated as third battalion ppcli militia the loyal eddy s had a long and valuable association with 
 ppcli during the two world wars a new relationship soon developed the strong family bonds of friendship and rivalry that 
 produce lasting ties on 26 april 1970 the first battalion queen s own rifles of canada was removed from the 
 regular order of battle and became the third battalion princess patricia s canadian light infantry this battalion had over the

 welcome you to the patricia family we are conscious of your great traditions and fine record through one hundred and 
 ten years of service in war and peace to our country we know well your determination and fighting spirit as

 the regiment is the foundation and the home upon which all our finest qualities of loyalty courage and fighting spirit 
 are centred so i believe it well that the system remains and although at this time the 40r of c

 68 the feu de joie and rebadging ceremonies were barely over when the unit was requested to provide a 50 
 man guard to participate in the liberation of holland memorial service at the b c legislative buildings on 6 may 
 1970 with a ceremonial parade just completed one would think a little 30 minute parade would pose no problems this 
 wasn t quite true all of the drill movements the marching and the commands had been in rifles tradition and 
 contrary to the old cliche that the timing never changes the timing had changed after several hours of square bashing 
 under mwo vardy it was agreed that the standard of drill was acceptable even the rsm agreed on arrival at 
 the appointed place and time it was discovered that a change in format would occur the pipes and drums of 
 the canadian scottish princess mary s regiment wished to perform an abbreviated sunset ceremony instead of standing in one spot 
 the troops were informed of what had occurred and told simply to obey orders while the guard commander played it

 long flight that started our six month operational tour of duty ia cyprus we were a mixed bag of men 
 representative of the battalion as a whole there were the old hands who had been to cyprus once even twice 
 before who showed very little interest in the prqspect of six months of inactive peace keeping duties then there were 
 the younger chaps who had never been to an operational theatre before and were excited about it but were trying 
 to look nonchalant nonetheless 0:nonethe 0:less we took our mixed feelings aboard a d left victoria behind twenty two hours

 dry looking the same colour as the summer sun on a dusty afternoon the predominant orange tinge to everything 0:every

 waiting for us was a welcoming committee from i rcr looking very blase in their bush gear and summer tans 
 we tried unconsciously to show them that they could relax that we were here lo take over their problems but 
 they did not seem very impressed they fired us through an efficient clearing in process they drove us to a 
 place of ugly orange stone buildings with corrugated tin roofs very operational looking then it was into vehicles and out 
 to the company areas and the excitement came right back again there they were blue un op s just like 
 that picture and there were armed canadian soldiers standing right out in front of them and there were armed greek 
 and turk cypriot soldiers too behind very impressive fortifications rather than mere sentry boxes all this blatant militarism and outright 
 signs of war made us very aware of ourselves as soldiers we the first timers we were impressed for awhile 
 the rcr briefed us and left the opposing factions tested us and quit we were too good for them too 
 quick too much on the ball and slowly we began to find out un soldiers have tans because they have 
 a lot of time to lie in the sun the opposing factions quit testing us because they had finished their 
 token hostilities for another six months the impressive greek and turk cypriot fortifications might stand up to a 7 62

 to joke around to alleviate the boredom breaks in routine came with visiting newsmen radio men and vlp s ll 
 was hard lo tell who was more interested in whom they in us or we in them the newsmen were 
 good for us they would get the big picture briefing from the general and the operations stall then they would 
 visit the actual area of recent conflict they would be led around the danger areas by the public information officer 
 or one of the local platoon commanders 0:com 0:manders taking precious time away from his troops officers began to develop 
 operational swagger and would cooly caution the camera buff to take no pictures here i d hate to see you 
 shot the un sentry in the tour area would give a crashing salute to the amusement of the nearby national 
 guard or turk cypriot fighter sentries and would explain specifically how he risks his life along the green line for 
 his country it sounded pretty good and both the newsmen and the platoon commander would be impressed by the sentry 
 the platoon commander making a mental note to check and see if the rest of his men were as hardworked 
 as this one seemed to be the newsmen or vlp s would then get a briefing on company level smooth 
 tongued statisticians poured out their fare and slides flashed on and off with the precision of a timed fire plan 
 all calculated to impress and doing just that after the companies had finished with them they were passed back to

 happened the co discussed rotation the officers discussed rotation the nco s discussed it and the men discussed it the

 80 this time though we were all veterans it may have been a frustrating job incomprehensible to some and unreasonable 
 to others but we did it some of us may have thought that we didn t do much but to 
 the folks back home it meant a lot so that is something anyway in six months we had collected quite 
 a bunch of war stories all completely true of course and after a time the memories will soften and cyprus 
 will be a pleasant place in our minds when 1 ppcli gets off the plane at nicosia airport they will 
 be a mixed lot some excited some knowing what it will be like like our predecessors we will be waiting 
 efficient and smart in our cf uniform to turn over the job to them we are the veterans now of 
 a job that takes its own kind of toll it is frustrating seemingly meaningless at times and mentally fatiguing at 
 all times to stand alone on an outpost for several hours at a time is a suitable form of torture 
 and to have done this without a let down for six endless months is quite an achievement we deserve to 
 be proud support company this review of support company must in the main reflect the tour of duty with the 
 united nations forces in cyprus indeed in retrospect support company emerged as a distinctive community after arriving in this country 
 the company took over from the first battalion the royal canadian 0:can 0:adian regiment the normal tasks that are associated 
 with logistic support but also perhaps because cyprus is cyprus other chores or tasks which were peculiar to living and 
 working in this island nation in general one would have wished that the company was only responsible 0:res 0:ponsible for

 problem facing the new team bulging with energy and determination 0:deter 0:mination which they could have traded for a smattering 
 of experience was is anyone hearing our efforts answer no the new contingent was not geared to tuning in a 
 promotional scheme was needed first thoughts went to newspaper adds but the 2 000 read 5 00 request for promotion 
 was turned down due to a shortage of funds the next step of course was to seek assistance of a 
 real swinger el gestetner just what was to be promoted cancon cavalcade 602 khz or the cbc nyet tom and 
 bob wanted something catchy something the listeners could identify with 
 87 about this time little signs started to appear around the unit radio room and signal platoon quarters take a 
 bubba to dinner give a bubba for xmas big bubba is watching you big bubba radio was born gestetners cranked 
 their approval in various corners of cancon flooding sub units with slogans directions and considerable threats of what big bubba 
 would do extend their tour watch them with a careful eye etc if they didn t listen the listening audience 
 acquired big bubba had to now find ways and means of maintaining their interest a re vamping of the show 
 was underway add a contest here sprinkle lightly with music a dash of spirits a salute to a worthy group 
 mix with humorous dedications beat with a comedy spot and call it big bubba radto the result a healthy competition 
 between the corps of drums and the signal platoon to see who could win the most money for the bubba 
 contest the signal platoon detailed the night shift operator to write entries the band purchased a rubber stamp my answer 
 is signed the bandrats and applied to an assembly line the signallers countered by programming their answer through the unit 
 teletype at 60 words per mm for a few hours with all this corruption going on and a shortage of 
 paper developing big bubba limited the entries to one per person another result of the show we would hope is 
 that it assisted in maintaining morale of the contingent 0:con 0:tingent seeing as though big bubba received cards from saudi 
 arabia and yes even canada not to mention local people we assume that goal read aim was achieved we shall 
 close now with words from big bubba remember when you have those days where nothing goes right and you think 
 the whole world is against you you are probably right the mortar platoon life for we mortar rats could be 
 termed hectic for want of a better word the past eight months may dec 70 has seen a number of 
 changes in personnel and roles after our last rifles parade we got down to some of the finer points of 
 preparing for our summer camping trip to western canada s fun sun training area camp wainwright it was during may 
 that we suffered our first losses sgt russ moore received a well deserved promotion to wo and went to a 
 rifle coy sgts ken umpherville and roy charron came up with summer jobs working with militia and cadets as they 
 are old vets i m sure they could stand to miss one concentration mcpl jim king left for a rifle 
 coy mcpl ivan mcphee took a jump course and was posted to canada s elite the canadian airborne regiment and 
 pte wayne bolduc became a driver in transport section somewhere along the line we picked up our new pi wo 
 wo wally scharf to replace wo ernie vardy who was promoted to mwo to us waincon was the first time 
 that we could really settle down and do some serious training as a platoon with our new gang the first 
 few weeks were devoted to section and group training in all phases of war with a good dose of map 
 reading thrown in our dashing pi 2ic capt rag duncan straightened most everyone out i think we made mistakes but 
 they taught us a great deal most provided a good 
 88 laugh after it was all over though some won t agree our cpo s mcpls bruce kahns and stan 
 faulkner as well as the section corporals cpls wes everitt and john chaykoski earned their salt it s quite a 
 feat to listen to two radios read a map and command your section all at the same time not to 
 mention the possibility of plotting a target as well especially if a fire mission is coming in over the fire 
 net and some idiotic message over the mortar net the majority of our command personnel were relatively new at it 
 all but they pulled it off with flying colours even though there were times when they had slight mental blocks 
 as to where they were or went down the wrong axis or even pointed the mortars the wrong way and 
 shot our own troops up just to mention a few happy memories in the end it all paid off and 
 to confirm our mistakes we conducted a live shoot for three days i m sure we tried to annihilate everything 
 we could find a few times even ourselves on a few occasions the wind was rather touchy and one wasn 
 t quite sure where the next round might land sure keeps you on your toes but we tried everything we 
 ever talked about plus some things that we thought just might work it was the most rewarding part of our 
 summer once the exercises started we were on the move as normal the mfc s were shuttled about like gypsies 
 as the situation required it s rather demoralizing when you get the feeling no one really cares where you ride 
 or whether you ride just be there you could get an inferiority complex with the last angry shots fired we 
 heard the famous call exercise cease fire mortars re grouped and on the return journey the truth about what really 
 happened came to light one day was taken up cleaning stores and packing for the drive home we left in 
 the wee hours in high spirits but no sooner did we leave the concentration area than we experienced a command 
 map reading problem our fearless leader lt rags duncan missed the out route and we were forced to journey many 
 miles south to get out of the area insult was to be added to injury when he turned the wrong 
 way and we headed for saskatchewan luckily we had asa cpl who soon discovered the error and turned our merry 
 band around to the right direction after running out of gas a few times we finally made calgary not long 
 after we arrived word came that we would be leaving early the next morning for chilliwack it seems some flower 
 children were going to 1 iberate stanley park for the people and we were to go to the rescue after 
 a few days of cleaning and administration we were off on 30 days leave everyone came back for they knew 
 that if they failed they wouldn t be allowed to go to cyprus and of course everyone wanted to go 
 well not everyone those with the best stories stayed home time was running short and things were to be done 
 our stores had to be turned in training had to be done and we were to reorganize again pte eddy 
 chase was married and took his release to go back to school cpl joe savoie transferred to civic street cpl

 part of the green line we also have an outpost to man at night on the nicosia golf course we 
 share the area with the turk cypriot fighter bunkers in the 6th hole should make for an interesting game before 
 we knew it christmas was upon us and it also marked the halfway point after a delicious christmas dinner the 
 annual academy awards were presented a number of the platoon won the bald spot of the year award cpl moe 
 dulmagc was hastily seconded to the job of santa clause for the kyrenia crippled children s hospital moe later accompanied 
 the co on a visit to all the outposts on christmas eve an inside report on rceme activities to many 
 people in the battalion our rceme attachcd personnel commonly referred to as the l a d light aid detachment are 
 there to service their vehicles although vehicles play an important part of the l a d task there is much 
 more if you follow me from the entrance to its exit this is what you would find on your right 
 as you enter the compound what appears to be a junk yard is wo doug pichette s territory his bicycle 
 repair shop with a little bit of patience and lots of skill he manages to salvage parts of broken down 
 bicycles and reconstruct a few bikes which arc urgently needed for patrols and swans directly across from the bicycle manufacturer 
 is our signals and instrument shop and without them to fix our movie projectors life could be quite dull proceeding 
 further is the rceme control office where mwo ernie clapson hangs his hat and that s about all he ensures 
 that his corporals and privates do the job and he issues out the occasional 48 hour pass if all is 
 satisfactory wo sam schnarr can sometimes be seen leaving this office to offer his expert advice should the occasion arise

 can scrounge it seems that their people arc always going on leave and work just keeps piling up ptcs mike

 feel good that they were needed the electrical section hidden away in the comer cannot be forgotten cpls charlie charlewood 
 and pete maximuk have their hands full rewiring 0:re 0:wiring trucks repairing electrical heaters and generators plus a thousand and 
 one other jobs we cannot forget our rcoc friends who have their spare parts bits and pieces to keep us 
 functioning it is always a pleasure to ask either sgt ed macdonald or mcpl mac mckay for an important part 
 for as they assure you there is none left in stock their smiles are sure to get to you around 
 the corner is a busy spot usually the busiest place in the l a d the welding shop run by

 johnson to the left of the compound exit is the grease and lube pit handled by cpl tony arsenault and 
 pte eli waskul they were loaned to us by bn tpt and without them our jobs could not possibly be 
 completed in time as oil changes and grease jobs are frequent and time consuming alongside the lube pit is the 
 last remaining section to be mentioned vehicle inspection commonly referred to as the 2208 section here every three months each 
 and every vehicle is thoroughly inspected for possible failures and noted by mcpl john clendenning and cpl rod easterby these 
 inspections take around three hours to complete and then the vehicle is sent to the repair section for action midnight 
 mass in ayios jacovos church capt j hassett chaplain rc canconcyp it was at the end of sep 70 while 
 visiting canadians at un observation 0:observa 0:tion posts on the green line that i first noticed ayios jacovos church it 
 looked like it had been just a small christian chapel at one time so i went inside to investigate half 
 of the roof had gone the floor had at least a foot to two feet of rubble on it there 
 were no doors or windows left in many places on the walls plaster had cracked and fallen revealing the stone 
 beneath 0:be 0:neath the rubble on the floor had been there so long that grass was growing and in one 
 place a two foot high shrub was struggling for moisture it was a gloomy shabby dismal and lonely place yet 
 somehow appealing perhaps because it was a church like a stable with no doors to shut people in or out 
 just openings as early as october it appeared to me to be an ideal site for midnight mass on christmas 
 eve it would be central for canadians staying on pophos street in ayios kassianos school and the nearby suburbs also 
 it was on the green line between greek cypriot and turk cypriot outposts 0:out 0:posts where canadians spend all of 
 their working hours maintaining the peace finally its condition was a visible reminder of our need for the christ child 
 the prince of peace both the greek cypriot and turk cypriot officials agreed that un troops could use the chapel 
 on christmas eve in preparation for this men from both city and suburbia companies of the 3 ppcli cleaned the 
 rubble from the floor of the chapel a pathway was made outside to the main entrance and the rubberized tarpaulin 
 top to a swimming pool was spread over the main gaps in the roof coloured lights were then strung inside 
 with a large white spotlight set in the top of the dome by december 24th all was ready and yet 
 there was an air of uncertainty perhaps no one would come by 9 30 p m i still had no 
 sermon ready after 2000 years of christmas it is hard to say something relevant or profound that is still fresh 
 especially when speaking to soldiers for soldiers usually feel and perhaps rightly so that they have heard so much foolishness 
 from politicians preachers and officers that when sermon time comes they automatically switch off their receivers while they daydream 0:day

 92 at 11 00 p m men arrived with benches from their mess hall and at 11 30 with only 
 a handful of men around a fog began to settle on the area the coloured lights looked softer now and 
 shadows in and out of the old church seemed ghostly but not unfriendly gradually the chapel began to fill and 
 having set up a small altar under the dome i prepared it for the mass a soldier from the band 
 played the glockenspele from behind the alter all the old christmas carols that we knew so well something strange and 
 wonderfully right began to happen the men sang loud and strong and their voices filled the gloom and chased all 
 sadness from the chapel to offset the chill of the night some of them had prudently taken the precaution of 
 absorbing various antifreezes but that does not completely 0:com 0:pletely explain the matter a mood of intimacy of being at 
 home here in a cold empty ruined chapel thousands of miles from canada seemed to grow on us all and 
 the canadian male that non singing member of the human species sang loudly clearly and enjoyably the mass with its 
 readings and gospel flowed on with a life of its own the consecration and a recorded fanfare of trumpets was 
 played after which the mood of silent and reverent peace of being home continued it was a christmas i and 
 they will never forget not the least reason being the setting of the little chapel on the green line ayios 
 jacovos kyrenia red cross hospital for crippled children the hospital is located on the eastern outskirts of the city of 
 kyrenia at present there are thirty children of turkish and greek origin undergoing treatment early during the summer of 1964 
 members of first battalion the royal 22nd regiment undertook to do some minor repairs to the hospital this work was 
 done during off duty time and since then each unit in the canadian contingent has continued to assist the hospital 
 in many ways repairs of a minor nature parties held for the children and donations of money to assist in 
 the opperation of the hospital are a few of the ways canadian troops have helped these unfortunate but very cheerful 
 children two parties were held this year in the hospital the first a hallowe en party hosted by the sergeants 
 mess the corps of drums was in attendance and supplied some excellent entertainment which the kids enjoyed immensly following the 
 band concert the usual ice cream cake cookies and pop were served and needless to say very quickly disappeared into 
 thirty little stomachs the christmas party was sponsored by the junior ranks club and although the turkish cypriots do not 
 celebrate christmas as we do the children in the hospital looked forward to seeing santa clause as much as our 
 own kids santa ably portrayed by cpl dulmage distributed gifts to each child it was a heart warming sight for 
 those of us in attendance to watch those excited youngsters open their presents during the early part of our tour 
 the commanding officer agreed to allow the sergeants mess to run a raffle to raise money for the hospital the 
 prize was an early return to canada mcpl day of suberbia coy was the winner and returned to canada on 
 5 jan 71 all ranks of the battalion feel that our efforts in assisting the children in the hospital is 
 a worthwhile cause and it is hoped that future contingents will continue the programme 
 93 i was a public information officer with 3 ppcli or above and beyond the call of duty late in 
 january a rather bent and tragic looking figure stumbled off an aircraft at ottawa s uplands airport the once tall 
 proud figure was hardly recognizable to his wife and children who waited anxiously in the terminal building the face crinkled 
 with two well defined bags under the eyes belied the man s 31 years and provided his wife with some 
 evidence of the ordeal which he had obviously been through what happened shouted the distraught woman i ve just finished 
 a tour as pio with 3 ppcli in cyprus he mumbled through cracked lips it all started when the first 
 of the third battalion patricias landed in nicosia and shouted where s the party i made the mistake of telling 
 them rather proudly that as the public information officer pio i had already made some good contacts in cyprus and 
 could tell them where to go later as we were sipping a soothing brandy sour in one of nicosia s 
 more spectacular clubs i made my second mistake i casually mentioned that i was air element although being a brylcream 
 boy had always seemed to be of a certain advantage particularly when trying to impress members of the fairer sex 
 it never seemed to impress the pats remember our airlift from norway last year my wife got bumped in trenton 
 last week d air force try as i might to explain that i was sure there was a reasonable explanation 
 0:ex 0:planation and that the air element was doing all it could to support them i was doomed to failure 
 each time a miniscule event occurred concerning those terrible blue boys the full weight of responsibility came crashing down on 
 my already weakening shoulders i say already weakening because this battalion seemed to be so very popular newsmen upon hearing 
 that the pats had landed in cyprus threw toothbrush and typewriter in bag and rushed by first available aircraft 0:air 
 0:craft to the scene of the action filled with pride i would steer these makers of heros through a series 
 of briefings and visits to all corners of the pats area of responsibility and duty bound i stumbled along for 
 another all night and most often early morning session in beautiful downtown nicosia having averaged at least one hour s 
 sleep a night but full of enthusiasm 0:en 0:thusiasm for the work being done by our troops these hercules of 
 the fourth estate stumbled aboard the big bird each week muttering i m going to sleep for a week alas 
 for this poor body there was to be no rest for as each group departed there was another to take 
 its place ready to crowd 25 hours of work and pleasure into each day where s the pio shouted ops 
 b during a co s o group down at the tailors having two inches taken out of his pants was 
 the reply he seems to be shaking a lot lately said the chaplain well you know these blue boys aren 
 t used to being operational like this said ops a i know he gets at least two hours sleep a 
 night and that s more than i get

 his sytem we wouldn t even have to embalm him i d love to have a look at the inside 
 of his liver and so i continued each month as members of the battalion who seemed to thrive on this 
 type of life actually began to get stronger while i gradually began to feel as if the corpuscles of my 
 body were having their own private war each fighting to go in a different direction at the same time each 
 morning my body racked with aches and pains provided a challenge as to whether i could rise from my bed 
 then one gloomy monday morning as i staggered into my office about 10 a m i was greeted with the 
 most wonderful words your replacement has been named you re going home six weeks early with tears of joy streaming 
 down my face i began to pack those precious mementoes which i had gathered during my stay an empty filfar 
 bottle from charlie s bar a raincheck from ellen s bar and a broken un cap badge i could hardly 
 control my excitement as i waited early one monday morning for my brethren of the air to take me away

 duties long before the main body left their first responsibility was to support the rotation at a time when personnel 
 were still on leave after working with the summer student employment program and the militia it was not easy to 
 gather the necessary people however the rotation went smoothly and the battalion was off to the island of love work 
 point barracks was left in the hands of major kent foster and capt dave lewis it was really the first 
 part of nov before the rear party started to work as a team and a quick peek into the future 
 told us that we were going to be fairly busy with all ranks having to wear several different hats in 
 order to get the job done our first outside commitment was supplying umpires to the first battalion for exercise pool 
 shark i and 11 all ranks had a good time judging from the reports of the reliable old part 111 
 orders following this things settled down to a fairly good routine until the night of the 28 oct 70 when 
 forty personnel from c coy were called out to the aid of the civil power ammunition was distributed and all 
 ranks were briefed as fully as security regulations allowed and the information known by the commanders at company level was 
 passed on to the troops the troops spent the next few hours being familiarized with drills that would be involved 
 in the event that they were called to do battle with fellow canadians but fortunately these drills were never put 
 to use and the troops were stood down the following morning for which everyone was very happy 
 97 bgen cja hamilton mbe cd commander 1 cbt gp accompanied by capt sj petzing inspects members of the rear 
 party 3 ppcli was approached by canmarpac to conduct an instructors course for internal security early in november 1970 a 
 number of ships personnel who are to form the cadre for future is courses were to be instructed in the 
 basic fundamentals of peace keeping the tense political situation in eastern canada and the involvement of the military lent some 
 urgency to this particular course an insight into the sea element s needs was obtained to assist is parties of 
 two destroyer escorts in their workups a course package of 10 training days specifically modified to suit the difference in 
 training priorities was prepared and submitted for approval the course programme consisted of approximately 60 periods of instruction and two 
 field exercises the instructors were all members of c coy who had various degrees of experience 0:ex 0:perience in peace 
 keeping drills in addition they performed added research 0:re 0:search to deal with the lack of current canadian reference material 
 and adjust the training to canadian conditions the sailors arrived monday 2 nov 70 and to ensure uniformity of dress 
 they were issued with combat clothing this was viewed with some misgivings especially when it was explained that the liner 
 and jacket were good protection against thrown objects the sailors adjusted very quickly to our pace and especially during the 
 two field exercises showed lots of enthusiasm the popularity of the field exercises justified the long hours of preparation outstanding 
 features of the last exercise were a visit by vlp s general k e walsh and mayor r kirby to 
 the training area their escorts i am sure look forward to less demanding big shots in the future

 s of terrorists j taylor e widenmaier and r kretchmar reporter abromeit was firmly but politely told what to do 
 with his notebook so this newsworthy event did not make the headlines the candidates who in some instances had started 
 the course with some misgivings unanimously expressed al the end of the training program that it was a must for 
 every sailor in mid november the experts from 1 cbt gp arrived for the staff inspection the only black mark 
 received was that without a padre on stall it rained the whole time the team was here on 15 dec 
 70 the rear party beat all corners of the barracks to get everyone on the parade square for the commander 
 s inspection clerks of uas and qm staff were all there aided by the canadian forces naden band and under 
 threatening skies the commander inspected and was pleased with the turnout following the parade he spoke to all ranks in 
 the mens mess and later attended a luncheon in the combined officers servants mess the children s christmas party was 
 held on 12 december commencing the long series of holiday festivities the men s christmas dinner was served on 23 
 december and the usual goings on took place christinas messages were read by the rear party commanding officer major kent 
 foster and cpl kevin walsh passed out the usual christmas presents a good meal was served by the officers and

 the base postal officer to ensure that the mail eventually got through in some cases it took up to three 
 weeks but it got there rear party sports outside of a few road runs a couple of dips in the 
 pool steam baths and right arm bending the rear party did not do too much in the way of sports 
 one group however stands out clearly our curling team although very short of personnel on the ground we did enter 
 a team in the armed forces curling bonspiel which was held at playland curling rink on the 21 dec 70 
 there were forty two rinks entered and our team finished in sixth place with a final score of seven to 
 six that is quite an accomplishment 0:accomplish 0:ment when one considers that the team only had three practices and that 
 sgt bill lockhart was a complete novice the team was skipped by mcpl jack white with cpl gerry greene playing 
 lead the second position was played by sgt bill lockhart and mwo bob shine played third well done fellows another 
 sport that claimed many participants was golf our rear party golfing committee did a bang up job arranging tournaments to 
 keep us busy in our off hours a tournament was held in november and seventeen 
 101 stalwart members showed up then in december a turkey tournament was well attended major kent foster came away with 
 the most prizes after he won the hidden low score the only other sport that was attempted was hockey which 
 really never got off the ground because of shortages of personnel but we did manage a few good games between 
 ourselves when the new year starts most of the senior nco s will be getting into shape to meet the 
 incoming pay level 3 platoons all instructors will take a three week refresher course the majority of the rear party

 103 regimental band at the beginning of 1970 the band strength was comprised of 1 capt 2 cwo s 1 
 mwo 9 wo s 42 sgts 9 cpls 4 ptes for a total of 68 due to the inevitable postings 
 and releases and unfortunately the untimely death of sgt pearce j the band was depleted to a total of 62 
 all ranks by the year s end this still leaves us in a fairly healthy position considering that present policy 
 and administration of the musicians trade structure authorizes a total strength of 40 as time passes the strength of the 
 band is expected to decrease to this figure through normal attrition another factor in regards to administration was the transfer 
 of control of the band from mobile command to training command this can create some interesting factors when one considers 
 that training command controls 0:con 0:trols the band whereas a mobile command base cfb calgary administers 0:adminis 0:ters its needs 
 band engagements remained many and varied throughout the year perhaps the highlight if there is a highlight in the band 
 s engagements was a tour of germany during last spring the primary task of the band was to perform at 
 various functions and parades connected with the move of 4 cmbg from nw germany to the area of lahr in 
 the sw there were times during the tour when the band was required to become two and perform in the 
 soest werl hemer area for close out parades and simultaneously in lahr for arrival and change of command parades for 
 those who believe the band lives a comfortable life the foregoing 0:fore 0:going will give an indication that it can 
 at times be a hectic life before returning to canada the majority of the members of the band went to 
 cyprus to entertain the un contingent on that island after some unforeseen delays the band landed at nicosia unloaded the 
 aircraft and immediately set out for salamis and its first concert engagement on the completion of the performance we had 
 our first experience 0:experi 0:ence of the excellent hospitality which we were to receive during our stay on the island 
 we were wined and dined in grand style and our hosts of the royal canadian regiment must be commended for 
 their hospitality throughout 0:through 0:out at kyrenia a concert was performed in the picturesque setting of a small craft harbour 
 and the blue mediterranean a changing of the guard ceremony 0:cere 0:mony between the finnish forces and the irish contingent 
 was the next performance this was held at the un headquarters in nicosia on this occasion the temperature reached 120 
 f not unusual for cyprus during another concert in nicosia the band performed on the green line between the greek 
 and turkish factions fortunately the engagement 0:en 0:gagement was in the evening where the temperature dropped to 90 f but 
 with weapons from both sides turned towards us it felt much warmer during our stay on cyprus many members had 
 the opportunity to tour some of the historical sites for which this island is renowned the world over others preferred 
 the more popular rendezvous for example ellen s bar and restaurant over the past years the local schools have been 
 the scenes of many band concerts and 1970 was no exception during the year 39 concerts were performed in elementary 
 junior and senior high schools the audiences at these concerts totalled approximately 15 000 students 
 104 on the 12th of july 1970 the ppcli band performed for the local inhabitants in kyrenia cyprus they are 
 shown here under the baton of capt j dowel i cd lram arcm director

 variety to its experiences the opening of the alberta legislature the sir winston churchill society s dinner in both calgary 
 and edmonton first battalion patricias service battalion and lord strathcona s horse regimental mess dinners are but a few examples 
 ceremonial parades are also a large part of a band s work load the freedom of the city parades with 
 the first battalion and the lord strathcona s 0:strath 0:cona 0:s horse the annual inspections of the various units in 
 base calgary to name a few of the less formal nature are the annual regimental birthday 0:birth 0:day parades and 
 related functions held by the home station some parades or performances that were unusual or firsts for the band included 
 the presentation of a guidon to the saskatchewan dragoons by his excellency the governor general of canada roland michener held 
 in moose jaw the opening of the sarcee indian reserve all indian rodeo was a first in co operation with 
 other organizations in the city of calgary the jaycees annual christmas concert our dance musicians have shown their versatility again 
 and again during 0:dur 0:ing the last year on some occasions there were two dance bands performing on the same 
 evening the large 15 piece band did not perform too frequently during the year but smaller groups certainly had a 
 busy schedule we are presently attempting to recruit another pianist for our dance bands the dance band was also invited 
 to perform at dances and various celebrations in yellowknife inuvik and cold lake yellowknife and cold lake seem to be 
 extremely popular with this band an interesting duty for our drum major were his trips to 29 palms california and 
 colorado springs colorado the us marine corps and the us air force requested our drum major to train their drum 
 majors in the ppcli method of ceremonial marching and mace drill at present the us army is mulling over this

 107 canadian airborne regiment a full story of the activities of the large group of patricias serving with the airborne 
 regiment is a nearly impossible task to tackle in the limited space available in the patrician each unit within the 
 regiment has had a full and varied programme during the past year and there are patricias serving in almost every 
 unit i will however mention activities of individuals 0:individ 0:uals in an attempt to give some idea of the overall 
 picture the largest group of patricias is of course serving with 2 commando the english speaking infantry component of the 
 regiment there is about to be a large increase in the number of patricias in 2 commando following the return 
 to militia status of three of the other regiments in fact it is already evident from the rush to rebadge 
 to the ppcli that many will have to be turned away 2 cdo is full of old patricias officers ncos 
 and troopers captain merv mcmurray the adjutant of 2 cdo is about to leave the unit for the combat arms 
 school in gagetown several others are also posted out this summer upon completion of their tour of two or three 
 years with the airborne lt dan krystia is off to victoria to join the 3rd battalion in the company of 
 lt jay lapeyre and wo fred harris amongst others lt lepeyre as has probably been noted elsewhere has just been 
 received into the order of st john of jerusalem for saving the life of a turk on a beach in 
 cyprus while serving there with the ist battalion in 1968 he claims that since this is where he spent most 
 of his time it was bound to happen sooner or later among the new arrivals in 2 cdo are lts 
 harry kranenberg and bob tetz both up from the ist battalion in calgary mwo g v rogers was posted in 
 recently from the airborne school or whatever it s called this week as if to prove that he had not 
 forgotten about soldiering during his stint there he went off and acquired an a grading on the infantry pay level 
 7 course in gagetown not all the recent patricia arrivals have fared so well cpl p a mchay arrived from 
 camp borden and found himself promoted a few days later however sgt mchay received a rather nasty introduction to airborne 
 0:air 0:borne operations he broke his leg on the regimental drop into alaska on exercise acid test 111 near fort

 of a platoon and section commander s life in the patricias have been replaced by professional free fallers in the 
 airborne regiment cpl c t shaw an old civilian ski diver has been taken on strength of the new canadian 
 forces free fall team unlike hockey free falling is a year round activity so 2 cdo will probably not be 
 seeing much of cpl shaw finally the ppclt influence in 2 cdo is about to achieve dominance 0:domin 0:ance major

 him the traditions of the patricia airborne

 here is sergeant art sutton leading his section off the drop zone to a company rendevous near fort greely alaska 
 
 109 the headquarters of the regiment also possesses a strong patricia contingent aside from the regimental sergeant major the rsm 
 cwo dick buxton is perhaps the best known and feared patricia in the regiment mr buxton who has ramrodded the 
 airborne since its formation in 1968 continues 0:con 0:tinues to dominate the sergeants mess after much agitation on his part

 and white shoulder flashes csm les gooch white the original other rank of 1 airborne service company is returning to 
 the ist battalion this summer sergeant major white joined the airborne regiment in the summer of 1968 at its very 
 inception and his absence will certainly leave a gap the link between the ppcli and the airborne regiment was further 
 strengthened this past year with the announcement of the appointment of maj gen s c waters cd as colonel of 
 the regiment it is certainly an honour to have a patricia appointed as the first colonel of the airborne regiment 
 and the appointment of gen waters was welcomed by all members 0:mem 0:bers of the airborne patricias and non patricias 
 alike perhaps the biggest purely patricia event in the regiment this past year was the dining in held in the 
 airborne officers mess at griesbach to celebrate the birthday of the colonel in chief we were particularly pleased to receive 
 out of city guests including capt mrs d i t roe from wainwright 0:wain 0:wright and capt mrs vern cole 
 vern continues to be most helpful to us from the home station it is hoped that celebrations for all ranks 
 of the regiment can be organized next march 17th the year 1970 71 has been a particularly busy one for 
 the airborne regiment and the many patricias who serve in it all airborne ranks of the ppcli wish the best

 dinner having been delayed by a previous engagement the cause of their delay provided an interesting vignette the iwo canadian 
 lieutenant colonels had been invited to go along on a military attaches visit to the ii corps area including pliiku 
 ban mf thuot and nha trang because of the size of the group and the time and space factor the 
 party was flown to and from saigon and the up country locations on the return trip as their aircraft a 
 ci 19 was making altitude its port engine caught fire causing a certain amount of consternation amongst crew and passengers 
 the effect was all the more spectacular since it was after dark the pilot skillfully did all the right things 
 and then brought the aircraft safely back clown lo the airfield on the way back to niia trang the various 
 ground soldiers accepted 0:accept 0:ed the manoeuver of the crew and did not really worry but wondered al the while

 he found remarkable in this case he noted that we had started out drinking canadian rye then sat down to 
 a vietnamese 0:vietnam 0:ese dinner including nuoc mam the controversial vietnamese sauce with dinner we drank german wine after dinner 
 we drank scotch whiskey liqueurs american coffee and smoked canadian cigarettes colonel kirn noted that our repast was as international 
 as had been the assistance provided to their country at the time of the korean war this of course led 
 to a toast acknowledging the 2nd bn ppclts efforts in korea by colonel kirn this toast was answered by the 
 author in recognizing the contribution of the republic of korea and the 6th rok div in particular 0:par 0:ticular in

 and capt e m canfield ppcli the canadians arrived at 1930 hrs and were escorted to the upper lounge of 
 the korean villa to a well appointed bar well equipped with air conditioners the latter is a most noteworthy point 
 in a climate where the overnight low temperature is 80 with a generous humidity factor with drinks in hand the 
 canadian group were shown through the attached lounge which was generously appointed with korean paintings an extensive plaque collection from 
 many friendly units and organizations a beautiful sea shell collection which was a small representation of the very extensive collection 
 which is a hobby of the commanding general lgen lee plus numerous objects dart the dinner was a korean tour 
 de force and a gourmets delight starting with a coconut soup served in the coconut a copy of the menu 
 is attached and the items on it were thoroughly enjoyed by all including the well known korean dish of kimchee 
 the canadians learned two korean toasts the first of which would fit in well at any canadian mess dinner particularly 
 among the voracious and thirsty subalterns it is sim chai lai or to the next course which is drunk by 
 all as one course is completed and the next arrives needless to say it was well used at this dinner 
 the second toast in the writer s opinion could well be adopted as the traditional toast at the annual kapyong 
 dinner it was proposed by col john and went as follows yo wangrul wi hayo translated this means for our 
 queen ruler following dinner the party moved into the lounge for tea korean and liqueurs international the balance of the 
 evening was spent in soldierly conversation which covered the full range of topics common to soldiers of any army anywhere 
 the canadians took their leave at approximately 2315 after a most pleasant evening of food drink and comradeship the writer 
 was charged in his capacity as villa manager by bgen wootton to ensure the villa 2 cook got over to 
 the korean villa to learn how to make the coconut soup it had been a real hit with everyone that 
 as you can imagine will provide an interesting challenge in the near future for both manager and cook we all 
 hope and expect to see more of the koreans in the future this concluded the occasion of the 19th anniversary 
 dinner as celebrated 0:cele 0:brated by two patricia officers and friends in a corner of the world far removed from 
 the 2nd bn but as can be imagined the thoughts of all concerned 0:con 0:cerned were with the battalion on 
 the other side of the world on thu 7 may 70 several canadian officers were invited to cocktails and dinner 
 at the korean general officers recreation centre in saigon this was a return engagement following the kapyong dinner given by 
 the canadian 0:can 0:adian officers on 24 apr 70 
 121 the royal green jackets at the beginning of the year the ist battalion commanded by lieut colonel roly guy 
 mbe was stationed at tidworth and recovering from a tour of duty in northern ireland where they had been involved 
 in much of the street disturbances and rioting which had been taking place in that unhappy land it says much 
 for their tact and good nature that they succeeded 0:suc 0:ceeded in being accepted as friends by both sides in 
 the dispute and even succeeded in enlisting several recruits after doing a large number of recruiting demonstrations and making official 
 visits to the cities of oxford and banbury the battalion moved by air to celle in germany where it relieved 
 the 3rd battalion in a direct exchange of stations on arrival in germany they were immediately flung into the now 
 familiar routine of non stop exercises in their role of a mechanized infantry battalion the 2nd battalion under command of 
 lieut colonel david mostyn mbe is now nearing the end of its tour of germany at oxford barracks munster and 
 it has been officially announced that it will be moving to ballykelly 0:bally 0:kelly in northern ireland in the spring 
 of 1971 the battalion still mounted in apc s has continued as one of the infantry battalions of 20 armoured 
 brigade under whose direction it has taken part in numerous exercises once more a highlight of the year has been 
 a most successful three weeks of training in larzac in the south of france the 3rd battalion has undoubtedly had 
 the most eventful year returning 0:re 0:turning to tidworth in may after a most successful farewell parade in celle at 
 which not only were official presentations made to the mayor but also a large number of local citizens were entertained 
 in the barracks it was immediately put on standby for operations in northern ireland on 22nd june the battalion moved 
 north to scotland for three weeks platoon and company training hardly had it arrived there when orders were received for 
 an immediate move to northern ireland so after a hasty return to tidworth it found itself in province reserve awaiting 
 the expected demonstrations 0:demon 0:strations resulting from the orange day parade scheduled for the 12th and 13th of july in 
 the event these passed off peacefully and apart from a 
 122 few minor operations aimed against the ira and other dissident factions the battalion returned to tidworth at the end 
 of the week as it reported inevitably we were relieved when nothing happened and after the big build up the 
 orange day marches proved an anti climax unless you happen to be keen on marches and bands on its return 
 the battalion was immediately involved in running the cento rifle meeting at bisley an onerous task which lasted for most 
 of august this was followed by a week of intensive training at scnnybridge in wales which included a battalion exercise 
 which in its turn was followed by an extremely successful open day at tidworth held for the members of the 
 regimental associations of the three former regiments and their families apart from many tactical demonstrations and lavish hospitality in the 
 various messes the day was ended by sounding retreat in the splendid setting of tidworth park which was much appreciated 
 by the two and a half thousand visitors present as soon as this was over the battalion got ready for 
 its unaccompanied tour in cyprus whence it departed on the 19th october and which is expected 0:ex 0:pected to last 
 until april 1971 the latest report from lieut colonel jimmy glover mbe the commanding officer says we seemed to have 
 settled in very quickly the weather is still glorious there is a lot to do but not too much life 
 is fun and we are enjoying ourselves the whole regiment was delighted by the announcement of the new government that 
 the re organization due to take place in 1971 would not result in the disappearance of a complete battalion but 
 only in its reduction 0:re 0:duction to a representative company this will take place in june 1971 and the representative 
 company 3 rgj will be officially formed on ist july there is every hope that if recruiting continues to improve 
 and the financial situation with it the company may be reformed into a full battalion in the not too distant 
 future the rifle depot under command of lieut colonel mike carlcton smith mbe and the 4th v battalion under lieut 
 colonel john cornell continue to flourish the former is bursting at the seams having recently had a considerable influx of

 129 2554 ppcli calgary cadet corps before looking back over the activities of 1970 we would like to take this 
 opportunity to welcome two more cadet corps into the patricia family to no 2483 and 2701 of esquimalt and winnipeg 
 respectively we wish every success and assure them of healthy competition in the years to come although there were no 
 outstanding regimental activities for us to take part in such as the trooping the colour of 1969 we managed to 
 maintain a well rounded training programme throughout 1970 early in the year the corps attempted its first winter exercise with 
 the first battalion supplying arctic equipment and assistants and a good number of cadets in attendance it was proven that 
 young cadets and old instructors have the stamina for cold weather training the fourth annual calgary tri service cadet tattoo 
 was held on the ist of may with the minister of national defence the honourable leo cadieux as the reviewing 
 officer once again the patricia cadet corps was much in evidence supplying a great deal of colour with a flag 
 party drill team and corps of drums dressed in the full dress scarlets of the regiment 0:regi 0:ment the corps 
 of drums was the mainstay of the massed bands with much thanks going to drum major r elliott cd first 
 battalion for his ability to make a cohesive unit out of the corps of drums from the three services we 
 took this opportunity in the form of a public appearance to pay a tribute to the regiment when the corps 
 of drums and the drill team performed a salute to the regiment much hard work labour and rehearsal 0:re 0:hearsal 
 went into another feature of the programme this was the production of two assault landing craft used to perform a 
 simulated beach landing radio communication piped through the speaker system superimposed on appropriate background noises plus the use of blank 
 ammunition provided a great deal of realism to the performance the 6th of june was the occasion of a combined 
 annual inspection with all the calgary army cadet corps forming a massed ceremonial parade the reviewing officer was major general 
 w a howard cd senior militia advisor to the minister of national defence the day was hot and clear and 
 the sun took its toll with many a cadet recovering on the sidelines our corps of drums was the duty 
 band for the inspection and were also affected by the heat however those who could rejoined the drums in sufficient 
 time to perform the regimental march for the patricia corps to march past general howard following the parade the cadets 
 were supplied a lunch of hamburgers hot dogs and beans thanks to much hard work on the part of 1 
 ppcli wives club with the afternoon taken up by sports a memorable day came to an end for five cadet 
 corps the 1970 annual inspection saw the corps place fourth and only 4 7 points behind the first place fort 
 garry horse cadet corps this was a disappointment after having placed first in the province of alberta the previous year 
 however the corps of drums continued their achievements and placed first in the province for the fourth successive year 
 130 cadet corporal g henson as he took part during the ceremonies at heritage park calgary on the 12th of

 131 at this point we would like to take the opportunity to give public thanks to drum major r elliott 
 and his men of the first battalion corps of drums they have worked untiringly giving of their time and knowledge 
 to the benefit of this cadet corps and its young musicians due to the combined parade held on the 6th 
 of june there were no presentations made on the annual inspection to compensate for this a presentation parade was held 
 on saturday the 27th of june at which time major g d hunt cd first battalion was the reviewing officer

 he thereby earned for himself a trip to the carribean and for the corps the distinction of having had the 
 top master cadet in alberta for five successive years cadet sergeant laird s robertson s experiences whilst on the exchange 
 trip to the west indies are recorded elsewhere in this journal the 1970 71 training year commenced with the first 
 parade held on the sth of september enthusiasm and activity commenced immediately and is continuing to abound the first outside 
 activity took place when the corps moved out to the bow river forest reserve for a week end of living 
 on the ground first cadets progressed through a series of night patrols although we were year cadets concentrated on elementary 
 fieldcraft while the more senior hampered by unseasonably cold weather the cadets mastered the art of sleeping warmly in improvised 
 lean to s on the 12th of october the corps simulated the departure of a military body of troops from 
 calgary s famous heritage park in so doing they lent some authenticity to the closing of the park for another 
 winter with a quarter guard the corps of drums and a flag party piquets and sentries were mounted and paced 
 their beat the piquets were relieved the quarter guard dismounted the drums beat retreat and the troops entrained in the

 139 jamaican cadet visit 1970 cadht major ls robhrtson calgary slrvicr bat i allion cadet corps formerly cdt sgt 2554 
 ppcli cadet corps at the completion of the master cadet examinations held in april 1970 at edmonton i was honoured 
 to receive word that i had been selected to participate in the west indies exchange anil was destined for jamaica 
 before this narrative begins a brief resume of jamaican history is required in order to set the scene the name 
 jamaica comes from an arawak indian word meaning land of wood and water extensive bauxite mining operations are carried out 
 in several parts of the island and jamaica is the largest single exporter of bauxite in the world large sugar 
 cane estates are located on the lowlands 0:low 0:lands throughout the island bananas are grown and shipped mainly to the 
 united kingdom the island also harvests coffee mangoes breadfruit and plantain spiky bamboos and the majestic mahogany the island of 
 jamaica is shrouded in white blooms of legnum vitae and scarlet poincinna columbus first discovered the island in 1494 and 
 colonized it in 1509 the british wrested the island from the spaniards in 1655 colonization was slow for the remainder 
 of the seventeenth century but trade was brisk as the pirate henry morgan moved his base from torluga to port 
 royal jamaica the town of port royal was destroyed by an earthquake in 1692 and disappeared into the sea kingston 
 the capital since ik7o has one of the world s best harbours fifteen miles west of kingston is spanish town 
 the original capital of jamaica which was founded by diego columbus and known as villa de la vega upon defeating 
 the spanish in 1655 the british government look over the capital hence the name spanish town monlego bay on the 
 north coast is one of the most famous resorts in the caribbean excellent resort facilities extend across the north coast 
 from monlego bay lo port antonio one such spot is the jamaica playboy club hotel the alberta contingent of the 
 west indies exchange programme departed 0:de 0:parted from edmonton by service aircraft on the eighth of july for ottawa and 
 then on lo amp pctawawa by bus pelawawa as in the past was chosen as our home for two weeks 
 prior lo departure ll has been selected chiefly for its climatic similarities to the tropics but unfortunately the weatherman made 
 an error which resulted in cool temperatures anil rain after extensive training in the subjects that we would be instructing 
 our west indian counterparts we moved to ottawa for departure on a canadian forces boeing 707 aircraft the trip by 
 air was a good one however on our arrival at palisades airport kingston the temperature change affected most of us 
 immediately the heal contrasting 0:contrast 0:ing greatly from ontario s cool climate the jamaicans greeted us at the airport with 
 a sharp anil well turned out honour guard but after the long flight we canadians were unable to convey as 
 good an impression as our hosts 
 140 the first few days entailed the usual paper work and acclimatization for the canadian cadets during this period our 
 home consisted of a few tents at the end of the airstrip in up park camp along with cadets from 
 trinidad and tobago barbados grenada guyana and antigua plus a few jamaicans our next stop was port antonio where we 
 spent a week of fun in the sun our residence was a converted british army barracks now known as titchfield 
 school prior to being utilized as a barracks the site had been occupied by an old fort the walls of 
 which still surround the school with the ancient cannon pointing out to sea from port antonio buses transported us to 
 the various beaches along the northern coast where a leisurely life was enjoyed by all our return trip to kingston 
 provided us with an interesting experience as we travelled by second class train stops were frequent because the train halts 
 for anyone who flags it down this trip was on a friday market day and the stops were numerous it 
 appeared that every peasant from miles around was travelling with his produce to the capital thus the few compartments were 
 soon filled and the sight of the jamaicans riding on the sides and roofs of the coaches was indeed a 
 new one to we canadians back in kingston it was a relief to hear that the tent camp had been 
 washed out by very heavy rains and that our accommodation had been changed to a regular force barracks during that 
 weekend we participated in street dances and parties which celebrated the anniversary of the island s independence from britain camp 
 moneague in the foreground is the qm stories the seven flags of the participating countries are situated in front of 
 the orderly room 
 141 a typical scene jamaican peasant burro his home and a pile of coconut husks after three days of gaiety 
 we were moved to moneague to instruct the west indian cadets in first aid and rescue techniques moneague is a 
 small town deep within the interior of jamaica which consists of two bars and police station the cadet tent camp 
 was situated about a quarter of a mile from the town during the time we were stationed here our sole 
 means of transportation was an ancient broken down cattle truck which took us on our first trip to the ewarton 
 works of the alcan jamaica ltd where bauxite is processed here we toured the mining sites and the plant at 
 the conclusion of which we were invited to swim in the executive club pool and have refreshments courtesy of the 
 company a number of trips were made to dunns river falls which always provided a relief for the cadets from 
 the dust and heat of the tented camp here one could partake of a swim in fresh or salt water 
 or one could just sit and relax while observing the extraordinary number of beautiful girls disposed along the beach a 
 complete day was to have been spent in montego bay but for the majority of us forty five minutes only 
 was the length of our stay in the jet spot of the carribbean this was due to a three hour 
 delay on the morning of departure which is typical and then we suffered a continual series of delays enroute as 
 our army truck had a cracked radiator despite 0:des 0:pite all this our short stay was conducted in style as 
 we were hosted at a closed club on the hotel strip utilizing their dining and swimming 
 142 facilities the strip consists of approximately eight miles of highly rated clubs and hotels which are strategically situated to 
 over look the sea in order to provide their customers with beautiful beaches of white sand and surf at the 
 conclusion of the moneague episode we returned to kingston for tours and last minute souvenir hunting prior to our return 
 to canada we departed from kingston jamaica on the seventeenth of august by service aircraft destination ottawa our sojourn in 
 the caribbean was over one day was spent in petawawa for the necessary clearance medicals and many other little things 
 that were required prior to our dispersal the alberta contingent returned to edmonton by air canada and scattered to their

 143 1 ppcli wives 7 club the 1 ppcli wives club began 1970 under the leadership of a new president 
 mrs margaret green mrs green brought much enthusiasm and energy to her position and it was under her guidance that 
 the club initiated a new project the 1 ppcli wives club annual bursaries under the terms of the bursaries two 
 scholarships of 150 each one for a male and one for a female are offered annually to dependent children of 
 serving members of 1 ppcli including attached services personnel and all those who have served with 1 ppcli since 1950 
 the scholarships enable the recipients to attend a technical or vocational school of their choice and are available to students 
 from grade 10 and up the fund arose from the feeling of many club members that the dependent children of 
 army personnel often suffer hardship in their academic 0:aca 0:demic careers as a result of the constant transfer from school 
 to school when the father is posted these children tend to become discouraged and think of dropping out as soon 
 as legally possible by offering scholarships 0:scholar 0:ships from grade 10 on it was felt that students with career potential 
 but no university orientation might be encouraged to continue on into a trade while initiating the new project club members 
 continued with established 0:estab 0:lished interests the okon room committee visited the colonel belcher hospital twice monthly to staff the 
 tea room for veterans and soldiers the hospital visiting committee made weekly calls to cheer bedridden patricias and dependents and 
 the film committee presented low cost movies for camp children this was discontinued in may of 1970 due to a 
 rise in the cost of renting films in addition to the long term projects club members embarked upon a series 
 of short term money raising projects to build up the scholarship fund we raffled a portable tv in june and 
 a christmas hamper in december 0:dec 0:ember we had a rummage sale in the spring and another in the fall 
 and in june we had an unforgettable experience serving hot dogs and hamburgers after the combined calgary district cadet corps 
 parade in october we had the honour to be asked to pour tea at the all ranks reception for mrs 
 a hamilton gault and we took the occasion to present mrs gault with an engraved silver spoon as a memento 
 of the 1 ppcli wives club 1970 was a good year for us there was much hard work but there 
 was a lot of fun too for who could forget our wig fitting session the potluck supper and those gorgeous 
 chinese dinners to all who helped make it a wonderful year thank you and we look forward to seeing new

 a bit disappointed that we had only been in on the tail end of the operation and had not seen 
 any real activity on the 6 november robert lortie one of the kidnappers of mr pierre laporte had been captured

 and active is a branch ladies auxiliary our ladies have always accompanied us to our meetings but in the past 
 have been on their own while the members held their meetings now the ladies are formed into committees and hold 
 a meeting concurrently with ours with the ladies assuming the responsibility of flowers visits etc to members wives who may 
 be ill they now have a greater feeling of belonging to the branch the calgary branch regrets to report the 
 passing of a fine patricia in the person of glen laird who died of a heart attack on the bth 
 of october 1970 edmonton branch the executive of the edmonton branch is elected to serve a term of two years 
 and the end of 1970 was the completion of the term for the executive listed below president joe dunn vice 
 president chick oakley secretary treasurer muzz kozak past president murray church members neil neufeld mickey yost needless to say that 
 as the year drew to a close there was a flurry of paper work and effort to finalize all the 
 branch business in order that the incoming executive would inherit a minimum of back log the old executive will turn 
 over a projected format and recommendations which will serve as a guide for future progress we are anxiously awaiting the 
 arrival of a branch flag which has been ordered through the regimental adjutant it is our intention to adopt a 
 procedure of consequence for the flag which will be relative to our activities 0:activit 0:ies this matter has generated much 
 discussion and enthusiasm among the members which is most encouraging there has been an increase in the number of regular 
 members but a decrease in serving members due to postings etc which has left our membership on a par with 
 the previous year the executive has discussed and will implement a system whereby the city of edmonton will be divided 
 into sections with a chairman appointed for each section the responsibility of each chairman will be to form a working 
 team within his area of responsibility and rout out all the casualties this method of personal contact should locate many 
 old comrades attendance at meetings continues to be good and all branch socials have been well attended on the 17th 
 of march 1970 the members gathered in the upper lounge of the montgomery branch of the royal canadian legion to 
 celebrate 0:cele 0:brate the birthday of our colonel in chief it was agreed by all that the evening was far 
 toa short and there were many tales left to be told next year dune mcdonell and harry anderson were hilarious 
 in their descriptive 0:des 0:criptive anecdotes of their years with the patricias in fort osborne barracks prior to world war 
 2 it is rumoured that early risers as far away as portage avenue did their ablutions to the tune of 
 has anyone seen the colonel etc 
 171 thursday the 7th of may was the occasion for the annual frezenberg banquet and dance held this year at 
 the norwood branch of the royal canadian legion allen yablonski formerly first battalion at present the president of the norwood 
 branch successfully made a special effort to make all patricias and their guests feel at home ed rohac and his 
 supreme courts supplied excellent music for listening and dancing the next event was the annual battle of frezenberg parade to 
 edmonton s 0:edmon 0:ton 0:s cenotaph escorted by a platoon of troops from the loyal edmonton regiment 4ppcli president joe 
 dunn led the parade along jasper avenue to the cenotaph where a service was held and a wreath laid in 
 memory of our fallen comrades lieutenant colonel w h ross commanding 0:com 0:manding officer ler 4ppcli took the salute at 
 the march past following the service both cfrn tv and cbc tv were on hand to record this occasion and 
 the films were viewed on the evening news the loyal edmonton regiment s band was on parade on this occasion 
 and were duly thanked for doing their homework in mastering some of the patricia s traditional marching tunes these were 
 noticeable by their absence in the 1969 parade for the record muzz kozak denies shouting get a haircut and keep 
 canada clean at a group of long haired individuals at the cenotaph the edmonton branch has applied for and been 
 granted permission to march as a unit in the annual remembrance day parade to be held by the royal canadian 
 legion we have been allotted position number 7 in the order of march and the branch flag will take its 
 place in the colour party the executive of the past two years is satisfied that the goals set for itself 
 and the branch have been met with a new executive standing in the wings we anticipate new ideas continued enthusiasm 
 and steady growth saskatchewan branch the saskatchewan branch held its annual reunion on the 3rd of october 1970 at the 
 vagabond inn regina his worship mayor baker presented a memento to the branch on behalf of the city of regina 
 it was accepted on behalf of the members by lieutenant colonel p o stayner cd dr stephen worobetz mc lieutenant 
 governor of the province of saskatchewan and a former medical officer with the regiment during the italian campaign of world 
 war 2 presented honourary life memberships on behalf of the association the recipients were s waterman w lawson w raeside 
 dr c morphy h drope h coops and c schmitt cecil schmitt in his reply to the toast to the 
 regiment reminded the members that the patricias not only had a distinguished record of service during both world wars but 
 brought a great deal of credit to canada when its members were called upon to guard and give stability to 
 many troubled spots in the world he also noted a remarkable feeling of comradeship and bonds of friendship much in 
 evidence to day

 of the 23rd annual general meeting on the 12th of september all who attended from piper j m robertson down 
 to the younger soldiers of the second battalion who joined us for the dance appeared to thoroughly enjoy themselves it 
 was believed that this reunion week end would be the occasion for the setting up of a wager by elements 
 of the edmonton branch perhaps joe dunn and muzz kozak feared the stakes were too high with a branch membership 
 of 185 ordinary and 4 honourary life members we are still waiting for the braggarts from alberta s oil city 
 steve burdeiny continues to perform trojan efforts in the line of welfare and maintains close liaison with our ladies auxiliary

 w saniuk a e young the toronto branch report is in the form of a report of the annual meeting 
 which was held on the 19th of march 1971 the meeting was held in the fort york armouries and attendance 
 was drastically curtailed by a five inch snowfall which resulted in only eleven members being able to navigate the streets 
 and arrive safely of great interest to the members is the probability of holding future executive meetings quarterly in the 
 sergeants mess the queen s own rifles of canada moss park armouries all members are invited to attend these meetings 
 and it is anticipated that a smoker will be held following each of them the executive for 1971 is as

 l dymond d middleton j c newlands ottawa branch j slimkowich j kirby m a trotter president dick whitmore guided 
 the ottawa branch through another successful year socially harmonious and financially solvent the first significant event in the year was 
 a meeting of the old guard who pledged their continued support to the ottawa branch of the ppcli association they 
 also agreed to organize a committee of the senior members to ensure that none of our comrades would be neglected 
 if he had the misfortune to be ill attendance at funerals of departed comrades was accepted as a responsibility our 
 honorary life members set a very fine example of camaraderie for the rest of us other events which our branch 
 enjoyed were 
 174 17 march social get together with the serving personnel at the forces headquarters mess 8 may the serving officers 
 and their guests dined together thereby commemorating a moment of regimental history 31 may a family picnic at massey park 
 in toronto 14 october our fall banquet this social event was combined with the election of officers 11 november colonel 
 hill and gerry robertson represented the association 0:as 0:sociation at the remembrance ceremonies at the national 0:nation 0:al cenotaph the 
 ottawa branch is pleased to welcome the new members of our association who have joined us following their reassignment from 
 the queen s own rifles of canada we have been socially enriched by this welcome addition we are particularly fortunate 
 in the ottawa branch because the serving members generously shared their mess functions with us on many occasions during the 
 year the new executive for 1971 is as follows honorary president colonel s h hill past president r d whitmore 
 president d lan roe vice president major w k stirling secretary treasurer kerry j dunphy committee members s ennis smith 
 ray parker harold mcnamara arthur steele the officers and members of our branch extend their best wishes to all patriciadom 
 montreal branch once again we have had an active year in montreal with plenty of informal meetings between groups of 
 members and individuals our city attracts many visitors and we like to think that we are a closeknit crowd of 
 patricias at the same time we don t have any formal branch meetings because of the size of montreal and 
 the difficulty in getting about be that as it may there was a very enjoyable dinner in may last year 
 at the mcgill faculty club to honour frezenberg day with its double significance for both veterans of world war 1 
 and world war 2 unfortunately 0:unfortun 0:ately with the passing of clarence picher and tom stewart both over a year 
 ago we have no originals in the montreal area however at this dinner we were joined by reg jones then 
 of saint john and now of cornwall 0:corn 0:wall ontario and major david corrigall one of the older patricias who 
 is now a resident of ste anne s veterans hospital and whose son young dave was one of the first 
 reinforcement officers from mcgill to join the regiment in world war 11 we are always fortunate in having visits from 
 mrs hamilton gault who at least once a year flies in from england to stay at her beloved st hilaire 
 so long associated with the warm hospitality offered by her and hammie she was there in september and october and 
 is expected back in may of this year 
 175 in november thanks to the organizing enthusiasm of hal godber a group of montreal members occupied a special ppcli 
 table at the remembrance day luncheon of the canadian club in december we had the pleasure of an extended visit 
 from captain vern cole who was a student at the canadian armed forces school of management in montreal vern had 
 a very full programme of studies but about twenty of us managed to foregather one sunday afternoon and convey personally 
 our appreciation of his devoted service to the association and the regiment finally on march 17th we had a cocktail 
 party and reception again at the mcgill faculty club which was honoured by the presence of the colonel of the 
 regiment and mrs ware sixty members and their ladies were on hand they included a long lost comrade a c 
 archie mac kinnon who has been living all this time in massachusetts and who on this occasion paid what is 
 believed to have been his first visit to montreal in fifty years he has joined the montreal branch and also 
 remains very active in royal canadian legion affairs in the u s we have always enjoyed and appreciated our association 
 with active patricias who are stationed at st hubert some of them are listed with our own montreal members but 
 it is difficult to keep up with their frequent postings and general moving about we are also very proud of 
 the fact that jimmy delalanne has returned to the post of president of the general committee of the association many 
 would like if possible to attend the next annual meeting which is to be held in november in victoria rowan 
 coleman and frank henstridge remain in office in the montreal branch but both have expressed a wish to retire so 
 you can expect soon to hear about a new executive we announce with deep regret the passing of w b 
 bill allan in montreal in november united kingdom branch christmas 1970 was a white christmas in england and heralded the 
 closing of another year and we look forward to the new year and to the future whatever it may bring 
 the year 1970 was once more a quiet year for the united kingdom branch with but one gathering at the 
 victory club in london this was on the bth of may to celebrate the fifty fifth anniversary of the battle 
 of frezenberg and to conduct our annual general meeting the meeting has traditionally been followed by a luncheon and this 
 one was no exception twelve members several with their wives sat down to our annual reunion lunch we were pleased 
 to have in our midst on this occasion the widow of a former commanding officer lieutenant colonel a g pearson 
 mc dcm with her was her son mr lan pearson we could not help but be envious of some of 
 our absent members who were able to travel to germany and join the second battalion theirs was the pleasure of 
 seeing the regiment perform its farewell trooping at 
 176 fort mcleod and related ceremonies in the ypres salient many more of us wished we could be with the 
 troops but we are not as fit for travelling 0:travel 0:ling as we were over half a century ago of 
 prime interest on the agenda of the meeting was the resolution stating that all patricias that had been on strength 
 of the regiment prior to the bth of may 1915 were to be accepted as honorary life members we have 
 subsequently learned as is reported elsewhere in this journal that honorary life membership has been extended to all patricias who 
 were on strength of the regiment on or before the 19th of march 1919 we regret to report the passing 
 last june 2nd of 875 h f paddy o connell paddy was renowned not only for his service with the 
 patricias but as a member of the original north west mounted police prior to the first world war and finally 
 as a captain in the home guard during the second world war we surely miss paddy as a member of 
 our branch the united kingdom branch sends greetings and best wishes to all patricias past and present may 1971 be 
 a happy year for all of us 1898 right dress 1971 william scully limited 2090 moreau montreal 402 area code
