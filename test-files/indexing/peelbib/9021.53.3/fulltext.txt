 cardston speaking to the latter point name of one of the great kainai chiefs who rcmp superintendent christian junget had
 signed the 1 877 treaty with the declared that the animosity was due in part canadian government the whole affair
 to the fact that the indians engaged in representing the old days at the 1924 macleod jubilee were came as
 quite a surprise to everyone except agriculture have moved to the southern part these women with their dog a few
 of the tribe and the initiation was of the blood reservation and there being travois at right istakes a man
 enjoyed by the great crowd of people who practically nothing left up around wife of white bull a blood were
 present in the hail a brief meeting standoff is junget suggested further that leader was held following the closing ceremony
 at the indian agent of the blood reservation is in wrong with the people of macleod and that macleod resents
 very much the attitude he takes toward the old town in using his influence in taking everything to card ton
 it is likely that self interest of macleod business leaders was a motivating factor take for instance the statement of
 jack blood who complained about the move of the indian agency from the north end of the blood reserve to
 the cardston area we like to trade in macleod he said but our agent does not give us any orders
 here they are all on another town we don t live in that macleod citizens may have been goadrng native
 people to organize became a contentious point that deflected attention r away from the real problems neveitheless mountain horse and
 grady alone had a berta history i summer 2005 mobilized native leaders to meet all of led m christianson inspector
 for indian whom chose freely to participate thus agencies at regina to write graham that this reflecting their concerns regarding
 the was the first he had heard of long lance s government s illicit leasing practices participation irrespective of the
 organizers motivations his lack of concern is surprising considering the official indian affairs position read as the self proclaimed indian
 leader attended follows native agitators were responsible the previous july s macleod jubilee along for stirring up dissent which in
 turn led to the with 2 500 siksika pikuni and kainai and ill advised gathering indian commissioner 15 000 tourists
 celebrating the town s bi w m graham immediately wrote scott centennial 23 perhaps christianson was upon learning of the
 meeting to express his aware that long lance a part black part regret he was convinced that non native cherokee
 newspaperman had long agitators had a hand in goading the overstayed his welcome among the kainai blackfoot to convene and
 that this ‘ in all and quietly fled by summer s end making it probability means the start of a
 very serious unlikely that he could have been the situation warning that steps were required convention s key organizer ‘
 to stop this outside interference this line of reasoning suggests that native leaders led by scott indian affairs aggressively were
 passive reactionaries incapable of resisted the proposed july convention political agency and that outside actors although this failed to deter
 conference provoked them to take political action ‘ when organizers in fact that january mountain no grievances exist 2 graham
 was clearly horse wrote to scott seeking his support for unaware or simply failed to accept the acuity the upcoming
 summer convention of his charges as did minister of the interior something he anticipated as being an all stewart who
 cautioned grady that native round indian affair mountain horse was people could be deceiving suggesting that aware of scotes influence

 convention would graham s assertions that outside influences prove more difficult were at the bottom of the whole affair were
 a few of the board of trade of macleod who both men understood that this time if they are still
 sore over the moving of the agency failed to get scott s and stewart s support the from the north
 end to its present location convention would not be unsuccessful they alleging that media claims of convention also knew that

 several years as interpreter and scout 34 in good health and are happy we have money to buy food and
 clothing and our while not as optimistic and still of the agent is the best we ever had 28 opinion
 that the good people of macleod are really providing the motive power both the kainai chief during this period had

 travelled fast and this little incident grew into a boom for in moving by a townsite was laid out and
 lots offered for sale i was tipped off by a company agent who george h gooderham was bringing land seekers
 from the united jstates with this inside information i took the n 1910 everybody in southern alberta first train to
 caristadi i remember it well a was either a real estate agent or a client fine hot day in june
 i was a little of both my travelling companion was the sergeant new towns and new subdivisions to young of
 the rcmp detachment at gleichen my towns sprang up overnight carlstadt was a home town this was an unexpected good
 example it was a spot on the cpr pleasure hut i concluded that he must be on about 35 miles
 west of medicine hat at some important assignment br lie was first it was a flag station and called heavily
 armed wearing his red serge and langevin then it became a post office and visibly suffering from strain and the
 heat iiamed carlstadt during the first world war that name was not popular and it was when i told him
 what i was doing he renamed alderson it lays on the bald confided to me that he was also going
 to headed prairie in the short grass belt and carlstadt on orders from edmonton two when one says bald headed
 one could add long term prisoners had broken out of the that the scalp is usually very dry penitentiary arid
 it had been reported that men answering their description were part of nevertheless sod busters had invaded this a crew
 erecting farm buildings about five area and following them came the miles south of that place i was even allowed
 merchants to make a town till 1910 nothing to read the report which gave their criminal had happened at carlstadt
 and only then did records and descriptions they were tough the railway land department waken up to the hombres i
 noted that one had been maimed fact that the company buildings had been in a gun battle and now walked
 with a limp erected not on cpr land but on the school section the solution was simple just move the
 sergeant was an old timer and i was only across the tracks twenty one and a bit of a tenderfoot
 at his alberta history summer 2005 suggestion we were to stick together while that a big school was to be
 built on or near in the new town and i would then get good my corner and that i would
 be assured a treatment and lodging which would be at a good profit if i wanted to sell but who
 premium i was to accompany him the next would sell and take a small profit when a day to the
 farm where the buildings were town had the future of carlstadt under construction i rejoined the sergeant who had been
 to the we arrived at carlstadt at 5 30 pm some livery barn and hired a team and buckboard frame
 buildings had been moved in or for the next morning he took me for a walk hastily constructed but as
 yet there was no we entered various buildings and no one hotel the only restaurant was a large tent objected
 in fact everybody treated the and its proprietor was a greek who took on mountie as the lord of the
 manor even to the role of ‘ mine host he supplied rooms touching their hats we went upstairs over stores
 or in shacks and undoubtedly opened doors inspected beds and what not supplied liquor to those who asked for it
 finally my friend said well sleep here the presence of a red coat meant only tonight indicating a room at
 the head of the one thing to him a search for the blind stairs over the pooi room then we
 went pig he and his helpers were so nervous that back to the tent and had tea and toast i
 do jack morton was one of the it was obvious they were guilty of illicit not recollect either of us
 paying for a meal most colourful and capable trafficking the sergeant was quite aware of apparently that was not expected
 ranchers in southern alberta he also took an active role in this and took advantage of the situation to the
 calgary stampede see that our wants were promptly met we after that we decided to turn in my afthough gooderhams
 first were given a place of honour at the common mounted police friend removed his clothes meeting with him was
 supper table waited upon with deference and hung them on the back of the chair next contentious they later became
 and believe it or not two linen table napkins to the bed and placing his belt and revolver friends distinguished
 us from the common herd on the seat said now you take the inside the proprietor s wife served us
 and i am next to the wall remember don t move or sure that she washed and ironed those say
 anything if someone comes in here napkins after our arrival had been broadcast during the night just leave it all
 to me i for they had been ironed while wet which agreed naturally but wondered why he made made it
 next to impossible to open them up those remarks we thoroughly enjoyed the whole performance frankly i wasn t sleepy
 there were no blinds over the windows and the moon shone after supper i located the land office but on
 my face the man in the next room was alas i was a bit late others in the line ahead
 a professional snorer and his head was of me had grabbed up the choice front street separated from ours by
 one inch boards central lots i had to be satisfied with two openly spaced to allow full volume no 25
 foot lots on the corner of front and 4 th doubt and i kept thinking what might ave east that
 was on the outskirts but at happen before morning least the lots were cheaper the pair cost 250 one third
 cash and the balance in two i did doze but came wide awake by the equal instalments in three and
 six months i heavy steps ascending the stairs they didn t dare to leave my place in line before i
 stopped at our door it opened and with light bought but afterwards 1 did take a look over of the
 moon i could see the frame was filled the townsite and inspected my purchase i by a monster of a
 man he halted then said was lucky the lots were on good flat prairie boys who put you in here
 this is my and not in a slough room no answer he asked the question again and followed it with
 a rumbling oath i met a couple of friends who were there as he started forward but he stopped early
 and had purchased lots on front street because my dear bedfellow had reached for at centre avenue of course they
 his revolver nothing was said and the sympathized with me but made me feel intruder slowly retreated and closed the
 much better by saying that it was rumored door i relaxed and soon was asleep alberta history i summer 2005
 we were awakened early by a tap on the coat when it was over i enjoyed the drive door the
 sergeant said ‘ come in and to my back to town surprise it was our host the greek his eyes
 were bulging and he was visibly shaken it was hot and dry the grass was short and when he said
 you fellows nearly got me curly and the sergeant said that was a sign killed big jack morton has this
 room rented that this country was fit only for grazing and all the time and he had to sleep on
 the not good for farming i was inclined to billiard table he blamed me and slapped agree but lie could
 be wrong al these new and shook me please tell him i didn t do it settlers couldn t be
 wrong could they i m scared of him the sergeant promised to speak to him we returned home by the
 afternoon train jack morton was the ‘ captain blood of the old timers said that 1910 was the driest prairies
 he owned a big spread in the hand summer in their experience crops even as hills to the north he
 was a good friend but far west as calgary wilted and passed away a terrible enemy i came to be
 a friend in rumors from carlstadt weren t later years but this was our first meeting pleasant to hear the
 boom had bust by the george h gooderham jack liked a man who did tile unusual and end of august
 i was wondering if i should for that and other reasons he dismissed this or could pay the next installment
 on my incident with a laugh lots then along came my friend the itinerant land salesman he had recruited after
 breakfast we loaded ourselves and buyers from all over the united states and firearms into the buckboard and headed had
 orders to buy on behalf of those who south to the farm where the building gang could not accompany him
 he asked if i still was working the sergeant had the had the lots i said yes ‘ would i
 sell he directions we followed a trail except when asked and before i could reply he added 1 cut off
 by a newly built farm fence bits of can get you 100 niore than you paid if land were broken
 but for the most part it you ll split it with me a new york friend was still open flat
 prairie one could see a wants to buy with great relief i said sold long distance on that bright june
 morning on your terms but i was not enjoying the drive after the sergeant had informed me that the rifle
 the new york man paid out carlstadt which we carried was for me to use if became alderson but that
 didn t make it necessary grow it showed signs of life in wet years but gradually it faded into a
 jerk water finally we could see the house under stop on the cpr line the farmers pulled out construction it
 was well advanced and two and the hotel owner moved his building to men were laying shingles when we got
 gleichen but our new york buyer still paid within 150 yards the sergeant stopped the taxes for years until notices
 were no longer horses handed me the reins and said forwarded to him what are the lots worth don t
 move from there unless i call you today they might make good pasture for sheep he walked to the house
 and started to talk to the men on the roof i breathed heavily and toyed with the rifle thinking all
