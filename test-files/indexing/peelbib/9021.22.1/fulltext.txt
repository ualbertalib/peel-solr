 ged martin from the late 1840 s to the late 1 860 s three main themes could be said to
 constitute the dominant unofficial opinion in britain about the future of the prairies first it was felt that they formed
 a natural link in the territories of british north america and that they would therefore be settled from canada on
 the one side and vancouver island on the other secondly it was widely believed that a railway could be built
 without undue difficulty to link the british colonies on the atlantic and pacific thirdly there was a vague notion that
 the prairies would one day form part of an eventual transcontinental union of british america dr martin was born in
 essexengland and was educated at cambridge university where he received his ba in 1967 and phd in 1972 from 1969
 to 1972 he was a fellow of magdalene college cambridge and in 1972 he became a research fellow in history
 in the institute of advanced studiesaustralian national university canberra he is the author of the durham report and british policy

 missionary society was greeted as the beginning of a vast nation willing to meet the cost the chancellor of which
 in all human probability will stretch the exchequer henry goulburn piously its mighty arms from ocean to ocean and added
 that a bishop might be more useful which shall carry the blessings of english in converting the heathen the proposal
