 driven by an irishman and eventually got into a thicklynamed flynn it was a rattly old con wooded swampy uninhabited
 tract of veyance and the road was full of holes country through which we walked in the and the stage

 we had not and a sister lived there from sussex turned back and were very friendly we were quite comfortable
 in an attic where we each so we toiled on another mile and had a bed i did not feel
 the least tired eventually found the house right down despite my heavy pack but understood by the lake we were
 feeling very dead the true significance of the term tender and to our dismay found the house foot i had
 been wearing an enormous locked up it is a most magnificent pair of boots known as snow packs spacious house
 once used as a store which were not very suitable for long with all kinds of buildings but the distance
 walking and had raised a owner had moved his business and lent blister on my heel which troubled me it
 to us at a nominal rent we opened a lot afterwards after a capital break a window and broke in
 boustead went fast one of the men drove us part of off to another house close by the present the
 way in his waggon he was going store kept by a man called hamlyn an to his homestead to dig
 potatoes and englishman who with his family and he had a fine quantity of vegetables his brother s family on
 the other side of which grow abundantly everywhere the lake form the nucleus of a congrega the country was undulating
 and varied tion they told us that whitaker had with little lakes gone off on the previous saturday on a
 tour of inspection which he had arranged we then started to walk and visited to take before he got the
 letter announcan old english couple who had won ing our arrival and was not expected fourteen prizes for vegetables at
 a local back until the next evening boustead show which they showed us with pride returned with a loaf and
 butter and they had gone out late in life but had some tinned salmon and we made a settled down
 well and with their two meal and rested this was tuesday sons held three homesteads we had evening and whitaker
 did not return till only about eight miles more to walk thursday morning so we had time to but found
 them much more tiring than look around the lake was beautiful all the day before we eventually came especially at
 sunset i have seldom seen to lac la nonne a lake about six miles such wonderful effects it was covered
 long and from one to two miles broad with duck and full of fish so that food beautifully timbered all
 round with was easily procured we did not manlittle undulating hills we passed a age to get much i did
 not shoot but went schoolhouse where the children were fishing one morning and caught a large playing there are twenty
 seven on the pike we rowed across the lake to visit books a very large school they told another family
 where there were various us that mr whitaker s was the first children the father of whom has given house
 we should come to if we went a site on the edge of the lake for a straight on so
 we toiled on for a mile church which they hope to build soon or more but no house appeared and
 we had a very good dinner and pottered we could see no sign of one we were about round the
 farm very tired and undecided to go on or back eventually we decided to sit down eventually on thursday morning
 while i smoked a pipe soon we were whitaker returned full of apologies and both fast asleep and after sleeping
 about of the results of a long tour of inspechalf an hour i suddenly heard boustead tion he had made
 i had really come up jump up and say a cart was coming to help him as he was only
 a deacon we were lying among some trees in a but he had heard of my coming too late thickly
 wooded part boustead had a to make any arrangements it takes time villainous looking black hat on there to give
 notice of services we sat and were two girls in the cart and he must talked all the afternoon and
 he told me have presented a wild appearance as he about everything and it was very interrushed after them in
 a sleepy dazed esting he had been all alone in this state at first they seemed disinclined vast house for
 about two months and to stop but eventually told us that we ‘ g d whitaker was at that time
 a deacon in charge were right and had to go further on of the district 2 on the first parr
 of his trip to lac ia nonne rev creighton took this train to morinville the edmonton dunvegan and british columbia
 railway was being built from edmonton to the peace river area but had reached only the morinville district by 1910
 was beginning to feel lonely i think ful directions from whitaker a halfhe was glad to be able to talk
 things breed boy of about fourteen rode along over he said everything was already with me a good deal of
 the way acarranged for sunday i asked if there companied by a mare and a foal and was not anywhere
 i could go up country a couple of dogs so that we made a where people might like a celebration
 weird procession he amused me espec he told me of some very special keen ially when he said to me
 you smoke church people he had just discovered and then proceeded to take out a large and said he felt
 sure they would like pipe from his pocket fill it and smoke one so finally i decided to go there
 it we rode round the lake and all along was a half breed near by who had a the other
 side past a little wooden nice looking pony which i borrowed with church the roman catholics are putting a view
 to possible purchase i decided up for the half breeds to belvedere to try her first with whitaker so we
 rode about twelve miles away where a ferry over together the next afternoon to sion crosses the pembina river the
 river on some business about twenty miles is very fine about fifty yards wide with there and back we had
 supper with thickly wooded banks and there is a a delightful old couple who had come store and a stopping
 house there as well out from england the old man knew as a ferry quite a metropolis my halflittle about
 farming but was much re breed had left me and now i started spected and had been made a j
 p and along a most desolate trail the old secretary for the school and was church klondike trail along which
 so many warden for the church which is to be hundreds of people started when the built there we rode
 back in the dark rush was on while only two or three got and my pony carried me well and
 was through very quiet and no trouble the trail led for ten or eleven miles the next morning saturday i
 through densely wooded country rough started off on my trip having had care and hilly i hardly passed a shack
 au 3 the way just one or two and they were them in the evening with tricks and deserted i
 think it was indeed a wild making things from paper and card desolate country and i was wondering games where
 i was getting to at last i got to a shack and asked where i could get the next morning
 we had the service dinner it was late already and i found at 10 30 o clock i arranged a
 nice altar a norwegian living there all alone in went into the workshop and made a the woods he had
 done a little bit of wooden cross for it picked a few wild clearing and built a large barn and
 flowers and it all looked quite like a seemed delighted to see someone and little church the two brothers came
 said he felt very lonely at times he over and a number of prayer books and told me i should
 get to my destination hymn books were produced we had a in two miles so i took courage and rode
 congregation of eight and had the whole on till eventually the country opened morning service sang four hymns and out
 a little and i came to a place where i gave a little address it was a delightful two trails
 met and where there was a little service and they seemed to enjoy shack and a man sawing wood i
 ex it so much plained who i was and why i had come i left the paddle river in the
 afterhe seemed most delighted and at once noon and rode hack to the pembina took care of me and my
 horse talking this time on a different trail and crossed all the time drawing water from a well by a
 new ferry at lunnford called after showing me the stable and getting hay the ferryman lunn he had gone off
 he then asked me in and began to tell shooting so i tied the mare up and sat me his
 story everyone in this country and looked at the river which was has a story and they are all interesting
 lovely the afternoon being beautiful but this one was especially so he and eventually lunn appeared and i had his
 brother had come out in 1881 before a good talk with him he is from the i was born and
 had been in manitoba new forest the ferry has just been and had done well but had given up opened
 and is on what will be the main and gone to the argentine and then to trail from the peace
 river district one british columbia and in fact had wan or two waggon loads of strange rough dered all about
 and had not been to people from far away crossed eventual england since 1893 eventually they l i rode on
 into a new tract of country had decided to take a homestead and i came across two or three families
 of had settled there some four years one american methodists living together of them took me over to their married
 who were just coming from sunday sister s house a little way off in the school they directed me to
 a shack a woods this was a most delightful mile off the trail where an old methodist family rejoicing in
 life and in each preacher had taken up a homestead other s society they kept a spare room which he
 combined with religious work where the bed even had a sheet and i he was away taking a service but
 i saw was most comfortable the partitions his married daughter who lived close were thin and i could hear every
 sound by and his wife at first they regarded the baby was fretful all night and all me rather suspiciously
 but i soon made through my dreams i could hear the friends with them they professed great woman humming a
 hymn tune to keep surprise saying they had always reit quiet she did it so patiently and never garded the
 church of england and the complained and i was very touched english people generally as so stand the big boy
 was delightfully strong and offish they eventually thawed so much a great worker and he had a homestead as to
 suggest my staying the night at of his own as well the paddle river considerable personal inconvenience flows through their
 property and they but i refused they had a lovely place keep boats on it they had certainly on the
 river learnt to make the most of life and to make themselves as comfortable as pos i eventually got on
 to the trail again sible they had a carpenter s shed and and rode on as it was getting dark
 made nice furniture for the house the i had hoped to get put up at the shack children were delightful
 and i amused of some english people but they did not seem anxious to have me so i rode ship
 and the church had never been on about three miles through open represented there and there seemed country and shacks
 began to get closer good opportunities for making a start together i stopped at one and asked the methodists had
 been there but had a man who came out where i could get stopped the people seemed glad to be
 put up he asked me in to stay with visited then i rode on about five miles him he was
 an english bachelor and and left the trail to cut across country had only had the homestead a few home
 on the way i stopped at a shack months he had worked hard and built for dinner where i found
 a man and a a neat little log shack fenced in a bit woman repairing a fence they seemed of
 ground with some hay stacks in it decidedly superior and came from northwhere i let my pony loose broke fourteen
 umberland after dinner i made my way acres and dug a cellar he had been home and got back about
 4 p m out four years and had worked on various farms in the summer and had altogether it was
 a most interesting earned so much as 100 a month as a and illuminating trip it made me feel printer
 in the cities in the winter this what endless opportunities there were he had saved so that he had been
 able there is hardly anyone who has been in to set up on his homestead he gave me that part
 of the country more than four a good supper of cold mutton raisins years everything is new and beginning and
 coffee and we talked a good deal who is going to take the lead any of he struck me as
 being the type of a the settlers themselves this would really good colonist he was from lon doubtless be best
 if possible but is very don he had two wooden bunks in the difficult and settlers as a rule go
 simply corner on one of which i passed a pretty to get a living not to benefit the country uncomfortable
 night we were up before or will the presbyterian or methodist sunrise and had breakfast and when ministry take the
 lead this might again i had helped him wash up and had watered and saddled my pony i started headquarters
 of the archbishop s western on again and visited various english canada fund in northern alberta was st faith s
 anglican church in edmonton money from the people it was a newly developed town fund assisted in its construction 5
 be possible if the right men were sent years ago but never completed the but as a rule only a
 student who may be school had been stopped by the bachno older than eighteen is sent for the elors and
 settlers with children were summer i could hear nowhere of any moving away because they could not minister who was
 permanent and had get them educated a site for a church nothing else to do except to minister had been
 offered but nothing was done permanent men absolutely free from all as unsuitable methodist students had pecuniary relations with the
 people men been sent and there was no regular serof experience and tact are what seem to vice be needed
 each new township as it wednesday i spent quietly in the gets settled seems to require at least three things
 a school a town hall as morning i cooked the dinner in the it is called used for entertainments afternoon
 whitaker went off to take a dances debates etc and a church wedding and i had a hot bath under
 difficulties and tried to sketch but the as far as i could gather endless evening was too beautiful and i
 made a disputes and jealousies gathered round dismal failure on thursday i packed the erection of any of these in
 the town my knapsack and boustead rowed me ship if a settler made a move it was across the lake
 after which i walked in usually regarded as being done in his seven miles to sion had dinner with the
 own interest he gave a site for a church cotmans and took the mail stage to because he hoped it
 would develop his riviere qui barre conversing with a property he opposed the erection of a yankee man and woman
 and a wild school because he was a bachelor and irish boy of sixteen who drove us we did not
 want to pay the tax he moved got in at 6 p m and i stayed at the to get
 a hall built because he was a local hotel where i had a room to myself carpenter and hoped to
 get the job and a bed with sheets and was very often there was truth in such assertions comfortable the
 next morning i started but if a man could go in with no personal in to town on a waggon
 that was going interests to serve so that no possible in at 8 a m with a nice settler and
 his unworthy motives could be attributed to son from somewhere in the midlands him so much might be done we
 drove straight through without a stop thirty miles and got in soon after in one township i found that the
 3 p m i returned to find st faith s and foundations of a hall had been laid three the
 clergy house greatly advanced the wild west two montana whisky peddlers got into a dispute the other day at a
 place about four miles from calgary one of them known as buckskin shorty but whose proper name appears to be

 shot taking effect read threw a hammer at his opponent striking him in the face and injuring him seriously and
 in addition to this it seems he drew his knife a hand to hand struggle then took place and mcmanus
 succeeded in wresting it from him and knowing the desperate character of his antagonist determined to save his own life
 by sacrificing if necessary that of his unfortunate opponent he plunged the knife into his neck and happening to strike
 a vein read bled to death in a few minutes mcmanus made no attempt to escape but quietly submitted to
 arrest telling the officer that he was compelled to do what he did in self defense calgary will soon become

 prediction of the other come out to follow his lead and that literally verified they would be satisfied to do
 whatever he advised the man who didn t miss how medicine hat was named however spoke up and said that
 he had come out to have what with grim humor there is a certain part of the south saskatchewan river

 winters no ice added to kill or be killed when his forms this opening in the river is reonly boy

 winter 1893 which on hearing this little gun asked the was more than usually severe i was young men if
 they were willing to go asked by the blackfoot indians whether and attack the enemy and they said it had
 frozen over on learning that the they were then said little gun opening was still there the indians half of
 us will never see our homes evinced great delight had it been otheragain or if over half of us should
 return wise they would have taken it as proof from the fight every one will be that the great spirit
 had either died wounded i am no coward as you know or gone elsewhere to some other breathand i will
 go with you but i think my ing place brother in law has done wrong in inducing you to undertake
 this fight this i far back in indian tradition it is said know that neither he nor i will ever

 camp finding himself m o r t a 11 y purpose of carrying some share of the wounded and unable
 to take any further travelling outfit part in the battle he passed his gun to one of the young men
 telling him to one evening the indian camped by make good use of it and in case he the river

 the river rethat it might do effective work in the ferred to the serpent appeared to him fight as for
 me he said i am going and told him that if he would throw the to see my boy flesh
 of his wife into the opening he would become a great warrior and medi notwithstanding that they were so cine

 the grand of it rightly concluding that the lodge mother s side of red lake chippewa and the horse were
 the property of the indian blood and in addition to his chief of the sioux he determined to get reputation
 for bravery he was ac the horse by the short method of killing counted one of the shrewdest as well
 his owner pulling aside the flap of the as the most honest of the red men with lodge he found
 that the end of the lariat whom the whites had to deal he was by which the horse was secured

 of the horse and silver creek below fort ellice he was dashed at headlong speed through the in every respect
 one of nature s noble now thoroughly aroused camp before men if ever there was one he reached his own
 men he killed two he was in his earlier manhood a more of the sioux but was too busy to
 recognized leader among his tribe and spare time to scalp them no man s reputation stood higher for when he
 reached his own band the personal bravery or skill as the head fight became general and resulted in of a
 party of the warpath the total rout of the sioux twelve of one time he started out with about whom

 the prairie sod by mrs f m cantlon one of the first plows to bite into the virgin soil of
 the huge expanse of flat treeless prairie land near chinook alberta was in the year of 1917 l k sulley
 a real estate dealer who lived in cereal at that time had purchased huge tracks of land planning to have
 this soil broken cropped at least once then sell it to prcspective buyers my husband w t cantlon owned a
 big gas tractor and ten bottom plow and seeing mr sully s ad in a farm paper early that spring
 he applied for the job of plowing and breaking his application was accepted almost by return mail and as i
 had a desire to see the widely advertised sunny southern alberta i followed my husband a month later a caboose
 was procured and when i time making the thirty odd miles in arrived it was all ready to be occupied
 about twelve to fifteen hours putting having spent my former years in south the horse in the livery barn we
 would em manitcba where there were trees check in at the only hotel in town then fences telephone poles and
 many build the next day do our shopping we ings i was not prepared for what met always gave satan
 that day to rest up my eyes when i arrived at the camp arriving home on the evening of the
 i will admit i had to swallow twice third day before answering the inevitable well how do you like the
 set up in every naturally there was no way of keepdirection one looked there was nothing ing our fresh meat
 butter or milk so but flat treeless land without even a my husband dug a hole partly under fence or
 rcad to break the monotony the caboose he tacked a wire screen away in the distance we could see some
 on a frame to cover the hole placing thing which at first appeared to be just plow shares on top
 of it to keep any a mound of earth but later we found marauding animal from molesting the that it
 was a sod shanty that was the food in our improvised cellar we would only obstacle to break the view
 the put the food in a pail and tie a long only redeeming feature of this table flat rope on
 the handle leaving the other land was the beautiful sunrises and sun end of the rope on top of the
 ground sets they were surely breath taking this served the purpose very well although at best the fresh meat would
 our nearest town to the job was become rather old tasting before the chinook more than thirty miles from two
 weeks were up so our main meat where we were camped our only mode had to be the smoked hams
 and sides of transportation was an old broken of bacon down retired racehorse with sore feet which we christened satan
 due to we used so much canned goods that his unusually mean disposition the the piles of empty tin cans
 shining in buggy was a rickety lop sided top less the sun were guide posts to the boss affair which
 threatened to fall apart at whenever he came out to check on the any time progress of the job as
 one section was broke we would move on to the next when we needed a fresh supply of so the
 tin can piles served their purpose groceries which was about every two well weeks my husband would leave the job
 of plowing to the other man and we sometimes becoming lonely out on would start out early in the morning
 the prairie i would go out and sit on satan being what he was took his own the platform of
 the plow and go a few mrs cant on is a pioneer residtnt who now lives at hardisty 22 this
 was the tractor used by w t cantloi in breaking the prairie near chinook in 1917 it was a gas
 tractor drawing ten bottom plough rounds i shall never forget the sight quite happy from 1915 to 1917 they of
 ten furrows being turned over at once had accumulated a few hens turkeys the rich chocolate colored loam shining and
