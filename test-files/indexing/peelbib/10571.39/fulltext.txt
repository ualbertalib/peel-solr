 4 editor s page as is obvious from its appearance this year s patrician has undergone many changes the aim 
 of these changes has been to make the patrician more interesting to all members of the regiment financial pressures have 
 forced us to severely restrict the size of the publication and to omit some familiar features however the newsletter will 
 be expanded to include as many of the omitted features as possible this edition of the patrician contains a variety 
 of different and interesting articles the photoessays 0:photo 0:essays of first and third battalions provide a much better description of 
 the present day infantryman s 0:infantry 0:man 0:s life than mere words second battalion s article will certainly bring back 
 vivid memories to those of us fortunate enough to have been a part of their magnificent kapyong celebrations colonel stone 
 s letter and the photographs of the ppcli memorial at kapyong serve as a reminder that even after 25 years 
 the heroism and self sacrifice of those who served in korea is still vividly remembered major dick patterson s story 
 on the award of the first korean student bursary is a tribute to those who generously supported this worthwhile project 
 as the editor i have taken the liberty of reprinting major general spry s article entitled the history of the 
 colonel of the regiment as a reminder to us all that the colonel of the regiment is no mere figurehead 
 but a leader actively involved in all aspects of our regimental life finally i have taken the liberty of publishing 
 excerpts from letters written by 599 maddison h p these reminiscences 0:reminiscen 0:ces of the early days in world war 
 one have a timeless value and are as pertinent today as they were then although our articles cover the spectrum 
 of the regiment s history we still have not achieved our aim for the patrician the patrician is in fact 
 an unofficial history of the regiment it is a place to record the present activities of the regular portion of 
 the regiment and also a place for the personal recollections of those who performed the deeds recorded in the official 
 volumes of the regimental history it is also a place where the anecdotes and incidents which have had their role 
 in shaping the character of the regiment can be recorded to the originals and other veterans of the great war 
 whose contributions have appeared regularly in the patrician and the newsletter i extend my thanks to those who have followed 
 especially the veterans of the second world war and korea i can only urge you to again follow the examples 
 of our predecessors and give all patricias the benefit of your experiences the regimental museum continues to prosper and to 
 increase its already high reputation the museum has now been incorporated under the aegis of the hamilton gault memorial fund 
 and is therefore recognized by the federal government as a charitable organization contributions to the museum will now be acknowledged 
 in the regimental newsletter and receipts suitable for income tax purposes will be issued to all future donors once again 
 our biggest weakness in the museum is a lack of artifacts and photographs of the second world war and korean 
 war periods and all contributions from those periods would be particularly welcome i again remind all persons concerned that commencing 
 with this issue the patrician will be published annually on 30 november and that contributions are due in regimental headquarters 
 by 15 september 
 5 message from the colonel of the regiment major general c b ware dso cd this new format is the 
 result of very serious study concerning the future of the patrician representatives of all ranks of the regiment and the 
 regimental association have devoted much time and effort to the project and i should like to thank them all i 
 properly would make special mention of the members of the patrician review and the ways and means committee who ably 
 chaired by major grey and the vice patron of the association brig gen j a de lalanne produced the major 
 recommendations which have been acted upon this year as with so many publications inflation and steeply rising costs have hit 
 the patrician heavily however the survival of our regimental 0:reg 0:imental journal has been adjudged to be non negotiable it 
 will record annually the highlights of our on going endeavours and the men who shall make history the continued success 
 of the journal depends less on finances than on its ability to adequately record those highlights in a manner which 
 is meaningful to our young soldiers and veterans alike this is the object and the literary contributions and other support 
 of both serving men and association members are required as never before this support lam certain shall be forthcoming in 
 full measure and i am sure that the patrician shall go forward with renewed vigour and strength and continue to 
 play its strong part in our regimental life

 november 12th we are full of memories of a wonderful trip to korea made possible by the generosity of the 
 korean authorities and the trustees of regimental fund of ppcli on arrival in korea we were met by major dick 
 patterson and several prominent korean citizens the day s schedule was very tight and included an official call on his 
 excellency the canadian ambassador and then to the headquarters of the united nations 0:na 0:tions korean war veterans association i 
 had conferred on me several impressive honours including the korean service veterans medal a large decoration to be worn something 
 like the order of the garter scrolls designating me ambassador for peace honorary member of the korean veterans association and 
 a framed metal plaque beautifully badged recognizing my contribution to the cause of freedom in korea esther received a lovely 
 vase lacquered and inlaid with mother of pearl unkwaa then hosted a fantastic luncheon and we retired to our hotel 
 full of booze and food that night we dined at the canadian embassy with h e mr j stiles and 
 his charming wife dick patterson and kathy charming and beautiful were in the party several prominent koreans and their ladies 
 plus members of the embassy staff mr stiles is an excellent representative of canada and a good host he is 
 aided and abetted by a charming chatelaine in the person of mrs stiles dick and kathy patterson drove us home 
 quite fatigued after 17 hours of flying and a very full day we first visited the commonwealth memorial an impressive 
 structure dedicated to the honour of the men of the several nations of the british commonwealth who fought in the 
 korean war the ambassador his wife and several members of the embassy staff attended with us then on to naechon 
 the village near which the regimental memorial is located there was a tremendous 0:tremen 0:dous crowd in attendance and before 
 the ceremony started a gaggle of general officers such as i have never seen before joined the assembly wreath laying 
 followed the speeches in this order the honourable suh jyong chul minister of national defence lt gen john j burns

 and the man responsible for most of the arranging was mr kap chong chi he was also master of ceremonies 
 and did an outstanding job at the ceremony i met jo kim who will be remembered by many patricia s 
 as our rok liaison officer and interpreter what a lovely man we exchanged many memories and he invited me with 
 esther and dick and kathy patterson to dine with him jo is now a very prosperous business man who travels 
 extensively in europe after the ceremony we joined the embassy staff in a picnic in a chestnut grove on the 
 other side of the kapyong river before leaving my account of the kapyong ceremony i must say that i had 
 a hard time getting oriented suddenly the terrain became familiar and i could recall the deployment of the battalion on 
 the ground i had not time to explore but i did see the track which we used to get the 
 battalion hq vehicles and the mortar half tracks into the reentrant 0:re 0:entrant from which we had that beautiful shoot 
 up of chinese forces in the early hours of april 25 1951 i hope that lloyd hill reads this he 
 will have vivid memories that night we were the guests of the korean national tourism corporation after a wonderful meal 
 we saw one of the greatest night club shows that it has been my pleasure to witness the dances were 
 mostly korean folk dances speeded up for night club audiences but the girls were out of this world oh to 
 be twenty five and have a harem full of them if any of your readers visit korea walker hill is 
 a must on november bth we flew to pusan and visited the commonwealth 0:common 0:wealth cemetery i took a photograph 
 of the headstone of rsm james woods if it turns out well i will send a print for his widow 
 the cemetery is well located beautifully kept and is well worth a visit pusan has changed out of all recognition 
 it does not even smell the same as it did in 1950 we returned to seoul and were taken to 
 dinner in the private dining room of a korean restaurant where we dined korean style wonderful food mine made all 
 the tastier by the ministrations of a beautiful kaesong girl the korean equivalent of the japanese geisha my thoughts were 
 forty years younger than my body on sunday we went to a memorial service in the crypt of the anglican 
 cathedral we lunched at the united nations mess did some shopping in the afternoon and returned to the mess for 
 dinner and a movie on monday november 10th dick patterson don thompson 0:thomp 0:son dva don collier canadian embassy and 
 i drove to panjumnong 0:pan 0:jumnong as you know it is the armistice site of the korean war it is 
 manned by both north korea and the united nations with a camp of swiss and polish observers in their midst 
 there is absolutely no fraternizing between sides and the communists have been the instigators 0:in 0:stigators for two or three 
 very ugly incidents the americans on duty there impressed me as being among the smartest troops that i have ever 
 seen we were briefed by a member of the jsa staff and taken by un vehicle to the site of 
 the armstice the north korean guards look surly and are untidy but the us troops make me glad that they 
 are on our side on our return to seoul we did some shopping then on to the hotel to clean 
 up for dinner jo kim and his wife bona were our hosts that evening a wonderful meal in a truly 
 korean domestic environment a beautiful house excellently decorated and furnished exotic food admirably presented made this one of the memorable 
 evenings of our lives on november 11th dick patterson his assistant sergeant macisaac major j harris british army a royal 
 engineer 0:en 0:gineer corporal with a reme sergeant for a driver and i headed for the demilitarized zone in a 
 british army land rover once we left the paved roads and took to the hills it was my korea without 
 much change except for the absence of crowds of vehicles and the korean porters and no shelling we twisted along 
 tracks up and down hill and viewed from several ops the demarkation fences and the demilitarized zone pheasants abound for 
 no guns are allowed to be fired in the zone 355 little gibraltar 159 225 166 the hook and various 
 other hills that we blessed or cursed in 1951 were readily identified perhaps because i had dick patterson with me 
 who is an excellent map reader among his other attributes it was a most interesting trip although quite tiring to 
 a decrepit old sod like me we crossed the imjin going north over teal bridge and made a side trip 
 to the site of pintail the return trip through uijombu was an eye opener new shops on both sides of 
 the road and a rapidly expanding city that will soon be joined with seoul we left korea at 2230 hours 
 ministered right up to the last minute by dick patterson at los angeles we were met by mr gun rha 
 assistant 0:assis 0:tant director of the korean national tourism corporation in los angeles 0:an 0:geles who had kindly arranged for 
 accommodation for the night on november 12th cpa took us to vancouver and pwa to victoria where a car arranged 
 by major 808 burns met us and took us home i brought back with me a rock from the kapyong 
 river which in time i hope to make into a miniature replica of the kapyong monument 0:mon 0:ument i will 
 present it to the museum when it is finished i reiterate my gratitude to the various korean agencies who were 
 so generous and kind to my wife and me to dick and kathy patterson and to the trustees of the 
 ppcli regimental fund which paid our expenses to los angeles and back address by colj r stone dso and bar

 prepared to use force to uphold 0:up 0:hold the ideals for which the un was founded none fought harder and 
 sacrificed more than the korean people themselves therefore this monument not only commemorates the part played by the princess patricias

 10 two new memorials at kapyong on the seventh of november 1975 on the twenty fifth anniversary of the landing 
 of the first large party of canadian soldiers in korea for the korean conflict a monument to the princess patricia 
 s canadian light infantry was unveiled on the banks of the kapyong river some thirty five kilometres northwest of seoul 
 korea this monument 0:monu 0:ment is dedicated to all canadians who participated in the war but with special reference to 
 the second battalion ppcli and that battalion s 0:bat 0:talion 0:s gallant stand on the heights above the memorial during 
 the battle of kapyong which marked the end of the chinese peoples volunteers spring offensive in april 1951 during this 
 critical battle 2 ppcli the only canadian battalion in korea at the time was part of the 27th commonwealth brigade 
 along with the third battalion royal australian regiment they received the us presidential distinguished 0:distin 0:guished unit citation for this 
 action there are many elaborate monuments in korea most erected by the republic of korea government to honour those countries 
 which fought here one of the first monuments to be built was the commonwealth 0:com 0:monwealth memorial at kapyong town 
 a modest structure by later standards this memorial was erected by a private organization the united nations korean war allies 
 association under the directorship of mr chi kap chong in 1968 to honour the contributions of australia canada new zealand 
 and the united kingdom with much the same idea in mind mr chi and his organization conceived and built jhis 
 latest rather simple structure based on a natural stone of the kapyong area he was insistent that unlike many other 
 memorials this one would be on the actual site of the battle in fact there is a diagram of the 
 battle on a small plinthe to the left of the monument from where on looking up you can see the 
 hills on which 2 ppcli fought the unveiling ceremony was attended by many diplomatic and military dignitaries from the republic 
 of korea us forces and the allied nations canada was represented by he mr john a stiles the canadian ambassador 
 in seoul and mr d m thompson from our department of veterans affairs a special guest was col j r 
 stone retired who commanded 2 ppcli during the kapyong battle and who was awarded the second bar to his dso 
 for his leadership there col and mrs stone were the guests of the korean government through the korean national tourist 
 corporations veterans revisit programme in an interesting sidelight at the ceremony col stone re met mr y j kirn a 
 businessman 0:business 0:man who as a lieutenant in the rok army during the korean war had been the liaison officer 
 to the canadian forces in general and for the period of the battle to col stones headquarters jo kirn came 
 to the ceremony in response to a press announcement and neither knew the other would be there it made for 
 a happy reunion in his speech of thanks from the regiment to the unkwaa and the people of kapyong gun 
 county col stone announced that acting on a suggestion by mr chi kap chong the serving and pastserving 0:past 0:serving 
 members of the regiment had been collecting monies in a special fund to create a bursary to be given annually 
 to a child of that district to go to middle school grade 7 whereas primary school is free in the 
 republic it costs a family approximately 150 00 per year for a child to attend middle school more for high 
 school such funds are very difficult for parents to come by in a rural community 0:com 0:munity such as this 
 in col stone s words the regiment wished to reciprocate with a living memorial with the first award of 150 
 00 being made in march 1976 the beginning of the korean school year on march sth 1976 major r n 
 patterson ppcli the liaison officer for canada to the united nations command military armistice commission in seoul in the company 
 of mr chi kap chong presented 0:pre 0:sented the first bursary from the trustees of the hamilton gault memorial fund 
 on behalf of the colonel of the regiment and all ranks of princess patricia s canadian light infantry to a 
 young student from kapyong at a small ceremony at the kapyong north middle school the student park sung chull was 
 chosen by a county committee of educationalists chaired by mr kirn tae soo the county chief park is a farmer 
 s son who happens to live in the village behind the memorial and just below the hill on which the 
 battle opened against b company twenty five years ago of 145 candidates for middle school park stood first and so 
 it is expected that he will put the patricia scholarship to good use he impressed the presenter as a young 
 man who takes it all very seriously as befits the possessor of a living memorial 
 11 colonel of the regiment mgen d c spry editor s note this abridged article just appeared in volume 2 
 edition 4 of the mobile command letter and is reproduced with the kind permission of the author and of the 
 editor of mobile command letter and now i am colonel of the regiment a tremendous honour wrote field marsh viscount 
 montgomery of alamein in his memoirs today the appointment has been called that efficient and necessary anomaly the colonel of 
 the regiment how did it all begin the title is certainly not understood by the public as a whole indeed 
 it is hardly understood in part of the army itself for an answer we must at least go back to 
 the birth of the standing army at the restoration of king charles 11 but even before that one can say 
 the regimental system was introduced in about 1580 the reason for the adoption of the regiment whose commanding officer ranked 
 as a colonel was to fill the gap in the chain of command between the general and his staff and 
 the basic tactical unit the company or troop under a captain before the establishment of the permanent standing army the 
 relationship of the colonel with the king was much like that of contractor and client if the king wished to 
 fight a war he would commission peers or other worthies as colonels to raise troops for that purpose not only 
 did the colonel command his troops in battle but he also raised equipped and trained them within the financial limits 
 set by the king so much a head per soldier he also made what profits he could out of the 
 transaction in the standing army which was created after the restoration the colonel continued to be regarded both as commanding 
 officer and proprietor his regiment carried his crest on its drum and colours and it was known by its colonel 
 s name e g wolfe s wade s or howard s at that it was regarded to be quite normal 
 and regular for a colonel to make a living out of his regiment the financial direction of the regiment lay 
 with the colonel and its financial affairs were conducted by the colonel s clerk known later as the regimental agent 
 all cash was handed over by the paymaster general to the agent out of this the men were paid their 
 subsistence and a fixed proportion of their pay known as the off reckonings were retained by the agent to meet 
 the cost of recruitment and clothing but not arms which were purchased on a regimental basis from contractors any profits 
 went into the pockets of the colonel but there was no check at all on what happened to the money 
 after it reached the colonel or his agent the colonel was responsible to the crown both for the maintenance of 
 his unit and for its discipline colonels were expected to serve with their regiments but from the first it was 
 considered that general e g command or staff and regimental appointments were not mutually exclusive a general in command could 
 also retain the colonelcy of his regiment the colonelcy was also held at the king s pleasure and came to 
 be regarded as a reward for distinction it became the exception rather than the rule for the colonel to hold 
 colonel s rank and as the 18th century advanced there was increasing tendency for colonelcies to be held by senior 
 officers of great age who drew the income from their regiments but did not have time to go near them 
 even if they had the inclination to do so it was evident that the system gave both the colonel excessive 
 powers and led to gross misuse of public money reform was therefore ultimately inevitable the decisive step was the transfer 
 of responsibility for distributing pay from the colonels to the war office in 1783 however the colonels remained responsible 0:res 
 0:ponsible for providing clothing from the men s off reckonings which were 25 per cent of the soldier s daily 
 pay in 1855 the colonels responsibility for clothing was commuted for a handsome annual salary of 1 000 pounds a 
 year or more depending 0:de 0:pending on the regiment a house of commons committee on army promotion and retirement which 
 reported in 1876 accepted the view of the commander in chief the duke of cambridge that paid colonelcies should be 
 retained as a means of rewarding outstandingly 0:out 0:standingly meritorious service but this was swept away by the reforming zeal 
 of lord cardwell in 1881 the salary was removed and colonelcies were made entirely honorary the colonelcy thus became an 
 unpaid distinction one of an increasing number that could be bestowed on a deserving general officer so matters might have 
 rested had not the army council in 1920 offered a travelling allowance to regimental colonels and tactfully stated its view 
 that a colonelcy was a duty as well as an honour the council take this opportunity of pointing out that 
 the colonel of the regiment should be in truth and not in name only one to whom the whole regiment 
 should look up the council suggested three possible fields of activity nominating suitable candidates for commissions carrying out liaison with 
 the war office and giving advice on regiment charities for which the council remarked the colonel s attention appears essential 
 and in this manner the colonelcies continued until after world war 11 so what is the role of colonels of 
 regiments today it is paradoxical 0:para 0:doxical that with much smaller regiments than were presided over by their predecessors of 
 the last few generations they have to work that much harder to preserve what remains normally a colonel is selected 
 by his regiment the wishes of the senior officers past and present and the commanding officers representing the views of 
 their senior officers being taken into account the colonel s tenure of appointment is initially for five years this may 
 be extended to a maximum of ten years the colonel is the guardian of regimental traditions he fosters esprits de 
 corps and represents regimental interests the colonel also fosters such alliances as there may be with regiments of the armies 
 of british commonwealth countries the domestic affairs of the regiment as a whole are very much his concern and these 
 include charities funds properties chapels museums and memorials the colonel deals with all matters affecting 0:af 0:fecting a colonel in 
 chief of his regiment how does the colonel of the regiment carry out his duties apart from the endless correspondence 
 dealt with at home or at regimental 0:regi 0:mental headquarters there are visits to the battalions wherever they may be 
 to command and national defence headquarters and other regular military organizations connected with the regiment the chairmanship of regimental committees 
 presiding at the regimental 0:regi 0:mental functions including the old comrades reunions and meetings with periodic attendance at their branch 
 functions commemorative visits to the various battle sites in which the regiment has distinguished itself usually with a party of 
 old comrades it is important to add that the traditional acknowledgement of the position of the colonel is that the 
 regimental colour is trooped i e displayed on a ceremonial parade given for him 
 12 roles 1 the honorary colonel should be a complete and vocal advocate of the military system and be a 
 true supporter of the soldier this requirement may include undertaking public speaking on occasions and will certainly include speaking on

 to the units and to the commanding officers 2 the honorary colonel should act as an adviser to the commanding 
 officers of his units on all regimental matters 3 he should ensure that regimental dress customs and uniformity 0:uni 0:formity 
 are maintained and that dress regulations and orders are obeyed or that changes or variations are requested to cater for 
 any differences in regimental or unit dress 4 the honorary colonel should advise on non public fund administration and on

 it applies to his particular unit if the regimental system continues to exist in the infantry only then will there 
 be any hope of maintaining it as a viable concept in canada s defence forces the colonel of the regiment 
 may be called a father figure but his job is no sinecure as sir arthur bryant wrote the essence and 
 soul of the british army will be found in its regimental history and field marshal montgomery writing of the infantry 
 their fighting spirit is based largely on morale and regimental esprit de corps and the colonel of the regiment is 
 there to see it his post indeed is a tremendous honour one man s war 599 maddison h p editor 
 s note the following has been condensed from a series of letters written over a period of one year the 
 title was not selected by mr maddison but it is a phrase selected out of context from one of his 
 letters although more than sixty years have passed since i left the regiment 0:regi 0:ment to go back for a 
 commission my memories of the patricias remain as bright as ever i left edmonton with the gang on thursday 13 
 august 1914 sid badley 514 fowler 656 page 734 the company cut up and king 863 were among those who 
 made the trip memorable badley became the pay sergeant but turned in his stripes after we went to the barracks 
 at ypres and was killed on 8 may page was a friendly soul full of practical jokes that he played 
 on many of us though never to hurt king was a short dark fellow who had been with the san 
 carlos opera company when they folded in edson alta king had a powerful bass baritone voice and he and page 
 taught us to sing spagoni to while away the time on arrival in landsdowne park we were quartered in machinery 
 hall where we tried to sleep on the racks each morning at a very ungodly hour the pipe band would 
 wend their way between the racks and in the glass enclosure the noise was deafening on the second morning king 
 and page brought us all to our feet with a roaring rendition of spagoni which blotted out the pipers and 
 that became the daily program from that day on now while i m on landsdowne park may i say that 
 i believe i was the first hospital casualty in the regiment the weather was hot the rideau canal ran behind 
 the building so we all went swimming there being only one diving board i took a flying leap and landed 
 in the water feet first some minutes later my left foot began to smart floating i found that i had 
 cut the left foot badly stretcher bearers arrived in due course a tourniquet was applied and i went by truck 
 to carlton general where i spent six days and received 0:re 0:ceived many stitches the hospital tried to keep me 
 till my bill was paid but i had no money so walked out when simpson came to tell me that 
 the regiment was about to embark on the megantic he helped me to hobble down to the train by the 
 time we reached levis my foot was fine when we left sternwerke on that two day trip to our first 
 stay in the trenches i had been issued a new pair of very heavy boots to replace 0:re 0:place the 
 canadian issue the new ones were size 12 i was used to size 9 2 so i landed in the 
 mud and slime with two raw blisters and spent the entire first day wondering how long it took to get 
 trench foot when they called for volunteers for rations i stood up anything was better than the mud and filth 
 at the ration drop i was given a mail sack half full of cooked chunks of beef it weighed around 
 80 lbs two men loaded it on to my shoulders and i started back at the end of the party 
 but i soon stopped and decided that i d never make it back to the company after studying the problem 
 i went back to the dump and got four sand bags and a length of twine i filled the four 
 sand bags with some of the best pieces of meat and tied them in pairs slung over my shoulder they 
 made much easier carrying i got back to the line about an hour after the party that was i believe 
 the only time we got fresh cooked meat in the line from my experience with the ration party i decided 
 that i d be happier as a guide so when cpl peplar called for a companion i put my hand 
 up a week or so after that it could have been the night that peplar was killed 8 platoon was 
 sent into reserve in an estaminet we called the white horse cellar i remember very vividly leading the way in 
 and as i went down the stairs to the basement i happened to glance into the tun room on the 
 left my flashlight caught a gleaming pair of yellow eyes glaring in the darkness i remember stumbling down the last 
 few steps after the platoon was settled down i called dick fowler 600 to light a candle and follow me 
 back up the stairs 
 13 i put a round in the breech fixed my bayonet and crept silently up the stairs as dick s 
 candle illuminated the hole a large goat jumped out and headed for the outdoors that was the first of the 
 regimental 0:regi 0:mental goat cpl brown was my next partner he went sick and i never saw him again lcpl 
 wheeler was next and he was wounded next was macdonald who had cooked for us at winchester mac still had 
 greasy pants when we got together i think mac was killed but i don t remember we also had a 
 problem with our great coats when we came out of that first trip into the mud and water mine weighed 
 35 kilos the bottom was at least two inches thick so i cut the mud off and left the white 
 pockets showing below the cloth a few days later we were issued goat skin jackets without sleeves they kept us 
 warm but how they did smell when it rained we surely didn t look like soldiers in those days but 
 we all looked alike and no one complained my next partner was mckenzie a big raw boned scot from one 
 of the highland regiments on feb 18th we guides were in the brewery with bn h q at about two 
 pm six of us lay down in a large steel tank for a nap mac and i were in the 
 center it was well screened by other vats and chimneys and seemed very safe but suddenly i got an urge 
 to get to heck out of there i was halfway 0:half 0:way down the stairs to the basement when a 
 shell landed in the vat and mac and one other guide were killed and the other three were wounded that 
 night to help calm my jitters col farquhar and capt buller used me as their guide to the lines they 
 were kindness to the nth degree and i settled down at the small lake which separated 1 and 2 trenches 
 they told me to report to csm mcdonnell and get a new partner i ll never forget the raucous laughter 
 that went up when i asked sgt bevington for a partner someone yelled the hoodoo wants a new partner getting 
 no response i started back by myself which was entirely wrong running struggling and mad as hell i reached the 
 road that led to the brasserie where h q was at this point i fell over a wire that the 
 engineers were laying for phone and knocked myself out they took me to battalion h q thinking that they had 
 caught a spy the medical sergeant thought that i was malingering and gave me hell but major keenan came in 
 in time and lent me a large flask full of hennessy told the orderly to take me to my quarters 
 and see that my wet clothes were dried by noon the next day i had settled down but i never 
 had a companion 0:com 0:panion guide after that this was feb 18th and 19th col farquhar was killed feb 20th 
 on sunday march 14th i was given one stripe largely to cover my duties as a guide that night i 
 guided 2 coy up to the mound in the attempt to retake the trenches lost by the irish brigade 82nd 
 we made two more trips into the trenches in this area before moving 0:mov 0:ing to poperingue i did not 
 have a companion for those trips nor ever again though i did manage to tie in with one of the 
 other companies several times and on occasion i took returnees or small drafts from the 500 i remember going in 
 to the trenches my diary says april 14th in front of polygon wood i recall spending the night using my 
 bayonet like an adze to enlarge the poorly made blazings on the trees which served as guides for our travel 
 also removed a lot of limbs and other debris to make our travel a lot easier i note that i 
 went out for rations on the 15th and 16th on the 16th i wrote wet dark long and tiring trip 
 my recollection here is of utter blackness with no star shells going up our road in was by way of 
 the ypres comines railroad it was so dark that i could not keep my feet in line with the tracks 
 i tried rubbing my sole plate along the rail but the gun would slip off finally i fixed my bayonet 
 reversed the rifle and used the point of the bayonet in the inner curve of the rail we got to 
 the lines in time but i had two wounded this was the only time any of my convoys suffered casualties 
 the regiment came out and back to the barracks on the 17th in case you don t know the belgian 
 barracks at ypres were all brick with tile roofs and belgian blocks for paving when fritzie hit anywhere near there 
 they got a lot of ready made shrapnel fritzie was using the big bertha gun then it took from 20 
 to 22 minutes to swab and reload the monster so we had plenty of time to travel between shots but 
 on the morning of the 19th when we were all in the huge lavatory washroom latrine area doing the sss 
 they suddenly played us a dirty trick by opening up with a second big bertha i got caught with my 
 pants down and a load of brick dust in my underwear from then on travel was much more difficult though 
 as i think of it now it wouldn t have made any difference for if one hit close nothing would 
 save us i remember cqms lofts 3 coy so very thoroughly because on the night of april 25th i had 
 gone out for rations shelling was very heavy and the transport was waiting in the lee of a brick wall 
 on the outskirts of st jean to elaborate i took in two days rations on that day with or without 
 a ration party but probably with a small group of returnees major adamson at that time informed me that cqms 
 foden had made wo and that i was now a cqms i remember him kiddingly saying that with my titles 
 of lc plus orderly corporal plus company guide and now a cqms i was carrying enough load so his inability 
 to supply stripes and a crown should not worry me i left the ration party at the lille gate and 
 gone back to intercept the transport which had been delayed by the shelling st jean was wiped out that night 
 when the order came to go forward with the rations cqms lofts jumped onto 2 rig so i perforce took 
 3 ten seconds later a direct hit took lofts and the entire t 2 load that was one of many 
 times my guardian angel took me under his wing i think that it was on that trip that i found 
 the body and motorcycle 0:motor 0:cycle of a dispatch rider who had ridden into a clump of bushes and was 
 still sitting upright in the saddle he had apparently been hit by shrapnel and had coasted into the bushes where 
 he had died i took the dispatch case up to the lines with me and came back and buried him 
 later while talking with major adamson i had asked permission to bring in a sack of mail and a few 
 packages for 2 coy using the motorcycle he had agreed but cautioned me not to haul too big a load 
 the next day i went into erquingham where the transport was located and picked up all the letters for the 
 coy plus selected packages for the officers including two cartons of major adamson s lataika cigarettes the load was pretty 
 bulky on the cycle and as i neared the point where i had found it a burst of shrapnel caused 
 me to swing the wheel and land in a shell hole my left knee began to swell with water and 
 i hobbled in with my loot for several days the knee was stiff on the day that premier borden inspected 
 us 2 coy like the other three was in one thin line of 31 men with cqms scott in front 
 and lcpl maddison in rear before the inspection scott was called to the front and made wo that left me 
 as oc 2 company my memory here is that capt ro earl and three louies came on the scene right 
 after the inspection and my reign as oc ended quickly but for circumstances i might well made commission with the 
 pats as it was i had to come back to canada for my commission and later was appointed to staff 
 on m d 13 under general criukshanks but i d have much rather have stayed with the regiment 
 14 first battalion the first battalion has enjoyed an active year from the change of command parade to operation gamescan 
 76 the year has been interspersed with service at home and abroad members of the battalion have travelled as far 
 south as australia and as far north as narvik norway our tasks have been diverse and challenging varying from participation 
 in an amf l conventional operations exercise to assisting the civil authority at the olympic games patricias have found themselves 
 in the jungles of queensland on a foot run between victoria and calgary and in the frozen wastes of resolute 
 bay throughout this demanding period the unit has displayed excellence 0:excel 0:lence at competition as evidenced by the return to 
 the home station of the hamilton gault and skill at arms trophies in addition to the regimental competitions the delivery 
 point and forced march trophies were won at waincon 75 all things being equal it has been a successful interesting 
 and challenging year change of command the foremost event of the year was the change of command ceremonies 0:cere 0:monies 
 conducted during waincon 75 the battalion assembled on centurion field to witness the ritual as lcol j l sharpe cd 
 relinquished 0:rel 0:inquished his command to lcol k r foster cd as befitted the occasion a beautiful day and a 
 battalion roll past set the stage with which to bid a fond farewell to lcol sharpe the colonel of the 
 regiment m gen c b ware dso cd a favourite with the troops at any time was on hand to 
 receive the salute during the roll past also attending the ceremonies was the norwegian ambassador to canada thereby symbolizing the 
 importance of lcol foster s command 0:com 0:mand of the battalion which was destined to assume the amf l role 
 later in the year feu de joie first battalion princess patricia s canadian light infantry will fire a feu de 
 joie with these words and three rippling volleys of fire a 100 man guard of honour saluted calgary s centennial 
 on 10 july this traditional ceremony was one of the highlights of the 1 ppcli participation in the stampede and 
 centennial celebrations the guard commanded by maj d j campbell and well trained by mwo buxton performed the intricate drills 
 flawlessly and precisely the musical ability of the ppcli band and the 1 ppcli corps of drums added a great 
 deal to the ceremony and was most appreciated by all while all participants deserve congratulations for a fine show special 
 mention must be made of the 50 men who in addition to preparing for this parade had to simultaneously train 
 for and participate 0:partici 0:pate in quite a different ceremony as part of the calgary stampede grandstand show this group 
 under the command of capt ray trowhill and also trained by mwo buxton performed nightly during the stampede ex parloff 
 run the idea for ex parloff run as it was later to be called was first conceived in early spring 
 and initiated by contacting the mayor in victoria and offering him 1 ppcli s services to hand carry any congratulatory 
 0:con 0:gratulatory message he might wish to send to the mayor of calgary on the occasion of the calgary centennial 
 the idea and location of the start of this project was chosen because of the great physical challenge it offered 
 running across the rocky mountains and the patricias have never been ones to baulk at a physical challenge thus it 
 was that on 31 july 1975 mayor pollen of victoria formally presented a scroll bearing his congratulations to mayor sykes 
 on his city s centennial to pte bill koen to begin c company 1 ppcli s century calgary project although 
 the exercise was originally intended to run on a timetable 0:time 0:table gauged to arrive at heritage park on august 
 4th it was readily apparent that the timings would be thrown out the window when mayor pollen declared that he 
 would foot the bill for all the beer drunk by the team with the fastest fifteen mile leg from then 
 on the trip became mildly competitive as the timings became lower and lower the best time was finally recorded by 
 a team consisting of mcpl jim burgher cpl jerry hey re suds sutherland cpl jim blake and pte don cormier 
 they recorded their fifteen mile stretch in seventy eight minutes an average of 5 2 minutes per mile quite a 
 record well done finally on august 4th the message reached the gates of cfb calgary and when the clock was 
 stopped it was found that the 832 miles had been completed in 76 hrs and 54 minutes averaging 5 5 
 minutes per mile although the run was c company s project there was one team consisting of old vets from 
 the hq lcol crazy legs foster and the yips as they were called this was a very select team consisting 
 0:con 0:sisting of rsm stretch mcmillan the adjt capt lapper parent sgt rags roach and cpl swift swanson the culmination 
 of all this took place on august 4th on heritage day when pte neville pollard officially read and presented the 
 scroll to mayor sykes before some 25 000 people the response on arrival by the citizens of calgary made all 
 the sore feet and aching muscles worth the effort then after a few cool beers on the calgary mayor they 
 all departed for home and a well earned rest ex summer haze 75 ex summer haze 1975 a company sized 
 reciprocal training exchange 0:ex 0:change between the canadian and australian armies was conducted during the period 25 august to 5 
 october under the auspices of this program a complete rifle company formed from 1 ppcli and the canadian airborne regiment 
 served with the 6 bn royal australian 0:aust 0:ralian regiment and a company from 1 rar served with 1 ppcli 
 the princess patricia s canadian light airborne as were referred 0:refer 0:red to by 6 rar was equipped with the 
 standard australian infantry equipment and accepted as an integral part of the battalion almost immediately after arrival the company was 
 deployed to shoalwater bay a remote area in northeast queensland to participate in ex wundarra barmah despite our lack of 
 familiarity with the area everyone quickly settled down and performed well during the live fire portion of the exercise two 
 canadian platoons outscored by more than 300 hits their closest australian competitors on completion of the exercise our remaining two 
 weeks were spent in enoggerra brisbane touring the city and its environs as well as carrying out such military training 
 as was possible the jungle warfare centre in conungra was visited twice and the infamous confidence course will long be 
 remembered by everyone all in all it was a successful exchange and the aims of the program were met much 
 valuable training experience was gained and many friendships were made 
 15 grey cup grey cup 75 was a memorable event a 100 man guard commanded 0:com 0:manded by the dco 
 major don harris fired a salute to canada during the official pre game ceremonies this great occasion was also enhanced 
 by the fact that the guard and the regimental band received national tv coverage it was fitting that the ppcli 
 be part of the ceremonies in the first ever grey cup held in calgary ex rapier thrust iv ex rapier 
 thrust iv was conducted in the chilcotin area of british columbia during january 1976 the aim of the exercise was 
 twofold to practice the battalion in conventional operations under control of hq 1 cbt gp and secondly to prepare the 
 battalion for ex atlas express an amf l brigade level exercise to be held in the bardufoss area of northern 
 norway in march 76 the chilcotin area was chosen for the exercise because of the similarity of the terrain to 
 that of norway troops participating consisted of the ist bn ppcli a national support element of 1 svc bn j 
 bty 3 rcha and an engineer recce party from 3 fd sqn helicopters from 408 sqn completed the battalion group 
 rapier thrust iv closely followed the format for amf l brigade operations and evolved through the following phases the standby 
 phase the warning phase the deployment phase the deterrent phase the combat operations phase and the redeployment phase the standby 
 phase is the normal day to day state of the battalion and normal training and routine is conducted the warning 
 phase commences upon receipt of a warning order and at this time transportation 0:trans 0:portation arrangements are finalized and personnel 
 clearances are initiated the deployment phase involves the air move and this is commenced with the departure of the destination 
 airfield teams as soon as the first company or key company is complete on the ground it begins what is 
 known as the deterrent operations phase its purpose is to demonstrate nato presence and solidarity in the threatened area sometimes 
 these operations involve vehicle patrols roving many hundreds of miles if the deterrent phase deteriorates 0:de 0:teriorates into armed conflict 
 the combat operations is introduced rapier thrust iv re introduced many skills that the battalion had not practised in some 
 time the air move in particular required a great deal of work and the many lessons learned were put into 
 practice during atlas express rapier thrust iv presented the battalion group with a challenging 0:chal 0:lenging winter exercise and it 
 certainly assisted in preparing the battalion for ex atlas express ex atlas express ex atlas express was a nato exercise 
 conducted by the ace mobile force land brigade and was designed to test the deployment 0:deploy 0:ment and operation of 
 the various national contingents which make up the force as the canadian contribution to the amf l brigade the 1 
 ppcli battalion group was heavily committed to this exercise the valuable lessons learned in ex rapier thrust were employed 0:em 
 0:ployed resulting in an overall smoother operation cargo was more easily identified and the distribution and manifesting of equipment and 
 personnel was simplified it was discovered however that the greatly increased distances from rapier thrust iv seriously affected the airlift 
 in terms of aircraft serviceability and the movement schedule began to fall behind extra aircraft were inserted into the airflow 
 and the key company commenced deterrent operations within the prescribed time limit atlas express was by far the largest exercise 
 in which the battalion had participated in many years troops comprising the amf l brigade came from the uk west 
 germany italy the united states and norway enemy forces were provided by the norwegians and the royal marine commandos the 
 norwegian ski troops were a threat the patricias had not encountered before these troops were able to move quickly and 
 attempted to infiltrate our front and close our lines of communication to the rear upon completion of the exercise three 
 platoons from the battalion competed in the nato challenge cup an eight mile march and shoot competition 7 p 1 
 commanded by capt peter browne and ably assisted by sgt saumer finished ist in the bn and 3rd overall 1 
 ppcli battle school in the spring of 1976 the battalion held its own mini waincon in the form of a 
 battle school the aim was to practice section commanders 0:com 0:manders and riflemen in the performance of infantry skills while 
 under realistic combat conditions this battle school turned out to be one of the most worthwhile events of the training 
 year it consisted of a number of live fire exercises mainly at the section level including some of the phases 
 of war obstacle crossing and tank killing a platoon live fire exercise and a company advance to contact test exercise 
 completed the 10 day battle school enthusiasm for the school was evident throughout the training soldiers got down to the 
 finer points of soldiering and many of the lessons learned there will be carried with them for years to come 
 op gamescan 76 montreal was not only host to the world but also to 1 ppcli the major portion of 
 the battalion was given the opportunity of a lifetime 0:life 0:time by being chosen to be employed on security duties 
 during the xxi olympiad from the guarding of training sites to good ole a coy being on standby at the 
 olympic stadium the battalion upheld our fine regimental tradition the taskings were as diverse as they were challenging from the 
 heavy handed gungho operational exercise approach during training the new skills of tact diplomacy and approachability had to be taught 
 learned and refined the lads came through beautifully with only a few instances of feather ruffling the beauty of the 
 entire operation was that sub unit integrity was maintained and commanders 0:com 0:manders at all levels had complete control over 
 their men the taskings were not unlike the cyprus peacekeeping operation and our performance in montreal will hold us ready 
 for any similar requirements 0:re 0:quirements william hingston high school was our temporary home and a welcome change from the 
 slit trenches and sweltering heat of wainwright 0:wain 0:wright as always and in true patricia style it didn t take 
 long to wend our way into the hearts and minds of the neighbourhood the children soon learned the names of 
 many of the troops and if the excitement generated is any indication the recruit system had better gear up for 
 a substantial influx of young newcomers in 1985 high profile and the capability of instant reaction was the co s 
 game plan fortunately nothing went amiss and we hope that just through our presence we deterred any thought of disrupting 
 the games through violent action

 unit messes in the area we finished off in our own mess where the highlight of the evening was an 
 attempt by one elderly matron codename the cat lady to surmount the wheel despite heroic assistance from the subbies her 
 efforts proved futile winter battle school 1975 saw the continuance of the co s training policy stressing the maximum use 
 of live field firing exercises these exercises aroused the interest of all soldiers and kept training as realistic as possible 
 the first battle school was conducted in camp shilo during the latter part of january prior to commencement and while 
 a coy was setting up the school a major blizzard struck manitoba the unit was tasked to provide assistance both 
 in winnipeg and shilo apcs and ton trucks delivered food and medicine to people cut off by the storm in 
 winnipeg ton trucks were stationed at fire halls to deploy firemen and equipment in the event of fire fortunately no 
 emergencies occurred and after a few days things were back to normal 0:nor 0:mal and the battalion was on its 
 way to shilo the winter battle school stressed withdrawal and defence a coy successfully managed 0:man 0:aged to construct a

 mission was to recover a crashed fantasian satellite the patrol originally scheduled 0:sched 0:uled to land at isachsen on ellef 
 rignes island was forced to divert to resolute bay nwt due to poor weather conditions the flight to resolute took 
 seven hours from winnipeg and the troops were somewhat relieved when the aircraft finally set down a base camp was 
 established with the soldiers working in bright sunshine until someone discovered that it was really 0200 hrs in the morning 
 after a brief rest the company patrolled to the crash site covering 15 miles of rock and gravel the satellite 
 was destroyed after removing the memory bank and a company returned to resolute for further sub unit training the 0 
 temperatures and 40 mph winds made it comfortably cool as they used the open spaces north of resolute to conduct 
 live fire exercises during their spare time the troops fished for arctic char or walked about looking for souvenirs they 
 discovered 0:dis 0:covered fossilized insects and a venezuelan beer can lying in the middle of nowhere a number of fish 
 were caught and enjoyed as a vast improvement over hard rations for many in the company this was the first 
 trip to the arctic and destroyed a good deal of their misconceptions about the north 2 ppcli goes to jail

 morning when no incidents occurred 0:oc 0:curred the order was given to return to kapyong barracks camp minaki for the 
 first time that many of us remember the battalion had a good slice of leave and as a bonus it 
 came during the summer as people came back from leave however there was still a chance to get away from 
 the city an adventure training camp was set up in mid july for all ranks to get out of garrison 
 and do some navigation exercises and canoeing in both cases these were not arduous tasks but more in the line 
 of hiking and fishing trips each group of soldiers available spent one week in the camp area near minaki ontario 
 the camp was so successful that some of the soldiers asked to stay for a second week the diet consisted 
 of group kitchen meal packs hard rations and all the fish you could eat a number of the battalion brought 
 their families up on the weekends as the price was right the noise was nil and the fish plentiful shooting 
 this unit small arms team put on quite a show this summer at the annual 1 cbt gp small arms 
 competitions held in calgary practising for only one month prior to the competitions the team managed to win both the 
 rifle and pistol team awards led by the outstanding shooting of cpl r a woodward and cpl j c larocque

 top team their performance was very gratifying to team coach w o g n osborn who did a superb job 
 of getting the team ready for this important competition our pistol team performed equally well winning under the pressure of 
 close competition the team s only tyro pte e g weatherhall put in a good effort and shot very well

 climbing rapelling and rope bridging rarely is any training conducted without a confirmatory 0:confirma 0:tory test and the mountain school

 the exercise consisted of a five mile course through difficult terrain and included construction of a rope bridge climbing rock

 under realistic war time conditions in all aspects of conventional warfare the scope of the training encompassed a three phase 
 round robin style of training cycle consisting of dry training annual range qualifications and a live fire battle school during 
 the dry portion of training the sub units of the battalion practised the various phases of war using blank ammunition 
 prior to going on to the live fire battle school during the annual range qualification period each man fired his 
 own personal weapon and then qualified on support weapons the battle school portion of training was broken down into three 
 basic training activities a grenade assault course where soldiers acting 0:act 0:ing as scouts moved along a predetermined pathway using 
 hand grenades to destroy simulated enemy personnel a night vehicle ambush 0:am 0:bush where a platoon destroyed a group of

 alpha company led by major ron mcconnell played the bad guys for exercise rapier thrust iv in the chilcotins while

 of lord mountbatten of burma the father of lady patricia brabourne there were meetings of the regimental executive and the 
 ppcli association and a press conference for lady patricia brabourne and col stone in the better ole the gathering place 
 for all from the youngest soldier to the most seasoned patricia veterans the two hour performance of the kapyong 76 
 military tattoo in the winnipeg convention centre was an unparalleled success truly the highlight of the day the history of 
 the regiment poured out from the actors and bandsmen on the three stages as they portrayed it from formation in 
 1914 to the present day the spectators swelled with regimental pride as the lights dimmed and the last blue beret

 floor of the winnipeg convention centre which only a few hours before had been the stage on which our regimental

 possible the all ranks trooping dance arranged by capt ron johnson s committee was the breathing spell we had all 
 looked forward to and of which all ranks of all ages and their families took full advantage sunday came all 
 too soon lady patricia brabourne presented a stained glass window on behalf of the battalion in st andrew s chapel 
 and the church parade ended with three cheers for the colonel in chief which we think had originally been scheduled 
 for the end of the trooping of the colour parade but only the co knows for sure the departure of 
 lady patricia brabourne and lord mountbatten marked the official end of kapyong 76 the veterans departed and the soldiers of 
 2 ppcli went home full of pride and memories of their achievements time for reflection on kapyong 76 was short 
 for in less than a week the first of four airplanes departed for cyprus our united nations duty began officially 
 on 15 april as we took over sector four from lcol gregg leitch cd and his third battalion who left 
 us a well organized peacekeeping operation our summer on this eastern isle was militarily quiet so we had an opportunity 
 to address administrative details update orders and instructions 0:in 0:structions and improve accommodation and working areas we had an active 
 internal sports program including individual run and swim competition softball and volleyball leagues as well as participation in inter contingent 
 events such as tennis and swimming our most notable performance was in the unficyp small arms competition in which 2

 33 third battalion nineteen seventy five started out in a rather predictable manner for the third battalion once everyone had 
 returned from christmas leave and worked off the evils of the holiday spirit bags were packed for good old wainwright 
 and exercise refrigerator romp naturally the shock of the frozen expanses was somewhat greater to us than to the other 
 battalions who spent the better part of their time surrounded by the white stuff perhaps its the knowledge that the 
 cold will be short lived and we will soon be back home and warm in victoria that permits us to 
 accept this annual trial without undue anxiety as far as we in the third can determine 0:de 0:termine our once 
 a year frozen pilgrimage is all we need to keep our hand in at winter warfare and the consensus of 
 opinion is that once is quite enough of course some people are posted to victoria by accident and really do 
 like the freezing temperatures and icy climate of the north in order that they not be disappointed a company reinforced 
 by a platoon from d company volunteered to go north to alaska for an extra two weeks exercise jack frost 
 hosted by the american manchu regiment was their excuse and allowed both armies to get a glimpse of each other 
 s tactics and a chance to practice with one another s weapons needless to say there were also social obligations 
 0:ob 0:ligations and the chance to meet new friends trade war stories and acquire some foreign kit this of course 
 brightened up what otherwise might have been just another cold winter exercise during the month of february the battalion for 
 the most part managed to stay home in victoria this provided the time necessary to carry out some much needed 
 individual specialist training february 0:febru 0:ary also saw the graduation of our first recruit platoon from the operational training detachment 
 in wainwright scarpe platoon under lt dave arnott sgts butch daphinee and phil fields and mcpls hugh stevenson butch montreuil 
 and dave stiles became 6 platoon on their return to b company top candidate was pte don kirkland after a 
 company s heroics in alaska in february it was now bouncing bravo s turn to show its stuff accordingly march 
 brought with it exercise night raider a counter guerrilla exercise in the leechtown area the scenario found 5 and 6 
 platoons pitted against one another in a two sided battle for an exciting four days almost as important a factor 
 as the enemy was the terrain for as anyone who has spent any time on vancouver island can tell you 
 the bc rain forest is amongst the most formidable country you are ever likely to find anywhere our second platoon 
 of recruits also arrived in march mons platoon under lt frank parker wo jim campagna sgts karl grohs and arnie 
 day and mcpls doug cowles and bob tucker on their arrival they became 4 platoon b company top candidate was 
 pte mike boyling it would be amiss not to mention at this time our annual sports classic after a hard 
 fought year of inter company sports b company somehow managed to take the field winning all three sports flag football 
 ice hockey and floor hockey april was the month of our annual trek south of the border to take advantage 
 of the range facilities at fort lewis washington with a temporary support base set up by the logistics platoon each 
 of the rifle companies and all of the support weapons platoons each spent a week doing much needed range work 
 battle drills and field firing ex ercises all in all it was a successful effort with the battalion once again 
 amazing the americans by our ability to keep our aging vehicles operational april of course was also time for the 
 general waters competition however for us this year it was a 10 miler with a difference after doing the requisite 
 20 miles for the competition over 400 members of the battalion carried right on to complete a full 100 miles 
 as part of exercise island wanderer averaging 17 miles a day the march proved to be quite a test of 
 endurance for legs feet and boots alike the marchers were aided at several points along the route by the skirl 
 of the pipes as cpl angus grant the co s piper helped to shorten a few of the miles working 
 as hard as those marching but in a different way was the administrative support group under lt bob halpin and 
 mwo jim petty travelling ahead of the marchers this group ensured that everything was as comfortable as possible for them 
 at the end of each day s hump foot inspection foot baths running shoes good food a cool beer movie 
 and 777777777 until the next day s effort that was exercise island wandering and it was nothing short of great 
 to see a certain sergeant major at the end of the day s march saying just 300 metres to go 
 lads not all of the soldiers who took part in island wanderer marched the 100 miles 15 members of b 
 company competing in the cross canada run competition ran the entire distance led by sgt wayne oertel the team went 
 on to win the competition on the last day of the march the battalion was granted permission by the mayor 
 mr a g young to exercise its right of freedom of the municipality of esquimalt and completed the 100 miles 
 with drums beating colours flying and bayonets fixed after many blisters worn out boots and songs it was a happy 
 battalion that marched through the gate of work point barracks may arrived courting its usual pastime waincon this year however 
 rather than being quartered in the relative comfort of camp wainwright it was decided to revive the lost art of 
 bivouac routine although there were a few grumblings about the lack of shower and washing facilities it was soon clear 
 that with each sub unit tucked away into its own bivy area a new sense of company spirit and inter 
 company 0:in 0:ter 0:company rivalry began to develop arriving just in time to partake 0:par 0:take in this rivalry were 
 our next two recruit platoons sicily under lt bill sutherland sgts pete kolbe bill brown and bill crazier and mcpls 
 gary cook carmen crispe and don schaffel and leonforte 0:leon 0:forte under lt court stevens wo ed titus sgt don 
 hilchey and mcpls mike sikora and ray chenier top candidates of these two platoons were ptes hunor nemeth and lee 
 keeso although section drills and platoon battlecraft training looked much the same as in previous years exercise prairie fire was 
 decidedly different at least for third battalion this time we got to play enemy and it wasn t long before 
 red triangles and fantasian rank badges started to appear throughout the battalion fast moving and action packed prairie fire was 
 certainly a fitting end to the training year yet it was not the end of waincon there was exercise sabre 
 the battalion forced march and shooting competition which was won by 6 platoon under lt geoff baker and sgt pete 
 peterson then there was armour defence platoon under sgt bob timms who went on to win the 106 mm rr 
 competition and b company who captured the maw competition in the brigade meet one of a company s heavy machine 
 gun teams consisting of mcpls jim scott and doug westacott and ptes pete walsh and wally warrington was judged as 
 the best of the brigade 
 34 on return from wainwright in mid june the battalion took to the square to say farewell to the old 
 co and to welcome the new old man as normal the one change brought with it a host of others 
 as a new personality exerted itself swagger stick wedgies dogs in the mess what next june also saw the arrival 
 of our fifth group of recruits from the depot 0:de 0:pot as lt doug salmon sgt norm williams and mcpl 
 brian sheppard brought back 14 members of gully platoon for a company 0:com 0:pany just as the battalion was about 
 to proceed on summer leave the penitentiary guards decided that they should have a day off and walked out thus 
 followed operation cadence which saw the battalion guarding the federal penitentiaries in new westminster and william head what was amazing 
 about the operation was the visible change in the attitude of people when they know that something 0:some 0:thing is 
 for real as such genuine interest and keen effort was evident 0:evi 0:dent at every level particularly on the part 
 of battalion tactical hq in the matter of a certain gorgeous young prison official the autumn brought another series of 
 individual specialist courses to bring us up to scratch for the upcoming tour in cyprus also for the first time 
 in several years there was a combat leader course conducted by the unit the top candidate on this extremely tough 
 and demanding course was pte terry millman of signal platoon september saw the graduation of our last recruit platoon from 
 wainwright 0:wain 0:wright to bring us up to strength for cyprus rimini line under lt wiley kemp and mcpls len 
 rooney and wayne bolduc became 1 platoon of a company on their arrival as the courses went on so did 
 our preparations for cyprus classes were interrupted by the gigantic sausage machine needles warning orders passports briefings and so many 
 of the other evil necessities of going overseas were all handled one by one a mini sports programme was also 
 underway at the time with soccer being the highlight of events the battalion soccer cup was won by a newly 
 reconstituted charles company after a hard fought battle against bravo of course the biggest event of the year was third 
 battalion s un tour in cyprus from november 75 to april 76 that of course is a separate story which 
 you can read about at the end of this article and if you want the truth about our tour you 
 ll have to consult the ric a dam do our unit newspaper bound editions of the r d d as 
 well as plaques awol bags t shirts and numerous achievement certificates were just a few of the gifts accrued before 
 rotation home parting is such sweet sorrow and to emphasize this the battalion exercises its right to the freedom of 
 the city of victoria in a farewell parade on the grounds of the provincial legislature the ceremonies were well attended 
 and received good press coverage and it was encouraging 0:en 0:couraging to note that people really do care what we 
 do once back from cyprus it was straight off on 3 weeks leave as soon as your foot touched canadian 
 soil a welcome reward after 6 months away from hearth and home the break over the battalion officially reported back 
 to work and rear party was dismantled victoria welcomed us back as we again exercised our right of freedom 0:free 
 0:dom of the city and marched in the annual victoria day parade but then it was business as usual and 
 security for the un habitat conference 0:con 0:ference was next on our list is drills and anti terrorist tactics were 
 soon familiar sights around work point barracks along with the helicopters of 408 squadron just in time to join in 
 on the fun of is training were our first two post cyprus platoons from wainwright 18 members of ypres pla 
 toon under mcpl woody woodcock were first and they were soon joined by the 22 members of vimy platoon under 
 mcpls wayne bennett and jeff hislop pte gary greenoway was top candidate from ypres which was posted to a company 
 while pte duke cuthbert took the honours for vimy which joined b company fortunately habitat went off without a hitch 
 and everyone was able to breath a little easier of course we weren t so lucky for the 21st olympiad 
 and at 4 00 p m on sunday the 18th of july b company reinforced by a and hq flew 
 off to montreal on eight hours notice quartered with ist battalion and under command of the co 3r22r they not 
 only enjoyed their three week athlete security task but managed to take in a few events first hand then it 
 was back to normal unit training and support to various schools militia and cadet units across the country however everyone 
 did get two or more weeks leave during july and august which was much enjoyed it wasn t long before 
 our next platoon arrived ready to go from the depot in the form of 23 members of hill 70 platoon 
 under sgt redge gurr and mcpls brian anderson and tom scott the top candidate was pte mike cook all 23 
 new soldiers were quickly absorbed by a company and soon found themselves deeply involved in the company battle school being 
 run by lt doug salmon with wos joe danyleyko and tom battram sgts pete okopski al legood and dave delmage

 ace november 1975 marked the retirement of cpl ace mx and what you may ask is so significant about that 
 well ace manchu kijik was third battalion s mascot for 2 years the huge white malemute great pyrennes cross was 
 acquired by b company then under major jack english while on exercise ace card vi in alaska in february 1973 
 with the us 9th infantry regiment manchu ace was described by his owner mr gary marbut of college alaska as 
 the best pup he had ever raised and at 4 weeks he was twice the size of his brother and 
 sister since that time ace has grown from literally a handfull of white fur to nearly a 100 pounds of 
 playful spirited dog on any given day ace who had the complete run of work point barracks could be found 
 wandering through the company lines sleeping in the hallways of battalion headquarters or just running around getting in mischief and 
 mud puddles he was well known for his affection for civilians when the battalion fell in for parade ace marched 
 right along with them resplendant in his full dress blanket with regimental colours and insignia embossed on either side he 
 would often make melodic efforts to accompany the battalion piper much to the consternation of the rsm during his short 
 career ace managed to complete a special junior leader s course or as the civics call it an obedience course 
 receiving 0:re 0:ceiving a b grading and qualifying him to promotion to corporal sa cpl gord kitsch his handler was 
 often heard to mutter that soon the dog would outrank him ace became quite attached to many members of the 
 battalion especially to his handler in fact he is not only the battalion s mascot 0:mas 0:cot but also a 
 family pet to cpl kitsch s children thus the retirement 0:re 0:tirement of cpl kitsch from the regiment after many 
 years of dedicated 0:dedi 0:cated service also marked the retirement of cpl ace fortunately though by special arrangement the battalion 
 has managed to retain him as mascot for special occasions thus ace comes out of retirement 0:retire 0:ment to march

 took to running as well as a little hard soldiering and as armoured defence too 
 47 occupied a lot of our time and effort too as did our farms 
 48 the intercommunal talks and some didn t want to leave we eventually departed knowing we had done our job 
 well and that unficyp would not soon forget the third patricias 
 49 gagetown patricia s the first sightings were reported just east of vancouver in august of 1975 as august gradually 
 turned to september the sightings not only became more frequent but they were also reported in the areas of calgary 
 and winnipeg the early reports were of curious little scratches in the surface of the trans canada highway but as 
 time went on it appeared that these scratches were turning into deep gouges investigations revealed that these marks were caused 
 by patricias and their families who were being dragged kicking and screaming from their beloved army of the west to 
 serve in cfb gagetown the fall period of 1975 saw an unusually large number of patricias posted to cfb gagetown 
 and for most of us it was a pretty traumatic experience for many it was the first posting away from 
 a battalion and meant leaving familiar surroundings and friendships developed over many years of working together we were leaving that 
 feeling of well being that comes from knowing who to see or where to go to get things done the 
 thought of having to completely re establish ourselves was more than a little disconcerting cfb gagetown and the combat arms 
 school were not totally unfamiliar 0:un 0:familiar to us at one time or another we had all been there on 
 one course or another we all had some pretty clear memories of boring evenings spent in quarters the frustrations of 
 shopping moosehead 0:moose 0:head hangovers etc but perhaps strongest of all were the memories of those self centred unsympathetic self 
 appointed experts on everything who served as instructors perhaps this was the largest pill to swallow the thought that we 
 were about to become one of them it wasn t until the meet and greet cocktail party held in early 
 november and hosted by mwo jack murray in the brownfield wo and sgts mess that we realized just how foolish 
 a great many of our worries were it was really quite astounding to discover how many patricias and old friends 
 had made the trip before us any misapprehensions 0:mis 0:apprehensions we may have had about becoming one of them were 
 quickly replaced by a genuine desire to uphold and strengthen the fine reputation that our fellow patricias had developed in 
 their respective 0:re 0:spective fields of endeavour it would be most difficult to find a more dedicated group of professionals 
 anywhere for most of us it was an honour to be invited to play on the same team patricias were 
 to be found in every facet of the base operation at the helm of course was bgen e m k 
 macgregor mc cd commander of the combat training centre a distinguished soldier and a truly fine representative of the regiment

 somehow bill stutt performed the very necessary but thankless task of writing training manuals as a member of the fmc

 however were to be found within infantry department and involved in the actual execution of the courses run by the 
 department think of a course any course run by the department and you could find a patricia involved with it

 the dsmi new arrivals were quick to learn that unlike the remainder of the maritimes the pace around gagetown can 
 never be considered dull or boring after a brief orientation course most of us took up our new appointments and 
 plunged headlong into a hectic course schedule that succeeded in keeping us very busy until the most welcome christmas break 
 the new year saw us begin the course cycle once again with january and february spent preparing for numerous courses 
 commencing in march from the point of view of workload our regimental day could hardly fall at a worse time 
 somehow however time was found to celebrate the event in true regimental fashion on 16 march all gagetown 0:gage 0:town 
 patricias gathered for a preliminary blood letting with bgen macgregor leading the way the 17 march saw the worst snow 
 storm to hit the maritimes all winter so severe was the storm that it was necessary to call a complete 
 standdown on the base despite the storm one entire group did report in as scheduled this group was of course 
 the entire complement of patricias serving in gagetown why to play broom a loo of course the outcome of the 
 traditional officers ys sergeants game was most surprising the ncos managed to squeak a narrow victory in spite of the 
 fact that the officers had availed themselves 0:them 0:selves of the service of an additional 14 stars who just happened 
 to be ppcli officers attending the company commander s course in retrospect however the outcome was a foregone conclusion doc 
 the seive miles tended goal for the officers and his loyalties are still somewhat debatable numerous firsts of another nature 
 have been achieved by lcol g d hunt in the past year lcol hunt who has long been renowned throughout 
 the regiment for his athletic prowess has added an impressive 0:im 0:pressive array of accomplishments to his most enviable record 
 in track and field in august 1975 as a member of the canadian team in the world masters championship he 
 placed third in the 4 x 400 m relay event to be eligible for competition in the masters category competitors 
 must be over 40 years of age on 15 february 76 whilst participating in the ontario masters indoor championship he 
 placed first in the 50m event during which he tied his own canadian record in the same meet he placed 
 first in the 200 m event setting a new ontario indoor record lcol hunt s participation is by no means 
 re 
 50 stricted to the over 40 category in fact in open class competition i e 18 years of age and 
 over he continued to add to his accomplishments 0:accomplish 0:ments on 12 june 76 in the oromocto open meet he 
 placed first in the 200 m event on 15 june 76 during an open meet sponsored by hq ctc he 
 made a clean sweep securing first in the 100 200 and 400 m events although our brothers in the airborne 
 regiment don t care to admit it they are not the only active parachutists in canada the combat arms school 
 has been able to retain a continuation parachuting 0:para 0:chuting role with a large number of participants found from within 
 infantry department the regiment has once again been well re presented within this group col cowling as the senior parachutist 
 has ensured that these stalwarts have hurled their frail frames out of anything that flies whenever the opportunity presented itself 
 at the time of writing reports have started to trickle in that these scratches are starting to appear again on 
 the trans canada highway it should also be noted that there are an equal number of strips of rubber being 
 laid by those who have received their postings out west to those that are leaving we wish good luck to 
 them and their families they should leave knowing that those of us who are staying consider it a distinct privilege 
 to have been associated with them to those who are about to arrive we say calm your fears you will 
 find your new appointment in gagetown a demanding yet very rewarding experience there are a great many patricias here who 
 look forward to renewing old friendships the regimental spirit remains strong in gagetown and continues to thrive it will do 
 so just as surely as the pope remains catholic and the sun continues to set over shannon coulee although the 
 storm was unable to dampen the spirit of the males in deference to their ladies the formal dinner planned for 
 the evening of the 17 march was postponed until the following night as a result of a considerable amount of 
 planning and hardwork by wo jim glendinning 0:glen 0:dinning and bill miller the evening was a tremendous success with all 
 those attending enjoying a delicious meal served in a warm family atmosphere two most welcome guests who shared the festivities 
 with us were maj bill minnis cflo fort benning and maj alex morrison fmc hq both of whom were able 
 to arrange visits to the combat arms school that just happened to coincide with our celebrations of the regimental day 
 with the 17 march behind us it was once again back to the courses and a schedule that saw the 
 instructional staff totally committed until the end of august the opportunities to gather as a group were obviously limited but 
 seized whenever possible a most welcome visit by mgen g g brown on 13 july provided the next opportunity to 
 gather on this occasion regimental officers assembled for cocktails following a short ceremony during which hat badges were presented by 
 mgen brown to newly commissioned officers joining the regiment this gesture performed by such a distinguished 0:dis 0:tinguished member of 
 the regiment is an honour that they will obviously cherish for years to come the regiment has long prided itself 
 on regimental firsts in the past year gagetown patricias have been able to add to that already impressive 0:im 0:pressive 
 record 1976 saw wo glendinning an armoured defence instructor with this department qualify as the first canadian nco to qualify 
 as a tow instructor on a course conducted at the us army infantry centre in fort benning georgia during a 
 weapons effects demonstration conducted during july 76 for the benefit of all officer cadets undergoing training at the combat arms 
 school he fired the first live tow missile in canada needless to say all were suitably impressed when he achieved 
 a first round hit against a tank target at a range of approximately 3000 metres group photo gagetown patricias wo

 51 regimental band since re forming in 1952 the band has been in virtually all of the countries in which 
 the canadian forces have had troops the band went to japan and korea during the hostilities there and spent several 
 months entertaining canadian and united nations troops in the 25th brigade area on their return from the far east the 
 band settled down to several years of garrison duty in calgary their next posting was an extended tour of duty 
 with the 27th brigade in westphalia for this tour and as far as i know it is the only one 
 the bandsmen were accompanied by their families for the entire period while in germany the band represented canada and the 
 canadian forces in the nato countries throughout europe tbey also travelled to north africa during this tour to entertain the 
 canadian troops on duty in egypt following their tour in europe the band was posted to edmonton for several years 
 during this time they toured alberta and the northwest 0:north 0:west territories extensively as well as several tours of the 
 united states including a very memorable trip to california as guests of the united states marine corps while staying at 
 the u s m c air base at el toro the band led a parade through disneyland in celebration of 
 mickey mouse s 40th birthday a real mickey mouse parade after that parade they moved up into the high desert 
 east of los angeles to the base at 29 palms here they took part in a tattoo which is still 
 remembered and talked about by the marine corps personnel who saw the show the band also took part in canada 
 s centennial celebrations which saw members of the band travelling across canada from coast to coast four times and being 
 on the road for up to eight months since 1969 the band has been to europe and cyprus on five 
 tours of duty and has represented canada in such things as the nynmegen four days march and the nato tattoo 
 at kaiserslautern while participating with bands of other nato nations some of which were able to put 150 men on 
 parade the ppcli band was the only band present to receive a standing ovation the band probably had its largest 
 audience ever when it took part in the rose bowl parade in pasadena california last new years day the parade 
 which stretches for eight miles was rather hard on some of our members who had celebrated new year s eve 
 it was seen by an estimated 11 million people along the parade route and several hundred million people who watched 
 it on television all over the world after the rose bowl parade the band moved north to san francisco to 
 play the half time show for the annual shrine east west all star game the band returned from california in 
 january and immediately began 0:be 0:gan preparation for a tour of duty with the 3rd bn ppcli in cyprus everyone 
 was looking forward to the sunny mediterranean in february we arrived there and had the dubious distinction of playing a 
 concert for the turkish army who were unable to attend because 0:be 0:cause of a heavy snowfall preventing their vehicles 
 from getting through to the concert hall it could only happen to a band from alberta we moved to calgary 
 in 1968 and amalgamated with the lord strathcona s horse rc band in currie barracks this gave the band a 
 strength of 74 and made it one of the largest bands in the canadian forces since that time changes in 
 band policy and structure has reduced the band to its present strength of 33 this week we say our farewells 
 to wo doug russell who is posted to the canadian forces school of music in esquimau on a one year 
 s course doug is rather unique in the canadian forces in that he enlisted 0:en 0:listed in the ppcli band 
 in 1952 and has served his entire career in this band only two other people i know of have done 
 that they are wo bill smith and sgt al irwin both of whom recently retired these three men formed what 
 was virtually our last link with the band as it was in the old days of the korean era an 
 interesting vignette involving these three men is that they all served in korea during the fighting there they served the 
 required period of time and were granted the medals for it a few years later when they applied for benefits 
 under the veterans land act they were told that on paper the unit had never left canada a member of 
 parliament went to bat for them and was told that to enable them to get v l a benefits the 
 army would have to change the order of battle for the canadian army and that would be too expensive an 
 interesting legal problem could have arisen if one of them had been killed over there to parody a popular song 
 that cra is breaking up that old gang of mine in the first half of this year we have lost 
 twelve good men to postings and release struck off strength have been cwo peter murray mwo nick devries wo cal 
 muirhead wo doug russell wo don singlehurst sgt bill belenky sgt al irwin sgt art maier sgt terry slymon sgt 
 marty vander weerd and cpl con marra this group of men all of whom were very important and critical members 
 of the ppcli band represent more than 25 percent 0:per 0:cent of the unit i could sit here for hours 
 recounting anecdotes about all of these men they were all characters of one sort and another within the band and 
 they are sorely missed both as personalities and as first class musicians we will probably not see their like again 
 they represent almost three centuries of service these are the kind of people who cannot be replaced overnight we bring 
 this segment of the band news to a close now the band is now on annual leave with its members 
 scattered over two continents hopefully we will see them all in september

 by a visit by hm the queen our colonel in chief the ist battalion who are stationed at connaught barracks 
 dover were chosen to act as hosts on behalf of the regiment although arrangements were made to ensure that individuals 
 from all battalions and the rifle depot took part in the programme met the colonel in chief and lunched with 
 her the programme for the colonel in chief included a guard of honour on arrival this was followed by a 
 tattoo with a spoken and musical commentary illustrating the history of the royal green jackets and the predecessor regiments from 
 whom the royal green jackets are descended tableaux included scenes depicting the wars in north america in the late 18th 
 century sir john moore at shorncliffe the kashmir gate at delhi the boer war the ist world war calais 1940 
 indonesia 1964 65 and northern ireland a party from the 2nd 2nd ghurkas took part in the tableau relating to 
 the kashmir gate after the tattoo her majesty lunched with a mixed party of regimental 0:regi 0:mental representatives made up 
 from all ranks from colonels commandant to riflemen accompanied by their wives after lunch the colonel in chief visited the 
 warrant officers and sergeants mess and saw a static display by the 4th volunteer battalion the visit ended with a 
 walk about during which her majesty met many junior ranks and their families the visit was a most successful and 
 happy family occasion the tattoo and the mixed lunch for all ranks and their wives were novations 0:no 0:vations which 
 made their special mark on the occasion the programme 0:pro 0:gramme was directed towards the maximum number of junior ranks 
 and their families being able to meet the colonel in chief personally all our allied and affiliated regiments were invited 
 to be represented on this occasion and the regiment entertained a limited number of yip guests former members of the 
 regiment were welcomed as spectators news from the battalions and the rifle depot the ist battalion were in northern ireland 
 from the end of the year until april 75 they had a very active tour and the so called cease 
 fire was more evident in the english newspapers than it was in northern ireland on return to their permanent station 
 at dover b company left for guyana for five weeks jungle training c company spent three weeks in denmark and 
 a company of danish life guards spent an exchange visit in dover with the rest of the battalion july saw 
 the battalion acting as hosts for the regiment to the colonel in chief this great event is described in detail 
 at the beginning 0:be 0:ginning of these notes periods on duty as spearhead and leave followed and now the battalion 
 0:bat 0:talion is preparing for a tour of public duties in london which will include mounting the guard at buckingham 
 palace a varied year the 2nd battalion also start their news with a tour in northern ireland from november 74 
 to february 75 they also had an active tour and at least their share of incidents and successes of comedy 
 and near and actual tragedy although fortunately no fatal casualties 0:casual 0:ties were incurred after the battalion s return to 
 catterick there was a period of block leave spearhead once again followed by preparations for the scheduled 0:sched 0:uled move 
 to gibraltar the battalion moved in july and entered a new world of social activity ceremonial making faces at spanish 
 guards and apes and sweet white wine if no peacocks all this offers a pleasant change and the only real 
 snag at present is a shortage 0:short 0:age of married quarters the 3rd battalion left northern ireland at the end 
 of october 1974 and immediately prepared for the move to berlin which was completed 0:com 0:pleted in early 1975 the 
 battalion occupies wavell barracks 
 56 routine in berlin revolves around ceremonial duties practises of general stand to some rather restricted training and social and 
 sporting activities the battalion has had considerable success in shooting cricket and boxing twice a year battalions in berlin leave 
 the city for training in other parts of germany in july the 3rd battalion went to soltau and sennelager for 
 sub unit training in september a very interesting exercise took place involving an amphibious assault landing from a german navy 
 task force followed by a dunkirk type withdrawal across the beaches supported by helicopters and fighter aircraft the exercise ended 
 with the battalion being flown back to berlin as a practice for reinforcement of the city under emergency conditions the 
 4th volunteer battalion the year 1975 has been one of growth for the 4th battalion who have taken over two 
 more drill halls enabling the battalion to expand and reorganize there is now a new company g in london and 
 an airportable company at aylesbury and bletchley events during the year have included field firing on salisbury plain the t 
 ayr parade in hyde park before her majesty the queen mother and a very successful entry in the london and 
 south east district rifle meeting culminating in the battalion achieving the title of major unit champions success at bisley included 
 winning the tet ayr jubilee cup and home guard cup annual camp was held at otterburn and the battalion took 
 part in a nation wide mobilization exercise in october the rifle depot has also had a hectic 1975 the junior 
 riflemen s 0:rifle 0:men 0:s shooting team all but swept the board at the small arms meeting 0:meet 0:ing in 
 south east district and bisley the depot basket ball team won the minor unit championship and defeated the winners of 
 the major units competition unemployment in civilian life has led to a 50 rise in the intake of junior riflemen 
 a welcome boost to recruiting a visit to canada general sir antony read in april 1975 i went to canada 
 wearing my hat as chairman of the army cadet force association to speak at the annual conference of the canadian 
 army cadet league in ottawa they were prepared to fly me over by service aircraft with great kindness they asked 
 me if there was anywhere else i would like to visit whilst i had been in canada several times before 
 i had never been to the west coast and so with some trepidation i suggested i should go there and 
 visit the battalion of princess patricia s canadian light infantry that was stationed in those parts to my great delight 
 this worked gen cammy ware colonel of the patricias did his stuff and made official the invitation to visit the 
 affiliated regiment so when i arrived in ottawa i found the whole royal green jacket affiliated net had been alerted 
 i did do a lot of cadet business in canada but that i have written about for cadets this brief 
 contribution is to exemplify the strength of the regimental affiliations how much it means to the canadians and to us 
 and how we must never let these invisible bonds weaken despite the machinations of politicians on both sides of the 
 atlantic my canadian cadet contact met me on my arrival in ottawa and handed me a brief which showed that 
 he had done a great deal of research on r g j affiliations he had planned for me to meet 
 representatives of every regiment but he was having trouble with the queen s own rifles due to distance and other 
 engagements but he had fixed for a colonel still serving in toronto to come up for dinner that night he 
 had made arrangements for r g j contacts throughout my trip and so it turned out en route for vancouver 
 we stopped to refuel at the canadian forces airport at winnipeg where the 2nd battalion of the patricias is stationed 
 i had been sitting in the aircraft next to the director of the canadian forces dental service as we taxied 
 to the administrative building he said to me stick close to me because i think i know where we can 
 get a drink here i replied that i thought that he would do better if he stuck close to me 
 because the patricias were in winnipeg and i was pretty sure we would be looked after and sure enough as 
 we went down the steps there was bob stewart and his second in command from the patricias to meet me 
 and lead me and the head dentist straight to the bar in vancouver i stayed with ted eakins who had 
 served in italy in douglas darling s battalion of the rifle brigade we went to victoria and in company with 
 cammy ware who lives there drove out to see and have lunch with the 3rd battalion of the patricias who 
 were on an exercise we lunched in the field silver candelabra on the table and one of the company commanders 
 tucking into an excellent meal said to me i am glad you have come otherwise i should have been eating 
 a boloney sandwich in a ditch the following night ted eakins took me on drill night in vancouver with the 
 british columbia regiment where i met all the officers and members of the sergeants mess i then flew to calgary 
 and spent two nights with the ist battalion of the patricias with whom lance ruck keene is serving as exchange 
 officer we had a memorable dinner party in their mess with all wives present and a big reception the following 
 night with gen bill howard a prominent alberta lawyer and a great figure in the cadet world sadly the honorary 
 colonel of the regina rifles was prevented from coming and they were the only regiment i did not contact ihope 
 this is an accurate statement but i met so many people in such a short time that my memory has 
 become a little blurred refuelling again at winnipeg on my way west the next day i found my way to 
 the bar unaided but as i went in i was met by scott who commands the royal winnipeg rifles who 
 proceeded to look after me in a rifleman like manner two nights later in ottawa senator guy motgat honorary colonel 
 of the winnipeg rifles gave a sumptuous dinner party and there among his guests were the honorary colonel and the 
 honorary lieut colonel of the brockville rifles it was a great experience and of course what stands out in one 
 s mind is the distance these kind people were prepared to travel and the trouble they were prepared to take 
 to make a regimental contact with me it demonstrated most forcibly to me once again the great strength of these 
 regimental ties and how much it is to everybody s advantage to do all we can to make them stronger 
 and how we must defy any efforts that may be made to weaken them as a poor thank you when 
 i left i sent the following signal to the honorary colonels of all the affiliated regiments personal from gen sir 
 antony read in my short trip to canada i have made contact with nearly all royal green jacket affiliated regiments 
 it has been a great experience and pleasure for me to meet so many friends reinforce the royal green jacket 
 family ties and to find that the regimental hearts are beating more strongly than ever good fortune to you all 
 and thank you all for your many kindnesses to me 
 57 princess patricia s canadian light infantry association patron the lady patricia brabourne dl jp cd vice patron brigadier general 
 ja de lalanne cbe mc ostj ed ba ca lieutenant colonel jh carvasso mc president s report it has been 
 my honour and privilege to have served as your president 0:presi 0:dent since august of 1974 a total period of 
 one year and seven months this of course came about because there was no annual general meeting in 1975 the 
 decision not to hold a meeting was based on the fact that only 19 months were to separate the 1974 
 and 1976 meetings your general committee met in victoria in august of 1975 the results of that meeting were embodied 
 in the minutes which were read by the secretary treasurer a few minutes ago one of our most pressing problems 
 concerns the patrician and its continuing loss of readers this of course causes a strain on the means of financing 
 the publication and the inevitability of its final demise there is a need for some action to be taken now 
 to prevent the loss of the patrician this association at its annual general meetings has continuously voiced its support for 
 the annual journal it is recorded in the minutes of quite a number of meetings that the members were deeply 
 concerned 0:con 0:cerned that the patrician was in financial difficulty and because of this may have to cease publication however 
 five of our ten branches have seen fit to drop the annual journal from their membership 0:member 0:ship dues on 
 talking to some of these members i find that the biggest complaint is the lack of material that is of 
 interest to world war i and ii veterans the regimental executive committee has subjected the journal to an in depth 
 study and will be making a proposal to us later in this meeting later in the meeting you will be 
 introduced to the results of a ways and means sub committee which met in ottawa last december this meeting chaired 
 by general de lalanne consisted of two association members and two officers from the serving battalions our secretary 0:secre 0:tary 
 treasurer was the recording secretary for this sub committee again much thought and effort went into this meeting and some 
 far reaching proposals will be placed before you for your consideration 0:considera 0:tion finally you will be requested to consider 
 a further enlargement of the hamilton gault memorial fund a subsidiary resolution has been attached to the fund which embodies 
 the korean student bursary account now we wish to attach a second subsidiary resolution to create a museum committee and 
 a museum account you will realize later the financial benefit that can be derived from contributing 0:contribut 0:ing to this 
 account this then is the summary of the business before us the details of which will unfold as we proceed 
 through the agenda i would like to extend my personal thanks and the thanks of all members 0:mem 0:bers of 
 the association to colonel and mrs stone for representing the regiment at the dedication and unveiling of a canadian memorial 
 at kapyong korea there are a great many of us here today who will wish that they could have been 
 present on the 7th of november 1975 however no one could better represent us than the commanding 0:command 0:ing officer 
 at kapyong big jim stone and his charming wife there are no adequate words to express our thanks to all 
 ranks of second battalion for their performance during this historic and memorable week end due honor is being paid to 
 the veterans of kapyong due respect is being paid to the memory of those who paid the supreme sacrifice at 
 kapyong we have been afforded the opportunity to hold this meeting and a re union of all patricias we have 
 witnessed a flawless military tattoo and undoubtedly will see just as flawless a trooping ceremony this afternoon what more can 
 be said through colonel stewart we extend a monstrous thanks for the tremendous efforts that have gone into kapyong 76 
 in closing i must say my one and only regret of this entire weekend 0:week 0:end is that one of 
 canada s finest soldiers our colonel of the regiment 0:regi 0:ment general ware through health reasons is unable to be 
 with us however i m sure that cammy s thoughts are with us i think it only proper that an 
 appropriate letter be sent to general ware from this meeting note the above report was presented by mr e j 
 dodd cd at the general meeting held at kapyong barracks winnipeg 26 march 1976 
 58 toronto branch 1975 was another quiet year for the toronto branch i think you have covered most of our 
 activities by printing extracts from the occasional toronto branch news letters in the regimental newsletters 0:newslet 0:ters the only item 
 not mentioned was the annual dinner this was arranged by col phil roy and was held in the canadian forces 
 staff college officers mess i am sure that everyone enjoyed themselves we had a fabulous dinner of course the number 
 attending was not large but this made it all the more intimate and conducive to friendly banter and spinning yarns 
 we had a very interesting talk from major barry winfield on the regiment in the regular force several patricias attending 
 staff college were with us so there was a good mixture of ist 2nd ww and regular force people and 
 all were keenly interested in each others exploits it was felt that each one could identify with the other and 
 with the group so that in the end we were all just patricias and were with dave pearce when he 
 tried to buy woofs eggs in courcellette and ended up with the whole chicken in paris on leave in 1917 
 with pat patterson struggling up a mountain side in southern italy to reach a cantina with red fulton and serving 
 with the peace keeping forces or adventure training exercises with the regular force most of the credit must go to 
 col roy who not only ensured an ample supply of good wines but by his own friendly nature that is 
 so relaxed 0:re 0:laxed and relaxing as red fulton a crusty vet of wwii vintage who lost a leg and 
 an eye in italy remarked with officers like wingate winfield the regiment is in pretty good hands that was the 
 last get together we had in 1975 although we attempted 0:at 0:tempted to organize on several occasions mail strikes and 
 lack of response curtailed our activities we will be having an annual dinner this may bth and the outcome of 
 that will give us a pretty good idea of our future i am sorry for the delay in submitting this 
 knowing that it is well past your dead line i know that your other sources are much more productive and 
 interesting and this is reflected in the finished product your news letters and the patrician please convey greetings and sincere 
 best wishes from toronto to all patricias everywhere and especially to those still serving executive president ist vice president harold 
 s reading 2nd vice president charles l scot brown secretary treasurer john 0 clarke auditor victor f gianelli edmonton branch 
 our membership voted to hold two meetings a year the annual meeting on the 17th march and the last tuesday 
 in october to arrange for remembrance day activities in addition a special meeting will be called at the request of 
 the membership at the 17th march meeting the following were elected wally mills president paul robison vice president dane la
