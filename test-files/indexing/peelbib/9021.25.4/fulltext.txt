 gospeller superintendent of all people s mission in winnipeg and an early exponent of assirni lation undertook a study into
 immigration and its social response published in 1909 his book strangers within our gates serves as a basis for an
 examination of but one canadian response to the immigrant this reaction can only be defined as a eugenics program for
 it promoted a policy of outright segregation and the suggestion of a sterilization program much like his counterparts woodsworth accepted
 the notion that the post 1880 immigrant was by definition inferior in his analysis about 1882 a remarkable change took
 place in the character of immigration southern europe had been tapped and the stream came with a rush the early
 immigrants were more independent and individualistic while to day 1909 1 our immigrants or their friends pay a few pounds
 passage money and in a week or so are safely transported to a land with institutions similar to their own

 the physical influx of immigrants had obviously led and mental superiority of the anglo saxon woodsworth and others to be
