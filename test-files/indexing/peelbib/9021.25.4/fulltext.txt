 gospeller superintendent of all people s mission in winnipeg and an early exponent of assirni lation undertook a study into
 immigration and its social response published in 1909 his book strangers within our gates serves as a basis for an
 examination of but one canadian response to the immigrant this reaction can only be defined as a eugenics program for
 it promoted a policy of outright segregation and the suggestion of a sterilization program much like his counterparts woodsworth accepted
 the notion that the post 1880 immigrant was by definition inferior in his analysis about 1882 a remarkable change took
 place in the character of immigration southern europe had been tapped and the stream came with a rush the early
 immigrants were more independent and individualistic while to day 1909 1 our immigrants or their friends pay a few pounds
 passage money and in a week or so are safely transported to a land with institutions similar to their own

 can guess assimilation was somewhat lowered but at the resultant product 2 the massive given the belief of many in
 the physical influx of immigrants had obviously led and mental superiority of the anglo saxon woodsworth and others to be
 fearful of the race it was impossible to promote assimi answers lation and intermarriage with the lesser while the west
