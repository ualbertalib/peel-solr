 prowse and the alberta liberals by mew serfaty when world war two ended in 1945 the liberal party of alberta
 was in shambles there was no properly constituted provincial organization no leader no constituency strength and no morale remaining within
 its ranks the party like the independents and conservatives had dissipated its strength for an entire decade fighting both internal
 and external forces in search of an identity finally an overwhelming force had driven it to become allied with the
 unity movement in an effort to defeat the social credit when the liberals decided to break with the unity movement
 in december 1945 and reenter the provincial scene the mood was one of cautious optimism 2 the liberals were still
 regarded by many as the most qualified party to provide effective opposition to social credit on the other hand the
 obstacles facing the party seemed insurmountable what little organization there was existed in long held bastions of liberalism these included
 parts of edmonton and to a lesser extent calgary st albert grouard and some northern areas more important the organization
 in these areas centred around the federal mps and their organizations moreover to a large extent even these organ harper
 prowse at the time of the leadership convention in edmonton in 1947 by 1942 the organization had formally ceased to
 exist thus when a meeting of interested liberals was called in november 1945 at red deer only some 70 staunch
 supporters attended the two alberta mps james a mc kinn n and j m deschene were particularly persuasive in convincing
 the membership that the fortunes of the liberals federally would be enhanced if the party fought provincial elections as well
 consequently the meeting overwhelmingly decided to re enter the provincial arena it also unanimously agreed to establish a temporary dr

 movement in alberta was published in alberta histornal renew spring 973 izations ceased to exist between elections they seldom held
 meetings and only during elections did the machines spring back to life earlier at the 1937 convention the liberals had
 decided to combine the provincial and federal wings of the organization this had been done with the hope that the
 two would work with greater unity ‘ of purpose in effect all it had accomplished was to confirm an already
 well established fact federal politicians and a federallyoriented executive who had previously controlled the organization 4 were to increase their
 hold to the extent of strangling any opportunities for a provincial revival executive body and to appoint wes stambaugh free
 to criticize social credit as well as the other to the position of president a farmer business parties which in
 the early years included the man and a brilliant organizer stambaugh was federal liberals perhaps better equipped for the position
 than after the war ended prowse had come to the most as a contemporary liberal recorder put it realization that
 if he planned to continue in poli he spoke the language of the people in the tics he would have
 to ally himself with an estabsmall towns and on the farms 5 lished political party 9 he despised social credit
 the task ahead was arduous for the liberal and was therefore receptive when stambaugh banner seemed beyond repair stambaugh at
 offered him the opportunity to obtain the highest first single handedly set out to revive the party position in the
 alberta liberal party in a single throughout the province he did this by availing bound because of his qualifications and
 winning himself of lists of names of former liberals from personality he was also the unanimous choice of old records
 and hoping to find these people still the party hierarchy alive and prepared to become active as helen a leadership

 from grouard attached to the canadian succeeded in rekindling old sparks of liberal embassy in paris and harper prowse although
 support in towns throughout alberta he found tremblay had allowed his name to stand his however that liberal backers were
 sceptical position abroad made him an unlikely contender about becoming completely involved in the task wheattey on the other hand
 was quite popular of establishing a new organization at a time when with some of the farming communities howno leader
 had been elected and no proper structure ever despite any opposition prowse was able to for the party had been
 established by early 1947 defeat his two opponents by a clear majority in stambaugh was convinced that their demands had
 only one ballot to be heeded if the party was to become fully the convention was attended by delegates operative
 representing all but two of the provincial constit his chief task consisted of finding a new uencies in most of
 these constituencies only a leader the first since gray s resignation in 1940 modicum of support existed and no formal
 or the temporary executive gave him complete ganization had yet been established prowse freedom in his search for a suitable
 candidate towed that his work during the initial years among a party that had not elected any mla s would
 consist of building the liberal party of since 1935 and counted less than 500 members alberta from the grass roots
 the chief principle most of these liberals were rooted in their own to which he promised adherence was that of
 communities and were largely unknown else allowing each constituency complete autonomy where 8 ‘‘ to carry out the work in
 the manner best suited as early as 1946 stambaugh considered to its particular area while permitting this harper prowse to
 be his best candidate for leader basic freedom to develop prowse set as a high ship prowse was an independent

 the province his job would consist of mainfirst elected as a member of the legislative as taming a communications link
 between the provsembly as an army representative in 1944 a incial office and individual constituencies on former newsman his grasp
 of facts as well as his the one hand and to spread the message of excellent and forceful oratory made
 him the most liberalism throughout the province 2 on the attractive opposition member in the alberta other it was a
 year before prowse could appoint assembly as an independent member he felt james connors as a parttime organizer and 1950

 to the people were not looking or working to win the work but working as a team both attempted to
 election but to form the opposition organize each constituency and local community this criticism was to become commonplace durin the
 province ing his tenure of office the next provincial election was announced prowse was disappointed with his first liberal for
 1948 so after his assumption to the leadership election campaign although the party put up 32 role prowse turned toward
 the immediate goal candidates they were able to return only two of fighting that campaign to this end he sent
 a members the calibre of the candidates had been circular to the leaders of constituencies warning generally high but prowse
 blamed the constitthem that in order to succeed as a political uencies for not living up to their responsibilities organization
 a three pronged thrust was neces they had failed both to organize within their dissary to build an ‘‘ efficient
 enthusiastic and tricts and to suggest issues of interest to their active constituence to find the best man in constituencies
 he maintained that many liberaleach constituency to run under our banner and minded people had chosen to vote for social
 to draw up a sound sensible platftwm which credit because the ‘‘ opinion leaders in the will show the public
 just what we plan to do communities had not generated sufficient enwhen they put us in power he indicated thusiasm
 for the party and had even failed to however that although the central office would clarify the po int that
 liberal candidates were be willing to help achieve these objectives the actively running campaigns in their constitubulk of the responsibility
 for organization had to encies furthermore he complained that the be borne by the individual constituencies 4 policy committee of
 the party had been left in view of his initial efforts prowse had entirely on its own in drafting a
 platform conreason to be discouraged about the early fortunes sequently it had been compelled to prepare a of liberalism in
 alberta by april 1948 only highly abstract document a created plattwo constituencies grouard and spirit river form and not one
 that had come from the had put tip candidates prowse complained bit people of the province 1 terly of the
 defeatist attitude prevalent in prowsc was adamant in assessing the liberal liberal ranks an attitude which he claimed was party
 s chief woe as apathy indeed he spent the due to the inability of the liberals to win a nextdecadeattemptingtofightthisrootproblem
 provincial election since 1917 as a result many despite this initial blow to the liberal fortunes prowse continued in the
 path that he had deve ham following a tradition instituted with preloped since attaining leadership he remained a decessor prudham

 and of awakening the enthusiasm of the rank and resources this put him in a position of influence file to

 would not organization be won for his part prowse continued with organizaby having cabinet ministers out from ottawa to speak

 executive and the 1950 convention to establish a cia leader mnning all around the country we tried that nor by
 picking the best candidates the only way new constitutional structure for the liberals he we can win is by each
 of us going home to our hoped that changes in the structure of the party constituencies and making sure we
 go out and work would enable him to carry out the work more and speak about liberalism it is afine
 thing it is the efficiently by june 1950 he had worked out a party of the people of tins country

 organization in the past have not clearly attempted to re enter vigorously the pro gained us the results we require
 for political vincial arena it is therefore puzzling why prowse effectiveness because of the magnitude of the task decided in
 1949 to depart from his strategy of of organizing the entire province accordingly working solely towards the establishment of a
 responsibilities would be divided so that no one viable provincial organization by allowing will have ajob too big to cope
 with and so that himself to be drawn into the federal arena un we can give a maximum number of
 people an doubtedly the executive believed that both opportunity of participating in this work federal and provincial constituencies existed to
 help each other as stambaugh made clear at the the plan called for a division of responsibili 1952 convention ties

 that is being to increase representation in ottawa done by each key worker and compare it with the their efforts
 in this direction appear to have work done by others been crowned with success for the party was able in
 essence the plan did nol differ troni many to return five members among whom was prud other party organizations across
 canada how prowse seen here on the right at the 1949 convention announced at that session that the provincial organization
 would put its efforts into the federal campaign ever prowse was unable to carry out this ambi and that of
 party workers when provincial electious organizational plan in most constituencies tions took place the establishment of constituency convenors moreover prowse
 was developing a new was the top priority but by febuary 1951 h was disappointed that the vast majority of
 con strategy in preparation for the all important 1952 provincial election a strategy which did not stituencies had been unable
 or unwilling to consider the province wide organization as a co operate the only link in the chain of command
 which was established were the offices of priority by his own admission the period between october 1950 and december 1951
 was regional directors the others were hastily appointed by prowse himself at election time spent away from organizational work in
 the province as a whole and in the fighting of three several developments following the federal campaigns in by elections
 two provincial and election of 1949 caused a postponment of the one federal this was done he claimed in order
 vast organization plan first james mckinnon to test his organizational plan and its effecretired from the political scene to become
 a tiveness he hoped that the combined effect senator his absence affected the vigor of the of those successful campaigns
 will do more to liberals president stambaugh atireless worker stimulate interest in liberalism in the province and close ally of
 prowse also became a senator than anything else 2 and was unable to continue working actively for the alberta liberals
 with the same determination the immediate results were gratifying the as he had before 1952 although stambaugh liberals won grouard
 and doubled their total vote remained as president forone more year prowse in olds it is difficult to assume however
 that did not have the same access to his valuable the long term results were as rewarding unless services as
 a full time advisor or as a prestigious they reflected an over all organizational strength source of contact by election
 victories for opposition parties were seldom more than pyrrhic gains and there is little by this time prowse was increasingly
 show doubt that the liberal organization still left much ing signs be being unable to separate his provin to be
 desired perhaps of greater significance was cial office from the business of federal politics the fact that an excessive amount
 of money and he worked extremely hard for federal elections time went into these campaigns also the liberal and by
 elections thus dissipating his strength organization elsewhere in the province was severly affected little work was done until a few
 across the province requesting help that the months before the 1952 election situation was serious at this time is evidenced
 by a further setback for the liberals occurred prowse s appeal in the letter in which he said that when
 a dispute arose between prowse and prud the alternative to acceding to this request for ham during the period of
 the by elections prowse funds would be closing ourheadquarters losing had worked very closely with prudham s cam our staff
 and to all intents and purposes abandonpaign in 1949 and relations between the two men ing all effective efforts in
 organization and appeared to be good until late 1951 when education 25 prudham began to question the validity of the
 issue had come to a head but in character prowse s strategy in alberta prudham felt that istic liberal fashion
 no showdown occurred the liberals as a whole had no chance of getting under pressure from mckinnon and stambaugh anywhere
 in the province and that they had prudham agreed to loosen the tight purse strings obviously failed to generate the
 necessary in mid 1954 and the party continued to exist enthusiasm consequently he decided to set up although with less
 money from ottawa periodhis own federal office in edmonton he went on ically it submitted requests for funds from its
 to dissociate himself from the failing provincial supporters who obliged with small contribu liberals a link which in his estimation
 could tions only hurt his own fortunes prudham also was another rebuff experienced by prowse involved in a campaign in
 ottawa to limit the occured in march 1954 when he wrote to prud alberta liberal s ability to spend money
 ham asking him to appear in a radio broadcast to following stambaugh s retirement from the pres discuss the steps
 taken by the federal governidency in 1952 the position had been taken over ment to encourage oil exploration in alberta
 successively by c b carignan of fairview and premier manning he said was continually w edgar of innisfail unlike stambaugh
 who leaving the impression that it is the alberta during his active years had been extremely close government and the
 alberta government alone with the party bagmen in ottawa and who inti which is responsible for the activity prudham mately
 knew and was highly respected by all curtly refused to accommodate claiming that it alberta liberals carignan and edgar were
 local was his belief that provincial and federal politics figures who lacked extensive support of con should be kept strictly
 separate and that he nections would not mingle in provincial affairs in any as a result of this vacuum of
 power prudham way 8 was successful in convincing the federal liberal perhaps as a result of these setbacks prowse bagmen
 and finance committee men that he appears to have lost some of the interest in polishould be put in charge
 of the distribution of tics which had drawn him to the liberal party in federal funds for the province he
 was unhappy 1953 he decided to study law at the university of with what he considered were vast sums of
 money alberta this undoubtedly affected his performspent in the by elections and the 1952 general ance both as an mla
 and outside the legislature election where the results were hardly encour h j macdonald his lieutenant in the legisaging four
 liberals were returned to office lature recalls that between 1952 and 1955 he after obtaining financial control prudham set was
 left alone to conduct the role of opposition out to place demands on prowse in return for outside the house
 prowse displayed a low proallowing him to use specific funds it is not clear file preferring to allow connors to
 take over the what conditions prudham set as indispensable for little organizational work taking place in the his aid in
 the spending of funds but these were province found to be unacceptable by prowse who decid the liberal party then
 appeared by 1955 to edtoturn directly to liberal supporters for help 23 be in the doldrums moving to a nadir
 when it in a meeting of the executive he explained that had never reached a zenith since its revival the
 future of the party of alberta was in the whereas previously prowse and others had balance unless money was forthcoming
 other firmly believed that organizational work would wise he warned the party would not be able to benefit the party
 considerably they now admitsurvive 24 ted openly that social credit and premier the executive was non committal and unwil manning
 in particular were unbeatable forces ling to take a united stand against prudham they an interesting demonstration of this viewpoint
 only agreed to send letters to liberal members was contained one of macdonald s broadcasts during the election in 1952
 when he argued that terms of strengthening the opposition rather manning was running wild for lack of oppos than in
 terms of forming the government ition and urged everyone to send more liberals we must show confidence in our ability
 to to edmonton to watch over the haughty social success or the public will fail to give us crediters 29
 their confidence 32 then just as the liberal party appeared the liberals had reason to be happy with the headed
 for oblivion the landeryou lee contro election results forthe firsttime since 1917 their versy exploded in full force on the
 alberta representation had become respectable morescene 3 it served to give prowse and his over of the 15 liberals elected
 only five were colleagues in the legislature a new breath of life from calgary or edmonton which meant that the
 and it helped prowse to become once again the majority of new mlas came from small towns or excellent speaker
 and organizer that he had been rural areas previously the liberals determined to spear however the election of 1955 clarified
 for the head a campaign charging social credit with liberals what was already painfully obvious gross corruption and nepotism they
 achieved premier manning and not social credit was the this effectively both inside and outside the cause of their defeat
 the liberals had fought legislature their best campaign since the l 9 l 0 s and the manning characteristically wasted
 no time electorate appeared to have been discontented in asserting his own innocence and taking direct with social credit yet
 while the election action he promised the establishment of a improved the liberal position it had failed to royal commission
 to enquire into the allega give them a victory the 1955 election had tions and then dissolve the assembly pre
 indirectly strengthened manning s own hand maturely for the first time in alberta history restoring to him an aura of
 invincibility which he and called for new elections in may 1955 had temporarily lost and which remained with despite the
 fact that the election call caught him until his retirement in 1968 the liberals by surprise they reacted favourably prowse
 while personally re elected was disand swiftly to put their own house in order appointedwiththeresults his position within the funds
 were made available and within a month party still appeared to be secure but it is not clear the party
 had nominated 48 candidates the lead whether he retained any interest in continuing the ership if not the constituencies themselves
 struggle he had become most bitter toward his was involved in fighting its best campaign before own liberals who had
 failed to think positively the alberta public the mass media saw it as the during the campaign first opportunity to
 defeat social credit and by prowse convinced his executive to allocate large sided with the liberals an enormous funds for
 pursuing before the royal commission amount of publicity was generated by the liber the case of the alleged corruption of
 social credit als and despite efforts to introduce other issues officers to this end the party hired a lawyer during
 the campaign tm the landeryou lee affair the commission took over a year to report its provided sufficient ammunition for
 the opposi finding and subsequently it exonerated not only tioli manning and party but even the ministers who although this
 was the first election since 1940 had been allegedly involved in the conflict of whichwasbeingfoughtwithsocialcreditclearly interest the findings of the
 commission dealt a on the defensive the liberals could only hope severe blow to prowse for he had personally that
 public reaction to socred excesses would be accepted responsibility for the liberal party s sufficient to give them a victory
 in fact liberal large expenditure in representations before the organization was conspicuously absent from commission most constituencies liberal candidates on
 the aside from prudhani s criticisms the first whole were hoping to be able to ride to victory on rumblings
 against prowse s leadership came a wave of discontent indeed one of prowse s from h j macdonald deputy leader
 of the party major problems during the campaign was in con and a calgary mla ever since 1952 when vincinghisowncandidatesthattheliberalscould
 prowse began to attend law school macdonald win in a stern letter sent to all the candidates hadbeenlefttocarrythernainburdenofspeaking shortly before
 election day he criticized the for the liberal party in the legislature after negativist attitude which some were displaying 1955
 prowse continued to be absent frequently candidates he said were inclined to talk in from the legislature appearing only irregularly
 when important or controversial issues were discussed during this time macdonald s prestige as deputy leader and acting leader continued
 to grow within the enlarged liberal caucus although he does not appear to have had any leadership ambitions he was
 actively exploring the possibility of finding a replacement for a discouraged and demoralized prowse one of the chief difficulties experienced
 by the party in the 1955 59 period was financial after the expensive electoral campaign and the heavy cost of
 the royal commission the party had been compelled to borrow substantially in order to continue to operate needless to say
 organization suffered enormously as a result little work was carried out until after the 1957 federal election when john diefenbaker
 and his conservatives took office in ottawa for the liberals this defeat was particularly impressive in alberta liberal strength from
 the province was decimated to one member the lowest number since 1935 the purse strings were once again loosened after
 this setback and the executive instructed prowse to see to it that the liberal organization was improved a meeting of
 all regional directors in the province was arranged for september 1957 and subsequent meetings took place between representatives of all
 the constituencies and the leadership it was the biggest effort ever made by the liberal leadership to listen to the
 problems of constituencies the purpose of these meetings in prowse s words was prowse at left with delegates to the
 1947 convention 4 the party s major problems reside in its inability to touch both young people amid the comnmnon
 milan their needs must be taken are of if the party is to become a viable force if most of
 the constituencies had been perceptive enough to realize their problems no one seemed to know how to resolve them having
 had their first open opportunity to contribute to party policy making the constituencies and the regional organizations failed to give
 any advice to the party heads on how to deal with these problems the leadership was left to draft proposals
 of its own the working out of possible solutions was shelved when diefenbaker handed the federal liberals a second stunning
 defeat a year later the liberal party outside the legislature was at least willing to look into ways of increasing
 support it is evident that they had not found new methods to deal with social credit nor to provide new
 issues inside the house the liberal members balance sheet in the 1955 59 legislature to enable us to present a

 constituencies replied massively to the request for these meetings the problems facing them prowse found were as varied as the

 pitiful few incisive questions were asked and debate took place in a routine and uninspired way the only exceptions were
 provided by prowse s skillful interrogation of the government during parts of 1956 and 1957 when alleged corruption by social
 credit was still an issue in 1957 the government introduced bill 95 containing a proposal to give dividends to the
 people of alberta this was designed to distri bute part of the increase in revenue accruing to the ever the
 organization centred around james mckinnon government from oil royalties the liberals he had buili this organization himself and was surrounded
 by a coterie of supporters who owed their first rejected the idea of such dividends as unwarrant allegiance to him

 proper side of the trail the incident occurred about 3 o clock in the afternoon on the bowness road at
 a point about two miles from the city two trails run parallel each wide enough only for traffic one way
 the lower trail is good the other little more than a bridle path the two are separated by a high
 bank the cowboy keeping to the rule of the road chose the lower path the automobiles approaching from the opposite
 direction chose the sa me one on account of their tyres the result was that someone had to move the
 cowboy pulled up his pinto took his feet out of the stirrpus and hung his be shappd legs straight down
 by the sides of his pony the cars slowed down and then stopped each party watched the other for several
 seconds the cow puncher knowing he had the law on his side stood firm in the end the motorists making
 the best of a bad business one after another climbed the high bank and took the rough trail past the
