 local country school but in by time was sent to the moody school for boys in massachusetts and later to
 cat h e r i n e m u massachusetts institute of technology where he qualified as a watchmaker and
 s fll it h jeweller he first came west in 1901 with his oldest brother kenneth to visit an at
 the beginning of the twentieth uncle young frank apparently intended century coal mining was inherently to establish a watch repair
 business in dirty and dangerous work however it calgary but with little demand for this was an essential service for
 the heating service he and kenneth turned their of homes and businesses and the running hands to catching halter breaking
 and of industry alberta had vast amounts of selling horses a subsequent business coal and at its peak hundreds of
 mines combined the sale of high class driving were operating throughout the province horses with dealings in real estate but
 wages did not reflect the hazards of the work and the mines themselves however his real love seemed to lie
 in provided living conditions that were the foothills and mountains where he appalling began prospecting gradually increasing his knowledge of
 topography and onto this stage stepped james francis geology he staked and worked a claim melville moodie known to his
 friends in the prosperous mica mining area of as j f or frank and to his enemies big bend on
 the columbia river in simply as moodie he was born near british columbia but this was seasonal chesterville ontario in
 1878 his work and access was both difficult and parents and siblings having recently dangerous he may have given up
 this moved from quebec where his father adventurous life about the time he and two of his uncles had operated

 began coal were canadian born but of scottish mining east of calgary above 1 frank moodie alberta history spring 2000
 an idealist and visionary moodie had plans to operate a model mine and to have decent living conditions in an
 adjacent village as a result he opened a mine in the red deer river valley five miles downstream from the
 town of drumheller compared to other mining operations in alberta the rosedale or moodie mine as it was commonly known
 was safer and more efficient had better sanitary conditions and paid higher than union wages 2 in addition the adjacent
 company owned townsite had educational and recreational facilities that surpassed every other mine site in the province but in spite
 of all its apparent advantages the mine was plagued with work slow downs and strikes and in the spring of
 1918 some miners were even threatening to wreck the mine and kill moodie 3 how was this possible in spite
 of moodie s dreams his hopes for a model camp that was to end all worker squalor and discontent 4
 may have been doomed from the start this was in part because of the man himself who he was and
 what he represented and in part because of the socio economic climate in which he and the mine were operating
 coal mining in alberta began about 1886 and quickly became one of the province s major industries by the outbreak
 of world war one major fields existed in the crowsnest pass and lethbridge in the south edson farther north and
 in the drumheller valley in the central part of the province 5 during these years the industry was not without
 its problems by the end of 1914 there had been three major mine tragedies in alberta collieries the frank slide
 in 1903 the bellevue mine disaster in 1911 and the hillcrest mine disaster in 1914 all in the crowsnest pass
 as devastating as these natural disasters were living conditions in the mining camps seem almost as appalling because they were
 not only debilitating but also because they were preventable the fact that cholera and typhoid killed fewer people than slides
 or explosions should not dull one s senses to the unsupportable and unnecessary conditions which produced them in mines throughout
 the province single men bunked in crowded unventilated shacks and drew water from inadequate wells or contaminated creeks sanitary facilities
 were frequently inadequate to say the least in one mine in the drumheller valley forty men used the same vermin
 infested toilet which had no proper drainage and no one in particular assigned to clean it 6 while these conditions
 caused the men to complain to management it was bed bugs in the hot cakes at a mine at wayne
 that finally resulted in a strike 7 mining camps varied of course and while these are some of the worst
 examples to come to light in the alberta government coal commission hearings in 1919 they are indicative of health and
 housing hazards that miners encountered in their work beyond the potential perils of the mines themselves above view of the
 tipple at the rosedale mine note the private passenger coach at centre this was probably for the use of frank
 moodie alberta history spring 2000 early in 1911 frank moodie with his workers individually which denied brother kenneth as mine
 engineer malcontents the influence of group started the rosedale coal clay pressure and worst of all he refused to products
 co ltd in retrospect this designate rosedale as a union only appears to have been more than just mine he
 would hire any man who was another project to moodie it would willing to work and given the choice seem
 that he did have a vision for an preferred non union men in an industrial facility which acknowledged increasingly radical
 labour atmosphere the dignity of both the worker and the moodie was the last holdout against a work which provided
 for the whole closed shop in all these factors lay the man body mind and soul the mine seeds of
 discontent works and offices and the camp including accommodations for both in the decade between 1911 and 1921 single men
 and married men with during which frank moodie managed families were laid out with meticulous the rosedale mine discontent was

 who purportedly were and a parasite feeding off honest coming to talk business 2 working men union leaders wanted nothing

 than union wages because he wanted destroying the boiler house and with good workers and he wanted them to three
 hundred pistol packing insurgents have no cause to unionize like william mackenzie the great canadian entrepreneur of railway fame who
 invested substantially in the rosedale mine frank moodie saw no reason why any organization or union should act as liaison
 between him and his men 6 he professed to be ready to discuss anything with his men at any time
 and was baffled that they would be afraid to meet with him in evidence given at the coal commission hearings
 of 1919 moodie acknowledged the inevitability of their being two sides to every issue involving mines and managers regardless of
 whether the owner was private or government but he felt it discriminatory that owners and operators should be bound to
 legal agreements while the men that is the unions who were not chartered were not 2 he believed in the

 in i ic fl alberta history i spring 2000 moodie in 1878 still a description of mackenzie as forthright quick
 to anger and apparently very intimidating could apply equally to moodie and both it seems had a penchant for fast
 cars fancy clothing mansions and grand furniture 25 moodie cut a dashiiig figure in his buffalo hide coat driving an
 open packard around calgary he also owned a norwalk touring car and a number of sporty roadsters he flew his
 own plane raced his own trotting horses and bred pure bi eed hunting dogs which he took on bird hunting
 expeditions with his friends and he had the appropriate costume for every activity from leather flying helmet knee high leather
 working boots and breeches to white silk scarf and fedora while prospecting travelling or at rosedale he lived a simple
 spartan existence but left his family in calgary in a grand house with every comfort he could afford the fact
 that the house was mortgaged to the hilt to finance his business ventures was never known outside the family how
 much of this side of moodie was known to the men and union leaders in the drumheller valley we cannot
 now know calgary and drumheller newspapers reporting events at the mine in 1918 19 referred to him as a dreamer
 two fisted and a man of action 26 other articles referred to him as a despot dictator and blood thirsty
 27 the differences in interpretations surely were in the eyes of the beholders for one group of mine workers howevei
 there was an image of frank moodie that superceded all others these were the men who contracted the spanish influenza
 that came to canada with returning soldiers after world war one four thousand of the 38 000 albertans who contracted
 the disease died and in drumheller five miles from rosedale more than half the population got the disease at the
 rosedale mine three men died of the ninety who fell ill in spite of daily fumigations of the bunkhouse 26
 moodie allowed no one but himself and his brother into the meeting hall and bunkhouse where the ailing men were
 housed over a period of three or four weeks frank brother kenneth and two others unnamed worked twenty hours a
 day maintaining hospital like conditions and nursing the men a calgary newspaper attributed their relative success to the sanitary conditions
 good food and moodie s own robust physique he was called a good angel by a grateful father who wrote
 to thank him for the care given to his son during the epidemic 29 and a group of recovering patients
 presented mr frank with an edison phonograph in gratitude for painstaking care untiring perseverance and his ability to instill confidence
 where all seemed hopeless 3 t the story of labour radicalism begins to draw to a close in 1919 when
 one big union leaders were run out of the district by returned veterans who had taken over a number of
 the valley mines 3 during the unrest some might ask whether moodie s move to replace troublesome foreign miners with
 vets was motivated by discrimination or his great antipathy toward the unions certainly william byron writing in maclean â€˜ s
 magazine considered it laudable that the rosedale mine is now manned almost exclusively by native canadians 32 but it may
 equally have above this is a norwalk roadster driven by frank moodie the cabins of the model village can be
 seen at right alberta history i spring 2000 time the best he did not coi nproniise his principles he still
 believed in his men and in the dignity of both the worker and the work the miners lost considerable time
 and income due to strikes and many suffered humiliation and discrimination at the hands of various factions but according to
 historian ernest hlady a decade or so later the coal operators and men miners solved their labour problems by themselves
 without the benefit or influence from any union official 4 the mine itself survived and continued to operate into the
 1950 s but the original investors never saw much of a return for their money moodie had apparently put all
 the profits into improvements in the mine and camp and towards making conditions comfortable for the men now nearly ninety
 years later some of the original buildings still stand and the site iiow produces some of the finest shale in
 canada following his departure from the rosedale coal clay products co ltd frank moodie entered the oil business combing southern
 alberta for likely formations i ic finally drilled east of turner valley and named his well the sentinel typically he
 promoted his oil business with the same flare he had employed in coal mining travelling extensively throughout eastern canada the
 united states and great britain in an effort to attract investors letters to his wife from this period indicate how
 painful it was for hini to be so far away from his family having never successfully brought in a well
 moodie s oil career was effectively ended by a car accident in 1938 some believe he had been forced off
 the road or that his car had been tampered with by an old adversary with a score to settle or
 by a new rival from the oil world we will never know but he never fully recovered and the broken
 ribs and internal injuries undoubtedly been a personal decision based on the death of moodie s own youngest brother at
 vimy ridge nearly two years earlier that tipped the balance in favour of the war veterans at any rate over
 the next year or two the face of the labour movenient in alberta changed from revolutionary towards a niore politically
 oriented reform and it became possible in 1920 for the editor of a local labour newspaper to speak out in
 moodie s favour condemning the chicken coops still in existence at the mining community of wayne he then reported that
 though frank moodie may have had his faults to his credit he never expected men to live in such shacks
 the editor continued i certainly liked the looks of the camp rosedale and the contrast was so great as to
 make me sorry for lots of hard things i have said about frank moodie in days gone by 35 so
 in the end what was the outcome of the confrontation was moodie s dream nothing more than that and did
 unionism bring him to heel as some the ringleaders had hoped as history so often proves the answer is neither
 black nor white nor even a uniform gray but rather an interplay of both extremes certainly frank moodie saw his
 ideals attacked and part of the mine destroyed as one man standing alone he was unable to stem the great
 wave of radical socialism that was sweeping the working world after the war but he did build a model mine
 and it was for a moodie believed he was creating industrial conditions with which no one could be unhappy he
 looked on the â€˜ boys as part of his family but overlooked that this could be construed as paternalism above

 in 1943 at the age of sixty four the life and career of frank moodie show that interplay to reveal
 a character which is not uniformly one or another flamboyant and generous compassionate and a man of great integrity he
 was also at times obdurate unyielding and overbearing but whether loved or hated he was not easily forgotten catherine munn

 the soil is almost worthless and great stretches are nothing but one vast mass of alkali deposits it was a
 great error on the part of the railway company to lay the line through here if they had gone about
 50 miles north of this they would have found a splendid soil which would have continued almost without interruption to
 the rocky mountains in fact the original location of the line was about 150 miles north of its present position
 and the country through which it would have passed was as good as can be found anywhere in the north
 west territories its present course is much shorter than it would have been if taken further north but it seems
 a penny wise and pound foolish arrangement dr selwyn the government geologist with whom i was travelling having started from
 brandon one day in advance of me was awaiting my arrival at medicine hat 527 miles i arrived there at

 10 o clock we drive to the mines of the saskatchewan coal conipany which are situated about 6 miles up
 the river this is an interesting place to visit as it is the first colliery of any size which has
 been started in the north west we meet here mr woodworth a member of the provincial parliament who is the
 general manager and mr lauson a mining engineer who has the management of the mines there are two principal seams
 of coal the largest of which ranging from 5 to 7 feet thick is now being worked it lies horizontally
 at the bottom of a deep gully 293 feet below the level of the prairie and somewhat higher than the
 river which flows close by it is worked by simple adits or heads driven in on various directions the coal
 is loaded into small wagons or tubs holding half a ton each at the face of the workings then wheeled
 out to the foot of an incline laid with rails down the side of the hill here they are hooked
 on to a rope 4 at a time and dragged up to the top of the slope and on to
 a raised platform then discharged down a shoot sic into the coal trucks at the time of our visit a

 indians who were camped here as soon as the train stopped they crowded round us and seemed very much interested
 in m alberta history i spring 2000 everything they saw some could speak a few words of english and one
 gentleman with a highly colored countenance asked me for 10 cents fearing that i might be scalped if this modest
 request were refused i graciously made him a present of that sum he then made a close inspection of my
 riding breeches and seemed to expect that i should take them off and make him a present of those also
 however at the risk of rousing his angry passions i modestly but firmly declined to do so one little blackfoot
 had a great treasure in the shape of a small common lookingglass to which he had appended a highly ornamental

 take the opportunity of upsetting this popular delusion the country improves towards calgary and some fair agricultural land is passed
 about one mile below calgary we cross the bow river the water in which is so beautifully clear that the
 stones at the bottom can be seen all the way across the color is a brilliant emerald green and flows
 direct from the huge glaciers of the rocky mountains we reach calgary at 5 p m this town is the
 head quarters of the ranching and mining enterprises its promoters claim a great future for it but at present it
 does not present much show of that good time coming owing to an unfortunate dispute about the site of the
 town the inhabitants are unwilling to build any very costly habitations and the majority of the buildings consists simply of
 tents all shapes and sizes and dignified by impressive names such as royal hotel the windsor restaurant and so forth
 the office of the calgary herald a weekly paper just started is situated in a tent and at when we
 called to see the editor we found a member of the mounted police in uniform setting up type evidently there
 is a dearth of compositors in this cheerful spot when they have to fall back on the military for a
 helping hand the difference in time between here and winnipeg is about one hour i e it is 5 o
 clock here when it is 6 o clock in winnipeg this is rather confusing as the railway trains are running
 on winnipeg time and the calgary people keep their own the result is that breakfast seems to be somewhere in
 the middle of the night and supper gets mixed up with the dinner or something like that far left james

 and pair of native ponies we travelled westward along the trail through the lands of the cochrane ranching co this
 is one of the largest ranches or cattle farms in the north west having an ai ea of 176 square
 miles the company had sonic very severe losses last winter over 4 000 head of cattle being killed they were
 brought on to the ranch late in the fall and being in very poor condition after their long journey from
 the south and not being of such a hardy class as is necessary for this northern climate it is easily
 understood that they could not be able to undergo any great hardships the whole stock exceeded 13 000 and represented
 the accumulation of two years only not to speak of the increase during that time the proprietors were certainly in
 the wrong in stocking their ranch so heavily before they had gained experience of the capabilities of the country for
 stock raising however they have got their experience now but have had to pay very dearly for it if the
 right class of animals are brought into the country such a class for instance as the hardy northern scotch cattle
 there is no doubt that they would thrive very well there is very good feed on the prairie and plenty
 of lakes and ponds in the deep valleys and willow bluffs and trees as shelter from storms we arrived at
 the ranche house about noon this is just a small log structure for the accommodation of the employees we had
 to pay heavily for it at the rate of one dollar 4 p per meal per person as it is
 the only place en route at which we could stop we were obliged to submit to this unreasonable charge the
 ranch co do not wish to provide accommodation f or travellers and are therefore very independent and can charge just
 what they please one meets here some very nice people mostly english who have come out to this far away
 country to make their fortunes or bust as the yankees say in cattle ranching or mining the calgary house at

 difficulty of getting supplies hitherto the railway was only laid into calgary in august last calgary is 700 miles from
 brandon the country all round is hilly and shows the first symptoms of the rocky mountains beyond there is one
 drawback to farming and that is the dryness of the soil very little rain falls here and the grass in
 the dry season is parched and shrivelled up by the sun if the land were properly irrigated which will have
 to be done eventually for profitable farming the objection would be entirely overcome when so treated yielded abundantly the present

 which we pass begins to assume a broken and cut up appearance the hills and valleys getting larger and more
 decided in character a great fire had lately been raging over the prairie lying to the north of the trail
 giving it a very blackened dismal appearance it commenced at calgary and struck west going a distance of 20 miles
 and was only stopped in its mad career by a deep ravine over which it had not the energy to
 pass we cross several streams and rivers one of which is known by the cheerful name of ghost river we
 arrived at morleyville about dusk and found a very neat hotel and store morleyville is quite an old village it
 was to this place that the rev mr mcdougall came as a missionary 26 years ago sic 10 years ago
 before the north west was thought of as a field for emigration round them and the children running around in
 a half naked state but they are happy after their own fashion and it would take the concentrated energy of
 ten thousand missionaries to lead them into habits which would be more consonant with those of our own free and
 enlightened country as a means of livelihood the mcdougalls started a store and traded goods with the indians in exchange
 for furs by this method they soon amassed a handsome pittance as a ward says next morning we start from
 morleyville the country getting more broken and hilly every mile we go we are very much disappointed in not having
 a view of the mountains in the distance as ordinarily they can be seen from this point to advantage but
 some immense fires in the pine forests have been raging for weeks and have filled the whole country with smoke
 like a fog this has been caused by the men on the railroad who out of carelessness or intentionally have
 set huge forests on fire when about 20 miles from moi leyville we suddenly come upon the first high mountain
 of the range rising straight into living out here far away from the haunts of civilization when the country was
 scarcely trodden by a white man the rev mcdougall began his task of christianizing the wild indian i could not
 truthfully say that he has been preeminently successful in his civilizing efforts judging by the specimens i had the opportunity
 to see this race called the stony mountain indians or stonys are certainly better off than a good many others
 i saw elsewhere they are tall well built specimens of their kind aiid are about the only band who can
 be made to work they still prefer to live in their teepees rather than log houses which the rev mcdougall
 has been trying all these years to convince them are the best some have log houses which they live in
 during the winter but as may be expected are about as dirty and foul smelling as their teepees i saw
 them squatting on the floor of the huts with their dirty blankets wrapped this race called the stony mountain indians

 we saw some a plentiful supply of buffalo and sheep nice skins of the rocky mountain sheep skins in addition

 here and there alberta history i spring 2000 at the other side of the valley a huge mountain rose almost
 perpendicularly to a height of 2 000 feet its sides thickly covered with pine trees and plants i was so
 impressed with this fine picture that on my return to calgary i succeeded in arousing the enthusiasm of a local
 photographer who will no doubt be rushing off wildly to fix the thing as soon as a suitable opportunity occurs
 on monday night we got to the foot of the cascade mountain 85 miles from calgary and are hospitably entertained
 by mr mann one of the railway contractors who has a number of men working here we are now at
 this point 4 502 feet above sea level and in a valley through which runs a stream known as devil
 s head creek next morning we go out on foot to see the cascade coal mine which has recently been
 discovered on our way we strike the camp of dr george dawson one of dr selwyn s staff who is
 making a geological exploration of this part of the mountains it was very curious that in such a great area
 of country we should accidentally meet at this spot the mountain takes its name from a stream or cascade of
 water which comes tumbling down one side of the mountain it is very pretty to see it rushing down the
 steep sides though at the distance we were away it presented the appearance of a fine silver thread to any
 person afflicted with an inordinate poetical or sentimental disposition i can recommend this fine view as calculated to rouse the
 slumbering muse but we should always remember the warning of the poet 1 hold it truth that he who flings
 his thoughts and fancies into verse may often prove a deadly curse those who think of higher things and though
 the gifted author of these lines may have inadvertently included himself in this condemnation he of course meant to hurl
 the stigma at those who deliberately and periodically choke the public with their brainless effusions we next visited the cascade
 coal mine situated on the north side of the devil s head creek operations have only just been commenced and
 at present it is impossible to tell with any degree of accuracy the extent of the deposit the the cascade
 mountain is the highest one of the range in this vicinity it is 5 060 feet above the level of
 the plain on which we stood the summit was quite visible the morning being brighter and clearer than it had
 been for a long time and we were thus enabled to see it in all its beauty a certain distance
 up the mountain the timber ceases to grow and that point it is called the timber line above this the
 rocks are bare and formed of irregular shapen masses of a light brown color the effect with the sun shining
 full upon it was simply lovely the color rocks might almost be supposed to be a mass of gold of
 a pale yellow tint so much did the sunlight heighten the effect and the clear blue sky immediately above made

 and mapping thus field surveying experience and intensive study prepared deville for responsible positions with the federal government in the
 years to come deville joined the department of the interior s dominion lands branch in 1880 as one of fifty
 six party chiefs working on dominion lands surveys he began by surveying township outlines in the touchwood hills area of
 southern saskatchewan the dominion lands surveys had been under way since 1871 some 15 million acres having been surveyed to
 keep ahead of the influx of immigrant settlers and reconnaissance for a proposed transcontinental railway by 1880 survey control along
 widely separated base lines and meridians had been laid down as far west as edmonton in anticipation of rising demands
 for the survey of the western interior on which deville was employed proved to be a larger and more difficult
 project than first anticipated first there was a shortage of experienced surveyors available so provincial land surveyors from eastern canada
 had to be imported second township surveys were done under private contracts a situation often resulting in mistakes being made
 due to hurried surveys and inexperienced surveyors third the logistics of deploying a few survey crews separated by vast distances
 where the only means of transportation was by horse and cart presented formidable problems in communication and provision of supplies
 at that time section and quarter section corners were marked by wooden posts and earth or stone mounds however these
 posts decomposed after a few years and indians and others often found them useful for firewood and tent pegs thereby
 obliterating their use as legal property corners deville demonstrated his wise foresight by substituting more permanent iron posts above this

 as a surveyor and astronomer in quebec where he obtained professional standing as a quebec land surveyor in 1877 and
 was appointed inspector of surveys in that province like many ambitious young men at that time he was attracted to
 the opening of the west while gaining valuable experience on township surveys deville studied for and wrote several examinations in
 subjects including surveying mathematics mapping and astronomy this led to his professional commission as a dominion land surveyor dls and
 a certificate as a dominion topographic surveyor dts in 1877 the dls commission was a requirement for surveying crown lands
 into townships the dts certificate was a title of special distinction bestowed on canadian surveyors who proved their knowledge of
 higher surveying theory and practice only thirty five men in canadian history achieved the he recalled when deville became inspector
 of surveys the completed surveys were now that was one of the first things i confined to southern manitoba and
 a did when i joined the service l 880 small area around prince albert it was to urge the substitution
 of saskatchewan deville recalled later iron posts for wooden posts hitherto used the posts in that country were we were
 only starting and an mostly of poplar and those were of no organization had to be created but use whatever
 as the numbers you cannot create in a day or a year an disappeared from them in a few years
 organization great enough to deal with so i asked that we be allowed to use the immense amount of work
 we had iron posts well the minister sir to undertake still the work was john a macdonald did not believe
 in started and in two years that is in 1883 we did the largest amount of accurate surveying or any
 permanent surveying or anything like that he had surveying we ever did when we subdivided twenty seven million a notion
 of his own and would not listen about iron posts at all the acres the organization kept wooden posts were
 good enough for perfecting itself with experience and direction and in 1885 we had a very him i tried to
 bring forth all the arguments i could for iron posts and good organization indeed but hard times struck us and
 later on harder among them i pointed out that in times still the word went around surveying the open prairies
 there was no wood there and we would have to then just as it does today that we were to
 save in all directions that carry our cumbersome wooden posts with us i pointed out the convenience every expenditure that
 could be avoided should be dispensed with of the iron posts in comparison and that is one problem we have
 to solve the minister said to go ahead and use we have to make a survey of these them but
 the surveyors would have to lands and the men to make a survey of pay for them well we got
 the iron the lands are the land surveyors posts anyway and i don t think the that is their profession

 used to draw plans such as township and settlement plans for the disposal of public lands rigorous regulations wei e
 drawn up by deville s office governing the format for plans related calculations and filing systems to provide consistency throughout
 the system from field operations to the final plans and documents as surveyor general deville was always concerned with accuracy
 in conducting ci own lands surveys measurement of distance using chains presented the most difficult problem due to often encountered
 hilly tree covered terrain variations in field temperature and measuring across or around large bodies of watei surveyors were usually
 skilled enough in measuring to reduce slope measurements to horizontal applying necessary corrections and triangulating across or around obstacles on
 line however no niatter how exact the lines were measured out if the surveyor was using a chain of incorrect
 length errors would result in the length of the quarter section sides in the early years when each dominion land
 surveyor received his commission he was given a three foot yardstick made of pine with which he was to veril
 y the length of his field chains which were usually 66 foot steel link chains it was common for the
 surveyors to find that their field chains varied two inches or more l rom the correct length this would amount
 to an error of about thirteen feet per mile whereas the maximum perniissible error should not have exceeded about two
 feet per mile to reduce the amount of error in chaining due to this cause deville made an important improvement
 by having all surveyors verify their field chains with standardized steel chains so that corresponding corrections could be made to
 lengths laid out for quarter section sides this made a marked officials went to john a macdonald saying that their
 grant iiiust be surveyed within the year in their opinion government surveyors could not possibly subdivide such a huge area
 and suggested that their railway surveyors should do the survey instead fortunately deville was able to persuade macdonald to let
 the more experienced and skilled dominion land surveyors do the job this action on deville s part prevented loss of
 control of the western surveys to railway men who had neither the skill nor knowledge needed to lay out the
 complex township system in 1885 deville s administrative and surveying ability led to his appointment as the third surveyor general
 of canada a position he held for almost forty years in his new position he moved fi oni the field
 to an ottawa office and became responsible for the management of all surveys made under four successive dominion lands acts
 in canada between 1883 and 1908 this included issuing instructions to field surveyors examining and recording plans of survey showing
 disposal of crown lands initiating surveys to mark and maintain provincial boundaries and providing advice related to legal land descriptions

 for settlement of all times and in all countries and whose life was a struggle to create and maintain an
 accuracy hitherto unknown in such surveys 5 deville held the position of surveyor general of canada for thirty nine years
 until his death in 1924 canadian survey history refers to this period as the deville era extending from 1882 to
 1924 his signature as surveyor general is found on many township plans throughout the three western provinces these plans are
 still being used as the basis for titles to land ownership throughout all settled rural areas historian don thomson sums
 up deville s contribution as follows for the greater part of the four following decades after becoming surveyor general deville
 exercised an unparalleled and beneficial influence upon the entire range of land surveying activities in this country and in the
 later years of his career on initial developments in the realm of canadian air photographic surveys possessed of a remarkable
 iiiventive mind linked with marked prowess in mathematics and a genius for administration deville was stamped from the beginning of
 his residence in canada as a brilliant leader in his chosen field of endeavour these special qualities combined with unflagging
 industry enabled him to bring world renown to the organization he directed for almost 40 years 7 douglas barnett is

 named to commemorate his contributions to surveying and photo mapping an historic site monumeiit to his memory was erected at
 the entrance to yoho national park near field b c on september 30 1975 and a special monument commemorating both
 the alberta british columbia boundary survey and dr edouard deville was erected in robson pass north west of jasper in
 1924 an official report filed af ter the ceremony described deville as a scientist to whom canada owes most largely
 her magnificent system of land surveys and also the introduction of photo topography a method so well suited to her
 mountain areas and so successfully carried on in mapping them it is fitting his name should be on record at
 a place where their grandeur reaches a climax 5 dr deville was the guiding star for the dominion lands surveys
 throughout his career the surveys were in the forefront of a great expansion advancement and conquest of a new frontier
 at the time j n wallace dls states e deville must be considered to have held the record in having
 had charge alberta history spring 2000 u hot heads and cold feet it was not their fault that most of
 the directed hot air went directly through the ceiling nor was it their fault that the air by c h
 a r i e s d that did travel across the ceiling lost den n ey much of its remaining
 heat as it travelled down the cold walls of course it was cold air that made its way back across
 the floor to the furnace and of course it froze the feet of the pupils and the mr waterbury obviously
 thought he had teacher created the most efficient means of heating a school when he invented the mind you if
 the furnace worked hard waterbury furnace one has to wonder enough and long enough some warm however if he lived
 long enough to learn air did accumulate but it was around the that it was a real monstrosity one has
 heads of the pupils and their feet were also to wonder that the school officials still cold also the teacher
 was so who wished it onto so many one roomed situated that his head was swimming in schools early in
 this century ever the hot dry air unfortunately he repented of their complicity couldn t fold his feet up under
 himself the way some of the children learned to the waterbury furnace made by the do even felt shoes often
 failed waterman waterbury company consisted of a large furnace like stove before mr waterbury came onto the that sat on
 the floor in the corner of the scene schools were heated by a variety room it was surrounded by a
 metal of stoves some were pot bellied some i i i i 1 jacket about five and a half feet
 high it were upright cylinders and some were however stood up from the floor by horizontal cylinders often they sat
 several inches the theory was that the fairly close to the entrance on the theory heated air would shoot directly
 up to the that they caught the cold air that came in ceiling across in all directions and through the
 door the children could down the walls to the floor it would then warm both their front sides and their
 come creeping back under the jacket to back sides by standing close to the stove be heated again in case
 the air became and absorbing the heat that radiated too dry or lost its oxygen there was also sideways they
 could warm their hands a duct that brought fresh air in from the by holding them over or near the
 stove outside they could dry their mittens the same way and frequently with some it was brilliant of mr waterbury
 to ingenuity they could keep their lunches realize that hot air would rise and that from freezing by putting them
 near the cold air would then gravitate back to the stove not one of these things could they furnace to
 be re heated but mr do with a waterbury furnace waterbury and the school officials who fell for his invention
 really didn t know unfortunately of course much of the anything about satisfactorily heating a heat generated by these stoves
 also went school or any other building out through the ceiling and the ualberta history i spring 2000 uninsulated walls
 naturally the children had cold feet the teacher s head swam in the hot air while his feet also froze
 and he tried to stay alert and upright another feature of the old fashioned stove as well as of the
 waterbury furnace was the long string of stove pipes fastened by wire to the ceiling that ran to a chimney
 at the far end of the school by the time the smoke from the fire reached the cold chimney it
 frequently cooled enough that creosote condensed out and dripped how bad it was depended on the kind of fuel used
 mr waterbury wasn t the only expert who didn t know what he was doing scads of architects also betrayed
 their ignorance when they were designing larger schools or maybe it was the heating engineers and the architects simply had
 to go along anyway when the four roomed brick school was built at consort in 1917 i was there would
 you believe it the hot air from the furnace below was made to come into the room through a big
 register near the ceiling in an inside wall the cold air was recovered through a similar big register near the
 floor in the same inside wall of course by now you know the pattern the hot air travelled across the
 ceiling and became cold air as it settled down the windows and of course the cold air travelled across the
 floor with the children s feet knee deep in it back to the return air register in this case however
 there was one mitigating factor somehow provision had also been made for heating the basement in much the same way
 so the classroom floors were relatively warm even though the air movement in the rooms was sluggish and the basement
 floor was cold when i taught in cereal s original tworoomed school there was no such mitigating influence you guessed
 it the hot air came through a register high on an inside wall and the cold return air travelled across
 the floor to the register at the base of the same wall oh yes the children had cold feet and
 the teacher had a hot head some time before 1932 the trustees discovered that this system of heating was just
 not adequate no doubt their children told them so anyway they converted their furnace to that other marvel of heat
 engineering the floor furnace this furnace differed from the waterbury furnace in that it was in the basement but it
 was distinguished by having two jackets one close to the furnace directed the heat up through a round metal grate
 the other a few inches away and around the first extended up to the floor the theory was again that
 the return air would travel back across the floor to the portion of the grate that covered the hot air
 jacket and settle down through the outer jacket to the base of the furnace there it would be re heated
 as it travelled back up within the inner jacket it differed from the earlier system in that it required no
 piping moreover the children could stand on the warm air above this is a view of a rural school at
