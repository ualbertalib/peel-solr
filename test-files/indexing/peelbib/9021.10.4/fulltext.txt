 to fred a shred of respectability to stand upon still fred was well known and had his good points his

 visible supply then later when snow was deep and no more could be brought from benton by trail he sprung
 his corner and everyone had to buy sugar from fred even the redoubtable i g baker co at fred s
 own price which went up to nearly 80 a bag before he got through at one time fred pace is

 the information contained in this article it will be noticed in many of the ordersin council regarding the location of

 after he first saw the nearly a year prior to the first reserterritory along the c p r west of

 land sursteam arising out of the hot water both veys had been extended up along the at the cave and
 basin and also at the line of the canadian pacific railway upper hot springs there is no doubt sufficiently to
 determine the location that the engineers surveying the line of in sections of any particular parcel of the canadian pacific

 with this matter was that the west down the river for some distance above erly limit of the canadian pacific

 was standing and in fair ary course was about northwest anc preservation a trapper s log hut located southeast which
 thus brought the coai on the south bank of the bow river about claims behind cascade mountain wher 150 yards

 previously no owner for the log hut tion with that company s land grant id this view of the upper
 hot springs at banff national park was taken before the area had been fully developed but even before the turn
 of the century the fame of the hot springs had spread far and wide section 11 chapter 1 4 vic

 no degree of land not fairly fitted for settle current in ordinary conditions therefore ment the company shall not be
 obliged was admirably adapted for the use of to receive them or part of said grant a raft and further
 it is not wide at that the deficiency was to be made up else point where so after the mountains
 were i found mccabe mccardell and sevreached the canadian pacific railway eral others at the cave the bottom land grant
 obtained very few lands of the cave was about 20 feet below very many and glowing reports about the surface
 of the ground access the virtue of the springs were in circula was obtained through the arched roof tion in
 calgary and in september 1885 which was about four or five feet thick i decided to visit the place in
 question by a circular hole about two feet in di i was not personally known to any of ameter which
 the hot vapor rising from the claimants which circustance was the cave had caused a spruce pole of advantage afterwards
 in the settle long enough to extend from the top to ment of these claims it was discovered the bottom
 of the cave had been cut that mr keefe s claims for providing the branches trimmed off to about six
 access to these springs consisted of a inches from the stem was the means of few ties lashed together by
 telegraph ingress and egress the pole being used wire and forming a raft both ties and as a ladder the
 inside of the cave wire being owned by the canadian pad looked very much more attractive than fic railway there
 was a wire stretched it does today there were a great many across the river about due north of where
 stalactites and stalagmites and the the cave and basin is and the raft was water was a delightful temperature for
 so equipped that if a person on the op bathin 9 in posite bank of the river to where the
 i asked mr mccardell to show me raft was lying needed it he could haul the way to the upper
 hot springs and 11 he told me that as he had some friends springs and in their immediate neighbor come
 to visit him on that day that he hood be and they are hereby reserved would not be able to
 meet my request from sale or settlement or squatting viz i asked him if they thought i could find all
 of sections 13 14 15 22 23 24 25 my way there and was told they were 26 27 and
 28 and those portions of sec certain i could not however i had no tions 34 35 and 36 lying
 south of bow difficulty in finding it i asked david river all in township 25 in range 12 keefe if
 he could show me the devil s west of the 5 th meridian head lake lake minnewanka and he signed
 john j mcgee said he had not the time and could not clerk privy council get anyone to show me
 and assured me that i could not find my way without a an interesting point with regard to guide i
 had however no difficulty in the banff hot springs arose some years reaching the lake althought it was pretty later
 when the government decided to hard travel owing to brule which caused provide access to the cave by driving a
 great deal of fallen timber on that a tunnel which is the present access visit i also saw the outcrop
 of coal where a very lengthy petition signed largely anthracite was first opened and that by calgary people and among
 others without a guide although i was again some government officials was sent to told by mr keefe that it
 would be sm the department of the interior protesting possible to find it without one cascade against the tunnel as
 the beauty of river canyon was crossed by log from the cave would be greatly marred if the bank to
 bank these things are men tunnel were driven in the reply the tioned as they stood me in good stead
 officials received from the department when later i had to report on the alleged was to the effect that if
 the policy of the discovery of these springs and the pro department could not be approved by motion of them
 by claimants for remun them there was only one thing for them eration for the alleged service to do and
 that was to resign i do not know that any government official since as the result of my trip to
 banff it that date in calgary has ever protested was strongly recommended that a reser against any action of the
 government vation be made and the description of the land embraced in the reservation owing to the survey already menwas
 drawn up by myself an order in tioned made by mr fawcett it was a council was passed on november

 number eight west of the fifth meridian long for insertion here in the north west territories intersects the eastern boundary
 of the province the fact of reserving the land by an of british columbia or if there be more order
 in council o f november 1885 than one such point at the most northerly caused an immense amount of squatting
 of such points thence northerly along to take place the people connected with the eastern boundary of the said range
 this squatting thinking thereby that they number eight to the northern boundary would establish their right to certain of township

 b c owing to the character of the timber in that proposed reservation there it would appear that in order
 in counwas such a demand for it that a con cil of june 8 1911 that the reservation siderable portion
 of the reservation was had been greatly reduced it will be disposed of the probabilities are that observed that the
 reservation by orderif the writer had first seen the place in council of may 30 1895 consists of after the
 construction of the railroad one and one half townships or 54 through this pass he would probably square miles but
 it has been reduced not have recommended it as a reserva by the order in council mentioned to tion as

 british columbia will show southerly width of about eight miles and a large number of reservations along having an area
 of approximately 160 square miles the west of sicamous lake they were all suggested by the forestry branch there may
 have been some slight of the federal government and there changes in the park reservations which has been a great
 deal of controversy i have recited and which i have not regarding them it has been alleged by discovered but
 i think not stockmen in the district that some of those reservations are detrimental to there is one very notable
 reservation their interests and also to the public namely mount assiniboine park which interests their representations are dif takes in
 approximately 24 square miles ficult to understand for they assert it is extending from about one and one half a
 b enef it that many of the reservations miles south of mount assiniboine to which were made to protect timber
 and about four miles north and having an thereby protect snow and by that means average width of the summit
 of the it was supposed would furnish a longer mountains of probably four miles season of moisture for the growth
 of the british columbia government set grass should be done away with their apart a belt of land lying along
 the assertion is that the whole theory is banff windermere trail from the summit wrong that if you want to
 get pasture of the rocky mountains to the mouth of in that country you must burn off the the sinclair
 pass having a ten mile brush so as to give free flow to the preci width five miles on each

 by ray bagley back in the days before the era of motor transportation and of paved roads the trails that
 were travelled by the indians and pioneers seemed to wander aimlessly across the country yet they had a general direction
 and eventually reached their destination sloughs and swamps were avoided and higher ridges were traversed where more firm footing was
 to be found the general direction led to the draws and ravines which went down to the fords and crossings
 of creeks and rivers trails were rutted deep by the poles of the travois and the wheels of the red
 river carts carts were made wholly of wood and away to be in the village all told green bull buffalo
 hide so long as there were fewer than twenty five souls wood or buffalo hide was available and who resided
 in lacombe when i first both were plentiful any cart was re saw it there was a hotel the albion
 pairable broken parts were replaced house on the site of the present laon the old pieces were put back in
 place combe hotel built i believe by major and bound with green bull buffalo hide james walker of calgary it
 was a which when dried held the pieces frame building set up on wooden blocks securely together until the hide
 was worn and had only recently been finished out when it was replaced by another it was not licensed at
 that time but piece oftimes a keg of beer found its way into the cellar through a trap door in
 most of the indians had progressed the kitchen floor the hotel was opento the carts by the nineties but there
 ated as a boarding house by frank and were still a few at that time using tra his wife who
 had come in from a homevois it was not an uncommon sight to stead just north of town occasionally see
 an old man riding on a travois with they had a dance out there even after the women on foot
 strung out for a mile they came to lacombe or more behind loaded down with their meagre camp equipment followed
 by i remember one night when a dance sore footed dogs packed with all they wcis in progress bill brewster
 and i were could carry most indian ponies knew just young kids and had not acquired the camping grounds and
 when they the ant of dancing george brewster were reached they would turn in off the bill s uncle had
 left a fine team of black trail and wait until the women arrived mares in coltenman s livery stable we
 and took the tepee off the travois and hitched them to the sleigh and drove relieved them of the poles
 out to where the dance was held and watched through the window it was seemingly the noble red man had
 a cold night 50 below zero we soon passed out of the picture before my time got fed up with
 that and started back for i remember lacombe as a tiny hamlet to lacombe it was grey and cloudy of
 few people and fewer buildings snow blowing and our tracks were there were quite a number of people soon obliterated
 there were practicalsettled on land within a ten or fifteen ly no fences in the country and as the mile
 radius b ut there were only nine snow was deep and crusted the horses buildings of any sort in the
 village lurched and scrambled through the two of these were stables plus a log snow and the sleigh went jerkity
 jerk house that belonged to the andrew at every step somehow somewhere glass family west of the edmonton trail we
 crossed the railroad to the east and which however was considered too far wandered down the long slough that 114

 line this view is from the grain elevator looking towards the main business part ol town runs for miles east
 of the railroad track very plentiful when frozen he paid we missed lacombe entirely and the the indians a dollar
 a nick piled on the horses headed for their home range ice at the lake on his return journey we
 didn t orient ourselves until we were to lacombe he would load up with fish down at the upper end
 of nelson lake as much as his cayuses could haul and which was known locally at that time as sell
 them to all and sundry at five cents standish s some four or five miles south each as they lay
 in the open box of however we got back to lacombe and the sleigh every dog in town had a
 fish put the horses in the stable before the as long as they lasted the dogs got dance broke up
 and george was none to know the sleigh and would meet the the wiser mail the same as the people
 of lacombe george jamieson and his wife jennie the post office was out in the middle had the only store
 just north of the of railway street just a short distance hotel on railway street they lived in south and
 east of the albion house the back of the store and the room above there was a b ear chained
 at the back was used for the local gatherings seems and he dug underneath to hibernate to me they had
 church there until the kids used to poke him with sticks and school house was built down by the he
 would become angry and come out slough east of town george had a and stand on his hind legs at
 the end homestead out at jackfish lake about ci the chain and growl something fierce three and half miles south
 west of town when they left he would go back to his brothers john and fred had land bed and
 sleep until the kids came to in the same locality just back of peter town again with more sticks talbot
 s farm a mn dalmage was the postmaster after mr dalmage passed on george and his son crawford drove the
 mail had the post office in the back of the to buffalo lake where there was an old stone and
 they moved upstairs but as trading post and a settlement of english his health was not too good he sold
 people he used to buy fish from the the stone to jimmie johnston and went indians there mostly pike which
 were out to his land at jackfish lake 19 billy schmock built a small building north to sell to the
 settlers oftimes between the hotel and jamieson s stone penned them in the corral overnight in which he had a
 barber shop in the hoping to make a sale while there it front and a meat shop in the rear

 the country to buy not have been a disgrace to the calgary an animal to butcher i went with him
 stampede as i had a good horse and when mounted i was much handier than he was harry colterman s
 wife died leaving for i practically lived with a horse be him with a baby boy the jamiesons tween my
 knees george and jennie took the baby and looked after him until coltenman mar we left lacombe one morning and
 ned again coltenman leased the stable went out to parlby s north of alix where to billy armstrong who had
 recently schmock bought two range cows we come from rushville nebraska he had them back in lacombe by sundown went
 out onto land he had acquired it would be quite a feat nowadays but somewhere north of lacombe his little
 was thought of it then wife s brother had land nearby and they bought a purebred bull on a 50
 50 we had better horses in those days basis the brother in law had possesthough not necessarily of better breed
 sion of the bull and coltenman thinking ing still there were many good sires he was not getting as much
 use of the in the southern pant of the province animal as he was entitled to went over where most
 of our horses came from to argue the matter with the brother the horses were raised in a different in
 law a squabble ensued and as a manner on the wide open range flies result colterman was shot through the
 and mosquitoes were terrible and they neck no bones were broken so colterwould nearly drive the horses crazy at man
 being a rugged individual took night the poor beasts would nun the bull and went home i remember against the
 wind for miles and miles to he wore a bandage around his neck get some relief from the mosquitoes for
 some time afterwards but as it was foals were usually raised in that way just a private family quarrel nothing
 and as a consequence developed more was done about it colterman laid no and stronger muscle and lung power change
 and he did have the bull than those now raised in small fields and paddocks as a general rule set
 eventually a liquor license was setlers built smudges and banked them cured for the hotel and some lively with sod

 the hannas that school house place just back of the department stone yard was full of horses on the corner
 of barnett avenue and nanton street the back of the building the winter of 1894 was bitterly cold was used
 as a workshop and the front the logs of the school walls were green as a showroom often we would
 put on and they shrunk away from the plaster the gloves and he would teach us the letting in the
 winter i don t know how art of boxing one of the boys johnny the kids survived the old log
 school morton was an apt pupil and he outhouse was floored with green lumber maneuvered bill one night and knocked
 wide ten inch boards and as they dried and shrunk it left crevices between them him oven a pile of
 saddles onto his back that finished our lessons snakes were plentiful underneath and as many of the children were barefooted

 operated a snake crawled up and over the foot a general store they took a lot of pelts of a
 scholar the desks were home from the indians and trappers six muskmade of native lumber and not fastened rat hides
 for a quarter i watched them to the floor and usually a desk on two check the hides many times
 it didn t was upset spilling books and slates seem like much but i fared a little the girls some
 at least may have been better as i got seventy five cents for frightened but as fan as the boys
 were coyote skins and thirty five cents for a concerned it was just an excuse to work mink mack s
 brother sid norman moroff a little surplus energy our teacher nison and cyrus b ching helped in elvie green was
 lenient as she didn t the stone i saw some years ago that admire snakes either ching had become a
 labor tycoon in the united states and had a parley our next teacher was married but with the president at

 was a blacksmith by taming peter talbot who later on be trade his shop was erected on nanton came a
 senator to take over the teach street with a dwelling house just being job that was also a fortunate day
 yond he bought a quarter section of for the scholars every child in the land east of town just past
 the bush school worked his best to try to please that s where i had my first encounter him he
 was wonderful no trouble with a plow someone plowed 15 acres even the dumb ones made progress he in a
 haphazard fashion for john who had was a teacher and a friend it cropped that year i endeavored to backset
 it for him in payment on our the first agricultural fair was held in blacksmith bill i had a big
 lean old the school house yard and as the slough was dry the judging was done there i grey mare
 with a hitch in one hind leg and a good little black horse blind of or worked driving a team
 on a slip scraper eye for a plow i had one of those oldto help build the grade to the
 grounds fashioned 1 o n g h a n d 1 e d ontaric andy anderson held the scraper and
 mr walking plows it was called a foo poole was grade boss just fancy build burner the breaking was poorly
 dons ing a grade like that with one of those little shovels that would only hold about and many roots
 were left uncut neithe the harness non singletnees were ton a hatful of earth we did things the strong and
 as a consequence i seldom hand way in those days had a button left on the front of my shin
 dan gourlay was in the lumber busi from being jerked over the handlebane ness he put up a small building
 on of the plow when we encountered a solic barnett avenue just east of the hard root 22 an indication
 of lacombe s growth was in its construction of substantial buildings here premier a c rutherford lays the corner stone
 for the new public school on august 21 1907 john also had a homestead west of he asked me one
 day if i would bring town on the gull lake road he had a load of wood for the church
 i knew a few acres of it fenced with tamarack more about horses in those days than nails but decided
 to abandon the land i did about wood in fact i still do and sold the rails to dr findlater
 about anyway i went over east a few miles four miles up the edmonton trail again and cut a load
 of big trees the snow i was pressed into service to deliver the was deep and it was quite a
 chore to rails as a further contribution on fin get some of those logs onto the sleigh cham s bill
 doc was always on hand just as i was getting the last log on the when i arrived at his
 place to inspect sleigh my father came by on his way and count the rails as they were un to
 get a load of hay he looked the loaded i remember one load i hauled wood over and said son
 i don t know had more than the usual run of small whether the lord will give you much rails
 doc seemed quite displeased and credit for that load of wood i m sure said the man declared there were
 no i wouldn t it was black poplar and fishing poles among them i learned later that this kind didn
 t burn very well the first hardware store in lacombe was put up by george reid on barnett i remember
 something about edward avenue and is now occupied and owned mitchener he was a methodist mmby morrison and johnson though
 it has isten also and was in the lacombe area been enlarged greatly since those days for a while there
 was a picnic down norman morrison who came to lacombe in the place at banff that is now the in
 1898 was one of the few earlier ones buffalo paddock my mother and mrs who has had a continuous residence
 johnny brewster who was the mother of there all the brewster boys had a big heavy basket of food and
 were trudging along the first church in the town was toward the picnic grounds followed by erected by local subscription
 and labor their respective broods the basket was on alberta street the methodists were really heavy as it contained enough
 first and mn chegwmn was the minister food to feed both tribes a gentleman 23 who was also travelling the
 same way there was a big celebration july lst offered to carry the basket for them one year with not
 many white people in those days ladies didn t speak to but around 700 indians and three thoucasual strangers and
 they said oh no sand horses we raced horses for a solid they would manage it was a hot day
 week into the village both ways and neither woman was as slender as sometimes from the north and someshe had
 been some thirty years earlier times from the west i realize that the gentleman again offered his services what i
 write is tied up very much with and yet again and my mother said the horse but it was our
 only means of if i didn t know better i d think you transportation in those days were a methodist
 preacher and could the indian camped in a semi circle smell the chicken in the basket the man replied madam
 that is what i am reaching from the flewelling farm a half mile deep to the west with the i
 m the methodist minister from can other end on what is now the gull lake more he later became senator
 mit road on the edmonton trail they chener raced from the edmonton trail into the his son roland mitchener was
 village from the west born on the burns homestead just east there was one race of seventy indians of lacombe
 little did i think when and horses a horse in the lead stepped i saw him as a baby though
 he did into a hole and fell and those behind have a husky voice that he would become speaker of
 the house of commons piled oven on top just like water pouring over a dam miraculously the in hiram flewelling
 lived just on the dian rider escaped with a few bruises outskirts of town where the buildings but the horse
 was dead that indian of the experimental station now stand sat on his dead horse and cried as his son
 nelson was the first white though his heart would break somechild born in the anea 1892 i think one took
 a hat and passed it among nelson lived just east of lacombe a few the people and collected more money
 miles and became a successful stockman than the horse was worth his tears and farmer were soon dried and it
 didn t take long for his squaws to get the hide off the i have never measured time by days
 or weeks or years but rather by events so if these events i mention do not follow one of the
 earliest buildings in the lacombe area was the ranch of ed barnett established in succession still they were all before
 in the 1880 s it was a welt known stopping the turn of the century house on the old calgary
 edmonton trail 24 horse and presently many indians were started a ranch out on the rough meaeating horsemeat dows north
 of the nose hills several of the boys and i helped to drive the the first threshing machine in the
 cattle out to the new location where neighborhood was not of much force bob had a haying crew at work
 we but it was better than the flail the didn t have much trouble with them machine was a tread
 power using a until we reached tail creek we were team of heavy horses or three smaller camped on the
 flat on the west side ones there was a slatted frame on an of the creek about half a mile
 north of angle on which the horses were tied the red deer river something spooked and their weight forced the
 slats down them during the night and they were ward forcing them to climb continuously away on a stampede one
 of the boys thereby turning the nod that drove the on night herd gave us the highball and cylinder two
 hundred and fifty bushels as we had our horses saddled and on was about all that was accomplished in picket
 we were soon up on the lead a day and had them running into the tail end of the heard
 milk stuff doesn t nun more settlers were arriving each one like range cattle but they did keep on putting
 a few acres under cultivation until daylight we didn t have time a man frank ramsay came in from to
 pull on our boots and rode out the kansas bringing a machine that had a night in our sock feet
 circular horsepower that used six teams of horses bill fawcett who lived five there was a half breed on the
 river or six miles northwest of town brought just below where we were camped one of the same type these
 machines jimmy house he branded with a were fed by hand there was a table square and a rafter over
 making the on which the bundles were pitched house there were only two places east someone cut the bands and
 a man stood of tail creek with any habitation one in front of the cylinder and spread the south of
 botha and another south of sheaves so they would feed into the where castor is located near what we machine
 evenly most times i had the called lane s lake never before or job of cutting bands on the sheaves
 since have i seen grass grow as tall i was not tall enough to reach the table higher than our
 heads when we were to advantage and bundles were piled on our horses bob was very unfontunfor me to stand
 on sometimes someone ate he had 700 tons of hay but the would take my place cutting bands and man
 he left in charge let the cattle run i would sit in the centre of the horse into the stacks
 where they tramped power and keep the horses in motion down and wasted half of the hay it i don
 t remember when the presbyter was a long hard winter snow deep and a late spring out of the 500
 there was ian church was built or who was the first minister i know we were still only 160 head
 of very thin cattle left in the following spring racing horses down the street by the church for the judges
 of the races had we may have had another presbytenabandoned the log stable and were ian minister before the rev
 mathew using the steps of the church as a judge s white but he is the first i recall in
 lastand i rode a horse called old blue combe the rev john fennie did hold that belonged to andy gilmour
 i won services in the old log school down by a race with him that day the slough i was
 at the presbyterian the nichol boys jim and jack church the night the reverend mathew shipped in a lot of
 dogies from manitoba preached his first sermon there the skim milk calves and yearlings of the text was what does
 it profit a man milk breeds practically all steers the if he gain the whole world and lose his nichol
 boys were located at the north own soul or what shall a man give end of standishen lake but andy
 stayed in exchange for his soul the reverin lacombe he had jack ford with him end mathew was all right
 to keep track of the cattle the reynolds people came into la bob page a rancher of pine lake combe
 in 1895 from dakota they bought 500 head of these dogies and brought in some of the first heavy horses
 in the locality percheron mares of good elliot s harness shop and they helpec weight and quality later they moved
 me decorate my horse my grandmothei out to land south of where the village would have been vastly pleased i
 had of clive is located and roy reynolds a good horse as usual and rode in the still holds the
 original homestead ned lead with the colonel a wonder they barnett had a bit of land under cultiva didn t
 shoot me they should have 1 tion just north of the townsite which was not very popular for some time
 after mr reynolds farmed while living in but the pioneers were wonderful people laconibe and soon forgave me i n
 tice came from dakota with the my people had the north east quarter reynolds people and built a livery and
 section to the south my father plowed feed stable on bannett avenue west of 40 acres of land and built
 a house there the old merchants bank when the in 1893 and more land was broken in town of stettlen
 was starting to build the following year the first wheat j n went into the livery business there grown was
 frozen badly it wouldn t be leaving the lacombe stables to his son considered good feed these days but in
 law john fortune my father had me take 40 bushels to one 12 th of july they had an orange
 edmonton to the grist mill by team and men s picnic at jack barnett s lake wagon there was a
 small flour mill where the adventists academy now at the foot of the hill somewhere near stands the gathering of
 the people the low level bridge on the north side was made at lacombe and i believe of the riven
 but there was no bridge nearly every soul for 50 miles around and i crossed the river on the ferry
 was there they formed a procession the miller told me when i arrived that with col gregory on a milk
 white he had all the wheat he could grind in steed representing king william in the three months so i
 hauled it back across the river and down the trail to the little lead his horse was covered with blue
 velvet and gold braid while the colonel pipestone creek five miles north of wetaskiwin where there was another had a
 red coat white breaches and tall black boots and he wore as much gold small mill i left the wheat
 there as braid as his horse orange ribbons the miller said it would be a couple were everywhere on the
 bridles of the of months before he could get to it horses and on the whips in the buggies when
 we got the flour eventually it all a flutter in the breeze was black as a crow and when baked
 it was hard as a rock we traded most i had one irish grandmother and i of it to old
 scanfaced charlie a hobremember how she wore the green rib bema indian a sack of flour for a caybons and
 seemed so proud of them to use he traded it to other indians on me it did seem a shame
 not one not the reserve even a little green ribbon on display anywhere i just had two bits but i
 percy switzer was one of the early went into m j macleod s stone and settlers he was half a
 mile south of asked mac what a green ribbon would our place on the opposite side of the cost mac
 said green ribbon is cheap road percy was a good farmer and a today it doesn t seem much in
 de grand neighbor he started out with mand i put my two bits on the coun two on three little
 old cayuses and a ten and asked for as much ribbon as it walking plow looking back now after would
 buy seeing the powerful machinery in these days it doesn t seem possible that so a man standing near said
 boy what much could have been accomplished would you do with a green ribbon on with so little a day
 like this i explained about my grandmother and he said put your it took all winter to cut and haul
 money in your pocket your grandmother enough posts to fence a quarter section shall have her ribbon another man of
 land tamarack posts were used stepped up and said i d like to buy mostly two driven in the ground
 side your grandmother some ribbon too by side the bottom rail laid in a block they bought a bolt of
 three inch satin a foot long on end between the posts ribbon and we went out back of billy green
 willow branches were laced in 26 and out above each higher rail instead came less prevalent heavier horses of wire
 and it was marvelous how and bigger machines did away with strong such a fence was when the wil much
 hand labor ned barnett place lows set and dried money was scarce on the edmonton trail just north of few
 had much and so many had little lacombe was likely the first land or none not many of the early
 settlers plowed reaped the reward that would have been commensurate with their privations and there were no banks in the
 nineties labor the man who homesteaded the few owned their land outright few quarter section where the buildings of homesteads
 were patented and c p r the heatherbrook stock farms are sold and hudson s bay land was usually it
 to w s mooney for 600 many bought on long term agreement as a who could gather enough together left
 consequence few had security for loan the country but others who were too dances were frequently held in homepoor to
 leave lived through to more steaders log cabins a collection being prosperous times taken up to pay the musicians two
 bits was the usual amount collected as more land came under cultivation from the men and the ladies brought roads
 and drains opened up frost be cake or sandwiches oil pioneer william aidnidge who was the first man to discover
 petroleum in alberta was a caller at the world office to day mr aldridge took up his first claim in
 august 1899 this was in southern alberta about 40 miles from pincher creek that year he took out about 30
 gallons of oil which he distributed as samples in bottles to any who were interested the following spring he was
 approached by seattle parties but as at that time he had not his title completed the deal was not consumated
 that year he had a government survey made at a cost of 300 his first means of gathering the oil
 was somewhat crude he built a sluice box and shoveled the oil saturated gravel into it he says it looked
 for all the world as if someone had poured black molasses over the gravel at the end of the sluice
 was water as the oil trickled out it would remain on top of the water mr aldridge would then drop
 an oat sack on top of the water and when it had taken up the oil he would strip it
 into a boiler which he had packed in with infinite difficulty when he had enough he would boil it to
 drive out the water then he put it into coal oil cans which in turn he had to pack 10
 miles before he could put them on a wagon he then took it to cardston where he sold it for
 1 a gallon even by these crude methods he was able to gather about 50 gallons a day mr aldridge
 tried several methods of putting a shaft down through the putty like clay surface thinking he would get more oil
 in the gravel below three attempts at this were not very successful mr aldnidge had built three miles of road
 before the rocky mountain development company came into the country this company in spite of mr aldnidge s protests insisted
 on putting up a derrick on his section no 29 though he showed them his lines and stakes and their
 own section was 30 they bored 1020 feet and got flowing oil afterwards they got their tools stuck in the
 hole and abandoned the bone for two months the government sent an inspector to look oven what mr aldnidge had
 done on his land the oil was coming in paying quantities all along there the oil was oozing out along
 the banks of the creek shortly after this mn ferguson and mr trethewey took the matter up with mr aidnidge
 and closed a deal for the property which is now held by the western oil coal consolidated of which mr
 j b ferguson of this city is manager this company is now putting down two bores on the property and
 the experience of mn aldridge and the results from the other company s bore would indicate that success is assured
