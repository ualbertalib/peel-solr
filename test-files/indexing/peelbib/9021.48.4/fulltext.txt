 co who status and bier ‘ v by kristi benson the image of the stetson wearing cowboy singing softly to
 his herd at night is a romantic yet somewhat unrealistic picture of the glorious past of south western alberta s
 cattlemen for example several years ago calgary celebrated the year of the cowboy a commemoration of that tough freespirited yet
 fair to a fault breed who helped to shape western society as we know it calgarians participated heartily in these
 affairs and went to some length to associate themselves with this image of frontier spirit freedom and industriousness however the
 cowboy of alberta s early large corporate ranches does not fit so easily into this present day mold these men
 were part of the staff of huge ranches with holdings of hundreds of thousands of acres owned by groups of
 wealthy elites and businessmen who themselves resided in eastern canada or britain quite separate from a popular conception of rangeland
 equality social inequity of some degree structured the lives of these men as well as the other people living on
 ranches this research is an attempt to understand this hierarchy and its manifestation in the day to day activities and
 living arrangements of the people who populated the large early corporate south western alberta ranches ys and cattle barons archy

 time demonstrated by an examination of holding a position of authority a gosalaries residence task allocation and between of sorts
 business relationships of each of these groups the relationship between the cook and the rest of the ranch population was
 owners generally did not reside upon complex on the round ups the cook their ranches in fact several individuals could
 wield considerable power or corporations were usually joint permitting some cowboys to sleep by owners investors their decisions and the
 stove and some not as well as the reality of their ownership obviously supplying a very important necessity played a
 role in the running of the food however on the home front at the ranches as did their occasional visits

 manager occasionally an chinese or african canadian backinvestor who was the apex of authority ground and these racial and ethnic
 present he dealt with every aspect of differences inevitably added to the ranch life there was a general tendency complexity
 of status relations as for for senior management to be eastern their pay this could vary with the ranch canadian
 or british whereas the and the cook s experience for example cowboys were to a greater proportion frank white treasurer

 were well paid fred as cook till further notice while stimson manager of the bar u ranch another nian was

 of the bow river ranch his salary was 2 500 plus sonic cowboys earned 40 to 45 per a house

 little as a dollar a day 2 their wages the cochraiic ranche earning 2 000 a were the most variable

 ranch in henderson s northwest brand book of 894 the entry lists owners range ciiid b ands the manager s
 house was physically apart from the bunkhouse and on some ranches like the bar u it was separated by quite
 a distance this emphasized and reinforced the division between the groups based upon status and hierarchy some managers like fred
 stimson of the bar u ranch 7 and the springetts on the walrond 5 had servants and family retainers in
 their households and a house that may have been simple and unobtrusive on the outside was a victorian wonder on
 the inside similarly the cochrane ranche manager s house was a lovely structure filled with expensive ceramics and bottles indicating
 a liquor consumption pattern quite different than that of the cowboys there were wines and liquor bottles at the manager
 s house and screw top soft drink bottles predominating at the bunkhouse furthermore the use of alcohol by cowboys at
 most ranches was strictly forbidden while such restrictions did not apply to the manager evelyn springett noted that her house
 was a small one story affair but went on to mention that they had a kitchen pantry maid s bedroom
 and a nursery 2 outside of their small house they kept a variety of fowl which included peacocks frequently the
 foreman and his wife if present also had a house of their own elizabeth lane wife of the original bar
 u foreman mentioned we lived in a log house built for us 2 however not all foremen were that fortunate
 the bunkhouse for the cowboys on the cochrane ranche was similar to a barracks constructed with several storage rooms a
 kitchen and communal dining room as well as four bedrooms these would have been occupied by at least four men
 indicating that they shared living spaces to a certain degree at the bar u ranch all the cowboys slept upstairs
 in one communal room and ate downstairs in another 24 ann clifford wife of a long time bar u ranch
 specialists receiving more than the runof the mill cowboy a broncho buster might receive 75 per month 3 while up
 to 100 was paid to men who had proved their worth 4 at the bottom of the ranching pay scale
 were the casual labourers who received 25 a month cutting hay and performing other menial tasks ‘ as noted by
 the wife of the walrond ranche s foreman evelyn springett patterns of residence were also indicative of varying positions on
 the ranch she stated the place where the men lived was quite separate from our establishment and consisted of a
 low flat roofed log building whitewashed within and without it was distinctly primitive and had no modern sanitary arrangements but
 for that matter neither had we a married couple lived at the shack but they were under the manager s
 orders the man was a sort of a general factotum and the woman did the cooking for the cowboys there
 was a room also for the foreman and a large commonroom with six or eight wooden frames for beds above
 one of the onerous duties of the cowboy was to cut hay as seen in this 1893 view likely on
 the wa rand ranch sometimes this work was done by casual labourers right this romanticized view shows a group of
 cowboys riding along stephen avenue in calgary during the riel rebellion of 1885 this sketch by j d white probably
 represents a cowboy militia group fl alberta history i autumn 2000 the crew the foremen had an intricate knowledge of
 cattle cowboys and how to make them work best with each other sometimes a foreman just as he could move
 up from being a cowboy could move on to start his own spread although foremen occupied the place between the
 manager and the cowboys this did not prevent direct communication taking place between the two groups usually however foremen interpreted
 orders from the managers and put them into effect lower level management positions such as treasurers did not slot into
 the ranch hierarchy as easily as did cowboys and foremen like the cook they occupied a place on the hierarchical
 ladder but they were not just another rung they might have had authority in some matters for example fred white
 as the treasurer on the cochrane ranche hired most of the men and decided their salaries but he did not
 tell them what to do he had no say in the direct running of the ranch but handled the matters
 of finance relating to the purchase and sale of the cattle and the signing of contracts necessary for the running
 of a successful ranch his position necessitated a very mobile lifestyle and as white noted in his diary almost every
 week he was in a alberta history i autumn 2000 manager raymond clifford remembered that the beds were two byfours
 nailed together to form a rectangle about the size of a single bed and fresh hay was used as the
 mattresses the cook had his own room in the bunkhouse as well as his her own privy clifford mentioned that
 the cook had a better bathroom arrangement than the cowboys who had to use the barn as a toilet and
 throw the dung on the manure heap all positions on a ranch were essential ones the cowboys the foremen the
 cooks the managers without any one of these the ranch would not have been functional the cowboys worked with the
 cattle hands on and took care of the base level duties of the ranch these men spent much of their
 time depending on the season out with the stock on roundups calving trailing the stock to market or watching over
 the herd during blizzards and storms roping riding and breaking bronchos were all part of the job and some men
 excelled in one or more fields it was not a vocation which took a lifetime to learn but it was
 one of skill strength and determination in various reminiscences it holds the mystique of religious asceticism nothing but the horses
 a saddle and the rolling prairie covered with cattle in the hierarchy of the ranch the cook was a vital
 necessity and john craig went as far as to say that the cook on a cattle ranch is next to
 the foreman the most important person 26 it was also said that if a ranch had a good cook you
 had a contented crew 22 the foreman interfaced between the manager and the cowboys he was often a more mature
 cowboy himself promoted to this important job after years of experience a captain to the cowboys he acted both as
 one of the men and as an authority dictating who would do which task on which day where the round
 up would start and who would work together respected by some cowboys earned 40 to 45 per month but occasionally
 they were paid as little as a dollar a day their wages were the most variable with skilful specialists receiving
 more than the run of the mill cowboy above top different location with such authority came responsibility and when white
 was this view of the upper walrond leaving his position it was intimated ranch shows dwelling houses at that he
 was in part accountable for the the far left with barns and other heavy losses of cattle during the first
 few outbuildings near the corrals years of ranch operation 25 above bottom as the foremen acted as the go between
 some indication of the hierarchy of a western ranch can be seen for cowboys and the management the the view
 at big hills spring near managers themselves acted as the liaison cochrane at the highest point i s with the
 eastern or british financiers the owner s or manager s house this position was not an easy one nor while
 below close to the corrals one in which many men were successful is the bunkhouse this ranch they had to
 deal with the effectiveness supplied milk to calgary of all the employees of the ranch from the chore boys to
 treasurers few people were outside of their range of authority 2 it was the manager s responsibility to see that
 the ranch was profitable and well run producing good stock and procuring a paying market for them they had to
 perform equally as well in the fine homes of montreal as they did in the saddle barns of the west
 one successful example was fred stinison manager of the bar u ranch for about twenty years he assured investors of
 which he was one of a tidy profit while earning a reputation as a western raconteur and prankster stimson kept
 an eye on the changing situation in canada s north west territories and implemented a policy of buying deeded land
 when available to avoid the problems with cancellation of leases and the intrusion of homesteaders as well he maintained a
 friendly relationship with the settlers which sometimes was mutually beneficial thus the ranch managers had to articulate between the workers
 and workings of a ranch and the finances and demands of their eastern owners investors they did so within the
 changing judicial and cultural environnient in the loothills of southern alberta it is no surprise that sonic did not succeed
 many eastern or british managers who were appointed by ignorant hut well meaning owners faltered under the stresses in this
 new way of lil e nor is it surprising that semi literate cowboys with little or no management experience did
 not rise to this senior position what social differences existed on early corporate ranches in southern alberta the groups were
 separated vertically into various levels as reflected by their authority pay and size and separateness of their accommodation payment of
 employees ranged from 25 to 250 per month depending on their position or their status this is a substantial difference
 comparable to the gap today between a person earning minimum wage and an office manager the best alberta history i
 autumn 2000 paid position that of manager coincides with the finest quality of residence managers lived in their own houses
 nicely decorated while foremen might have had a house or may have shared the common bunkhouse with the cowboys thsk
 allocation also follows a pattern but is not as definitive as salaries or accommodation for example managers might ride with
 the cowboys from time to time although this was unusual in practise the managers had authority over the foremen and
 the cowboys while the foremen had authority over the cowboys and the chore boys the position of cook does not
 lit easily into the vertical ladder although the pay and authority indicates a close relationship to the working cowboy managers
 and treasurers dealt with numbers people and marketing today such tasks are parts of high paying and high status office
 positions cowboys and foremen on the other end of the scale worked with the practical aspects of cattle management and
 their lives were characterized by manual labour racial and national differences may have exacerbated the spread between the groups as
 the upper levels were more likely to be british or eastern canadians while the lower positions were filled with americans
 or cowhands who eagerly adopted an american persona 3 an active debate has emerged in the last few decades concerning
 the nature and inception of ranching in south western alberta lewis g thomas proposed that ranching in the south western
 portion of alberta was a gentile operation where english traditions and a leisurely way of life predominated 32 some smaller
 ranchers and american cowboys may not have been able to enjoy the same pursuits hut in general ranching was typified
 by a gentleperson s elitist life of reasonably hard work and reasonably refined play although as simon evans states canadian
 historiography has tacitly assumed that cowboys in alberta i were mostly americans 33 historians in the i 970 s made
 a strong case that indeed there was a great difference between the american frontier and that of canada 4 they
 noted that those settling in the canadian west were very different in character from those who had moved at an
 earlier date into the western united states also settlement took place in western canada over a very short period of
 time within a context of established authority of the north west mounted police and other government institutions and led by
 a group who were confident and content with their own cultural traditions and social structure some historians such as david
 breen state that the influence of american cowboys was restricted to the few american foremen and cowboys whose duties were
 confined mainly to the physical management of cattle thomas s victorian transplant model does not go unchallenged 6 those identified
 as american diffusionists charge that one should not overlook the effects that environmental materialistic day to day restrictions placed on
 leisurely frontier living 7 both groups acknowledge various influences derived from english cultural traditions canadian law enforcement bodies and american
 cowboying but it is the degree to which these influences affected the overall nature of the ranch which is undecided
 neither the victorian transplant nor the american diffusion theory adequately explains the relationships reflected by salary scales accommodation and general
 duties of individual ranch employees the introduction of british mores does not explain the variety in cowboys wages nor the
 importance of the round up cook 6 and although it is true that cowboys were occasionally referred in a derogatory
 manner such as things to sell or as inmates 4 managers realized the importance of a good cowboy for the
 smooth running of their ranches and were willing to pay accordingly especially in times of labour shortages nor does either

 this does not diminish the solid evidence of status differences based on social groupings this research has focussed on the
 practical aspects of cattle ranching the buying handling and selling of cattle however there were people on the ranch who
 did not have a direct role in this part of ranching these include ranchers wives maids and other domestic servants
 school teachers children blacksmiths and more they had their own unique place in ranch life a role they played as
 part of the ranch population other groups also played an important part in the social history of the area for
 example the north west mounted police were a part of ranch life and occasionally had posts on ranches while indians
 such as the stoneys were often hired on the bar u and brought an ethnic diversity to the ranch social
 hierarchy based upon authority experience ethnicity and position obviously existed on early corporate albertan ranches however this research brings up
 more questions about the nature of life on these cow camps how did status designations affect those who were assigned
 them how did they manipulate these roles oppose them codify them reproduce them and how did the people who were
 nonessential in the management of cattle fit into the equation as usual the response to one question has resulted in
 many more questions being posed the cowboys singing softly to his herd was a part of a much more complex
 equation than one might suspect today argument capture the lived experience of these groups the cowboy often felt superior to
 the english managers who in many cases bungled ranch affairs disastrously cowboys revered the free life which working for ranches
 allowed them and make claims of having no desire to do anything else 4 the more civilized easterners sometimes considered
 the cowboy a dirty uneducated oaf who only enjoyed shooting his pistol and drinking whisky both groups however probably recognized
 the integral nature and complementarity of their different positions on the ranch what evolved was a working system based upon
 a division of labour and a hierarchy of residence authority and pay some groups were peripheral to the authority hierarchy
 such as cooks and lower level management they nonetheless were important in the social fabric and operations of the ranch
 status and hierarchy on ranches thus displays evidence of a social syncretism american and eastern british styles of living and
 working were combined into a system where both could feel superior above the elite of the ranching industry were able

 life aibe ‘ mounted police ja ‘ 2 4 ‘ played an important role by ensuring the criminal justice system
 a degree of 0 if continuity as commissioner a bowen 4 by perry concluded in his 1912 report when the
 newj provinces were d a v i d b r i g h t formed it was necessary to carry
 on the u ti 1 west viii system then in force until they had time to erect the necessary buildings
 the annual reports of the rnwmp thus over the past two or three decades provide a coherent and reasonably historians
 have thrown considerable consistent record of the problems laced light on the operation of the criminal by alberta s penal
 system justice system in western canada numerous studies have been published when alberta was officially declared a on the development
 of the law the legal province in 1905 the mounted police and social functions of police forces had already been
 policing the region for notably the royal north west mounted more than thirty years it made sense police rnwmp and
 the incidence therefore that it should continue this and significance of various criminal i ole until the new government had
 set up offences however there has been institutions to assume some of the relatively little attention paid to the more
 responsibility within a few years mundane background functions of the however it became clear to those in justice system such
 as the daily command of the rnwmp that this operation of the jails themselves given informal arrangement presented a the
 cun ent debate over the effectiveness number of problems in 1912 for of incarceration as a form of punishment example
 the mounted police were or rehabilitation and the problems responsible for the care of almost l our associated with a
 growing prison thousand prisoners and in his report for population it might be useful to that year perry listed three
 main reasons consider such questions in the light of why this was a duty which we ought historical perspective not
 to bear first he pointed to the perennial problem of overcrowding this paper is a tentative exploration of second he
 cited the inadequate structure jail room activity in alberta in the years and facilities of the jails themselves 1905 to
 1914 it focuses mainly on the they are unsuited for the detention of guard rooms at the five provincial prisoners
 he wrote as they are rnwmp divisional posts wooden buildings liable to be destroyed lethbridge fort macleod calgary fort by
 fire some are without proper sanitary saskatchewan and peace river during arrangements and all are so arranged as the time
 that alberta made the transition not to allow for the proper division of from district to province the rnwmp prisoners
 finally perry complained alberta history i autumn 2000 rtas fails 19 o 4914 that using his officers to look after
 the jails diverted from their proper police duties and that nothing was so obnoxious to our young constables as prison
 duty this was not the first time that perry had made such comments nor that he concluded that the question
 of jail accommodation is a s e r ious one and calls for prompt attention 5 yet on the eve
 of world war one these problems persisted and continued to serve as a source of much frustration for perry and
 other commanding officers overcrowding was the number one problem faced by mounted police guard room jails and t o an
 ex t en t i t was the source of all other difficulties the rapid growth of alberta s population
 in the pre war years from 73 000 in 1901 to 374 000 by 1911 was accompanied b y an
 increase in crime and criminal prosecutions in turn this inevitably placed new pressure on institutions that had barely sufficed in
 the frontier period 6 in calgary for example the average daily number of prisoners held at the mounted police guard
 room jumped from forty one in 1907 to seventy two by 1913 during the same period the corresponding figure at
 lethbridge rose from sixteen to fortythree while at fort macleod it went from fifteen to sixty 7 in that year
 corporal c r peters in charge of the guard room at calgary reported that there are 22 cells which are
 not sufficient for the increased number of prisoners at times there were as many as 49 prisoners supposed to be
 above this view s tows two member r of the royal north west mounted police with their prisoner in the

 at fort saskatchewan jail to be good in addition to such altruism considering the unsanitary condition of overcrowding also raised

 out of manpower relative to the growing at fort saskatchewan necessitating the prison population but also related to the transfer
 of prisoners to the jail at fort generally inadequate physical structure macleod of the prisons themselves this was the second
 major complaint made by beyond the question of health those in commissioner perry in his report for charge of the

 buildings are in first class repair overcrowding was the number one problem faced by mounted police guard room jails and
 to an extent it was the source of all other difficulties in calgary for example the average daily number of
 prisoners held at the mounted police guard room jumped from 41 in 1907 to 72 by 1913 alberta history i

 still used as short without the efforts of women like places of detention for prisoners mrs stuttaford it is difficult
 to imagine 5 268 were received during the year how alberta s under resourced and our accommodation is entirely overcrowded
 jails could have performed inadequate and has been for many as well as they did under the years the only
 modern guard room circumstances is at edmonton erected this year it was only intended as a place of despite this

 impact that police duties erected many years ago are without were having on their male employees proper facilities for classifying

 short respect 8 sentences ottawa heeded these concerns to some at first this plan seemed to work with extent by
 awarding an additional superintendent ross cuthbert of twenty five cents to the pay of escorts edmonton reporting the situation there
 but still the greater problem was the very much relieved by september necessity of having to perform such 1911 yet
 within a year of opening the work at all desertions and other provincial jail itself had become breaches of discipline
 became more overcrowded with inmates as cuthbert frequent over time perhaps as a result sadly reported in 1912 the completion
 and commanding officers voiced fears of the provincial jail at lethbridge has that the rnwmp s prison duties might not
 lessened the number of our inspector wilson remarked that ‘ as there is only one bed in each cell it
 is hardly right to have men sleeping on the floor especially in winter and i would recommend the purchase of
 made mattresses for prison use alberta history i autumn 2000 prisoners it has apparently only accommodated the increase of prisoners
 over last year 2 in other words at best it represented a one time reduction of the prison population at
 the mounted police guard rooms leaving them to deal with future admissions as best they could worse yet by 1914
 prisoners were actually being transferred out of the overcrowded provincial jail to places such as fort macleod at the same
 time the province took over the guard room at fort saskatchewan to be used as a second provincial jail leaving
 the mounted police fort in edmonton to act as merely a receiving and distributing point for prisoners 2 elsewhere guardrooms
 at lethbridge calgary fort macleod and peace river continued to serve as common jails complete with all the problems they
 had faced during the previous decade no solution to these problems was found in the years before the war overcrowding
 inadequate facilities and demoralization among the mounted police rank and file persisted the outbreak of war itself presented an opportunity
 for some relief in part due to the canadian state s willingness to clamp down more stringently and with greater
 resources on those who undermined or threatened to undermine the nation s war effort the number of prisoners passing through
 the guardroom of late has been very small observed edmonton s superintendent ta wroughton in september 1915 owing to the
 fact that work has been more plentiful and that the city police are sending their short sentence prisoners to the
 city farm 22 despite such apparent improvements the fundamentals still applied a year after the war began f j hori
 igan in calgary recorded that the storeroom off the guard room was converted into a place suitable for female prisoners
 the cupboards and shelves being torn out and two steel cells wash basin and lavatory installed the room is well
 ventilated and daylight is admitted through two large windows making it all that could be desired 23 that horrigan could
 make this last remark with no hint of irony or sarcasm is a revealing comment on the enduring nature of
 the problems that beset alberta s jails during the province s first decade there was to be no magic solution
 to these problems 24 overcrowding inadequate facilities and job dissatisfaction continued to plague alberta s jails throughout the 20 th
 century and remain the case even today newly built correctional facilities soon become overcrowded and doublebunking is common practice secure
 buildings have replaced the earlier wooden jails but issues of hygiene continue to be a concern especially in the context
 of sexually transmitted disease aids and the sharing of needles among inmates finally the correctional officers may have replaced the
 mountie but during times of job action it is the men in scarlet who return to their historical task of
 overseeing alberta s prisoners 25 above like other mounted police jails the guard hou ve in calgary seen here about

 in a ceremony attended by one of the largest crowds ever in spirit river dr e j m church of
 the alberta department of education read an inspector s report filed february 27 1945 which described miss henderson as follows
 by carrying on during the dark days of the depression in the thirties she made a great contribution to the
 community her work in the classroom has always been of exceptionally high order as the years went by her efficiency
 increased rather than diminished it is an honour for me to pay highest tribute to a teacher who has given
 her life unselfishly to the education and advancement of the community jessie margaret 0 henderson was born at union road
 lot 33 near charlottetown prince edward island on july 4 1881 she was the eldest child of dr james henderson
 and his wife annie gregor and was one of five daughters above thi v is a view of spirit river

 there she attended the regina normal school in 1902 03 receiving her primary teaching certificate on december 30 1903 the
 regina normal souveiiim published by the students gave her high praise judging from the lessons miss henderson has taught at
 normal the three years of teaching in p e i must have been very successful 3 miss henderson taught for
 a shoi t time in what is now the province of saskatchewan then moved to alberta before it became a
 province for the next few years she taught in the crowsnest pass area in canmore and in tofleld before going
 to spirit river she did not like the ci owsnest pass area she hated the wind but remembei ed mrs
 raskivitch as being very good to me when i was in bellevue 4 in canmore miss henderson shared a house
 with another teacher whom she called crowe and an office secretary named travers both of whom simply called her henderson
 the three enjoyed living together often welcoming other people for dinner going to skating parties and attending local dances after
 a time each of them wanted to explore other places crowe going to vancouver area to teach and later to
 seattle travers finding a job as legal secretary to a lawyer named sandecock in drumhcller and henderson going to tofield

 a member of the p e i legislative council in 1863 and served on the executive council until 1866 he
 was then elected to the house of assembly holding this position for four years after which he retired from public
 life 2 miss henderson s father james also studied medicine and set up a medical practice at beach hill p
 e 1 immediately after graduating in 1 879 he married annie gregor a school teacher from charlottetown except for four
 years in california dr henderson practised in beach hill until his retirement with this family background it is not surprising
 that jessie margaret henderson decided to pursue a career in education she received her basic education in prince edward island
 completing her studies at the prince of wales college in charlottetown she then taught for three years in prince edward
 island before moving west to miss henderson s adventuresome spirit next took her to the old spirit river settlement what

 her classroom one of her students and a neighbour olive boorman nee holmberg remembers her with fondness and affection she
 and her sister and two brothers always called her auntie hen but never in a school situation she recalled miss
 henderson kept encouraging both travers and crowe to get jobs in spirit river or nearby towns just as travers was
 thinking of going to spirit river many returned soldiers were looking for work so jobs were not as plentiful as
 before there were still lots of schools but they were in the peace river area to entice her two friends
 to come north she said the boys here are gentlemen unlike the mountain boys 7 miss henderson had a great
 many friends she invited sam boynton and mary johnston for supper one evening but had only one knife and one
 fork for her guests afterwards they attended a dance for miss henderson loved to dance although she disliked pairing off
 the more there were to dance with the happier she was if an extra musician was needed she often played
 the piano occasionally being given five dollars for her efforts after the dance was over she and her friends had
 a big meal at charley wing s restaurant in town one after another of her friends invited her for supper
 either at a restaurant or out to their home in the country on weekends where there were often other invited
 guests in a letter to travers dated may 21 1919 she says i may not be in calgary for july
 1 after all the brinkmans are getting up a party to go to hudson hope go by boat from dunvegan
 return on a raft take tents like every protestant family in spirit river we had miss henderson for a teacher
 in the earl y grades i bet she hardly ever missed a day either and at school it was not
 auntie hen but a proper miss henderson no matter what your family s connection with her was i don t
 think anyone was familiar with her and i m pretty sure that the children of the town never called her
 auntie hen to her face once they had her for a teacher everyone had a lot of respect for her
 she was strict in school didn t play favourites was always kind but not in the least sentimental in manner
 and kept a tight rein on the classes using the strap whenever she felt it was called for i remain
 thankful to her for several things that happened to me in her class one was that i could read in
 those days when one room had to accommodate several grades i thank her for choosing to read aloud the inspiring
 tales of the lives of explorers and discoverers so that lowly grade ones could hear installing a taste for world
 history geography and social studies that would be reinforced in later grades 9 another of miss henderson s students kay
 moravec arndt has particular memories of her musical abilities and of how she treated her students miss henderson wore a
 large gold ring with gold nuggets mounted on it and if we were doing something we below this is the
 public school in canmore where jessie henderson taught before moving to spirit river in 1916 alberta history i autumn 2000

 suffer fools gladly jolly the school janitor as director and i heard her say impatiently when we had a great
 time some arguments had come up between the anglican and the united church that i also remember festival days when
 ‘ if jesus christ himself came down and you d get to meet all the kids from the sat in
 the pulpits of either of the neighbouring school districts and protestant churches in this town we d wait anxiously for
 our turn to he d be criticized she did not like perform on stage in the masonic and pretentiousness and

 activities as sending her ingenuity to provide art supplies for clothes and food parcels overseas she her class she would

 going on in the musselshell country in montana it is no less than a horse thief round up the cowboys
 round up the country get the thieves con ailed and the only branding they get is the mark of a
 hemp rope around the necktie portion of their physiological structure people are apt to look upon these hanging matinees with
 a sort of holy horror and point with pride to the canadian north west as being particularly free from any
 such lawlessness so it is because since its first settlement the class of desperate characters which almost invariably infest the
 western states have not been able to get a footing necktie parties are not often resorted to even in the
 states except when the ordinary machinery of justice fails to reach the criminals if the law were so loosely administered
 here as it is in sonic of the western states our impression is that the speedy elevation of such gentlemen
 as horse and cattle thieves when and where found is most wholesome antidote for the pest pot mw cod gazette
 sept 5 1884 alberta history i autumn 2000 editor s note during the depression of 1894 the spokane area was
 in a state of unrest the great northern railway line had just been completed to the pacific coast but was
 tied up by recurring snowslides and washouts railway employees were on strike tying up the lines and coxely s army
 of unemployed was gathered in spokane making ready for a march to washington the whole country was in turmoil john
 bethune ross a telegraph operator found himself without employment because of the unrest so he decided to visit his relatives
 in edmonton by way of a wagon trail friends tried to dissuade him but accompanied by his wife who was
 in poor health his mother in law aged sixty six and his wife s two brothers he set off on
 may 29 1894 for the long trek to the canadian north west most of their journey followed the routes of
 today s major highways they went from spokane to coeur d alene and missoula on the route of today s
 1 90 east at garrison to helena on today s highway 12 north to wolf creek on 1 15 then
 through choteau and browning to cardston from there they followed approximately today s highway 2 to edmonton ross s account
 follows i had considerable experience with horses in the early eighties while campaigning against louis rid in the rebellion so
 we decided to use three wagons two heavy ones and a light spring covered one and three good teams of
 horses our route lay through the spokane valley to coeur d alene and when we arrived at that point we
 found the town flooded and the military post fort sherman under water this was our initial experience with flooded trails
 washed out mountain roads muskeg and a dozen other difficulties but although we were advised time and time again to
 return to spokane we were determined to get through we soon found that the trail from coeur d alene had
 been washed out by the flood and after waiting for ten days for the waters to subside we were ferried
 across the twenty miles of lake water one wagon toppled backwards into the lake upon landing but it was salvaged
 and the contents dried out our route then took us through the big mining towns of wallace and mullan by
 john bethune ross alberta history i autumn 2000 above these three wagons are seen entering southern alberta about the same
 time that john ross and family made their arduous 1894 trek from spokane to edmonton idaho and it was while
 nearing the here that another disturbing event former town on what was known as the occurred when half way up
 the seven mile hill that we narrowly mountainside we saw a man coming escaped disaster when we met another down
 the trail riding a fractious horse four horse team coming down the just as he reached our four horse team
 narrow hill there was only inches to he suddenly reared and his rider spare but we managed to squeeze by
 disappeared over the side we found him without mishap clinging to a bush fifty feet below the roadway and lowering
 a rope we hauled we travelled over range after range of him up to safety outside of bruises and mountains
 fording streams of rushing shock he had escaped injury water and slush one morning we came upon two swedish prospectors
 who had as we descended the other side of the just killed a large cougar these men mountain we saw
 the montana boundary strongly advised us to turn back but in the distance we travelled along the when we told
 them that we were st regis river for miles crossing it and determined to finish the trip they recrossing it
 many times we finally decided to accompany us reached the missoula river where we saw our first settlers a family
 named we found the trail completely frost several days later we arrived at obliterated in many places and were missoula
 montana obliged to travel on the railway where it was not washed out pulling the wagons on our way to
 helena we were over bridges by hand and swimming the approached by three men on horseback horses across the streams
 all arnied to the teeth they asked for chewing tobacco but when we told them early in june we arrived
 at the most we hadn t any the leader snorted difficult spot on the whole trip we bunch of tenderfeet
 and galloped found that the trail lay along a shale away two days later when we reached bank along a
 raging river with the trail bearmouth station on the northern sloping toward the river and very pacific railway we were
 informed that narrow we were compelled to stick a the passenger train had been held up and long pole through
 the side of the wagon robbed by three bandits several days and all hands then swung the wagon before we
 were quite sure that the three inward while the horses picked their way men who we had met on the
 trail were up the bank it was a somewhat trying the bandits experience but we got over safely our route
 then took us to drummond soon afterwards we reached a hill deer lodge and back to the northern called the
 camel s hump and for a time pacific railway crossing over the we thought it was impossible to ascend blossburg
 tunnel and east to helena we in addition to being very steep it was then continued along the montana badly
 washed out on the middle of the central railway to wolf creek in the road from a depth of from
 two to four prickly pear canyon thirty miles west feet we put four horses to each wagon of great falls
 and after hours of toil we finally reached the summit dead tired but vastly we experienced a dangerous river relieved
 in the knowledge that another crossing at choteau a town on the sun difficulty had been successfully met rivei we
 then headed for blackfoot montana which was reached after we made camp in a valley near where fording the marias
 and teton rivers we the trail ascended the divide the reached the international boi der without mountain which is the
 dividing line mishap and crossed into canada in between idaho and montana and it was company with a cowboy named
 ted we reached the international border without mishap and crossed into canada in company with a cowboy named ted ryan
 who was on his way to macleod we were inspected by the north west mounted police at st mary s
 river dalberta history i autumn 2000 ryan who was on his way to macleod and the following day we headed
 for quickly the following day after paying a we were inspected by the north west calgary we camped at willow
 creek couple of half breeds 2 00 to find mounted police at st mary s river and the first night
 high river the next night them our trip from calgary to than later ryan called our attention to and after
 passing high river we met edmonton was uneventful and our the new settlement of mormons at hundreds of indians returning
 from the people were very surprised to see us cardston we made camp on the blood races and sports which
 had been held at when we arrived exactly nine weeks to indian reserve but after a night of calgary the
 day before the day from the time we had left listening to the weird thumping of tom spokane toms and
 the ki yi of the indians we our next camp was a few miles out of were glad to move
 on calgary on the edge of the sarcee this article first appeared in the indian reserve it was here that
 our i calgary herald july 18 1936 we reached macleod that same evening horses disappeared but we secured them immigrants
 to alberta 1910 by john mackenzie to stand on the platform of calgary railway station when an immigrant train is
 coming in is a most interesting experience immediately the train stops there pours out from the ends of the long
 carriages a stream of humanity gathered from all parts of the old world scotch english irish russian dutch etc those
 who have no friends to meet them are naturally somewhat bewildered but all the same their countenances show their relief
 at being at the end of their 3 000 mile railway journey they usually stand around for a few minutes
 to get their bearings and then pick up their grips and leave to look up some resting place for the
 night many of them take advantage of the immigration hall which a paternal government provides after the first night in
 alberta is over and the immigrant has slept off the effects of the railway journey and it takes a good
 sound sleep to do that he gets up and the question of employment naturally recurs a man coming out on
 spec is better to take a job of any sort for the time being than to wait till the job
 he is wanting turns up it is no disgrace for a man to go laboring here the element of snobbery
 has not crept into alberta to any extent yet and it won t do a man any harm while it
 will get him accustomed to the ways of the country the american settler is on a different footing he usually
 comes from a western state where conditions are similar and he is usually a farmer with capital enough to start
 work on a 160 acres or more of his own his effects are more bulky than those of the european
 he carries plows and other farming implements and it usually takes a car or two to hold them this is
 not his first visit to the country in the majority of cases he has been up having a look over
 the country last fall and has his farm located filed and ready to start work right away the british settler
 especially if he has small capital is well advised not to take up land right away he is better to
 work for someone else until he has got a right idea of the country unlike the yankee he finds the
 conditions different calgary albertan july 15 1910 reprint from the rothesay express scotland alberta history i autumn 2000 book revie
