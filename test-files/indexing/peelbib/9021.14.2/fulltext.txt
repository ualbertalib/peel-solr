 indian agent thomas trueman quinn and eight other white men were killed by a group of indians belonging to big
 bear s band of plains cree word quickly spread that the chief long considered by many government officials to be
 the most troublesome indian leader on the canadian prairies had led his people onto the warpath in support of louis
 riel s ill conceived rebellion for years this view was so widely held that even w b cameron a surviving
 witness to the events involving the big bear band and one of the chief s few contemporary defenders found it
 convenient to capitalize on the popular prejudice and publish his personal account of the troubles under the title the war
 trail of big bear more recently however the trend has been to portray the cree chief as a simple old
 man an innocent victim of events he neither understood nor influenced neither portrait does him justice in spite of long
 held misconceptions maybe he had even foreseen the the clatter of rifle fire that accompanied violent finale once some years
 earlier the frog lake massacre proclaimed the when camped on the missouri big bear s end not the beginning of
 big bear s re sleep had been troubled by an ugly sistance to the white man even as the dream
 he saw a spring of water spout old chief rushed forward shouting at up through the ground and when he
 his young men to stop their bloody work tried to stop the flow with his hands the he must have
 realized that his ten year water turned to blood and spouted struggle to prevent the complete sub through his fingers
 on april 2 1885 jugation of his people had been in vain the dream had come true once again mr
 fraser a resident of calgary has made a letailed study of cree band movements particularly during the 1870 90 perioil
 as ijig bear figured prominently during this period mr fraser s studies revealed his un j ortaflt and often misunderstood
 position anwng the cree bands mr fraser also drew the sl eich of big bear at the top of this
 page 1 the chief was unable to stop the flow of of fort carlton at least he was trading blood
 into that fort when he first came to public attention there is even some big bear never planned armed re
 doubt as to his tribal origin once rev sistance to the whites whatever he george mcdougall referred to him as
 a was the cree chief was no fool he was saulteaux and although all other acnot ignorant of the power
 of the white counts identify him as a cree there may man and he knew that the indian had have
 been some justification for the miseverything to lose and nothing to gain sionary s allegation there was a strong by
 fighting unlike louis riel he was saulteaux mixture in all the cree bands neither fanatic nor mystic unlike along the
 north saskatchewan gabriel dumont he was no hot head nevertheless when big bear comes to what and who then was
 big bear the attention of the historian he was what made indian commissioner edgar identified with the river people a
 tribal dewdney call him the most influential division of the plains cree which win indian on the plains was it
 accurate tered along the north saskatchewan to elevate him to such lofty rank when from the elbow west to the
 vermilion his contemporaries included men like river in the summer some bands of crowfoot red crow piapot and pound river

 not formed such a poor opinion of and his family wintered at jackfish lake big bear as some appear to
 have done north of the present city of battleford he is of a very independent character and traded into fort
 canton even then self reliant and appears to know how the cree recognized him as one of their to make
 his own living without begging leading head men and in the large from the government neither of these gatherings on
 the plains he was somemen had reason to err in big bear s times accepted by several bands as head
 favour cameron suffered much at the chief over the entire camp then hands of the chief s followers and around
 1865 big bear moved west and dewdney was charged with the respon began trading into fort pitt there he sibility
 of carrying out a policy that big headed a small band of his relatives bear was attempting to frustrate with
 a permanent following of some in neither appearance nor in dress where around one hundred souls and did big bear
 personify the noble say began to become increasingly important as a plains cree leader age from photographs and descriptions comes
 the picture of a man short at the time big bear moved west of stature with a homely but strong
 face the fort pitt plains cree apparently he affected none of the foppish styles of divided into two broad groups
 one dress popular among the plains indians centred on sweetgrass a chief recognof the day to the contrary he appears
 ized by the hudson s bay company to have shown such a lack of concern while the other gathered around

 equal in recognized as a chief by the hudson s stature to both little pine and piapot bay company indicates
 his position of and as the government was soon to independence from the start he was discover a force to
 be reckoned with no company lackey this did not mean that he was antagonistic to the men of by 1870

 killing company cattle become evident to indian leaders that during a famine in 1872 he put a stop the old
 days of unrestricted freedom to it 3 were coming to an end already the tribes were beginning to be pushed
 west not only was big bear reluctant to ward by the advance guard of civilizaconcede any authority to the company

 and that stand in awe of the metis an example the country was becoming devoid of furof this occured in

 going through big bear s mind at this time there is no because of his reputation for inde way of

 a treaty lowing to take the queen s money prepared for the indians approval the many of the river people
 from the first gathering took place at fort carlton fort pitt area were out on the plains and the loyal
 company chiefs after they had however chosen big bear to making a few petty demands made their go into pitt
 and act as their spokesman x s and s h o o k lieutenant governor and he arrived at the
 fort towards the morris hand however in spite of this close of the proceedings following the good will considerable discontent
 was farewell speeches of sweetgrass and evident the first objections came not keehewin big bear rose and addressed from the
 local chiefs but from a group of the assembly stop stop my friends qu appelle saulteaux who advised he warned
 i heard the governor chief beardy and his willow crees to was to come and i said when i see
 think seriously about the treaty terms him i will make a request that he will before signing their leader nus

 rope to be about my neck it was negotiations at qu appelle two years not given to us by the
 great spirit that earlier made the issue plain when ad the red man or white man should shed dressing morris
 it is true we told each other s blood when big bear them the cree ‘ do not be in

 what you wearing the hudson s bay seal of aphave done you have cheated my kins proval advised him to
 sign saying that men the treaty was good for the indian later poundmaker touched on the people big bear rejected
 their advice same point when he proclaimed this historians have referred to that poris our land it isn t a
 piece of pemmican tion of big bear s speech related to to be cut off and given in little pieces
 hanging it has usually been explained back to us it is ours and we will take as a personal fear
 of execution and acwhat we want but poundmaker in cepted literally as a major reason for the end acted with
 the majority and the chief s refusal to sign the treaty placed his mark on the treaty the however big
 bear was never accused of promise of an immediate feast and the cowardice by any man who knew him distribution
 of a few presents blankets nor did he ever raise the issue again and beads was too much of a
 temptation during the six years that he remained for a people who had little experience outside of the treaty it
 is far more in looking very far into the future plausible to believe that he used this it wasn t
 until the treaty party dramatic example to illustrate the onereached fort pitt that real signs of re sidedness of the
 treaty if the white man sistance appeared first the independ ent chiefs were absent with the majority letter oct 23

 benefit of lieut gov morris but little pine and that hard headed group was addressing his remarks to the of

 not ignorant more than 2 000 allied indians including of the rapid decline of the northern herd the new arrivals
 from the north but his reaction was characteristically different from that of the treaty chiefs later that same year sitting

 several thousand followers into the something better than the complete sub area and for a time attracted most of jugation

 the terms were cept the treaty terms and his acknowlnot satisfactory and asked that the edged leadership of the fort

 he was temporarily plains discouraged but would not have actually left when the time came no one will thunderchild one

 riel was dreaming if he thought he we have saved he cried his voice could get united action from the
 indians tremulous with emotion instead of on short notice all he succeeded in speaking bad about them give them doing
 was stirring up the discontent in back some of the things you have taken the soldier s lodges to the

 at last short of ammunition and wished to take a reservation after food they scattered there was nothing killing quinn
 the indian agent he was left to do but run for the united states afraid and wished to drag the
 others into or surrender so big bear returned to the it why did he kill quinn was it place of
 his youth and surrendered at because quinn was related by marriage fort carlton the wheel of life had to his
 inveterate enemy the lone man turned full circle for the old plains cree possibly quinn had used his influence chief
 to support his in law in a personal quarrel history has turned on pettier big bear was tried for treason
 felony issues and in spite of evidence to the contrary was found guilty prejudice and a corn once started the
 trouble soon got plete misunderstanding of the authority out of hand and all of the indians in the vested in
 an indian chief by his people neighborhood even the peaceful thick were among the reasons another no wood cree were
 drawn in one fact is doubt was the antagonism big bear certain big bear was not involved in had built
 against himself in the white any plot apart from the fact that community and among officials by his violence was
 contrary to his interests refusal to act like a good indian he was absent hunting for several days when he
 was given the opportunity to prior to the outbreak arriving back in speak at his trial it was for his
 people camp only the preceding night when not himself that he pleaded to the he immediately went to bed end
 he remained the unselfish patriot but once the trouble started he re big bear like poundmaker received mained with his
 people he could have a three year sentence to be served in run away to hide in the bush like
 the stony mountain penitentiary while in loyal head man from the red pheasant prison both chiefs accepted baptism into reserve
 but he did not desert his people the roman catholic church under the in their time of trouble besides there
 circumstances the sincerity of these conwas much good that he could do after versions can be doubted but big bear

 prisoners alien government now submitted to an from being killed when the indians alien god once the government got besieged
 fort pitt he was able to ar what it wanted his complete subjurange for the evacuation of the fort gation

 to stir up hate against the prisoners he pleaded caincroji op cit p 229 on their behalf i pity every
 white man cameron op cit p 131 12 along with poundmaker his old band ate that he has attracted so
 little attenwas broken up and scattered so he went tion from historians on to little pine s reserve where in
 1887 riel has become the centre of the he was listed on the annuity sheets as recent interest in the
 western canadian chief but chiefs were nothing now rebellions yet in 1885 riel led his people simply tools of the
 indian department into a madcap bloodbath they could permitted to retain their positions pro never hope to win big bear
 on the vided they pleased the administration other hand was a proponent of the only and furthered the government s
 indian form of protest that could possibly have policy it was no life for big bear so benefitted his people
 passive resisin the winter of 1887 88 with nothing tance his hope was to force concessions left to live for
 he died before the indian became a minority in his own land he was still working to during the long
 history of european effect greater indian unity when the outsettlement of this continent there were break at frog lake shattered
 his plans many conflicts between the natives arid the vengeful violence was not of his the intruders most were the
 result of doing impulsive reaction against injustice planned organized and sustained resis big bear foresaw the humiliating tance was seldom
 achieved of the subjugation of his people and made a indian leaders who succeeded in organi tremendous effort to prevent
 it history zing effective movements only pontiac made his failure almost inevitable tecumseh sitting bull and big bear were but
 left him no honourable alternative involved with canada s history sitting other than the course he took his name bull
 only as a refugee and in the west belongs with those canadians who have only big bear rose to make

 a great indian for the benefit of his race it is unfortun he was also a great canadian fanning in
 jasper pass geo b mclaughlin who returned last week from the tete jaune cache gives a very interesting account of
 the farming operations carried on in the pass by an american trapper named james swift who has made his home
 there for several years past swift is located 18 miles within the pass beyond the site of the jasper house
 and four miles this side of the site of the old henry house he has about 16 acres under cultivation
 fenced in two fields and his crop this year is about 400 bushels of wheat and 60 sacks of potatoes
 besides turnips carrots radishes and a little barley the grain and roots are all of good quality his only imported
 implement is a plow his harrow is home made and in place of a wagon he uses a home made
 sled he has built a mill in which to grind the produce of his farm the grinding apparatus is imported
 and is on the principle of an exaggerated coffee mill he has taken out a ditch and built a water
 wheel by which he secures power to make his mill grind at the rate of about 100 pounds a day
 the wheat is of good sample and is red fife swift has both horses and cattle he winters them chiefly
 on hay and straw but the horses can frequently rustle for themselves all winter in the pass horses also winter
 on prairie creek on the athabasca some distance this side of the pass also at yellowhead lake in the pass
 but on the other side of the summit also at camp mountain on canoe river about thirty miles south east
 of the cache edmonton bulletin nov 13 1899 13 david thompson on the peace river part h edited by hugh
 a dempsey in our last number winter 1966 we carried the first part of david thompson s journal in the
 peace river area this covered the period from nov 5 th 1802 to june 5 th 1803 during most of
 which time he was at a north west company post about five miles up the peace river from its confluence
 with the smoky the xy company an opposition firm had just arrived and was preparing to build a fort a
 short distance away in this number we now reproduce his journal for the period june 5 th to sept 10
 th 1803 during that time thompson made one trip down the peace and explored a portion of the notikewin river
 the remainder of the journal deals with the routine events around the post trading with the beaver indians looking after
 the garden hunting and watching the opposition traders this portion of the journal ends just before thompson left the fort
 for two upriver trips in search of food these trips will be reproduced in a later number of the review
 the journal is being printed with the kind permission of the ontario archives holders of the original documents the spelling
 is unchanged from the original but in some places punctuation has been added for clarity any editor s comments have
 been placed in square brackets biographical or explanatory footnotes given in the last number are not repeated here so information

 critical we how abbott s brother in law our opening ever had lost william and our car for meeting was

 the greatest mine in canada and were shot out into perfect darkness a distance of one thousand feet when we
 reached the work room at the top of the mountain and stepped 4 out of the scoops upon terra firma
 there were two thankful women mrs borden and i had declared the previous evening that nothing would induce us to
 undertake that perilous voyage but like a flock of sheep we followed our leader after the meeting at night we
 drove to the station and found our car and william awaiting us and we started for nelson reaching there the
 following morning the ladies of nelson who were particularly interested in the conservative cause gave us a very pleasant tea
 in the drawing room of our hotel after his election as prime minister mr i wish to make a note
 of the decorations borden visited calgary of several occasions at the opera house same evening the above he i s
 seen conferring with b b bennett nght during a tnp to the alberta city flowers and arrangement of the platform
 being the prettiest that we saw anywhere we embarked on a steamer the sions he said he would have driven

 miles out i felt disappointed when where we boarded our car again at last i found i was so near
 that i could not all of us excepting mr lafurgy who have seen the graves of jessie and her overslept
 and we left him behind us for sister whom we had supported there 24 hours at kootenay landing if you
 in their lifetime could visit the spot you would feel our train moved out and we made certain that the
 m p paid dearly for his the next stop at lethbridge it was only snooze we then travelled through dale
 a distance of forty miles but very tedious and mountain for 24 hours before reach travelling as so much of
 the road is built ing macleod on trestles and you wind in and out and over and back crossing the
 valley which the men were met and taken uptown is in some places 300 feet deep we had where they
 dined and held a meeting the most delayed tea and the worst one while the ladies were delighted to take
 of our trip at the lethbridge hotel i anything that william prepared we suppose the coal miners are not critical
 went out and picked some pretty wild flowers and mrs powell succeeded in friday morning the 19 th of septemcoaxing

 lives mr borden s leg was cut and he was badly shaken up only that a gentleman of our party
 while all in our wagon escaped even in one of the rear carriages called out our driver capt smith who
 was in and requested the ladies to walk over one of the rear carriages told me he the bridge and

 joined servatives of regina had prepared a our party and was now piloting us dinner or supper for the party
 there through the northern district he was seemed a great emnity between mr exceedingly good company very clever bennett and
 mr trant and the former but rather cynical he had been de was inclined to blame the latter for the
 feated in the 1900 election for the house delay of the train which no doubt was of commons so either
