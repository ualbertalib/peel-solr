 its rightful tension of his development plans here ticket to the human history of the area was an ideal location
 for a hotel where the vistas were unsurpassed here was a seven mile long lake within towering mountains its southern

 had to wait for a number of major events to be completed the rise and fall of a proposal to
 build a dam in the area and the end of the first world war not until 1926 did hill s
 idea to build a major hotel in waterton become a reality construction of the 90 room prince of wales hotel

 is that there is no one thing service on waterton lake and what type to warerton townsite then barged down
 that everybody can do not everyone can and style of boat he would recommend the lake and back over the
 internationride horses not everyone can hike over al border to the montana end of the lake the trails only a
 certain percentage of the there he would reassemble the boat people are interested in fishing this plan would also help
 to avoid any although great northern s managers before he contacted swanson noble gave canadian labour problems great northagreed that

 travelling and we had a â€˜ i dakota foot they would all run after him joyful time together one day
 my sister rosa mamie wyoming â€˜ kaufman and i went for a walk there were only prairie trails no hay
 springs and we were about a quarter of graded roads and our route often a mile from camp when we
 heard nebraska was alon g the railroads which were a cow bellowing we looked up the most travelled roads we
 would and saw cattle running towards us stop to feed the horses whenever â€˜ â€˜ as far as we could
 see we raced we found good grass and water as fast as we could to the wagons and also where
 we camped for the nig ht one day the men took a notion to go and they were rig ht
 at our heels that the men would stake one or two horses fishing they staked one horse and turned taught
 us to stay near camp while the other horses stayed at the camp the others loose as usual as they
 never at not many people lived in that wyoming once a week we would stop at a place tempted to
 leave the camp on that day ranching country and houses were from where there was lots of water and mother
 however they got frig htened and took six to ten miles apart alberta history winter 1994 0 when we got
 to yellowstone we saw the we found that the trails were very dim as wagon and leave as soon as
 it gets daygeysers paint pots and the waterfalls and the sand was seven or eight inches deep light for the
 snakes will leave their holes really enjoyed all the beautiful scenery and was very hot even at midnig ht we
 as soon as the sun comes up we got out then we came through idaho where we stopped to feed
 and water the horses and of there as soon as it was possible in the saw lots of sage brush
 i cannot recall just to let them rest and when the dogs played morning some of the snakes came out
 where in idaho there was a forty mile out we had to take them into the wagons when it got
 dayli g hr and the horses didn t desert we had to cross if we didn t it it was
 spooky looking in that desert at like the grass either if the horses had left was a hundred miles around
 the men ni g ht there were trees ten to twelve feet us we would have had to stay in
 our wagenquired about this and were told that it tall and twisted into all shapes and forms ofls all that
 day till night came again was dangerous to cross this desert for everybody was so happy to get through we
 travelled on to pendleton oregon sometimes there were sand storms and and to see green grass at noon the next
 then through baker city to walla walla one could get lost in the storm but they day when we got
 to the other side washington back to the idaho border said if we did go that way to fill every
 we had just camped on the clearwater we found that idaho was irrigation country thing with water for the horses
 and also to river opposite lewiston when my father and we noticed that wherever they farmed take feed so the
 men decided we would took ill so we decided to go back fifthey also had orchards these were the cross
 it for a hundred miles was a long teen miles to uniontown washington first fruit trees us kids had ever
 seen way to go around we were told not to to settle for the winter by this time it start

 out of date and out of touch while they had provided important services to the city of red deer they
 failed to address the concerns of young feminists the quota club was first discussed on november 27 1935 when elizabeth
 white the general secretary of quota club international incorporated came to red deer twenty women attended a meeting she called
 and were sufficiently impressed to organize an informal quota club in february 1936 in march the president of the local
 rotary club spoke to the group on the subject a service club its aims and objects quota modelled irs organization
 on the rotai y club and in jul y 1936 installed officers and officially affiliated the organization with the international
 they began ambitiously assigning their small membership to eight committees a board of directors and to executive positions however the
 responsibilities of service club membership proved to be too much for some women and in january 1937 they decided to
 disband the club because they had fallen below the required fifteen memhers quota international asked the red deer club to
 reconsider its decision and allowed them to continue on an informal basis until their numbers increased the programs of the
 early dinner nicerings consisted of talks given by members or by prominent alberta women including mrs w w rogers and
 irene parlby both members of the alberta legislature s more often meetings were social events for exam ple after a
 talk on spring fashions members had a paper hat contest the minutes stated that mrs 1 undie acted as judge
 of the finished models during a mirth provoking parade the club heard about trips taken by members or red deer
 residents to the 1937 coronation europe south america and the middle east the quota club engaged in some local service
 activities it sponsored raffles in order to raise money for school books and supplies for needy children and for garden
 benches for the local cemetery these social evenings and tentative first steps toward community service failed to sustain the interest
 of quota club members and the club almost disbanded again in september 1941 the local club however found its service
 mission in the war effort meetings provided an opportunity to do knitting or needlework and to send packages to britain
 through the red ci oss the club decided to sponsor a chinese child over seas and participated in projects initiated
 by other clubs they filled bags sent to them b y the lvomen s institute with small gifts for servicemen
 in the navy he quota club also provided wool for the grade x home economics class at the local high
 school so the g irls could contribute something to the war effort red deer experienced a boom during the war
 years the penhold airfield was used by the british commonwealth air training plan and welcomed pilots from britain australia new
 zealand and from all over canada in 1940 construction began on a militia training centre in red deer which was
 turned into a training camp for the royal canadian army service corps in 1941 8 three companies of the canadian
 women s army corps cwac were also stationed in red deer â€˜ i he addition of several thousand people to
 the city resulted in the expansion of local businesses and schools it also provided the impetus for an expansion of
