 neavitt in 1875 it was later published in the canadian illustrated news the fort is situated at the junction of
 weather to be intensely cold and in a bow and elbow rivers on a beautiful few minutes owing to the
 wind the flat or as they say here bottom as air would be as warm as in summer level as
 a cricket ground and of immense extent we are in the midst of although this country i mean the the
 buffalo and the rivers are filled with south western portion of the north west fine mountain trout i have been
 fishing territory is not equal to the saskatcheseveral times lately and really enjoyed wan country for farming i e the
 raising the sport very much a canadian who of grain i have no doubt that in time it has been
 in the habit of catching what will be a great stock raising country we used to call speckled trout can
 and if those men who went into that scarcely fancy them being the size that business in montana can be
 taken as an these fish are here example it takes but little capital to make a commencement by which a
 man the country appears much finer about may soon become independent here than at fort maclead if one can judge
 from the appearance of the soil we have the indians well under conand the fine grass when i came here
 in trol and persons who knew the blackthe early autumn the whole country feet three years ago can scarcely believe
 looked like a magnificent meadow i am it possible they are the same people told though that there are very
 heavy they have the greatest respect for the summer frosts something i think that ‘ soldiers as they all call
 us at one is hardly known at fart maclead which time these indians were the greatest place in my opinion
 so far as climate thieves imaginable no person ever is concerned is the finest part of the thought of leaving
 anything outside of north west the house or lodge even during the day unless it was watched as far travelling
 the winters at fart maclead are un the horses of an outfit as they call daubtedly very much milder than
 in everything here from a single pack manitoba or even on the saskatchewan horse to the largest freight train were
 and unless during occasional severe never safe many and many a man has storms cattle and horses will thrive and
 told me that a traveller in going any live out all winter we have here a distance at one time
 thought he was parwarm south western wind called a ticularly fortunate if he arrived at his chanook which makes a
 great dif destination with his horses in mast cases ference in the climate i have known the he was only
 too glad when the indians h ‘ u 1 qw rs j 24 3 r i came upon him to
 let the horses and the lot of men to do their really hard work rest af the outfit go and
 escape with and duty better than these men and do his life it well tao and cheerfully and willingly it
 seems to me it is their wish they are now the most honest lot of to do everything they can
 to help their people you can possibly fancy or if it is officers on with the work they have to
 not honesty i don t know what it is do to give you an idea of their conduct certainly so
 far as valuable praperty i may tell you that i have not had one of any sort is concerned it
 can be left entry in the defaulter s book since i anywhere with perfect safety the only have been here
 and we have had a lot difficulty is if a man wished to leave of hard and at times disagreeable
 anything for a purpose on the plains an work to do indian would be very apt to bring it to
 the soldiers in fact it is hardly possible we are of course too far from the to lose anything for
 sooner or later it frontier to be bothered by the sioux will be brought to one of the forts about
 whom so much has been said at one time this summer when i was they are of course not quite
 regener at cypress hills i thought they possibly cited yet and mistakes will occur in even the best regulated families
 the might be coming to do some harm but husband and wife or rather wives have they did not i
 have not heard what was those little rows that i understand they going on in that quarter now for some
 time and of course it is impossible for sometimes have in other countries the soldier chief of course is in
 such anyone to say with any certainty what matters called in and becomes for the the sioux may yet do
 it is just one of those matters which you can t most time being a sort of sir creswell cres
 always generally tell well they always willingly submit to any decision given by the police and it our indians here
 are blackfeet crees is the opinion of everyone that unless stoneys bloods and peigans and something extraordinary should occur plenty
 of them there are when i came so long as the indians are fairly and here this autumn there were
 several honorably dealt with in every particular large camps about the fort but just they will behave themselves as they
 now they are off where the buffalo are have done since we came into this i understand about fifteen miles
 from country here col maclead is back again at fort the cold was for this season of the maclead we
 are all delighted to have year severe last week so much so that him as commissioner the rivers were completely
 frozen over but the last three days have been quite the town about this place is not warm the ice
 is completely gone and as large as fort maclead though we the weather is like early summer we have quite
 a settlement we have are taking advantage of the fine weather among other things a fine billiard and getting everything

 time ago it would simply be impossible to get a l n crozier n w m p 16 a poet
 in scarlet by george j crofton when the north west mounted police set out on their great trek across the
 western canadian prairies in 1874 most of them had no idea what lay ahead to them it was a strange
 land filled with wild indians great buffalo herds and loneliness it was a trackless waste so aptly called the great
 lane land one of the men who was in the march was const george j crafton who fancied himself to
 be a poet he was greatly impressed by what he saw and during his first few months in the farce
 he penned a number of poetic lines in a notebook which is now preserved by the glenbow foundation in calgary
 practically nothing is known of crofton he enlisted in the spring of 1874 regimental no 347 but his service records
 apparently were lost in a fire which destroyed many mounted police records in 1897 these poems are not reproduced because
 of their literary quality in fact poetry as such is of no interest to us rather these lines provide a
 personal insight into the feelings of one man on the great trek they indicate loneliness wonderment and to the eternal
 credit of the mounted police a generous amount of humor the editor on viewing the grave of the but paltry

 23 trail to the yukon by cecil denny note in 1905 the royal north west mounted police were assigned the
 task of opening up a route from edmonton to teslin in the yukon territory more precisely they were to establish
 the peace river yukon trail by cutting an eight foot wide route north from fort st john b c so
 that pack animals could be used on a short overland route to the klondike the party left fort saskatchewan on
 march 17 th 1905 with the author a former n w m p inspector in charge of the pack train
 they reached fort st john on june 1 st and by the end of the season they had cut 100
 miles of trail north to a point an halfway river in the winter of 1905 06 they built a temporary
 barracks near fort st john and returned to the task in the spring by fall they had passed fort graham
 and returned to that post for the winter of 190 6 07 but before the onset of cold weather denny
 tired of the task and returned to civilization in 1907 the mounted police party pushed on again cutting the trail
 to a point 100 miles north of hazelton they went to hazelton for the winter but before work could be
 resumed in the spring the entire project had become so impractical that it was abandoned the following are denny s
 own observations as he sent them to friends in calgary during 1905 and 1906 our party left fort saskatchewan on

 summer like spring and we never pitched our tents on the trip the country from the peace river crossing for
 about seventy miles is a we passed many small ranches on beautiful and partly open one the the road mostly
 those of halfbreeds soil is a rich loam with plenty of patches and indians and always procured of wood also
 small streams part of this plenty of baled hay of which there is country is an indian reserve but there
 always a good supply to be procured is a great tract of splendid country a little farming is done and
 in several available for farming and stock raising instances we saw small bands of cattle at these places on the

 of weather was very fine and the trail dry three or faur white men in the stores the trail is
 a good pack one and wagons constitute all of the population have gone over it but long ago so considerable
 fallen timber had to be cut out we camped on the top of the hill and small bridges built over
 bad creeks all supplies having to be brought up on or the road corduroyed pack horses the boat had made
 two trips since we left the crossing and indians were now and then met out brought up considerable of our
 supplies hunting and they all seemed well pro and left the following day to go down vided for innumerable pole
 scaffolds after another load were passed on which the indians dried their meat so that all indications we began cutting
 the trail from here showed the signs of game in plenty ond in october the party returned to fort st
 johns to winter having cut a on the twelfth day we made seven trail eight feet wide a hundred miles
 bemiles and camped about a mile from yound that point as far as the halfway the tap of the hill

 winter quarters the buildings feed and water were rather primitive being of lags with a mud roof but they served

 muskegs northwest in june the party reached the half during the winter the men were en way river where the
 cache was and gaged in building sleds for use in the there we plunged into the trackless spring before the
 rivers broke up logs country on the further side we found were cut hewn and shaped into runners the two
 men who had been left on and boards and twenty five sleds were charge in good health although lookbuilt each
 capable of carrying six ing a little ragged they had been hundred pounds of provisions or mer visited by a
 party of beaver indians chandise who had supplied them with a considerable amount of fresh moose meat which even the
 horses came through in good was very welcome condition the winter was exceptionally open and out of 67 horses in
 the party our party by this time had learned only fourteen died over fifty head the necessity of getting as
 much fresh came through in very fair condition and meat as possible as there is always when spring opened the
 horses were danger of scurvy when the diet consists ready to work and the men were in principally of bacon
 however we had splendid health never had any cause of sickness up to that time in april 1906 the party
 with inspector richards in charge and myself our pack outfit consisted of 52 horses handling the pack train started to
 get myself with three men and 24 horses ready f or the long trip to fort graham brought up the
 supplies the trail cut two trips were made on the ice up the ting party with the rest of the
 horses peace to the halfway river and moved their own camp all i had to do thence up that river
 to the place where was to keep up with them and keep the trail crossed the point where the them
 supplied with provisions work had ceased the previous fall it we were fortunate in getting over was a very rough
 trip of about 140 when we did as about a week afterward miles each way it being necessary to halfway
 river rose and washed away cut a trail through many places where quite a portion of the trail we had
 cut the ice hummocks were piled many feet along the river bank these rivers north high we had a blacksmith
 with us and of st john generally rise to their highfortunately the horses were sharp shod est in june but
 do not remain up for or it would have been impossible 1 or any length of time they are swift
 and them to keep their feet the floods are soon carried away the thermometer registered 58 degrees the country from
 the halfway river below zero many times during the trip to fort graham is generally thick brush but horses and
 men stood the trip well scrub timber and is in many places by the time that the supplies had all
 swampy we cut a good trail eight been cached at the end of the trail most feet wide to the
 fort on the finlay river of the sleds had seen their best days and and of open or prairie country
 we found are now piled an the bank of the river none to be carried away by the next freshet
 you enter the mountains through the two men were left at the cache and laurier pass which is an easy
 ascension the remainder of the party 20 men some open spats are met with in this returned to fort st
 john where we pass but after reaching the summit and stayed until the expedition started on going down into what
 the indians call the long trail overland on the 15 th of the devil s canyon you have a rough
 may 1906 very poor progress was country for nearly thirty miles with made as horse feed was hard to get
 little or no feed for the horses until one grass does not grow high enough for reaches the ospeka river
 which is feeding purposes until june and the about 35 miles from fort graham 27 we lost several horses on
 this trail an the c p r thence by pack train to and met with a good deal of game
 par stuart lake from thence to ft mcleod ticularly bear of the black variety the at the fort the supplies
 are taken dawn meat was most welcome now and then the parsnip river to the junction with in the mountains
 we ran across a griz the findlay and then up the findlay a zly but they did not bather us
 and we hundred miles to fort graham did not bother them as a grizzly is a you can therefore imagine
 that goods bear that is well to leave alone unless are a high price at this paint any you are
 up a tree little freight you get in casts 20 cents a the ospeka river was high and we pound
 therefore you can understand that it would hardly pay a prospector had some trouble in crossing however we reached fart
 graham on the 15 th or any other to purchase his supplies of august having cut 107 miles of trail
 from the hudson s bay company s store at fort graham that season and the trail is a good one
 on arriving at fort graham we had from the ospeka river to fort gra to put up some kind of
 quarters and ham is dense woods and brush and we with a few scythes we cut a few tons experienced
