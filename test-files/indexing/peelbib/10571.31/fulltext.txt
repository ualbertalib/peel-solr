 5 ethtor s page the regimental depot ceases its training function as of 7 june 1968 and will be disbanded 
 on 31 october 1968 it is possible but not certain that a residual element will remain to look after regimental 
 matters as this is written the first battalion is in cyprus and the second battalion in germany the home station 
 at the hamilton gault barracks is in the process of being taken over by the airborne regiment it is presumed 
 that 1 bn will move to calgary on their return from cyprus whether calgary will become the home station as 
 we know it is not clear we feel certain that whatever happens the regiment will continue to conduct regimental matters 
 including assistance to the association care and custody of the museum publication of the patrician maintenance of the kit shop 
 etc we are glad to note the increase in the number of letters to the editor and hope that some 
 old acquaintances may be renewed as a result our feature article kapyong what is it appears on page 17 it 
 is submitted by lcol owen brown at the request of the editor any thought of changing the regimental system might 
 be dispelled by his knowledgeable views on the value of esprit de corps we have a new trophy in the 
 regiment the cock o the walk trophy shown above which was donated by mr scott copseham copsem lane esher surrey 
 england in memory of his father the late colonel louis scott obe dcm ed the competition is open to the 
 battalions and the depot for the best combined pistol score of the co and rsm it was ready for presentation 
 in january 1968 but to date we are still waiting for the scores to arrive

 regimental executive meeting and to visit the colonel in chief we were asked last year to show the regimental number

 7 letters to the editor 15th august 1967 the editor the patrician ppcli depot the hamilton gault barracks edmonton alberta 
 dear sir i am enclosing some material with reference to frank brown who served with me in the r c 
 r in 1910 and was later killed in action while serving with the ppcli i knew frank well and he 
 was a wonderful guy he was a bugler with g company of the r c r at quebec well educated 
 cheerful at all times a keen sense of humour he would have made his mark in the world had he 
 lived i had a copy of contingent ditties 0:dit 0:ties but i don t seem to be able to locate 
 it i knew there was a copy in the carnegie library here and if you are interested i could copy 
 one or two of them for you yours faithfully w boss lt col 13 ivy crescent ottawa ontario editors note 
 the article on frank brown appears on page 115 followed by a poem from his book continent ditties dear sir 
 thank you for your circular re new edition of ppcli history 1914 1918 0:1914 0:1918 war fortunately i bought the 
 two volumes when they were issued so do not require the new edition about 1928 i think of course i 
 realize the difficulty you face in having a reprint but to me and i suppose all of us survivors of 
 14 18 the nominal roll and record of service is of great interest during the course of years my vol 
 ii nominal roll has been loaned to many and strange to relate the book has always been returned it is 
 interesting to hear from our depot as when the 1914 war broke out i was just completing 6 years service 
 in the rcmp edmonton as our co would not let us have a few weeks leave to enlist i made 
 my way under my own steam to england and overtook the patricia s on salisbury 0:salis 0:bury plain hammie gault 
 was tickled to death to hear that i had come about 5000 miles to join his regiment my kindest regards

 dear editor my uncle avard yuill mathews 411068 served with ppcli during the first great unpleasantness it is only recently 
 that i have come into possession of letters and photographs which throw some light on his record of service as 
 a patricia unfortunately there are many blank areas where the letters were lost or destroyed the rigors of military censorship 
 must also 
 8 have precluded saying much about what happened or where or when because 0:be 0:cause most of the letters say 
 more about the crops in saskatchewan than the war in france i would therefore appreciate hearing from any of his 
 old comrades who remember serving with him and who could enlighten me on the events of those days i have 
 catalogued chronologically as best i could the information available a enlisted at saskatoon 5 april 1915 he was completing the 
 first year of university and joined the first university company to reinforce 0:re 0:inforce ppcli after ypres b on may 
 20th he was in camp niagara on the lake a picture shows three armoured cars of some type c the 
 contingent sailed to england on the ss northland probably in june a picture taken on deck has the names of 
 ptes williams hooper and mathews d in july they were in training at shorncliffe england and a picture shows a 
 group around a lewis gun e on 28 july 1915 he joined ppcli at petit molin farm near ergenheim 0:ergen 
 0:heim there are several pictures of the farm and area f on 15 april 16 he received a head wound 
 probably during a tour in the line at polygon wood he spent some time recuperating at no 2 ccs at 
 paperinghem there are several pictures of this general period but few names and dates one dated january 1916 is titled 
 battalion baths and shows troops removing the grime of the trenches in corrugated iron tubs another dated february 1916 shows 
 a tented divisional rest camp at dranutre by the looks of the ground it was a rather damp and muddy 
 place another tent camp is shown at st martins plain bologne there is a picture of no mans land at 
 wulverghcm belgium 0:bel 0:gium and several of trench 63 pte bourne a a is shown in trench 63 taking pot 
 shots at jerry there are also several pictures of a spot near a place called south camp which must have 
 been a rather larger and more permanent camp there are numerous patricia s in these photos but no names g 
 on 2 june 1916 he was wounded in the foot and evacuated to a british hospital at leicester he comments 
 on the six hours of heavy shelling the unit had taken and how lucky he was to get off so 
 lightly this would be the battle of mount sorrel where brigadier hamilton gault lost a leg h in may 1917 
 he was with the 7th reserve battalion in seaford sussex 0:sus 0:sex taking a musketry course and qualifying as a 
 weapons instructor in october he is still there and getting impatient to rejoin his unit at times he seems more 
 concerned about the progress of threshing at home on the farm than on the course of the war apparently farmhand 
 wages had skyrocketed to four dollars a day a new army order authorized letters to travel postage free if stamped 
 by the orderly room 
 9 i in december of 1917 he was selected for officer training and joined 17 officer cadet battalion at kinmel 
 park wales it was a tough course and the cost of living began to increase rapidly he wrote home to 
 have all his savings transferred to england apparently a corporafs pay didn t stretch too far in the cadets mess 
 j on 30 april 1918 he was discharged 0:dis 0:charged from the ppcli after three years and 26 days of 
 service he was 23 years old on the bth of may 1918 his commissioning appeared 0:ap 0:peared in the london 
 gazette and he joined the ist bn yorkshire regt on the 2nd of may he visited 34 bedford place london 
 to see some of his old friends he writes the lady mrs morris is known as the pats london mother 
 she is very interested in the boys and is only too pleased to forward the mail on he remarks that 
 a decent meal costs a dollar and one must be armed with ration books london is apparently not quite what 
 it once was on 26 october 19 j 8 a notice is received that he is missing in action presumed 
 dead three months later this is confirmed but no trace of a grave is ever found in addition to the 
 letters and pictures 0:pic 0:tures t have a gold collar pin with the marguerite badge on it it is the 
 only one i ve ever seen i have written to the war office requesting that his service medals be forwarded 
 to me if i receive them i shall have them suitably mounted and presented to the regimental museum in the 
 meantime t would be pleased to communicate with anyone who remembers 0:re 0:members anything of my uncle rl mathews captain 
 district cadet officer land headquarters alberta district edmonton alberta march 27 1968 editor the patrician canadian forces base edmonton alberta 
 dear sir some time ago major jjb pariseau at that time with canadian forces headquarters here in ottawa told me 
 that the february 1968 issue of the patrician would be carrying an article on the armed forces search party that 
 went to king william island last year in connection with the ill fated sir john franklin expedition of 1845 major 
 pariseau advised me that he would ask you to send me a copy of the magazine in question i am 
 wondering if the february issue is now available and if you would be kind enough to send me a copy

 copy of contingent 0:con 0:tingent ditties i will gladly send it on to you for the museum in the meantime 
 i am writing to the publishers 0:pub 0:lishers to see if they have a copy lying about i am also 
 writing to foyles of london to see if they can help us find one i was looking up the copy 
 in the ottawa public library this morning and copied the enclosed which you may like to print with the article 
 i have often wondered how frank managed to get into the original princess 0:prin 0:cess pat s for they were 
 95 ex british army types probably he boasted of his r c r service although he was not a year 
 with the company at quebec and then in such competition 0:com 0:petition to reach the rank of sergeant in the 
 spring of 1915 when he could have been only about 211 but frank was an unusual lad had he lived 
 he would probably have commanded the regiment yours sincerely w boss 13 ivy crescent ottawa canada august ist 1967 regimental

 at courcellette on september 15 1916 in nearly every canadian community 0:com 0:munity there is a cenotaph a cross a

 their country and to preserve the freedom in which we live one of these is of particular interest 0:in 0:terest 
 to patricia s it is in the town of almonte some 30 miles west of ottawa and was commissioned by 
 mrs alex g rosamond the widow of lieut ag rosamond who joined the regiment on feb 4th 1916 and was 
 killed at courcelette on the somme on september 15th in the same year it was designed and executed by the 
 noted canadian sculptor dr r tait mackenzie himself a native of the almonte district one of whose better known sculptures 
 is the scottish american memorial in the princess gardens in edinburgh dr mackenzie named his almonte memorial the volunteer the 
 sculpture was modelled on photographs of alex rosamond and it is said that the face was so like alex that 
 mrs rosamond had the sculptor change it as she desired the memorial to perpetuate the memory of all those from 
 the area who had lost their lives recently the names on the base of the memorial were re cut and 
 other ravages of time and weather over the last forty odd years were repaired hal kirkland 411030 ppcli wwi says 
 that the necessary funds were raised without any personal canvass 0:can 0:vass which would indicate that the present generation is 
 not unmindful of their duty to the past there is another story which links alex rosamond with the regiment s

 jc fuller and he gave jim his revolver 0:re 0:volver many years later in the 30 s at fori osborne 
 barracks in winnipeg jim found that a newly joined subaltern 0:subal 0:tern harry cotton was a nephew of alex and 
 turned the revolver over to harry who carried it throughout ww2 while serving in the regiment and later when he 
 commanded the winnipeg 0:winni 0:peg light infantry it is still in his possession r g barclay almonte will renovate its

 various organizations lodges industries 0:in 0:dustries businesses and individuals in the town and district they arc convinced 0:con 0:vinced hat 
 everyone in the community will consider it a privilege to do honor to the memory of the gallant men and 
 boys of the town and countryside to whom they owe so much in all probability 0:pro 0:bability their very existence 
 it is suggested that the people of the town should drop over to the memorial and see the work in 
 progress anyone viewing the work at the cenotaph 0:ceno 0:taph and not feeling once again an overwhelming pride for those 
 whose names are inscribed thereon must surely 0:sure 0:ly be hard of heart by contributing to the project the citizens 
 will not only do homage to the gallant war dead but will also show in a tangible way their gratitude 
 to and admiration for countless others who were ready and willing to pay the same sacrifice that the rest of 
 us should live in freedom and comfort lieut alexander g rosamond a native son of almonte who paid the supreme 
 sacrifice for king and country 0:coun 0:try on september 15th 1916 left provision 0:pro 0:vision in his will for sufficient

 inf bn trg hq in edmonton kapyong a word a name an event a memory what docs it mean much 
 has been written about it already so it is probably redundant for me to phrase a question out of it 
 when 1 was asked to write an article about it i argued that 1 could only be repetitive write it 
 anyway i was told you were there so write about it from your point of view what does one use 
 as a standard of comparison from which to acquire a point of view the little blue patches 1 wear on 
 my sleeves are symbolic of recognition 0:recogni 0:tion of outstanding heroism and exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance 0:per 0:formance 
 of outstanding services which would be the degree of heroism that would warrant award of the distinguished service cross to 
 an individual is that what kapyong should mean today nostalgic heroism seventeen years after the event 1 extract from executive 
 order of the president of the united states on february 26th 1942 
 18 the kapyong action was one of those occasions which probably aroused greater anxiety on the higher levels of command 
 than in the firing line is that it an ulcer for the american commanding general and merely loss of sleep 
 for me cut off and with everything else pulling back the 2nd bn ppcli was the only battalion holding on 
 the army front by their steadfastness and courage above the normal devotion to duty precious time was saved and an 
 orderly withdrawal of 9 corps forces was possible should that be the predominant influence upon my mind a patch on 
 a tyre which prevented the whole thing from going flat their the chinese communist forces main thrust was against i 
 and ix u s corps with the object of a double envelopment against the western sector to isolate seoul the 
 enemy penetrated 6 rok div ix u s corps and drove it south the ensmy attempted to exploit the gap 
 he had created but was prevented by 27 british commonwealth brigade in the area kapyong maybe that s what it 
 should mean a nothing merely an incident which is now largely meaningless in the history of men and their v 
 ars so kapyong what is it what does it mean you find your own standard of comparison and decide for 
 yourself as for me in the first place it was nothing to me not even a name it was merely 
 the identity of a river since i first put on a uniform there have been hundreds of rivers so kapyong 
 meant nothing to me i was a junior officer a company 21c and had spent more time out of the 
 line than in it during the infrequent occasions when i would take over a company from then major george flint 
 there was either no contact with the enemy or when there was insignificant contact as insignificant as these lines from 
 our regiment history when a company passed through fire opened but capt owen browne with two platoons chased off a 
 rearguard and dug in certainly nothing of significance but that was the nature of my war in korea until we 
 were pulled out of the line on the 18 april 1951 and went into some paddy fields to build a 
 tented rest area at chongchon ni about 15 miles behind the fdls and on the banks of the kapyong river 
 we had been there four days of an intended fourteen enjoying the pleasures of a unit created rest area you 
 know lining up the tent pegs whitewashing 0:white 0:washing the stones digging sump pits and occasionally playing volley ball but 
 this idyllic sojourn was interrupted on the morning of 23 april with the incredible news that the front was couapsing 
 under a chinese offensive and that 2 ppclt must immediately go back into the line occupy hill 677 and become 
 a defencein depth 0:defence 0:in 0:depth for the 6th republic of korea 6 rok division which was in the fdls 
 oh well we would still be in corps reserve which with the then known deployments of friendly forces left us 
 about 10 12 miles behind the front although 0:al 0:though we had to be in position by night fall that 
 day the enemy was still two to three days away even if the front was collapsing so kapyong meant nothing 
 more to me than that i would have to stop bawling out then cpl kerry dunphy for having his tent 
 pegs two inches out of line and start bawling him out for having his slit trench two inches too shallow

 concurrently on deployment 0:deploy 0:ment i found myself commanding a company on the right flank overlooking the confluence of two

 unless he cliff scaled into b coy on this note and giving cognizance to the collapsing front rumour a coy 
 dug quickly and well we also trip wired and booby trapped ahellofalot of 36 grenades and 60 mm mortar bombs 
 in a very short time so up to mid afternoon 23 april kapyong meant nothing to me except that if 
 the patricia s were ever required to join battle with hill 677 at issue it would be mainly an a 
 coy battle it was then about mid afternoon that the rumour of a collapsing front acquired a meaning from my 
 arrival until then both the main kapyong valley and the subsidiary valley cutting across the front had been empty of 
 people then suddenly down the road through the subsidiary valley came hordes of men running walking running interspersed with military 
 vehicles totally disorganized mobs they were elements of the 6 rok division which were supposed to be 10 miles forward 
 engaging the chinese but they were not engaging the chinese they were fleeing j was witnessing a rout the valley 
 was filled with men some left the road and fled over the forward edges of a company positions some killed 
 themselves on the various booby traps we had laid and that component of my defensive layout became worthless i saw 
 drivers of military vehicles run over their own men wilfully i saw one man shoot the driver of a vehicle 
 pull him out to the ground take over the vehicle and proceed i would be ghoulish to continue such examples 
 between 1530 hrs and 1800 hrs all of a coy speeded up its defence preparations and digging as it watched 
 helpless to intervene while approximately 4 000 5 000 troops fled in disorganized panic across and through the forward edges 
 of our positions but we knew then that we were no longer 10 12 miles behind the line we were 
 the front line what is now called kapyong assumed its first meaning for me a war or a battle is 
 not won by weight of numbers alone ft is won by the will to win the determination to win of 
 the participants the erstwhile participants i had watched flee had no such will this sudden meaning of kapyong is also 
 a principle of war it s called morale despite the assumed precariousness of my company locality despite the sudden identification 
 of what must certainly become the enemies main axis of advance despite the short time we had had to prepare 
 our defences i watched evening approach with confidence because i knew the morale of a company and it was good 
 despite the shock of what we had just seen you know the conduct of the battle of kapyong it has 
 been well documented on this the first night our battalion was not involved the 3rd royal australian regiment was across 
 the valley on our right the early night was quiet and fairly bright and i was unaware that battle was 
 about to be joined until my company signaller cpl dunbar called me to the radio and asked me to listen 
 in he said the aussies were using the same frequency as ours on a company net and he had been 
 listening to some of their voice traffic he had 
 20 called me because he had just overheard them report that a number of enemy had been sighted in the 
 valley to their front when i started listening in there was the mush sound of a transmitting radio wave which 
 is not carrying a voice someone was holding down the microphone switch but was not speaking and then i heard 
 in a coarse whisper there s about 200 of them now about 600 yards away they ve stopped and seem 
 to be forming up don t fire 1 don t know which direction they re going to go i sent 
 a warning to bhq and to all my sections and continued my eavesdropping the australian radio voice continued with seemingly 
 interminable time spans between transmissions there s more than 200 they are approaching they are passing to the left of 
 the copse shark tail they are about 400 yards away don t fire after another long dause with utter silence 
 throughout the night they re about 200 yards away they ve reached whale bone fire about a mile off to 
 my right i heard the simultaneous commencement of artillery mortar machine gun and rifle fire and saw the night lighted 
 with illumination from many flares battle was joined i had eavesdropped with respectful admiration to a classic application of two 
 points which are ingrained into every officer and man fire control and concentration of force and later using different words 
 but applying the same professional techniques b and d coys implemented similar control and concentration also successfully and kapyonk was 
 meaningul the australian success was complete during these first assaults and later they closed in re grouped slightly fought on 
 throughout the night at daybreak 0:day 0:break the chinese broke off their assault for the day during the day 24 
 april on my immediate front there were chinese recce parties of 3 5 men which twice came into the subsidiary 
 valley examined our ridge lines with binoculars and withdrew back over the skyline never coming closer than 1 000 2 
 000 yards to our nearest positions but nothing else however it was this afternoon that b coy was switched by 
 the co across to my right rear and facing out onto the kapyong valley this left me at the apex 
 of a triangle with what i considered to be three exposed sides and i considered 0:con 0:sidered the position of 
 a coy to be more precarious than ever before however the enemy did not attack the patricias from any frontal 
 direction or angle he attempted the outflanking pincer movement and came at hill 677 from our right rear onto b 
 coy so recently arrived in their new locality and from the left rear onto d coy rather than repeat aspects 
 of the patricia s battle that night i would commend your attention to the detailed article in the patrician of 
 april 1961 vol xiii that night 24 april during the intense fire figh being conducted by b coy my rear 
 platoon began firing long bursts of lmg fire querying this as there had been no evidence of enemy incursion into 
 our company locality and no apparent direct threat to the company i was told enemy heard infiltrating down the reentrant 
 which leads to bhq behind us we re firing fixed line i had hardly received this information when i received 
 a radio blast from the co what s going on in a coy i repeated my recently acquired intelligence of 
 infiltrating enemy who were even now approaching his tac hq down my reen 
 21 trant well stop your firing you bloody fool we can take care of ourselves save your ammunition you re 
 going to need it somewhat later after b coy s success in defeating the enemy thrusts into their locality and 
 the main attack had shifted to d coy s locality i heard sounds of movement and whistles being blown from 
 the vicinity of the ridge line saddle separating me from d coy on my left rear as this was within 
 the battalion perimeter and was one of my df soss i called for 81 mm mortar fire expecting immediate response 
 imagine my surprise when the mortar platoon commander capt lloyd hill asked me on the radio are you under direct 
 attack right now well no well don t call for fire unless you are 1 have exactly eleven rounds left 
 i say again figures one one rounds left and i m about to fire them for d coy with an 
 awareness of the way the battle was going on my right and left rear b and d coys the fact 
 of a coy being critically exposed at the apex of a defended triangle lost its significance a coy had been 
 by passed on two sides i started paying attention to another meaning that suddently loomed clear from kapyong economy of 
 effort never fire a round during battle until it is needed the australian radio transmission of fire control messages i 
 had heard the sounds of battle emanating from b and d coys my knowledge 0:know 0:ledge that then capt wally 
 mills had called artillery fire onto his own position the shock of the radioed words of the co and the 
 mortar officer compared to my own call for a silly little old df sos when nobody was shooting at me 
 all brought into very sharp focus the old hackneyed principle economy of effort and it was meaningful by morning the 
 battle of kapyong was over for all practical purposes a coy had literally not participated we had been the most 
 forward company in the battalion deployment and had been by passed so what does it mean to me kapyong a 
 battle i sat through and merely listened to it means that morale is an identifiable feature in the make up 
 of soldiers and that those without morale are not identifiable as soldiers it means those with a good morale will 
 perform deeds of outstanding heroism and exceptionally meritorious conduct as were performed by b and d coys and would have 
 been by a and c coys had the deployments been reversed kapyong means that principles and details related to the 
 conduct of war are applicable at all levels during the heat of battle such principles and details are not ignored 
 by those aware of their significance with cognizance of this at all levels there would be little justification for historians 
 to record that such occasions probably arouse greater anxiety on the higher levels of commanding than in the firing line 
 kapyong means there would have been no collapse of the front had there been implementation of such principles 0:prin 0:ciples 
 and details of the conduct of war elsewhere as were exhibited during kapyong cut off and with everything else pulling 
 back the 2nd bn ppcli was the only battalion holding but isn t it a shame it had to be 
 that way kapyong a demonstration of what one should expect during the conduct of every and any battle from the 
 patricia s and from every soldierly unit in existence i was present during a battle which in itself and of 
 itself is now perhaps meaningless in the annals of military history as a whole but it is very meaningful to 
 me is it to you 
 22 still serving in the two world wars they were on the battlefield fighting for freedom and in the time 
 since the last global conflict they have served in far away places to preserve the peace they are the gallant 
 men of princess patricia s can adian light infantry and theirs is an envious record of honor dedication and bravery 
 with such a brand of soldier giving service to our nation we can rest assured that our way of life 
 will be diligently guarded government of the province of alberta

 exploits during the 1939 45 war with a trip through belgium and holland in june b coy of second battalion 
 selected a centennial project of great importance to the regiment their task was to retrace the progress of the regiment 
 during the period march to may of 1945 this was to take them from heist op den berg in belgium 
 to achterveld in holland major stutt was approached to research the war diaries concerned and supply as much information as 
 possible the regimental 0:regi 0:mental archives were searched and all available information gleaned from that source a trip to the 
 directorate of history in ottawa supplied the balance of the information and the needed maps covering the project area armed 
 with this material major stutt was off to europe to physically go over the ground and conduct the reconnaissance for 
 the major this was reliving part of the past for he had commanded troops of the regiment throughout this campaign 
 we have been advised that the project was an unqualified success and may be read in the second battalion report 
 within this edition of the patrician the home station was honoured on the 14 15 of october by the attendance 
 0:at 0:tendance of many guests and visitors to the ceremony of trooping the colour performed by the first battalion the 
 weekend was a great success with the ceremony and its accompanying meetings the regimental executive committee the ppcli association committee 
 and annual general meeting and the trustees of the hamilton gault memorial fund lt col am potts cd commanding officer 
 first battalion made this a truly home station ceremony by inviting lts we griesbach and yd cole of the depot 
 to participate in the trooping it was a pleasure for us at the home station to meet and renew acquaintances 
 with ex patricias from nearly every part of canada in september the regimental sergeant major was a member of a 
 foursome 0:four 0:some travelling to calgary to enter the canadian forces zone 2 golf competition they are to be congratulated 
 on bringing the b division championship back with them to base edmonton within the confines of griesbach barracks are two 
 dnd operated public schools these have been known over the years as griesbach no 1 and griesbach no 2 this 
 past june saw two ceremonies held simultaneously renaming these schools number one is now the major general griesbach school and 
 number two has became the brigadier gault school this is indeed another honour for our regiment and its founder the 
 year ended with its usual round of social activities centered around the festive season with it a pause to reflect 
 it is this writer s opinion that the regimental association with all its branches has been brought closer together into 
 the regimental family this writer also wishes to go on record as stating a great deal of credit for this

 the establishment of the canadian permanent force in 1919 the ppcli military band was formed under the direction of capt 
 tw james formerly of the scots guards musicians were recruited almost exclusively from british and colonial regiments which ensured a 
 high degree of musical proficiency from the band s infancy this policy paid off in early international recognition when only 
 five years from its inception the band sailed for england to perform at the british empire exhibition london for most 
 of the bandsmen this was to be a homecoming of some note they performed in many of london s leading 
 theatres and broadcast from europe s largest radio station at that time savoy hill radio station however the greatest honour 
 accorded the band on this tour was personal congratulations of their majesties king george v and queen mary during the 
 20 s and 30 s the band was kept busy at ft osborne barracks winnipeg and with many tours throughout 
 western canada in 1936 capt james retired after long and illustrious service sgt simpson mc and sgt butler carried on 
 until the appointment in 1939 of bandmaster wol al streeter later to become chief inspector of bands with the rank 
 of major however his was to be an appointment of short duration with the outbreak of world war ii that 
 same fall the younger members of the band volunteered for overseas duty as a medical section with the regiment 
 36 as a result it was to be several years before the ppcli again has its own band the organization 
 of the canadian army after ww ii permitted the reactivation 0:re 0:activation of military bands and once again the ppcli 
 military band was to become a major force in canadian band circles enlistments for the bands were slow those first 
 two years and so it was decided to once again recruit musicians in england this proved very successful but with 
 the establishments being raised this policy was expanded to include holland what the band lacked in size it made up 
 for in quality many outstanding 0:out 0:standing musicians were recruited and have made great contributions to the service bands in 
 this country in 1951 lt a brown was appointed director of music ppcli band with a small nucleus he set 
 about to restore the band to its former standard the next year was spent on troop trains travelling between camp 
 wainwright and the port of embarkation seattle home station calgary and families were all but forgotten as troop movements to 
 and from korea kept the band busy playing at dockside or rail siding most of that year came 1953 and 
 it was the bands turn to tour the far east much to the delight of all concerned excepting lt brown 
 of course our instruments went astray and so a glorious week was spent in tokyo while a frantic search was 
 in progress all good things come to an end and it was on to korea while there the band took 
 part in coronation ceremonies of the commonwealth 0:com 0:monwealth brigade as well as entertaining troops of many nations with concerts 
 dances etc on its return to japan the band performed before many high ranking officers at u n headquarters and 
 of note was a massed band concert in hibuya park at which an estimated 25 000 persons were present the 
 visit of our colonel in chief the lady patricia ramsay to currie barracks 0:bar 0:racks calgary was a fitting climax 
 to an eventful year on a clear balmy october afternoon ist and 2nd battalions of ppcli regimental band and regimental 
 corps of drums were on parade for the presentation of colors to 2 battalion capt brown was posted to rce 
 band chilliwack and capt fm macleod took over as director of music in november of 1953 the following july and 
 august will not soon be forgotten by those of us in the regimental band who had the privilege of performing 
 at and witnessing the spectacular events of the british empire games held in and around vancouver b c most notable 
 of course was the thrill of being down at track level and watching for the first time ever two men 
 breaking the 4 minute barrier in the mile run and jimmy peters gallant effort to remain on his feet coming 
 down the ramp into empire stadium only 300 yards from the finish of a gruelling 26 mile marathon new year 
 s day 1957 brought a change over in the command of the band once again capt ha jeffrey took the 
 baton from capt macleod who was posted to ldsh rc band fn september of 1967 the band sailed for europe 
 and a two year tour of duty with the canadian brigade in germany an extremely busy schedule lay ahead and 
 the first big engagement was not long in coming a guard of honor and state ball for the state visit 
 of their majesties queen elizabeth and prince philip to holland her royal highness personally complimented the band on its performance 
 the tenth anniversary celebrations of nato were next and ppcli band joined with other bands and troops in a massed 
 parade at mainz germany to honour the occasion 
 37 many firsts over the years have been recorded by the regimental band and 1959 was no exception a tour 
 of unef middle east the the first visit by a canadian band once again history was made when the band 
 was invited to participate in britain s foremost military show the royal tournament and became the first canadain band to 
 ever do so a trooping the colour ceremony with all commands in french and a belgian army parade with all 
 the commands in flemish added colour to our year both needless to say went off without a hitch its tour 
 in europe over the band sailed for canada in october 1959 and a new home station at hamilton gault barracks 
 edmonton alberta the present director of music capt gc naylor took command of the band in 1964 centennial year was 
 the big one for all canadians and the band did more than its share that year ten members were posted 
 to the national tattoo for its duration while the remainder joined it for a two month performance tour in victoria 
 vancouver and finally on to expo 67 for a record breaking one month run somehow we managed two weeks leave 
 before starting rehearsals with the alberta armed forces caravan a smaller version of the national tattoo that was to reach 
 into every corner of the province of alberta covering a distance of roughtly 7 000 miles in two months there 
 was to be no rest for us yet though as the band and battalion swung into rehearsals for a centennial 
 year trooping we have now reached centennial plus one and our future is very much up in the air the 
 possibility of amalgamation with another band and a move to a new station is beginning to look more likely with 
 each passing day but whatever happens one thing remains certain this band has over the years performed 0:per 0:formed in 
 such a way as to be a credit to the uniform the regiment and themselves 0:them 0:selves and will continue 
 to do so as long as the initials ppcli are worn proudly on our flashes directors of music capt a

 39 first battalion the first battalion princess patricia s canadian light infantry began canada s centennial year newly established in 
 the hamilton gault barracks after its rotation from germany the first priorities were to convert and train parachutists then to 
 brush up in winter warfare as a result of our new operational role the number of persons wearing wings increased 
 considerably in the first few months of 1967 as serials of freshly qualified parachutists returned from the airborne school at 
 rivers manitoba the old jumpers received conversion training in ci3oe hercules aircraft and were also added to the battalion roll 
 of active jumpers the battalion s commitment for parachute conversion training continued for the duration of the year regardless of 
 rumors concerning the conversion training in ci3oe hercules aircraft formation of the canadian airborne regiment the final airborne exercise exercise 
 oilstove was conducted on 28 november 67 in the bon accord area a composite airborne coy dropped onto an unusually 
 hard dz then moved to defend a railway bridge on the sturgeon river the expected attack by the athabasca rangers 
 materialized but was promptly crushed by the awaiting airborne killers winter warfare came as somewhat of a shock to those 
 used to the balmy climates of victoria and deilinghofen however a winter warfare training programme 0:pro 0:gramme was immediately initiated 
 in january and the warm weather soldier was moulded into an arctic fox during a two week course exercise white 
 bear 7 17 february 67 proved that we had learned our lessons well we

 lt merv mcmurray and 64 other ranks they served as a security force with the unef in camp rafah and 
 camp marina el arish their tour ended abruptly on 31 may 67 when the force was withdrawn from the gaza 
 strip and the sinai desert prior to the arab israeli war at the beginning of centennial year the commander 1 
 cibg cancelled the summer concentration in favour of complete brigade participation in the alberta celebrations the battalion s contribution was 
 made in the form of b company which became the foundation for the alberta armed forces centennial caravan the caravan 
 commanded by maj john de chastelain conducted a month of rehearsals and began their 60 day tour with a performance 
 in the hamilton gault barracks on 30 july 67 the measure of their success is perhaps best explained in this 
 extract from the red deer advocate of 15 august 67 which covered the visit the red team ys blue team 
 part of 1 ppcli s centennial caravan contribution participating in the mortar race who could not help but feel just 
 a bit more proud of being canadian this day a party of eight persons commanded by lt paul ronksley travelled 
 to the northwest territories in early july to participate in a high altitude test on mt logan from 7 to 
 28 july 67 the mission was cancelled after six days due to weather conditions on the mountain which prevented the 
 setting up of the testing centre august also saw the start of the other main centennial project by the 
 41 battalion project franklin project franklin was proposed as a centennial project 0:pro 0:ject to the minister of national defence 
 by mr w g mckenzie a civilian from london ont he proposed that a search of the king william island 
 area be undertaken with the aim of locating the grave of sir john franklin and the missing records for his 
 expedition of 1845 in search of the north west passage cfhq tasked mobile command to conduct the search with hq 
 1 canadian infantry brigade as planning and executive headquarters 1 transport helicopter platoon for support and 1 ppcli providing the 
 platoon sized group commanded by capt bob gillan to conduct the search the search was planned for 3 25 august 
 67 using gladman point king william island district of franklin nwt as the base camp after a support recce of 
 the area 13 14 may 67 the search group departed with scuba divers photographers and photo interpreters in addition to 
 the ground troops and helicopters from 5 11 august and 11 17 the individual section search parties were heli lifted 
 to their search locations to carry out their tasks the first period was a routine search however the second became 
 more adventurous when the weather closed in and the teams could not be picked up on 14 august as previously 
 planned with three days rations the sections held out until the ceiling and visibility lifted and the choppers could lift 
 them out change of command 1 ppcli lcol am potts cd takes over from lcol h moncrief cd august 68

 was a success in other areas though experiences 0:ex 0:periences gained on living conditions ground and air travel and scuba 
 diving operations in the arctic will certainly be very useful to mobile command troops editor s note see page 57 
 august also brought us a new commanding officer lieutenant colonel am potts cd lt col potts who joined the regiment 
 in 1945 was posted to 1 ppcli with promotion from the canadian army advisory training team tanzania lt col h

 the year was undoubtedly ex foynes night bird 10 17 august this exercise although covered elsewhere in the patrician in 
 a report written by capt peter littlehales 3 bn royal green jackets still deserves mention in the battalion report the 
 exercise was conducted in the cache lake area of entrance provincial 0:pro 0:vincial park just north of hinton alberta the 
 battalion was slightly familiar with this area having spent a week in june in the same locale on adventure training 
 on 10 august the battalion moved out to this area 200 strong supplemented 0:supple 0:mented with militia on summer call 
 out for exercise as we called it night bird after a few days setting up camp we deployed on our 
 counter infiltration tasks for three days we maintained road patrols bank posts and listening posts in an attempt to spot 
 and capture the enemy 22 regt special air services from england with a few notable successes we attained this aim 
 on the last night the sas crossed the athabasca river and deployed in platoon sized groups to attack their objectives 
 they launched successful attacks against such targets as the hinton pulp and paper mill perhaps their success would not have 
 been so great had the civilian security guards not placed a composite platoon from sp coy under civilian arrest tor 
 unauthorized entry into the mill after their release from custody a cease fire was called at 0800 hours and everyone 
 returned to base camp for a day of cleaning stores followed by a battalion bar b que attended by the 
 sas everyone agreed that qms king had put on an excellent display of good western cooking the following day it 
 was return to edmonton for the battalion and a farewell to 22 regt sas as they went on a short 
 tour of jasper banff and calgary prior to departing for england trooping 1967 on saturday october 14th the battalion trooped

 battalion returned from block leave and after the change of command between lt col moncrief and lt col potts twelve 
 officers and sixty five other ranks of the british special air service arrived in edmonton for two weeks of training 
 they arrived on 6th august and although they came out under the auspices of 22 regt sas the regular unit 
 they were in fact a composite force including members of 22 regt and territorials militia from both 21 and 23 
 regts on 7th august they moved out to an area about 30 miles north of hinton and set up a 
 bivouac area there they conducted their own training for four days before deploying for our joint exercise they had kindly 
 invited some of us to partcipate as patrol members for the main exercise and sgts harris mcdow and cpl pidgeon 
 were duly volunteered they went with a little apprehension but concluded at the end of the exercise that not only 
 had they managed to teach the sas a thing or two but had even picked up a few tips themselves 
 the battalion or what was left of it after meeting our alberta centennial caravan commitments consisting of about two hundred 
 all ranks moved out to a bivouac area near cache lake entrance provincial park on 10th august we were to 
 act as un troops called into prevent infiltration and acts of sabotage being conducted by the inevitable northlanders represented by 
 the sas on the night of the llth august the sas deployed and as a result of intelligence reports fed 
 to it the battalion deployed to join battle on 12th august a joint exercise headquarters consisting of battalion headquarters and 
 thq sas control staff was set up on athabasca lookout near the fire tower this hill is a magnificent vantage 
 point standing over 5 000 feet high and it affords some of the loveliest views of the rockies in all 
 alberta it was a joy to work up there particularly as the weather was so kind to us and it 
 also greatly assisted maintaining communications over our extended battalion area by noon on 13th august both companies had made contact 
 with the enemy and support company commanded by major bill hewson captured three prisoners these unfortunates were returned to battalion 
 headquarters where they were put into a pow cage here they were introduced to s sgt buxton his team of 
 guards and three members of the canadian intelligence corps all were suitably disguised as fantasians and did a good job 
 of persuading their charges to behave themselves 
 49 the following day 14th august a company commanded by capt fred berry had a great deal of success and 
 captured a further eight prisoners one such prisoner sgt mcdow was subjected to a dose of his own medicine the 
 controlled game of hide and seek continued until the night of the 15th august by then it became obvious that 
 the northlandcrs were going to cross the athabasca 0:atha 0:basca river to attack various targets to the south the two 
 companies were pulled back across the river to try and prevent this and achieved varying degrees of success shortly after 
 dawn on the 16th august capt fred berry was mortified when he drove into an sas ambush and was captured 
 his morale however rose appreciably when the filthy british removed his boots and he remembered he had put on a 
 clean pair of socks that morning exercise cease fire was called at 0800 hours on 16th and everyone made their 
 way back to the battalion bivouac area at cache lake the rest of the day was spent cleaning up and 
 in the evening qms king laid on an excellent barbecue for all ranks this was a new experience for the 
 sas and there is iittle doubt they thoroughly enjoyed their canadian outing after a quick tour around jasper banff and 
 calgary the sas returned to edmonton and flew back to england on 19th august officers mess report after a slow 
 recovery in january from the holiday season and the added chore of settling into a new location the mess got 
 into the social swing in february when our friends from 1 qor of c staged through to wainwright for an 
 exercise on 16 february the mess entertained lt col herb pitts and his officers to an abundance of beer and 
 oysters the first mixed function of the 1967 season was a highly successful cabaret night held on 18 february the 
 ladies hosted a spring tea on 6 april and invited the wives of the local government consular and military personages 
 to tea where more sherry than tea was consumed march 17th was celebrated by the officers receiving their usual trouncing 
 by the sergeant s mess at broomball we recovered and celebrated with a mixed formal dinner in the mess the 
 battalion was inspected by brigadier sc waters in early may this resulted in a round of functions members of the 
 mess attended the canadian armed forces tattoo at the edmonton gardens on 12 may and the officers guests and families 
 enjoyed a buffet dinner in the mess prior to this event on 27 may hrh princess alexandra presented colours to 
 the loyal edmonton regiment 3 ppcli and 418 auxiliary squadron rcaf after which a reception was held in the mess 
 that night there was an informal mixed function hosted by our militia battalion after a quiet month of june we 
 were honoured by the visit of earl mountbatten and his daughter lady patricia brabourne who were guests at a luncheon 
 on 7 july on the previous evening mess members and their ladies had gathered to greet major general cb ware 
 who presented to the mess on 
 50 major general cb ware dso cd presented the gault sterling silver plates to the officers mess on behalf of 
 mrs a hamilton gault lcol h moncrief cd accepted for the mess behalf of mrs a hamilton gault a set 
 of six sterling silver plates engraved with the gault crest these had been our founder s favourite pieces of silver 
 and they were gratefully received by lt col h moncrief on behalf of the officers on 16 august members of 
 22 special air service regiment with whom the battalion had been jousting in the hinton area hosted a barbecue for 
 the home station officers and ladies in our mess 
 51 the officers 1 ppcli with the reviewing officer major general ae potts cbe ed 12 october 67 mrs a 
 hamilton gault was a welcome guest of the mess at a dinner on 2 october and as always we enjoyed 
 her graciousness and interest in our activities the living in officers sponsored a halloween party in late october with a 
 great pumpkin motif during the week prior we were brainwashed with charlie brown and snoopy cartoons leading up to the 
 great event trooping the first such event for i ppcli since 1964 kept the mess staff busy coping with a 
 mess dinner on 12 october an informal reception on 13 october followed by the yip reception and the ball on 
 14 october this was topped off by the association luncheon on sunday 15 october the ball was an unqualified success 
 and we crammed 260 persons in the mess and attached marquees to add to our pleasure a great number of 
 serving patricias arrived from the east with general wab anderson despite the disappearance of a hat the ball resulted in 
 many favourable comments from our miests major general potts prior to the association luncheon planted a blue spruce to commemorate 
 his visit and his participation as reviewing officer at trooping general anderson accompanied by colonel dh rochester commander desgnate of 
 the airborne regiment returned to the home station in late october this led to further speculation and rumour which to 
 date remains unconfirmed our big venture in november was the game dinner utilizing the big game birds and varied fish 
 shot or caught by our hunting addicts a successful evening was enjoyed at minimum charge by 160 members and guests 
 after recovering from trooping the mess faced another series of deficits in the forthcoming holiday season which appeared in the 
 same quarterly financial statement the mess committee however managed to pull through without too great a loss the officers entertained 
 the sergeants following the men s christmas dinner on 22 december this was followed by our annual tea dance on 
 boxing day a successful new year s eve party was held in conjunction with the loyal edmonton regiment and resulted 
 in sixty five couples welcoming in the new year which will see 1 ppcli in cyprus and those remaining trying 
 to maintain the officers mess on a good operating basis until their return

 club the new year started with a ball held in the men s mess hall the attendance was very good 
 especially with most of our members being on leave at home for the first time in three years in february 
 approximately 50 members volunteered to serve in egypt for one year with the un forces a going away party was 
 held in the junior ranks club for all members the highlight of the party occurred when the pmc presented all 
 the members with standing orders to drive camels the summer was mostly divided among training courses away from camp preparation 
 for the centennial caravan and a two week period of training for the trooping ceremony a few of our members

 a needy family the club donated a sum of money to the cadets this donation was used to buy binoculars 
 for proficiency prizes volunteers from the club also served hot dogs and soft drinks at the cadet parade our main 
 project of the year was a combined bazaar and bake sale held in the northgate mall in early december the 
 event which also included a raffle for three lovely prizes was an unqualified success we were pleased and proud to 
 present the proceeds a cheque for 501 64 to the winnifred stewart school for retarded children 
 55 entertainment during the year included a talk on fabrics and styles a stanley party a cookie exchange bingo and 
 a most enjoyable dinner and party held at our may meeting to wind up activities until september during the year 
 a number of members left on postings and as is the custom were presented with engraved silver spoons a recent 
 highlight was an interesting and informative talk on cyprus presented by lieutenant colonel am potts with the battalion s posting 
 to cyprus coming up in the near future the subject was one which appealed to all of us during the 
 six months that the battalion will be in cyprus we hope to be of assistance to 1 ppcli wives here 
 at home we have formed an emergency baby sitting service made up of volunteer members we hope too to have 
 various activities at our meetings planned to help pass the time more quickly and pleasantly in conclusion may we thank 
 all the executive and committee members and all the other ladies who worked so hard to make this year a 
 success may we also extend an invitation and a welcoming hand to any other ppcli wives to come to our 
 meetings and take part in what we are confident will be a pleasant busy and productive year with the 1

 57 project franklin capt rd gillan perhaps the greatest mystery of the canadian north concerns sir john franklin s expedition 
 and their search for the northwest passage in 1848 sir john died on that expedition but his grave has never 
 been found nor have the expedition s scientific records and as the entire crew perished not one clue is available 
 to point the way the latest of many searches for the grave of sir john franklin and his expedition s 
 records was undertaken by 1 ppcli this project was proposed to the minister of national defence by mr w mckenzie 
 of london ontario as a dnd centennial project mr mckenzie has a great interest in canada s arctic and particularly 
 franklin s ill fated expedition it rwas he who provided much of the background and information on which the search 
 patterns were based in 1845 sir john franklin seasoned arctic explorer was given command of an expedition whose purpose was 
 to discover the long sought northwest passage from north atlantic to north pacific this expedition consisted of two vessels h 
 m s erebus and h m s terror and 129 all ranks all highly qualified arctic veterans the ships sailed 
 from england on 18 may 1845 making their way via baffin bay and lancaster sound up the wellington channel to 
 a latitude of 77 n the highest latitude ever navigated at that time and down the west coast of cornwallis 
 island to winter quarters at beechy island the following summer area in which 1 ppcli s franklin expedition conducted its 
 centennial year search for some trace of sir john franklin s ill fated party 
 58 1846 the expedition attempted to sail westward seeking passage in the direction of the then unknown land mass of 
 victoria and banks islands they again attempted passage through the wellington channel but this attempt ran afoul of the perpetual 
 mountainous ice which exists there eventually however franklin discovered and navigated the principal channel comprising the only practicable northwest passage 
 and is now recognized as its discoverer as the summer of 1846 wore on franklin turned southward following open water 
 until heavy ice stopped his ships about 15 leagues northwest of cape felix king william island there his ships were 
 seized by the formidable stream of heavy perpetual ice which pours into melville sound from the beaufor sea and extends 
 down mcclintock channel to the shores of king william island the ships were on 12 september 1846 beset in the 
 ice never again to be released under the guidance of their crews th expedition s fortunes began to turn against 
 them with the death of sii john franklin on 11 june 1847 at the age of 61 mortality during that 
 previouswinter 0:previous 0:winter had been high twenty all ranks having died evidently scurvey had begur to exact its toll the 
 ships and their crews remained in the ice throughout the summer ol 1847 and their situation deteriorated further then as 
 their three year provisions were at an end chances of release from the ice seeming remote and disease tunning rampant 
 the new leader captain crozier rn elected to abandon the ships and make for fort reliance on great slave lake 
 via the back river a distance of approximately 900 miles not one of the 105 men who left the ships 
 on 25 april 1848 survived a trail of skeletal remains and naval impedimenta 0:impedi 0:menta told a tale of disease 
 and starvation it is reasonably certain that some did make it as far as montreal island at the mouth of 
 the back river southeast from king william island but none any further than that these intrepid seamen left a message 
 at victory point stating their intent to make for the back river and giving franklin s date of death no 
 other record of their retreat was found no ships logs no scientific records and no clues as to where sir 
 john was buried there have been no less than 25 search expeditions but while a large number of them helped 
 to determine the fate that befell the crews none of them found any expedition records any trace of the erebus 
 and terror or sir john franklin s last resting place suppositions and theories abound and a wealth of information exists 
 on the subject from much research and study it was determined 0:deter 0:mined to concentrate our search in the following 
 areas a cape felix cape jane franklin coast this was the nearest land to the ships and some evidence that 
 the expedition used it had been found previously b area of the magnetic pole of 1846 at that time it 
 was directly opposite 0:op 0:posite cape felix on the boothia coast the expedition was tasked to examine polar magnetism and 
 this area would have been important to the expedition c vicinity of o reilly island in queen maud gulf eskimo 
 legend has this area as the resting place of one of the ships a few other locations were considered and 
 searched places with names such as starvation cove and terror bay these were locations where some remains 0:re 0:mains had 
 been found by earlier search parties and we were hopeful of finding relics in these spots 
 59 the main area of the tragedy king william island is a rather dismal location the island is low no 
 point above 300 ft above sea level typical of the arctic tundra the ground is very marshy and some quicksand 
 exists the land is crisscrossed by streams and stagnant pools and is poorly drained raised beaches and eskers run generally 
 north and south on the island and these make for easy going on foot fortunately as moving over the marsh 
 is impossible wildlife abounds in the summer arctic with geese and swans inhabiting the lakes and pools and caribou in 
 the interior the caribou cross to the island from the mainland just before the ice breaks up and return just 
 after freeze up arctic char abound in the sheltered bays of the surrounding sea and some trout exist in the 
 larger lakes almost everyone had the opportunity to catch char and the champion fish was 13 5 lbs cleaned caught 
 by cpl gurski the expedition s cook under the operational command of capt rd gillan 25 patricias 6 divers from 
 1 field squadron rce two photographers and two photo interpreters from 408 squadron and dpic respectively and four civilians arrived 
 by ci3oe hercules at gladman point king william island on 4 august two ch 113 a voyageur helicopters supporting the 
 operation arrived the following day august 4th was a clear sunny day with light linds which would have been quite 
 pleasant had there not been choking hordes of mosquitoes the ground search party was divided into five groups of four 
 and each allotted a section to cover movement of these sections was to take place every two days by ch 
 113 a and the sections were equipped and rationed for a four day period two sections eight men were initially 
 given the task of searching the gape felix cape jane franklin coast three sections were dispatched to the boothia coast 
 and the divers went to o reilly island divers off o reilly island 
 60 cpl dickson s section with ppcli cairn cape felix standing left to right sgt atkinson pte carr cpl dickson 
 kneeling cpl conley and pte goguen cpl dickson s section at cape felix was tasked with erecting a commemorative 0:com 
 0:memorative cairn in honour of 1 ppclfs franklin expedition the prefabricated 0:prefabri 0:cated all steel tripod cairn complete with hat 
 badge replica was cemented into the rocky coast of king william island at cape felix more precisely its location is 
 latitude 6954 north longitude 9759 west its construction will enable it to withstand the elements and it will remain to 
 commemorate the patricia s franklin expedition to the barren lands a recce flight was made the day the helicopters arrived 
 to gjao haven on the southeast end of the island to interview a native who had guided major tl burwash 
 on his explorations in the arctic in the late twenties unfortunately george had little information which could benefit our search 
 it was interesting to note some of the history of gjao haven anumdsen wintered there during his navigation of the 
 northwest passage and today his expedition s records are buried there with the search parties deployed life at base camp 
 was relaxing with fishing taking priority some magnificent arctic char were caught and devoured with relish our first difficulties developed 
 when both helicopters incurred engine damage from the gravel landing zone they had been using one engine in each chopper 
 required replacing an urgent call to mobile command and the transport 
 61 helicopter detachment namao over distant early warning line circuits resulted in a 435 squadron ci3of hying the required engines 
 to gladman point time host well from the time the helicopters were grounded until the damaged engines were replaced and 
 the aircraft airborne 36 hours had passed a reasonable time lag considering the distances involved it certainly made us feel 
 less remote those 36 hours lost were only the beginning of a string of misfortunes all brought about by difficult 
 weather conditions after the engine changes all sections were moved to their next search locations and were to be resupplied 
 as necessary pick up and return to base camp would take place on 13 and 14 august and the first 
 stage of our expedition s search would be complete however on 12 august the weather settled in on us heavy 
 fog winds of 40 m p h and up and temperatures of 34 this was to persist for six days 
 preventing the helicopters 0:heli 0:copters from flying and thus preventing any contact with the search sections the only communications equipment 
 our expedition had was in the form of prc 125 sets with a range of 30 35 miles when working 
 to airborne helicopters the sections were at the closest 70 miles and at the most distant 110 miles from base 
 camp it was difficult to estimate who was the more anxious those at base camp or those in the middle 
 of the desolate arctic wastes the sections had enough supplies to last until 14 august fortunately we had managed to 
 produce a fresh supplement to the rather monotonous rp4 which helped to stretch the food a little pte beaujoli with 
 cpl main on the northwest coast of the island was quite worried as his food intake was not up to 
 its normal large scale proportion because of the food rationing cpl main had necessarily imposed beaujoli was much relieved when 
 the choppers finally arrived to return them to gladman pt although vocal about the usefulness of the aircraft during those 
 days of bad weather winds gusting to 50 m p h were experienced with driving rain and some snow unfortunately 
 our arctic tents cpl main s section at cape john franklin left to right ptes boisjoi pickerl cpls gould and 
 main with capt binney 1 tpt hel pi 
 62 provided too little protection from these elements more than one section awoke to find that their tent pole had 
 given way and the tent was down around their ears at this stage of the search hopes of finding one 
 of the ships or its wreckage were raised by the finding of amounts of debris by the divers although in 
 most cases the sea bottom in the area of o reilly island was bare a pattern to the shore debris 
 seemed evident suggesting a ship might possibly be nearby unfortunately the divers were limited to a 50 ft depth which 
 prohibited searching at a level where the sea ice would not grind to pieces any wreck resting on the bottom 
 after spending 48 hrs at gladman pt to rest and clean equipment and after catching a year s supply f 
 arctic char the sections were redeployed since the results both on the northwest coast of king william island and on 
 boothia had been disappointing these bases were left in favour of new ground two sections were deployed to taylor island 
 near victoria island to cover the entire area this island figures in the old eskimo stories of a massacre 0:mas 
 0:sacre at ommanak eskimo against white men supposedly members of franklin s expedition if this were the case perhaps some 
 artifacts would remain however no evidence supporting this legend was found apparently the island is well frequented by the eskimos 
 as the southern half of the island has numerous hunting blinds and tent circles cpl smith tw and his section 
 went to terror bay in an effort to locate the grave of a member of the franklin expedition rebuilt in 
 1931 by mrs patsy klengenberg and any remains of the numerous skeletons reported there by cf hall in 1866 a 
 detailed two day search of the mud flats surrounding the bay produced no results other than muddy boots and wet 
 feet cpl main s section greeted their next search area with some concern starvation cove what with the effect of 
 weather on the helicopter s flying they felt that the name indicated reason for some foreboding starvation gove was the 
 resting place of some thirty seamen and possibly the ship s records as eskimos described to earlier searchers how they 
 had found a metal box containing papers and books in the area cpl rd dickson s section assisted in the 
 search of this area with however 0:how 0:ever no results weather conditions were somewhat worse than we had been led 
 to expect we did have a meteorological survey report on the area but its description 0:descrip 0:tion of conditions was 
 rather vague generally days were cold 36 f 38 f with upwards of 15 m p h wind with heavy 
 cloud layers and fog it was this bad weather that severely cut into the helicopter s flying time and consequently 
 into our search programme the expedition produced a number of worthwhile results relating to military operations in the summer arctic 
 in addition to its historical contribution many observations were noted on equipments and rations notably the expedition s average weight 
 loss over the three week period after a diet of rp4 s for that period that loss was 12 lbs 
 per individual physical efficiency understandably suffered from this deficiency in addition to searching for franklin s relics our searchers kept 
 a wary eye for eskimo artifacts on behalf of our national museum representative dr david hughes each section made a 
 note of any eskimo tent circles or ancient encampments and passed them to dr hughes he estimated our expedition turned 
 up several seasons field work for the museum and we did discover some arrowheads and human skulls

 64 while no specific finds relating to franklin s ill fated expedition were turned up the expedition did uncover a 
 few interesting historical objects cpl dickson s section discovered the remains of a seaman s boot at cape felix which 
 likely was a remnant from the summer camp that the franklin expedition had at that spot the section also discovered 
 two cairns built by inspector larsen rcmp in 1949 one of which contained a copy of his note stating in 
 part we note two small islets off this cape it is believed that sir john franklin s grave might be 
 on one of these islets unfortunately even a helicopter recce could not confirm the existence of the islets as the 
 heavy ice extended well onto the beach on boothia cpl smith s section discovered a tall cairn which we believed 
 to be the one erected by sir james ross in 1831 to mark the magnetic pole of that year the 
 description he rendered of the area is the same however no recorc was found within this cairn and so our 
 proof was not positive many authors and authorities on canada s arctic notably rear admira noel wright r n ret 
 d believe sir john franklin s grave to be in the boothi northern king william island areas and none of 
 the earlier search partie had proven to the contrary project franklin 1967 however conclusiveh proved that sir john s grave 
 is not in those areas and thereby dispels mam theories on the fate of franklin time has erased almost all 
 vestiges of the fateful retreat of the starving and diseased crews certainly our expedition was the best equipped largest and 
 most thorough ever to go to the area in search ol franklin s grave if it had been there we 
 would have found it evidently the fate of franklin will remain canada s greatest arctic mystery perhaps forever bibliography a

 easily the most popular events of the day included the apc rides the beer and buffalo burgers provided by the 
 ppcli rod and gun club and the ldsh rc motorcycle team the ppcli corps of drums led by cpl smith 
 and cpl rose as well as the regimental band of the sherwood foresters beat retreat and played the national anthems 
 of canada and germany it was a very moving ceremony for the canadians thousands of miles away from home and 
 that pride that comes from being a canadian with all the good will that this means in europe was deeply 
 felt as the crowd joined with the band in singing o canada on the training front mortar platoon with capt

 under the name of rapier blade sharpened the tactics of the patricia s in preparation lor the divisional exercise rob 
 roy approximately forty militia soldiers from canada flew to germany to participate with their regular equivalents from all accounts they 
 came away deeply impressed with the infantry s mobility endurance and firepower these exercises also allowed the soldiers plenty of 
 scope in exerting their own initiative pte boisjoli in b company took over as the company cqms for a large 
 period of time all the companies used private soldiers as section and patrol commanders many with little or no experience 
 in tactics or communications lt steingart did a good job in reserve 
 74 the culmination of these exercises was rob roy in which 4 cibg acted as the enemy for 4 br 
 div one of the most successful aspects of this exercise was the use of small tank hunting teams to ferret 
 out the advancing british armour but at ore point the situation looked bleak for the patricia s as their flank 
 was about to be turned but lcol peacock s prompt use of ross force saved the day support company led 
 by major ross suddenly found themselves thrown into the breach drivers clerks cooks and fatiguemen manned the defences in a 
 brilliant display of impromptu tactics lt steingail stayed in reserve the anti tank platoon with lt lewis sgt wilson cpls

 be tested on this inspection but perhap i not the way that sgt rw shepherd thought while being inspected by 
 lcci peacock he heard the co say gas instead of having his platoon don ther protective masks sgt shepherd very 
 calmly replied yes sir we have plenty the social life of the battalion swung into high gear in the fall 
 with the officers mess having a hsaven and hell party the sgts mess holding a bingo night and visiting the 
 dusseldorf police museum and range while the corporal 
 75 beld a come as you are party cpl stothard was the hit of the party dressed quite casually in 
 his bathrobe the men s canteen surged ahead in 1967 with the acquisition of new gasthof furniture for the wet 
 bar the pioneers usually led by pte holzneckt did themselves proud replacing all the glass in the wet bar with 
 tinted panes and installing room dividers in the wrvs lounge our lady in green miss joan barter hosted many games 
 nights both at home and away she claims the first battalion had a better dart team sgt richardson became the 
 junior ranks club supervising nco and through his continuing efforts and in spite of the putzfraus the whole club was

 10 pi of d company led by lt arril took off for the field again this time to take part

 for a month or so broke out of his shell and single handedly renovated the officers mess bar he received 
 an ample reward for his actions considerably easing the burden of duties of the other subalterns the results of the

 to have monica and kathy as part of the patricia family again this year the battalion hosted a very successful 
 party for the orphans in the hemer area kris kringle paid a visit and presents were there for everyone with 
 christmas a universal language seems to exist as our soldiers had no difficulty in acting as fathers for a day 
 
 76 the year ended on a happy note with a dependent s party and new year s balls in all 
 the messes the battalion was very fortunate in having the colonel of the regiment major general cb ware and his 
 wife arrive to see in the new year with us thus the year of 1967 was as varied a year 
 as the battalion has had hard work mentally taxing exercises tragedy humour and companionship all etched their markings into the

 79 centennial project b company second battalion editor s note the following is a condensed account from a journal written 
 by major mc stewart cd company commander for the project introduction in march 1967 it was proposed that b company 
 2 ppcli be permitted to undertake a project in europe to commemorate canada s centennial year various plans were discussed 
 the final selection was a plan to follow the route and duplicate the activities of the ppcli during march april 
 and may 1945 on the advance through belgium germany and holland on 21 march 1945 the regiment had arrived in 
 belgium from italy went into billets south east of antwerp and were in achterveld holland near amersfoort when hostilities ceased

 support weapon sections reconnaissance detachments a pioneer section an rceme detachment cooks and drivers sketch map b company project saturday 
 29 july 1967 we left fort macleod at 0900 hours on a route to go through koln aachen and liege 
 south east of antwerp we were met by a belgian mp escort who apparently had no clear idea of where 
 to escort us but with the arrival of our belgian liaison officer commandant van goethen our difficulties ceased and 
 80 we were guided to the town of booischot by 1615 hours support and headquarters companies with battalion headquarters were 
 quartered here from 21 march 2 april 1945 the bivouac area was a wooded area in the estate of baron 
 de gruben a former belgian ambassador to the us and germany and the area was immediately 0:im 0:mediately inundated with 
 hordes of children and some older people who remembered 0:re 0:membered the regiment war diary entry 21 march 1945 reads 
 the people are very friendly indeed and can t do enough for the troops they haver i changed sunday 30 
 july 1967 the baron dropped in for a chat this morning to welcome us son e of us went to 
 church and later put on a short display of weapons and equipment the town band was in attendance to entertain 
 us following the display tl e officers and the csm were invited to a reception in the town hall the 
 burge meester made a fine speech in english and presented the company with a silver tray enscribed herinnering 1945 booischcot 
 30 07 67 remembering at lunch we met a lady who occupied the castle during the war and she showed 
 us a book of signatures and photographs of soldiers who stayed at the castle durii g that time the names 
 of patricia s cover two pages including signatures of lieutet ants cm pyne capt ed macphail and capt am mills 
 in the afternoon the company moved 4 miles to the town of heist op dei berg where a b and 
 c companies were quartered the burgomeester remen bered the regiment well and presented us with a handsome pewter plate and 
 a book of sketches of the locale monday 31 july 1967 we left at 0900 hours and duplicated the move 
 to the reichwald fore t in germany on 3 april 1945 many of the people were on the streets to 
 wa e good bye the war diary of 3 april 1945 states never have we been moi welcome or experienced 
 more genuine hospitality than during our short stay ii belgium we concur wholeheartedly we bivouaced in the forest and noticed 
 many trees covered with shrapnel scars in the evening some of the troops walked out to kleve while others visite 
 i the reichwald forest war cemetery where 768 canadians are buried tuesday 1 august 1967 leaving at 0900 hours we 
 moved north to kleve crossed the rhine it emmerich and reached the dutch border at s herrenberg we were met 
 by our dutch liaison officer major w van der meer and a photographer who warml welcomed us to holland we 
 were then escorted to a training centre near zutphe i where we bivouacked the pioneer section arrived with assault boats 
 for the impending river crossing wednesday 2 august 1967 the three platoons went on short route marches to the surrounding 
 village of quatre bas harfsen and almen a reconnaissance of the river crossing area was made and the actual pillboxes 
 which the patricia s assaulted on the far sid of the river were observed with interest in the afternoon all 
 ranks were invited by the dutch to their respectiv messes and as usual we were overwhelmed by gifts and hospitality 
 on returning the oc gave orders for the next day s operation the crossin 
 81 of the ijssel river and the advance to the apeldoornsch canal the same code names used on the crossing 
 in 1945 were assigned thursday 3 august 1967 in 1945 the regiment crossed on 11 april and took 5 days 
 to reach the apeldoornsch canal we planned to do it one day in four phases phase 1 river crossing and 
 advance through wilp 4 platoon under 2 lt gieser crossed first in two boats with support sections in position to 
 give covering fire the river is 150 yards wide and quite fast but they made good time across and seized 
 the two bunkers the other platoons then passed through on ness where d company had been opposed by a tank 
 and two enemy sections they were greeted by an old man who said welcome canadians there are no jerries here 
 this time we advanced through wilp where the regiment had beaten back a strong enemy counter attack phase 2 advance 
 from wilp to alice blue gown platoons were sent out on two axes to the east edge of a large 
 wood then moved through it was thus on 13 april 1945 that the regiment inflicted 100 casualties and captured many 
 more b company assaulting across the ijssel river phase 3 swan south and advanced to klarenbeek support sections and reconnaissance 
 platoon were mounted and went south to feel out the country as the war diary states the company advanced on 
 foot to an area south of klarenbeek phase 4 klarenbeek to the crossing of the apeldoornsch canal advanced 0:ad 0:vanced 
 13 miles on foot clearing objectives along the way a hard day but the dutch army made our stay near 
 beekbergen pleasant by the provision of ameni 
 82 ties which included two tvs and we were able to see our river crossing on a programme they also 
 showed a film of the crossing in 1945 the dutch press radio and tv gave great publicity throughout friday 4 
 august 1967 move off and advanced 8 miles through reforested area which was open country in 1945 we bivouacked near 
 hoenderloo the dutch army once again provided all facilities which were superb the evening was spent by attending a carnival 
 in the village or going by truck to arnhem a delegation from the town of ede eight miles south west 
 requested the company march through their town the following day this was arranged as a good will gesture as the 
 regiment had not passed through ede in 1945 saturday 5 august 1967 a relaxing day after lunch a half hour 
 film was shown of the canadian advance in holland in the afternoon the company moved by vehic e into ede 
 our 3i o mile march over cobblestones with dutch bands playing in opposition was partially compensated for by free beer 
 courtesy of the dutch garrison in the evening some stayed in ede at a dance in the market hall whi 
 e others went to apeldoorn in response to an invitation drinks were free gir s were plentiful and all had 
 a marvellous time sunday 6 august 1967 no reveille today and brunch until noon several went to church in harskamp

 83 monday 7 august 1967 today we moved 15 miles 8 on foot through original objectives and 7 by vehicle 
 to the bivouac area 2 miles west of barneveld realism was added to our move on foot as we inadvertently 
 moved into a small arms range and were behind a stop butt when bursts of fire from smgs were heard 
 after a detour we arrived at harskamp on 17 april 1945 maj whj stutt and his carrier group had entered 
 the german officers mess at this camp and found food still hot on the table he took as souvenirs a 
 pipe and a sword which are now held in the regimental museum after lunch we moved to barneveld on 18 
 april 1945 the patricia s had relieved the loyal edmonton regiment and afforded left flank protection for the brigade at 
 1400 hours we formed up at the edge of town and marched through in column of route many rewarding sights 
 were seen canadian flags waving people cheering us and an old man with his arm around his wife crying and 
 waving a handkerchief we left barneveld and bivouacked two miles further on there was noticeably 0:notice 0:ably less walking out 
 in town in the evening as money was getting scarce achterveld remembers tuesday 8 august 1967 the afternoon was spent 
 in achterveld where the regiment had its last casualties where the war ended and where people have close ties with 
 patricia s as the regiment was there from 19 april to 8 may 1945 major stutt and his carriers were 
 the first canadians into the village on 19 april followed by the whole regiment by 23 april the company paraded 
 through the town with the usual enthusiastic spectators looking on we stopped at the town centre which b company occupied 
 
 84 many wore national costumes to honour the freemakers in 1945 and were addressed by dr braun a prominent physician 
 who remen bered the regiment with affection and who gave a stirring welcoming addres at our return to the bivouac 
 a broadcasting unit recorded a 10 minuu interview with a few of the company the humid weather brought hordes cf 
 wasps out and made life unpleasant in addition to a neighbouring manur spreader wednesday 9 august 1967 our first rain 
 during our trip fell today a few volunteers went to dutc l farms to work for the day after lunch 
 the oc 2ic and cpl anderson went t the home of the tymensen s outside achterveld the former site of

 significant as it was the first time that an army unit and an air force unit had received their colour 
 and squadron standard at the 
 94 same ceremony the loyal edmonton regiment were proud to act as co hosts with the 418 squadron city of 
 edmonton on this historic occasion the success of this event was attributed to the wonderful co operation given the two 
 units by the home station ppcli as the hamilton gault barracks were put at our disposal for several weekends before

 his highest marks in alberta in the master cadet examination in 1967 because of this he was selected for the 
 jamaican tour it is worth noting that our cadet corps won the nomination in 1964 65 66 and 67 my 
 trip actually began one day in may when i was informed that i had been selected to represent northern alberta 
 0:al 0:berta on the centennial cadet exchange trip to jamaica i had taken my master cadet test in april and 
 was waiting patiently for the results after finding out i was to go time passed slowly while the preparations took 
 place i was measured by the tailor for uniforms had a medical and two inoculations and i received my passport 
 0:pass 0:port certificate and all the papers which soon added up to a complete dossier which i had to carry 
 with me to cfb petawawa my first night in petawawa was chaotic new members arrived at all hours that night 
 i renewed old friendships and made new ones which were to last all summer the next ten days were typical 
 for an army camp we were kitted out had medicals 0:medi 0:cals and reviewed all our drill then we took 
 a national survival course for this was the subject in which we would instruct in jamaica during this time there 
 were clashes between cadets and instructors especially when you called colour sergeant taylor a staff sergeant the air was blue 
 for the next half hour then the big day arrived we were bussed to ottawa on friday night in order 
 to catch our plane on saturday morning no one slept that night for the excitement hung in the air like 
 a mist early saturday morning we boarded an rcaf yukon and our summer in the sun had commenced my first 
 perception of jamaica was a blast of heat as the plane door was opened we said hurried goodbyes to friends 
 who were to go on to other islands and made our way through customs during the first days at up 
 park camp we had more medicals and made more friends not on a teacherstudent 0:teacher 0:student basis but on a 
 cadet cadet level then training began we had to drill national survival into the jamaican 0:jamai 0:can trinidadian and barbadian 
 cadets for four hours each morning they were all hard working and good students 0:stud 0:ents therefore our job was 
 pleasant in the afternoons our time was our own on most afternoons tours were arranged for us one sunny day 
 we toured the red strip beer factory they also bottle pepsi and orange drinks it was refreshing especially in the 
 cooler because it was 85 outside another day we were packed on trucks and headed for a sugar plantation after 
 about two hours we jumped out of the trucks and ate raw sugar cane it would have been good if 
 we all had not got stomach aches the next day 
 106 that day we were told that the sugar cane was not ripe everyone remembers captain morgan the pirate we 
 actually saw his fort it was so real that you could almost hear the cannons exploding and the sabres clashing 
 of course we did a lot of swimming 0:swim 0:ming much time was spent in the blue caribbean which appears 
 as blue as it does in pictures however some days we went to the pool at the national stadium where 
 the commonwealth games were held this is surely one of the most beautiful pools in the world our most fun 
 filled day was when we travelled to the north coast the tourist area we were taken to dunns river falls 
 for a day of sunning and swimming the beach was pure white and the sea deep blue in colour part 
 of the fun was the trip on the bus there were sixty of us on a fortypassenger 0:forty 0:passenger bus 
 then came august sth independence 0:indepen 0:dence day if you thought we celebrated 0:cele 0:brated on july ist you should 
 have seen the jamaicans celebrate the celebrations were much more enthusiastic 0:enthusi 0:astic because they can still remember when they 
 became independent in 1962 all too soon it was time to return home as we flew home every one was 
 sad about leaving jamaica but the experience gained will remain with us always we arrived in petawawa at 3 00 
 a m thursday that day was very hectic because by 10 00 p m all sixty cadets were en route

 the battalion prepared itself for a move to 8a 0 r and for a complete change of role in addition 
 to the normal courses many extra drivers and signallers had to be trained to cope with our conversion from a 
 lightly scaled strategic reserve unit to an armoured infantry battalion we moved to iserlohn in germany during april and may 
 and joined 4th guards brigade we were happy to find 2nd bn princess patricia s canadian light infantry just down 
 the road shortly after we settled in we were entertained most magnificently by them we also received a more solid 
 present in form of lou and heather grimshaw in exchange for the grimshaws we have sent you david williams we 
 undoubtedly have had the best of the bargain our first few weeks in germany were spent in trying to adapt 
 ourselves to our new role without really enough apcs with which to do it however we acquitted ourselves well in 
 the series of summer exercises this was mainly due to the excellent standard achieved by our drivers and signallers in 
 a very short time in the competitive field we have made ourselves felt at hockey badminton sky diving and especially 
 boxing our boxing team had a very good run for its money and several of its members achieved individual championships 
 a green jacket team represented britain at the prix le clerc competition held in holland in 1967 though we came 
 fourth we gained much valuable experience for another attempt in 1968 due to the redeployment of the british army worldwide 
 we have had yet another move this time to trenchard barracks in celle as part of 7th armoured brigade the

 editor s note the author is now serving with the united nations in cyprus he served with the rcaf and 
 in the canadian infantry corps during world war ii and was later commissioned in the loyal edmonton regiment following his 
 transfer to the ppcli in 1952 he served in a number of regimental and administrative 0:adminis 0:trative positions in edmonton 
 germany camp borden and quebec city he i lso served with the un in the congo and was serving in 
 the directorate of operational readiness and evaluation at cfhq prior to his posting to cyprus he was loaned by the 
 dnd to the centennial commission for employment as governor of the route for the voyageur canoe pageant youppe youppe sur 
 la riviere vous ne m entendez guere youppe youppe sur la riviere vous ne m entendez pas it was often 
 to the tune of this song that hardy voyageurs paddled into the inner reaches of our continent as far back 
 as two hundred years ago and helped open up western canada and it has been fitting indeed to remember them 
 during our centennial year by retracing one of their routes from the eastern slopes of the rocky mountains through 3 
 283 miles of waterways to the fur trade centre of montreal sponsors the project of the voyageur canoe pageant was 
 jointly sponsored by the centennial commission the provincial and territorial governments and expo 67 all provinces and territories were represented 
 except newfoundland and prince edward island background the idea for a race from rocky mountain house to expo 67 originated 
 in edmonton and it bounced around for awhile before it finally caught the attention of the centennial commission who insisted 
 that it had to be run as a pageant in order to get its the commission s blessing trials carried 
 out since 1964 tested the endurance of men the adequacy of the equipment methods and 
 110 administration and proved to the commission that the trip across canada could be undertaken successfully a first run was 
 made in 1964 from kenora to sault ste marie by a couple of canoes a second run was made in 
 1965 by five canoes from north bay down the french river across the georgian bay through the trent canal system 
 and finally to gananoque at the eastern tip of lake ontario in 1966 ten canoes participated in a 600 mile 
 trial run down the fraser river to victoria and in a 450 mile run from lachine to sorel up the 
 richelieu river through lake champlain and down the hudson to new york city organization each participating province undertook to supply 
 a team of ten men one being a team manager and referred to as the provincial chief voyageur and the 
 remaining nine being the crew only six voyageurs paddled each day while the other three travelled by land in an 
 army loaned 3 ton truck these were responsible for lifting and setting camp washing clothes buying food and preparing the 
 grub it is interesting to note that the paddlers came from all walks of life miners farmers guides clerks trappers 
 musicians students railroaders and professional paddlers there was a doctor a lawyer an indian chief and a school principal to 
 boot the nwt team comprised mostly indians and eskimos while the armed forces were represented by two airmen in the 
 yukon team two sappers in the new brunswick team and squadron leader john mitchell as chief voyageur of the ontario 
 team equipment each canoe was named after an early explorer and the teams took great pride in this fact nova

 about 375 pounds they were made of fiberglass and were painted to resemble the birch bark canoes of old route 
 and itinerary the pageant started at rocky mountain house alberta on 24 may 1967 and finished at montreal on 4 
 september 1967 taking a total of 104 days the map shown above comprises the route and itinerary there can be 
 no doubt that the most picturesque country we travelled through was the quetico the wilderness area where the boundaries of 
 ontario and minnesota meet and the french river north of the georgian bay all communities where we stopped rivalled with 
 each other in displaying the welcome mat be it food or entertainment 0:entertain 0:ment and many out of the way 
 communities arranged their major centennial 
 111 celebrations to coincide with the passage of the voyageurs particularly interesting was the ceremony performed at the height of 
 land a couple of days before reaching 0:reach 0:ing grand portage on lake superior the time honoured ritual was performed 
 on all voyageurs and consisted of 1 taking a solemn oath not to kiss another voyageur s wife without first 
 obtaining her permission 2 downing a swig of rum 3 receiving a feather to indicate that one became an hivernant 
 or winterer in days of old the montreal run ended at grand portage and the voyageurs who returned to montreal 
 for the winter were referred 0:re 0:ferred to as pork eaters whereas the hivernants who continued the trip took to 
 a pemmican diet and wore a feather in their hat to distinguish them from the pork eaters method of travel 
 in order to cater to both the racing and pageantry aspects the following methods of travel were devised 1 lap 
 long distance race timed from start to finish there were 34 laps some of them as long as sixty miles 
 2 transit paddler s day the only stipulation was that the team must stick to the detailed route and arrive 
 at a given place by a specified time 3 brigade the grouping of canoes usually for safety purposes but occasionally 
 for show 4 sprint short races the longest was 3 miles at expo 67 put on in various communities for 
 the benefit of the spectators and often following a short demonstration on canoe handling prizes a set of rules was 
 devised and applied throughout the various stages of the pageant by appointed officials the timings were cumulative and the team 
 
 112 which arrived at expo 67 with the least accumulated time won the race the winning teams and prizes were 
 as follows ist manitoba 2500 per man 2nd b c 2000 per man 3rd alberta 1500 per man all other 
 teams received 1000 per man for completing the trip in addition 0:addi 0:tion to this each man received a subsistance 
 allowance of 8 00 per day and many communities put up cash prizes for the winners of the sprints the 
 average prize ran from 100 to 300 edmonton put up a 4500 prize the largest single cash prize of the 
 pageant and all voyageurs received a souvenir watch for their participation in the expo sprint officials the chief voyageur of 
 the pageant was none other than lieutenant colonel wild bill mathews a former patricia who retired from the canadian army 
 a year ago to take on the task of planning the pageant in its final details his main job was 
 carried out during the winter 66 67 and consisted 0:con 0:sisted in pinning down responsibilites whether federal provincial or municipal 
 with all the local dignitaries and arranging the itinerary and logistic aspect of the trip he was ably assisted in 
 this by a former edmonton football quarter back and sports commentator vie chapman whose main function during the summer was 
 that of co ordinating the activities of the administrative staff and of acting as master of ceremonies at the various 
 communities especially during the sprints as governor of the route my own responsibilities were those of co ordinating all water 
 activities a most enjoyable task despite the long hours of work and the lack of an adequately trained staff we 
 were assisted in our functions by an administrative staff consisting of a finance officer an assistant administrative officer a storeman 
 an advance party of two and three clerks one of whom was a piper also along for the ride were 
 four public relations types safety and assistance in addition to three 14 foot safety boats which were usually manned by 
 lt colonel mathews my assistant and myself we drew on a whole network of safety craft be it naval and 
 air as well as on the facilities of the search and rescue co ordinating centres of winnipeg and trenton credit 
 must be given to the royal canadian navy who provided two gate vessels on the great lakes and the canadian 
 coast guard who also provided a cutter the rcmp ontario and quebec provincial police the dept of lands and forests 
 from both manitoba and ontario as well as the us forestry service all helped in one way or another i 
 am also most grateful to the rcaf for providing me with a helicopter to reconnoiter the winnipeg river and the 
 lake of the woods communications last but not least a troop of signallers from t cdn sig regt now commanded 
 0:com 0:manded by an ex signals officer of 2 ppcli namely lt col buzz bennett was the nerve centre of 
 the pageant their task consisted in providing the following communications 1 between safety boats 2 from safety boats to shore 
 
 113 3 from safety boats to other supporting craft 4 from our mobile base to the centennial commission in ottawa 
 and 5 sending news releases from the accompanying pressmen to the canadian 0:canad 0:ian press news centre in toronto via 
 the armed forces communica tions system personal reminiscences from a military point of view it will be of interest to 
 note that i had to draw continually on my past experience as a physical training instructor on my knowledge and 
 experience in map using and patrolling as well as on basic administrative techniques and practice in making time appreciations my 
 interest was originally aroused by the geographical and historical implications of the voyage especially in view of my historical studies 
 i was amazed to discover that my greatest personal experience was not in those fields but in that of human 
 relations it was a delight to work with the paddlers simple men albeit from all walks of life with a 
 single purpose when dealing with the provincial chief voyageurs however one felt the political implication of their position and felt 
 a bit sorry for this as they were fine people as a rule and were fairly well versed in the 
 art of man management the support given by the rc sigs troop was of high professional calibre as well as 
 that given by the rcn and the coast guard and it was a pleasure to work with well trained and 
 efficient personnel understandably 0:under 0:standably there was a certain amount of friction when working with some of the untrained civilian 
 administrative staff much of which i assign to a fundamental misunderstanding of the aim of the pageant and a lack 
 of adequate qualification preparation training to do the assigned task under such rigorous conditions we were severely restricted by the 
 time table and by the budget and could not under these circumstances train these people and expect them to be 
 professional time keepers umpires and map readers at the same time some of the more interesting side lines from a 
 regimental point of view included a quick jaunt to the home station while passing through edmonton this coincided with the 
 loyal edmonton regiment s ball following the presentation of their colours by princess alexandra i also had pleasant unexpected meetings 
 with capt tony stoppa at cumberland house in north eastern saskatchewan with major bill hall in dauphin man with lt 
 col hal snelgrove lt col gordie gunton major paddy pyne and capt tom cory now rcapc in winnipeg i also 
 met major marcel marchessault in winnipeg he is now retired and in the insurance business i had a drink with 
 capt roy appleton on board hmcs porte st louis in port arthur and a chat with capt dave jones who 
 was passing through sault ste marie i met many other patricia s too numerous to mention in ottawa and montreal 
 this certainly drove home the fact that our regiment extends from coast to coast i was privileged in having dinner 
 one night with the famous historian dr grace lee nute author of the voyageurs the rainy river country the voyageurs 
 highway and other volumes of great interest on such a trip and felt most honoured when she autographed the first 
 of these volumes to my first live voyageur i shall always consider this trip as a highlight in my career 
 and sincerely hope that the mark it made across the country might in a small way and over the years 
 help in keeping our country united such is my fervent wish c est l aviron gui nous mene gui nous

 youngest canadian born soldier in the regiment young as he was twenty years old in had had some service in 
 the permanent 0:per 0:manent army regiment garrisoned on the citadel in quebec city the princess patricia s were completely mobilized 
 on august 19th and left ottawa on august 28th frank brown s father the rev s gorlev brown was the 
 minister in st andrew s presbyterian church in almonte 0:al 0:monte mr brown had not always been a clergyman he 
 started out as a school teacher married and worked as a printer until his health broke down when he recovered 
 he took his family to manitoba where he farmed for the next ten years but he had always had a 
 desire to enter the ministry and finally took the step he sold the farm entered the presbyterian college at montreal 
 and took a small mission church at the same time there were five children but recently one of his daughters 
 said the lord was truly with him for we always had plenty this writer remembers hearing mr brown preach a 
 sermon in which he stated unequivocally that he did not consider it sinful to go fishing or play catch on 
 a sunday afternoon you may smile but even as late as fifty years ago the time of the sermon was 
 1919 such an opinion expressed from a presbyterian pulpit bordered on heresy it is certain that some of the elders 
 of the church would hardly condone 0:con 0:done such irresponsibility it is true that the rev mr brown s son 
 frank was never a conformist perhaps 0:per 0:haps he came by it honestly frank brown s early years were spent 
 on his father s prairie farm he learned to ride a horse when very young and had his own bronco 
 which he rode bareback most of the time he had a 22 rifle when he was ten years old his 
 sister eileen says he was a crack shot and as we were poor he kept us in prairie chickens and 
 rabbits for food besides his prowess as a hunter and rider frank was also a precocious boy he matriculated at 
 fifteen and entered mcgill university when he was sixteen after several months of university life he quit he went to 
 quebec city where he enlisted in the rcr g coy at st louis barracks and of course had to lie 
 about his age but frank brown had one special qualification not possessed by the aver 
 116 age recruit he could blow the bugle and for a time he was the bugler while garrisoned on the 
 citadel he married a very beautiful girl whose parents were italian they were both eighteen years old a baby girl 
 was born to this marriage and because the mother was stricken with an incurable illness and unable to look after 
 the child the baby was adopted by her grandparents 0:grand 0:parents at the manse in almonte many in almonte remember 
 this little girl as the most beautiful child that they had ever seen on december 16 the princess patricia s 
 0:patri 0:cia 0:s were inspected in england by the king who was accompanied by lord kitchener as kitchener was passing 
 down the line and looking at the service ribbons of the men he said to colonel farquhar now i know 
 where all mv old soldiers have got to on december 20th they embarked for france to become 0:be 0:come one 
 of the battalions of the 80th brigade of the 27th division of the british army sergeant frank brown of no 
 3 company was not with them he was in hospital in england with influenza how he must have cursed his 
 luck no soldier was ever more anxious to get to the front in january 1915 on his release from hospital 
 he was granted the customary convalescent furlough and went of course to london in london he put up at the 
 veteran s club in high holborn and there met the founder of the club major arthur haggard who later gave 
 the following impression of sergeant brown he endeared himself to the members as he was an excellent pianist and had 
 a really good baritone voice and a good style of singing assisting two or three times at our concerts sgt 
 brown s sister told this writer frank had a glorious voice and played the piano well but never took a 
 lesson but on this his last leave in london there was a special errand that frank brown had his heart 
 on while with the rcr and princess patricias he had written 0:writ 0:ten some poems ballads and songs of the 
 great war some of which appeared 0:ap 0:peared in newspapers and periodicals his errand was to do what he could 
 to have these poems gathered between the covers of a book some months later a slim volume of poems titled 
 contingent 0:contin 0:gent ditties by frank s brown was published in london but sgt brown never saw a copy of 
 his book he may have had a premonition about that holbrook jackson editor of t p s weekly a literary 
 magazine in which a few of frank s poems had been published 0:pub 0:lished wrote i preface for the book 
 he wrote in january of the present year sergeant frank brown called at my office in covent garden with a 
 packet of poems under his arm his name was not unknown to me owing to the fact that he had 
 submitted some of his work to the literary critic who had in turn drawn my attention to it at the 
 time his regiment had proceeded 0:pro 0:ceeded to france but the soldier poet much to his disgust had been left 
 behind temporarily unfit through an influenza attack his two immediate wishes were to get to the front and to have 
 his poems published both wishes have now been gratified 0:grati 0:fied but sergeant brown lived only to enjoy the first 
 he was shot during his first day in the trenches at st eloi on february 3rd 1915 sgt brown s 
 company commander captain talbot m papineau wrote to rev s gorley brown at almonte telling of the death of his 
 son and of the esteem in which he was held like sgt brown capt papineau was one of the fewer 
 than ten per cent of the originals who were of canadian origin he was a grandson of louis joseph papineau 
 capt papineau wrote in part as you know your son was an expert shot 
 117 and he showed at once the most commendable 0:com 0:mendable enthusiasm in his work indeed 0:in 0:deed it was 
 this which caused his death during the first day he fired nearly eighty rounds at the enemy probably as much 
 as the rest of the company put together and undoubtedly attracted the attention of the german sharpshooters to himself at 
 3 30 that same afternoon he was struck in the head and died instantly and without pain that evening we 
 reverently buried him behind the firing line a short distance with his feet to a large tree and his head 
 to the enemy a wooden cross was erected to his memory sergeant frank brown died too soon he was twenty 
 one the ppcli princess pat s the trumpet sounded loud o er hill and plain to arms to arms our 
 empire is at war come join your colors on the land or main all britons who have served the king 
 before and in the mountain mine by prairie plow they answered to the trumpet s brazen voice they who had 
 served the empire long now as soldiers by profession and from choice no conscripts there in whose unwilling hands weapons 
 are thrust to wage unwilling strife but freemen all who needed not commands to volunteer their service limb and life 
 thus rose a regiment as neath a wand of seasoned men with medalled service too soldiers from every corps throughout

 the regiment vice patron mrs ah gault foreword it is a privilege to have the opportunity to extend greetings to 
 all past and present members of the regiment and to pay tribute to those who guard so zealously our traditions 
 and maintain them by keeping us in touch with one another each of us has a duty to perform in 
 this respect but the principal means of linking us is this excellent publication the preparation and distribution of which is 
 the work of the personnel at the depot no words can acknowledge adequately the unremitting toil on our behalf of 
 major bill stutt lieutenant vern cole and many others past and present who have made the patrician a binding force 
 beyond compare and an unending source of enjoyment we owe them a profound debt of gratitude the regimental tradition is 
 an inspiration to all infantrymen and especially to patricia s but what we thought was inviolate is in danger of 
 abolition unless we are vigilant this suggested abolition must be opposed by all possible means for with it will disappear 
 the basic structure representing the most significant experience of our lives the example and solicitude of our revered colonel in 
 chief who gave us her name the memory of hamilton gault the leadership of the colonel of the regiment general 
 ware will surely give us the strength to continue the fight for regimental identity would any of us wish to 
 be identified otherwise than as patricia s rowan coleman president princess patricia s canadian light infantry association

 west 19 avenue vancouver 8 b c edmonton branch the past year has been a successful one considering that the 
 branch was re activated only two years ago the paid membership has been increased over one hundred percent since re 
 activation in 1965 the enthusiasm displayed by attendance at general meeting and social functions is very encouraging general meetings are 
 held four times a year in the tv room ppcli home station sergeant s mess hamilton gault barracks the meetings 
 are scheduled for the first friday in the months of january march september and november the rules of order are 
 adhered to at general meetings and the business sessions are brief and constructive usually followed by a short entertainment period 
 such as films slides invited guest speaker etc favourable experience indicates that by maintaining this policy membership interest has increased 
 from year to year and the branch has experienced no drop outs one of the highlights experienced by the branch 
 members was the reactivation 0:re 0:activation of a dinner and smoker to commemorate the battle of frezenberg it was most 
 gratifying to register ninety five percent of our total membership in atendance alan macdonald presently the city solicitor for the 
 city of edmonon 0:edmon 0:on and formerly commanding officer of the loyal edmonton regiment was the invited guest speaker past 
 president dune mcdonell acting as toastmaster carried out his duties with the grace and dignity deserving this commemorable event as 
 a centennial project the branch presented the sergeants mess ppcli home station with a pen set mounted on a marble 
 base this beautiful gift will adorn the reception desk in the main entrance of the mess the branch is somewhat 
 disappointed with the response it has received in its request for assistance in compiling information for the purpose of writing 
 
 132 a history of ppcli bands the secretary asks that all information which may be helpful be forwarded to murray 
 church 13316 96a street edmonton for the first time edmontonians witnessed the trooping the colour ceremony by the first battalion 
 it was unfortunate that the weather took a turn for the worse during the ceremony nevertheless the battalion was magnificent 
 throughout their performance as was the old guard on their march past under the command of brigadier rc coleman they 
 were proud men indeed the branch mourns the untimely passing of comrade william bill gillespie he is remembered by his 
 many friends and comrades bill served proudly with the patricia s before transferring to the royal flying corps in world 
 war i on the basis of our favourable experience over the past year the executive looks to 1968 with optimism 
 and has scheduled an attractive program which predictably will see a larger increase in active and paid membership installation of 
 branch officers took place on january 6th 1967 they are as follows past president d c m dune mcdonell 11551

 toronto branch had another very successful year in 1967 we held our annual meeting on january bth at the royal 
 canadian military institute and while the attendance was not large it was enthusiastic after the business was disposed of john 
 kirby showed some very fine slides of his last trip to ypres and the battlefields of ww 1 we held 
 a luncheon meeting on march 17th to celebrate the birthday of the colonel in chief some 30 members attended including 
 a contingent from camp borden our 48th annual dinner was held in the king edward hotel on may 6th our 
 guests included brig rowan coleman and maj gen chris yokes who commanded the regiment in 1941 and has recently retired 
 our dinner commemorated 0:com 0:memorated the battles of vimy ridge 1917 and the hitler line 1944 about 15 of the 
 70 odd present had served at vimy and 10 at the hitler line our secretary attended the trooping of the 
 colour and annual meeting of the association at edmonton in october and reported a very fine trooping and a well 
 attended meeting a number of our members spent some time in hospital during the year and were visited by members 
 of the association while the formal functions of the branch are perhaps not as frequent as might be desirable there 
 is constant communication amongst the members and many informal meetings for example two of the members held a luncheon in 
 december to honour peck turner of victoria who was visiting toronto to celebrate his golden wedding some 25 attended all 
 wwi members who had served with peck another honoured guest was the colonel of the regiment maj gen cb ware 
 dso cd who was visiting toronto at the time the secretary reports that the paid up membership at the end

 another year we are still solvent we have plenty of enthusiatic members we have a good slate of officers we 
 have plans for several activities this year all of which augurs well for the year 1968 the two main events 
 of 1967 were the spring banquet and the fall smoker the dinner was held at the board of trade club 
 rooms in ottawa on 22 april 1967 to commemorate the occasion of the battle of kapyong there were 52 of 
 our own members in attendance in addition there were representatives from the toronto and montreal branches another significant social event 
 for us was our fall smoker which was well attended by both serving personnel and association members lan roe and 
 col hill represented the association at the ceremonies on november 11 at the national war memorial a wreath was laid 
 on behalf of the association ted mckay is still working on the scrap book which outlines the history of the 
 ottawa branch we still have many members on our nominal role who unfortunately never attend our gatherings this year our 
 president jim stone proposes to make a concerted effort to bring more of these strays back into the fold we 
 are indeed fortunate to have the enthusiastic co operation of the serving members of the regiment who are stationed at 
 armed forces headquarters our social encounters with the serving patricia s enables us to keep abreast of developments within the 
 regiment the officers and members of our branch of the association extend to all their fellow patricia s our kindest 
 personal regards and best wishes for future endeavours the attached nominal role shows our paid up members for 1967 and 
 1968 as usual our honourary colonel shuldham hill is the first member paid up for the new year he sets 
 an excellent example for all the youngsters in our branch

 147 montreal branch traditionally the montreal branch holds two meetings a year with a great number of personal contacts in 
 between and the past twelve months have been no exception the two dates were december ist last and march 21st 
 of this year we re a bit hidebound about other things too because we ve never been able to tear 
 ourselves away from the mcgill c o t c mess where so many memories and memorials of the regiment and 
 its founder abound both our meetings took the form of buffet dinners followed by short business sessions and war films 
 from the national film board at our last gathering we also had the pleasure of listening to a speaker major 
 jc devlin rca of hq mobile command 0:com 0:mand who spoke very knowledgeably about viet nam apart from the usual 
 strong and faithful contingent from the montreal area we have been fortunate in having welcome reinforcements from canadian forces base 
 st hubert indeed we owe much to captain art neadow and his colleagues in supplying films equipment a speaker and 
 themselves among serving patricia s and others stationed in montreal who have joined with us have been col george brown 
 major al wagstaffe major bill shuler capt art neadow major martin cracknell royal greenjackets and others in addition at our 
 last meeting we had visitors passing through in the shape of lt col owen brown lt col phil stayner major 
 eric sharpe major don robertson and capt dit roe another feature has been the presence of sons and young relatives 
 of patricia s many of them attending mcgill space does not permit a list of those montrealers who keep the 
 flag flying by constant attendance at meeting after meeting but our ranks are thinning the following comrades have passed on
