 fur traders as the chief of the beaver people of the fort vermilion area an alternate dene name provided by

 a wife a daughter and two snephews from the mid l 830 s on his health was poor but he
 was still able to bring in a good fur hunt on october 19 1841 for instance the journal noted the
 appearance of the old chief i e dents malfaits scarcely able to walk but of the land grant what the

 1830 s and 1840 s as reliable fur and meat producers for the post after 1840 they often hunted together
 and with members of le montagnier s family the migration of the cree into this area was a gradual process
 during the 1830 40 s parties of cree occasionally passed through the region travelling down loon river now called the
 wabasca river on their way to fort chipewyan frequent and longer visits were paid by two brothers baptiste and alexis
 auger to the fort vermilion and fort dunvegan areas during these decades these two brothers were described as being from
 the head of the loon river and were undoubtedly representatives of the auger family at trout lakes such visits turned
 into a migration north from the trout lakes 22 by the mid l 870 s a permanent group of cree
 occupied the lower loon river and little red river area 23 according to the hudson bay company records william shaw
 was in the company s service from 1839 to 1869 at various posts in the athabasca district including fort vermilion

 sole possessors of the little red river area this land is now part of the little red river cree traditional
 territory in the 1840 s the issue of territorial ownership below the chutes on the peace river appears to have
 been ambiguous there is an occasional reference in the post journals to meat cached at the chutes for the fort
 or of a family camped at the chutes but there is no reference to any fort vermilion family using the
 chutes area or the little red river area on an ongoing basis this area may well have acted as a

 evaluated as later took over the duties of a baker he excellent must have been good at it as for
 the next two years between july 1878 and july it is impossible to explain today what 1880 he had the

 one might in july 1880 for the first time in almost speculate that the young man suffered an five years

 dudney post journeys until december this period commander at fort union was removed was a very successful one for private
 from his position without justification in miniszewski he was appointed corporal 1877 due to personal animosities on july 5 1880
 and on november 15 he although he eventually was exonerated was promoted to the rank of sergeant through a court
 of inquiry and recovered strangely this latter rank was assigned his position the whole process lasted retroactive to july 5
 available three years it is doubtful that a young documents do not offer an explanation immigrant even if within his
 rights of this rapid change of his rank it is would have undertaken such action probable that the company experienced
 a perhaps it made mote sense to be found shortage of good men due to transfers unfit for duty this
 explanation seems to desertions and expiration of enlistment have certain merits as there was a contracts and his promotion was
 temporary change of the commanding intended to encourage him to enlist for officer of the company in the last two

 origin he was sometimes used as a translator alberta history winter 1999 and order in the territories badly needed good
 and experienced men wincenty miniszewski had no trouble on may 16 being accepted for service at the recruitment station in
 fort osborne near winnipeg a thorough medical examination did not reveal anything wrong except that he had been cupped on

 remarked a good man advise acceptance 6 in the enlistment form miniszewski gave his occupation as scout for the united
 states government his previous service as five years in united states cavalry and his character as excellent of these three
 pieces of information only the last one was true however there was pm obably no way at that time to
 check his record and north west mounted police officers often turned a blind eye on the past of experienced men
 for example captain r burton deane superintendent at regina recalled in his memoirs two notable engagements of charles ross and
 g p arnold both of these men had crossed the border from the united states in the summer of 1
 884 with the aim of taking up homesteads but changed their minds and enlisted in the mounted police during the
 medical examination it was discovered that while they were very fine specimens of miiuscular manhood they had scars from bullet
 wounds their explanations that they had been scouts for the united states army was not questioned by captain deane his
 comment to the medical exaniiner was as follows all right doctor if they have seen shots fired in anger they
 are the men for my money and if you say they are sound i shall engage them and take chances
 on their respectability 7 in 1885 the officers accepting recruits niust have been even more lenient than usual as colonel
 a g irvine complained in his annual report that too large a pi oportion of new men are unable to
 ride and are unaccustomed to horses despite the fact that the ability to ride well was one of the criterions
 of acceptance to the force the newly recruited constable was assigned to maple creek s a division at the outpost
 of medicine hat he remained there until his discharge from the force seven years later in 1892 the main purpose
 of the outpost was to keep order in the new settlements and to patrol the region from the cypress hills
 to the united states border where most of the liquor trafficking and horse and cattle stealing occurred riding the hilly
 area except in the winter months was a routine order of the day sometimes during the summer time no one
 was left at the post constable miniszewski probably performed regular duties but there also is evidence that because of his
 polish origin he was sometimes used as a translator for example when problems occurred in lethbridge in june 1888 that
 involved hungarian miners miniszewski was dispatched as an undercover detective to obtain evidence to suppress the illegal sale of liquor
 this duty required the constable to go under an assumed identity into a saloon for two or three evenings and
 to spend several hours in the company of beer drinkers in the end he was arrested together with a drunken
 hungarian miiier but his integrity was undermined during the trial when the miner accused miniszewski of interpreting falsely the complaint

 and for another service approximately thirty indicated their desire to accept christ as their saviour although gale declined to ask
 his listeners to make a decision at some services near the conclusion of the campaign there were reportedly as many
 as two hundred genuine converts judging from church membership numbers for the two churches where most of the nieetings were
 held the impact of the revival on calgai y was modest the church memberships were as follows central methodist 1906
 732 1907 1 058 1908 1 220 1909 1 235 and 1910 1 255 first baptist 1906 402 1907 417
 1908 470 1909 480 and 1910 484 for central methodist the rise of menibership from 1906 to 1907 was 326
 within the year of the great calgary revival the membership only rose 162 and the gains in the immediate years
 after the revival were hardly significant for first baptist the rise of membership was fairly significant there were 53 added
 to the membership during 1908 much more than the previous year although the numbers did level off as was the
 case for central methodist in the two years after the revival one of the main purposes of a revival campaign
 was to reach out to the increasing number of unchurched in urban centres 2 but in the early twentieth century
 when calgary s population was growing rapidly the gale hatch meetings did not appear to gemierate a large increase in

 that the article jim the calgary albertan large and ornate central methodist march 19 1908 exemplified respectability above a common
