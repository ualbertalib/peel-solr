 f alberta s v ‘ ‘ 11 i by sharon richardson reproductive health care for pioneering women on the canadian
 prairies was a major problem throughout the first fifty years of the twentieth century the prairie provinces of saskatchewan and
 alberta were the last agrarian regions in canada to be settled the largest wave of settlement began at the turn
 of the twentieth century and peaked in 1911 increasing the population of female inhabitants tenfold within a decade major obstacles
 to safe birthing for homestead women on the prairies included the lack of trained doctors nurses and midwives long distances
 to travel to obtain whatever help was available primitive living conditions an absence of hospitals and maternity homes for difficult
 confinements and women s own limited knowledge of the birth process until about 1924 maternal and infant mortality was higher
 on the canadian prairies than most other regions and alberta had the highest rates in the country in 1921 the
 report on maternal mortality rates prepared by the federal government in 1925 showed maternity as the second leading cause of

 in remote parts of alberta from 1924 to 1931 and from 1934 to 1942 the l 930 s was a
 period of crisis for albertans as they experienced the most intense economic depression the greatest class and political conflict and
 the most labour and social violence compounded by the slowest population growth and the greatest changes in agriculture in the
 province s history the average per capita income in the province declined from 548 in 1928 to 212 in 1933
 well below the national average 35 in august 1935 the protestant fundamentalist social credit party replaced the united farmers of
 alberta as the provincial government and began laying the framework for a social welfare state social credit was led by
 william aberhart creator of the calgary prophetic bible institute a radio evangelist and principal of calgary s largest high school
 although his detractors considered aberhart a vain authoritarian short tempered man whose oratorial abilities far exceeded his intellectual capabilities he
 was deeply distressed by the poverty and experience and training were preferred as district nurses but were difficult to recruit
 especially during the second world war a few were either british midwives or went to england and scotland during the
 1930 s purposely to take the midwifery course 27 a number of canadian trained district nurses had either post graduate
 hospital courses in obstetrics or extensive experience in hospital obstetrical units olga freifeld a refugee from the bolshevik revolution was
 a russian trained feldsher nonetheless a number of others learned on the job until the advanced practical obstetrics program was
 instituted at the university of alberta in 1943 to provide midwifery training for district nurses among these district nurses were

 service grew gradually from an initial three nurses in 1919 10 5 x in 1923 and eight by 1934 15
 in july 1921 the ufa replaced the liberals as the provincial government the financial position of the newlyelected ufa party
 was extremely weak because of debt inherited from the previous liberal administration and an economic recession resulting from declining prices
 paid farmers for their wheat and beef 11 as part of an overall program of economy the new ufa government
 reduced the nursing staff of the department of health initially to twenty public health nurses and finally in 1923 to
 six public health nurses but did not reduce the number of district nurses l 7 under the ufa government from
 1921 to 1935 district nurses continued to provide care to homesteaders by answering emergency calls taking charge of obstetrical cases

 under aberhart state medicine was an integral part of the social credit platform from 1935 until his death in office
 in 1943 one reflection of aberhart s commitment to state medicine was the doubling in number of district nurses fmom
 eight in 1934 to fifteen in 1936 4 the second world war precipitated further expansion of the district nursing service
 with the outbreak of war in 1939 many doctors left their rural practices to enlist and communities which pi eviously
 had several doctors suddenly found themselves with only one 4 to meet the needs of these rural areas the district
 nursing service was increased dramatically to twenty five in 1939 and then more gradually to thirtysix by war s end
 in 1945 many of the new district nurses lacked adequate obstetrical training to manage home births and to identify complicated
 pregnancies amid deliveries requiring physician s intervention to address the increased demand for trained nursemidwives in 1943 the university of
 albeita began offering a three month course in advanced practical obstetrics through its school of nursing the course was developed
 by former district nurse helen mcarthur as her thesis for a master s degree at teachers college columbia university new
 york and was specifically designed for district nurses 43 in addition to prenatal examination conduct of normal delivery and postnatal
 examination students were taught repair of episiotomy and perineal nerve block because district nurses often were unable to obtain medical
 help when needed 44 field experience was provided by about thirty doctors mostly in the southern part of the province
 where hospitals were small and there were no medical students and internes students were required to deliver at least twenty
 babies under the supervision of their physician field guides 45 the district nursing service was expanded in 1950 by the
 nursing service act and renamed the municipal nursing service 41 its purpose remained essentially unchanged municipal nurses continued to provide
 emergency treatment obstetrical supervision home nursing immunization and environmental sanitation in sparsely populated areas distant from medical and hospital services
 47 each municipal nurse had either a telephone or a twoway radio link with the alberta forestry service to obtain
 medical advice when needed if municipal nursing districts overlapped with rural health unit boundaries the municipal nurse came under the
 supervision of the medical officer of the health unit in addition to reporting to the director of public health nursing
 in the department of public health municipal nurses could be hired either by a municipality or by the department of
 public health a locally appointed nursimig service committee was responsible for maintaining the nurse s cottage and providing her transportation
 and supplies cost of the municipal nurse and her programs was shared 60 per cent by the province and 40
 per cent by the alberta history winter 1998 5 i 5 i 1 5 s ‘ 4 5 4 health
 services previously provided by municipal nurses increasingly came under the sponsorship of local health units by 1962 there were twenty
 four local health units each with a staff of a medical officer of health four public health nurses a sanitary
 inspector a secretary technician and a part time secretary treasurer to serve an average population of 27 000 5 municipal
 nurses declined in number from thirty seven in 1951 to twelve in l 965 by the mid 1 960 s
 municipal nurses rarely attended home confinements the district nursing service and its successor the municipal nursing service officially came to
 an end in 1976 with the phasing out of the position of provincial director of public health nursing 5 municipality

 several months into a freight car went furniture household effects trunks and boxes full of clothing and bedding farm implements
 and tools and even a wagon some horses and cattle were sent in a separate box car in 1899 the
 westling family including anna and erick daughter annie and husband peter wickenberg and children daughter hilda and husband lars bloomgren
 and children sons axel and august arrived in what came to be called the westling district by 1898 anna and
 erick were the parents of nine children seven sons and two daughters due to hard work clever management and erick
 s inventive mind the westling family was fairly prosperous as experienced farmers with solid financial backing erick was sure they
 would have no problems with canadian immigration authorities anna continued to have doubts about leaving their comfortable farm home and
 swedish speaking neighbours so erick said he would go first and find out what the western canadian prairies were like
 erick and one of his older sons made the trip to western canada and returned with glowing tales of what
 was now being called the last best west there were thousands of acres of homestead land still available the country
 was dotted with pure sparkling lakes teeming with fish wild fowl deer and elk and other animals were there in
 abundance but best of all as far as erick was concerned western canada had some of the best soil that
 had ever trickled through his fingers but anna still had a few questions what about the indians she was told
 peter and annie wickenberg were grandparents of ben farnham of edmonton this large group travelled to their new home in
 an immigrant coach these coaches were fitted with stoves at one end so that immigrants could do some simple cooking
 on the journey the seats fitted so that they could be used as beds the westlings had no problems at

 us and set up tents and we lived in kept their families well supplied those for a while it was
 great fun for us children but not for the grown ups with deer wild ducks geese because shortly after we
 arrived it started to rain and it rained almost prairie chicken ruffed grouse steadily for seven weeks and rabbits wild
 raspberries in spite of the rain lumber was clive or lacombe the settlers never brought in from lacombe and a

 the women canned or made jams and jellies with the a day my mother always said that in spite fruit
 and often processed any extra meat of so many of us living together it in scalers was one of the
 happiest years of her life all us kids slept up in the loft erick and his sons brought with them

 but that caused no problems for anna or erick erick as the westlings had arrived in july it tanned animal

 be in the westling district my mother roaming around the westling district and then dyed that material red and made
 everyone was warned to beware of him me a beautiful dress i had a yellow anna had spent a busy
 day baking bread skirt made the same way pies and cookies and had stored them safely she thought in a
 back porch another thing grandma and mother cupboard while she was taking samples and other women did was to hook
 rugs of this delicious fare to the men in the can you believe it in a few years we fields
 the bear raided the cupboard and had rugs in nearly every room what ate nearly everything anna was so they
 did was to hook a number of angry she vowed it would be a sorry day smaller mats then sew
 them together for him if he ever came back the bear to make a large rug straw was put on
 was not impressed he did come back the floor to act as an underpad and the and anna saw him
 trying to kill a pig rug laid on top of that she picked up a huge frying pan and screaming
 and shouting rushed at him about twice a year the rugs were with the pan upraised luckily for anna taken
 up picked apart washed then the terror stricken bear fled into the sewn together again fresh straw was shelter of
 the surrounding woods put down and once again the big rug was put on the floor it was a lot

 hack howay conducted his analysis with the help of two men surveyor j b daniel a kyba tyrrell and j
 m wardle chief engineer of canadian national parks tyrrell was the man who discovered david thompson and was at the
 time the in june 1 801 david thompson tried to person most familiar with his diaries and cross the rocky
 mountains in a attempt movements wardle s role was to to locate the columbia river and to provide some local
 knowledge of the open trade with the kootenay indians ram river region the general route of this attempt is well
 known and has been reviewed by several the identification of onion lake as historians the consensus is that he left
 thompson s furthest point of travel up rocky mountain house and ascended the north ram river has been either the
 north rain river at a lake near the unquestioned or ignored richard north ram s headwaters the expedition glover does
 not mention onion lake was turned back by impassable terrain while victor hopwood does barbara and a lack of supplies
 which was belyea repeats the onion lake assertion exasperated by the size of the party but hedges her bets by
 mentioning the thompson then followed the north ram small unnamed lake ne of whiterabbit back to the north saskatchewan there
 creek 4 in the end she takes howay s his attempt to ascend the north position that it is difficult
 if not saskatchewan river by canoe was impossible to trace exactly the route turned back by the spring runoff followed
 by thompson under the blind thompson returned to rocky mountain direction of his ignorant and craven house and put most
 of the blame of the guide 5 the scholarship of belyea expedition s failure upon his guide a glover etc
 is admirable what they lack cree indian whom he called the rook is knowledge of the country thompson covered and
 perhaps experience in thompson s account of his first attempt wilderness travel since it is possible to to cross the
 rocky mountains was first not only trace accurately thompson s published in 1 933 3 the editor f w route
 but to question whether the rook howay outlined thompson s journey up was as ignorant and craven as he is
 the north rain river and identified assumed to be alberta history winter 1998 they returned to rocky mountain house on
 june 30 before tracing and discussing thompson s first attempt to cross the rocky mountains several points should be briefly
 reviewed firstly thompson was leading a trading expedition to the kootenay indians in southeastern british columbia their plan was to
 ascend the north saskatchewan river and to cross howse pass into british columbia 1 their decision to leave the north
 saskatchewan in favour of the north ram must be viewed therefore in the light of understanding that they had intended
 to return to the north saskatchewan secondly thompson likely had a good idea where he was going a year earlier
 he had sent two traders le blanc and la gassé 0:gasse up the north saskatchewan and across howse pass into the
 kootenay country they returned to rocky mountain house on may 23 l 80 l two weeks before thompson set off
 on his expedition thompson does not mention the return of the two men but it is inconceivable that they did
 not brief him in regards to the route they had followed thirdly regarding thompson s modern reputation as a surveyor
 his calculations for latitude and longitude are usually fairly accurate direction of travel was established by compass and distances were
 usually estimated on the basis of elapsed time these observations especially his estimates of distance show great inconsistency 5 this
 is consistent with what is found in howay also in howay thompson s compass readings including directions of travel are
 by magnetic north i ather than true north in 1801 the angle of magnetic declination was about 25 e this
 paper s directional comments will be by true north 9 keeping these points in mind and as presented in howay
 thompson s travels alberta history winter 1998 thompson s route is as follows he and his party left rocky mountain
 house on june 6 1801 they ascended the north saskatchewan river by following the north bank towards chambers creek from
 this creek they headed west towards the vicinity of the mouth of jackfish creek here they crossed over to the
 south bank of the north saskatchewan and moving crosscountry in a southwesterly direction came to the foot of the brazeau
 range in the vicinity of lundine or trout creek unable at this point to break through the brazeau range they
 backtracked several miles then swung southeast along the foot of the range until they came to rough creek they followed
 rough creek up to its headwaters went through the brazeau range and descended nice creek to the north ram river
 they followed the north rain up to a small unnamed lake 5204 30 n 1 16 l 7 25 w
 then turned around and descended the north ram back to the horburg flats on the north saskatchewan from there a
 portion of thompson s party returned to rocky mountain house meanwhile thompson and his remaining party tried to go upstream
 by canoe but were turned back before the gap in the brazeau range by thick deadfall and the river s

 put up on the banks of a this is early in the season for mountain brook which tra verses the
 meadow travel typically the ground would be about 1 mile s w of us flows the wet and the streams
 high due to the saskatchewan river spring runoff at higher altitudes there would be snow on the ground and passes
 thompson leaves the north could still be blocked in 1801 the west saskatchewan and heads northwest was in the little

 the mountains and discover the take the horses and return to rocky columbia river but the arrangements mountain house heavy
 rains delay were such that i saw plainly the whole thompson s attempt to go up river until was hopeless
 mr hughes engaged a mr hughes now proposed to them to send back the horses with our indian guide as
 much of the baggage as we could possibly do without what we took with us to be equally divided among
 the whole of us alberta history winter 1998 the rook was the expedition s last minute and perhaps reluctant choice
 of guide the original guide a kootenay had been killed en route to rocky mountain house by the stoneys allies
 of the cree the rook had to be enticed into the job with in thompson s words large promises if
 he performed his part well severely threatening him if he did not 9 according to fidler the rook was afraid
 of being killed by the kootenays this is reasonable rook was a cree the cree s allies the stoneys had
 just killed a koolenay thompson s would be guide who was under the protection of le blanc and la gassé 0:gasse
 as payback even under thompson s protection rook s life might be forfeit if he fell into the hands of
 the kootenay when one examines the route taken the rook s ability does not appear as bad as thompson portrays
 it he successfully guided thompson around the windfall barrier and through the brazeau range he put them on a trail
 along the north ram river either through ignorance or misjudgment he did not stay on the lower ground and thus
 bring his party back to the north saskatchewan instead he continued to climb the north ram the rook did try
 to have the expedition aborted but was overruled by thompson and hughes we told him rook plainly that we were
 too far advanced to think of returning why said he at all events we cannot go much farther some of
 our horses are already quite feeble others nearly crippled and we have still the worst of the mountain to pass
 after they reached the unnamed lake and found the way past it blocked it was not just the rook who
 wished to turn around but also thompson s men faced with a potential mutiny thompson and hughes had no choice
 but to return regarding the ravine s impassability the rook is cori ect when he says that while he did
 not travel the route by horse i thought where we had gone on foot horses might possibly go 2 a
 month later with the snow gone thompson s expedition could have nahathaway indian guide who conducted thro defiles which at
 length had no outlet and we returned and thus ended the business of l 80 l thompson s opinion of
 the rook and his professional ability is extremely negative a man so timourous by nature of so wavering a disposition
 withal so addicted to flattering lying as to make every thing he said or did equivocal doubtful 2 he further
 claims as quoted in the previous paragraph that even before the expedition began it was doomed to failure due to
 the presence of the rook so who was the rook to begin one cannot be certain of his real name
 rook means raven corvus corax thompson was born and raised in london england his choice of the word rook rather
 than raven may be simply his dialectical preference but it is interesting since rook carries with it the connotation of
 a swindler or cheat as in to rook someone this meshes with thompson s negative opinion of the man in
 contrast peter fidler says the guide s name was crow crow corvus brachyrhymmchos is not only a very different kind
 of bird but like the raven does not carry the rook s negative connotation above the author is seemi looking
