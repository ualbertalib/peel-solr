 the patrician 8 andrew hamilton gault a memoir by lt col ret g r stevens obe early in august 1914 
 the little prairie hamlet of provost lay basking in the midsummer heat through the drowsy afternoon came the sound of 
 singing two university of alberta students one a summer teacher and the other an itinerant baseball player who had made 
 a rendezvous in order to shoot some prairie chickens saw a man with a packsack across his shoulders staggering down 
 the centre of the street heading for the railway station they were told that it was frenchy a homesteader from 
 out in the dim hills to the northeast and that he was drunk again so he was but this time 
 for a different reason he had given his horses and cow to a neighbor and had left his grain standing 
 the song that he sang was la brabanconne the national song of belgium he had been called up and was 
 on his way to rejoin his regiment before another spring he was dead among the unpulled sugar beets in a 
 muddy field in flanders all that night the two students sat in the station master s office the telegrapher for 
 security was yet to be thought of read them the news that blazed over the wires germany had invaded france 
 and belgium britain had declared war the royal navy which had not been demobilized since the spithead review a score 
 for that brash if brilliant thruster winston churchill had slipped away to battle stations in the mists of the north 
 sea the clash so long described and destined to change the face of the western world was imminent next morning 
 the students decided that the prairie chickens must wait they took the first train to edmonton and as soon as 
 the legion of frontiersmen who had undertaken to find a company for a new regiment 0:regi 0:ment to be raised 
 by a montreal millionaire were clear of the town they enlisted in the 19th alberta dragoons whose home station was 
 strathcona now edmonton south they were issued with broomsticks in lieu of rifles and red monkey jackets with pot cleaners 
 on the shoulders and they set to work on the cavalry manual for a horse soldier in those days looked 
 down from a great height on a foot slogger while they trained they returned to the university where they were 
 better known as athletes than as scholars that autumn they played on the team that won the provincial football championship 
 on the evening of victory jock parker their football captain said goodbye and left to rejoin his regiment he too 
 was dead before another season the alberta dragoons had no lances no sabres and although around christmas carbines were issued 
 there was no ammunition for them by spring most of the university sportsmen were in the forces and fed up 
 with waiting then came the electrifying news of the first gas attack and the magnificent stand of the canadian brigades 
 on the shell torn ridges beyond ypres they saved the situation said the war office but at bitter cost a 
 notice went up on the board in athabaska hall that the first universities company was assembling at niagara on the 
 lake to reinforce 
 the patrician 9 princess patricia s canadian light infantry the university authorities advanced the date of convocation the military people 
 quickly made the necessary transfers on a clear spring evening the city of edmonton gave the first flight to leave 
 for the east a tumultuous farewell first universities company had gone and second was filling up when the edmontonians arrived 
 the new lot shifted to the mcgill campus in montreal and three weeks later marched down beaver hall hill to 
 the docks nine days later their ship came up plymouth hoe with cheering crowds on either side for canada was 
 a good word in english mouths the four brief weeks at sir john moore s plain were chiefly memorable for 
 the first recorded utterances of the immortal john collins get rid of that man he offends my sight make him 
 an officer won t have him swanking around in my squad with a lance stripe dont any of you bloated 
 sons of montreal millionaires or bank clerks from saskatoon tell me that you ve lost any article that his majesty 
 with lamentable lack of foresight has entrusted to you go and steal someone else s before the next kit inspection 
 then another night march to the docks a crossing to le havre and a pleasant cruise up the seine with 
 the chateaux of normandy on the high ground along the river then into the eight horses forty men boxcars and 
 so at a snail s pace to flanders on the banks of the lys almost exactly at the spot where 
 the three musketeers cut off lady de winters head these young and proud but very imperfect soldiers were taken into 
 the body of the regiment taken in is an exact description in more ways than one the originals old soldiers 
 almost to a man looked on the college boys as lambs and proceeded to fleece them they named the newcomers 
 posey wallahs which was hindustani for jam eaters jam was a new item in british army rations and the old 
 sweats regarded it as only fit to be traded to the frenchies for something that mattered such as wine or 
 cognac to eat the stuff as the newcomers did was too serious to be passed over soon the stories were 
 going the rounds a characteristic canard was that the patricia s had more trouble than anyone else in keeping their 
 trenches clear of rats every time they baited a rat trap with jam they found a mcgill student in it 
 yet in spite of this sort of thing there was a good deal of rough kindness among the old sweats 
 and in september when the regiment swung away on a long trek southward to the somme many a night march 
 ended with a newcomer carrying two rifles or two packs although wild horses would not have dragged it from them 
 the veterans and the recruits were pleased with each other then one morning there was an unwonted stir at battalion 
 headquarters in the main street of the village and the word quickly was passed around that the man everyone had 
 heard so much about major hamilton gault had returned to duty after his second wound of the war he was 
 tall straight and strong with an unmistakeable air of command 0:com 0:mand yet he was without aloofness when you snapped 
 that salute so that your shoulder socket clicked he stopped to pass the time of day

 the patrician 11 just as if salutes were something special he owned the university boys from the moment that they 
 first saw him and his proprietarial rights were such that when imperial officers came around offering commissions to all and 
 sundry in kitchener s new armies most of those who received such offers said that they would rather stay where 
 they were there were other outstanding officers in the regiment buller tall intense and dedicated pelly every inch a soldier 
 charley stewart who roistered the nights away agar adamson the ackety ack of a hundred eccentricities all of whom were 
 destined in course of time to come to command there was talbot papineau already a public figure and in the 
 eyes of many a potential prime minister of canada hugh niven with nerves of steel and van den berg the 
 soldier of fortune among the newly arrived were such fine canadians as percy molson george mac donald george currie and 
 phillip mackenzie in the ranks and awaiting promotion were many destined to leave their mark on the regiment a g 
 pearson who rose from corporal to colonel hugh mackenzie the fiery highlander who died on the slopes of gravenstafel ridge 
 in winning the victoria cross mike ten broeke jimmy carvosso jimmy edgar and many others yet even amid such quality 
 hamilton gault stood out as a model of the happy warrior and the recruits saw him as an ideal in 
 the flesh the man that each of them would wish to be that autumn after a blooding on the somme 
 the regiment said good bye to its stout hearted british comrades and moved north to join the canadians in flanders 
 there they took over terrain familiar from their first months in the line hooge china wall and sanctuary wood throughout 
 the winter the bickering with the enemy grew in intensity and hamilton gault ever roaming the front line became an 
 intimate symbol of leadership a typical instance was one night in the late winter when d company held a line 
 of shell holes linking up with the guards division on the left a box barrage came down isolating the company 
 enemy bombers working forward over the rubble heaps sought to close the air was filled with cylindrical sticks and the 
 driving bands of the high explosive shells then through the crash and roar came a cheerful shout and gault was 
 there bidding all remember that they were masters of the field and that they could not be overthrown when the 
 enemy had packed up and made off he remained to drink a cup of tea with some very proud young 
 soldiers he toasted them and so neither for the first nor the last time made them his own but that 
 was probably the last time that he ever came bursting into a battle for within a few weeks they carried 
 him out with his third wound and a leg shattered beyond repair but his spirit was unspent one of the 
 university company men boys no longer went to see him in hospital and found him deep in plans for a 
 saddle which would hold his stump secure so that he might be enhorsed once more in the autumn when on 
 the bloody approaches to courcelette the patricia s with charley stewart roaring in the van made and held their ground 
 gault s messages to the regiment rang like a hunting horn refuting his contention that he was now no more 
 than a gentleman in england still abed 
 the patrician 12 next spring he was back doing something on third canadian division staff when questioned by a junior 
 officer he maintained with mock humility that he was running a school for army cooks which may or may not 
 have been the case that summer the regiment again on certain occasions had him in command on an august night 
 in front of vimy a shoot came down he immediately headed for the front line far down the communications trench 
 his voice could be heard bidding all to be of good cheer for the rest of the war he was 
 never very far away and on many mess nights he rose in his place an idolized and dauntless figure after 
 mons he took command once more the old sweats and the university boys alike had had their day and only 
 their remnants remained out of the university of alberta s hockey team five had died with the regiment including the 
 great player who had seen frenchy stagger down the street in provost yet gault s enrichening spirit had infused those 
 who followed them and the regiment had taken on the qualities that endows it to this day while it lay 
 in flanders where it crossed to england 0:eng 0:land for the joyous ceremony of its sponsor s marriage when it 
 took ship for home when it kept step for the last time as it crossed parliament hill to the point 
 of disbandment those in high places had decided that something had been created that was too precious to be destroyed 
 that canada owed it to herself and to her commonwealth associates to preserve the spirit and tradition of this great 
 company as a result the regiment only ceased to exist for eleven days when re born in the permanent forces 
 its founder once more was in command nursing the infant unit through its teething stage when that was done he 
 felt his task to be ended but symbols live on after men depart and his influence was never greater than 
 when he was gone it grew almost impossible to embark on any regimental enterprise without first satisfying the inevitable question 
 what would hammy think about it he thus retained a voice which he exercised with discretion and generosity he retired 
 to england where he found a lovely wife a daring horsewoman a skilled aviatrix and made his home in the 
 rolling somerset countryside where the quantock hills filled the western horizon an unsought seat in the house of commons came 
 to him and the years between the wars were full and good years his constituents 0:con 0:stituents were as much 
 his charge as his men in the field had once been he and his wife flitted casually about the world 
 in their two seater aircraft in the house of commons he was an unmistakeable figure seldom on his feet but 
 active behind the scenes yet his greatest joy still remained his old soldiers and he retained his right to give 
 them a tickingoff 0:ticking 0:off if they came to britain and did not report their whereabouts to him he took 
 them to lunches in the house or brought them down for dinners at hatch court and on such occasions the 
 old names were recalled lovingly and the myths began to grow about the memorable times and the figures of the 
 past the wide humanity indeed the compassion that is characteristic 0:character 0:istic of so many great soldiers was implicit in 
 gault s outlook it earned him friends everywhere and sometimes in unexpected places for instance when one of his subalterns 
 was asked whom he would like to meet at tea 
 the patrician 13 on the terrace some imp of the perverse impelled the visitor to select jimmy maxton the glasgow 
 radical who was reputed to have the sharpest tongue in the house yet if he expected fireworks he was sadly 
 mistaken 0:mis 0:taken tory squire and socialist firebrand were on the best of terms and took delight in chaffing each 
 other perhaps his only unhappiness in those days was when his thoughts turned to the regiment the story now has 
 been told in detail how between the wars the patricias like all permanent force units were starved into a skeleton 
 force in which make do was the order of the day and in which only the devotion of officers and 
 senior ranks kept the spirit unbroken throughout the hungry thirties gault remained the fountainhead 0:fountain 0:head of regimental inspiration in 
 a battle as grim as any in the field he never ceased to proclaim that if yesterday was bad and 
 today worse tomorrow 0:to 0:morrow assuredly must be better on the outbreak of war in 1939 he was the first 
 volunteer to report to the regiment he passed to a staff appointment but as in the first world war he 
 was never far away and his pride in the patricias was unquenchable i hate to admit it he wrote to 
 a first world war comrade but the new lot is just as good as the old and i know when 
 they take the field that i shall be known as an insufferable boaster a former officer on appointment to the 
 indian army asked gault to obtain permission 0:per 0:mission for him to wear the patricia badges it was forthcoming but 
 he warned the recipient now my lad you have something to live up to his letters in their bold flowing 
 script displayed the same indomitable spirit that had sent him plunging into the forefront of the battle a quarter century 
 before when the bugles blew truce at achterveld his congratulations were couched in the familiar vein the old guard salutes 
 the new guard god bless you all in the fullness of days he returned to his summer home in canada 
 it was perhaps less the land of his birth than his old soldiers which drew him there as for them 
 the cottage beside the mountaintop 0:moun 0:taintop lake at st hilaire became little less than a shrine they came to 
 re tell their old tales and for the afternoon to be patricia s once more on two occasions the old 
 hands gathered in their hundreds to greet him in september 1953 he held court at calgary for those who were 
 bound to him in a fealty that would not pass in may 1955 three thousand old sweats and their relatives 
 crammed massey hall to the roof in a tribute to him that night he took away a parchment bearing the 
 signatures of more than seven hundred who had been proud to serve under him this sort of thing was out 
 of date nowadays gaffer is as good as squire if not better but as long as the human story unfolds 
 there will be men who stand out from the commonalty men under whom it is a precious privilege to serve 
 men whose courage integrity and gaiety resounds like a trumpet blown amid the hills awakening echoes in the hearts of 
 all who hear such a man was hamilton gault those who must journey henceforth and alone have need of stout 
 convoy new great heart is gone

 the patrician 16 sometime in 1916 this scotswoman a direct descendant of rob roy macgregor and her mother who owned 
 a private hotel at 34 beford place in london had as their guests three or four members of the ppcli 
 these boys on their return to france from leave told their friends of the warm hearted hospitality and friendship they 
 had received at 34 these friends came to bedford place in their turn and when back with the battalion told 
 of the welcome they had had at what they soon came to call their london home the thing went on 
 and on until by the end of the war the number of soldiers who had enjoyed the hospitality of this 
 unique establishment ran into several thousands men from australia new zealand and south africa were there as well as canadians 
 from many units but the bulk of the visitors were patricia s on the 21st of august 1938 jennie arrived

 the patrician 17 presentation of new colours lt rm macintosh it has been learned that her majesty the queen has 
 approved the presentation of her colours to the ist battalion ppcli thursday 17 july 1959 thus read the signal received 
 by the commanding officer of the ist battalion of the regiment on 18 april 1959 this momentous message 0:mes 0:sage 
 touched off a series of preparations which led to her majesty s presentation of colours to the battalion three months 
 later during these three months the training programme of the battalion was changed considerably before the announcement the aim of 
 the programme 0:pro 0:gramme had been to ready the battalion for the annual concentration at wainwright the programme was now 
 modified so the battalion could prepare for the initial honour of receiving colours from the reigning monarch various committees were 
 formed to determine the ceremonial drill to follow the guests to be invited and the arrangement of seating and parking 
 no half measures were taken each member of the battalion felt that here was a ceremony that was deserving of 
 his utmost effort the citizens of victoria which has been a garrison town for over seventy years anticipated the event 
 and rightly expected a first class show the colours presented by hm queen elizabeth ii 17 july 59 the queen 
 s visit provided an excellent opportunity to replace the colours which had been presented to the battalion in 1934 by 
 the then governor general earl bessborough twenty five years had elapsed since then and the battalion had participated in one 
 major war and korea 
 the patrician 18 winning many new battle honours the honour of receiving colours from her majesty was to be shared 
 with the king s own calgary regiment who were to receive a guidon this regiment which perpetuated the 50th battalion 
 of the first world war had on occasion fought alongside the patricia s in the italian campaign of 1944 they 
 sent a colour party to victoria to begin training with the ist battalion throughout the entire period a high degree 
 of co operation and respect existed between the officers and warrant officers of the king s own calgary regiment and 
 the patricias parade square training commenced in earnest during the second week of june the battalion was sized and made 
 up into six guards in the presentation office a start had already been made on the mammoth job of making 
 up the guest list it was decided that priority for seating would be given to serving and retired patricia s 
 of all ranks letters were dispatched to all branches of the patricia association informing them of the presentation and inviting 
 the members to attend over fifteen hundred invitations were sent out checking through the replies that were received one quickly 
 came to realize how sincere the old patricia s are in their loyalty to the regiment during the time the 
 invitations were being processed the battalion continued to drill four days a week the weather was generally sunny and warm 
 and as the drill improved all ranks became conditioned to the heat in the third week of practice the parade 
 was moved to the soccer field at beacon hill park where the actual presentation was to take place among the 
 difficulties encountered were the uneven ground on which the parade was to be held and particularly the great clouds of 
 choking dust that arose every time the battalion moved on or off the field by hard work the grounds committee 
 solved these problems and the training continued unhindered the royal canadian air force squadrons stationed at comox prepared 0:pre 0:pared 
 for a fly past over the parade in conjunction with the presentation 0:presenta 0:tion this manoeuvre required hours of practice 
 and co ordination by both services by the day of the dress rehearsal two days before the presentation the work 
 of the various committees was nearly complete traffic control was arranged the bleachers and seats were placed around three sides 
 of the field and last minute tickets were sent out most important after four weeks of arduous drill the battalion 
 had reached a high degree of precision the old and new colour parties had put in many extra hours and 
 now it could be seen that their efforts were well worthwhile at exactly ten minutes past ten o clock on 
 the 17th july 1959 the bugler sounded markers and the parade was fallen in by this time the seats which 
 surrounded the field on three sides and which had been filling up for over an hour were packed to capacity 
 the hillside to the east of the field was crowded with over ten thousand people many of the specia

 cd inspects the line of guards 17 jul 59 
 the patrician 20 tors who had come solely for the purpose of seeing her majesty now found themselves enthralled by 
 the opening ceremony which involved an abridged form of trooping of the colour this was the last occasion upon which 
 the old colours would be trooped shortly after the trooping was completed her majesty arrived and was greeted with a 
 royal salute accompanied by the commanding officer the queen inspected the line of guards in a land rover which the 
 battalion had outfitted for the occasion then the old colours were marched off to the tune of auld lang syne 
 this stirring moment must have recalled to every patricia on or off parade memories of his service in the regiment 
 during days of war and peace in the presence of her majesty and the duke of edinburgh the guards formed 
 a hollow square in the centre of which the drums were piled the new colours were then consecrated by the 
 protestant chaplain general and presented to the battalion by her majesty the queen in her address to the assembled parade 
 said the battle honours which are emblazoned on your new colour commemorate 0:commem 0:orate this service and ivill remind you 
 of the spirit of loyalty and devotion which you have marked your famous regiments they will keep before you the 
 memory and example of your gallant dead then the colour party joined the line of guards and a march past 
 in slow and quick time took place this was followed by the advance in review order and the royal salute 
 with the departure of her majesty and the marching off of the colours the parade was completed a report of 
 the presentation could well end at this point however if it did it would have failed to record the feeling 
 that will make it live on jlt col jc allan dso mbe cd reports to hm queen elizabeth ii 
 the patrician 21 in the memory of those who witnessed it an observer on the sidelines would have seen many 
 old patricia s standing to attention throughout the ceremony as if mesmerized by what they saw in the words of 
 a newspaper editorial writer the troops were magnificent for this writer the legacy of the queens visit will be the

 the patrician 23 laying up of old colours capt rj frost for the first battalion 1959 will be remembered as 
 the year her majesty the queen presented new colours to the battalion a less spectacular 0:spec 0:tacular but equally moving 
 ceremony took place on 25 november when the old colours were laid up in st paul s anglican church of 
 esquimalt these colours were presented to the regiment on 14 april 1934 by the earl of bessborough governor general of 
 canada at a parade in minto street armouries in winnipeg thousands of patricias served under the colours in the 25 
 years they were in service of these 14 officers and 293 other ranks gave their lives in action against the

 from 1920 when b company was stationed at work point barracks there are three plaques in the church commemorating the 
 service of patricias who died while serving in victoria in army circles the church is still known and fondly referred 
 to as the garrison church the battalion was fortunate to have a sunny day on the 25th as it had 
 been particularly wet the previous few days when the guards formed up on the square at work point it was 
 discernible that many on parade had served under the colours in sicily italy north west europe or korea the guard 
 commanders were maj wg milne and maj agw harbord harbord and the colour officers lt wj kitson for the queen

 rector the guard commanders 0:com 0:manders received the colours from the colour officers and handed them to the church wardens

 the patrician 26 first battalion report training national survival training the announcement by the minister of national defence during the 
 summer of 1959 that an additional role would be assumed by the army relative to national survival necessitated a re 
 orientation of our training program with more emphasis on civil defence subjects in order to be prepared as soon as 
 possible to carry out this new role efficiently a crash program based on the cadre system was devised this program 
 organized all qualified civil defence and first aid instructors into instructional teams which were responsible for the training of all 
 battalion personnel in addition instructors were obtained from the rcmp bc forestry service and bc civil defence organization to assist 
 us in these subjects that our instructors were unable to teach the training was carried out over a one week 
 period from 14 18 sept 59 all members of the unit not previously qualified underwent eight periods of instruction of 
 first aid two periods on forest fire control and 19 periods on light rescue and allied subjects the program was 
 designed as an introductory course on these subjects and to give all ranks a basic knowledge to allow them to 
 carry out their part in the mobile support column role during the past year the battalion has participated in three 
 national survival exercises work point barracks being located in the heart of the primary target area on vancouver island dictates 
 a three phase operation for the battalion of evacuation reorganization and re entry into the victoria target area the first 
 exercise known as co operation 111 was carried out on 24 apr 59 in conjunction with the national civil defence 
 organization this exercise tested efficiency in operational loading movement control and the ability to reorganize quickly beyond the target area 
 for rapid re entry the second exercise which was carried out under direction of hq bc area was known as 
 exercise tryonne 2 and was designed to assess operational and movement procedures and to determine the suitability of our organization 
 stores and equipment this operation involved the movement of the entire battalion group during the hours of darkness over 168 
 miles of treacherous logging roads and through some most inhospitable terrain the move was completed without accident or incident attesting 
 to the proficiency of our driving and traffic control organization one of the problems facing the battalion and one that 
 had been obvious on tryonne 2 was that of quickly assembling all personnel during an alert in the ensuing months 
 battalion and company plans were devised to 
 the patrician 27 effect a rapid assembly of all personnel a surprise training alert was flashed at 1950 hours on 
 19 nov 59 to test these assembly plans the battalion was able to assemble some 70 of all personnel and 
 the actual evacuation commenced at 2230 hours each exercise has contributed to our sop and increased the efficiency of the 
 battalion to concentrate and move quickly a number of problems are still to be overcome but all ranks have benefitted 
 from lessons learned on each exercise to such an extent that the battalion can now carry out its role in 
 national survival with efficiency and dispatch exercise lame duck during the spring period three company groups each with a troop 
 of 3 field squadron conducted assault crossing over the fraser river near chilliwack british columbia the aim of this training 
 later called exercise lame duck was to train our companies in the use of standard equipment for crossing over a 
 major water obstacle the training consisted of learning again how to use assault boats storm boats infantry bridging and of 
 course all the assault water crossing 0:cross 0:ing tactics and drills the week long training culminated in a night exercise 
 which saw each company group actually crossing the fraser river with a troop of engineers constructing a raft to transport 
 our vehicles during late july the entire battalion practiced the river crossing again near courtenay vancouver island exercise charpat one 
 this fall an exercise was organized with the royal canadian navy it was decided that each of the rifle companies 
 would send a recce party consisting of one officer one sergeant one corporal and five privates each of the recce 
 parties was to be carried on one of the ships of the second frigate escort squadron a coy was boarded 
 on hmcs sussexvale 0:sussex 0:vale b coy on hmcs antigonish c coy on hmcs jonquiere and d coy on hmcs 
 new glasgow in command of the patricia s was capt rm middleton exercise charpat one was divided into two phases 
 the first phase was purely naval lasting from 5 oct to 10 oct 59 during this phase the second escort 
 squadron was exercised as a squadron off the west coast of vancouver island in the second phase from 11 oct 
 to 16 oct 59 the squadron was divided and each ship went on patrol to the queen charlotte islands while 
 patrolling these practically uninhabited islands the recce patrols were landed to patrol given sections of the beaches the country through 
 which we passed is of great beauty but it is unbelievably rugged on its first patrol d coy s recce 
 patrol was landed on a small beach but it required two full hours of backbreaking work to move 500 feet

 was the great abundance of wild life all the patrols encountered deer bear eagles and streams choked with spawning salmon 
 while d coy even tangled with a live octopus miscellaneous training oct dec 59 from the first of october there 
 wasn t must left of any company in this battalion after the daily 0800 parade and inspection by 0830 all 
 but a very few of the men had reported on a series of internal courses or were in fighting order 
 for a day on the ranges for each of the internal courses and the rifle range work a cadre of 
 the best qualified officers and ncos was named one hundred and twentyone 0:twenty 0:one recently joined men undertook qualification for 
 leading infantryman on a nine week course thirty older soldiers were enrolled in an inf signaller 0:sig 0:naller gp 1 
 course 30 more on inf driver gp 1 training and a total of 96 24 to each of inf mortarman 
 pioneer machine gunner and anti tank gunner courses these plus officer study groups and nco refresher courses have made this 
 battalion a miniature rcs of i and too while all of the above was in full swing advantage was taken 
 of course vacancies offered at corps schools thirty four wos ncos and men attended courses at the rcs of i 
 including an important 15 on the small arms courses nbcw vacancies were also filled and with the graduates of these 
 courses as instructors a radiation monitoring course was held for 30 candidates for the first two weeks of december thus 
 every member of the battalion has been fully employed instructing 0:instruct 0:ing or attending a course but there was another 
 most important job to be done one in which every officer wo nco and man had to play his part 
 we wanted to win the a hamilton gault trophy and with all personnel split off from companies for training there 
 had to be some coordinating 0:co 0:ordinating agency to conduct the rifle qualification course lt col allan therefore appointed a 
 musketry cadre to handle range classification work with a first objective of qualifying the battalion to an average of first 
 class in the rifle this level of qualification was a tall order since under the condition of the award it 
 involved every man who wore ppcli flashes perseverance and careful coaching in each day s preliminary practices paid off and 
 only a very few men were finally accepted as failures 0:fail 0:ures overall it was a challenging and hectic training 
 period the battalion enters 1960 proud of our achievements in 1959 and only too aware that a further sustained effort 
 is essential for 1960 change of command of first battalion on thursday the 15th of january 1959 at work point

 4th of november guards of honour in a year in which 1 ppcli was presented with new colours by the 
 reigning sovereign guards of honour provided by the battalion during the 
 the patrician 33 year seem of less significance than normally however one ceremony in connection with the visit of her 
 majesty to victoria while not a guard of honour in the proper sense deserves mention the battalion was privileged 0:privi 
 0:leged to take part in a tri service escort parade for queen elizabeth when she arrived in victoria on the 
 16th of july after escorting her majesty to a ceremony at the legislative buildings the parade marched past the queen 
 this was the first time the colours presented in 1934 by the earl of bessborough were marched past the queen 
 and the last time they were paraded through the streets of victoria before being layed up three guards trained for 
 the presentation of colours led by the corps of drums and the rce band took part the 1 ppcli detachment 
 was commanded by major rh graham cd and the colours were carried by lieutenant rd bell and second lieutenant ta 
 bradley the privilege of providing two other guards of honour fell to the battalion during the leave month the first 
 guard was mounted for his excellency arthur gilson belgian minister of national defence on his arrival at patricia bay airport 
 on the 6th of august this was the first occasion that the colours presented to her majesty on the 17th 
 of july were paraded the last guard of honour in which the battalion took part was the tri service guard 
 mounted at the pacific national exhibition for the prime minister the right honourable john diefenbaker on the 22nd of august 
 a full guard sailed to and from vancouver in hmcs beacon hill to march in the annual pne parade and 
 one third of the guard joined the rcn and rcaf sections for the guard of honour lieutenant jrs ryley was 
 the officer of the patricia section and the rce band provided 0:pro 0:vided the music mess activities officers mess 1959 
 was rich in highlights and marked by change looking back one cannot help but be impressed by the essential character 
 of the year a visitor to the mess who had been there in january last would find few familiar faces 
 to greet him and would notice many changes in his physical surroundings as well first mention should be made of 
 the many officers who have departed 0:de 0:parted lieutenant colonel t de faye started the trend when in mid january 
 he handed over his command to lieutenant colonel jc allan then there began a process of attrition which saw no 
 fewer than 19 officers leave the battalion for other employment the details are recorded elsewhere 0:else 0:where and shall not 
 be recounted here leave taking is always a sad occasion it is particularly so when the officer departing has completed 
 his last tour with the colours of the regiment 0:regi 0:ment so it is with colonel tommy whose four years 
 with the battalion were eventful ones in which the spirit and elan which has always characterized 0:character 0:ized the regiment 
 were perpetuated in the finest tradition others left us for the last time there was captain michael carleton smith of 
 the green jackets whom we lost to 2nd battalion and whose 
 the patrician 34 absence is still keenly felt we also lost lieutenant murray wilson c pro c whose attachment ended 
 in july murray s hearty hand shake and lumpy cast will be hard to replace in september we said good 
 bye to captain don fraser the golfinest mo in the army don is now practicing 0:practic 0:ing sand shots in 
 egypt we also dined out two former commanding officers major general chris yokes retired with warm memories of an uncommonly 
 cordial dinner 0:din 0:ner feting him on the occasion of his final visit to the battalion brigadier cb ware left 
 for idc in november but prior to leaving was honoured at the traditional mess dinner it was a unique occasion 
 for the battalion officers since not only were they dining out a former co but also the new colonel of 
 the regiment and departing brigade commander as well fortunately the tide which swept away so many old faces brought back 
 to the regiment many old friends and new ones a diary of social events would take more space than has 
 been allowed and so only the highlights are mentioned below 17 mar 59 officers regain broom i 100 trophy after 
 a traditionally muddy battle strategy varied little from that employed in years past but tactics and terrain varied widely it 
 was our first year in a mud bowl seldom have so many laboured so shortly to such little avail in 
 the long history of the event the usual medications followed in the sergeants mess 18 apr 59 klondike night a 
 wild and woolly assemblage relived the gay and giddy days of the past and in addition to filling themselves with 
 beans bannock and bacon our guests gave much of their time and treasure in the pursuit of fortune 30 may 
 59 country style dancin lungs and limbs proved to be the only limitation 17 jul 59 presentation of the colours 
 reception this was undoubtedly the highlight of the year and saw the mess host 700 guests the reception was held 
 on the lawn in a magnificent garden setting overlooking 0:over 0:looking a calm sea lieutenant colonel and mrs allan received 
 from 1830 to 1930 hours among the guests were many old patricia s who had come to victoria to share 
 the occasion of the presentation with the battalion we were also fortunate in having a large group of guests from 
 calgary who made the journey to see her majesty present the guidon to the kings own calgary regiment at the 
 joint colour ceremony 27 jul 59 beach party songs and supper by the sea as usual the culinary excellence of 
 our staff proved to be a highlight of the evening suckling pig roast chicken corn and clam chowders were prepared 
 in the manner of our early ancestors the bar cunningly placed beyond a ditch was so well camouflaged that during 
 the latter stages of the evening many thirsty guests missed it completely and almost met their end in the sour 
 sea 
 the patrician 35 15 aug 59 living in officers roman party short title toga party an unquestionable success in every 
 sense rome was ne er like this or if it was so one can easily surmise when she fell before 
 the barbarian onslaught the wine was blood red and w i c k e d canfield and kitson have signed 
 affidavits to this effect 23 oct 59 reception honouring distinguished local guests the officers were at home to distinguished citizens 
 of the surrounding area 31 dec 59 the traditional new year s ball no snow but a nasty germ affected 
 some ladies prior to their arrival notwithstanding it was an excellent party and ended 1959 on a very high note 
 the diarist again apologizes for the brevity of the calendar suffice it to say that socially 1959 was one of 
 the most active on record and only an indication of the variety of the events which comprised the calendar has 
 been shown above sergeants mess the sergeants mess has settled down to garrison life in work point barracks this is 
 evident by the number of social functions throughout the year the regimental birthday dance was held in the mess with 
 the mess members giving their full support for decorating and planning the theme of the party was displayed by the 
 decorations and in the regimental coloured sashes worn by the ladies the annual broom i 100 game was played with 
 the officers at one of the local fields the officers won but not before lieutenant colonel allan was swamped in 
 front of the sergeants goal the officers retaliated 0:re 0:taliated by grabbing rsm austin who was dressed in serge and 
 giving him a mud bath all minor infractions were soon forgotten when one and all adjourned to the sergeants mess 
 the bth of may saw the mess again honouring frezenberg day and a social evening was held with sgt linklater 
 being the only member who appeared in formal attire he quickly made a hasty retreat home to change to civvies 
 in the month of may major general yokes paid a farewell visit to the mess where the members were gathered 
 together to wish him the best on his retirement oriental night was held on the 19th of june all the 
 furniture was removed and in its place rugs and cushions were laid down the members enjoyed looking at and endeavoring 
 to read japanese catalogues which were scattered throughout the mess the 17th of july was a full day for the 
 patricia s the presentation of the colours being the order of the day a reception was held on the sports 
 field for guests of the battalion and many members met old comrades 0:com 0:rades they had not seen in years 
 the evening ball was held in the gym

 the patrician 37 nasium where once again the cordiality of the mess was thrown open for everyone to enjoy the 
 leave month of august saw the annual sergeants mess picnic which was very successful the mess provided boats ponies merry 
 gorounds 0:merry 0:go 0:rounds bingo midway games and races for the children the messing staff prepared a barbecue which included 
 a 150 lb pig a quarter of beef and several salmon all the fore mentioned cooked in a barbecue pit 
 for most of the day a baby sitting department was set up complete with the necessary accoutrements bus service was 
 provided for families that did not have transportation the annual sergeants mess fishing derby held on the 26th of september 
 0:sep 0:tember was a great success although the weather played tricks in the afternoon some good catches were made in 
 the morning hours the notable social event for the month of october was the annual hallowe en dance at which 
 many fine and original costumes were seen during october the sporting highlight shifted from fishing to hunting 0:hunt 0:ing this 
 year more members than ever took the field despite the fact that on the island there is more walking climbing 
 crawling slipping falling getting soaking wet in short good training than there is actual shooting december saw a busy month 
 for the members the activities starting off with our annual turkey draw there were members who had as many as 
 32 tickets which shows the support that the members gave to make the draw a success a total of 176 
 prizes with 5 door prizes including 0:includ 0:ing a live 30 pound turkey won by mrs popowich were distributed the 
 mixed bowling league published the results of the first quarter scores with the following bowlers topping the ladder sergeant zwolak 
 202 rqms smith 197 wo 2 tutte 191 wo 2 green 187 mrs tutte 181 the 29th of december saw 
 the sergeants mess paying a visit to the officers mess many of the members were surprised and pleased to meet 
 captain carleton smith of the rifles paying a visit from edmonton the new year s eve ball was the gala 
 event of the year for the mess the messing staff did an excellent job of providing the dinner they also 
 set aside a table which consisted of fried sparrows fried silkworms chocolate coated baby bees octopus meat snake meat and 
 many other delicacies that warm the stomachs of the rich corporals mess april was a quiet month in the corporals 
 mess with little exciting happening other than a small spread of fried chicken and much conversation 0:conversa 0:tion one saturday 
 afternoon the sportsmen in our midst took advantage of the sunshine and participated in either a round of golf or 
 a spot of fishing 
 the patrician 38 may brought a gala dance at the club sirocco on the 9th in honour of frezenberg day 
 the dance was a great success and was talked about for weeks after ladies night was held on the 20th 
 of june the ladies turned out in full force each bringing her favorite spouse and in the case of our 
 single members their girl friends were there to receive them when they arrived it was a wonderful turnout and our 
 only regret was the lack of space july arrived too soon there were still a million things to be done 
 in preparation for the presentation of colours there was still much training to be done as everyone wanted to be 
 extra sharp for this possibly the most important parade of the average soldier s life the garden party was well 
 attended and well organized everyone ate their fill quenched their thirst and relaxed in general it was a gay and 
 wonderful crowd we had on that night of the 17th of july at the club sirocco and the mood was 
 that of a great celebration since we were celebrating the presentation of the colours at the end of july the 
 mess had a stag party at the sirocco club on the evening of 1 august which was a staggering success 
 captain carleton smith our supervising officer was presented with a going away gift of a gold plated glass bottomed mug 
 which was suitably inscribed to remind the receiver that his efforts on behalf of the mess were indeed greatly appreciated 
 september saw the members of the mess returning from lives of fishing and golfing the corporals mess became a corporals 
 mess again and gradually things got back to normal october was a quiet month as far as social activities were 
 concerned this was probably due to the intensity of training which kept most of our members rather busy at the 
 end of november a social evening was held at the gymnasium for corporal mackenzie jd and his bride of only 
 a few hours who were the honoured guests december brought the normal christmas festivities the children s christmas party in 
 which some of our members participated the christmas dinner in the men s mess which was as tasty as a 
 home cooked meal and then the preparations for the new year s eve ball which was shared with the privates 
 the ball was a wonderous sight to behold and certainly the perfect way of ending a good year in keeping

 movement penetration and defence in the forward zone all companies became accustomed to operating independently and valuable lessons in night 
 operations on the nuclear 
 the patrician 42 battlefield were learned these lessons subsequently proved beneficial in the final brigade exercise there were several other 
 highlights before the completion of phase 1 regrouping of the battalion was necessary when four officers and 110 other ranks

 by 0200 hours in phase 2 the setting was similar except that a much deeper penetration was made with troops 
 mounted on tanks and apcs patrolling was again excellent and the information gained resulted in the destruction of three enemy 
 companies by nuclear strikes in the first 15 minutes of the attack enabling three companies to reach their objectives in 
 phase 3 the battle was extremely fluid as companies dashed here and there avoiding mobile enemy counter attack forces and 
 striving to reach their objectives by mid morning two company groups were fighting on their objectives but for exercises purposes 
 0:pur 0:poses were rendered ineffective by nuclear strikes considering the distances 0:dis 0:tances involved the strain placed on vehicles and 
 communications and the enemy numerical superiority the battalion was commended by brigadier c b ware the brigade commander for an

 with one problem taking the recruit that comes in dressed in civilian clothes and a desire to become a soldier 
 and transforming him into a soldier fit to take his place in one of the battalions this to be done 
 in a given period of time the reward for this period of time comes to both the instructor and the 
 recruit when they are paraded for their final parade in the depot and passed on to the battalion this moment 
 wipes from the slate many frustrations experienced by both the instructor and the recruit during the hectic period of recruit 
 training at this time both the instructor and the recruit realize that the extra bit of drive applied by the 
 instructor and the extra bit of effort applied by the recruit have made this transformation from a civilian to a 
 soldier become a reality on 17 jul 59 the chief instructor major whj stutt cd was posted to hq alberta

 the patrician 54 ppcli band heartiest greetings to all patricia s on this our first opportunity to appear in the 
 patrician since the band s arrival at the home station the singular fact that this homecoming bridges a separation of 
 four years from the regimental depot is worthy of note we wish to express sincere thanks for the warm welcome 
 extended to us and our gratification in being able to renew the cordial relationship of former days it was with 
 feelings somewhat mixed that we bade farewell to the canadian brigade in germany thus bringing to a close a remarkably 
 active tour of duty that had included as part of the itinerary a flying visit to the unef base on 
 the gaza strip two years in a foreign country can only be considered in the light of a temporary form 
 of existence and the final weeks preceding rotation found us pleasantly anticipating our return to home soil 3rd green jackets

 in background setting out from soest weighed down with bundles and packages we presented more the spectacle of pioneer settlers 
 than a commonplace evacuation at rotterdam settling within the comforting bulk of the rms saxonia we prepared for a relaxing 
 sea cruise whilst taking a last look at the european continent our stay in which had left us with memories 
 fond or otherwise according to each individual s hopes and aspirations whilst abroad crossing the atlantic by ship is more 
 a state of mind than an appreciable movement daily the vast expanse of ocean meets the eye giving the impression 
 that no distance has been covered merely time 
 the patrician is passing drifting snow heralded our approach to the shores of canada the sight of the wintry landscape 
 bordering each side of the ship during the passage through the gulf set us diligently searching our bags for some 
 warm clothing a day later and we were caught up in the hustle and bustle of disembarkation at quebec and 
 a hectic time ensued collecting 0:col 0:lecting baggage rounding up the children and retrieving the cars from customs sheds several 
 days and gallons of gas later rolling through heavy slush of a recent snowfall we had arrived edmonton at last 
 the long trip was over breaking the ice musically the band s first public appearance was in lyrical accompaniment to 
 the inter company boxing tournament the following morning found us sombrely engaged at the funeral of the late lieutenant governor 
 and dare we mention it a performance at the childrens christmas party in the afternoon for contrast a sincere welcome 
 and cordial greetings to our newcomers sergeants whiteley and salamandick and corporals taylor and telman congratulations 0:congratu 0:lations to sergeants 
 george punter and lan drake on their being awarded the canadian decoration sergeant punter having already the long service medal

 edmonton regiment in italy and northwest europe and until 1952 in the militia when pressure of business intervened with our 
 various cadet corps we have had a very successful year at vermilion we have been virtually swamped with eager boys 
 at edmonton the response has also been good but with great reluctance we terminated the cadet drum and bugle band 
 at edmonton the cadets at grande prairie are gathering strength and are an asset to the community 0:com 0:munity the 
 regimental band has continued to render colorful and musical service to both the edmonton community and the battalion and under

 creek lt h ketcham young soldier training throughout the year the regiment in edmonton continued to train on tuesdays and 
 saturdays the training on saturdays has been largely concentrated on young soldiers these young men of high school age have 
 joined the regiment in large numbers and after undergoing the usual recruit training undertake national survival training a civil defence 
 role which includes first aid traffic control rescue radiation 0:radia 0:tion monitoring and is slanted at enabling the young soldiers 
 to gain the classification trained militiaman during the school summer vacation for a period of six weeks the regiment again 
 accepted the responsibility for training a group of 120 high school lads the first four weeks were spent training at 
 the prince of wales armouries in edmonton and the last two were spent at camp wainwright where they were given 
 the opportunity to show what they had learned the enthusiasm of this group of young soldiers cannot be over emphasized 
 and their appearance deportment and military precision was excellent when they were inspected by the goc western command major general 
 geoffrey walsh cbe dso cd on their return to edmonton 0:edmon 0:ton from camp one of the regiment s most 
 gratifying experiences in many years was the acceptance at royal roads of four of our young soldiers k r sieverston 
 r r f burns r d gillespie and r c g laird reports from these officer cadets indicate that their 
 earlier training is standing them in good stead national survival training the national survival exercise shakedown i held over the 
 ist may weekend and during a snowstorm was basically a militia group scheme with the two mobile support columns based 
 on edmonton participating the loyal edmonton regiment formed the nucleus of one mobile support column and it was commanded by 
 lt col gj armstrong the problem was that a bomb had been dropped some 100 miles away and that there 
 was extensive damage and many casualties and it was our job to get there rescue and treat the casualties and 
 restore communications 0:communica 0:tions with the area 
 the patrician 58 the exercise certainly did what it was intended to do namely to show up the weaknesses in 
 our training and equipment so that future training would overcome these shortcomings all troops were exercised and many valuable lessons 
 were learned including how to cope with inclement weather the retiring goc western command major general christopher yokes cb cbe 
 dso cd inspected the group for what was to be his last time on the sunday after the exercise was 
 completed the regiment was sorry to see the general go the drive for new recruits this fall was only moderately 
 successful in comparison with other years but we have a goodly number of troops in training b company is the 
 recruit training company and they are concentrating on the elementary soldiering skills the f n rifle map reading and map 
 using fieldcraft drill and first aid support company and c company are practicing the skills they have already learned and 
 in these two companies the training accent is on national survival training on tuesday nights the hq company is looking 
 after the housekeeping of the battalion and is ready to embark on a programme of wireless training and air photo 
 interpretation it is well known that this battalion has good representation in dawson creek bc and in grande prairie vermilion 
 and vegreville in alberta and the training in these centers is running parallel to that undertaken in edmonton recent inspection 
 tours show that distance from battalion headquarters does not necessarily dampen enthusiasm on the contrary the vigor and skill of 
 the members of the regiment in these somewhat distant areas is most commendable at the commencement of the fall training 
 programme it was decided that the regiment would train all the new recruits who could parade on saturdays and for 
 this purpose b company was detailed when these recruits complete their elementary training next may they will return to their 
 parent units for specialist training it is gratifying that a large number of these young soldiers will of their own 
 choice remain with the loyal edmonton regiment the training of these young high school students has been made the easier 
 because of the number of both senior and junior ncos that have qualified within the regiment over the past two 
 years perhaps watching these young intelligent non corns passing on what they have learned to their school mates gives the 
 real purpose of this highly successful activity the battalion is singularly grateful to the home station princess patricia s canadian 
 light infantry for all the help and encouragement that has been extended again throughout this year the priceless privilege of 
 being able to use their excellent facilities at the hamilton gault barracks 0:bar 0:racks has made everybody s job so 
 much easier and has encouraged the troops to master the many arts of soldiering the instructional cadre at edmonton has 
 also earned our deep gratitude 0:grati 0:tude for the help they have given particularly to those companies up north and 
 to the east of edmonton

 who graciously accepted a series of photographs of the regimental museum by captain gardner who also sent a photograph of 
 a memorial plaque location unknown this plaque is located on one of the pillars in the rma chapel sandhurst it 
 was presented by lady patricia ramsay between 1920 and 1930 a letter arrived from major mainprize telling me that the 
 frezenberg tree was reported to be in bad condition proceeding towards ypres down the menin road past the bird cage 
 and near the culvert one turns right along a trick which leads to the old battalion headquarters the leaves on 
 the tree are turning black on the edges but otherwise it looks healthy saw brigadier agnew in scotland and the 
 tree will be looked after in the grange tunnel i found the ppcli and 42nd carving but not the 49th

 the patrician 67 united nations 9 military observer in palestine major rj kerfoot cd major r j kerjoot cd returned 
 to our first battalion in victoria in october 1959 after having spent a year in the middle east most of 
 that time was spent with the united nations truce supervision organization for palestine untso the following article is a brief 
 outline of life in untso as he saw it plus a few general remarks on the middle east any proposal 
 of solutions to the many complex middle east problems are left to the experts who know it and possibly to 
 the many who having spent a jew weeks in the middle east feel they are qualified to write on the 
 subject it has only been possible to give the barest outline of untso its functions and its difficulties the important 
 related matters such as the arab refugee problem have not been considered for palestine as it was under the british 
 mandate and as the area is today please refer to the accompanying map the british relinquished their league of nations 
 mandate on 14 may 48 after both they and the united nations had found it impossible to reach a peaceful 
 solution acceptable to the arabs and the jews as soon as the british left the country fighting between the jews 
 and arabs which was already widespread developed in to a full scale war between the jews who had by now 
 formed the state of israel and the arabs composed 0:com 0:posed of the arab inhabitants of palestine and the annies 
 of the neighboring 0:neighbor 0:ing arab countries the israelis were united and reasonably well prepared while the arabs were not 
 as a consequence the arabs got the worst of it and only retained control of the gaza strip and that 
 portion of what is now the hashemite kingdom of jordan lying west of the river jordan under the auspices of 
 the united nations mediators during the period february to july 1949 a series of armistice agreements were signed by israel 
 and the arab countries on her border these agreements put an end to the fighting but are not peace treaties 
 and did not settle any of the fundamental problems the united nations truce supervision organization for palestine was formed to 
 help maintain peace in the area and assist in the implementation of the various armistice agreements 0:agree 0:ments an outline 
 of untso 1959 organization is included on an adjoining page in untso some of our varied duties consisted of manning 
 outposts investigating complaints of truce violations vehicle patrols manning a headquarters wireless set supervising the handover of property or persons 
 and the one most likely to deflate a pompous observer delivering the daily newspaper to the israeli police garrison in 
 the mount scopus enclave the outposts are situated on both sides of the israeli syrian border a wooden or tin 
 hut provides shelter for the two observers on duty from these points observers keep watch on sensitive border areas and 
 report any activity to higher headquarters by wireless while i was there i only witnessed two shooting incidents neither of 
 which resulted in any casualties when shooting starts it is reported to the chairman of the mac mixed armistice commission 
 who contacts both sides through their governments armed forces and liaison officers arrange for a cease 
 the patrician area in which u n t s o operates the area of palestine underthe british m amd ate

 the patrician 69 fire at a set hour untso operating procedure discourages action by the romantic type of observer who 
 at first imagines himself stopping a local war by rushing in between the participants with a white flag a dead 
 observer possesses good propaganda value to the side that can convince 0:con 0:vince the world that the other fellow did 
 it investigating complaints of truce violations was a duty common to all mac s these investigations could be extremely trivial 
 or they could involve the investigation of a theft killing or a small scale battle production of a report was 
 not aided by the fact that frequently both sides were trying to prove a point rather than by helping find 
 the truth of the matter witnesses for the most part had to give their evidence through an interpreter and frequently 
 0:fre 0:quently snowed evidence of having been coached naturally enough statements given in evidence by nationals of one side wei 
 e diametrically opposite to those given by the other side patrolling was done in all mac s but hjkimac did 
 by far the most white un jeep station wagons equipped with motorola wireless sets were used for the patrols which 
 were generally in jordan in the vicinity of the israeli border the terms of reference for these patrols were extremely 
 0:ex 0:tremely vague the only hazard i encountered was the danger that one might be overwhelmed with hospitality along the 
 route and founder on the large amounts of mint flavoured tea and arabic coffee pressed on one by the jordanian 
 villagers unheated accommodation during the winter rains the summer heat and the various stomach ailments were unpleasant but i found 
 my worst enemy was sheer boredom occasionally i was very busy but in common with the rest of the observers 
 i frequently found myself with a tremendous 0:tremen 0:dous amount of spare time on my hands to counter this don 
 mcquarrie and i occupied ourselves by reading biblical and other local history visiting 0:visit 0:ing historical sites photography and cooking 
 to illustrate only a few of the possibilities one can visit the remains of a dozen crusader castles and the 
 ruins of the ancient cities of palmyra jerasli and petra one of the op s is located near the site 
 of biblical dan while another is located on the sea of galilee now lake tiberias in sight of the place 
 where christ preached the sermon on the mount and even nearer to the place where he performed the miracle of 
 the loaves and the fishes photography yielded excellent results but one had to be careful where one took pictures as 
 some moslems do not like being photographed for religious 0:reli 0:gious reasons and a state of war exists in the 
 area some of the officials seemed to regard a camera as being nearly as dangerous as an atom bomb on 
 the op s on the syrian israeli border the observers had to cook thenown 0:then 0:own meals i like good 
 food so i amused myself by trying to prepare the best possible meal when it was my turn to cook 
 all the foregoing was not a complete answer to boredom but it helped tremendously i visited the gaza strip several 
 times and saw several friends with the united nations emergency force unef quite a number of people do not seem 
 to know the difference between the two organizations so i will give a very brief explanation unef is an armed 
 force of all 
 the patrician 70 ranks of roughly brigade group size but without heavy battalion weapons tanks or artillery units from this 
 force man the demarkation line between the gaza strip and israel and the egyptian border and israel their main jqb 
 is to prevent infiltration and raids by force when necessary they live in tented camps in the desert and except 
 for a few short leaves have very little freedom of movement the military component of untso consists 0:con 0:sists of 
 approximately 100 unarmed officers who help supervise the various armistice agreements when i left jerusalem at the beginning of october 
 1959 the relations 0:rela 0:tions between israel and the arab countries were far from cordial but there had been relatively 
 few incidents of violence in the border areas for the preceding six months the last time tanks artillery and heavy 
 weapons had been used was in early december 1958 it is most probable that small border incidents such as shootings 
 and illegal crossing of the frontier will continue to occur from time to time as they are often caused by 
 actions of individuals rather than being directly attributable to national policy as far as the future is concerned it is 
 quite possible that a major clash could occur as all the old issues still remain unresolved some of the issues 
 that could lead to such action are the use of force by the israelis in an attempt to obtain passage 
 through the suez canal for their ships a turn in arab politics where heightened tension with israel is desirable unilateral 
 diversion of the jordans waters by israel the middle east is so unpredictable that the unexpected may happen and the 
 area may even stay quiet for some time in my year in the middle east i consider the only way 
 i increased my military knowledge was by becoming familiar with the geography of the area despite this i found my 
 tour interesting mainly i think because 0:be 0:cause i occupied myself as constructively as possible i do not think there 
 is any solution to the arab israeli problem in sight at present it is probably therefore that untso will continue 
 to function for a long time and that many more patricia s will continue to serve in it the cleaner

 the patrician 72 unmogip major owen browne major owen browne was a company commander with 2ppcli prior to his posting 
 to unmogip he should he returning to canada in may this year if you have a chair handy major browne 
 you had better sit down i have some rather startling news for you you ve been posted to unmogip so 
 said my co when he called me on the telephone at camp wainwright from edmonton that was a long time 
 ago in april 1959 sir i protested i know brown is a comman name but perhaps you have me confused 
 with some other fellow named brown i can t be posted i ve only been back with the unit a 
 short time anyway what the blazes is unmogip it sounds like a rude belch if there was little sense in 
 what i was saying it was because i was trying to keep the surprise out of my voice well owen 
 replied the co unmogip is united nations military observer group in india and pakistan though it s not really in 
 india or pakistan it s in kashmir as you probably know part of kashmir is now occupied by india and 
 pakistan west pakistan that is not east pakistan 0:paki 0:stan which is over by burma since the co sounded as 
 though he knew what he was talking about i decided to let well enough alone before he confused me further 
 by dragging 0:drag 0:ging in east and west germany yes sir that s perfectly clear i remember now i replied 
 while trying to get those wheels in my brain grinding back to the days when i had been studying current 
 affairs the co came to my rescue if i remember correctly he said when the british pulled out of india 
 a war started between india and pakistan to decide who was going to get the state of kashmir just when 
 the thing was going nicely i interrupted the united nations sprang to attention stopped everything created a cease fire line 
 and gave birth to a new baby called unmogip that was about six years ago wasn t it my voice 
 rang with confidence no it was eleven years ago oh the confidence in my voice faded my wife received the 
 news of my posting in the manner all wives receive unexpected news of their husband s postings we can t 
 be posted she said my daffodils are just starting to come up and anyway 0:any 0:way where is this place 
 uhnmoojyp is it near vancouver i told you i wanted to go to vancouver next during the following weeks i 
 did a lot of research and technical reading in order to have a proper background for my new job i 
 diligently 
 the patrician 73 poured over books such as lives of the bengal lancers and bugles and a tiger i even 
 reread one or two of mickey spillane s old texts but alas could find nothing about unmogip in them then 
 my papers started arriving from army headquarters and some of my misunderstandings 0:misunder 0:standings were immediately removed to be replaced 
 by confusion i had not been able to understand why our chief clerk had worn such a supercilious grin when 
 handing me the papers from ahq until i read them they listed a number of pre requisites officers selected for 
 posting to unmogip must be able to speak read and write english boy i thought they must really be dragging 
 the bottom of the barrel for this one must be able to walk up to eight hours a day and 
 climb to elevations of approximately 16 000 feet i began to feel uneasy about my waistline must be able to 
 subsist on a diet consisting mainly of curry goat s milk and dahl that one didn t worry me i 
 had survived years of mutton stew during the second world war but what the devil could this dahl stuff be 
 must have an even temperment and be able to work with nationals from other countries that was alright too unless 
 they meant it to apply to poker as well i have no friends in a poker game and so it 
 went for this i had slaved to pass staff college eventually after needles for yellow fever plague typhoid tetanus cholera 
 polio and something else thrown in for good luck and with my family tucked away i took off for the 
 other side of the globe a few days and a few air hostesses later i found myself in srinagar kashmir 
 my first impression of unmogip was that the prerequisite to know the english language thoroughly was not so silly after 
 all the staff here is drawn from about twenty countries and all business is conducted in english it is not 
 uncommon to hear something like oi tot de speakink vas in inglis to be yet vot is dis lanvage ahstrylylin 
 dat is inglis no at the time of writing the permanent head of unmogip is an australian lieutenant general with 
 a staff consisting of an administrative 0:adminis 0:trative and operations component both headed by canadians the military observers who form 
 the operations component are all army officers drawn from australia canada chile belgium denmark new zealand norway sweden and uruguay 
 the administrative component consists of internationally recruited civil servants who have chosen work with the un as a full time 
 career they are here with unmogip from belgium canada cuba denmark eire england greece haiti holland italy japan lebanon mexico 
 norway sweden thailand and united arab republic you would be surprised to hear how many different ways dammitall can be 
 said in english 
 the patrician 74 a second impression of unmogip was that the prerequisite demanding 0:de 0:manding physical fitness was not exaggerated 
 in so far as the military observers are concerned a large part of the area in which the military observers 
 work is in the pir panjal range of the greater himalayan mountains nearby mt nanga parbat at 26 600 feet 
 is the third highest mountain in the world and the highest yet unclimbed while none of the locations we have 
 to visit are in the area of the glacial ice it is not uncommon 0:un 0:common to work above the 
 permanent snow line my highest climb to date was to 14 500 feet and while the going was not hard 
 in the sense of cliff scaling or the expected mountain climbing hazards the air is so rarified that it is 
 difficult to get a proper lung full of air and progress is extremely slow the karachi agreement of 1950 specifies 
 that neither the indian or pakistan armies will increase their potential beyond what it was at the time of the 
 cease fire agreement a large part of the work of the military observers therefore is to periodically visit the various 
 defended localities and inspect the defences in relation to this aspect of the agreement with most of the defended localities 
 being situated on ridge lines mountain climbing becomes a matter of day to day routine my first climb to 12 
 200 feet was supposed to be a relatively easy one and was part of the familiarization program given to new 
 comers break you in easy is the theory but the only relation between theory and practise comes in the words 
 break you the party for this first climb consisted of a swedish major who was the old timer breaking me 
 in two indian army officers and an armed escort of four feeling very spry and half my age i started 
 off like a mountain goat determined to show all the party that canadian soldiers can do anything anyone else can 
 do if not better that attitude lasted for the first thirty minutes climbing by then i was huffing and puffing 
 like a steam engine almost out of water my clothes were wringing wet shapeless and heavy from perspiration another thirty 
 minutes passed and someone very kindly without saying a word placed a climbing stick into my hands to help with 
 balance and bracing another thirty minutes and i hid behind a boulder and removed my trouser weights and threw them 
 away finally i stopped measuring the climb in minutes and started measuring it in yards 7s yards up to that 
 rock and rest 25 yards to that stump and rest then i stopped measuring the climb at all i merely 
 placed one foot ahead of the other until just when i was finding it impossible to keep my lolling tongue 
 inside my mouth i looked up and saw we had arrived a big neatly dressed sikh sergeant was standing there 
 looking at me with the faintest suggestion of a smile on his face i thought laugh at me will you 
 you devil so i heaved a great sigh threw out as much of my chest as i could and staggered 
 up to him like a recruit left right leftright 0:left 0:right and threw up my hand to return his salute 
 unfortunately in flicking 0:flick 0:ing up my hand i sprayed his face with perspiration but neither of us changed expressions 
 i had made it and though the name of the 
 the patrician 75 patricias stands untarnished as a result it was a long time before my eyes came back into 
 proper focus by way of contrast to the mountains a small number of military observer groups are stationed in the 
 flat ground of the plains in the extreme west of the jammu kashmir province the problem of staying healthy in 
 this area is not how to avoid getting shin splints but how to avoid getting sunstroke snake bites scorpion and 
 land crab bites athlete s 0:ath 0:lete 0:s foot and trench foot from fungus and rot during the monsoons and 
 scrub typhus from the mites which live in the long grass in many parts of the plains another impression concerning 
 unmogip was that the prerequisite concerning the ability to handle an unusual diet is also quite logical ulcerous or finnicky 
 stomachs have no place here most of the military observers live at an indian or pakistan brigade or battalion hq 
 automatically 0:auto 0:matically therefore their diet becomes your diet i have learned to eat raw onions regularly to dine on 
 green peppers and red chilis instead of lettuce for a salad and to eat curry powder in meats to the 
 extent that 1 am not sure whether my skin has darkened because of the sun outside or the curry inside 
 me however having finally become accustomed to breathing out fire for two hours after every meal i now find the 
 food palatable and in fact quite enjoyable of course this might be due to the fact that my taste buds 
 have been burned away i have even learned to like dahl since i mentioned that word earlier i suppose i 
 should now tell you that dahl is a vegetable mixture of corn barley curry spices and a vegetable resembling navy 
 beans from which dahl gets its name these ingredients are cooked together and served as a thick kind of vegetable 
 stew the receipes of no two cooks are the same for dahl but then the recipes of army cooks are 
 rarely the same for anything anywhere in the world my fourth impression about unmogip was about the business of temperment 
 and accepting the customs of nationals from other countries but how is one supposed to react when told in all 
 seriousness by an uruguayan that it is a basically sloppy custom to use a saucer with a tea cup after 
 being assured that saucers are not used in uraguay how does one answer the comment that you must be a 
 sloppy people to have to use a saucer as a drip pan under your chin every time you drink a 
 cup of tea furthermore what would you say if a danish officer who had commanded the house guard of the 
 king of denmark tried to tell you how to troop the color and you a patricia how would you break 
 up an argument about women between a fellow who has four wives and lets them move around openly in public 
 and a fellow who has only one wife and keeps her hidden in purdah behind 0:be 0:hind a curtain like 
 veil 
 the patrician 76 if you found that the rats in your building were eating the buttons off your shirt what 
 method would you adopt to dispose of these rats i obtained a cage type rat trap and had been catching 
 about three or four rats a day after some time i checked with the orderly to see how he was 
 disposing of the captured rats which i had been turning over to him imagine my surprise when i saw him 
 take a cage to the back of the building and turn the rats loose he simply could not kill those 
 rats because his hindu religion forbade it as he might be killing a personal ancestor of course one s own 
 religion does not seem strange to himself but in such circumstances what do you do to get rid of the 
 rats and how long do you suppose it takes to learn to eat your food with the right hand only 
 no tools now without looking like a baby with a bowl of pablum only the right hand mind you because 
 long ago kashmiri 0:kash 0:miri custom decreed that a man uses only the right hand when indulging in any manly 
 manipulations the way one eats his food demonstrates whether or not he has really learned the significance of the deepening 
 of a male voice east is east and west is west but here the twain have met we the peoples 
 of the united nations determined to save succeeding 0:succeed 0:ing generations from the scourge of war have resolved to combine 
 our efforts to accomplish these aims preamble to the un charter from such has come this organization called unmogip a 
 heterogeneous group of internationals who are trying to speak english without forgetting their mother tongue who are trying to stay 
 physically 0:phy 0:sically fit in a region of high mountains and tropical plains while living on strange and unusual foods 
 who are enjoying some of the most spectacular scenery in the world while trying at the same time to analyze 
 its military significance in detail who are trying to adhere to their own religious and social conventions while intermingling with 
 others who are adhering to such different religious and social practises that the whole is a study in contrast such 
 is unmogip such are the impressions of this military observer from canada s ppcli who is fortunate enough to be 
 here and to my dear wife no my dear unmogip is not near vancouver compliments of pioneer fruit and vegetable

 the patrician 77 the crossing of the moro and the capture of v roatti this article appeared in canadian army 
 training manual number 42 dated september 1944 t was written by lt col cb ware co ppcli at the time 
 this action took place brigadier ware dso is presently at the imperial defence college in the united kingdom on the 
 4th of december 1943 the ppcli were concentrated on the high ground overlooking the moro river the battalion was on 
 the left side of the brigade sector with the bth indian division on the left in frisa during the night 
 4th sth december reconnaissance patrols were sent out to cover engineer reconnaissance of the bridge at grid reference 317086 to 
 find suitable fords for tanks and to gain information of the enemy in the roatti area one squadron from 44th 
 royal tank regiment joined the ppcli in this area on the morning of the sth december and a warning order 
 to prepare for crossing the moro river in the roatti area that night was given by the commander of the 
 2nd canadian infantry brigade very little was known of enemy intentions or dispositions on the far side of the moro 
 it was thought that roatti was probably a lightly held outpost with stronger disposition in the caldari and jubatti area 
 daylight 0:day 0:light reconnaissance patrols were consequently immediately sent out to pinpoint enemy dispositions around roatti and to check fords 
 and routes for infantry these patrols succeeded in pinpointing five machine gun posts on the perimeter of the nearside of 
 the village they confirmed that the 
 the patrician 78 steep slopes on this side did not offer any good routes up but that the right flank 
 appeared to be more suitable during the afternoon of the sth december the co of ppcli was ordered 0:or 0:dered 
 to cross the moro on the night of sth 6th december capture roatti reorganize there until joined by the 44th 
 royal tank regiment in support at first light then exploit as quickly as possible to caldari and cut the orsogna

 completed the co of ppcli issued orders to his sub unit and supporting arms commanders 0:com 0:manders in daylight from 
 grid reference 328094 which overlooked the moro and roatti after dark the co of the 44th royal tank regiment sent 
 tank officers with ppcli reconnaissance patrols to look for tank crossings these were found to be extremely difficult but no 
 thought of failure was entertained a reconnaissance patrol from 12 platoon b company 0:com 0:pany under lieutenant j l mcculloch 
 was sent out at last light with orders to penetrate to the village and gain last minute information on enemy 
 dispositions affecting the route in this patrol did excellent work and brought back important information regarding enemy activity in that 
 end of the village plan and method the enemy was judged to be holding the village by a perimeter defence 
 with a garrison in the town itself the plan was to make a silent crossing with no preliminary artillery or 
 machine gun support this crossing to be made on a one company front at the best ford at grid reference 
 324096 companies were to cross on a timed basis with the leading company coming in from the right flank breaking 
 the perimeter and the remainder passing through the gap thus created enemy dispositions did not point to the river being 
 covered by machine gun fire and as it was not anti cipated that the crossing itself would be hindered by 
 small arms fire the leading company was to press right in and so gain the maximum surprise the forming of 
 a bridgehead to secure the crossing for supply routes was to be left to the last company to cross guides 
 to company forming up places were supplied by b company the tanks were to come down the road to the 
 blown bridge at grid reference 317087 ford the river and move along it to the right of the village and 
 thence up a steep and twisting mule trail arriving as soon as possible after first light the battalion order of 
 crossing was as under b company 24oo hours zero hour a company oo2o hours 2400 hours c company ooso hours 
 d company on order company tasks were b company to force the main perimeter and capture the main village south 
 west part grid reference 319098 a company to capture the north east part of the village grid reference 321098 this 
 part is separated from the main village by a wide draw 
 the patrician 79 c company to concentrate in the area of grid reference 321097 on the outskirts of the village 
 and when the village was clear to pass through b company to occupy the area of grid reference 315095 d 
 company to form the bridgehead to secure the crossing and routes for the supply mule trains and tanks artillery forward 
 observation officers from 3rd canadian field regiment 0:regi 0:ment were allotted one to b company one an observation post on 
 the near side of the moro and the co s representative travelling with the battalion commander all no 22 wireless 
 sets were mule packed intercommunication by wireless was normal with the co s no 78 wireless set control and no 
 18 wireless set link to rear battalion hq at grid reference 335095 rear battalion was on line to brigade hq

 communication with all squadrons of his regiment 0:regi 0:ment the battalion hq no 22 set moved by mule with the 
 battalion commander zero hour was 2400 hours course of the battle all companies reached their forming up places in good 
 time and without 0:with 0:out incident although the going was very steep and it was hard to keep silent considerable 
 difficulty was encountered getting mules down the steep bank and they were finally forced to come down in separate parties 
 b company crossed the river at 2400 hours the fording was very silent and there were no incidents they moved 
 down to the right and the leading platoon passed a track junction which led on the left to the main 
 part of the town and on the right to the north east part before fire was opened fire from enemy 
 machine guns was opened up from the left and above this platoon this fire was not very effective and the 
 platoon was getting into position to deal with this when further cross fire was opened up from the right with 
 some grenades there was a rather confusing fire fight during which time bren guns and 2 inch mortars firing low 
 angle were effectively used the company commander made his plan to knock out these posts and assaulted from the left 
 flank two posts were knocked out by grenade and rushing and occupants taken prisoner enemy fire had broken out in 
 several places around the perimeter but was largely inef fective progress was slow but b company finally forced its way 
 into the outskirts of town and then to the town square positions were taken up and as fire appeared to 
 be coming from all directions mopping up was carried out by patrols in sectors of the village as divided by 
 the company commander several prisoners were taken and mopping up took until 0700 hours these prisoners were in a majority 
 of cases quite surprised to see the strength in the town and many of them had been asleep until the 
 company entered 
 the patrician 80 breakfast was ready in some of the houses a company in the meantime crossed according to plan 
 and were still in the valley when machine gun fire opened up from above them scouts were in close contact 
 with b company and a company took up a position in rear of b company until they had broken through 
 a company then pushed through to the outskirts of the town and swung off to their objective on the right 
 their first contact with the enemy was a motorcyclist coming down the road from the b company objective shouting achtung 
 he was effectively dealt with 8 platoon on the left investigated a house which was showing a light it had 
 been occupied and was apparently the german hq as there was a sign 5 company 0:com 0:pany hq regt 90 
 pz div the occupants fled in the direction of 7 platoon and although some escaped five or six were taken 
 prisoner one with his hands up threw a grenade and was promptly shot in the foot mopping up immediately commenced 
 and more prisoners were taken from the houses and caves in the vicinity c company crossed according to plan and 
 with battalion hq were concentrated on the outskirts of the town about 0600 hours waiting for b company to finish 
 mopping up d company was in position as bridgehead 0:bridge 0:head and mules were starting to come up the night 
 had been very dark and confusing with considerable firing on both sides and first light was very welcome to enable 
 the company positions to be reorganized and to complete the mopping up there was considerable sniping still going on and 
 the battalion scouts and snipers had some good shooting in dealing with this considerable ammunition had been used up by 
 all companies in the night s fighting soon after first light there was a prolonged mortar barrage including nebelwerfers and 
 shelling on the whole town and it was soon apparent that a counter attack was developing against a company from 
 in front and to their left 10 platoon of b company was occupying a position in and about a house 
 which enfiladed an enemy forming up place and got in some deadly execution the enemy took good advantage of the 
 cover provided in the olive groves and the remainder of b company was unable to assist except by sniping 7 
 platoon of a company was the left forward platoon of a company and stood its ground until one section ran 
 completely out of ammunition lieutenant r carey mc ordered this section back and when another section was out of ammunition 
 he was subsequently taken prisoner with five other ranks from 7 platoon his defence enabled the remainder of the company 
 to be successfully redisposed company hq was meantime under heavy machine gun fire and major w de n watson mc 
 commanding a company coolly reorganized his company 8 platoon covered the move of company hq into a new position and 
 then covered by fire from 9 platoon 8 platoon worked itself into 
 the patrician 81 better positions 9 platoon was in an excellent position and did good execution on the attacking force 
 from that time on the enemy were unable 0:un 0:able to advance or change their disposition the ammunition supply was 
 tense but some was rushed up from c company and d company and the situation was well in hand c 
 company was concentrated ready to deliver an immediate counter attack if the situation should warrant it the tanks in support 
 could be seen from first light slowly making their way along the river the mule track was most narrow and 
 tortuous and progress was difficult and slow by a fine effort five tanks finally got up to the battalion position 
 the leading one with the squadron commander 0:com 0:mander on foot arrived about 0930 hours and was in action soon 
 after arrival enemy positions were pointed out to the troop commander and he swung his leading tank into action the 
 sound of the 75mm and the unlimited machine gun ammunition was very cheering soon five tanks were in action and 
 in a short time all position had been pointed out and there were no live germans in roatti the germans 
 did not lack courage and one machine gun post opened fire on the leading tank and kept firing until the 
 machine gun crew were killed the infantry tank co operation could not have been higher the arrival of the tanks 
 coincided with the arrival of the first ammunition mule train and the enemy were completely driven off by 1000 hours 
 the enemy had every intention of coming to stay and were loaded with blankets food and a recent german efi 
 issue several more were captured hiding in caves two hiding below battalion 0:bat 0:talion hq were captured by the signals 
 officer prisoners were from a different company regiment 90 pg division both artillery sets had been knocked out by shell 
 fire and all shooting was done through the rear battalion hq link until fresh sets were brought up the commander 
 of 2nd canadian infantry brigade ordered ppcli to reorganize and consolidate on the position the mule trail had become impossible 
 and no more tanks could get up the position was reorganized and digging completed a and b companies consolidated in 
 roughly the same position with b company having 11 platoon in a vineyard on the south end of the town 
 12 platoon in the area of the houses and in front of the south west corner of the town and 
 10 platoon in the morning position scouts and snipers were positioned in the town and c company was located centrally 
 for counter attacks to either flank one platoon of d company was placed under command of a company and the 
 remainder dealt with sniping occurring against mule trains mule trains had arrived with much ammunition of all types the tanks 
 were placed in hull down positions to deal with any tank threat from the caldari direction which was deemed the 
 only suitable tank approach reconnaissance and standing patrols were sent out to give early warning of other counter attack all 
 defences were tied in and the battalion was perfectly set for the next counter attack the second counter attack was 
 infantry cum tanks from the left flank along the axis of road junction grid reference 309091 to roatti 
 the patrician 82 a j 1 big orange c j 
 the patrician 83 first warning was given by a standing patrol of b company at the houses grid reference 313094 
 the attacking force consisted of seven mk iv special tanks and roughly a company or more of infantry fire was 
 opened from these tanks from the houses grid reference 313094 one tank was knocked out by battalion anti tank guns 
 across the moro valley the houses on the edge of town were subjected to machine gun high explosive and armoured 
 piercing fire the attacking force split into two groups immediately after opening fire three tanks followed by infantry immediately swung 
 off the road to the left through the olive groves making for the 10 platoon position the remaining tanks swung 
 to the right making for 11 and 12 platoon positions artillery fire was brought down but the attack came on 
 one tank on the right was knocked out by shermans and the three making for 10 platoon positions were all 
 knocked out although one got into the middle of 12 platoon positions the tank attack was then thoroughly broken and 
 no more was heard from them a company hq was heavily shelled by high explosive and armored piercing shells a 
 heavy smoke concentration appeared on a company s right flank and a thrust from that direction was expected but did 
 not materialize the infantry accompanying the tanks deployed when close to the town and attempted to infiltrate in they were 
 met with such heavy and accurate fire from bren guns and rifles that they were forced back a number of 
 times the tanks were having excellent machine gun shoots each time the enemy fell back they reorganized in the cover 
 of the olive groves and came on again one group succeeded in getting into some houses on the edge of 
 town but were trapped there and after two or three were killed waved a white flag and gave themselves up 
 a company were getting in longer range fire on the enemy left flank on our left flank 11 platoon in 
 spite of a grave danger of being outflanked held off all enemy and succeeded in killing many a piat fired 
 at a tank at 75 yards range was unsuccessful as the bombs failed to explode after the fifth attempt to 
 get into the town had failed the enemy withdrew leaving behind many dead some prisoners and five knocked out tanks 
 one sherman was knocked out a german demolition party later blew up one of their knocked out tanks the battalion 
 was again reorganized d company bolstered up the left flank and night positions were taken up patrols were sent out 
 and discovered that the road junction at grid reference 309091 was held caldari area was very active and there was 
 considerable digging activity in the area of jubatti and this ridge artillery was used extensively with good effect and screams 
 and much yelling followed several shoots about 2200 hours reconnaissance parties arrived up from the loyal edmonton regiment who were 
 pushing through ppcli to take caldari in the morning this was later cancelled and further orders were to be received 
 in the morning with the exception of shelling mortaring some machine 
 the patrician 84 gunning from the jubatti ridge and one threat which caused a complete stand to the night passed 
 without incident casualties in the battalion over the whole action were eight killed nine missing believed prisoners of war and 
 sixty wounded there were 17 and 11 stretcher cases on the first and second days respectively and 32 walking wounded 
 casualties occurring as a result of the heavy mortar and shell fire throughout the day were nested in company areas 
 until they could be brought to the regimental aid post in a quiet interval here they received necessary first aid 
 and were retained until dusk when mortar and shell fire had diminished evacuation was effected by stretcher parties of 60 
 and 45 men on the respective days composed mainly of a echelon personnel their route was entirely overland for almost 
 two miles in most difficult conditions down the muddy slopes of the valley and along the river course to the 
 bridge at grid reference 317087 where they were met by battalion and field ambulance transport which took them to the 
 sth canadian field ambulance medical dressing station in san vito the walking wounded made their own way back to the 
 rear regimental aid post at rear battalion hq thence in ambulances to the medical dressing station between 45 and 50 
 prisoners were taken during the action those in the original assault were all from 5 company regiment 90 panzer division 
 and by the time the second counter attack was over prisoners had been taken from all companies of the regiment 
 a mass of german equipment was captured including machine guns rifles pistols wireless sets telephones three mortorcycles clothing blankets food 
 and cigarettes six 81mm mortars were captured intact and one anti tank gun which was dragged up the hill during 
 the first counter attack these mortars and anti tank guns were later manned by trained personnel in the rifle companies

 the patrician 85 customs of the service lt d i ross frequently during the course of our daily service routine 
 we become completely immersed in our work and do not take the time to consider why certain things are done 
 as they are and how this came about this article outlines the history of a number of practises and customs 
 of our army commencing with the origin of the custom of wearing sashes the original purpose of the sash was 
 quite practical it was used for carrying a wounded officer off the field the sash was usually made of silk 
 as this material is strong light and full enough to enclose the human form as far back as the seventeenth 
 century the sash was worn either around the waist or over a shoulder falling to the opposite side gradually the 
 wearing of sashes developed into a sign of rank during the seventeenth century the material used for sashes was similar 
 to that still in use but considerable variation prevailed in regard to the fringes commissioned officers generally wore fringes of 
 gold or silver but some preferred silver or gold network while other favored plain crimson silk by degrees however great 
 uniformity came about until the use of gold and silver network became confined to the higher officers as is the 
 case today in 1747 a clothing regulation directed that infantry officers should wear the sash over the right shoulder and 
 cavalry officers over the left shoulder and that ncos of both arms should wear it around the waist in 1768 
 a royal warrant for clothing gave more precise details in regard to color material and method for wearing the sash 
 this warrant declared that officers of cavalry and infantry the sashes will be crimon silk and worn around the waist 
 sergeants of dragoon guards dragoons and light dragoons a sash round the waist of crimson spun silk with a stripe 
 of the facings of the regiment sergeants of infantry the sash to be crimson worsted with a stripe of the 
 color of the facing of the regiment and worn around the waist multicolored sashes such as those described above were 
 finally abolished because when they get wet the colors ran into each other by 1912 all officers wore their sashes 
 around the waist knotted on the left side whilst warrant officers and sergeants wore theirs over the right shoulder falling 
 to the left side the wearing of red sashes was discontined 0:discon 0:tined during world war ii but was reintroduced 
 in 1947 the familiar red tabs worn on the collars of the coats of general officers brigadiers and colonels also 
 have a long history reaching back at least to the fifteenth century the official name for these red tabs is 
 gorget patches and originally the gorget was a piece of armour which 
 the patrician 86 protected the throat or gorge after protective armor was no longer used the gorget as one of 
 the distinguishing marks of an officer s uniform remained until well into the nineteenth century it was directed that the 
 king s arms would be engraved on the gorgets along with the number of the regiment they were made of 
 gilt or silver according to the color of the buttons on the uniform and were usually hung around the neck 
 from ribbons and rested upon the upper part of the breast during the war in south africa 1899 1902 a 
 type of khaki uniform was introduced and in order to distinguish general officers red patches of material worn on the 
 collar were introduced these symbolical gorget patches remain in use today the custom of linking regiments and corps of different 
 countries together in a formal alliance is peculiar to the military forces of the british commonwealth not only are british 
 regiments and corps allied to those of dominions and colonies but regiments and corps of different dominions are also linked 
 together by an extension of the custom credit for initiating the idea of regimental alliances goes to the late general 
 the earl of donald when general officer commanding the canadian militia in 1903 he felt that a feeling of comradeship 
 already present could be further developed between canadian militia regiments and british regiments he reasoned that the militia regiments would 
 stand to gain some advantages such as qualified instructors from the regiments with which they were affiliated he also hoped 
 that british regulars who had left the army might by this system find friends to help them when they sought 
 their fortunes overseas lord dundonald put the idea to field marshal earl roberts then commander in chief of the british 
 army and the latter fully endorsed the idea the first regiments to affiliate were the gordon highlanders and the 48th 
 highlanders of toronto the title sister regiments was first proposed but the word sister did not find favor and the 
 word allied was substituted the alliance between the gordon highlanders and the 48th highlanders was duly recorded in the army 
 list for july 1904 each year since then new alliances have been approved between regiments having some common association some 
 of the common associations between regiments are quite obvious such as regiments with similar titles or dominion regiments with numbers 
 identical to those borne by british infantry regiments up to 1881 the alliance of the coldstream guards to the governor 
 general s foot guards of canada is based on the fact that the uniform of both regiments is almost identical 
 both the king s own rifle corps and the rifle brigade are allied to several rifle regiments of the dominions 
 all large corps such as the royal artillery royal engineers royal army service corps are allied to their opposite numbers 
 in the dominions in december 1924 multiple alliance were allowed thus removing the restriction of only one regiment or corps 
 of each dominion being permitted to be allied to one british regiment or corps in 1931 regiments 
 the patrician 87 of the dominions were permitted to become allied to each other under this arrangement for instance the 
 west yorkshire regiment the royal montreal regiment of canada the 14th bn australian infantry and the waikato regiment of new 
 zealand all became allied to each other due to the recent reorganization of the armies of great britain and the 
 dominions some regiments have been disbanded or amalgamated or reorganized out of all recognition of their former selves and this 
 has resulted in the termination of some alliances the practise of saluting with the hand has brought forth a number 
 of theories to account for its origin the most likely seems to be that the raising of the open hand 
 was a demonstration of mutual trust and respect exercised by nobility in the days of chivalry in token of these 
 sentiments knights when meeting one another placed themselves in an attitude of defencelessness by uncovering their head or raising their 
 vizors but headdresses have not always been easy to remove quickly and so the preliminary movement of raising the hand 
 to the head became accepted as the earnest intention of the completing the whole movement during the seventeenth century saluting 
 in both the french and british armies was by removal of the headdress at some time during the first part 
 of the eighteenth century however the coldstream guards departed from this practise for a regimental order of 1745 read the 
 men are ordered not to pull off their hats when they pass an officer or speak to one but only 
 to clap their hands to their hats and bow as they pass by this may have started a practise or 
 confirmed an existing one which spread to other regiments for many years saluting was performed with the hand farthest from 
 the officer saluted this involved saluting with the left hand when passing an officer on the right hand side to 
 some indian troops saluting with the left hand was an insult and this method was abolished in 1918 the idea 
 of defencelessness is also seen in the former practise of firing gun salutes with live shot in days past when 
 it took some time to reload a gun after it had been fired a ship going into a foreign port 
 could not suddenly assume an offensive attitude when its guns had recently been fired firing the guns was therefore evidence 
 that they were empty in the present arms the rifle is placed in a position where it can do no 
 harm to the person saluted until recently the salute with the sword was reminiscent of crusader days when the knight 
 kissed the hilt before entering conflict the hilt represented the cross and the motions of the salute roughly described a 
 cross in the present salute some of the motions have been omitted to trace the origin of carrying colors one 
 must go back to the days of early man who fixed his family badge to a pole and held it 
 aloft in battle as a rallying point should the occasion arise medeival chivalry followed the same idea when they placed 
 their armorial bearings on their 
 the patrician 88 banners so that they would float on high well above the battle at the beginning of the 
 seventeenth century when armies were beginning to adopt a system of regimentation each company was allotted a color a system 
 which persisted for about a hundred years in 1751 regiments were allowed only two colors king s and regimental and 
 this arrangement 0:arrange 0:ment has remained until the present day as the purpose of colors was to advertise the presence 
 of commanders those regiments whose duty it was to skirmish ahead of the main body where speed and concealment were 
 essential to the execution of their duty did not carry colors these were rifle regiments which is the reason they 
 still do not carry colors in the cavalry the counterpart of rifles is lancers and hussars who do not carry 
 standards or guidons for the same reason colors are regarded as the symbol of the spirit of the regiment for 
 on them are borne the battle honors and badges granted to the regiment in commemoration of its valiant deeds this 
 association of colors and heroic deeds has caused them to be regarded with an attitude of veneration 0:venera 0:tion to 
 a large extent they portray the history of the regiment the full history is contained in written records but as 
 these are not portable in a convenient form the colors emblazoned with distinctions for long and honorable service are something 
 in the nature of silken history there are a good many terms in everyday use which are traceable to the 
 army mufti signifying civilian clothes as opposed to uniform must certainly date from the crusades as it is an arabic 
 or saracen term for ordinary dress as distinguished from that worn on a ceremonial or official occasion the word barrack 
 or park probably also originated from the crusades one word being a corruption of the other for this is an 
 arabic term for the formation of camels when collected for the night as guns are parked or soldiers collected in 
 barracks to drink a bumper bumper was the name for a leather jack or flagon which was called the bombard 
 an early form of cannon made of leather reinforced with iron hoops the term lock stock and barrel indicating completeness 
 arises from the fact that the different parts of the musket were accounted for separately on different pages of the 
 equipment ledger much has been written about customs of the service and undoubtedly much still remains to be written to 
 even begin treating the subject adequately would require the writing of a small volume the interested reader is referred to 
 an excellent publication by major tj edwards entitled military customs published by gale and polden ltd in great britain a 
 study of service customs while interesting for its own sake will also foster a strong sense of continuity with the 
 past which can be a great benefit to the soldier of any era confidential comments once a year commanding officers 
 throughout the services submit a confidential report on officers under their command to assist them 
 the patrician 89 in making up these reports we have included some comments that have been extracted from confidential files 
 this officer has talents but has kept them well hidden combs his hair to one side and appears rustic does 
 not drink but is a good mixer can express a sentence in two paragraphs any time a quiet reticent neat 
 appearing officer industrious tenacious diffident careful and neat i do not wish to have this officer under my command at 
 any time he has failed despite the opportunity to do so his leadership is outstanding except for his lack of 
 ability to get along with his subordinates he has failed to demonstrate any example of outstanding weakness he hasn t 
 any mental traits a tall stocky officer needs careful watching since he borders on the brilliant his departure is in 
 no way considered a loss in fact it is a gain this transfer was concurred in by all commanders with 
 a sense of relief a particularly fine appearance when astride of horse believes sincerely in the power of prayer and 
 it is astonishing to note how many times his prayers are answered open to suggestions but never follows same continually 
 fails to meet the low standard he has set for himself never makes the same mistake twice but it seems 
 to me that he has made them all once very often this officer is sober in any change of policy 
 or procedure he can be relied upon to produce the improbably hypothetical situation in which the new policy will not 
 work gives the appearance of being fat due to the tight clothes he wears is stable under pressure and is 
 not influenced by superiors is keenly analytical his highly developed mentality could best be used in the research and development 
 field he lacks common sense has developed into a good round staff officer tends to over estimate himself and under 
 estimate his problems being surprised and confused by the resulting situations this officer s physical condition is good broken leg 
 this officer is trying very trying an independent thinker with a mediocre mentality maintains good relations unilaterally an exceptionally well 
 qualified officer with a broad base tends to create the impression of unpositive personality through needless and undiscerning gentility and 
 soft spokeness of average intelligence except for lack of judgment on one occasion in attempting to capture a rattlesnake for 
 which he was hospitalized this officer should be posted to another english speaking unit and so raise the standard of 
 both
