 axe by edward j hart between the years 1925 and 1948 a fascinating legend was current in the canadian rockies
 a legend which purported that upon the summit of towering mount alberta at the northern extremity of the columbia icefield
 reposed a silver ice axe which had originally come from the hand of ernp ror hirohito of japan the legend
 was given a good deal of collie a noted british chemist and alpincredence certainly by the numerous climb ist who

 which were inspired by the legend were made i to complete the second ascent of mount alberta but they were

 didn t have enough support services but these were completely made to make it worthwhile as a passenger scrvquate for
 public use the calgary car co ice ltd had a short life due to the necessity then private citizens took
 the initiative of having horses to pull its two buses out and tried to start a street railway system of

 1 920 s the automobile was popularity the street railway was suddenly growing in popularity on calgary streets hit with
 a huge reduction of services dur and with it the traffic problems also grew ing the first world war with
 men enlist soon because of the popularity of the car ing left and right employees of the railway the people
 used the streetcars as a scapegoat had to be cut down from 280 to 200 and blaming them for the
 traffic problem 1917 saw the introduction of streetcars run in a letter to the superintendent of the by one man
 acting as both driver and con street railway in 1928 several suggestions ductor profits were slim and services limit were
 made about why the traffic problems ed until the end of the war in 1918 existed and why the streetcars
 should not once again the railway grew two new be blamed for them first of all it was lines were
 added the first major routes stated that the streetcars were the best this is the first street car used on
 the south calgary line in 1911 it was photographed at the corner of 26 th ave and 14 th st

 use which paid luckily the streetcar was the first on the over half for the paving of roads their lines
 route that monday morning in 1919 for were on and therefore should have prefer later on in the day the
 car would have had ence over their use another point was several more passengers also fortunate made that the streetcars
 had to follow was the fact that the store was closed and routes and schedules and could not be fault
 the space provided for waiting streetcar pasad for any tie ups entailed sengers was enipty sonic of the reasons listed
 for the traffic in the next few days several suggestions problenis were automobiles stopping on were discussed for the prevention
 of any streetcar lines no tail lights on cars and similar future accidents the citizens of children driving cars calgary
 wanted strict laws made and en during its 41 years of use the street rail forced preventing the tanipering of
 interway s niain problem was the winter on section switches which happened regularly cold days frost ice and snow covered
 the without punishment the other redluest was tracks several niinor accidents such as to change the south calgary route to
 allow streetcars coming off their rails turning on it to continue down 14 th street eliminating their sides or airbrakes
 failing on steep the necessity of turning at the foot of the hills were the results but ice also caused
 hill this was eventually carried out but two of the worst accidents in the history did not completely stop any
 occurrence of similar accidents of the street railway the first of these is the famous accident it was in 1948
 when the second accident where streetcar no 68 on the south cal occured at the intersection once again icy gary
 route smashed into the front of crook s rails were the culprit as the south calgary drug store the car
