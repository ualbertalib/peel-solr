 the eventually tried and convicted on the mounted police lived up to their surface it seems like a minor incident
 promises whiskey traders were arrested but the implications went much deeper and jailed and law breakers whether than anyone realized
 at the time indian or white were given fair treatment the police created such a bond of the blackfoot had
 been among the first trust with the blackfoot that when a to welcome the north west mounted police in 1874
 american whiskey treaty was presented to them in 1877 traders had been wreaking terrible havoc they signed the document even
 though among the tribes and the chiefs had been they did not understand it the fact that powerless to stop
 them when the police colonel maclend was one of the treaty drove the renegades away the redcoats commissioners was sufficient
 for the were treated as heroes they also gained indians to acquiesce as crowfoot stated respect when they promised that
 indians when accepting the terms of the treaty 2 and whites would be treated equally if the police had not
 come to the under the law country where would we all be now colonel james f macleod the senior bad
 men and whiskey were killing us officer in the area explained that the so fast that very few indeed ofus

 the north west mounted police farm instructors clerks and other posi they were the law officers magistrates tions were created
 to serve indians who jailers customs officers diplomats and would soon be reservation bound friends and because of the wisdom
 henceforth the police would be simply and character of colonel macleod the enforcers of the law indians were treated with
 compassion and understanding the fact that there the problem for the blacl oot at least were less than two hundred
 mounted was that the indian department policemen in an area controlled by more appointments were so wrapped up in than
 two thousand armed independent patronage that many of the senior and self sufficient blacksoot warriors was positions went to men
 who had few perhaps another encouragement to treat proven qualifications for the task within a short time the clerk for
 the tribes with respect southern alberta was arrested for fraud but whatever the reasons the relation while others in the
 west prostituted their shi p between the blackfoot and the authority to the debauchery of young mounted police was one
 of mutual trust indian women 3 one of the men on the accordingly when sitting bull asked the blackfoor to
 join him in a war against the above lef t whites the blackfoot refused when afew weeks before the bull

 scene with ii i ‘ reinforcements of a further twenty men 5 ‘ 1 whcn he aruved at blackfoot crossing
 he learned that the indians were quiet but he made no immediate attempt to contact crowfoot or the other chiefs
 ‘ instead he instructed inspector dickens to fortif y the detachment in anticipation of a possible enemy attack sacks of
 oats and flour were piled against the walls of the building as a fortification and the blackfoot wonder whether there
 according to crozier crowfoot fully loopholes were cut in the log walls was indeed one law which applied equally agreed

 fortunes of the doing bodily harm could be shown harsh of the damage already was beyond re blackfoot seemed to

 i had encountered back to the bible hour others talked were quite other worldly and apolitical about aberhart s elusive
 dividends and his funny money needless to say this left me very puzzled i was intrigued and desired to find
 out more about my own religious faith because my exposure to christianity had been limited to fundamentalism it was natural
 for me to select berean bible college an institution which my family supported as a place to further my postsecondary
 education during the three years at berean my questions were onl y intensified in my sociology course i read s
 d clark s article on reli giotis sectarianism and politics in canada clark s description of aberhart s movement did
 not strike me as correct when he claimed that aberhart had attacked the mainline churches because they were wealthy and
 alberta history spring 1992 m another thing happened at berean bible political activity was a direct out growth college the
 theology that i was being of his reli gious fundamentalism an mactaught was aberhartite theology and curate assessment in reading
 w e mann s from my exposure to historical theology sect cult and church in alberta i also i realized
 that what i was being taught found glaring inaccuracies because mann in my classes was rather unique amid depicted the
 prairie bible institute at divergent from mainstream christian three hills as an example of a typical thinking the excessive belief
 in the fundamentalist institution that supported king james version of the bible and the aberhart and social credit i knew
 that concept of an ongoing apostolic tradition such comparisons between aberhart s separate from the roman catholic and calgary prophetic
 bible institute and the anglican traditions puzzled me and the school at three hills were qtute wrong more i investigated
 it seemed that those for i had primary source documents beliefs had been introduced by aberhart which showed that prairie

 amid broadening my own theology before several factors brought me to that edmonton majoring in near eastern studies conclusion during
 the summer of 1976 sunday aug 1936 i worked with the chaplain s office at mcmaster i met dr george

 aberhart thesis and recom delusions and found them preoccumended that i turn it into a book i was pied with
 the devil those beliefs a so encourage to continue wor ing oh so dominated them that they behaved aberhart s
 early political aberhart by a hebrew professor gerald in ways which were the reverse of what harrop who was very
 interested in they would have normally considered pamphlets called for a radical politics so i turned my attention right and
 proper again to aberhart and switched to the complete overthrow of the history department ‘ 1 he second factor which
 influenced my investigation was a graduate seminar in with the encouragement of dr harrop existing economic order the history department
 at mcmaster and dr richard allen the specialist ui which had as one its topics sixteenththe social gospel i published
 my first here he was quite different century aemonoiogy anti witcflcratt article which addressed the antitheses in some bells started
 to ring as i noticed aberhart s thinking amid behaviour how the inquisitors became so caught up from major douglas
 the aberhart s compartmentalized mind in their hunting of witches that their his humanitarian concerns and his own behaviour became
 far worse than founder of social credit own ambitions for power could possi the supposed crimes performed by the bly
 explain the contradictory aspects witches i began thinking about aberhart of his behaviour and his own theology which was during
 the course of my research in the preoccupied with the negative aspects of papers of the late professor john a
 eschatology the devil the antichrist irving which are housed at the the great tribulation etc i had found university of
 toronto i discovered an in aberhart s own pamphlets that he outline of a biography of aberhart it believed in
 the power of witchcraft and appeared to contain many of the same praised the medieval pope who had sent conclusions
 that i had concerning the inquisitors after it aberhart accepted aberhart eventually i tracked it down as true the ideas
 from the malleus to its author iris miller who had malificarum the medieval text on collected many primary source docu

 was quite different from major t douglas the founder of social credit v in trying to place aberhart on the

 c a totalitarian state which controlled c it all aspects of economic life i addiessed i this issue in a
 paper i delivered to the o 0 ps western canada studies conference in c ‘ 1979 this revisionist position which

 food requirements for 30 days and buying on a pack horse and build a pack that what we thought would
 be our mini editor s note at the time of this would stay put i also learned something mum requirements

 be glad to get jobs whereas we wanted to be free to roam in the limited time available to us

 as far as we could and climbed moose as his opinion that these were sonic of mountain from which vantage
 point the progeny of a band of horses brought we had a good view of the area at the in
 south and east of where we were by a ¼ junction of canyon creek and the elbow man named olson
 at any rate we got a i river where the fire had been located thrill out of seeing them the
 whole area was entirely free from smoke and we could see no evidence of comimig out of the canyon we
 found what has been aptly called desolation fire what to do was our problem would flat and it is worthy
 of comment this is time ranger permit us to go up the river a barren summit area at the head
 of the he mig ht even take some action against 4 us for running our on mcrae elbow the vegetation
 is sparse trees are scrubby and gnarled the river follows a we were still determined to go to tortuous course
 through this rocky wind kananaskis lakes so we decided that we swept land and i was always tempted to would
 break camp very early the next follow the river on foot if possible and morning hoping that by pushing our
 see everywhere it goes ten years later in at this late date i will not attempt to outfit we would
 get to the ramiger s 1929 when my wife myrle and i were justify what we did we got lost
 left the station before anyone was stirring this crossing the flat with our pack outfit on wagon road worked our
 way down to we did found no sign of life at the our way home from the lakes we decided
 the river through the timber and forded ranger s and we were on our way to the to do a
 little exploring every rime i the river we quietly made our way into hi g h country the fire was
 out and the had passed this way in previous years i the ranger s pasture where we eventually fire fig
 hters had departed fancied i heard the roar of a waterfall but located and caught our pack horses never took
 time to properly investigate unseen we packed up amid headed back from canyon creek on all went well in fact
 i was inclined to put it down to for the upper end of bragg creek beyond the elbow falls where
 we had the roar of the wind through some cavernfished before the country was new to us never before or
 since have i felt so much fishing was good and we loafed along like openings in the mountain peak nearby
 we had time that day july 30 like a horse thief or outlaw of some kind exploring as we went
 for example 1929 for we had camped early not too far as we sneaked around in the dark trying following
 up a creek we later found was away the previous afternoon on pocaterra to find and catch our pack horses
 and called ford creek on foot we found a creek the early camp was brought then making our get away
 we made waterfall with a deep pool at its base to about by a sudden and blindimig blizcamp by a
 little creek back in the hills this point the creek was teeming with zard morning found a foot of snow
 on well into time nig ht hours we cooked fish mostly bull trout or dolly vardens the ground and we
 broke camp early some grub and had our first meal since but beyond the falls there were no fish walking
 and leading our horses most of breakfast the previous morning at the just a muskeg creek the pool at the
 base the way to the elbow summit to keep livingston ranch at bragg creek our of the falls was literally
 full of 10 to 12 warm on the summit we found ice on peace of mind was not made any
 better by inch trout and we quietly watched them the streams from the glacier to the lake the red glow
 we could see in the south continually try ing to make their way u the snow was lig hter here
 and as we western sky that nig ht and i admit we the fall this of course was impossible continued
 on we soon ran out of it the had serious misgivings about what we and most of the fish we
 caught in that sun was out and it was warming up and had done so ended the first day of
 our pool were badly bruised we sat down on the sunny side of a big long anticipated pack trip rock
 to absorb some of the sun s heat morning found us on the trail again over beyond ford creek was
 the forks of the to bragg creek and up the creek to a little elbow we chose the left fork
 and soon it was then i again heard what i thought meadow not far from the entrance to we found
 ourselves in a beautiful canyon was the roar of a waterfall and so we staked the canyon leading up to
 the foot of moose with a somewhat precarious rock trail out our horses and decided to investigate mountain here we
 made a comfortable which we were obliged to follow just to our delig ht we found not one but two
 camp there was a good fishing hole before entering the canyon we came magnificent waterfalls actually not too far near
 our tent and plen ty of good grass upon upwind from us a band of wild away but well hidden

 seen from the trail at that point twinges of conscience we were reason crashing through the down timber it and
 it was a surprise to me how close it ably content towards the end of the was a beautiful sight
 and we marvelled at was i took p ictures of each with my old week it rained very hard and

 that old cabin that ten years following this trail we came to the upper beyond desolation flat was elbow lake
 later myrle and i found a still living pine lake which was at aim elevation subat the foot of elbow
 glacier and here we tree beautifully carved to represent a life stamitially hig her than the lower lake we found

 found it to be almost a approached time lake we were faced with amid packer working out of banff was
 the series of waterfalls so much so that while making an important decision here we sculptor sometime after we saw
 amid the lower lake was teeming with fish found a trail crossing our trail at right photographed it someone cut
 down there were no fish in the upper lake angles which was the trail to the lakes the tree and
 took it away it has beemi this section of time kananaskis river no we had three choices to the left
 to the said that it has been preserved as a work longer exists for calgary power has taken right or

 been sacri elbow lake and the foot of time glacier ficed for power development when i we found that we
 were actually at the we made this our home base and cx first saw that upper lake i thought it
 summit of the elbow pass the route we p lored the area we found a trail leading was the most
 beautiful lake i had ever had chosen found its way down into a into the upper end of the lake
 where the seen there were a number of wooded deep heavy timbered valley amid some kananaskis river entered we could
 see islands in it amid in the background there where in that valley must he time elusive where time trail
 seemed to leave the water was a tremendous mountain range and a kananaskis lakes down we went in on the
 other side amid decided to try to g lacier from which there was a very large the valley we found
 a creek which we cross over we eased our saddle horses and hig h waterfall visible to the naked later
 learned was pocaterra creek nanmed down into the water first thing we knew eye many miles away sonic of its
 natural afrer george pocaterra who had prospected we were in swimming water but that was and filed on coal claims
 in that area only for a short distance and we got across 0 osite pa e sonic years before the
 trail pretty well without any trouble we had put a light followed the creek for a while as does pack
 on my pack horse old dick and as view of the mountains at the headwaters of pocaterra creek storm creek
 pass is indicated e ananaskis coleman road today usua l he was following us and not being by an arrow
 from a height of land we soon saw a led he stood on the bank watching us lake to which
 the trail branched off and cross and finally slithered down the bank below soon we were at our destination later
 into the water but instead of following when the author saw upper kananaskis lake we found that the trail which
 crossed our route he headed out into the lake in 1919 he said ithought it was the most ours near
 elbow lake went from the and to our amazement he followed a bar beautiful lake ihad ever seen north fork
 of the elbow to the headwaters of sheep creek so we would have been a long time finding the lakes
 had we followed either one there was a banif national park warden s cabin at the lake but it was
 unoccupied at that time this area was part of the park on the cabin door we found a hand printed
 note reading gone to mud lake back on tuesday charlie 1 beneath this someone had written charlie died in 1916
 apparently the sign had been on the door for three years indicating perhaps that there were not too many people
 travelling in that area at that time otherwise it would not have rem named undisturbed for so long alberta history
 spring 1992 all good things come to and end harvest him we became very good friends over ‘ s time
 was not far away and i had to return the years and i valued that friendship to work and dan
 to school it was not highly with ted and his wife mary without some misgivings for we had to he
 was an excellemit horseman and judge check out at the ranger s station on of horse flesh and when one
 rode up to elbow river and we were sure we would ‘ his door or met him on the trail
 after his at least get properly bawled out ted met initial greeting you could see him us with a smile
 obviously he was carefully sizing up the horse you were relieved that we had turned up he said from the
 time you gave mcrae the riding if he approved he said so otherwise no comment he was a student of
 slip we had no idea where you were nature he loved the territory which was turning to dan he said
 i phoned your his private kingdom he was happy in beauty has been destroyed by the power dad and told
 him you two were fight his work and he was a happy man he development but in spite of this
 it is still ing fire and i dmdn t know for a day or did however have some very strong
 one of the outstanding beauty spots of two that you weren t with mcrae we ‘ ideas on some subjects
 and when in our canadian rockies dmdn t know where you were and were 1935 the social credit landslide swept
 worried he quietly and carefully cx we were disappointed that there were no the province of alberta ted decided plamned
 to us how we had failed to act as fish in the upper lake and decided to do that he
 couldn t work for a government we should have and we could only agree something about it in the shallow
 water ‘ with such far out policies and he with him we left quite subdued and not near where we
 forded the lake there were signed he returned to a small ranch on at all proud of ourselves thousands of
 minnows and fingerling trout sheep creek just across the creek from we caught a lot of these and carried them
 i had met ted before on my trips with okotoks on the left hand side of the up to the
 upper lake we never knew if george livingston and knew something old no 2 highway where he lived and they
 survived if they didn t it wasn t for of his background he was born in raised good horses until
 he died lack of food for it was almost impossible india and had a good education i mmever to fill
 a pail with water from the upper knew how he happened to come to lake without getting some pink snail
 like western canada as a young man but i above creatures with the water this type of fish knew that
 he turned up in high river george edworthy left with dan webster food was also present in the lower lake
 as a young lad and worked as a cowhand during their 1919 trip to kananaskis country in the lower lake
 even the dolly vardens for a number of ranchers in that area below had pink flesh lmost like a salmon
 we after he was married he went to work view of upper kananaskis lake in 1911 in thought probably that
 this could be for the forestry department while i theforeground is hidden lake attributed to the type of food available
