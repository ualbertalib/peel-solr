 gen was service slang for reliable information as opposed to scuttlebutt unconfirmed and the usually inaccurate rumour thus air navigation
 became known as the gen trade as it was the most intellectual if not the most glamorous air crew role
 the air navigator s trade really arose from that of world war one s air observer the second man in
 the aircraft he was navigator gunner bomb aimer wireless operator and photographer to indicate his job and his elite status
 he wore on his left breast a simple single winged 0 in his majesty s air forces this remained in
 use until after the beginning of world war p two 1 between 1918 and 1939 aerial warfare became tremendously complicated
 and if one man were to perform all the functions of the world war one observer the war above would
 have been long over before he was this crest for no 4 its edmonton was adopt adequately trained therefore the
 observed in 1942 er s role was broken down into several air crew trades one of which was that of

 should remain as pay 2 00 per day for commissioned sergeants the rank of all successful trainees ranks only for

 a salary of fifty dollars per month for the summer months only she boarded at mr marshall s and later
 at mr graham s a distance of four and five miles respectively from the school some time after the school
 house was built the good fellowship of the people of the district was threatened and we became smiths and browns
 the smiths were a giddy people who wanted to dance in the school house the browns opposed this alberta history

 dollars and paid for it by giving dances and the browns were allowed to use the organ on sunday and

 crops were finally cut and ‘ i stacked for we had a beautiful fall after the snow was gone ‘
 until 1908 turkey red fall wheat had been raised exclusively as it was considered that alberta s summers were too
 short to ripen spring wheat then the krewatch brothers bought two bushels of marquis wheat from the experimental farm for
 four dollars a bushel and after raising this sue cessfully for t wo years they sold it for seed and
 after the year 1912 very little fall wheat was grown between 1906 and 1907 most of the ab graham as

 1904 or 1905 the mining class sold out and left the dis edmonton in 1909 they amalgamated trict while the
 more progressive ones with the united farmers of alberta remained and enlarged their farms an improvement in our situation came
 by this time we were getting well estabwhen mr chisholm of washington pur lished and our pioneering days had ended
 chased eleven sections of land in the many of us were able to have some com halifax district just west
 of us being forts some bought more land others anxious to get it under cultivation he built granaries and stables
 and enlarged announced he would employ anybody their houses some even made visits to who wanted work farmers had work
 their homeland and a buggy or democrat enough to do at home but needed cash to was to be found
 on just about every farm carry on so many of them with their outfits went to work for mr chisholm
 many of the homesteaders have now that gave them a lift until the 1906 wheat gone some moved away and
 others were crop was harvested this was bountiful called by death now in 1931 i look out beyond expectation and
 the farmers were at the weed infested and wind blown delighted their joy however was short fields and my memory

 there was a large acreage of newly broken fields ready for fall seeding but we had to wait for the
 wheat to be threshed in order to get the seed required consequently the seeding was done late which caused the

 a large box of wooden as bait fishing was concerned so a couple of l matches on the table in

 valley of sheep creek it may now have another name as ‘ there were some promising coal deposits there is
 a sheep creek south of calgary but along and contiguous to the muskeg iver i remember it as a great
 trout stream where it entered the smoky so it was decided to run lease lines up that valley i trian
 this creek was of a good size and below the gulated across to a well marked stump and falls it
 had some splendid firm eastern brook we built a raft of half a dozen d ry logs the trout longer
 ones in the centre this way we had there i saw the biggest trout in all my a bow three
 cross pieces tied with picket experience outside of cold lake deep fish lines and four elevated oar locks consisting ches
 the cook and i were working on a of pegs four poles with pieces of packing foot bridge across the
 narrow cleft just cases provided the oars above the falls as usual i had a ball of cod the crossing
 was not easy with one man line and hook in my pocket together with mount hammel situated in the on
 each oar we lost about three hundred a bit of moose meat the indians gave us for yards in the
 crossing even though we angled bait i let out my line but apparently it fork of sheep creek and smoky
 upstream the first man that hooked onto got stuck on the bottom of the backwater the bushes on the opposite
 side was pulled to the side of the current but then the river contained some twenty off the raft the
 next two chaps got the rope line started going around in the pool so i around a snag and we
 were finall y able to knew i had hooked a fish i guided it as seams of coal of various
