 refuses to subniit that she had not lost her touch and gave her the to it eaton displays a feminist
 sensibility only confidence to return to the story she had earlier suggested by previous works one wonders if sketched and
 tried to sell to motion picture pro angella provides clues to the real winnifred eaton ducers the result was cattle

 charge is well fomumuded if it is not the m nanagers of the team in question should its jiustice to
 calgary prove that there is uso foundation for it if on the other hand the charge is based on truth
 it is decidedly in the interests of clean sport that it should be ventilated so as to prevent a recurrence
 of such objectionable tactics in the future if calgary cannot succeed in sporting matters on her merits she had better
 avoid sport altogether the goad name and reputation of this city are worth a good deal tsuore than any socalled
 sporting victory worked by means of objectionable tactics if the calgary teamsi are being traduced they have a substantial grievance
 but if the story which has been freely circulated is correct it is gratifying to think that they last the
 gamsue and that those who tried to put up ajob must have got what was certainly coming to them from
 our friends in the north and not a whit less note a couple of days later w keane of winnipeg
