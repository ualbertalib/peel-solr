 a pioneer exployer whose story is linked with jasper park by elsie park gowan this summer 1957 is the golden
 jubilee of jasper national park it is fifty years since that mountain region with its rich background of history and
 romance was dedicated to the refreshment and delight of all the people of canada so perhaps it is fitting that
 the historical society of alberta should mark the occasion by remembering a tourist traveller of fifty years ago a quaker
 lady in a buckskin coat who took the trail of the banff jasper highway in the days when the words
 filling station meant a place where there was good feed for horses mary schaffer rode into my life one morning
 in jasper when i talked to mrs press berry widow of a pioneer guide of the jasper region mrs berry
 told me that in 1908 when the valley was still unspoiled by highway or railroad a cultivated widow from philadelphia
 came riding from the c p r 200 miles away with a woman companion two guides and a string of
 pack horses she crossed the athabasca between moberly s and swift s and went on west over the yellowhead to
 mount robson mrs schaffer had written a book about alpine flowers and later another book about her travels old indian
 trails with a vivid picture of jasper before the g t p then mrs berry made a remark that clinched
 my interest she married her guide that did it i had to know more about the adventurous woman who left
 her name and the names of her friends on our alberta mountains so i went searching for mary schaffer in
 her own book in alpine journals in geographic records and in the memory of old timers i ve followed some
 of her trails on horseback i ve sat by the fireside of her house in banff among the lovely 18
 th century furniture that came from pennsylvania half a century ago this house is now the home of mrs charles
 reid who was edmee moore jack brewster s grand daughter there is a grandfather clock in the living room old
 enough to have struck the hours for benjamin franklin how it came to elsie park gowan of edmonton is a
 well known dramatic and radio writer for the c b c mary schaffer the quaker in buckskin is seen here
 on her favorite horse that here was a mountain region rivalling switzerland in grandeur it is not clear how early
 the c p r realized that scenery was one of their assets wheeler in his book the selkirk range gives
 it as one of the reasons for his topographical survey in addition to the mineral timber and other franchises he
 wrote a feature of much importance involving a very considerable source of revenue to the country has lately sprung into
 existence i refer to the inflow of tourists globe trotters hunters sightseers and banff is part of the history of
 canada s national parks it seems that after the c p r crossed the rockies in 1885 the news went

 then they turned back along order in council that outlawed the timtheir own trail to graveyard camp and ber cruiser
 from the mountains forever up the west branch of the saskatchewan indeed the wording of the statute shows to see
 the columbia ice fields from the that the original purpose in reserving south that frozen snow packed silent jasper forest
 park was the preservasea as mary called it where the rivers tion of the trees not the recreation of are
 born tourists the order in council was dated sept 14 1907 coming south from wilcox pass in august there was
 an encounter that has when that day came mrs schaffer overtones of comedy mrs schaffer woke had set out on
 a venture that was to up one morning to find six inches of snow identify for the first time one
 of jasper over everything she had just settled park s loveliest features back to sleep when someone coughed at early
 in september she crossed nigel her tent door she sat up to behold a pass then struck north east along
 the strange bearded spectacled and fully brazeau river she wanted to see clad man bowing as though in a draw
 brazeau lake and to explore towards ing room and doffing his spotless hat another lake said by the stoneys to
 lie he said i hope i don t intrude the north of the brazeau and called by them lady sat
 up in her sleeping bag bowed chaba imne beaver lake up to now as gracefully as possible and answered they
 had followed a trail blazed by some certainly not the visitor talked to geographer or mountaineer but white warren about
 the wilcox trail and went men had not yet identified this mysaway without anyone finding out who he terious chaba
 imne if they could find was although he did mention being at it it was truly their own fortress lake
 in 1893 after a while this date clicked in mary s mind and when perhaps they had left it too
 late in they passed the other outfit later in the the summer for in the brazeau region day she asked
 the stranger if he had luck ran out snow came down and the met dr coleman around fortress lake trail
 disappeared in a dreary wall of well he replied i happen to be l o rock icy clouds hid the
 country beyond coleman and that is my brother the and the disappointed explorers turned doctor over there back to make
 a nightmare trek over cataract pass the horses were hungry so here we were mary wrote fall with nothing to
 eat but heather mary ing over the man whose trails and camps was snow blind and sat on her pony
 in were all we had to read on the long days dumb misery scratched and bruised by on the athabasca
 dr coleman wrote trees along the trail the humans were in his book it was a delightful surprise hungry too
 they had a cache of food to have a charming woman ride out of in jimmy simpson s shack at
 graveyard the snow in the midst of the rockies and share our lunch of bannock bacon and they camped on
 the floor of the valley at pinto lake and the women waited tea there while warren and unwin with a
 few weeks earlier there had been the three strongest horses made an alla different encounter with quite a dii day
 trek over sunset pass and back ferent kind of man which proved the they left at 5 a m and
 came down out of the forest again long after dark with out on the emerald lake road near field 600
 pounds of grub and a letter from b c everybody cleaned up the last jimmy simpson morning in camp they
 thought they looked pretty good too until they struck from pinto lake they followed the the highway on the road

 reached the mid point of a public life spanning half a century as an influential critic of federal inertia and
 mismanagement in territorial administration as a public spirited citizen and as a constructive legislator he had already made far reaching
 contributions to the growth of the canadian north west as minister during the laurier regime he left an indelible mark
 upon the department of the interior he gave a new direction to canadian immigration policy and effected a more liberal

 north west abuses went unrectified the opposition press in alberta delighted to twit him about these unfulfilled promises but even
 the conservative calgary herald paid tribute to his lucidity and judgment and his ability to command support without dispensing patronage
 edmonton of course regarded him as its favorite son and his return from a session of the house as an
 occasion for a tumultuous public demonstration throughout the autonomy dispute of 1904 05 oliver was subjected to considerable criticism for
 his refusal to give unqualified support to the demands of the territorial assembly for provincial status he felt that the
 erection of the two projected provinces saskatchewan and alberta might well await further settlement and development of the west in
 order that better financial terms might be wrung from ottawa however in the final issue following his appointment to the
 cabinet as successor to clifford sifton he supported laurier s autonomy bills including dominion control of the public lands and
 resources of the two new provinces the hon frank oliver served as minister of the interior from 1905 to 1911

 finance the building of the hudson bay railway for five years oliver remained the firm friend of the liberal government

 for sledge dogs of them that night after it was dark on my return to civilization mose we rode northward
 and made a dry camp gradually faded from my memory one among the hills after our horses were day last
 winter 1883 i met joe healy picketed warner carried a saddle blan on broadway street during our talk ket to
 the top of a hill near by that he told me that mose was still alive overlooked our camp and
 there spread he made the trading post his headit he told mose to lie there and guard quarters but visited
 in the indian camps the camp and he added to his instruc a great portion of the time tions the
 caution no more noise from this on mose he grew in intelligence as the years rolled by healy told me
 that mose could i never again heard the dog s voice not talk or read or write and that he
 nightly he watched our camp in might be a little rusty in mathematics silence the approach of game that he
 but that he knew more than many men could not make out such as buffalo in and that he was
 a most delightful comrade under any circumstances the distance and travelling elk or antelope he announced by waking warner today
 i received a letter from healy often while lying on the northern plains written at silver city north west tern
 i have awakened with a start and a keen tory ed note this was in banff park sense of the
 presence of danger to see at the base of mount eisenhower let warner rifle in hand and mose at his
 it speak for itself side gazing intently into the darkness the dog understood as well as we that i lost
 a good and true friend this past his bark might betray our camp to the winter you knew him well
