 the largest school held here for some years the first requirement for this influx was quarters and sone new arrangements 
 were made the officers were accommodated in the new hospital building and tho former u r buildings at fort macauloy

 quite satisfactory 
 44 not quite go much can be said for the weather the first three weeks of the school found us 
 caught in the nost protracted cold spell here for many years with the result that the barracks squaare was often 
 quite unusable and a good deal of the drill had to be done at bay street armouries fortunately however the 
 snow cleared away and the winds warmed up by the time we began the tactical phase of the school and 
 the last half was very enjoyable 0:en 0:joyable our company mechanized transport came in very handy to supplement the r 
 c a 3 c on the tactical schemes and the introduction 0:in 0:troduction of hot hay box lunches proved distinctly 
 popular the royal school full course finished with a smoking concert held in the school mess at macauley on kth

 creditable showing the following sermon is the composition of a student officer on the school and was given at the 
 school smoker my dear fleak my text is taken from the third chapter of the second book of f fi 
 r 3rd verse para one mr oreedy commanded them saying go forth and teach the arts of war unto every 
 living creature thus unto a strange land came the prophet major edgar and his priests and scribes and leaser disciplec 
 who pitched their tabernacle at work point unto them flocked many strange people from distant places numbered among then were 
 hairy savages in gaudy skirts who carried curious fetishes in a bag of fur tis thought to be a continuation 
 of the fig leaf suspended over their forward parts there were members of wild irish tribes defender son of the 
 high priest hoodlum son of the war lord beaumont the navigator leese the bard franklin the elder feeney from the 
 hill country 0:count 0:ry a man of small stature who carried a queer cross bow behind 0:be 0:hind which he 
 hid and hurled from it stones upon the foe also a strange giant from the land of calgary who was 
 possessed 0:poss 0:essed of devils which caused him to consume away the food of three score ordinary men so that 
 the scullions were hard pressed to feed him the beasts of the field and the birds of the air fled 
 before him lest he fall upon them and devour them in hie great hunger and the chief disciple white came 
 unto the multitude and spake unto them in their own tongue saying oh ye of much brawn and little brain 
 have faith and we will lead thee thus they were led into the presence of the chief witch doctor who 
 taking them singly spake unto them saying breath in breath out and other mystic words thereafter they beheld a wonderous 
 0:won 0:derous sight for there issued 
 45 forth one captain sails from the tabernacle of the prophet mounted on a steed of steel which they called 
 a bic ycle among the lesser disciples were many who wore strange devices 0:de 0:vices on their arms stripes crowns 
 and the like whose chief concern was to move in stately manner uttering harsh throaty noises the while to impress 
 the multitude hear what st gibson says wave not your heads like unto the indswept corn hear also what st 
 bates said come hither and view ye strange ford car which is the ro r al chariot and they preached 
 of tactics which means lands afar off and unexplored and they knowing the land of tactics took the multitude by 
 green pastures and still waters unto that land and with drawings on pap varus explained 0:ex 0:plained away the mysteries 
 of the land but the multitude answered them not for they were without understanding of arms that were passing small 
 and of others again that were of greater size even unto several cubits did the priests and scribes preach unto 
 the multitude of the rifle and the mortar and yet of the wire that is barbed did they preach but 
 still the multitude answered them not for indeed there was no understanding within them and the priests and scribes and 
 the lesser disciples went unto the prophet with bowed heads and among them there was no rejoicing in this hour 
 was the heart of the prophet sore and he commanded 0:command 0:ed let the multitude be placed in boats of 
 divers shape and let them be driven from these shores lest the fury of the witless come upon even those 
 of my own flock who are now whole and when the g pointed time we s come the multitude departed 
 chastened in spirit unto other lands 000000000000000000 the birthday of our colonel in chief found us as usual very much 
 occupied with royal schools again e had to forego a holiday on that day catching it up at east er 
 an arrangement that has its points in that it gives us an unbroken week end in the afternoon of the 
 17th we had a gamo of football between 0:be 0:tween two scratch teams which resulted mainly in a lot of 
 good exorcise for all those playing and some excellent practice for the goalies meanwhile a party was preparing the fives 
 court for a smoking concert to bo held that evening departing somewhat from the usual the lives court was made 
 up as an esta oinet with tables for four or six and provided with a good stage made from part

 l ar by corporal l c morrison the married soldier of to day particularly if he is on the establishment 
 is infinitely better off than was his predecessor of a couple of centuries ago as a matter of fact marriage 
 in tile early days of the 3ritish army did not constitute a very serious bond shocking but nevertheless true however 
 it is fascinating this story of a omen who have followed the drum as wives of the fighting men from 
 earliest times women in varying shades of virtue have followed armies of all nations wars in the olden days were 
 leisurely affairs enough conducted on well defined principles in the wake toiled vast circuses of baggage and baggages if a 
 soldier was killed his widow rarely remained so above twenty four hours which rather links up with a note made 
 in 1306 by lady hunter in her journal where she recalls a hrs morrison no relation to the writer who 
 married six soldier husbands in succession a case of the triumph of hose over experience it is interesting to learn 
 that 579 women accompanied the quebec expedition general wolfe was shrewd enough to make use of them in his scheme 
 of discipline one unfortunate soldier guilty of some minor military offence was sentenced to ride the wooden horse for an 
 hour every day for a week just in a petticoat 0:petti 0:coat with a broom in his hand and a 
 placard to his back this is the reward of my merit imagine hike too hey doing this these regimental women 
 were hard as nails expert plunderers supreme partisans of the excellence of their own battalions and given to much fighting 
 it is comforting to recall that not one of the quebec women was a casualty despite the fact there was 
 no central heating a return rendered during the inter of 1759 60 records their survival en masse in excellent health 
 eating their rations and fit for their duties the duke of york in his 1794 campaign found women anything but 
 a boon end a blessing to men a number of them followed the guards brigade into action at tourcoing the 
 dag went against them and some of che ladies fell into the enemy hands gallic courtesy however proved itself a 
 few deys later a regimental band heeded the missing women back to the british lines good old band 
 52 the position of army woman received official attention in 1800 general calvart drew up regulations regarding the women who 
 were to accompany troops abroad such women being the lawful wives of soldiers were to be in the proportion of 
 six to every hundred men such women as went to portugal were treated as part of the regimental establishment and 
 figure in the parade states grouped to the right together with muleteers and animals each woman received a half ration 
 and each child a third pity the poor orderly room clerk if the lot of the soldier s ife was 
 hard on active service it was not a bed of roses in peace time there were no barracks in england 
 until 1792 except in a few old castles but in the first barrack regulations published commanding officers were permitted to 
 approve of the presence of women for the greater cleanliness and convenience of the soldier 11 most regiments allowed one 
 married woman for each troop room in return for their accomodation they had to wash mend and cook for the 
 men there were no sergeant cooks in those days the married couple took a corner berth and screened it off 
 with a blanket there is no chronicle as to what happened if the troops desired to play crown and anchor 
 after lights out surprisingly enough the system worked and even helped to improve the tone of barrack room life there 
 were of course herd cases among the women one 01d ilag used to wheedle money out of the recruits and 
 spend it on spirits rearing drunk she would return hone and beat up her husband until she was herself knocked 
 out in selfdefence 0:self 0:defence by the troops who would throw her a speechless bundle into bed some regiments had 
 their own method of reform first among them was the 11th hussars who set aside special barrack rooms for married 
 families but this was not always a success finding their old occupation of charring for the troops gone the ladies 
 quarrelled among themselves indeed some commanding officers went to the extreme of forbidding women in barracks at all notably in 
 london where barrack accomodation was of the worst description it wasn t until after the crimean ar that reform was 
 at hand the building of quarters was commenced the first examples contained only one room and a scullery since the 
 war however there have been great improvements in army married life special arrangements have gone a long way towards alleviating 
 the lot of the married soldier in the british army it is true he has to contend with the frequent 
 moves of his unit but even here he is helped his quarters contain all the essential continued on page 56

 57 old p p s is 9 we are pleased to publish the following letter from charlie palmer of vancouver 
 anent the celebration held there on the 17th march in honour of the birthday of the colonel in chief the 
 lady patricia ramsay dear sir i will endeavour to give you a report of the skirmish which occurred during the 
 evening of march 17th 1957 any slight discrepancies in times names or any other matters with which this report deals 
 must be set down to the fact that my own birthday occurred on the 17th of march in consequence of 
 which auspicious circumstance i became a walking casualty early in the day but had more or less sufficiently recovered by 
 the time fall in sounded to take a more or less intelligent interest in the proceedings and to add some 
 much needed charm and dignity to the head table the troops began to assemble in the legion canteen at about 
 7 30 p m and immediately rapid fire broke out with the result that several of the more enthusiastic boys 
 had narrow escapes from being shot some were almost half shot at 8 00 p m bugler harry bayliss sounded 
 stables or something and we all gathered round the tables which were tastefully decorated and well supplied the chair was 
 occupied by the president mr lyall fraser who opened the proceedings by asking all present to stand for a moment 
 with bowed heads in memory of our departed comrades the last post and reveille were then sounded before commencing on 
 the rations the report of the secretary treasurer was read and adopted then followed the election of officers for the 
 ensuing year and resulted in mr lyall fraser being re elected president mr c s palmer vice president and mr 
 harry findlow secretary treasurer all by acclamation this necessary business taking about three minutes 
 58 next on the order of business was the rum ration which was suitably disposed of and was followed by 
 a vigorous attack on the eats at this time i began to take notice and found that the chairman was 
 flanked on one side by col harry lotson representing the local militia units and on the other by col hm 
 iv iven at the seaie table were cnpwimacgrogor macintosh and capt jim christie also mr c 3 v hurley of 
 toronto amongst others present were mr hugh croed and mr s pi jennings from vancouver island altogether about seventy of 
 the old boys gathered up and notwithstandi g grey hairs bald heads and nonexistent 0:non 0:existent waist lines after that 
 jolt of rum and what not those boys shook twenty j oars off their shoulders like a duck sheds water 
 and they were just rarin l to go they had all been supplied with a copy of that immortal classic 
 the rik a dan doo mid hen that natural improssario capt macintosh got on the platform and led them in 
 song such e burst of sound was heard as has not been heard in vancouver since jerry mcgccr left for 
 ottawa during a break in the tumult the chairman by the exercise of some unsuspected magnetic power and coaipclli ng 
 personality and the persistent use of e very hcavj gavel succeeded in restoring comparative quietness during this lull the usual 
 toasts were given and replies to letters and telegrams of congratulation reed v c then had speeches from our guests 
 and officers of the old comr dos association 0:assoc 0:iation col niven and jia christie being received with tremendous applause 
 from this time on all became wrapped in a golden glow and the remaining period and tho incidents that occurred 
 seem like s half forgotten dream but i can assure you that there is no doubt that the 1937 annual 
 re u ioh of the princess patricians old domrndes association 0:assoc 0:iation vancouver n 0 w a s a great 
 success i may bo permitted to express the hope on behalf of the officers and committee that all our old 
 comrades may long be spared to join us on these occasions o o o sfo o o the nineteenth annual 
 dinner of tho patricia club of ottawa was held on larch 7th when a good number of ox patricia s 
 turned out to renew old friends and old associations the guest speaker of the evening was rt hon r b 
 bennett p c k c ll d e d dominion conservative leader who gave a stirring address on the importance 
 of the fighting forces in the life of the country following the great war said mr bennett great britain had 
 sought disarmament with all her strength the power and prostigo of the empire became less nd less in the european 
 continent and as a military factor she was not considered 
 59 realizing this fact he continued the british people with a sense of sacrifice unrivalled in the long history of 
 their country began to rearm reluctantly but with the certainknowledge 0:certain 0:knowledge that unless england led the way chaos in 
 the world was inevitable the effectiveness of the british umpire for maintenance of freedoai and liberty throughout the world the
