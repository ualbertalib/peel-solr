 valuable historical 0:his 0:torical record in the form of an inscribed 0:in 0:scribed plate of lead was discovered after having 
 been planted in the earth for one hundred and seventy years this record was deposited in the binic of the 
 missojri river in the year 1743 by a son of la verendrye the groat french canadian explorer and discoverer 0:discov 
 0:erer of what is now western canada and the adjoining territory included n the united states reproductions vt photographs of 
 the actual plate accompany 0:accom 0:pany this article there is a very interesting 0:in 0:teresting historical story connected with the 
 discovery of the country west of the upper missouri river by chevalier 0:cheva 0:lier de la verendrye and the depositing 
 by him of the metal plate in a bluff overlooking the missouri river on march 30 1743 as tangible evidence 
 that he had taken possession of the country for france the manner r t the recovery of this plate after 
 its long deposit in the earth is also interesting on february 13 last the writer as president of the winnipeg 
 canadian club gave as the subject of his inaugural 0:in 0:augural address the discovery of ib country west of lake 
 superior and if the upper missouri by la verendrye and incidentally stated as follows in the spring of 1742 la 
 verendrye a two sons with two men adventured from fort la reine to the missouii river and beyond till they 
 arrived at the rocky mountains which they reached on jan 1 1743 and returning arrived back at fort la reine 
 in july 1743 this expedition covered a vast territory hitherto not traversed by wjhite men and it was not till 
 fully sixty years later that the americans lewis and clark backed by unlimited n eans and supplies went over tiio 
 same ground and achieved renown therefor and earned for themselves a prominent place in the history of th 3 united 
 states compare this with the unrivalled successful efforts of the young sous of la verendrye wh jse names are scarcely 
 even known to t ie average canadian credited with be ig ordinarily well informed about three weeks after this address 
 was given the writer received privace information that a metal plate en sraved with the fleur de lys of france 
 and an inscription by la verendrye had just been found by a young girl when playing in the school ground 
 at fort pierre which is situated on the west bank of the missouri nver where the bad river joins that 
 stream and opposite to the city of pierre the capital 0:capi 0:tal of the state of south dakota immediately 0:im 
 0:mediately people in pierre were communicated 0:com 0:municated with and fnally in correspondence 0:corres 0:pondence with mr doane robinson secretary 
 and superintendent of the department 0:de 0:partment of history of the state of south dakota that gentleman stated that the 
 verendrye metal plate which is now officially in possession of his department was found exactly as indicated 0:in 0:dicated at 
 fort pierre on a hill near the missouri and the bad river as recorded 0:re 0:corded in chevalier de la 
 verendry e s journal which is an official document on file in the government office in paris france where it 
 has been much consulted by historical writers cf canada and the united states through the assistance of mr robinson 0:rob 
 0:inson and mr w o reilly of pierre excellent photographs were obtained showing both sides of the plate these photographs 
 are covered in an application 0:applica 0:tion for copyright but mr o reilly the applicant has very kindly and courteously 
 0:cour 0:teously consented that the writer make use of them for publication this present 0:pres 0:ent publication is therefore the 
 flrst which has been made of this extremely important long buried historical i ecord there are a number of points 
 now in dispute between historians regarding 0:re 0:garding the route followed by la verendrye s 0:ver 0:endrye 0:s sons on 
 this exploration n hich will be definitely settled by the pypipearance after 170 years of this metal piate and consequently 
 this publication will be no doubt eagerly vvelcomed by all writers and students o the history of western canada and 
 the north western states chevalier de la verendrye by deposivmg 0:de 0:posivmg this metal plate in the names of king 
 louis the fifteenth u france and of the marquis de beauharnois 0:beau 0:harnois governor of canada took possession 0:pos 0:session 
 for france of the country discovered 0:dis 0:covered by him and the plate therefor 0:there 0:for in a manner constitutes 
 the original 0:orig 0:inal patent or deed by right of discovery 0:dis 0:covery of the country west of the upper 
 missouri river in 1803 france ceded to the united states all of her then remaining western 0:west 0:ern american possessions 
 this plate is a veritable and tangible proof if the very foundation of france s claim 
 2 to that part of the territory so ced jd to the united states this method of taking possession of 
 a new territory was common to all the early european explorers who either deposited metal plates in the soil or 
 placed them upon posts firmly planted in the ground a case of this kind is specifically described 0:des 0:cribed in 
 the recorded narrative i f captain luke foxe who voyaged lito hudson s bay in the year 1631 on his 
 arrival at what is now port nelson he found lying upon the ground a cross which had been erected by 
 captain button who had first discovered 0:discov 0:ered that territory in 1613 fote writes in his journal i caused a

 0:de 0:fender of the faith the 15th august 1631 this land is called new wales what led to the exploration 
 which determined the depositing of the metal plate pierre gaulthier de varenne de iv verendrye the father of the missouri 
 explorers was born at three rivers quebec in the year 1686 he served in the french army in europe and 
 was nearly killed at the battle of malpaquet 0:malpa 0:quet where he was shot through the body and received several 
 saber wounds and was left for dead en the field some time after his return to canada he was placed 
 in charge of a post at nipigon lake superior where in 1728 jie heard of the country w iiit of 
 that great lake through accounts given by indians in 1730 he arranged with the marquis de beauharnois the french governor 
 of canada a plan for the conducting of an exploration of the west which combined with the work of exploring 
 the establishing of forts or trading posts in order to enable 0:en 0:able him to defray tne cost of his 
 expeditions 0:ex 0:peditions by profits from the fur trade he also arranged with merchants to advance him supplies of goods 
 suitable for the indian trade to give some idea of the utter lack of any definite informatibn regarding 0:re 0:garding 
 the country that verendrye had decided to penetrate it will be interesting 0:in 0:teresting to quote from a document now 
 in the dominion archives at ottawa being a communication from the marquis de beauharnois to the french colonial minister in 
 paris concerning verendrye s venture he must also have very accurate maps if new mexico and california so that he 
 may not go and throw himself into the gulf of mexico whereinto the red river of which he speaks has 
 all appearances of disemboguing la verendrye during the following few years under most discouraging 0:dis 0:couraging conditions and after great 
 hardships succeeded in establishing a number of fortified trading posts west of lake superior in hitherto unexplored territory these included 
 fort pierre fort frances fort st charles west side lake of the woods fort maurepas mouth of the winnipeg river 
 fort rouge a shon lived 0:shon 0:lived post within the limits of the present 0:pres 0:ent city of winnipeg fort 
 la reine portage la prairie and some others to the north on lake manitoba and the saskatchewan river it was 
 in the year 1738 that he established 0:estab 0:lished fort la reine and immediately after its construction accompanied by his 
 two sons and some of his men he explored the country in a southwest direction reaching as far as the 
 mandan 0:man 0:dan villages on the missouri river in the present state of north dakota this exploration was made in 
 pursuance 0:pursu 0:ance of his great expectation of findiuj a route to the western sea pacific ocean which was the 
 supreme goal of the early french explorers west of lake superior however he could not gain from these indians any 
 definite ir formation as to a possible route and after personally suffering very great hardships he managed in the following 
 february to return to fort la reine v here he found nearly the whole of the inhabitants numbering some 42 
 almost starved to death for some years la verendrye and his twd sons were occupied 0:oc 0:cupied in extending their 
 explorations to the north and northwest and in endeavoring by visits of the father to quebec to defeat the machinations 
 of his enemies who in the case of his nerchant creditors insisted that he was utilizing his fur trading operations 
 solely as an adjunct to his explorations 0:explora 0:tions while on the other haid envious enemies were accusing him to 
 the frenoh court of neglecting his duty as an explorer in the interests of his trade in furs which latter 
 they claimed was greatly enriching him though as a matter of fact he was rapidly becoming impoverished at last in 
 the spring of 1742 the two sons with only two men again adventured 0:ad 0:ventured from fort la reine in 
 a determined 0:de 0:termined attempt to explore the missouri 0:mis 0:souri river to its source and find a route to 
 the western sea 
 3 an account of the exploration by la verendrye s sons historians descriptions of the explorations 0:ex 0:plorations of the 
 missouri river country 0:coun 0:try by the two sons of la verendrye are practically all based on the journal kept 
 by the young men during their travels which document yet remains intact in the archives of the french government in 
 paris the account of the travels of the sons here given follows 0:fol 0:lows in the main closely along the 
 lines of a special article on the subject by the historian francis parkman and entitled the discovery of the rocky 
 mountains which was written some four years before the issue of his twovolume 0:two 0:volume book half a century of 
 conflict 0:con 0:flict a chapter of which conveys much the same information but under a different heading la verendrye s 
 eldest surviving son pierre his firstborn jean baptiste having been killed together with a priest and some twenty men on 
 an island in the lake of the woods in the year 1736 with a younger brother known afterwards as the 
 chevalier de la verendrye took up the adventure and with two canadian followers set out for the mandans on april 
 29 1742 following the river assiniboine to the mouth of mouse souris river they ascended that stream crossed to the 
 missouri and reached the principal mandan village after a journey of about three weeks from fort la reine here they 
 found themselves the guests of one of the most interesting tribes on the continent nearly three quarters of a century 
 ago the mandans were almost exterminated by the smallpox but the pencil of the excellent artist charles bodiner who accompanied 
 i rince maximilan of wied to their village 0:vil 0:lage in 1832 and the faithful brush of the painter catlin 
 who visited them a few years later have preserved them to posterity essentially unchanged since the journey of the brothers 
 la verendrye what the young travellers saw was t cluster of lodges each forty or fifty feet wide shaped like 
 a flattened dome strongly framed of trunks ot trees and sap ing poles and covered with a thick matting of 
 willow branches over which was laid a bed of earth and clay two or three feet deep these capacious dwellings 
 were grouped compactly round a central area which served for games dances and the strange religious 0:religi 0:ous ceremonies practiced 
 by the tribe the sacred medicine lodge was distinguished 0:dis 0:tinguished from the rest by three or four tall poles 
 planted before it each with an effigy at the top looking much like a scarecrow and intended as a sacrifice 
 to the spirits the village was protected by a rude palisade and ditch for the mandans were surrounded 0:surround 0:ed 
 by enemies the mandans did not know the way to the pacific but they told the brothers 0:broth 0:ers that 
 they expected a speedy visit from a certain tribe or band called horse indians who could guide them thither it 
 is impossible to identify these people with any known tribe all the tribes of that country might at this time 
 have claimed the name the brothers waited for them in vain until past midsummer the season was too far advanced 
 for longer delay and they hired two mandans to guide them to the customary haunts of the horse indians they 
 set out horseback their scanty baggage and their stock of presents being carried no doubt by pack animals their general 
 course was west southwest the black hills lay at a distance on their left and the upper missouri on their 
 right the country they traversed was a rolling prairie well covered for the most part with grass and watered with 
 small alkaline streams creeping towards the missouri with an opaque whitish current 0:cur 0:rent over beds of sandy clay there 
 was little or no wood except along these watercourses i noticed said the chevalier la verendrye earths of different colors 
 blue green red or black white as chalk or yellowish like ochre this was probably in the bad lands of 
 the little missouri where these party colored earths form a conspicuous feature in the bare and barren bluffs cut into 
 fantastic shapes by storms and floods for twenty days they saw no human being the plains says their journal were 
 alive with game deer sprang from the rank reedy grass of the river bottoms buffalo 0:buf 0:falo tramped by in 
 ponderous columns or dotted the pale swells of the distant prairie with their grazing multitudes antelope approached with the curiosity 
 0:curi 0:osity of their species to gaze at the passing horsemen then fled like the wind and as the party 
 neared the hilly uplands of the yellowstone they saw herds of elk and flocks of mountain 0:moun 0:tain sheep wolves 
 white and gray howled about their camp all night and in the dusk of evening the coyote seated on the 
 grass with nose turned to the sky saluted them with a confusion 0:con 0:fusion of yelpings as if half a 
 score of petulant voices were pouring together from the throat of one small beast the ground was often honeycombed for 
 a mile or more with the holes of the curious little marmot called the prairie dog which uttered its squealing 
 0:squeal 0:ing bark as it came near and then dived into its burrow on the 11th of august they reached 
 a hill or group of hills apparently not far west of the little missouri it was here that they hoped 
 to find the horse indians but the place was a solitude they built a hut made fires that the smoke 
 might attract any indians roaming near and reconnoitred the country every day from the top of the hills at length 
 on the 14th of s september they saw a spire of smoke 
 4 photograph by w o reilly pierre s d obverse of lead tablet the tablet is about eight inches in 
 width the latin inscription on the obverse shown above is as follows anno xxvi regni ludovici xv pro rege 11 
 lustrissimo domino domino marchione de beauharnois mdccxxxxi petrus gauthier de laverenderie posuit that is in the twenty sixth year of 
 the reign of louis xv in the name of the king our thrice illustrious sovereign and for monsieur the marquis 
 de beauharnois peter walter de laverendrye placed this tablet 1741 the fleurs de lys of the royal arms of france 
 are seen at the top of the tablet and at each corner 
 5 photograph by w o reilly pierre s d reverse of lead tablet the back of the tablet is much 
 more corroded than the front the inscription cut with a knife is as follows pose par le chevalyer de lavr 
 te st louy la londette a miotte le 30 mars 1743 the to means temoins witnesses 0:wit 0:nesses the two 
 engaged men accompanying de ia verandrye were louis de la londette and a miotte the inscription tranlated is as follows 
 deposited by the chevalier de la verandrye witnesses st louis de la londette a miotte march 30 1743 the difference 
 between the date on the obverse and the date on the reverse is due of course to the fact that 
 the former date was stamped on the tablet before the departure of the expedition from quebec the latter date being 
 that of the actual burying of the tablet as explained in the article it is somewhat strange that the signature 
 of the chevalier s brother who was with him on the expedition does not appear on the tablet 
 6 on the distant prairie one of their mandan guides had left them and gone back to his village the 
 other with one of the frenchmen went towards 0:to 0:wards the smoke and found a camp of indians whom the 
 journal calls les beaux hommes and who were probably crows a tribe remarkable for stature and symmetry who long claimed 
 that region as their own they treated the visitors well and sent for the other frenchmen to come to their 
 lodges where they were received 0:re 0:ceived with great rejoicing the remaining 0:re 0:maining mandan however became frightened for the 
 crows were enemies 0:ene 0:mies of his tribe and he soon followed 0:follow 0:ed his companion on his solitary march 
 homeward xne urotners remained twenty one days in the crow camp much perplexed 0:per 0:plexed for want of an interpreter 
 the tribes of the plains have in common 0:com 0:mon a system of signs by which they communicate with each 
 other and it is likely that the brothers had learned it from the sioux or assiniboines with whom they had 
 been in familiar intercourse 0:in 0:tercourse by this or some other means they made their hosts understand 0:under 0:stand that 
 they wished to find the horse indians and the crows being soothed by presents offered some of their young men 
 as guides they set out on the 9th of october following a southwestern course in two days they met a 
 band of indians called by them the little foxes and on the 15th and 17th two villages of another unrecognizable 
 0:un 0:recognizable horde named pioya s rom la verendrye s time to our own this same village has always been 
 given to the encampments of the wandering 0:wan 0:dering people of the plains all these nomadic communities joined them and 
 they moved together southward till they reached at last the lodges of the long sought horse indians they found them 
 in the extremity of distress 0:dis 0:tress and terror their camp resounded 0:resound 0:ed with howls and wailings and not 
 without cause for the snakes or shoshones a formidable people living farther westward had lately destroyed seventeen villages killing the 
 warriors and old women and carrying off the i young women and children as slaves i none of the horse 
 indians had ever seen the pacific but they knew a j people called gens de tare or bow indians who 
 they said had traded 1 in that quarter to the bow indians i therefore the brothers resolved to go i 
 and by dint of gifts and promises they 1 persuaded their hosts to show them the way after marching southwestward 
 0:southwest 0:ward for several days they saw the distant prairie covered with the pointed 0:point 0:ed buffalo skin lodges of 
 a great indian camp it was that of the bow indians who appear to have been one of the bands 
 of the western sioux the predominant race in this region not one in five hundred of them could ever have 
 seen a white man and we may imagine their amazement at the arrival 0:arri 0:val of the strangers who followed 
 by stilting crowds were conducted to the lodge of the chief thus far says la verendrye we had been well 
 received in all the villages 0:vil 0:lages we had passed but this was nothing compared with the courteous manners of 
 the great chief of the bow indians who unlike the others was not self interested in the least and who 
 took excellent care of everything belonging to us the first inquiry of he travelers was for the pacific but neither 
 the chief nor his tribesmen knew anything of it except what they had heard from snake prisoners taken in war 
 the frenchmen were surprised at the extent 0:ex 0:tent of the camp which consisted of many separate bands the chief 
 explained 0:ex 0:plained that they had been summoned from far and near for a grand war party against that common 
 foe of all the snakes in fact the camp resounded 0:resound 0:ed with war songs and war dances l come 
 with us said their host we are going towards the mountains here you can see the great water that you 
 are looking for we continued our march says la verendrye sometimes south southwest 0:south 0:south 0:west and now and then 
 northwest our numbers constantly increasing by villages of different tribes which join ed us the variations of their course were 
 probably due to the difficulties of the country which grew more rugged 0:rug 0:ged as they advanced with broken hills 
 traces of dingy green sage bushes and bright swift streams edged with cottonwood and willow hurrying northward to join the 
 yellowstone 0:yel 0:lowstone at length on jan 1 1743 they saw the rocky mountains probably the bighorn range a hundred 
 and twenty miles east of the tellowstone park a council of all the allied bands was now called and the 
 frenchmen were asked to take part in it the questions discussed 0:dis 0:cussed were how to dispose of the women 
 0:wo 0:men and children and how to attack the enemy having settled their plans the chiefs begged their white friends 
 not to abandon them and the younger of the two the chevalier consented to join the warriors and aid them 
 with advice though not with arms the tribes of the western plains rarely go on war parties in winter and 
 this great expedition must have been the result of unusual exasperation the object was to surprise the snakes in the 
 security of their winter camp and strike a deadly blow which would have been impossible in summer on jan 8 
 the whole body stopped to encamp 0:en 0:camp choosing no doubt after their invariable winter custom a place sheltered from 
 wind and supplied with water and fuel here the squaws and children were to remain while most of the warriors 
 advanced against the enemy by pegging the lower edge of the lodge skin to the ground and piling a ridge 
 of stones and earth upon it to keep out the air fastening with wooden skewers the flap of hide that 
 covered the entrance and keeping a constant fire they could pass a winter endurable to indians though smoke filth vermin 
 bad air the crowd and the total absence of privacy would make it a purgatory to any civilized white man 
 the chevalier left his brother to watch over the baggage of the party which was stored in the lodge of 
 the great chief while he himself with his 
 7 two canadians joined the advancing warriors they were on horseback marching with a certain order and sending watchmen to 
 reconnoitre the country from the tops of the hills their movements were so slow that it was twelve days before 
 they reached the mountains which says la verendrye are for the most part well wooded and seem very high he 
 longed to climb their great snowencumbered 0:snow 0:encumbered peaks fancying that he might then see the pacific and never dreaming 
 that more than eight hundred 0:hun 0:dred miles of mountains and forests still lay between him and his goal through 
 the whole of the past century 0:cen 0:tury the favorite haunts of the southern 0:south 0:ern division of the snakes 
 were in the valleys of wind and green rivers it is likely that they were so in 1743 in which 
 case the war party would not only have reached the bighorn mountains 0:moun 0:tains but have pushed farther on within 
 0:with 0:in full sight of the great wind river range be this as it may their scouts reached the chief 
 winter camp of the snakes and found it abandoned with lodges still standing and many household 0:house 0:hold possessions left 
 behind the enemy had discovered their approach and fled instead of encouraging the allies this news filled them with terror 
 0:ter 0:ror for they feared that the snake warriors might make a circuit to the rear and fall upon the 
 camp where they had left their women and children the great chief spent all his eloquence in vain nobody would 
 listen to him and with characteristic fickleness they gave over the enterprise and retreated 0:retreat 0:ed in a panic our 
 advance was made in good order but not so our retreat says the chevalier s journal everybody fled his own 
 way our horses though good were very tired and got little to eat he was one day riding with his 
 friend the great chief when looking behind them he missed his two french attendants hastening back in alarm he found 
 them far in the rear quietly feeding their horses under the shelter of a clump of trees he had scarcely 
 joined them when he saw a party of fifteen hostile indians steathily creeping 0:creep 0:ing forward covered by their bull 
 hide shields he and his men let them approach 0:ap 0:proach and then gave them a few shots on which 
 they immediately ran off firearms being to them an astounding 0:astound 0:ing novelty the three frenchmen now tried to rejoin 
 the great chief and his band but the task was not easy the prairie bare of snow and hard as 
 flint showed no trace of foot or hoof and it was by rare good fortune that they succeeded 0:suc 0:ceeded 
 on the second day not in overtaking 0:over 0:taking the chief but in reaching the camp where the women and 
 children had been left they found them all in safety the snakes had not attacked 0:attack 0:ed them and the 
 panic of the warriors 0:war 0:riors was causeless it was feb 9 they were scarcely housed when a blizzard set 
 in and on the night of the 10th the plains were buried in snow the great chief had not appeared 
 with such of his warriors as he could persuade 0:per 0:suade to follow him he made a wide circuit to 
 find the trail of the lost frenchmen but to his great distress had completely failed it was not till five 
 days after the arrival 0:ar 0:rival of the chevalier and his men that the chief reached the camp more dead 
 than alive in the words of the journal all his hardships were forgotten when he found his white friends safe 
 for he had given them up for lost his sorrow turned to joy and he could not give us attention 
 and caresses enough the camp broke up and the allied bands dispersed the great chief and his followers moved slowly 
 through the snowdrifts toward the east southeast accompanied by the frenchmen thus they kept on till the ist of march 
 when the two brothers learning that they were approaching 0:ap 0:proaching the winter village of a people called gens de 
 la petite cerise or choke cherry indians sent one of their men with a guide to visit them the man 
 returned in ten days bringing 0:bring 0:ing a message from the choke cherry indians inviting the frenchmen to their lodges 
 the great chief of the bowmen who seems to have regarded his young friends with mingled affection respect 0:res 0:pect 
 and wonder was grieved at the thought of losing them but took comfort 0:com 0:fort when they promised to visit 
 him again provided that he would make his abode near a certain river which they pointed out to this he 
 readily agreed and then with mutual regret they parted the frenchmen repaired 0:repair 0:ed to the village of the choke 
 cherry indians who like the bowmen were probably a band of sioux hard by their lodges which stood near the 
 missouri 0:mis 0:souri the brothers buried a plate of lead graven with the royal arms and raised a pile of 
 stones in honor of the governor of canada they remained at this place till april 1743 then mounting their horses 
 again followed the missouri upward to the village of the mandans which they reached on the 18th of may after 
 spending a week here they joined a party of assiniboines journeyed with them towards fort la reine and reached it 
 on the 2nd of july to the great relief of their father 0:fa 0:ther who was waiting i suspense having 
 neard nothing of them for more than a year parkman writes further sixtytwo 0:sixty 0:two years later when the vast 
 western 0:west 0:ern regions then called louisiana had just been ceded to the united states captains lewis and clark left 
 the mandan villages with thirty two men traced the missouri to the mountains penetrated the wastes beyond and made their 
 way to the pacific the first stages of that remarkable exploration 0:explor 0:ation were anticipated by the brothers la verendrye 
 they did not find the pacific but they discovered the rocky mountains or at least that part of them to 
 which the name properly belongs 0:be 0:longs for the southern continuation of the great range had long been known to 
 the spaniards their bold adventure was achieved not at the charge of a government but at their own cost and 
 that of their father not with a band of well equipped men but with only two followers
