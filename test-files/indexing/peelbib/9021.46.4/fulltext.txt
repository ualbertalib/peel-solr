 increasingly unpredictable to be arraigned a record crowd gathered drama inside the building while three thousand more massed along the
 sidewalk while these considerations turned the outside several features of the crime middleton murder into a major public fuelled this
 public fascination first spectacle for police chief thomas there was the brutal nature of the murder mackie it provided a
 critical test of his police bungling disharmony itself the body in question had been authority and leadership aged fortydiscovered early
 on the morning of 21 five mackie had been a policeman for within the force and an november 1911 lying
 in the snow more than twenty years serving first in covered ground by the cpr tracks in greenoch scotland before
 coming to outmanoeuvred prosecution east calgary its head had been beaten calgary in 1903 within three years he repeatedly by
 a heavy instrument of was promoted to sergeant and in 1909 v v v resulted in the resignation of some
 kind and its throat slashed from replaced tom english as chief of police ear to ear blood covered the corpse
 s english had held this position since v v police chief thomas mackie hands suggesting a final futile struggle 1891
 but his rough and ready frontier to stave off death and stained the style of policing had increasingly fallen surrounding

 footprints leading to the mackie s quiet demeanour and reserved nearby railway tracks marked the man s character they believed
 were more been marked by scandal and doomed flight from his assailants such suited to the needs of a maturing
 city was the scene that greeted the police as accordingly he was given the dual task embarrassment they arrived that
 morning to begin their of cleaning up both the city and the investigation 2 image of the police force itself

 arrested by the police turned refusal to provide him with greater out to be none other than the victim s
 manpower or to adequately compensate own brother william middleton the his existing officers as he wrote in his raised spectre
 of fratricide lent the crime annual report for 1910 an additional ghoulish appeal a third and final element was the
 nature of the at the present time i have but thirtypress coverage that the whole incident six constables for regular
 street duty received calgary s three daily this i may say falls short of the newspapers the herald alberta i
 and number allocated to other forces in news telegram reported events in cities the same size as calgary close detail

 to continue in the figures involved in addition a series of service any length of time 5 alberta history autumn
 1998 fl as a result mackie ran an increasingly validate or repudiate such accusations bitter and divided police force whose
 morale was steadily being eroded the investigation did not begin meanwhile his own position as chief auspiciously it took a
 full forty minutes was complicated by two further factors for the first officer constable alex cheyne to arrive on the
 scene and first by 1911 there had grown a general another hour passed before the arrival of fear or perception
 among calgarians that coroner dr charles davies davies their city was in the grip of a crime determined that the
 as yet unidentified wave one precipitated by the rapid man had been killed shortly after process of urbanization arrests for
 midnight but neither of the constables vagrancy theft common assault and who patrolled the local beat reported drunk and disorderliness
 had all risen seeing or hearing anything unusual a significantly over the past five years fact the herald described as
 baffling this may of course been the result of a cpr night watchman later told improved policing under mackie but
 it reporters that he had heard or fancied was not perceived that way instead as he heard someone moaning about
 the herald remarked in november 1911 midnight but could not be sure of this there is a prevailing opinion among
 the no one else had seen or heard respectable law abiding people of the anything city that the rowdy element
 has been increasing in numbers with great the police were no luckier with the promoted in order to clean up
 rapidity lately among the undesirable evidence gathered from the scene in the element the police force of this city is

 of sexual assault laid against some wheat chaff found in his trouser sexual assault laid against constable bert fisher mackie

 constable bert fisher by punching out the chief in the middle weeks which the police took to be the of
 a crowded police station a victim s name that apart from the fact subsequent inquiry into the whole affair that
 the man s boots appeared to be served only to reveal the depth and brand new was all that the
 investigating breadth of corruption and inefficiency officers had to go on within the force 4 as early reports of the
 crime passed over above the combined effect of all these chief mackie s desk that morning he circumstances was to
 place considerable must have felt a growing sense of police chief thomas mackie pressure on mackie to solve the murder
 disquiet the lack of material evidence right of john middleton in quick fashion or witnesses rendered a quick solution to

 william middleton also offered his own at the undertakers and was able to make theory as to how his brother

 one recently been paid off by king s ranch of whom held him while the other beat and was later
 enticed to the mill him with a heavy instrument probably a whereupon the stranger killed him he chisel he thought
 mason then went to had a weakness of taking up with people the murder scene on ninth avenue above he
 knew nothing about and telling them where he in fact discovered the actual view of the cpr stalion on ninth
 all about his affairs william explained murder weapon a two foot iron bar with avenue fcz ving centre street the

 the bar during their own inquiries about them or trying to learn search earlier that morning mason left it right
 anything of their characters 7 there not wishing to compromise the a report of the murder official investigation and only
 after the investigation was carried in the william middleton s account appeared police had made an arrest did mason calgary
 alberta i december 2 to satisfy the police who resumed their inform them where they might find the 1911 search
 for his brother s murderers probable murder weapon 9 however at least two men were not convinced by his explanation
 one of mason s suspicions grew when the these was detective robert tucker the police revealed that the victim by
 now rnwmp officer assigned to the case identified as john middleton had tucker had discovered that middleton brought just fifty
 dollars in cash with had not as he claimed left immediately him to calgary surely this was too for cochrane
 upon learning that the small a sum to warrant such a vicious murdered man was his brother but attack he
 thought on learning that instead had remained at the calgary middleton s brother was also in calgary boarding house for
 some time then hoping to close some real estate deals when he did eventually arrive in mason s doubts hardened
 and he quickly cochrane middleton had not gone to developed a plan to find out more u alberta history autumn
 1998 mason devised a simple but effective preparation of a fight middleton was plan he first persuaded a local real
 outnumbered however and soon thnee men took estate company to hire william quietened down whereupon tucker middleton as a security
 guard to watch arrested him on suspicion of murder and over their property then posing as a took him to
 the police station where he part in killing salesman for the company he and was questioned further 2 middleton drove

 neither the police nor the then possess he again drew attention to prosecution led by frederick selwood the large amount
 of information that was happy with the strength of their had appeared in the newspapers which case despite the suspicious
 behaviour had prejudiced public against his clients of john anderson and william before they had even been arraigned middleton the
 fact remained that sanders discounted this complaint and evidence of their guilt remained largely once more agreed to adjourn the
 hearing circumstantial 24 although tucker had until the following wednesday 27 thanks to help from john mason located and retrieved
 the iron bolt used shortly before 3 00 p m on the to bludgeon middleton it was later appointed day
 william middleton was a inadvertently destroyed before it could brought into the courtroom for the third be presented at the
 hearing the knife time to hear details of the charge against used to slash his throat remained him this time
 the prosecution was undiscovered ln fact the strongest ready to proceed although seiwood evidence that the police possessed was made
 no reference to the long awaited kate anderson s alleged confession to fingerprint tests instead following brief jeanne mclaughlin and
 it was far from testimony from a number of witnesses certain that they could depend on this the most notable
 development at this even though she had sworn on oath to point was nolan s successful challenge repeat this confession
 in court 24 to the prosecution s request to use the same evidence against all three of the an additional
 problem facing the accused instead nolan argued the prosecution was that even as the hearing crown should proceed against each
 of opened they still awaited the return of the accused separately consequently crucial test results from ottawa john and kate
 anderson were further fingerprints had been found on various remanded pending completion of the of the bloody items found on
 the body hearing against william middleton the but as calgary s police lacked any significance of this development was fingerprinting
 facilities they had sent that kate anderson s uncorroborated above these items to ottawa for testing confession could miow be
 used only consequently selwood requested that against her and miot against either of the gilbert e sanders former the hearing
 be adjourned for a week two men lacking any concrete evidence mounted police q cer was the we will be
 able to give some evidence that linked middleton or john anderson police magistrate who held a at the next appearance

 that i cannot work with chief mackie as he is absolutely useless 3 out mackie was quick to deny tucker
 s allegations but conceded that it would be well for all concerned if an investigation were held into the city
 police force that was on 12 january just three days later however mackie pre empted any such investigation by 0
 offering his own resignation it was quickly and no doubt thankfully accepted by the mayor 9 mackie s departure cannot
 have come as a complete surprise the press certainly 4 seemed ready for this development much as the herald from
 a personal semise regrets the resignation of mr mackie editorialized that paper the next day iii a public semise it
 recognizes that his retirement was the only way out of the present difficulties with this retirement the commissioners will have
 the opportunity for which they have been craving namely the chance of reorgamiizimig the police force on an efficient basis
 37 this last remark was as it happened the dismissal of charges disimigenuous to say the least as against john

 as needed a supervisor he was not yet one of the victims of the frog lake ready to be a

 lestanc later wrote that in their the native people in that area and a year imagination they could see a
 lovely little later he asked fafard to go there and mission there was good pasturage and found a mission 2
 the indiamis had taken fertile soil they could already taste the treaty but had not yet chosen their good milk
 cream and butter that their reserves many were moving back and cows could provide they looked forth in more or
 less vain attempts to around they listened to mckay they find buffalo and live in their old way a prayed
 hoping for inspiration as to how little longer a temporary mission should to proceed alberta history autumn 1998 just then
 an old indian chief came to them asking for medicine he said words to this effect there is sickness among
 our horses there is sickness among the buffalo some of our people have died from eating the meat of sick
 buffalo we re afraid to go to the plains unless we have medicimie fafard and lestanc saw this as a
 call fromii providence they sharpened their axes wrote lestanc and set to work a location was chosen and to use
 lestanc s words everyomie became a carpemiter even factor mckay lent a hand before many weeks had passed they had
 built a rude log building thirty feet lomig by seventeen feet wide on november 1 the building was consecrated as
 chapel sacristy residemice kitchen and shed all under the name of st jean francois regis fafard had looked farther ahead
 however while the building was under construction he used the oxen to plow a field in which he would plant
 potatoes and barley in the spring he also laid the foundation for what he hoped would become the mission s
 school space was always at a premium in the little mission in one corner of the building an area eight
 feet long by six feet wide was set apart for use as a church and separated from the rest of
 the interior by a curtain later this curtaimi was replaced by a partition and by a door which when opened
 concealed bunk beds sleeping on the floor was taken for granted the early morning was when all took solace in
 comparing themselves to the early christians as lestanc pointed out the shortage of wash basins meant that before everyone had
 washed prayer had begun for one meditation for another mass for a third and through all of this activity came
 the noises and odours that accompanied the preparation of breakfast in the kitchen this was especially true when retreats were
 held lestanc wrote from experience and we are fortunate that he did for otherwise above this 1 ijlj j of

 the little st jean françois 0:francois regis mission at fort pitt with it as headquarters lestanc and fafard went about their
 work among the native people lestanc began the work of establishing a church at the growing little village of battleford
 which had been designated the territorial capital just the year before he also followed the natives onto the plains when
 they hunted fafard travelled as extensively as he could since lacking a dog team and cariole he was restricted to
 visiting the places which mckay the hudson s bay factor visited in the course of company business in the spring
 father fafard not only plowed more land at pitt for cultivation but plowed fields for native people in the neighbourhood
 who wanted to grow crops as well the field prepared in the previous fall was seeded to barley and potatoes
 father bourguine arrived from st albert he suffered terribly from epilepsy amid could not be part of there was no
 other choice in the summer of 1879 the surveyor ga sinipson was sent to frog lake to survey a reserve
 there 4 fafard and his friends at st jean françois 0:francois regis probably realized that the handwriting was on the wall
 the mission s days were numbered there was to be no relaxation in missionary efforts however and we are fortunate
 that father andré 0:andre and father lestanc wrote accounts of them to father lacombe some experiences were not without risk in
 augimst 1879 there was a large gathering at sounding lake whem e it had beemi agreed that the plains cree
 would receive their treaty paymnemits there was plenty of work for the priests to do and in addition to the
 indians there were many métis 0:metis and amnericami traders the priests were well taken care of by these people and omi
 at least one occasion they were invited to dinner by the lieutemiamit governor this gathering lasted about a week amid
 when it dispersed lestammc amid fafard parted compamly lestamic went to work with indiamis imi the neutral hills area fafard
 followed a hand of lmidians who were going to go to the red deer river and had the good luck
 to meet father constamitimie scollemi amid father leomi doucet at the blackfoot treaty paymiiemits when the timiie camiie to returmi

 to be seeded or harvested in the several acres which fafard had succeeded in preparing for crops getting a supply
 of hay was a problem too 6 father lestanc has written of an unusually rainy season which left under water
 the sloughs and flats where the people of the mission made hay for their livestock father fafard and brother boone
 did other work while watching for a spell of good haying weather at a certain point they could wait no
 longer fafard sharpened his scythe and waded into the shallow water cutting the tall slough grass as he walked behind
 him caine brother boone whose job was to stoop and gather up armnfuls of the grass and carry it to
 higher ground miearby where it could cure in the sumi laid out imi very thin rows since fafam d could
 cut the tall slough grass faster than boomie could carry it to dry ground fafard had to stop mowing repeatedly
 and help carry the grass this work went on for five weeks but at the end of that timne the
 mission could look forward to winter with confidence that they could feed their cattle 7 details of the operation of
 the mission in the early 1880 s are difficult to fimid the evidence seems to suggest that for a time
 fafard was sent to cold lake to found a missiomi there v it appears too that the a location was
 chosen and to use lestanc s words everyone became a carpenter even factor mckay lent a hand before many weeks
 had passed they had built a rude log building thirty feet long by seventeen feet wide all went well during
 the first three days the next morning they woke up to find themselves stranded during a cold and stormy night
 the mare had given in to the temptation to return to the red deem river where the young indian had
 bought her the two men set out in opposite directions over the featureless landscape to find the mare fafard thought
 that they had no choice but to do this the fall season was fast approaching and there were many tasks
 awaiting him at the mission but there was no trace of blonde anywhere and fafard returned to the tent empty
 handed and dejected the young indian for his part was fortunate enough to find a small encampment of crees and
 had decided to stay overnight with them fafard was alone and had no way of knowing the fate of his
 companion since the weather was threatenimig he set to work to collect buffalo chips using themn to reinforce his tent
 on the inside in so doing he was both strengthening his termt and collecting fuel for his fire with these
 preparations made he said his prayers and went to sleep the next mnorning the young indian returned riding a horse
 he had borrowed from someone in the cree encampment the two men then broke camp loaded the buffalo chips on
 the cart and headed for the encampmemit where they spent several days while there fafard hearmied that lestanc was in
 a camp not far away and the two priests were reunited imi the neighbourhood of montagne du nez or nose
 hill from there the two priests were able to mnake their way without incident north across the ribstone flats amid
 the battle river back to the shelter of st jean framiçois 0:framicois regis at fort pitt the work of the mnission
 had suffered fromn fafard s absence and he now set to work to miiake preparations for winter there was always

 in this matter one thing quite large i understand while the i did not feel it nearly as cold as
 the blackfeet are far south the mountain last winter i was in ontario and this stoneys at bow rivem are
 a very fine winter so far is milder still horses stay tribe i am told mr mcdougall did not out
 without shelter and some have to visit us on his way up nor have we seen find most of their
 own living picking the any of the last summer s party yet grass from under the snow the snow is
 not more than a foot deep on the level i spent misy two vacations four weeks in mr steinhauer has

 over delighted with the appearance of all the on the 15 th of november this year and three places so
 far as natural scenery is concerned but there is not much beyond i never saw more dutiful and last but
 it does not usually freeze until the stockade enclosure except our two about this time barley sowed on the churches

 victoria the buildings use on the 28 th of august potatoes within the forts are all log and by no
 have been here now more than a planted 20 th may were fit for use in july means neatly furnished
 while outside are the houses of the settlers with their year and have never heard the the population of this

 large frame house two stories and membership and 50 scholars attending double verandah nicely painted and addressed to either father
 or our day school we have them divided partially finished in canadian style you into four classes the most advanced
 may think it silly but i don t think my mother read in the third book though we tears were
 very far off when i sat down in their parlour last sunimer for the first lacked very much that was
 necessary for time to see once more pictures a school work during the year yet it was a melodeon carpet
 book case and a matter of thankfulness that we had some veritable sofa i assure you was almost appliances during
 the whole of the year too niuch for me you must not infer i had to write and print with
 pen and ink though that we are barbarians in our all the reading matter used by three style of living
 mr steinhaur s house is fourths of my scholars this was quite a large and comisfortable very hike a plain

 remember that every board of alberta history autumn 1998 recent comniunication to him concerning the coming treaty they are also
 a very inquisitive people as well as anxious to receive spiritual instruction one after another is coming in from the
 plains and settling down among us renouncing gradually their heathen superstitions as the true light finds an entrance into their
 dark minds one old man from away down near carlton came in some months ago he seems to be very
 intelligent for a heathen is sincerely striving to read the cree upper left bible and is constantly making enquiries of
 mr s teinhauer and others the rev henry bird stein matter concerning the christian religion i am wa v an
 ojihwa indian who was very hopeful of his conversion trained for the methodist missions and arrived in alberta in 1855
 i have received this week into my school two little unbaptized heathens ab whose father has just arrived here i
 feel ove the lord is verily with us and crowning one oft me highlights of elizabeth our feeble efforts with
 success i cannot barrett s visit to fort edmonton in tell you how thankful i am that they have 1875
 was a stay at richard received me so kindly and give such hardi vtv ‘ s ‘ big house at
 that earnest heed to what i say i felt it to be time time largest structure on the one of
 the most difficult things to wimi pm nines their confidence 1 possess a little of it amid i think it
 is daily increasing i must now conclude at once as i have an unexpected chance of sending my letters to
 victoria perhaps i may not have another for two months lumber of his is sawn by hand and costs twenty
 five cents though only ten feet long and six inches wide you will see that building is costly work plain
 though it be nails are fifty cents a poumid salt and sugar the same amid a pound of rope costs
 fifty cents in fact everything imiiported except tea is extremely dear all home pmoduce amid manufacturers are quite reasonable considering
 the labor expended a good beaver skin is only worth 1 50 buffalo skin 1 50 a moose skin the
 best kind of leather 3 75 coats pants and evemi dresses for the summer are manufactured oumt of soft moose
 skin and very warm and comfortable it seems to be in fact the hide of the buffalo and moose is
 utilized in a hundred different ways i can sew quite nicely with buffalo sinew while from the finest cord to
 the large rope sustaining the weight of our church bell all are made from skin many are obliged to make
 it into fine parchment to glaze their windows with for want of glass while snowshoes chair bottoms carrioles sleighs bags
 mattresses amid coverlet for beds etc are produced from the sanie useful article i find it absolutely necessary for either
 minister or teacher here to be able to speak the cree language the people love and cling to their mother
 tongue and are not likely to soon permit the english to take its place several who understand emiglish will not
 speak a word of it if they can possibly avoid doing so while on the other hand they are perfectly
 delighted to hear me speaking cree there seems to he implanted deep in the indian nature a quiet though stubborn
 and most persistent determination to retain their own habits and customs in politics when they have any the crees are
 extremely conservative they are peaceable kind and sociable and by no means so warlike as some other tribes they say
 here white man s blood was never shed by a cree a fact of which our chief reminded the governor
 in a alberta history autumn 1998 letter from miss e a barrett dated a kind sociable warm hearted race white
 fish lake saskatchewan no doubt the direct result of christianity yj january 7 th 1876 proved by the contrast between
 the j miserable degraded pagan roaming the 41 my home surroundings are the best plains and the converted christiami cree
 j that can be expected under the of our mission circumstances mr steinhauer has indeed an amiable and god fearing
 family i never saw more dutiful and letter from lizzie a barrett respectful sons and daughters i have canadian methodist
 mission house been here now more than a year and white fish lake saskatchewan have never heard the first word
 of march 21 1877 disrespect addressed to either father or miiother they rule firmly but it is by love my
 dear young friends and not by fear they have never used the rod mrs steinhauer is in truth an i

 the east shore of few garden tools or farming implements the lake which is surrounded by hills on of any
 kind so when spring comes it is every side so that we cannot see very far no wonder that some

 strange to you little ontario girls they and so they hope and so they dream rise early in the morning
 and are soon and yet over and over again they come ready for work breakfast with most home from their
 hunting expeditions consists simply of boiled fish and literally starving to be a burden on their potatoes with a little
 parched barley no more industrious and energetic friends salt no pepper no butter and no bread who in spite of
 difficulties and either very often sugarless tea made of discouragements have stayed at home a kind of herb that grows
 here which and have succeeded in raising enough they seem to be fond of but which i would call a
 miserable weed almost as not only for themselves but for these above bad as my grandmother s horehound poor wanderers

 to buy a little real tea and sugar have a meal left it is cheerfully divided canada in 876 indicating
 that but many of our people seldom ever taste with those more needy than themselves elizabeth ban cit was a
 it and yet they are far more thankful and contented than many white people contributor whose tables are loaded with
 luxuries in place of apples nuts candies c our little folks feast themselves and their and dainties sonic of my
 poor little friends with bits of raw potato or turnip scholars sometimes have nothing to eat but a few roasted
 potatoes and very or a handful of barley and fortunate thankful indeed they are if they can indeed is the
 child who can triumphantly only get enough to satisfy their hunger display a flat barley cake to his or her
 sometimes they have to come to school little neighbours on arriving at school 0 hungry but i wish some greedy
 little white boys and girls could see the little bits and 0 how often my heart has ached for crumbs
 that are given round these little unfortunate ones they are not to blame though neither are their dinner and supper
 are much the same as parents you see they are not like your breakfast only that some kind of meat
 fathers and mothers who were taught such as moose buffalo or rabbit takes how to work and had proper utensils
 to the place of fish when they have it work with and have often seen almost those that stay at
 the village during every kind of work being done but these summer and hunt within say five or ten people
 seldom ever see any one work miles round home during winter are except themselves and they have only a able
 to live much better that those who alberta history autumn 1998 go to the plains if all the people that
 dressed hair and clean skins belong to our village could be persuaded i wish you could see the babies there
 to settle down and work they would they are just like fat roly pohies literally soon be well off and
 able to purchase a packed in moss and laced from toes to goodly share of all the luxuries that find
 chin as closely as your foot is laced into their way to these far off western stores your boot unable
 to stir hand or foot or do anything but shake their little heads as it is they are steadily improving
 and cry and so they remain for hours every year the children look cleaner togethem if they should cry when
 their our village is built on the east and whiter and better dressed this winter mothers are too busy to
 attend to them than i have yet seen them but i am sadly they are placed in a swing cradle
 and shore of the lake all the afraid if you were to peep over my the harder they cry the
 harder they are shoulder some mormiings and look down swung until at last the violent shaking houses are of log
 and each has a over the rows of old women like little suppose gives their little aching limbs girls with
 their plain straight waisted some relief and they fall asleep i know dresses buttoned up in front and one thing
 if ever i have a little baby field larger or smaller attached i have my mind made up about the
 reaching nearly to the floor you would indulge in a hearty laugh at their mossbag in which is raised barley
 expense and then no doubt you would turn a reproachful glance of inquiry and yet cruel as it seems i
 verily potatoes and turnips nearly believe many of these poor little babies upon me as much as to say can
 it be would freeze to death in the winter time possible you have been here two years every family has
 also one or and more and yet not have taught them if it were not for the warm cosy little
 nest they find in the moss bag how to make their dresses more horses oxen and cows especially when the
 mother has to take her baby on her back and her axe in her i pray you don t condemn
 me too soon hand and go to the woods to cut a load you must know the most aristocratic of
 wood when she gets there she builds mother or grandmother here has never a fire makes a little bed with
 a blanket seen anything better and even if they and some branches puts the baby into it had it would
 take them a very long time and goes to work the same in summer to make up their minds to
 accept any when she goes to the fields to cut or new fashions as better than the venerable thrash barley
 or dig potatoes the baby ones brought over by good mrs as usual is in its moss bag and has
 only steinhaur from norway house hudson to be laid down iii a shady place bay territory twenty years ago although
 i have been here so long i have you are no doubt surprised to hear of never been able to
 persuade any of them women doing such work but here they to get their clothes made like mine they labour
 equally with the men at almost imagine they would look supremely every kind of employment they are ridiculous in our
 costumes obliged to there is not a house in the village but the men are away sometimes as it is
 i am very thankful to see them for weeks together both summer and in dressed as well as they are
 i assure you winter perhaps hunting or it may be it is a grand improvement on the dirty taking their
 grists to mill or going to the sleeveless bag with two holes left at the fort for supplies either of
 which is fifty top for the arms and a bigger one for the miles distant so while they are absent
 head which with a dirty strip of white the women have to take the snow shoes blanket about the colour
 of a wasp s and travel from one to three miles nest only sometimes a shade or two setting snares
 or visiting snares already darker constituted the entire dress of set for rabbits and lynx many of my scholars when
 i first came here no wonder their little old they also have nets set in the lake under fashioned dresses
 look beautiful to me the ice for fish which must be visited now especially when set off by neatly daily
 and taken up washed dried and alberta history autumn 1998 mended once or twice a week then they regularly too
 have all the wood to get and if they have yesterday as the warm spring weather horses or cattle they
 must bring home has come i turned my schoolroom into a hay from the stacks two or three miles barber
 shop and with my scissors made distant you may think after all this a general raid on the superfluous hair
 at outdoor work is attended to they would least so far as i dared for here both men not have
 much time for indoor work but and boys delight in long hair and as a they find time nevertheless to
 make rule abominate the fashion of the their own and children clothes whites including shoes and stockings for the entire
 family the men buy their coats i must tell you also that there is pants and shirts ready made something
 else which is almost as distasteful to them as this especially the moccasins am e made of buffalo or moose
 renounced paganism and that is our i suppose you know their shoes or older ones and those who have lately
 skim and their stockings are simply old good old english habit of cleanliness fashioned pantalets made of blue cloth loud
 and strong in their protest and often heavily embroidered around the bottom with beads the men s fire generally against
 each fresh innovation always though when my ears are at a pouches as well as their leggings are safe distance
 when thus having often worked with beads also in various relieved themselves they are more than patterns and when i
 tell you that these half i eady to turn round and submit with same mothers and their grown up daughters
 have to dress and tan all the a good grace therefore seeing as i moose and buffalo hides which are
 quite heartily detest dirtiness as well as made not only into shoes which last every fashion that encourages it i
 very perhaps a mouth or less leggings fire quietly but very firmly set my foot bags etc but also into
 coats travelling down and say all the little boys and bags tents ticks for feather beds and girls who come
 to my school must allow carioles winter sleighs you will think themselves to be made clean and neat with nra
 i am sure that these women at if they do not thus come the necessary least earn their living articles
 are provided and they must perform their toilet there now this is the 21 st of march and spring is
