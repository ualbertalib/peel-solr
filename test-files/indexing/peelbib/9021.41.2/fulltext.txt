 warning other than apricots and of course the ubiquitous a vast and rapid build tip of sullen grey prune invariably
 all this would be bought clouds in the north and within minutes of this the first icy blast of wind
 struck us and listen to the booming of the ice on almost instantly the world about us was the lake
 as it split and buckled from the obliterated by driving snow my brother intense cold and the shotgun like crack
 and i were in the barn milking our cows of trees splitting open in the woods at the time and
 it was only a well dev it was on such nights that we would hear eloped sense of direction that
 took us the coyotes howling first one coyote safely back to the house once there would commence a solitary yapping
 we piled more wood on the stoves and then another and another and finally listened to the roar of the
 wind frequent from all points of the compass would trips to one of the windows outside of come an unearthly
 chorus of howls that which hung the thermometer showed rose and fell with a spine chilling effect the mercury dropping

 owls but a light snow was still falling blan life settled down to a daily routine of keting the entire
 countryside the roads performing the farm chores and haulwere completely drifted in cutting us off ing water from the well
 and wood from from our neighbours to the south the woodpile the struggle for survival had begun two days later
 the snow ceased but the temperature continued to drop finally in time my brother and i each whittled touching the
 sixty below mark it was out a pair of skis from boards and by means then with not a breath
 of air stirring of these we were able to travel over the that we clearly heard our neighbours deep snow
 it was then we established talking over a mile away and the ring of our first trapline on the lake
 under the an axe as they split stove wood once we experienced eye of stan hickman our even heard the
 thin wail of a train whistle nei ghbour s son he showed us how to set which we knew could
 only come from the traps first chopping a hole in the onoway fifteen miles away at night muskrat houses then
 setting the traps in from then on we would lie in our beds the runways just below water level so
 that the muskrats would quickly drown when caught we followed the same below procedure with the air holes on the
 ice ‘ night afler night said the author when where they came up to breathe when curled up in our
 beds we would listen to the swimming under water flights of wild geese passing overhead on their long journey southwards
 cailes never every morning from then on weather killeda canada goose permitting we would make our rounds removing the dead
 muskrats and re setting the traps back at home we would skin the carcasses scrape off every vestige of fat
 and then fir the skins on whittled out d ry ing boards one day when nearing the end of the
 trapline we were surprised by a sudden blizzard which forced us to take refuge in a thick stand of first
 growth spruce not knowing how long it would last we lit a j roaring bonfire and prepared for the worst
 we were well protected from the wind so began a war of attrition that lasted several days every time we
 found the v ‘ i stranger s traps we would not only rob i i 1 them but leave them
 unset further we i v ourselves wrote a warning message in v ‘ the snow but what we said i
 have long forgotten however it had the desired a effect and the lake once again became v ours but during
 the days of this cold i war we were constantly on the alert believing that our every move was being
 v watched most likely from a long aban v ‘ doned log cabin concealed in the trees ‘ on the
 far side of the lake a subsequent ‘ investigation however showed us to be 4 i quite wrong there were
 no signs of recent human occupancy and the only v ‘ e ‘ tning we rouna tnere was an omo
 case of dynamite which we tried to explode with rifle fire after putting it well out but of immediate concern
 was the matter on the ice in attempting this we were of food i have never seen a problem sol
 unsuccessful and presumably the dynaved so quickly stan happened to look up mite sank to the bottom of the lake

 in the marshes away where everyone was expected to the red winged blackbirds sounded their contribute not only to the
 food but to the o ke ree o ke ree as they hovered over entertainment as well i can still
 remember the tangled masses of last year s cattails my mother playing the accompaniment and bullrushes and once again the
 larvae for every song that was sung by those of mosquitoes hatched to continue their with courage enough to contribute
 their eternal plaguing of earth s warm blooded talents my father exhausted his reper mammals in the field the purple

 fences the wild rose flamed into colour bet the trilling efforts of a woman called the shackles of winter were
 broken and the countess who sang titwillow the earth breathed and became aliye again from the mikado i realize now
 that this get together was a gathering of and then came summer and with it the ifr lonely people but
 to me and no doubt back breaking task of clearing the land to the other boys there it was something
 day after day we would sally forth with to be endured our axes and chop and hew down the trees
 until exhaustion overtook us by august and so the long winter passed without we had cleared approximately an acre any
 further excitement except that leaving three hundred and nineteen to go the house neatly burned down from an overheated stovepipe
 on the day this it was at this juncture that my father and happened my father and i had driven
 with mother decided we needed a holiday and alberta history spring 1993 plans were accordingly made to go to lac
 ste anne some twenty miles away to see the historic mission founded by the reverend jean thibault in 1842 and
 which later became the home of the much revered father lacombe the towers undertook to look after the livestock and
 also lent us a tent to live in while we were at the lake in due course we were on
 our way with the team and wagon but we had scarcely gone ten miles when disaster overtook us we were
 proceeding down a rough road lined with tall poplar trees when a wind storm hit us of such proportions that
 the trees began to fall like nine pins across the road in front of us the team panicked and it
 was only with the greatest shot heavy rifle we owned and rode up difficulty that my father brought them the
 hill in search of the bear but by the under control somehow he managed to time i arrived at the
 berry patch the bear turn the wagon around and the team g al had left the country which was probably
 loped out of danger that was the end of just as well for me the holiday still shaking we pulled
 into a we had one other visit from a bear this homestead that we had passed and waited time it
 clambered over the log railings out the storm the kindly homesteaders around the pig stye and attempted to filling us
 up with bacon and eggs and strong make a meal of a choice fat pig the most black coffee it
 was back to the farm for us terrific din arose the squealing and grunt when berry picking time came we
 turned ing of the pigs and the crashing of logs as our attentions to laying in a winter s supply
 they tried to force their way out of the of fruit and it was while my mother and pen my
 father ran down and was just in brother were picking raspberries on a hill rime to see the bear clamber
 out and disto the south of the farm that she came appear into the bush fortunately little face to face
 with a black bear who was damage was done and again i attempted to the more surprised it is difficult
 to say follow the bear but with no success she or the bear let it suffice to say that it
 was after this last episode that i think she dropped the pail she was carrying and my parents began to
 take a second look together with my brother ran all the way at the future life certainly was proving home
 when she was able to gasp our to be a continual struggle for survival a what had happened i grabbed
 the single type of life for which they were both temperamentally unsuited as were most us our own version of

 of how to wrest a living from iably it was they who broke first the the soil under the harshest
 of conditions men by and large were more adaptable and so in 1921 there occurred yet anbut the women found
 the isolation and other auction sale which left my father consequent lack of female companionship with a handful of promissory

 owned a large modern house with central hearing v indoor plumbing and hardwood floors v amenities that had never been
 seen before v in the district they were definitely nor roughing it mr hinchcliffe even owned an inboard motor boat
 of great interest to my brother and me was the fact that there were four girls in the family for
 one of whom i developed a severe case of calf love unfortunately she loved another who lived at the end
 of the lake but visits to their home were always a v pleasure especially the one christmas we iuui spent
 with them on this occasion we drove through the intense cold in our bobsleigh our sleighbells jingling merrily ‘ i
