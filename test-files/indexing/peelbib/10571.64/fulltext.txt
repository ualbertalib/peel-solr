 cd jp dl message from the colonel in chief the year 2001 was an extraordinary year for the regiment and 
 indeed for the world in a year highlighted by incredible events throughout the globe patricias have continued 0:contin 0:ued to 
 perform in a highly professional manner whether they were deployed on operations on training or in garrison routine i have 
 been most fortunate to have had the opportunity to visit at least one of the battalions during the past year 
 it was indeed a rare occurrence that i was able to visit one of the battalions twice during the year 
 but was unable to visit the other two units it was a great experience to travel to bosnia once again 
 this time with my daughter amanda to visit the second battalion during their tour i was once more deeply impressed 
 by the efforts and professionalism 0:pro 0:fessionalism of the patricia soldiers as they continue to do stalwart service in this 
 region of the world the benefit of their presence is clearly evident my second visit with the second battalion was 
 in winnipeg in july for the celebration 0:celebra 0:tion of the 50th anniversary of the battle of kap yong it 
 was a great delight to participate in the various ceremonies and also to meet such a large amount of the 
 patricia family it was inspiring to see so many of the kap yong veterans and i felt greatly honoured to 
 be the reviewing officer during the trooping the colours and to watch the old guard march past i am very 
 impressed with the popularity and success of the recently published regimental history written by david bercuson the regiment has a 
 fascinating heritage that should be promoted as much as possible this best selling book whose publication was made possible by 
 many dedicated volunteers will go a long way to enhancing the regiment s image and identity at the close of 
 the year i waited with great expectation for the deployment of the third battalion to afghanistan i was confident in 
 their professionalism and dedication and shared their motivation to begin the mission i was also happy that the soldiers were 
 able to spend christmas with their families and begin deployment in the new year i am sure that the battalion 
 will serve with great distinction the upcoming year will provide many challenges and opportunities for the regiment the third battalion 
 should complete its mission in afghanistan and by that time the first battalion should be in its final preparation stage 
 for its deployment to bosnia i look forward 0:for 0:ward to my visit to canada in march when i will 
 have the opportunity to visit the first battalion and the rear party of the third battalion as well as the 
 association branches in victoria calgary and edmonton i am confident that patricias everywhere will meet all challenges in the year 
 with the skill dedication and pride that sets them at the top of their profession 
 3 the patrician 2001 vp colonel of the regiment princess patricia s canadian light infantry general a j g d 
 de chastelain pc cmm cd ch message from the colonel of the regiment 2001 has been an event filled year 
 for the regiment starting with the return of the second battalion from operations in bosnia continuing with the celebrations of 
 the 50th anniversary of the battle of kap yong in winnipeg mid year and culminating with the deployment 0:deploy 0:ment 
 of the third battalion for operations in afghanistan the chilling events of the terrorist attacks on the united states in 
 september have overshadowed many of the other events of the year and provided a spill over effect on the canadian 
 forces and on the regiment the run down of the forces in the post cold war period 0:peri 0:od has 
 now been placed in question by the spectre of world wide terrorism and a large majority 0:majori 0:ty of the 
 canadian public has recently endorsed an increase in canadian defence capability how that will translate into policy remains to be 
 seen but the retention of the third battalions of each of the regular force infantry regiments earlier in question now 
 seems assured the celebration of the kap yong anniversary in winnipeg was a stirring event with the return to that 
 city of many ppcli korean war veterans including many of the veterans of the kap yong battle the colonel in 
 chief was present throughout the four day celebration and took the opportunity there to launch the new bercuson history of 
 the ppcli signing numerous copies for the patricias their families and their friends the history is a best seller and 
 has gone into a second printing the organization of such an outstanding weekend was made possible 0:pos 0:sible only by 
 the hard work of the winnipeg branch of the association and the members of the second battalion all who attended 
 enjoyed the camaraderie and benefited by the chance to meet old friends again winnipeg was also in the regiment s 
 focus this year when it was confirmed that the second battalion will move from kap yong barracks to cfb shilo 
 in 2004 that event will bring to an end a continuous thirty two year association of the regiment with winnipeg 
 a period 0:peri 0:od longer even than the association which existed between the two world wars it was the fall 
 out of the september 11th terrorist attack that caused third battalion to be alerted trained and equipped for operations in 
 afghanistan despite the on again offagain 0:on 0:again 0:off 0:again nature of the final order to deploy which placed a 
 strain on soldiers and their families over the christmas period advance parties left before the end of the year with 
 the aim of having the battle group on the ground in afghanistan early in the new year we in the 
 regiment are pleased that third battalion has been chosen for this important task and we wish all members of the 
 battle group success in their operations and a safe return with the third battalion there and with first battalion preparing 
 for another tour in bosnia next year 2002 promises to be another eventful chapter in our history my best wishes 
 to all of you at home and abroad and to your families

 to work with the leopard c 2 in a combined arms context as a combat team we quickly proved our 
 ability to form into the combat team and execute operations in a warfighting scenario exercise mobile ram enabled the company 
 to conduct live fire training up to and including platoon level the platoon live fire range involved both lav ills 
 in the firebase and on the assault 
 the patrician 2001 21 vp this demonstrated an excellent challenge for the soldiers and leaders alike for the first time 
 all the weapons systems were employed together in a live fire setting further training completed by a company was a 
 night level combined arms attack this attack which was highly successful involved the tanks in the firebase and the lav

 operations the culmination of the exercise involved a combat team trace with live fire artillery and engineer support this trace 
 was challenging and it provided the foothold for the upcoming spring exercise robust ram the tempo was quick this year 
 and a company learned many valuable lessons both the individual and unit level training completed to date has placed a

 s in the firebase and on the assault was an excellent 0:excel 0:lent challenge for soldiers and leaders alike for 
 the first time all the weapons systems were working together unfortunately the remainder of the exercise was dry due to 
 the lack of safety staff however the final combat team objective had the engineers conducting live breaches and the guns 
 from 1 rcha firing live on the position before our assault luckily the only no duff casualty was pte brownell 
 who suffered a small laceration to his face after assaulting a figure 11 target with his head the tempo was 
 quick this year but charlie company learned a number of lessons both the individual and unit training completed to date

 i vp combat support company a year in review this year proved to be both interesting and difficult for the 
 members 0:mem 0:bers of combat support company the year started off with the company preparing for ex urban ram where 
 the different platoons were employed in a myriad of positions next up were exs valid ram and millennium warrior which 
 saw the efforts of the company being overshadowed by the implementation of the new lav 111 vehicles before anybody knew 
 it it was summer and time for the change of command parade which saw lcol c r king take over 
 command from lcol s brennan along with this the company saw some major changes within our own leadership major carr 
 took over command of the company with mwo kolotylo coming in as the csm numerous other commanders came into the 
 company as well as the new leadership were starting to get settled into their jobs the first of many shakeups 
 began including major carr going off to finish his course in kingston as always sigs platoon was kept extremely busy 
 with the continuing 0:con 0:tinuing implementation of the iris system both through the running of courses and the normal day 
 to day changes that seem to occur whenever 0:whenev 0:er a new piece of equipment is introduced throughout all of 
 this the members of the platoon were kept busy trying to train both the rest of the battalion and themselves 
 after the completion of ex mobile ram the platoon can now be considered experts on the iris system albeit there 
 is always something else to learn the eyes and ears of the battalion recce platoon were kept busy throughout the 
 year numerous training opportunities were used to enhance their skills including mounted and dismounted training the running 0:run 0:ning of 
 a basic recce and surveillance operator course the running of battalion ranges the various exercises and of course the never 
 ending taskings now that the year is almost up recce will soon have to shift gears and get ready to 
 deploy to bosnia next year as a rifle platoon it may be a hard pill to swallow but the soldiers 
 and leaders within the platoon 0:pla 0:toon will be able to do the job while keeping their hardcore abilities undercover 
 until the right time anti armour platoon tried to keep themselves in a defilade position 0:posi 0:tion however the positioning 
 didn t work quite as well as expected when the various tasks came into play throughout most of the year 
 the platoon 0:pla 0:toon acted in support of the battalion all of this changed during ex mobile ram when a 
 tow concentration was conducted anti armour platoon 0:pla 0:toon in conjunction with recce platoon engage enemy targets with tow missiles 
 and 25mm cannon fire the coordination of fire and target acquisition in a live fire scenario was challenging pioneer platoon 
 were able to keep both their skills and their beards in good shape as always they were used as the 
 workhorses of the battalion having to put their engineering abilities to good use during ex mobile ram the platoon had 
 the opportunity to work with 11 field 25 the patrician 2001 
 i vp squadron throughout their training while they proved their abilities to the engineers they also demonstrated their unique style 
 and flare which the engineers will never be able to match mortar platoon as with the rest of the company 
 was inundated with taskings including their potential deployment with 3 ppcli as part of the irf l the platoon was 
 stood down from this task just prior to christmas throughout the year they were allowed several opportunities 0:opportuni 0:ties to 
 practice their skills and drop bombs down range thanks to a conscientious effort and a bit of luck the platoon 
 was able to complete their dag process and become the first members of 1 ppcli to don the new relish 
 cam combats all in all it has been an interesting year within combat support company a great deal was accomplished 
 throughout all of the exercises 0:exercis 0:es and all personnel were able to play a major role in the training

 company the 2001 training year has been a busy and diverse one for 1 ppcli administration company the company has 
 supported two large pcf cycles a battalion ski school and four major exercises what made this year different from the 
 previous ones was the incorporation of the lav 3 into the battalion this proved to be a major endeavor as 
 everyone 0:every 0:one had to learn the ropes when dealing with the new fighting vehicle transport platoon has had another 
 successful year the high point was experimenting with revised supply delivery doctrine on ex valid ram in the spring instead 
 of having transport platoon responsible 0:responsi 0:ble to deliver supplies to each of the companies in the field typically a 
 company rolling replenishment they only delivered supplies to a beefedup 0:beefed 0:up company echelon this worked extremely well but it 
 is unlikely that the required vehicles for the companies will be available any time soon the ums has had many 
 changes to its organization over the past year the cf medical system is in its first phases of a major

 but should make out well in 2002 a warning to all visitors to 1 ppcli ums do not drink the 
 water there have been three recent additions to the ums staffs families with two more on the way for the 
 qm staff this year s main activity involved signing for 
 28 the patrician 2001 i vp two company s worth of lav 3 all coming with large bundles of unfamiliar 
 0:unfamil 0:iar new equipment it is hard to sign for a harmonic infusion device when you haven t seen one 
 before needless to say many hoops were jumped through in order to ensure that the rifle companies had the equipment 
 0:equip 0:ment they needed to get their training done the qm staff also had to adapt to a new supply 
 system the cfssu this computerized supply system has had a few hiccups over the past few months and has proven 
 to be a bigger learning curve than expected maintenance platoon has had its hands full keeping up with the pace 
 of activity throughout 2001 between inspecting new vehicles routine 0:rou 0:tine inspections vehicle upgrade projects mlvw wheel rim replacements and 
 of course fixing all of the vehicles that get broken over the course of training the pace has been relentless 
 the biggest challenge with coping with the lav 3 was trying to find enough parts to keep them running to 
 keep both a and c companies at maximum strength on ex mobile ram it took the combined efforts of supply 
 staff canada wide we had every last transorb and differential in canada shipped to cfb suffield looking to the future 
 2002 will be another challenging year a pcf cycle ex robust ram and then preparations for the likely op palladium

 in june running concurrently 0:con 0:currently with preparations for the 50th anniversary of the battle of kap yong it was 
 probably beneficial in the end because capt chorely was not required to do drill after block leave combat support company 
 was dissected in order to support a number of tasks across the country it was a sad day in the 
 company when capt vivian aka young buffalo departed the city limits for the maritimes combat support personnel performed extremely well 
 on the advance courses sgt sargent topped advance pioneer mcpl orr topped advanced recce and capt j t williams topped 
 advanced anti armour and despite having a mortar platoon without mortars capt vivian and his band of merry men were 
 able to conduct some outstanding mortar training in support of the advance mortar course the lav cadre became a satellite

 of vehicle from golf cart to bren gun carrier driven by mcpl lavoie the kitchen provided some excellent feeding while

 contingent to actually stand at the site where lcol jim r stone led his battalion of patricias to victory over 
 the advancing chinese hordes is overwhelming to view the ground where capt mills had called friendly artillery down on his

 and finally absorb engineer armoured logistic and artillery personnel to form a battle group for the campaign against terrorism not 
 to mention the on again offagain 0:off 0:again attachment of a rifle company from 2 ppcli and the debate over 
 whether or not the battalion s indirect fire would come from 1 ppcli s mortar platoon or from the guns 
 challenging training started with a validation 0:vali 0:dation exercise prior to assuming the task of immediate reaction force light continued 
 on through a month of urban combat training where the battalion s soldiers shone and culminated with a series of

 did the regiment proud everywhere they went the details can be read in each company s article suffice it to 
 say that on all occasions we left our hosts or guests with a very favorable impression of the canadian army 
 the qualities of the junior non commissioned officer which we often take for granted usually made the biggest impression on 
 foreign contingents while the regiment often prides itself on initiative and professionalism from the lowest 0:low 0:est rank upwards sometimes

 to be allowed to command 0:com 0:mand these fine men and women the training year is also summarized in the

 that i feel will serve us well in the future from the chaos of a combat team clearance of a

 teams are in rebuilding years some mention must be given to the officers continuing domination of the senior ncos in 
 the annual christmas hockey game and while our hats go off to the first battalion s accomplishments at the queen

 basically started from scratch

 been a case of flexibility first the mission changed from peacekeeping in kabul to war fighting in kandahar notice to 
 move changed from 48 hours to seven days and back to 72 hours attachments changed continually 1 ppcli s mortar 
 platoon was lent to us and taken away the gunners of 1 rcha were to provide some civil military cooperation 
 troops and now are manning a mortar platoon the ldsh were on stand by to provide a reconnaissance squadron of 
 coyote vehicles which at the time of writing has been attached to the battle group the engineers have faced many 
 changes to the element they are to provide us finally the logistical tail has been adjusted on a weekly basis 
 despite these constant changes the hard and realistic training conducted throughout the year has kept the infantry soldiers focused on 
 their role and to that end they have continued to hone their skills all ranks are looking forward to this 
 unique mission which will be summarized in next year s patrician all the way a company sgt ford cpl gladue

 however with the coming of march a para company composite platoon had the opportunity to deploy to fort benning georgia 
 to assist dciem with their nvg trials in urban and rural environments this allowed us the opportunity to play with

 on saturday september 1 the british soldiers of d company kcr arrived and were met by familiar english weather the 
 kcr departed edmonton for the canmore region on sunday many suffering from jet lag or so they claimed the drive 
 to the canmore region allowed the brits to catch up on some needed sleep but also was a scenic introduction 
 to the following week upon arrival at base camp the members of kcr were greeted by b company personnel who 
 deployed earlier for a basic mountain operations course in preparation for the exchange after a quick supper the troops were 
 issued with everything they would need to complete the training two carabiners and one sash cord which they would acquaint 
 themselves with exceedingly well over the upcoming week the first activity was the knot lessons where they learned the basic 
 knots that would be needed during training the finale for the first evening was the donning of the swiss seats 
 many didn t understand why they should tie the harnesses so tight some found out the hard way while other 
 learned from their friends mistakes up the mountain each morning prior to commencement of the day s training all personnel 
 headed out on a mountain hike this consisted of climbing mount yamniska using various routes each day after the first 
 morning and being acclimatized to the rocky mountains many were not looking forward 0:for 0:ward to hiking the elevator seeing 
 that the scenic trek was difficult enough some members of the kcr spent time in the brecon beacons with hopes 
 to prepare for the visit to canada but were still amazed by the size and majestic scene of the canadian 
 mountain region another day another swiss seat the following few days were spent learning about mountain operations skills and installations 
 the days were filled with activities that either had them ascending or descending a mountain face skills learned included top 
 roping instructed by mcpl coates and fixed line climbing instructed by sgt mcnabb mcpl gravel instructed the finer techniques of 
 rappelling with different equipment while sgt macgregor and sgt krejci covered the process of lowering casualties down rock faces installations 
 covered 
 the patrician 2001 57 11l vp included the vertical hauling line which allows equipment to be moved up to the 
 top of a climb 1 2 3 rope bridges and the suspension traverse better known as the death slide by 
 the kcr personnel although no one was hurt all training was characterized as being excellent although for each stand a 
 swiss seat was worn work hard play harder after the completion of the required training the members of the kcr 
 were ready for a little r r prior to the forthcoming tactical exercise the weekend started with a social night 
 out in canmore that allowed everyone to let their hair down especially mcpls gravel and coates the saturday was set 
 aside to visit lake louise and banff all enjoyed the time spent at the radium hot springs finally to cap 
 off the weekend the british troops were able to partake in some whitewater rafting and horseback riding 0:rid 0:ing if 
 it ain t raining it ain t training after the week of fun in the sun the rain and snow 
 came with the start of the tactical exercise in true patricia style the sight of snow in september almost put 
 many into shock troops from b company deployed to the training area in order to recce routes and setup mountain 
 installations to be used by the kcr during the exercise the following morning upon completion of battle procedure the kcr 
 deployed into the exercise area unfortunately due to the events in the united states the exercise was stopped and the 
 kcr didn t have the opportunity to use their new skills in a tactical situation although the exercise was cut 
 short numerous new skills were learned by the british troops and the ability to train with allied forces enhanced our 
 own experience 3 ppcli mountain operation instructors on this exercise included mwo scheidl wo gebhardt sgt mcnabb sgt krejci sgt 
 macgregor sgt harper mcpl coates and mcpl gravel the mois received many words of praise in regards to the excellent 
 training and excellent instruction

 company began 2001 by supporting b company s small unit exchange with the germans some lucky members 0:mem 0:bers flew 
 to germany to participate in the winter ski school at mittenwald in bavaria anti armour platoon deployed up to haines 
 junction yukon in place of b company s third platoon which was in germany as well unfortunately they had to 
 spend 3 grueling days in a bus as the air force missed their first chock sleeping in schools and relaxing 
 in local legions the soldiers were quite happy to finally leave the close warm stuffy confines of their transport while 
 many tow gunners 0:gun 0:ners had participated in previous sovereignty exercises the inter platoon force on force exercise gave them 
 a chance to show the rifle company how it s done while there was some debate on the effectiveness of 
 their attack on 5 platoon and possible cheating by said platoon tow remained strong in defence against both 4 and 
 5 platoon the deployment 0:deploy 0:ment was a challenge for signals platoon who established and maintained 0:main 0:tained a high 
 frequency link all the way back to edmonton only to see the company use cell phones the next exercise resolute 
 guard saw the various detachments of combat support tasked out to the rifle companies recce platoon enjoyed the fine weather 
 and tried out rented quads as a light recce vehicle the robust quad vehicles proved capable along cut lines and 
 tracks in the rocky mountain front ranges despite the cold the quads certainly looked cool which is what s really 
 important the recce screen effectively picked up enemy contacts for the companies and the tow dets using eryx for the 
 exercise had excellent definition using thermal sights in the cold weather the pioneers were blissfully unaware of all of this 
 as they were providing security and support to the 
 the patrician 2001 59 11l vp engineers at a bridge demolition guard while the river valley was cold the nearby 
 cafe allowed many pioneers to warm up with a fresh coffee and laugh at the frozen recce dets screaming through 
 on quads signals platoon spent their time cursing the battalion s infatuation with mountains and tried to keep the radio 
 net working and secure despite the best efforts of b company to name just one with wo armand off to 
 poland with b company again the rest of the company occupied themselves by practising skills and even helping c company 
 with an exercise parachute qualified soldiers from tow and recce maintained skills during casual parachuting opportunities the next major event 
 for the battalion was urban brave urban ram two exercises in city fighting lasting over three weeks many combat support 
 personnel were used as referees for the entire brigade and captain clark was able to use the miles god gun 
 to get revenge for the impending loss of his beloved mortar platoon this was a very long tasking 0:task 0:ing 
 for those individuals 5 weeks solid every day the exercise involved all units of the brigade as well as many 
 militia units taking part on weekends 0:week 0:ends tow and mortar platoon were amalgamated as a rifle platoon to help 
 with the under strength c company the pioneers spent some time working with the engineers working on breaching charge training 
 and booby trap refresher they then joined the rifle companies to support attacks by breaching obstacles including walls and clearing 
 threats such as booby trapped doors cooperation between pioneers and engineers from 1 combat engineer regiment was very good with 
 both sides teaching each other after urban ram combat support soldiers went off to various taskings for the summer many 
 members of tow platoon bolstered a company in their task of providing a company for the reserve dismounted company commander 
 s course this month long task saw tow primarily as the enemy force and happy that they didn t have 
 to put in attack after attack after attack during this period mortar platoon was effectively disbanded lack of personnel in 
 the battalion led to the removal of mortar positions and the subsequent dispersal of the mortarmen to the two amalgamated 
 rifle companies where possible these soldiers are employed in company 0:compa 0:ny weapons dets as mortarmen albeit with smaller mortars 
 with a view to keep their indirect fire skills fresh using 60mm mortar groups with bipods and sights while morale 
 has suffered it is hoped that eventually mortars will return to the 3rd battalion and these soldiers can be re 
 employed in mortars with minimal refresher training at the same time recce was busy running courses two basic recce courses 
 were run one for the reserves and one for battalion personnel 0:per 0:sonnel which then flew to trenton to support 
 the patrol pathfinder course as followers at the same time a pre pathfinder course was conducted and fourßecce soldiers flew 
 to trenton for the military freefall parachutist course 
 60 the patrician 2001 111 vp after the summer leave period combat support began adjusting to new personnel with major 
 campbell taking over the company and wo now mwo ror becoming csm new faces abounded captain latinovitch assumed command of 
 recce platoon and lt lowe moved into tow this last move was particularly welcome to wo armand who now could 
 send all the paperwork to someone who cared training picked up and then sept 11 happened a training exercise 0:exer 
 0:cise scheduled for ft lewis was moved to dundurn but this proved to be a positive move for tow and 
 recce platoons with tow dets bundled into and sometimes piled on to litis jeeps like so many gypsy caravans the 
 advantages of tow s thermal sights became clear tow and recce worked hand in hand to define and picket enemy 
 objectives for the rifle companies to attack by the end of the exercise this had become very slick on the 
 other hand pioneers were building targets for ambush ranges the bearded soldiers had some satisfaction weeks later when they participated 
 in mine clearing exercises and a demolitions range with the engineers this exercise was a vindication for signals platoon who 
 could show off the effectiveness of the new radios called tcccs in rela tively flat terrain this was the first 
 field exercise for the unit using the new radios which are the most sophisticated deployed by any army it s 
 best not to ask signals platoon why the new radios still weigh a ton as they have no sense of 
 humour about it since the middle of november combat support company has been waiting for the order to go to 
 afghanistan tow platoon is packed for bear recce is gearing up with night sights and signals platoon is asking itself 
 what the deal is with 3 ppcli and mountains anyway the signalers can get some enjoyment from the fact that 
 they no longer have to worry about establishing a radio link all the way along the spine of norway to 
 germany as a planned exercise there will likely be cancelled until we get the word combat support company like the

 vp french grey battalion combat training centre cfb gagetown there can be a few assumptions laid down about the patrician 
 submission from the french grey battalion every year first there was a tremendous amount of training completed throughout the year 
 young ocdts through to ql7 wos will walk through cfb gagetown gates with the aim of completing 0:com 0:pleting some 
 good army training sir some will come more willingly than others second this training could not have been successfully completed 
 0:com 0:pleted without the strong support and augmentation from the field force third the hunting and fishing in new brunswick 
 is pretty damn good but we all long for the northern lights of the prairies the good thing about being 
 posted to cfb gagetown is the fact that you constantly see fellow patricias with the coming of each new course 
 every few months it s like old home week as patricia s from the field force fill out the nominal 
 roles as either candidates or augmentee staff depending on the time of year those times corresponding to key regimental days 
 it s good to have patricia augmentation in gagetown many times this has meant the difference in a sr nco 
 officer broom i 100 game actually it hasn t meant anything because the officer team has lost for at least 
 the last five years straight in the end it doesn t matter because the jr ranks team always cleans house 
 it has been noted that the introduction of a few hayboxes of regimental moose milk on the sidelines 0:side 0:lines 
 throughout the afternoon could turn the tide in future games for exactly which team has yet to be determined but 
 it s good to see people are focusing on the priorities the french grey battalion had some notable officer and

 up with a four day urban operations training cycle in griesbach and in march a company formed part of an 
 ad hoc battalion for exercise cougar salvo at fort lewis washington the focus of cougar salvo was deliberate attacks on 
 the regensberg urban training area the exercise consisted of a battalion attack followed by five days of live firing and 
 concluded with an airmobile battalion attack on regensberg miles simulation equipment was used for the attacks and tactical aviation 0:avia

 when a pair of brothers ptes gerhardt and paul klann were selected for the cf biathalon team and were able 
 to spend the summer in germany training with the bundswehr team the regimental band continued to play at venues throughout

 early in the year some members of the regiment took part in the basic ski and advanced ski proficiency course 
 run in kananaskis country by the british not only did the soldiers learn the finer points of backcountry and alpine 
 skiing but they got to build and live in their own snow caves towards the end of winter several soldiers 
 got to take the new light over snow vehicle losv course that was run up in edmonton with the ldsh 
 rc cpl ken merritt from suffield was one of the instructors 0:instruc 0:tors on this course even though snow was 
 in short supply the qualification 0:qualifica 0:tion was obtained by all and as an additional treat we were able to 
 visit the regimental kit shop the hoof and mouth disease scare in europe directly effected suffield in a big way 
 during the training season along with their comrades 0:com 0:rades suffield patricias had to don protective gear and disinfect the 
 footwear of every single uk soldier who came over to train during the course of the entire year this included 
 all footwear from combat boots to stiletto pumps this added significantly to the support duties already assigned for the very 
 busy batus training season the 2001 batus training period was noted for being extremely dry this understandably led to frequent 
 range fires some of which were quite large then just when the british end of season range clean up was 
 concluding we had to gear up for the arrival of icmbg so much for down time still it was good 
 to see old friends and acquaintances from the regiment over the month of november the new lav ills looked particularly 
 good as well in particular we liked the fact that canadian units actually fight the fires they start a pleasant 
 change from the normal practice around here so thanks for that and good luck to the regiment in 2002

 are also very well represented in the school s weapons cell with sgt fullerton and mcpl ricard who arrived from 
 the 2nd battalion finally wo campbell in the standards cell ensures we get the latest changes and that we infact 
 implement them one of the major challenges faced by the staff at cflrs is the adoption of the virtual file 
 within the recruit division this novel idea of placing all the data weekly assessments scores inspection results and strong and 
 negative points of the recruits on a data base may be common 0:com 0:mon for some members of the senior 
 staff and other trades however we are infantrymen and for some the work is both challenging and frustrating especially when 
 you watch some person struggle with their computer then loose hours of work to somewhere in cyberspace the comdt also 
 had the pleasure of changing positions with the youngest staff member at the men s christmas dinner and it turned 
 out that mcpl killoran was our man the many challenges faced by all staff at cflrs are both rewarding and 
 challenging however we do have the unique opportunity to positively influence the future leaders of the canadian military this year 
 cflrs was pleased to have had col kenward general kennedy general nordic and col fraser as reviewing officers for the 
 graduates hopefully this trend will continue as it is a perfect opportunity for the senior officers of our regiment to 
 visit with the new officers and ncms of the cf and it also gives us a chance to find out 
 what is happening within the regiment finally there is one other patricia within the quebec area that we seem to 
 have lost contact with and that is capt wright on attached posting with 2 r22er capt wright please call home 
 however he may be in bosnia with the vandoo battle group that is all for this year we are expecting 
 another large influx of regular staff and augmentees for the upcoming training year and we hope to see some familiar 
 faces from out west

 unfamiliar with our clan we include as part of the ottawa area regimental family those who reside anywhere within about 
 a 2 hour drive kingston trenton montreal etc as the year 2001 dawned on your ottawa area patricias it was 
 a solemn time indeed we were just getting over the loss of lgen gord reay who passed away just before 
 christmas as a result of injuries sustained in a car accident in zagreb croatia when we lost another regimental icon 
 in february colonel bill suds sutherland left us in february but continues to monitor our regimental achievements from the vital 
 ground on high we take some consolation in the fact we are able to still enjoy the company 0:compa 0:ny 
 of lesley reay and helen sutherland and share a few fond memories of a time not so long ago so 
 what were we up to over the year well as is the case with any organization 0:organ 0:ization we lost 
 a few to postings remusters and retirement and gained a few as well those who managed to put ndhq in 
 their rear view mirrors included lcol king majs fitzgerald and kenneally capts dawe doucet and hisey cwos comeau williams woodley

 activities they were a few in number but strong in support and participation after all if you get together every 
 month you might be challenged to come up with something new to add to the conversation hey this is ottawa 
 our year is founded on just a handful of regimental gatherings regimental day a fall meet n greet a merit 
 board meet n greet and remembrance day as always our comrades in the association are key members of our family 
 and there s never a shortage of war stories when you have 50 years of time to draw upon the 
 highlights of our year included among other things putting together a massive 55th 
 vp 86 the patrician 2001 wedding anniversary card for our colonel in chief and trying to explain to the ndhq 
 senior leadership all about our regimental pastime on 17 mar broom i 100 when many soldiers get injured especially in 
 a deployed operation you have no idea how much excitement this creates here in ndhq i suppose in closing i 
 should attempt to address that horrible feeling you get when your career manager whispers in your ear hey i think 
 it s time i posted you to ottawa take it from any member of the regimental family already here you 
 won t regret it and yes chances are you ll get to go back to the sharp end soon enough 
 the quality of life in this area is hard to match with all of the summer and winter activities here 
 sneaking out of your office to catch a bit of the jazz festival going for a regimental skate along the 
 canal in the winter and a choice of innumerable 0:innumer 0:able routes for going for a run to check out 
 the scenery and look at it another way a posting here is not the kiss of death for your career 
 witness the many ottawa regimental members who are moving into command appointments this summer lcols mike day and mike beaudette 
 to take command of the 2nd and 3rd battalions respectively as well as cwo john mcgregor to take over as 
 1 brigade rsm so if you re coming to ottawa trust us you won t regret it why has my 
 patrician submission taken on the air of an ottawa recruiting drive ha in any event your ottawa area regimental family 
 notes with tremendous pride the accomplishments of our comrades at the sharp end keep it up stay healthy and hopefully 
 our paths will cross again soon

 battalion personnel on a brief parade at kap yong barracks where pte kristopher dukeshire treated us to an excellent reading 
 of the citation aware that most second battalion soldiers were on leave we were surprised by the number on parade

 104 the patrician 2001 to have you drop in fraser valley branch our branch year begins in the fall when 
 the majority of our members 0:mem 0:bers return from their summertime rambling about the country in some cases they go 
 all the way to the east coast and back which makes for some interesting stories when we all get together 
 again our first meeting this past fall was the first wednesday in september when a couple of couples were still 
 on the road by october s meeting we were back to normal with one notable exception adeal canfield wife of 
 the branch president had died on 29 september 2001 she died of throat cancer she was 69 years of age 
 and had been the wife of and a loyal patricia for over 48 years because of the progression of the 
 cancer adeal was unable to accompany her husband to the 50th anniversary of kap yong marked by the second battalion 
 in winnipeg in july for that she was deeply disappointed lady patricia took the time to write adeal a note 
 which greatly cheered her up the consideration of lady patricia in sending a note recognizing her absence from the celebra 
 
 the patrician 2001 105 tion did much to make adeal s last few weeks bearable for that and an additional 
 note she received from the countess just before she died we were both profoundly grateful november brought us our usual 
 parade and observance at the cenotaph of the former base we paraded with the borne west airborne contingent and the 
 korean veteran association contingent the weather was reasonably kind but the hot rums at the legion following the parade certainly 
 went down well in early december we had our annual christmas dinner at the restaurant which was very well attended 
 we picked up one newly retired member this year mark benjamin but with the loss of a member we remain

 108 the patrician 2001 the horiffic events of september 11th 2001 have in some ways bonded people together and made 
 us aware of neighbour s needs as our troops prepare for overseas duty we offer our support and remember them 
 and their families in our prayers and daily thoughts may god bless them and keep them the editor would like 
 to thank don gower for the following submissions princess patricia s canadian light infantry 1 comments relating to the ppcli 
 association 2 the action resulting in the unit s first battle honour the association the formation of the ppcli association 
 occurred in the mid 20son 0:20s 0:on a city by city basis my understanding could be inaccurate but i believe 
 the edmonton branch came into existence in 1923 the activity of this branch consisted of one meeting per year to 
 celebrate frezenberg the format consisted of a parade to the cenotaph in those days located on 102 st just at 
 the top of the river bank after the ceremony the group returned to the macdonald hotel for the annual business 
 meeting and banquet a committee organized immediately following wwii resulted in the formation of the present day ppcli national association 
 i understand 0:under 0:stand that norman mccowan of winnipeg is the sole surviving member of that committee in 1946 i 
 attended my first association meeting as an ex patricia with my father and for the next few years the make 
 up of the branch consisted 0:con 0:sisted of 20 to 30 world war i vets and a handful of wwii 
 returnees there came a time when age became a problem and bob sproule recommended and made a motion that the 
 limited funds on hand some 300 00 be sent to st george s church in england and that the edmonton 
 branch be wound up this was one occasion where the few other wwii vets and i won the vocal war 
 and the motion was defeated this had a downside as shortly thereafter i was catapulted into the president s chair 
 frezenberg if you ever watch the program on the history channel about the canadians in the 2nd battle of ypres 
 1915 you may become totally confused unless you are aware that this title 2nd battle of ypres 1915 embraced two 
 closely related but distinct german drives and that the second 0:sec 0:ond of these which began more than a week 
 after the first had ended was met entirely by infantry and cavalry divisions of the british army the glory for 
 thwarting the first attack which covered the period april 22nd to 27th and included the first use of gas as 
 an offensive 
 the patrician 2001 109 weapon belongs to the ist canadian division no mention is made of the ppcli for two 
 reasons 1 they were still part of the british army and 2 the battle they and the rifle brigade were 
 involved including gas erupted some eleven days later with one exception all the areas of the high ground which reached 
 a maximum elevation of 210 feet above sea level changed hands between the first and second phase of the battle 
 the exception was bellewaerde ridge the smallest of them all and only 165 feet above sea level it was to 
 be the pivot of the engagement on may bth in official terminology 0:ter 0:minology the action was decreed as the 
 battle of frezenberg and bellewaerde ridge the patricia history indicates that on may bth and surrounding days the regiment was 
 holding ridge the important point in my view is the realization that this was basically the end of the patricia 
 originals some 1 000 more or less all ranks were engaged in action 150 marched out closer to home it 
 may be good thing that the 150 included two particular soldiers otherwise patricia munro and myself would not be here 
 imperishable princess pats the following is a newspaper report which appeared in british papers in 1915 of the engagement celebrated 
 as the battle of frezenberg the tale of deathless glory of the ppcli is told below from the moment when 
 princess patricia presented her colours to the battalion at ottawa on august 23 bidding every man good luck and safe 
 return to the sad but glorious night when the tiny remnant of that band of heroes stood beside the open 
 graves of comrades with lt niven who is mentioned in dispatches today grasping the precious colours battered bloody but still 
 intact the narative is contributed by the canadian record officer serving with the canadian division it is one of the 
 noblest and most deeply moving documents of the war to such valour and such love does it bear witness the 
 early trench warfare in which the battalion took part is described and reference is made to the death of col 
 farquhar the commanding officer by a stray bullet on march 20th he was succeeded by lieut col buller the narrative 
 may be taken up from may 4th from april 21st and through the following days of the second battle of 
 ypres the regiment had been in the trenches some distance south and west of the trenches occupied by canadian division 
 on may 4th the regiment occupied 0:occu 0:pied a new line on the morning of that day a strong enemy 
 attack developed this was repulsed with considerable loss to the enemy which demolished several of the trenches at night the 
 regiment was relieved by the kings shropshine light infantry and withdrawn to reserve trenches in this unhealthy neighborhood no place 
 by this time was safe and on may 
 110 the patrician 2001 sth by the splinter of a shell lieut col buller was unfortunate enough to lose an 
 eye major gault arrived during the day and took over command the battalion was in high spirits and cheered their 
 arrival of an officer to whom all ranks were attached just after dark on the night of may 6th the 
 battalion returned to the trenches and relieved the kslf throughout the night and all the following 0:fol 0:lowing day it 
 was assailed by a constant and heavy bombardment the roll call on the night of the 7th showed the strength 
 of the battalion as 625 the day that followed was at once the most critical and the most costly in 
 the history of the battalion early in the morning particularly heavy shelling began on the right flank soon enfilading the 
 fire trenches at 5 30 it grew in intensity and gas shells began to fall at the same time a 
 number of germans were observed coming at the double from the hill in front of the trench this movement was 
 arrested by heavy rifle fire by 6 am every telephone wire both to the brigade hq and also to the 
 trenches had been cut all signalers pioneers orderlies and servants were ordered into the support trenches for the needs of 
 the moment left no place for super numeraries every single canadian upon the strength was from that time forward in 
 one or other of the trenches a short and fierce struggle 0:strug 0:gle decided the issue for the time being 
 the advance of the germans was checked and those of the enemy who were not either sheltered by buildings dead 
 or wounded crawled back over the crest of the ridge to their own trenches by this time the enemy had 
 two and perhaps three machine guns in adjacent buildings and were sweeping the parapets of both the fire and support 
 trenches an orderly took a note to brigade hq informing them exactly of the situation of the battalion about 7 
 am major gault who had sustained his men by his coolness 0:cool 0:ness and example was severely hit by a 
 shell in the left arm and thigh it was impossible to move him and he lay in the trench as 
 did many of his wounded companions in great anguish but without a murmur for over ten hours the command was 
 taken over by lieut niven the next senior officer who was still unwounded heavy howitzers using high explosives combined with 
 field guns from this moment in a most trying bombardment both on the fire and support trenches the fire trench 
 on the right was blown to pieces at several points at nine o clock the shelling decreased in intensity but 
 it was the lull before the storm for the enemy immediately attempted a second infantry advance this attack was received 
 with undiminished resolution a storm of mg and rifle fire checked the assailants who were forced after a few indecisive 
 moments to retire and take cover the battalion accounted for large numbers of the enemy in the course of this 
 attack but it suffered seriously itself captain hill lieut martin triggs and de bay were all wounded at this time 
 at half past nine lieut niven established contact with king s own 
 the patrician 2001 111 yorkshire light infantry on the left and with the rifle brigade on the right both were 
 suffering heavy casualties from enfilade rifle fire and neither of course could afford any assistance at this time the bombardment 
 recommenced 0:recom 0:menced with great intensity the range of our machine guns was taken with extreme caution all without one 
 exception were buried those who served with them behaved with the most admirable coolness and gallantry two were dug out 
 mounted and used again one was actually disinterred three times and kept in action till a shell annihilated the whole 
 section cpl dover stuck to his gun throughout and although wounded continued to discharge his duties with as much coolness 
 as if on parade in the explosion that ended his ill fated gun he lost an leg and an arm 
 and was completely buried in the debris when he crawled out of all that what was left of the obliterated 
 trench and moaned for help two of his buds sprang from the support trench by this time the fire trench 
 and succeeded in carrying in his mangled and bleeding body but as all that remained of this brave solder was 
 being lowered into the trench a bullet put an end to his sufferings no bullet could put an end to 
 his glory at 2 pm lieut niven went with an orderly to the hq in obedience to brigade orders to 
 telephone to the general officer commanding the brigade complete details of the situation he returned at 2 20 p m 
 the orderlies who accompanied his both going and coming were hit by high explosive shells at 3 pfvl a detachment 
 of the king s shropshire light infantry who were also old comrades in arms of the princess patricia s reached 
 the support line with 20 boxes of small arms ammunition these were distributed 0:distrib 0:uted and the party bringing them 
 came into line as reinforcement occupying 0:occupy 0:ing the left of the support trench at four o clock the support 
 trenches were inspected and it was found that contact was no longer maintained with the regiment on the left the 
 gap extending for fifty yards at this moment the germans made their third and last attack it was arrested by 
 rifle fire although some individuals penetrated into the fire trench on the right at this point of the trench was 
 actually tenantless those who established a footing were few in numbers and they were gradually dislodged and so the third 
 and last attack was routed as a successfully 0:suc 0:cessfully as those which had preceded it the afternoon dragged on 
 the tale of casualties constantly growing 0:grow 0:ing and at ten o clock at night the company commanders being all 
 dead or wounded lieut niven and papineau took the roll call it disclosed a strength of 150 rifles and some 
 stretcher bearers at 11 30 at night the kings royal rifle corps relieved the battalion 0:battal 0:ion the reliving unit 
 helped those whom they replaced in the last sorrowful 0:sorrow 0:ful duty of burying those of their dead who lay 
 in the support and communication 0:commu 0:nication trenches those who had fallen in the fire trenches needed no graves for 
 the obliteration of their shelter had afforded a decent burial to their bodies behind the damaged trenches by the light 
 of the germans flares and amid the unceasing rattle of musketry relievers and relieved 
 112 the patrician 2001 combined in the last service which one soldier can render another beside the open graves with 
 heads uncovered all that was left of the regiment stood while lieut niven holding the colours of princess patricia battered 
 bloody but still intact tightly in his hand recalled all he could remember of the church of england service for 
 the dead long after the service was over the remnant of the battalion stood in solemn reverie unable it seemed 
 to leave their comrades until the col of the 3rd kings royal rifles corps gave them positive orders to retire 
 when led by lieut papineau they marched back 150 strong to reserve trenches on arrival they were instructed to proceed 
 to another part of the position where during 0:dur 0:ing the day they were shelled and lost five and three 
 wounded on may 15th major pelly arrived from england where he had been invalid on march 15th and took over 
 command from lieut niven who during this point of command had shown qualities worthy of a regimental commander of any 
 army in the world few indeed are left of the men who met in lansdowne park to receive the regimental 
 colours nearly a year ago but those who survived and the friends of who died may draw solace from the 
 thought that never in the history of arms have soldiers more valiantly sustained the gift and trust of a lady

 shall i deal with you have you always turned the other cheek to my church have you been true the 
 soldier squared his shoulders and said no lord i guess i ain t because those of us who carry guns 
 can t always be a saint i ve had to work a lotta sundays and at times my talk was 
 tough and sometimes i ve been violent because the world is awfully rough but i never took a penny that 
 wasn t mine to keep though i worked a lot of overtime when the bills got just too steep i 
 never passed a cry for help though at times i shook with fear and sometimes god forgive me i ve 
 wept unmanly tears i know i don t deserve a place among the people here they never wanted me around 
 except to calm their fears if you have a place for me here lord it needn t be too grand 
 i never expected or had too much but if you don t i ll understand there was a silence all 
 around the throne where the saints had often trod as the soldier waited quietly for the judgement of his god 
 step forward now you soldier you ve borne your burdens well walk peacefully on heaven s streets because you ve 
 done your time in hell
