 origins in canada go back to 1899 when 7 500 souls immigrated from russia and settled on the saskatchewan the

 local community opposition word and a rejection of all forms of to their communalism the doukhobors relocated to the interior
 of british columbia in 1907 their refusal to register communal property individually meant that their saskatchewan hands were confiscated and
 assigned to incoming settlers their refusal cost them a total of 258 880 acres of which 49 429 acres were
 cultivated it was a boon for new immigrants to occupy hands already tilled and in the frenzy of settlement no
 one paid mtich attention to doukhobor losses as a token concession the government made some of the lands available to
 doukhobors as a reserve on the basis of fifteen acres per person a total of 236 doukhobors opted for individual
 land registration and thus became known as independent doukhobors 2 a smaller more aggressive faction objected to their treatment and
 staged a public protest against the militarism of the government in the form of a march thereafter they became known
 as the sons of freedom right anastasia 1 house and bath house were built about 1926 the alberta connection functioned
 effectively until the dissolution of the ccub there were occasional incidents of protest against the alberta doukhobors during the years
 following the first world war because of their pacifism but for the most pant there was little disruption of life
 in the community over such matters 3 the ccub was dismantled in 1938 due to a sudden and unprovoked bank
 foreclosure on the organization although the community had nearly 8 million worth of property two business firms national trust and
 the sun life assurance company held a series of demand notes worth four per cent of their total worth or
 319 276 the notes were called and the british columbia supreme court allowed foreclosure action to commence the way was
 then clear for the british columbia government to take title to doukhobor lands and properties when the ccub was dismantled
 some lands were sold to in british columbia doukhobor life doukhobon adherents on a crop share took on an entirely
 different format basis and the rest were liquidated to from the very beginning grain farming and cattle raising were pay

 1993 in some ways anastasia s village was a communal experiment in isolation it was an isolation from social interchange
 and an isolation of economics and belief in the first instance village members were encouraged to have little to do
 with out siders even though a certain amount of trade went on with neighbours also when times were tough anastasia
 assigned certain men to work for neighbouring farmers when work was done a strict reporting of activities away from the
 village to anastasia was required the philosophy of them and us was adhered to which meant that everyone outside the
 village was considered an outsider including other doukhobors since anastasia s group was considered a renegade faction by ma inline

 idea it was deemed best to relinquish the growers in 1954 allowing this latter market to the pool the decision
 was lefi a come back and increase in company to extend its presence in to a vote of the local

 and becoming the second largesi milling lines had always been peaned this pattern continued over the prairie grain company after
 the saskatnext few years american ownership had chewan wheat pool then dropped tc domestically dominated but increased to over 1
 100 elevators by third behind the united grain grower 19 17 but this was only 35 per cent of by
 the early 1940 s now elevator companies also the total of prairie elevators down from by 1929 the three provincial
 pools and the 42 per cent figure of five years before the united grain growers owned ovei became increasingly controlled
 in 1921 their total was still over 1 100 one third of the prairie elevators and but this now represented
 only 30 per their presence triggered off a round of cent of the whole by canadian interests and the amalgamations
 in the private trade a canadians continued to mount a come at baker said there is no question rise of
 the farmer owned com back and increase in importance the that the rise of the pools was the main major
 flout milling lines had always been factor in the demise of independeni panies changed the complexion domestically dominated but now
 eleva companies firstly the pools set standards tot companies also became increasingly of doing business which others were of elevator
 operations forever controhled by canadian interests and forced to meet and this greatly reduced the rise of the farmer owned
 companies their profit per bushel weights grades changed the complexion of elevator and dockage were areas where the line operations
 forever in 1926 the alberta companies were forced by competition wheat pool had a commanding presence to change their former
 way of operating with 60 per cent of the provincial wheat secondly the pools by their method of acreage under
 pool contract in the 1920 s operating their business practices and below a deal was made between the united payment
 of patronage dividends were large numbers of wagons wait to unload gr ain atthealberta pacific elevator in grain growers and
 the alberta wheat capturing a larger proportion of the olds about 1906 alberta farmers pool in an attempt to avoid
 unnecessary business so obviously the return on the co operative is one of the other two duplication of elevators between
 the investment became unsatisfactory to the elevators in the background farmer owned companies at points line companies 3 during the
 1920 s and from the 1 940 s to the present day the amalgamation of many companies took place tik
 although some of them did ito s tic not directly affect alberta i n i ci they did radically alter
 the industry and thus had in provincial grain trade in 1921 there were 67 major elevator companies which direct repercussions
 on the controlled 89 per cent of the 3 789 elevators in 1929 the total was 62 companies controlling 96
 per cent of j the total of 5 155 elevators but then a spate of amalgamations took place in 1929
 with nine companies combining alberta company alliance into federal grain 4 four others joining grain and others to northas western
 grain 5 and five more hater em grain in 1930 enabling being consolidated as scathe grain 6 the latter company
 to expand from its calgary base in the case of scathe the amalgamation midland pacific sold its was somewhat different
 from the other western alberta and peace two as it represented a declining econ river elevators to united orny heading
 to a reorganization of a grain growers in 1954 when number of companies that had been the prairie wide organization
 under one family ownership for some was attempting to expand its time this situation also occurred with ‘ 14 base
 in alberta the formation of mccabe grain in 1929 reliance grain in 1936 and as the number of companies national
 grain in 1940 in addition to operating elevators dropped these major moves other smaller corn the number of amalgamapanics sold
 out to larger competitors and tions decreased but the scale helped to fuel the rise of pioneer grain 0 of
 these combinations grew united grain growers alberta pacific in alberta the pool grew grain 2 and the pools 3 by
 1933 there mostly by building new were only 37 of the major companies elevators taking over a few remaining by
 ator orbuy g me surplus left and by 1961 only 13 of these coin stock from the larger companies were
 still operating panics alberta pacific con tinued to increase in this significantly these amalgamations were same fashion but in the
 aided by the spatial distribution of the 1940 s it became involved in elevators involved the family companies larger deals
 its major acquisition came such as searle and peavey had for obvious reasons always tried to keep their lines in
