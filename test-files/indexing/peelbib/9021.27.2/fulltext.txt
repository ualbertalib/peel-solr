 it they told me to fasten his ice was not melted and he would conic to legs with a chain
 and i did so i lalsol drove life again all the people were there and a stake through the hole

 i saw napaysoosee cut off the head with ccl hot tea into moostoos s body we pour an axe the
 next day next day there was cli tea over him because his body was full a hole in the body
 where the axe had been of ice in the house sticking and napaysoosee told me to hold entominahoo napaysoosee came
 run the stake over the hole and he struck it ning to house where i was about noon next hut
 it would not go clown then napaysooday and said ‘ that man imoostoos is see told me to hold on
 and he took the moving is rising up from the ground stake made marks on it with charcoal and vcnt
 there and saw a blanket was over used some medicine words which i did not the body and legs all
 i saw as lie did not understand and when he struck it it went move if lie had we would
 all have died right down through napaysoosee is a mcdiof fright i saw payoo tie deceased legs to cine man
 next day napaysoosee drove pickets with trap chains the night of killing a big file into the body and also
 put a big it was not the chains that caused the swell stone iiito the body ng of moostoos s
 body hut the evil that entominahoo left body there and the cree indians were afraid of people who became weligos
 and held dances in which people dressed like the cannibal creatures above is such a dance in 1933 on the
 saddle lake reserve came away shutting the door the whole ed of moostoos murder hut the latter party went to
 lesser slave lake i think died while being escorted to fort saskatthe same day but not sure and on the
 way chewan by corporal phillips and constable met corporal phillips and reported matter warren at the trial the two remaining
 to him napaysoosee and chuck a chuck accused and the witnesses placed the greatwent back to camp with phillips er
 share of the blanie on chuck a chuck i was afraid moostoosl was coing to and since much of the
 testimony is garbled kill us the reason i was afraid is because i have limited my quotations to the accuswe
 hear froni all over that a person like ed the head man and the latter s wife that cleans out
 the whole of the people in the end payoo was acquitted while does not leave one the man was going
 to napaysoosee was found guilty of manbe wihktigoo look what he said about slaughter by the jury and justice rouleau
 his own children i never saw a wihktigoo sentenced him to two months in jail before but that is what
 i have heard they having moved into that country more say that a wihktigoo is immensely strong than 63 years
 ago it is my opinion that napaysoosee we were all crazy with of the four witnesses quoted the wife of
 fear and when we realizedi what we had entominahoo was the most creditable it done we left the place and
 left him there was payoo who had wielded the axe that among our own band i never saw or knew
 split moostoos s skull killing him instantof a wihktigoo kill and eat anyone but i ly true others had taken
 part in mutilathave heard of it often ing the corpse later three of the indians payoo napay i knew payoo
 his cree name was sosohsoosee and chuck a chuck were accus kan invariably referred to as soso while he would
 not speak to me of the execution depart from camp and threaten to kill and others did so confidentially they
 feared eat his kinfolk execution was the only solu soso for his medicine making powers in tion the medicine man
 usually acted as his evidence he had accused chuck a chuck the executioner napaysoosee red head and entominahoo it helps
 to explain the mutilation of of being medicine men but he concealed moostoos s body if one understands that the
 fact that the most powerful medicine since his turning wetigo was believed to man there was himself have been caused
 by demons having enter but let s not be too hard on soso who ed it especially the head the
 only way to as he saw it had acted in defence of the get rid of them was by opening
 up the skull lives of his people after all history reveals and body a gun would not be used because
 it made only a small hole only an that europeans and others burned witches axe or a rock would do
 the trick and allow who were believed to be possessed by soi 1 ic the demons to escape similarly they
 bedemon and there have been bigotted eccles lieved that when a man became a wetigo iastical authorities who burned people
 at his heart turned into solid ice the stake to cleanse their minds of doubts moostoos s son was an
 extremely intelliof the infallibility of religious pronounce gent handsome fellow whom i had known ments however preposterous since arriving at
 sturgeon lake he would you may ask what is meant by red head not speak about his father s execution
 but and the other conjurors making medicine the daughter felicity said her father had simply this it was believed that
 an evil not been a wetigo she claimed that he had spirit attempting to enter the mind of some gone
 to peace river crossing with a friend erstwhile normal human could he cast out some days earlier and the pair
 had gone on in many cases by the stronger mind and a long drunk using lemon extract they incantations of
 a medicine man if he found had even brought some home with them himself incapable of ejecting the evil spirit
 felicity and others were convinced that from his patient the medicine man con far from becoming a wetigo he had
 suffered eluded that the man was a wetigo and drove from delirium treine ls and had gone berhim into the
 wilderness to die of exposure serk the source of many tragedies among or starvation should the wetigo refuse to canadians

 mud edmonton district has been suffering from mud spelled large during the past week or two a fall of snow
 succeeded by thawing weather and some rain brought about a condition most unpleasant to those who had business on the
 roads while the wet weather caused some delay in threshing it was only a slight delay and no damage is
 reported the large number of threshers in the district this season makes it possible to get the crop into the
 granary much more speedily than ever before while all must agree that the weather has been anything but pleasant and
 that the roads are horrible it may be also well to remember that dry not wet weather is the enemy
 of agriculture in the northwest the great drawback to grain raising in the west is the dry spring particularly if
 the dry spring is preceded by a dry fall as it usually is if however the ground gets a good
 soaking in the fall as at present the ill effect of the dryness of the following spring is lessened correspondingly
 the water now in the ground will freeze there and remain all winter to furnish a supply of moisture in
 the spring and so ensuring an early start of the crop when no moisture comes in the fall and the
 ground freezes dry in the spring after the snow goes away the ground is as dry as in the fall
 for the snow having gone before the frost comes out of the ground the ground could not absorb any moisture
 from the snow in that case the crop ui ust wait for the first rains in the latter end of
 may before it can start it is a good thing to remember that mud makes wheat edmonton bulletin oct 31

 boom occurred in manitoba affecting several points on the canadian pacific railway notably brandon the first divisional point west of
 winnipeg where large prices were paid for lots during the parliamentary session of 1882 the opposition criticised the government for
 not taking steps to ensure that lands enhanced in value by the building of the railway accrued to the public
 and not to enterprising speculators or squatters the header of the government assured the house that steps would be taken
 to protect the public interest and orders were issued to reserve from homestead entry all hands within a mile belt
 along the iuiain line of ihe cpr in addition the land coninuissioner issued notices reserving a considerable area around such
 points such as qu appelle regina moose jaw medicine hat and calgary where there was a mounted police station such
 as at calgary notices were sent to the officer in charge with instructions to put the notices into effect while
 the police force executed all criiuuinal laws rigidly it must be confessed that they did not evince any considerable zeal
 in attempting to enforce the law regarding squatting on hand as far as calgary was concerned the situation was somewhat
 different in that portion of calgary lying south of the bow river between the mouth of the elbow and shaganappi
 point and extending up the elbow a short distance north of where the holy cross hospital is now located and
 then westerly to the foot of the hill and following the latter to said shaganappi point the mounted police since
 their first establishment in calgary had protected that area fully from squatting because they required it for pasture for their
 horses it was a tract of land well suited for grazing and upon which horses could he economically herded the
 only exception that i can recall is a building which i was advised by the mounted police officer in charge
 captain mcihree was erected with the permission of the police in the interests of the mcdougails it was a shop
 for the disposal of meat which was built near where the corner of seventh avenue and fourth street east now
 is the mcdougahls however never preferred any claim to the land although the mr pearce was a prominent western canadian

 the cpr racks at the junction of the bow and elbow should not obtain the said section in other rivers

 was a very fine iuuadc in not retaining the site basin there which could be cheaply rend i did succeed
 however in reserving a cred as a reservoir and i had an idea that boulevard 200 feet in width extending
 awater could be brought in by gravity from long the north bank of the bow river from the elbow river
 this supposition was yen the easterly hinuit of section 14 to the wesfied from surveys made some years subse terhy
 hinuit of section 1 7 that reservation quently by the springbank irrigation schenue was exceedingly hotly contested by persons however
 the jackson brothers squatted who claimed to have a right to that land on that section soiuue tinie after knowing
 by reason of squatting on the hand to the it was reserved at least if they did not north of
 it they said that they squatted know they could easily have found out there because of the frontage on the
 river then they conimenced an active propaganda and this would be destroyed by the reservato obtain homestead entry on it
 i used what tion of the boulevard i have no doubt that influence i could to prevent this and sue
 if the contestants had taken the trouble to ceeded until soiuue years later when they get up a petition that
 99 percent of the presented a petition signed by 80 percent people to whoiui it presented would have of the
 citizens of calgary stating that they signed it did not want the suggested reservoir the when section 16 was sub
 divided into petition stated that the place was not suit lots in the winter of 1883 84 i succeeded able
 for that purpose aiud therefore calgary in having what is now mewata park reservcitizens had no use for it and
 that an in ed another parcel of land was set aside as justice was being done to the jackson bro
 a result of a visit of the hon thomas white thers by not giving theiuu entry to it of minister
 of the interior to calgary in the course armed with this petition they oh suiuinier of 1886 he was waited
 on by a tamed what they wanted it is probable deputation who asked the government to that in this like
 iuiost petitions 98 percent buy a site for a court house and jail in the of the persons who signed
 it knew nothing neighbourhood of where the city hall now about the facts and they cared less but had stands
 mr white replied that there was the nuania of attaching their naiuies to any no money available and with the
 govern ment already owning a large tract of land while on this matter of parks i would on section 16
 he could not justify a re like to say that it is most unfortunate that quest for a grant however
 he was willing the government did not retain tithe to any to reserve a piece of hand for that purpose
 land along the rivers which was subject to on section 16 i was asked to make the flooding such land
 would have been ideal selection and the present site of the court for the creation of parks because of the
 house was selected i would have preferred moisture of the sub soil and what a maggoing either immediately to the
 south or nificent belt we would have had along our north of eighth avenue but the original rivers for all

 at shaganappi could have been settled with for very little point was later located and although they money or could
 legally have been ignored applied for 80 acres of land at that point it was felt advisable to select the
 place eventually some 60 acres were set apart mentioned the town council protested strongly a in addition certain blocks of

 insisted that ing the mcdougall school site on fourth the responsibility lie with the corporation and fifth avenues between sixth

 interests in the town were tam about that while on the subject of headed by colonel walker who thought it
 park reservations it might be not amiss to advisable to obtain a reservation of land tell how calgary came to
 possess what is for agricultural purposes the matter was now central park and the land on which referred to me
 by the deputy minister of the first public library was located a half the interior and after a considerable disinterest
 in section 15 was acquired back cussion it was decided to grant them what in 1 882 by the canada
 north west land is now victoria park augustus carney had company and when this was sub divided already preferred a
 claim to this land and and put on the market it was controlled although his claim was not recognized it
 by townsite trustees which represented the was decided to sell him five acres of land interests of the cpr and
 the canada north on the west side of the site for 100 per west land co those trustees at that

 days later ever rights the railway possessed with re when he received a letter notifying hinu of gard to taxation

 between the corporation of calgary and accept the proposition the townsite trustees after wrangling over it was specified in the
 victoria park the matter for some time a compromise was grant that the land was to be used for agrieffected
 by the corporation relinquishing cultural purposes and it was well that this its rights to taxation up to a certain
 date was done otherwise the city would have in exchange for the townsite trustees con sold it for town lots

 simple invention some weeks ago a herald representative in company with messrs hull martin maw millar bannister and a few
 others accepted an invitation from mr maloney to accompany him to mr graves farm a couple of miles from calgary
 to see his new grain header at work mr maloney invented the machine and patented it and with the assistance
 of mr james mcallister of w h lee s blacksmith shop built the initial machine this summer a pair of
 horses was hitched to the machine and they walked off with it with the greatest of ease cutting the heads
 clean off a 12 foot swath and depositing them into a box large enough to hold the heads from half
 an acre when by the tilt of a lever handled by the driver they were dumped on the ground without
 stopping the machine by this invention the heads off 25 acres can be cut and left in dumps in a
 day and then by another machine also invented and patented by the same gentlemen the piles on 50 acres can
 be gathered and put into a stack or hauled to a thresher in a day mr maloney claims and we
 think justly that he can head and stack the grain for 30 cents per acre thus saving the cost of
 twine stooking and all of the hard labour necessary to harvesting a large crop he has also an attachment for
 the machine which will thresh and sack fully ripened grain at a cost not exceeding two cents per bushel the
 straw if required for fodder can afterwards be cut by a mower just as well as if the heads were
 on or it can be burned off if not required the stacker like the header is a simple but ingenious
 contrivance and will pile the heads hay or straw up in stacks 12 feet high and is worked by one
 man and two horses the value of these machines in large grain growing countries such as manitoba or the western
 states is simply invaluable and will save the farmer about 3 per acre in harvesting operations besides reducing the cost
 of threshing to a minimum the machine is entirely of iron and steel and the one built reflects great credit
 on mr mcallister who turned it out in as good shape as though it had come from the best equipped
 machine shop the herald predicts for the machine a great success and feels certain that it will revolutionize harvesting operations
 mr maloney intends taking his machine to winnipeg in a few days where he will probably make arrangenuents for building
 a thousand of them for next year s operations in manitoba the benefit ol the invention to the farmers of
 manitoba can hardly be estimated as the large sums of nioney sent east annually for binders and twine can all
 be saved to the farmers and will it is estimated effect a difference of at least froiui 10 cents to
 1 5 cents per bushel on their grain which will make an enornuous difference in cash kept in the country
 each year in the case of a frozen crop which would not pay the cost of ordinary harvesting the farmer
 can do all his work himself without haying out a dollar for hired labour and have an immense quantity of
 feed for cattle or pigs the cost of the whole machine will not exceed 250 calgary herald nov 5 1896

 visited the district and unexpectedly pounced on the houses under the control of winnie sinipson and jennie hayes the ground

 a rc iives of canada this is history not so much of the fam ottawa ous south saskatchewan battalion itself
 as my first reaction on picking up this volthe story of the men who fought with the unie was to
 question the value of a series battalion in world war one there is a of thumbnail biographies of no iuuore
 than world of difference battalion histories tend seven hundred words each after all what to be concerned with battles won
 and lost can one say about george brown john a with honors gained in the traditional heroics macdonald crowfoot or
 sandford fleming of war this is a soldier s eye view of the within that brief space not a great
 deal killing grounds of flanders during the last obviously yet this book pulls the reader half of the war it
 is the story as a hundred in and the cumulative effect is a growing survivors renieuuuber it a hundred vignettes
 anuazenuent at the variety of personalities that will have our generation cringing and that have shaped the political social and
 shaking with angry resentment at the awful cultural life of this diverse country the cniiuiinahity of the flanders campaigns and
