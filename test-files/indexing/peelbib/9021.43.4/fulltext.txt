 beautiful country jack went slip and slide and then followed up the over his first summit today amid got a
 jumping pound canyon again a storm thrill out of seeing the water run both was brewing and prospects of another
 ways ducking in sight we decided to make camp if a suitable place was found we our camp tonight brings
 back found it and here we are in a valley of memories dan and i camped here about ten acres
 quite clear only a tree fourteen years ago it looks much the hem c and there just right for tethering
 same except the creek bed is changed horses and a creek and evergreens for where once we caught numerous ti
 out is water and shelter just as we were ready only gravel bars today incidentally kip to eat it started
 to rain again but this was with us fourteen years ago amid is time everything was snug and we ate
 our with us on this tlip we expect to find bacon beans bread and strawberry jam slow going tomorrow lots
 of brule under cover while the rain vented its ahead no doubt plenty of axe work for anger on the
 tent roof since then now yours truly moonlight is a little lame 8 00 p m it has been alternately
 stormy tonight i hope it doesn t get worse and and fine we have enjoyed a lazy after spoil our
 trip fine all day the red sky noon rambling around when the last night was a true prophet ford creek

 an emergency were put to good tuesday july 30 1935 use myrle and jack have turned in to up at
 6 00 am and found 1 2 ice on keep warm and i will now do the same water pail
 which was the reason why we after giving the horses a final check all were cold last night the sun
 seemed over as i look up i see a red sky in the to be show in coming over the
 mountain west over the tops of the pines a fine top and in spite of the work to be done
 day tomorrow and will camp on canyon it was mid morning before we really got creek warm during the night
 we heard a mountain lion but refrained from all monday july 29 1935 discussion of it on jack s account
 it was 8 30 p m and we are all set for the camp a clear bright day with no
 drawbacks above at canyon creek we were six hours on whatsoever the trail today and i think we were all
 the author is seen with his horse glad to make camp jack is standing the like the previous day at
 least the last prhwe which he used on his trip into trip wonderfully well although today few hours of it
 our way was thru brule the foothills in 1935 was rather a bad one for him after we timber but
 fortunately the ranger or his had been on the trail for about two assistant from elbow river had recently hours
 he discovered that he had lost his cut out all the windfalls which was leather coat myrle and jack went
 on fortunate as he evidently had to cut a lot with the outfit and i back tracked of down timber
 we got a picture of two looking for the coat which i found less young buck deer with their heads
 just than a mile from our starting point i let peeking out of a brush thicket after prince show his
 stuff and was back with taking a picture we rode quite close to the pack ponies in an hour and
 a half them and they stood unmoved with ears alberta 8 i t t i auttimn 1 5 up watching
 us with their big enquiring day we passed to the south west of eyes altogether unafraid i believe jack moose

 about half the size of a gopher which sat the last three days the lookout point has hunched up by
 the track almost under been visible to us illustrating the wide the horses feet as we rode by he range
 of territory visible from the moose referred to such events as adventures mountain lookout after making camp and needless to
 say every turn in the trail and eating as usual we went fishing and brings new wonders to him while
 i have found better fishing in the we saw some wonderful elbow or ford creek in the past we for
 miles we rode along thru muskeg were able to pull out enough trout some country i cannot understand and brule
 with the magnificent spectacle cutthroat and some bull trout to provide of the nihahi mountains to our west anicemealoffisharoundseveno clock

 their respects they country to the west were returning from a hiking trip to to find a more beautiful kananaskis
 the evening was cold and as we arrived at our destination early they were attired in shorts i felt sorry
 for about a mile above the camp we ran into them they had walked from elbow country green timber free
 from any sign of the lake today and were planning on making devastating forest fires of the past the mouth
 of canyon creek tomorrow which are much more in evidence on the they left at ten and we are now
 turning elbow watershed than on that of the in moonlight lameness is a little better jumping pound and bow during
 the and it looks like we can carry on alberta history autumn 1995 wednesday july 31 1935 inadvisability of going
 further with jack the less said about today the better we under such conditions we decided to hit planned an
 early start up shortly after for bragg creek it stopped raining five horses saddled before breakfast around mid momning so
 we packed imp and everything ready to go visibility and started down the elbow at 11 00 poor valleys full
 of fog but we expected am we were scarcely started when it it to rise early instead before the tent
 started to main again packing was done was down it started to rain and it has umider considerable difficulty for
 rained ever since except the last half instance the lash m ropes were so hour and it is now 8
 00 p m it wasn t shrunken froni the prolonged rain that saw bear moose deer and just light showers
 but a steady they were scarcely long enough to miiake downpour enough to raise the level of the diamond whemeas
 when dry they mountain lion tracks today we the creek about a foot i found some old were both several
 feet longer than sheets of galvanized iron which were necessary they stretched and packs got a picture of two young
 buck once on the roof of a forestry cabin loosened continually so it was difficult which once stood on the
 spot these i to make decent time on the trail trails deer with their heads just built into a sort
 of round heater in front were running with water and hillside of the tent with the flap of the tent
 trails were extremely slippery peeking out of a brush thicket staked out in front and one of our tarps moonlight
 fell several times one of fastened from the flap to the ground on these times in doing so on a
 narrow trail the north side we managed to keep he broke the front latigo necessitating quite comfortable except for a
 tedious job of repacking under expeditions in search of wood with extremely difficult conditions when we variable winds we were
 bothered arrived at the falls it was pouring rain considerably with smoke in spite of this myrle took jack over
 to see the falls although doing so meant a it has been a bad day for jack shut in drenching
 in the tall grass and brush and and nothing to do but he acquitted a wet seat on remounting their
 horses himself very well he had a slight cold tonight but is already asleep full of hot at ted howard
 s ranger station we lemonade so i am sure he will be o k talked to the look out man
 from moose in the morning mountain and he informed us that he had watched the progress of our trip a
 few minutes ago it looked like from the top of moose mountain he clearing but it has again clouded over
 if had even seen us take shelter from the it continues to rain i can t ask myrle and hail
 storm shortly after we left the y jack to go further into the mountains jumping pound ranger station z il
 we were extremely fortunate in our ‘ location today and might not fare so well from the ranger station we
 took the old further in i found prince with a loose trail across country to bragg creek shoe and renailed
 this was about the valley taking the north fork of the trail ‘ ‘ only constructive job for the day
 except from the little muskeg creek on we the hewing of wood may the weather found the last part of
 this trail badly man be good to us tomorrow grown up with alder and willows so much so that prince
 in the lead was thursday august 1 1935 hesitant about breaking thru and getting at 5 00 am today it
 wasn t raining but the drenching which was his in every was still cloudy and threatening before case we pulled
 into pence s old place six it started to rain occasional glimpses around 7 00 p m with no lay
 over on the of the mountain peaks showed them to trail and nothing to eat since breakfast be covered with
 fresh snow all the signs all of us pretty well drenched seemed to point to a prolonged spell of wet
 weather so after thinking over what jack stood the trip well never once to do giving consideration to the complained
 of wet cold or hunger alberta history autumn 1995 eight hours straight in the saddle is a poor and the
 rats were fast and i am good day s work for anyone even under unable to report any kill at
 any other favorable conditions time one could hardly imagine sleeping under such conditions but with every we found the old
 cabin in terrible shape thing afloat outside and still raining we pack rats in complete control the sniell were thankful
 for the accommodation of the rats was evidemit before even we had in spite of the quite evident opening the
 doom we got some dry wood handicaps we finally fell asleep with after a lot of searching built a fire
 in the rats frisking everywhere warm and heater in the living room and cooked our comfortable and not a bit
 disturbed by supper the kitchen was in terrible shape our surroundings although jack insisted and could not possibly be used
 by the on sleeping in the middle of the bed time we stai ted to eat the rats were between
 his mother and dad which scum rying every where if you weren t was the first occasion he demanded this
 careful you were likely to step on one accommodation he insisted that the rats ‘ and several times myrle on
 so doing let had nothing to do with his decision but out a scream but took it all in good
 part we did not agree on this we laid a coil spring on the living room friday august 2 1935
 floor spread our bedding and turned in last night was rather hectic to say the after putting all our grub
 in the pack least we of course were all tired and in boxes out of reach of the rats we
 left a spite of the inducement to stay awake good fire burning in the old franklin and make sure that
 the rats didn t chew heater and could lie iii bed and watch the one s ear off or otherwise
 disfigure rats scurrying around us i was some other part of one s anatomy which determined to kill a few
 of them but in might not be under cover we all slept spite of lying in bed for nearly an
 hour soundly until around 4 00 am by armed with a club which i wielded which time the local rats
 i believe had enthusiastically whenever one came called in reinforcements from other rat close in time flickering light my aim
 was colonies in the hope of making a concerted drive to rid their home of the unwelcome visitors we were
 awakened by their mobilization manoeuvres and set ourselves in our position determined to hold our ground rats to the right
 of us rats to the left of us and even rats under us for a squadron of them took up

 posed on kip in front of the b y t he numero u s coils and t he difficul t

 calling for help by ra y bouncing around on the springs we apparently increased their discomfiture and we naturally did
 all we could to bother them the other rats would advance omi one ‘ side of the bed and chatter
 and scold and on being driven back would take up ‘ their position on the other side before going to
 bed myrle and i had supplied ourselves with a p ile of ammuni t ion on each side of the
 bed in the form of stove alberta history autumn 1995 m when for ing therefore ourselves difficult to move and
 1 my fortunately lengths of firewood when the four am offensive began we found that the rats during the time
 that we were asleep had carried away our ammunition as well as the supply of wood stacked up in front
 of the stove fom dmying we themefore found oui selves shomt of ammunition when the attack started my riding boots
 apparently for obvious reasons were difficult to move and 1 was called upon to use them as weapomis i was
 able to use them to good advantage and was able to stand off the attack on my side with these
 and on the other side myrle used the electric lantern occasionally flashing its rays my way to enable me to
 better place my blows fortunately a sharp breeze was blowing and between rain squalls the grass dried ‘ ‘ rapidly
 and we spent a lot of time picking luscious wild strawberries p growing in the clearing we intended to put
 up oui tent before night and sleep in it rather than spend another night with ‘ the rats evening brought
 more rain and ‘ as we wanted to have a dry tent top pack in the mom ning if the
 weather was still unsettled we decided to again sheep in the house before bed timi me we endeavored to drive
 out any stray rats and did so killing one which was a little slower than the others we turned in
 early and were able to get to sleep without much trouble daylight was not long in coming and with its
 arrival our enemies withdrew to satnmrda au ust 3 1935 nurse their grievances until the next from four a m
 we again had a bad time night if we were still holding our own with the rats and when jack
 who went to t sleep in the middle of the bed woke up n dawn came cloudy and unsettled and
 we around six am and found himself on the decided to lie around and dry out our equipment and mest
 our horses it cleared later and about mid morning jake ‘ that he was not the only one who preferred

 day and that the reason for the transfer was that the clouds back of moose mountain jack was too warm
 and was continually indicated that the weather around ford kicking amid striking in an attempt to rid creek and beyond
 was even worse than himself of some of the covers and get we were experiencing we were therefore glad that
 we had made up our cooled off much to her annoyance minds the previous day to move closer to civilization
 and had acted accordingly the weather was still unsettled and we early decided we would be better off at last
 night on removing the pack from shaganappi and decided to hit for home moonlight i found that he was scalded
 moonlight s back was worse if anything on his withers under the front cross tree and he couldn t carry
 even an empty of the saddle i did not put anything on it saddle this made it impossible to take
 as i figured the rain would wash it and our complete outfit home we therefore help it more than anything
 i could do had to leave most of our stuff at mrs this morning his back was badly white s

 get better grazing down the creek at 9 30 a m jack rode the as he was losing weight and
 not doing six miles to mrs white s behind his well also so that he got shelter in the mother

 myrle and jack made the 34 mile ride in line style neither were l ovem tired as a matter of
