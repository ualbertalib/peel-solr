 jr ij zt 7 zip izzl j 1 j the good old days when it was considered impolite to labour 
 the weather as a topic of conversation have passed and the old order changeth with a vengeance although the weather 
 hereabouts has been laboured and belaboured very impolitely for the last month not even the most rigid exponents of etiquette 
 took exception x j erhaps it was bacause they were doing it the selves we are glad to be able 
 to announce however that all our pipes are now thawed out and repaired that all our socks and boots are 
 again dry and that life has once more resumed its normal routine one of the brighter aspects of our unusual 
 and devastating precipitation is that although it cost millions of dollars to thousands of people many of whom could ill 
 afford it it has provided many many times that number of people with the employment 0:employ 0:ment necessary to keep 
 the proverbial wolf out in his native haunts it is an ill md that blows no one good the new 
 year hes started with every indication of an upward trend in conditions throughout the country the published annual reports of 
 lar e companies hich fill our newspapers reflect the better business conditions prevailing throughout the country unemployment figures are lower 
 there is an air of returning prosperity every l here and a feeling that canada hes progressed farther than any 
 other nortion of the world in her economic recovery from the recent depression it i to be hoped that the 
 canadian militia will be a part to all this and will reflect more than ever before the cheerfulness and enthusiasm 
 that has permeated all canadian life ay we recommend to our readers attention the story of montrose s splendid march 
 as told by i ajor u g colquhoun li c in his hat a highlander can do it is a 
 thrilling account of a very splondid military achievement and makes us wonder if after all some of our best military 
 history is not comparatively unknown 
 75 in this issue we hear a word from our instructional cadre personnel stationed in vancouver may we beg others 
 of our personnel scattered over western canada to write and let us know just how they spend their lives we 
 think that we ought to be more closely in touch with all patricia s the above paragraph might well be 
 applied to many ex patricia s throughout the country they gather together in clubs and associations but are slow to 
 make any effort at keeping in touch with their old comrades in other cities in this issue we have some 
 welcome notes from winnipeg and vancouver let us have stories of the lives and doings of all ex p p 
 s everywhere our story this time is again from the facile pen of cpl l c morrison it is interesting 
 to note that this story was recently dramatized and presented over c k y at winnipeg when it met with 
 a very favourable reception referring to our remarks on painting of barrack blocks in our last issue we are constrained 
 after a mournful glance at our coat sleeves to remark that the paint is still wot we are always glad 
 to hear from members of the regiment and when thay send us cash for subscriptions our emotion practically amounts to 
 ecstasy but recently we had to spend all the money on an interpreter to make out the address on the 
 letterhead it was pottneu a arlborg tirol we acknowledge receipt of the following magazines the 0:magazines 0:the lancashire lad journal 
 of the loyal regiment the goat royal canadian dragoons yours faithfully 
 76 what highlanders can do by kajor g cclquhoun i c p 1 c l 1 being the account of 
 a parch lade by 1500 highlanders under montrose in 1645 after defeating the campbells at inveraray christmas 1644 montrose marched 
 his army north to inverlochy where lay the mighty castle at the foot of ben nevis by that time the 
 army s numbers were down to 1500 again a highland victory always lessened the victorious as much as a defeat 
 5 the cattle of the campbells had been more effective than their claymores in driving back half of montrose s 
 soldiers to their homes with them continuing along the glen of albin monrose 0:mon 0:rose reached the head of loch 
 ness by the last week in january 1645 the force was tired out with their mountain march and an army 
 of five thousand lay ahead of them at inverness under seaforth 0:seaf 0:orth at this time a message was received 
 that a force of three thousand campbells under sir duncan campbell was now at inverlochy 0:inver 0:lochy 30 miles away 
 montrose was therefore about half way between 0:bet 0:ween the campbells and seaforth s forces f further inland bailie s 
 forse with his committee of estates debating society on the west the sea coast between three armies and the sea 
 it was a good trap during the last year montrose had decided that the best place for his son and 
 heir lord john graham was with his army and the story of the march over the mountains from loch ness 
 to inverlochy is told as he saw it very early on the morning of the 31st january 1645 the army 
 was on the move again said its leader he will smash the strongest first seaforth s army was the larger 
 but was made up chiefly of townsmen and raw recruits argyll s army under sir duncan campbell was a magnificent 
 body of men trained for war and well equipped under a first rate leader so that the 3000 campbells 0:camp 
 0:bells were far more formidable than seaforth s 5000 raw recruits and townsmen montrose had led his army up the 
 great glen of albin by the shores of loch lochy to loch ness nov they must go back on their 
 
 77 tracks but by another route for their only chance lay in a surprise attacks and argyll s and seaforth 
 s scouts would be scanning the great glen for a sight of them ho canal nor road ran there then 
 but it was held to be the only possible route between inverlochy and the head of loch ness by which 
 any army could travel certainly any army with horses and in mid winter montrose thought otherwise with the help of 
 lan lorn who had come by the hill road of glen hoy and of stray cowherds he was sure of 
 finding a way across the mountains for his men and even for the little bodyguard of horse under lord airlie 
 which carried the clarions to salute the king s standard his men had been rested for two or three days 
 and v cll fed and so ho told them as he advised them to buckle in their bolts and not 
 hope for any food but the oatmeal they could carry for that mixed with water was all the food they 
 could have till they won back to inverlochy and no later he promised them than tomorrow 0:to 0:morrow evening he 
 himself had no more nor willie wallace three and half centuries ago when he and his handful of men had 
 set out on their shaggy ponies to conquer the huge chivalry of england his way through the mountains was a 
 rough one it started in the river bed of the tarff see sketch map which led them some miles up 
 into the hills the winter s morning was still black as they plunged into the icy shallow running water and 
 began to splash their way up among the rocks the few horses had to be led johnnie felt as though 
 his feet were being sawn off then all feeling left them so that he did not know how he moved 
 he stumbled slipped shouted with laughter as old golkitto his beard glimmering in the darkness gripped him by the shoulder 
 and saved him from falling full length in one of the pools that ley like black pits among the tumbling 
 white form the hills towered over them grey monsters scarcely to be distinguished from the sky but that was every 
 minute growing paler and then come a shaft of red through the blackest clouds and suddenly the whole vast scene 
 took shape and colour round them there they were struggling out of the course of the stream in the growing 
 light to sec dawn come up behind the monadhliath mount ains tho raw wind came down their sides and cut 
 at johnnies wet legs but little he cared with them roughened already to a surface like leather rawhide brogues cut 
 from the fresh skin of cattle with all its hair on bound with leather thongs and pierced with holes to 
 let the water run through those were the shoes for this journeying he wore a kilted plaid like the meanest 
 of alasdair s kerns and a sheepskin coat with the wool turned inside for warmth ond so x rotccted by 
 its natural grease that in the heaviest rain or snow his shoulders remained dry inside it in no other clothes 
 could one move so freely over mountains that any lowlander would have called impassable 
 78 ho could not ride for not only did the cold then strike more deadly moving as slowly as all 
 had to do but it was the most difficult part of the work to get the horses over those precipitous 
 slopes all slippery with ice and more than once it was thought they would have to be left behind the 
 springing ease of alasdair s groat wolf hound leaping and trotting his happy way over the most difficult ground was 
 an insult to the clumsy panting efforts of every beast with four logs or two the ide surfaces of rock 
 wore no harder nor smoother than the bar stretches of bent shining white with frost the alternative was generally to 
 wa de knee deep through snows and they wore lucky it was not worse a snowstorm or thick mist might 
 have wiped out the little army altogether driving it blindfold into some vast drift but the hillside lay clear in 
 the faint sunlight of the easterly wind that turned all colours pale and grey across a further slope went in 
 a long lolloping 0:loll 0:oping trot the dark shapes of some beasts that they knew to be wolves they could 
 not stop to rest that night nor could they make a fire that might warn some possible distant scout of 
 their whorcr bouts one of tho men killed a roc buck with an arrow from his long bow in an 
 instant a hurried hungry cluster of men had gathered round it cut and c0110p d it asunder and fallen on 
 its raw flesh here s a juicy bit for my young lord graham johnnie tried to share his bleeding morsel 
 ith his father who refused to lessen tho rations and the boy sick at first taste of the tough flesh 
 without salt soon devoured it all greedily the raw muat gave him now strength he stumbled on through tho growing 
 darkness saw the full moon swim out above the mountains 0:mount 0:ains giving light enough to the tired mountainy men 
 to distinguish 0:distin 0:guish among the varying blacknesses of the moor he heard the long howl of a wolf rise 
 lamentably through the night at sight of such strangers as had never before ventured into these wastes he saw the 
 army before and behind streeling out in a black dotted line across the glistening icy slope of the mountain each 
 breath he drew was so cold that it hurt he seemed to have no breath left he staggered forward and 
 would have fallen but for his father s hand tho lad is nearly spent montrose said in a troubled voice 
 to alasdair as he come up to them c nd for answer alasdair hoisted lord graham upon his back winding 
 his plaid tight round and round them both so as to warm him and hold him fast 
 79 it was no use for johnnie to protest that at fourteen he was a grown man and quite as 
 tall as some of our men he wag carried in turn by alasdair s biggest highlandera their warmth against his 
 keeping snug where he would have frozen on horseback kb one hut his father could make them do itj he 
 saw him moving now forward now bach among all that endlessly straggling 0:stragg 0:ling column walking beside them cheering them 
 on by telling them that in less than twentyfour hours now they would have reached their goal and they would 
 smash the sons of diarmaid once more this time for ever johnnie could see the men stepping out with more 
 pride and courage hen his father had spoken to thorn cold and white as a corpse the second dawn came 
 over that desert place and now it was the first of february they were at roy bridge not more than 
 nine miles from inverlochy if they could have gone direct but they had to keep hidden among the hills they 
 wore now on the slopes of the mountains round ben levis the highest in britain the campbells had sunt out 
 no scouts over the wilderness they had been crossing no commander could have thought that necessary but now there was 
 a constant danger that they might meet some advanced patrol and so they did not long after fording the spoan 
 a swollen roaring torrent that reached their middles when they clashed full into a foraying party of argyll s he 
 it sol i rovi that foray they never returned sang lan lorn liacdonald as the proceeded on their way j 
 or not one man of that band did they leave alive to run and tell argyll that he had seen 
 the whole of the king s army in scotland a scattered column amounting to no more than fifteen hundred struggling 
 across the frozen mountains with the footsore stumbling tread of desperately weary men gaunt shaggy raw footed men in sheepskins 
 and rough plaids that had been drenched in the spoan their eyes ravenous and red with lack of sleep a 
 pack of hungry wolves in the stinking 0:stink 0:ing garb of wet sheep on they clambered their way among the 
 hills until as the evening sky reddened in frost again they came up over the lower slope of ben itevis 
 that looks down upon inverlochy montrose was in the advance guard it was not till eight o clock that the 
 rest of his exhausted army had come up with him down below ley the castle of invorlochy and round about 
 it the e rsnp of the campbells three thousand strong they must have soon coaie of the column come over 
 the shoulder of the lower slope but they can have had no idea that it was anything more than a 
 foraying party of raiders from saras hoctllo clan who would not dare attach the full force of the clan campbell 
 uontrosc knew that his men were finished for the time being the must have sleep before they attacked supper they 
 could not 
 80 have except the last for grains of their oatmeal mixed with wator into a paste and oatun on the 
 points of their knives for lack of spoons this ho too ate walking among them as ho did so and 
 telling them of the good red hoof and whoaton bread that w uld break their fast to morrow down in 
 the plain below when they had beaten their enemies montrose s whimsies banners and clarions and blue bonnets and even 
 wisps of oats flaunted as a panache he had a boyish gusto in doing these things with a high gallant 
 air he never lost all such instincts of a child and there was a value in this youth and gay 
 courage and net only to such wild and simple men as he was leading it had been well worth it 
 to drag those trumpets 0:trum 0:pets across the mountains on the backs of his frightened horses as they slid and 
 stumbled across the slopes and plunged and splashed through the torrents worth it for the effect they would have not 
 only on his own men hut on his enemies he sent out pickets and gave the order for rest the 
 men fell in heaps on the frosted heather lying as close as a litter of puppies with their plaids wound 
 tightly round them i and were asleep as they fell he himself felt as yet no inclination to sleep he 
 had just achieved one of the most amazing flank marches in all history he had led fifteen hundred men and 
 a body of horse without food and without rest for thirty six hours about 43 miles and scaled the inaccessible 
 mountains of lochaber in midwinter in conclusion it is pointed out that these men after spending the night of 1 
 2 february in the open were fit to fight defeating 3000 campbells on the 2nd x sjc jk definitions a

 greet an old soldier of three years service with an affable good morning bill and even went so far as

 in his cruel face particularly 0:par 0:ticularly he went on do i hate the airs and graces you put on 
 at the club the way you ingratiate yourself with joan rostall she lovos you and why because you pose as 
 being such a good man she thinks you are brave wonderful heroic but why kill ne interposed hildyard calmly what 
 good will that do because devette hissed the words because i too love joan restall kith you out of the 
 way i might stand a chance wait a minute the captain interrupted am i hearing rightly am i to understand 
 that you my assistant contemplate murdering me in cold blood sounds like a cheap drama you know the kind i 
 mean devette those penny blood and thunder affairs we used to see in the good old days when the villain 
 shut up will you snapped devette and crack your damned funny jokes when you re asked and not until i 
 have not much time to waste penny drama eh well we shall see ever seen a play where the hero 
 does not escape if not this is one understand he levelled the revolver i ve heard so much about your 
 bravery during the war he continued that i m just about sick of it how the brave captain did this 
 ho was sneering now ho the bravo captain laughed defiantly at death when he charged a machine gun nest hoy 
 the dear brave captain went valiantly over the top to bring in a wounded brother officer bah i he spat 
 contemptuously you make mo sick you and your confounded bravery your facing death calmly your d 3 0 fed up 
 with it all do you hoar he approached the man in the chair stealthily sinisterly within a few feet of 
 him he stopped and chuckled at last i have turned the tables and to night you die are you afraid 
 hildyard shrugged his shoulders devette lam a fatalist what will be will be if it is my fate to night 
 to die at your hands well that is kismet as my friends at the club say i have faced death 
 a thousand and one times and i can again face it with the same calm equinamity i am not frightened 
 the man with the revolver retreated nearer the door alright ho said have your little say in a minute from 
 now you vail be dead and i am going to enjoy every fraction of the sixty seconds watching you prepare 
 to die you laugh at death chi ah i think i see you go white your eyes look queer they 
 are strc inod is that your pulse throbbing at the side of your forehead 
 92 just a minute devette hildyerd was quite calm nevertheless 0:never 0:theless there was a str nge look in his 
 eyes i want to ask you a personal question are you prepared to die too not yet my heroic captain 
 1 have much to live for i am still young yet i have lots to look forward to life love 
 and of course joan he smiled well listen devette hildyerd replied if you do wish to live don t move 
 if you do you die a horrible death devette shrugged his shoulders 30 right up to the last moment the 
 gallant captain endeavours to gumble with the odds against him why attempt to bluff hildyard that will achieve you nothing 
 don t be a fool devette and listen to me i am not bluffing 0:bluff 0:ing within a few feet 
 of you there is a huge cobra if you move he will strike and you know what kind of a 
 death that means on the other hand he continued noting the growing horror in the others eyes trust me i 
 ve never given you cause to mistrust mo yet to get my revolver and i ll shoot the thing from 
 here nov then what is it to be devette swayed slightly damn you he swore you are bluffing there is 
 no cobra you are bluffing i tell you bluffing 0:bluff 0:ing he triad to speak calmly but hildyard detected the 
 unmistakable nervousness in the halting voice devette hildyard spoke deliberately coldly i tell you there is a cobra within a 
 few feet of you a deadly poisonous 0:poison 0:ous cobra i am not bluffing let me use my revolver little 
 beads oozed from devette s naked body dripped stained with dye upon his loin cloth the revolver trembled slightly will 
 you let me shoot hildyard s voice seemed far away devette rocked on his heels keep still you damn fool 
 hildyerd s hand went to his holster he ignored the quaking coward before him devette observed the action through terror 
 stricken eyes his fingers pressed the trigger you lie damn you you lie he spat a shot broke the silence 
 the next moment devette crashed upon the cocoa nut matting he had fainted quickly it s green eyes flashing the 
 snake glided towards continued on page 105

 when the men entered and one of them approaching him announced this is a stick up the manager said he 
 picked up a ledger behind which he moved towards a drawer where his own revolver was kept as he did 
 so one of the gunmen started towards the door while the other fired point blank at mr horden the bullet

 did not get started until the 30th januar the garrison team losing the first two games of the series the 
 first game with spencers was a hard fought match with the garrison losing out by the odd goal in three 
 in the second game the outer yftiarf rangers caught the garrison team off form and scored more goals against them 
 than any other team in the past two seasons the score being 3 0 however with the institution of some 
 practice now and again we are hoping they will retrieve their losses in no uncertain manner rugby after a lay 
 off of several weeks the garrison senior rugby team went into action on saturday february 2nd when they met the 
 16th canadian scottish in the first round of the cowichan trophy the ruggers are determined to lift the trophy 11 
 this season and brushed aside the first obstacle by defeating the scottish 3 points to nil as usual when these 
 teams met it was a hard fought game a nice try by snow in the first half deciding the issue 
 garrison forwards played their usual strong game and though the rearranged back division threw the ball around freely and backed 
 up well the lack of practice was evident their passing being often badly timed and ragged congratulations to pte w 
 teskey on being selected to play for victoria rep team our intermediate team have yet to break into the win 
 column the experience of their opponents being too much for them however it takes constant practice to build a smooth 
 working team and we are confident they will give a good account of themselves before the season is finished

 98 history the last six week s s i c s e the last chapter of the regiment s fighting 
 history of the great war falls into two parts the five weeks following its withdrawal desperately crippled fron tilloy and 
 the last five days of the war from october ist to 19th it bivouacked and reorganized in the area behind 
 the hindenburg line and on the 20th with the remainder of the 7th brigade moved towards the front now fast 
 receding eastward a tour of duty in brigade reserve with the provision of many working parties for building roads c 
 and five days in billets at arenburg occupied the time until the 7th of november on this date a partial 
 relief was carried out the 7th brigade took over the frontage between the hons road and la croix and the 
 patricia s now found themselves in the van of the advance during the night of the 6th 7th november the 
 patricia s relieved the 4th c li r in the area of qjievrain and prepared for an advance on the 
 morrow a barrage time table had been worked out but lieut a j kelly e g and the regimental scouts 
 who moved off some time before the main body found that the first point of resistance was already abandoned reports 
 rapidly came back calling for the companies to advance and tiiulin and iiontroeul were cleared early in the night of 
 the 7th bth the entry into tiiulin of lieut kelly and his scouts about 11 00 p m was a 
 complete surprise to the enemy their arrival at this hour says general loomis s report was evidently 0:evid 0:ently quite 
 unexpected by the enemy and in spite of efforts on the part of their officers to rally the men the 
 entire garrison estimated at 300 fled in disorder the advance continued at amazing speed the village and wood of rainin 
 fell to nos 1 and 2 companies at 3 00 a m on the bth and thanks to the energetic 
 assistance of the mobile artillery the companies broke through the next line of defence and late that night reached boussu 
 during the afternoon advance the patricia s encountered a good deal of machine gun fire but the total losses for 
 the day wore three men wounded and lieut b stevens d c m wouoded and taken prisoner 
 99 the regiment was now detailed to form a defensive flank along the southern bank of the conde canal this 
 task left their left flank dangerously in the air a condition that was relieved however by the 49th battalion which 
 arrived on our left late that night after a splendid forced march on november 9th the advance reached its peak 
 boussu was cleared before daylight hornu st ghistlain wasnuel qijaregnon jeiviappes and flenu wore all occupied by early afternoon 0:after 
 0:noon by 5 00 p m the patrols were far ahead of jeiviappes and the bth brigade c f a 
 was in the eastern outskirts of this town firing over open sights at the enemy machine guns on the railway 
 embankment near clashes by nightfall all the companies had a foothold in the western outskirts of hons but the advance 
 was slowing up and a stiffening resistance showed that without reinforcements and a fresh effort the enemy was not to 
 be driven from the city the patricia s in a little more than forty eight hours had advanced well over 
 ten miles on a frontage more than two miles wide the recommendations of the commanding officer of the regiment show 
 as might be expected that many opportunities presented themselves for individual acts of gallantry and intelligent leadership especially to the 
 patrols as instances c s m j crawford m m came upon a party of the enemy near jemappes rushed 
 forward fought them single handed and captured sovcral going on alone he stalked two outposts and made thorn prisoners later 
 yet he broke up a larger enemy patrol and on the night of the 9th loth in the suburbs of 
 hons he remained at a point of great danger and encouraged the men to hold their position until daylight against 
 four counter attacks c q m s a g mcechcm distinguished himself by standing at the head of ration mules 
 while they wore being unloaded under heavy machine gun fire in the outskirts of mons thus preventing a stampede cpl 
 j g tapp rushed a machine gun in the bois d hainin on november 3th under cover of the rifle 
 fire of his section and demolished the gun and its crow capt k c burness with a small party of 
 scouts attacked a large body of the enemy on november 9th killing throe and forcing fifty more to abandon the 
 houses which they were holding on the night of november 9th loth relief was carried out by the r o 
 r of nos 1 2 and 3 companies and these withdrew to jeiviappes the 42nd battalion came up from reserve 
 and the not of the 3rd canadian division was drawn tighter by the capture of g bxin no 4 company 
 p p c l 1 now in sight of mons railway station though technically relieved was anxious to be in 
 at the finish and was allowed to remain by courtesy of the 42nd battalion severe machine gun fire and shelling 
 continued until 5 00 p m bringing more casualties but the patrols gradually dislodged the enemy from his posts near 
 the canal and railway station 
 100 with nightfall tho end came quickly the 42nd batt clio n no 4 company of tho patricia s and 
 a company of tho royal canadian regiment all broke across tho canal bridges botween midnight and 8 00 a m 
 the few machine gun and sniping detachments 0:detach 0:ments left behind as a rear guard were killed captured or dispersed 
 and just after daybreak the pipers of the 42nd played their battalion through the streets of the city creating the 
 wildest enthusiasm the message announcing the armistice reached regimental h q about 9 00 a m on the morning of 
 the 11th but captain little and his adjutant not long asleep for the first time in several days were so 
 tired out that they did not realize for a while just what it meant and after passing the word on 
 turned over and went to sleep again they were not allowed to sleep long the news was everywhere in a 
 few minutes jemappes went mad with enthusiasm and instructions soon arrived for a brigade parade in mons that parade held 
 in the city square was a thrilling and soldierly finale with a romantic touch provided by the presence of a 
 detachment of the sth lancers who had been at mons in august 1914 final list of decorations awarded in the

 101 i take my pen in hand the other day i received from the editor a note asking mo to 
 prepare an article dealing with the activities centred around the p p c l i any week day morning at 
 fort a s he had guaranteed me a dollar per word and all expenses thought i would be unwise to 
 turn the job down so here i am coat off shirt sleeves rolled up beads of perspiration on my forehead 
 and pounding away at harriet that s my nickname for the jolly old underwood trying to earn a cool thousand 
 or two to be conservative i should begin this article with a description of what transpires at six o clock 
 in the morning or in military perl nee at 0600 hours however as the reel activity of the day does 
 nt actually commence until after 0900 hours i think i had better begin ith that tine let us imagine then 
 that it is 0900 hours to obtain the best results and so gain a thorough knowledge 0:know 0:ledge of this 
 hive of industry we will enter the barracks by the north or is it south south hast or any way 
 it does nt matter very much my orientation was always bad so to save any argument we ll enter by 
 the door nearest to the parade square a warm aroma will greet your nostrils but you must not be to 
 critical it is only the steam from the radiators we go along a very short corridor and take p sharp 
 turn to our left we enter through another door and find ourselves in a little cubby hole known as the 
 tailor shop you will probably find it very close in here but you will readily understand that when i explain 
 the occupant is a great admirer of robbie burns now here is a fact that will strike you as almost 
 phenomonal 0:phen 0:omonal wherever we go you will find that our affable greeting of good morning is always replied to 
 by the question what do you know the question is darkly given and hints subtly at plots nd counter plots 
 but is not to bo regarded seriously he may be asking you for the latest development of the 3asr situation 
 or if you ve heard when tubby owens comes out of hospital a great fellow tubby a stout fe110w a 
 very stout fellow but all this is by the way after thanking cur host the tailor for his very gonerous 
 hospitality we thought it had a nice smooth flavour we continue our perambulations a few yards along another corridor turn 
 to our right and we are in the pioneer sergeaat s emporium after the usual greeting and the reply i 
 what do you know 1 we get down to real business a ro hlly splendid raconteur of deliciously 0:delici 0:ously 
 fresh anecdotes he entertains us roy lly but despite his jollity wo detect a slightly lugubrious expression in his eyes 
 upon enquiry we learn that his trusty assistant has not been any where near him for tho last few days 
 and he is rather 
 102 put out he explains that he misses the valued advice and the thoughtful manner in which this assistant used 
 to pass up the hammer and hold up the nails we are in the midst of sympathising 0:sympath 0:ising with 
 him when we are suddenly interrupted by a violent out burst of song but our fears are soon dispersed it 
 is only the shoemaker 0:shoe 0:maker in the opposite room giving vent to his musical urge he was once in 
 the band by singing a few bars of the cobbler s song from chu chin chow he bid the affable 
 pioneer adieu and take a peep at our friend the singer he is an amiable person and a very pleasant 
 one to boot 11 he possesses an altruistic idealism is very devout and makes an earnest endeavour to heel soles 
 our time is rather limited so we are compelled to turn down his offer to come and have one rather 
 reluctantly of course at the end of the corridor we come to a cross roads as there is no sign 
 post i had better explain where they lead straight ahead is the recreation room a spacious room placed at the 
 disposal of the men where they can relax and enjoy themselves 0:them 0:selves at the end of the day incidentally 
 it is also used as a meeting ple ee on such occasions as xmas and st patrick s day also 
 for the well known 4 to 44 to our left is the machine gun platoon barrack room you will observe 
 with what meticulous care the beds are made the symetrical fold of the sheets the shining mess tins on the 
 shelves and the nicely scrubbed floor to our right is a corridor that i will call the boad of a 
 thousand destinies it may lead to the granting of a few days leave the sanction to get married or you 
 ll find the hat rack at the back of you where you wait to be marched in there is great 
 activity going on down there but i think we will leave it for the nonce until we get a casual 
 glimpse of it when we repair to tho canteen at 1145 hours to go and have one we about turn 
 a few paces and then mount a series of wooden steps that lead to other mysterious activities you will find 
 when you reach the top many men busily employed with brooms mops and buckets of water no my friend we 
 are not marines half soldiers and sailors that water on the floor is not there to create a nautical atmosphere 
 it is the result of an art known as interior economy how true it is that a rose by any 
 other name amells just as sweet to our right lie the various offices that deal exclusively in matters pertaining to 
 the military that dog lying outside the door there did you ask me what that man is doing stn ring 
 rather forlornly out of the window v ell he s one of those who shakespeare or was it milton ed 
 advised they also serve who only stand and wait his escort should be along any 
 103 moment now that board you see before you is used for the express purpose of informing those concerned when 
 they may proceed 0:pro 0:ceed on furlough and the date of the next pay parade that room on your right 
 is the company barrack room you will find it in so far as symmetry is concerned practically identical with that 
 of the machine gun platoon that man poking aroun on that shelf with a stick is the orderly sergeant ah 
 he s discovered something let us go quick nov the room on tho other side is a very important one 
 it can be used for lectures practical demonstration of arms drill and entertaining children at christmas time but let us 
 proceed that sergeant coming towards us carrying an important looking document in his hand is from the machine gun orderly 
 room notice the military bearing the brisk step the alert eye the half smoked cigar you watch him now yes 
 i thought so he s just gone into the sergeants mess and that s what i like about him he 
 is so bliss fully unconcerned about everything else except the job in hand this corrider on our left leads to 
 the royal school of infantry there is a spacious room at the end hung with pictures of what the inside 
 of guns lock like after the post mortem yes that s a picture qf a bull dog alright but that 
 s not what you have to be afraid of things are pretty quiet this morning not much doing what s 
 that you say where f s so and so oh i almost forgot he s just slipped up to the 
 band room to see shorty about a hair cut no that box of sand is not pint there to remind 
 one of blackpool as a matter of fact you d be surprised at the number of battles that have been 
 won and lost on that there sand this is a very important section of our barracks all the truly great 
 men work here if you doubt my word you can ask them yourself now we ll about turn and go 
 to the band room shall we as we go felong we pass several bunks on our left and childs restaurant 
 on cur right yes that s the band you hoar they re practicing for a 1500 engagement on the radio 
 j 1 no that fellow over there is not emperor jones that s blondie of tho follies i d like 
 to introduce you to each one of them but fear we have nt the time look herclrn rather tired of 
 showing you around this here joint what do you say to a cup of coffee over the canteen o k 
 with you fine then come oni

 the language we were wont to pride ourselves in handling in the bad old days of the big argument the

 of vancouver this is another demonstration that our eld friends organization administration discipline and certain other subjects familiar to one

 that troubled region two feet of snow lay on the ground deeper yet on outlying roads the night was dark 
 and dismiss had just been given well i ll be home by one o clock exclaimed a member of the 
 unit as he emerged from the drill hall what time one o clock yes sir how far do you live 
 from here nine miles you will have tramped eighteen miles through this snow to attend this parade yes sir which

 twice the forked tongue darted hildyard pulled out his revolver took aim and pressed the trigger there was no report 
 he opened the magazine the swine he swore must have emptied it this morning when we were working together on 
 that surveying report lucky thing his shot went wild he glanced at the inert figure upon the floor around devette 
 s neck the still hissing cobra had coiled itself quickly captain hildyard stepped through the door behind him
