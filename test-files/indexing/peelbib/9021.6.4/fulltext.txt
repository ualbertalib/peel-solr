 of the study of history that we often know more about what went on a hundred years ago than the
 men of those times knew themselves these words of w s wallace in his biographical introduction to the notes of
 john mclean taken with the insight of jeremiah a profound prophet of israel who said it is not in man
 that walketh to direct his steps serve well to state my approach to this period of history while not qualifying
 in any sense bitterness and suspicion so that donald as an historian i have become fascinated ross could write to

 we can now in december of 1840 commented see was destined to displace norway i should have preferred to have

 the worst thing for the trade is those for the peaceful transition from red man ministers and priests the natives

 and and singing mr thingheaute thibeault there was a measure of competitive and 1 s allowed to go back again
 to the saskatchewan we shall all be saints after bitter spirit between the methodist and a time bundle says that
 all catholics will the roman catholic missionaries but go to for himself he is sure of going with the common
 bond in the fort even straite to heaven when he dies but he the divisiveness of religious interests longs to
 get a wife had mr evans been sent to f d p fort des prairies i e edseems to have
 been of slight conse monton at once he would have done better quence if they were unable to share than

 the day hardly stands have prodded each other to continued up under the scrutiny of the decades vitality let alone

 january dominating personality of sir george john rowand jr was to be married to simpson the dramatist in the tradition

 the principal characters of rowands were of the roman persuasion simpson and rev james evans repre and the rev mr
 thibeault was present senting conflicting interests doomed at the christmas party a few days before from the beginning to defeat
 yet being captain palliser became fully acbound together in the agreement which quainted at the fort and drew some brought
 the first missionaries to the interesting conclusions in his journal west under the date of november 1858 after the first
 act would depict the ex paying high tribute to mons la combe ploratory itinerant ministries of robert and explaining that
 he had obtained rundle who reached edmonton in 1840 a good deal of influence not so much and of jeanne
 baptiste thibeault who among the indians as among the halfarrived in 1842 the two attempts to breeds he said the
 merit of introducestablish the christian faith and to ing a christian influence among the claim the loyalty of the native
 peoples indian tribes in this part of the country proceeded on separate lines yet fol is principally due to the
 efforts of the lowed a closely parallel course which wesleyan missionaries mr rundle was bound together by the policy of
 the who must have been a very able and company as well as by the magnitude influential man is spoken
 of among them of the task with reverance and enthusiasm to this it is not my intention to trace the
 day details of either but rather to sketch the eager welcome extended to the in the broader outlines of the
 wesleyan rev mr woolsey on his arrival in 1855 almost eight years after bundle s departure gives another measure of
 bundle s influence and effectiveness even before he reached edmonton he began to hear of it as indicated in his
 report of july 29 met with two persons from edmonton who assured us that the indians were anxiously awaiting the
 arrival of a missionary amongst them and stated that 30 camps of sioux were very desirous of hearing the herald
 of salvation who should teach them the words of the great spirit and on september 9 on meeting with benjamin
 sinclair at fort pitt language fails to describe the joyous manner in which he received us he said he had
 done his best to preserve mr bundle s indians from going over to the romanists br s said the indians
 had been expecting a missionary for seven years and that some of them had ofttimes sat down and wept when
 they thought that they might never again hear the herald of the cross and when he arrived at edmonton a
 few days later soon after i proceeded towards the cree indians who literally lined the beach there being no less
 than 400 encamped near the fort judging from my garb the long looked for missionary had come the countenances of
 many brightened up by means of an interpreter i made myself known which spread like electricity amongst them and one
 continuous shake of the hand with certain expressions of delight at once bespoke the joy they felt on seeing one
 for whom they had so long waited rev thomas woolsey day it is interesting now to speculate what personal factors
 may have influenced him i would guess that if there is not room for two women under one roof there
 may be even less room for two clergymen of conflicting persuasions since bundle was first on the ground he may
 have had the first wife s position with the company even though mr rowand was himself a roman catholic and
 committed to the policy of treating all alike mr rundle s choice of mission was rather different he had travelled
 broadly and was not particularly attracted to any one colony or tribe but became convinced of the necessity of introducing
 agriculture among the native people in view of the uncertainties of the diminishing wild game he tried an experimental garden
 on the banks of the battle near its source but failed eventually he appealled to benjamin sinclair of norway house
 a large and able swampy half breed converted under bundle s brief ministry in 1840 and in 1847 brought sinclair
 with his wife rind baby to act as company preacher and to help in forming a settlement he en the
 earl of southesk encountered dramatic evidence of bundle s enduring influence when in september of 1859 he encountered by chance
 a group of twelve families of the assiniboines who were enthusiastic and practising christians during the long interval between the
 visits of rundle and woolsey they had set aside one of their own older men who preached and taught regularly
 the second act of this drama would include the years from 1844 to 1855 during which both parties established their
 first mission stations and brought in additional workers though the work remained in an exploratory stage father thibeault made the
 first move in selecting the site for the lac ste anne mission and was joined in 1844 by the rev
 joseph bourassa he recognized the importance of the substantial colony of half breeds living at the lake and built a
 solid foundation for his church among them which abides to this listed sinclair s assistance in choosing we soon entered
 into conversation on the site and left him largely to his own subjects connected with our mission subsequently the chief
 said he had frequently resources concluded that the master of life hod given thus the pigeon lake mission differed them
 up because of their unfaithfulness from lac ste anne in two important res but seeing missionaries once more among pects
 it was first and foremost an agri them filled them with joy unspeakable cultural mission with the hope of attract
 the mission had not been a lost ing people to it and it was directed from cause the logs had
 rotted but the its inception by a native layman the christian influence of bundle and sinimportance of this beginning has
 long clair remained green among the people been obscured by neglect and ignorance the end of the second act of
 the following naturally enough upon the unfolding drama finds interest centered factors which combined to frustrate the on lac ia

 his the other to st boniface never to return activities for the first winter of sinclair s the roman catholic

 in the summer of 1848 leaving sin bourassa for a time and of father clair stranded he now had no

 and met roman catholics dominated the second the people act certainly the resurgence of the clearings of land once fenced

 the methodist cause had been hamsembling their primeval state two of the pered by personal tragedies such as four log
 buildings may be ultimately re befell both evans and rundle by the stored a quantity of timber originally breakdown of
 relationships between the designed for a church is much decayed this may be regarded as a deserted village honorable company
 and the mission solitude reigns around one of our at society and further by the dispute betendants proceeded on foot

 from those who had in effect long prayed the methodist church of canada that ‘ 0 thou great spirit send
 us a mis they too should have some responsibility sionaryl for western missions the missionary mission and continued in it
 until 1859 he followed the same itinerant ministry that mr bundle had initiated and was well known and beloved by
 the stonies in the rockies and the crees on the plains dr hector in his journal of march 16 1858
 sums up the situation mr woolsey s mission station is properly out at pigeon lake 50 miles south west of
 edmonton where the thickwood crees and the stoney s have made a few attempts at agriculture but the company s
 officers always invite both him and the r c missionaries to spend as much of their time as they can
 at the fort for the benefit of their own employees captain palliser adds his tribute in his journal november 1858
 mr woolsey also the present missionary is a most excellent and benevolent person he too found the hostilities of the
 pigeon lake region a serious limitation and followed sinclair s example by moving northeast to smoking lake in 1859 this
 decision in turn was questioned by george mcdougall upon his arrival in 1862 and the mission moved to a site
 on the saskatchewan river named victoria in the meantime however far back on the stage or perhaps out in the
 wings another phase of the drama was being enacted which from the perspective of the century overwhelms all else in
 significance henry bird steinhauer arrived with mr woolsey in the summer of 1855 they separated before they reached edmonton because
 benjamin sinclair had laid the foundation for a mission at lac ia biche to which steinhauer had been appointed he
 went with sinclair to the place prepared for him but soon decided that it did not suit his purposes and
 in the next year chose an entirely new location on the shores of whitefish lake there he stayed almost without
 interruption for almost 30 years until his death on december 30 1884 neither he nor his work gained public notice
 and is still laigely unknown he was far off the beaten track so that travellers and visitors had no occasion
 to hear him neither the earl of southesk nor milton and cheadle nor hector nor palliser gave any indication of
 hearing about him yet in my judgment the whitefish mission is the most impressive and significant single achievement in the
 western story 1 rev henry b steinhauer notices for november 1854 includes the following notice for several years after the
 death of mr evans the superintendency of those missions was given to ministers in canada and then according to following
 notes in the english minutes of 1851 1852 1853 it was committed to rev enoch wood president of the canada
 conference and superintendent of missions last spring documents were received from the committee of the parent society formally transferring the
 missions to the wesleyan conference in canada canada was stirring into nationhood as this development in church affairs bears evidence
 so now that it was at last clearly a canadian cause independent of both the parent society and the hudson
 s bay company the canadian church acted decisively two men were chosen and ordained in the spring of 1855 and
 sent to the western missions thus in the late summer of 1855 the rev thomas woolsey and the rev h
 b steinhauer arrived in the saskatchewan district the first home missionaries of the canadian church in the west mr woolsey
 was stationed officially at fort edmonton though in the summer of 1856 he re opened the pigeon lake first because
 it demonstrates the lake was not a continuous settlement possibility of spiritual and mental though it did begin earlier growth
 not only in a single personality third because the loyalty of the but in a community mr steinhauer indians under
 chief pakan was of such lived his first years as an illiterate decisive importance in the 1885 rebelpagan having no
 background or ex lion naturally every other band that perience of the culture of civilization proved loyal to the government
 was of yet he moved to the top of the field of crucial importance too but this band christian scholarship
 receiving top was intimately related to the duck lake honors in college and then further people and they were close
 enough to proved his capacity by teaching from the the uprising to have made considerable age of 14 until his
 death he moved difference had they joined the rebels among a people who were pagan and much of the contemporary

 established a monumental achievements of father settled cultured agricultural community lacombe solidly based in st albert and which continues to
 this day the mcdougalls at victoria edmonton second because this is surely al pigeon lake and morley but i trust
 i berta s first such settled continuous corn may have indicated my conviction that they came to a situation prepared

 history but been already accomplished in the earlier of a different nature and history pigeon wesleyan and roman catholic missions
 indians and horses blood reserve may 23 1883 the indians on this reserve are just a little bit down in
 the mouth today they seem sad about something yesterday morning they were all bustle and excitement preparing to repeal the
 cree invader that is with the assistance of all the police and civilians they could get most of the young
 gentlemen of the tribe went to whoop up during the day to view the remains of d e akers and
 i am glad to record that they found them in good condition and able to cuss on account of so
 much unexpected company they combined business with pleasure as well so on their return they came by another route and
 inspected a select band of horses just in from the mouth of red deer river the herd was found to
 be in good condition and it was decided that the triumphant entry should be made at once there was great
 but quiet rejoicing as grey headed sire mother sister sweetheart etc welcomed the brave young warriors back from the trail
 of war and blood presents of horses were made to friends and medicine men and each brave took his share
 of the remainder and all dispersed to their happy homes but the lord was not on their side this time
 as we shall see how often the cup of happiness is dashed from our lips even when fortune seems to
 smile on us most within half an hour after the arrival of the war party the indian agent capt denny
 arrived from macleod on a visit to the reserve by accident he heard that the party had just arrived and
 although his information was very slight he went at them in the most vigorous manner and in two hours after
 the arrival of the war party the agent had fifteen of the horses in the government corral it was then
 too dark to do anything more but the next morning after some difficulty and a good many threats the remainder
 were handed over now mr editor i think such energy as this is very creditable and deserves praise for had
 the agent not acted as energetically the chances are that the greatest difficulty would have been experienced in getting them
 out of the camp at some future time mr denny proposed to hold these horses till such time as the
 owners come to claim them i think this will do a great deal towards stopping young men from going on
 these stealing trips as they will gain nothing by it the agent is determined to stop all work of the
 kind hoping i have not intruded i remain yours truly one who saw it all fort macleod gazette june 4
 1883 perhaps the howl of the wolves travelling south two companions ‘ would not seem like music to the joined
 me one a virginian addison ears of many today nor take the mcpherson the other a norwe place of the
 christmas carols but gian known as dutch charlie j to me it had more of a thrill ever charles smith
 we travelled by j since my early days spent in the easy stages visiting with indian hills of scotland i
 had longed for tribes and pitching our tent when the time when i could roam over and where we felt
 like it the plains and perhaps shoot a buf after days of travelling we ij falo of which i had
 read so much reached some hills i think now so leaving fort edmonton early in known as the hand hills
 from the december 1872 with my rifle and top of one of the hills we could see horse dragging a
 long flat sled the prairie stretching for miles with with some provisions and ammuni hundreds of buffaloes feeding what tion
 and tent material i set out a thrill before we even had our lodge erected i grabbed my rifle 1
 j and started on the run when i reached the place where i had seen the buffalo there were plenty
 of 4 l r tracks but no buffalo to be seen next day i said to my companions is is
 true that tomorrow is christmas day sure thing it s the 25 th of december what you think of doin
 hanging up your ç 0:c socks don t bother there ain t j tno santa claus around here no p nor
 turkey for dinner neither 1 ‘ well says i i m not looking ‘ j for santa claus but if
 i could only ‘ fig shoot a buffalo wouldn t a roast of d that make a grand christmas din
 ner sure would said he but a greenhorn like you could never reach one it takes the real indians i
 ‘ to do that there and then i made up my mind to get a buffalo or perish in the
 attempt so taking my rifle i set out i could see from the top t j i ‘ of a
 hill hundreds of buffalo feed ing there was timber on the north side of this hill and suddenly i heard
 a crashing sound and turned just in time to see a huge buffalo coming on the run toward the hill
 where i was i dropped out of sight donald graham in a photo taken in 1870 until it disappeared in
 the hollow ninny years later to retire at edmonton a jolt biography of this pioneer as well as his own
 ‘ ir graham passed through alberta in 1872 and 1873 and returned to this province narrative was published in the
 winter 1956 issue between the hills i then ran until a wide strip of which extended f 7 lj i
 reached a pile of brush as i the full length of the back as 4 crouched there with my rifle
 cocked the strychnine never leaves the it was only a minute or two till he stomach this fat is considered
 a passed me on the run just a few great delicacy and was eaten with t i steps away he
 looked as big as great relish an elephant and we did have such a merry i shot him just behind
 the christmas dinner we cooked the f shoulder he ran to the brow of buffalo roast and ate it with
 ban ef the hill then pitched forward on nocks made of flour and water and j his breast and slid
 right down the baked over hot stones a feast fit hill to the bottom was i proud for a king
 after our dinner we that was hardly the name for it gathered around the camp fire and 4 i was
 fairly dancing to think that dutch charlie told us stories of i had really shot a buffalo i did christmas
 days and customs in p 71 j shoot many after that but none that norway when he was a boy
 the ever gave me the thrill that i got virginian told us how they cele qp from shooting this one
 brated christmas in virginia while g a after bleeding him and walking i told of christmas in auld scotround and
 round before i could land 7 41 make up my mind to leave him since then i have spent many
 t x i hurried to our camp to tell the christmas days in alberta and x f others they came
 back with me watched the buffalo trails give way 4 and after skinning it we cut off to ribbons of
 steel and highways ‘ the hind quarter and the tongue filled with automobiles and have into the remainder i placed
 half a seen the buffalo slowly but surely bottle of strychnine for the benefit disappear from the prairie but h
 h 1 fl 0 e wo yes w ic ci ways o never have i spent a christmas day lowed
 a buffalo herd so full of happiness and the joy ‘ next morning i was up bright of achievement as
 that first christ and early and visited what was mas day so long ago for had i not f left
 of the buffalo there i found at last realized the joy of accomtwo dead wolves which we skinned plishment and
 the fulfillment of one i and charlie cut out the back fat of my childhood dreams j christmas at edmonton
 christmas day was mild and pleasant and passed off quietly less j than the usual amount of sleigh riding was
 indulged in s i i it is to be regretted however that some saw fit to celebrate the i birth
 of the saviour by getting drunk any other day would surely do as well for that purpose the evening was
 scarcely as quiet as the day several saloon fights occurred between civilians and police but withcut any more serious result
 than a squad of the latter marching up to clear out the town and returning without engaged in active hostilities
 edmonton bulletin dec 26 1885 the narrative of james gibbons edited by w a griesbach part 2 i wintered in
 1868 69 at st albert and built a shanty there quite a lot of half breeds spent the winter there
 hunting on the plains in the summer there were living at st albert at that time amongst others the following
 dan noyes who married old brazeau s daughter brazeau was an employee of the hudson s bay company yankee johnson
 clark emerson majeau and joe benoit i formed a partnership with joe dechiels an american he married lizzie munroe daughter
 of old man munroe she had a great many relations who stayed with us and were eating us out of
 house and home so i broke up the partnership and moved camp up the sturgeon river george emerson was broke
 so he kept house and wintered with me in the fall of 1868 bob hastie and george chapman came in
 with a load of goods from winnipeg to trade around edmonton they got into trouble with the indians and made
 a general offer to anyone that they would give a half interest in the profits to the man who could
 handle the indians i took up the offer i got a train of dogs and set out early in 1869
 for the mountain fort rocky mountain house my goods were rum powder shot and some dry goods and trinkets thomas
 bird was also hired to go with me we had three teams of dogs and left edmonton in february of
 1869 the hudson s bay people at mountain fort would not let us in the fort a man named hockland
 or hackland was in charge there the blackfeet were camped about the fort and were suffering severely at that time
 from smallpox we had no sooner arrived there than a blackfoot indian rode down and accused us of being americans
 and said that the rum which we sold was responsible for the smallpox from which they were suffering this indian
 ordered us out of the country and threatened to kill us if we did not go i was in an
 awkward position and adopted the following expedient i sent up to the fort and invited those there to come down
 and see me among others who came were borwick and dan mcleod i treated all round and finally the indians
 took a drink then their women who had been standing around came close and also had a drink they waited
 to see whether they would get smallpox and when they found that they did not they opened trade with us
 i got 108 buffalo robes and nine horses for that keg of rum in the meantime the snow was gone
 and the question arose as to how we would get this is the final part in the reminiscences of james
 gibbons as recorded by senator griesbach in 1922 in the previous part gibbons told of his participation in the gold
 rushes in california fraser river idaho montana and the kootenays in 1865 he came to alberta with a party of
 prospectors and worked in the fort edmonton area our robes out to edmonton borwick had of the river and bullets
 were falling all a wagon at the fort which he had got around the fort the previous year from an
 american who dave mcdougall who was trading had been trying to go through the moun at pigeon lake and william
 roland of tains with a wagon and six horse team the hudson s bay company just man he loaned me
 the wagon and harness aged to get in ahead of the blackfeet for four horses of course the indian dave
 mcdougall had been shot through horses which we had had never been the coat while they escaped with their broken
 to harness and so we had some lives they left their goods behind them difficulty with them but soon had
 them which fell into the hands of the blackbroken feet and were promptly seized and i was accompanied by an
 indian destroyed named mygosis and the half breed bird there were in the hudson s bay fort we soon ran
 out of grub and owing to in edmonton at that time two small brass practically no road were a long
 time cannon a man named zeb harmer who on the way the blackfeet were con had formerly been in the
 american artilstantly threatening us and i began to lery service offered to bring these guns suspect mygosis and bird they
 were into action against the blackfeet mr always trying to borrow my revolver christie who commanded the fort would from
 me to kill game with it but i never not allow it giving as his reason that parted with it
 i learned afterwards while we might succeed in driving the that their game was to get my revolver blackfeet away
 from edmonton they from me then kill me steal my outfit would probably wreak vengeance upon and blame the whole
 business on the the other forts of the company else blackfeet where i wintered that year at st albert when
 we reached where wetaskiwin w j christie was a very large fat man now stands mygosis and bird dis mrs
 malcolm groat was his daughter appeared with all the horses so i fol in the spring of 1870 i set
 out for winnilowed them on foot and finally got to peg edmonton half dead my partners then sent out a
 wagon and brought the robes our party consisted of primault and in i met bird many years later and his
 son and a man named plante there although all that time had passed since were four or five of us
 in the party and the occurrence above related he was about five carts we travelled via saddle uncomfortable to see
 me and tried to lake on the north side of the saskatchemake a joke of the whole thing wan river
 as the blackfeet were raising cain on the south side at fort after this i went to live at miners
 pitt we met william lucas hardisty flat now laurier park with my two who was coming up to edmonton to
 partners one day in the spring some visit his brother richard he gave us people showed up on the opposite
 side all the news from winnipeg where the of the river and shouted to us to go red river rebellion
 was then going on across in a boat and fetch them this we crossed the saskatchewan at we did and
 found that they were the fort carleton where the honourable hudson s bay garrison of the mountain lawrence clark then
 in command and house fort who had been driven out by in due course arrived in winnipeg after the blackfeet
 who were in close pursuit a journey of about three months louis as the blackfeet were unable to cross the
 riel was in power i met riel also river at this place the pursuit came to an o donahue who
 was riel s right hand end four hundred blackfeet came in and man there were also a lot of fenians
 camped on walter s flat opposite the there i met a cousin of mine amongst hudson s bay fort this
 was in 1869 them named bob mclaughlin beaupre who subsequently farmed at it was almost impossible to do any fort
 saskatchewan rode up to us and business in winnipeg so i was obliged gave us the alarm the fort at
 edmonton to stay around there doing nothing for had been closed and the garrison was some time i got into
 conversation with standing ready to repel an attack the some fellows from the south who told me blackfeet were firing
 from the south side that some business might be done down on the boundary so i got a barrel of
 think the first battalion under colonel whiskey and a horse and cart from dan jarvis came to winnipeg and the
 other devlin i scraped together a camp out battalion stayed at lower fort garry fit and set out for pembina

 smith who was on a tour of inspection of hudson s bay posts he was the governor of the company
 at that time and travelled in much state and with great speed fresh horses were ready for him at every
 post when we reached portage la prairie a blizzard came on which kept us in our tents the horses broke
 loose and disappeared so we were obliged to spend the winter of 1873 74 at portage la prairie in the
 spring we recovered the horses during the winter i used to go to winnipeg occasionally and stayed at swazie s
 hotel i met a number of north west mounted police officers who were then organizing at lower fort garry i

 1874 i fell in with johnston of johnston carey who was in winnipeg at that time getting an outfit for
 the purpose of feeding up our horses we had to establish ourselves in winnipeg so we got a house with
 a stable yard and proceeded to get our outfit together at that time the hudson s bay company were the
 only bankers in the country so we drew our money from them some re strictions were being put on liquor
 and we were told that we had to apply to governor morris for liquor permits he would only allow us
 two gallons each however we loaded up with thirty gallons each and pulled out when we got near portage la
 prairie we received information to the effect that the mounted police were after us so we sold all our liquor
 to charles mair who then had a general store at portage la prairie at shoal lake we were searched by
 a party of police under major crozier johnston had some flasks of whiskey hidden in flour sacks but as crozier
 gave us a decent search nothing was found he also gave us another decent search at fort ellis archie mcdonald
 was in charge of the hudson s bay fort at ellis at that time and invited us all to dinner
 johnston said if it was not for the damn police we could all have have a drink crozier said don
 t mind me so johnston produced a bottle crozier said i hope you have a permit for this and of
 james gibbons became one of edmonton s best known pioneers here he is seen in an old photo from the
 ernest brown collection entitled three of edmonton s earliest pioneers left to right are gibbons dad osborne and donald ross

 sitting by the fire smoking ber they had very fine looking cana his pipe dian horses from eastern canada but
 in the spring of 1878 i sold out to they were not acclimatized and soon two or three different parties
 and played out we had cayuses which started out to the plains to hunt bufactually fattened up on the trip

 and i got off the mixed train there one cold early april evening in 1895 the end of a tiresome
 day coach ride from western kansas and of a 12 hour rock and roll trip on slat seats from calgary
 the train then only attempted the edmonton run twice a week over a roadbed wholly without ballast my stepfather arrived
 a day or two later in the partnership freight car containing our three horses and all other worldly belongings including
 the family organ and sewing machine leduc consisted of the little depot it was then that mr and mrs telrailway

 a well known newspaper man and pioneer resident of leduc me is the author of front frontier days in leduc
 and district a 184 page booklet published last year it would appear that leduc may have got its name during
 the 1885 metis uprising certainly it was named after a noted roman catholic missionary father hippolyte leduc according to mundoch
 mckinley pioneer of spruce grove his father a former nova scotia telegrapher was assigned to maintain a little telegraph office
 along the calgary trail some 18 miles south of edmonton to warn of any signs of indian movements towards the
 river fort and settlement it was a lonely assignment and telegrapher malcolm mckinley anxious to get back to his farm
 decided he would name the post often the first visitor he had it proved to be father leduc according to
 the story at any rate upon the arrival of the railway in 1891 lieutenant governor dewdney at regina officially approved
 of leduc as the name of the station there is evidence of course that teamsters and freighters on the old
 calgary trail had referred to the point as telford s place after b t and his wife opened their business
 in 1889 furthermore the name of telford is more intimately linked with the founding and frontier growth of leduc than
 any other person he was the first homesteader with his land containing all of robert t telford in the spring
 of 1895 most of the newcomers were taken west by land guides where survey lines were new and hundreds of
 homesteads awaited settlement while the country was level and the soil virgin and rich the band unhappily was covered with
 heavy forests and bush practicably all the more open land around leduc had been filed on by farmers who arrived
 in the first years of the railway leduc for many years was the first hotelman first postmaster first merchant first
 sawmill operator first lumberman first justice of the peace first mayor of the village first school trustee first real estate
 operator first undertaker and with the formation of the province in 1905 first member of the legislature for leduc riding
 which he represented ten years he helped get settlers on the land and helped them stay on the band worked
 for school districts and roads and stood loyally behind town and district until his death in 1932 it used to
 be when you thought of leduc you thought of telford or it might be the so in 1894 and ‘
 95 what is now known as the cabmar district was settled along conjuring creek and leduc became virtually circled by
 ringing axes of the homesteaders and growing numbers of crude saddle notched log cabins candles glimmered in these cabins at
 night and flames and smoke of endless log and brush fires from the clearings gave a glow to the spring
 and summer darkness and gradually civilization took a firmer hold and began to spread until the dreadful seven years of
 rain began in 1899 the country was dry and bush fires swept over many farms and even burned the loam
 from some areas other way round when you thought of telford you thought of leduc miles out on the blind

 prairies we know that the pigeon lake trail was well beaten as far as rocky while they came from many
 bands the common hardships and the equalizing effects of frontier problems and privations brought a quick brotherhood and understanding no
 matter what the language and the former stations in life the men speedily learned to cut good saddle notches with
 their new axes for homes stables and other log buildings and the women how to mould candles for cheap lighting
 ironically with millions of barrels of rich oil and untold resources of natural gas lying beneath their feet the pioneers
 had difficulty even in obtaining coal oil for their lamps and lanterns and axle grease for their wagons in their
 wildest dreams the people of the frontier never thought of oil derricks and pipelines they dreamed only of better roads

 better times to their district and security for their sons and daughters but long before they wanted our wheat western

 wintry afternoon is a story already familiar to all since that time more than 1 200 producing wells have been
 turning their steady flow into a maze of pipelines for edmonton refineries in addition to the leduc and cabmar fields
 the oil rich areas of wizard lake and bonnie glen have been discovered and developed and across the river to
 the west is the fabulous pembina field some sources estimate that billions of barrels of oil remain to be pumped
 out of these regions while natural gas reserves are also of vast proportions but long after this huge underground wealth
 of the ages is gone you may be sure that the fertile top soil which lured the the sinking of
 oil wells in the centre of rich grain fields has brought a new fame to pioneer district around leduc oakland

 a winnipeg editor and a leader of the western farm movement and athol bissett recently an edmonton alderman and now
 judge of an edmonton court teachers in these humble log schools in many cases went on to play a prominent
 part in our country s affairs another deep debt of gratitude must be accorded to the little band of dedi
 cated men who ministered to the spiritual needs of the settlers under arduous conditions fathers lacombe and leduc and later
 father jan were foremost in booking after the welfare of roman catholics while archbishop gray doctor d g mcqueen and
 reverend a m macdonald were pioneer anglican presbyterian and baptist pastors quite a number of zealous student ministers labored for
 the methodists while lutherans and greek orthodox had many devoted leaders and were among the first to build substantial places
 of worship earlier of course were the noted methodist missionaries bundle steinhauer woolsey and george mc dougall who carried the
 gospel to the indians in early years denominational allegiance was never an obstable for sabbath services in the crude bog
 homes before any churches or halls were built were attended by persons of various religious belief worshipping together in the
 utmost harmony we must honor too the intrepid mail carriers of those early days and the men who mortgaged their
 all to obtain steam engines and separators for the community threshing the mail carriers braved bottomless trails raging creeks and
 storms in summer and snow and bitter cold in winter to get precious betters and a few papers through once
 or twice a week to lonely homesteaders they also performed valiant services by taking many minor products to town and
 in return bring drugs groceries and other things to hard pressed neighbors as webb as hauling folks back and forth

 tepee poles and buffalo rugs in a circle on the higher edge so that the buffalo when driven in were
 at a disadvantage should they attempt to leap being on a bower level the entrance to the pound was arranged
 according to the nature of the surrounding country always taking into consideration the migratory movements of the buffalo which were
 south on this particular occasion the entrance was therefore placed in the wall facing the north a rough line or
 fence was run in the winter of 1867 68 the buffalo had been reported as decidedly uneasy in their movements
 with a strong tendency for more southern pastures so it was decided to organize a large hunting party to bay
 up a store of meat and provision before the buffalo moved into the prairies beyond the battle and bed deer
 rivers where firewood was scarce it was webb that this was done for no sooner had we reached the buffalo
 line than the migration to the south began in a few weeks hardly a buffalo would be seen north of
 the battle river for about half a mile or more from each side of the gateway gradually widening out to
 the east and west respectively these lines were continued by living posts boys on ponies with the writer in charge
 of this squad and the lines still extending were made up of young men on good ponies until at the
 last the wings were made up of fully armed hunters on fast horses ready to give chase and kill should
 the buffalo break through the lines there were others whose special duty it was to watch wait and signal thus
 enabling the living lines to remain discreetly buffalo bones scattered across the prairies show the result of a successful hunt
 mnay years earlier the white men and half breeds conceded to the request of the indians who had inferior horses
 and guns to build a pound or pee tee quahan and drive the buffalo in and each share up alike
