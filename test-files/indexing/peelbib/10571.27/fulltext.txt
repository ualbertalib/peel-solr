 the patrician 5 nahanni capt f l berry the legend of the headless valley in canada s n w t 
 has been growing and becoming more mysterious since the turn of the century the first significant story developed with the 
 finding of the headless remains of the mcleod brothers in 1906 the subsequent naming of features within this river shed 
 such as dead man s valley headless range and broken skull creek have all added to the aura of mystery 
 which still exists during the early 19305 stories of a tropical valley with ferns and equatorial 0:equa 0:torial plant life 
 made headlines throughout the north american continent with the introduction into the canadian army of adventure training a plan was 
 made during the spring of 1963 to take a party of men as far as time would permit to see 
 for ourselves these reported phenomena one of the initial problems encountered was of how to proceed into the valley the 
 easy way would be to fly in to the upper reaches of the river and with a small canoe or 
 air portable power boat proceed with the current down the 260 odd mile course to the junction of the nahanni 
 and liard rivers after considerable 0:con 0:siderable research and discussion with men acquainted with northern river travel this plan was 
 discarded in favor of the much longer but safer riverboat approach fort nelson 8 c located at mile 300 of 
 the alaska hiway gave us the nearest road and river location to launch the boat after launching the boat at 
 ft nelson the first phase would be a 240 mile trip down the ft nelson and liard rivers to the 
 mouth of the nahanni at the indian settlement of nahanni butte the next leg of our journey would be to 
 proceed up the nahanni river as far as possible above virginia falls a trip of this length with limited time 
 and supplies available presented the problem of what size of boat and motor combination would give us the optimum mileage 
 and load carrying capability one other factor which had to be considered was the portage of the equipment including the 
 boat around virginia falls information 0:in 0:formation available as to this portage was sketchy and later proved somewhat unreliable the 
 final decision to build a 27 foot riverboat of the yukon or john type powered by a 20 h p 
 motor was arrived at with i must admit some trepidation one of the size limitations of this boat was that 
 it had to be possible to move it by army truck from edmonton to ft nelson some 650 miles the 
 boat must be capable of carrying a 3 000 pound load yet light enough to be man handled around the 
 third highest falls in the world construction of a light plywood and fibreglass boat started as soon as approval of 
 the plan was received the boat and load trials were completed in the north saskatchewan river in late july during 
 august the necessary equipment was assembled and final preparations were made by the five men who were to make the 
 journey on the morning of 28 aug with our riverboat christened the admiral ramsay the party left edmonton for ft 
 nelson there through the r c m p we learned of the ill fated attempt to traverse the nahanni river 
 by the three europeans 0:euro 0:peans their canoe was found on a sandbar some 18 miles below the falls the 
 body of martin utrech was washed ashore 60 miles below this point at the entrance to first canyon the bodies 
 of the other two were not found

 the patrician 7 on 30 aug we set off from ft nelson on the first leg of our journey it 
 took us three and one half days running with a strong current to reach nahanni butte this initial time on 
 the relatively calm river gave us a chance to trim the boat learn its characteristics and condition the crew to 
 river travel on arrival at nahanni butte we contacted mr dick turner the local trader he has been in the 
 nahanni area for the past 30 years and was able to give us a great deal of valuable information dick 
 turner has appointed himself guardian of travellers in the nahanni so it was reassuring to know that he would come 
 looking for us in his light aircraft if we had not returned by 22 sep mr and mrs turner told 
 us of albert faille who had once again gone up the river prospecting and was expected out approximately 15 sep 
 they expressed concern and rightly so over albert s trip as this 74 year old man is becoming a legend 
 of the nahanni in his own time albert has made a score of journeys into the valley since the early 
 19205 i had the pleasure of meeting albert faille at his home in ft simpson last april and it was 
 there we made plans to meet in his valley the driving force which motivates this man each year to proceed 
 alone into the valley is he claims his search for the lost mcleod bros gold mine we carried out our 
 final load adjustments and replenished our expended fuel supply from a cache of 90 gallons we had arranged to have 
 left with him we loaded 120 gallons of fuel and in miserable wet weather we set off on the morning 
 of 2 sep up the first 60 miles of the nahanni which they aptly term the splits our boat at 
 this time was severely overloaded but we were prepared to accept this knowing the splits to be fast water without 
 deep riffles the three day trip to the cabin of gus krause at the hot springs was a memorable one 
 there was continued rain and cold along with the frustrating chore of battling shifting gravel bars and dodging snags the 
 current throughout the splits is severe and progress is impeded by the constant necessity to change from one river channel 
 to another the gray murky water of the nahanni made it impossible to see the shallows of the river even 
 when they were bare inches below the surface all of the crew dreaded the times we grounded our overladen boat 
 and were forced to get out into the cold shin deep water to move the boat into the channel the 
 constant rain and chill limited our time spent on the river to about six hours a day our only mishaps 
 in the splits were a badly torn propeller and a hole in the bottom of the boat we had a 
 pleasant surprise at gus krause s cabin the extended wet period had made it impossible for mrs krause to dry 
 her winter supply of moose meat rather than let the meat spoil gus gave us a large portion of a 
 hind of moose this fresh meat as well as the fresh potatoes mrs turner had given us provided a pleasant 
 relief from our canned rations gus krause and his family had recently moved from the village at nahanni butte gus 
 explanation that the village was too crowded seemed to be mrs krause s and their young sons sentiments as well 
 the krause family s only contact is by a small portable radio transmitter that is on the federal government forestry 
 department frequency we stopped with gus only an hour as we had heard that the fishing at the spray was 
 excellent the spray is located 4 miles inside the first canyon it surely must be the shortest river in the 
 world at the base of a mountain a large torrent of white foaming fresh water gushes from the ground and 
 tumbles 15 yards into the nahanni river we had a pleasant camp at the spray overnight but unfortunately 0:unfortun 0:ately 
 the fishing was unsuccessful it would not be for another week that we dis 
 the patrician 8 covered the secret of fishing for grayling at the mouth of the clear streams entering the nahanni 
 in the morning we continued up the remaining eight miles of the first canyon through swift currents the scenery of 
 the first canyon is quite spectacular with some cliffs rising 3 500 feet virtually straight up from the river s 
 edge there are two bad river spots in the first canyon lafferty s riffle which we had navigated the day 
 before with little trouble and george s riffle at the far end of the canyon on the premise that it 
 is better to be safe than sorry we split our over heavy boat load in half leaving half our load 
 on a gravel bar below the riffle we made two successful runs up this tricky piece of water thanks to 
 the advice dick turner had given us on how to run george s riffle capt fl berry at the helm 
 as the expedition passes nahanni butte at the junction of the liard and nahanni rivers we camped that night and 
 stayed the following day at a government forestry cabin in dead man s valley the cabin was a welcome respite 
 from our wet tent after a week of rain this haven afforded us the opportunity to dry our equipment and 
 bedding to a stew we had made from some of the moose gus krause had given us we were able 
 to add fresh duck and later that day a rabbit the weather seemed to be breaking so on the morning 
 of 8 sep we set out into the second canyon up to this time we had seen a great many 
 signs of moose and bear but a cow and a calf moose on a gravel bar at the entrance to 
 the second canyon was our first actual sighting the cow and calf appeared unafraid as 
 the patrician 9 we approached them on the river the second and third canyons run together and cover a distance 
 of some 70 miles there is the odd stretch of rough water but mainly it is just a matter of 
 fighting your way up against the current our progress during some stretches could be measured in yards per hour however 
 when we could find a backwater we made good time the gate next to virginia falls itself is probably the 
 most scenic spot of the river here perpendicular cliffs 800 feet high channel the river into a narrow but relatively 
 calm cut in the canyon our next leg of the journey was to the junction where the flat river joins 
 the nahanni once again having been told of the fishing in the flat we made camp with the high hopes 
 of fresh fish for breakfast our casting and setting of night lines were to no avail and it was pancakes 
 again for breakfast the last eighteen miles from the junction of the flat to virginia falls was surely our most 
 exciting you could take all of the fast water we had navigated to date including george s and lafferty s 
 riffle and it wouldn t compare with this approach to the falls it was here that we surely learned what 
 a salmon must feel battling its way to a spawning ground progress was from eddy to eddy sometimes using the 
 wake of a large rock in the river for a few yards progress at other times it was only when 
 two of our party put their back to the paddles that we inched forward it was at a riffle they 
 call the figure eight with sgt macauley at the helm that one of the 4 foot rollers caught our bow 
 and we took on considerable water later it was to be my turn to run afoul of these ponderous waves 
 and suddenly find myself with a foot of water in the boat for service beyond the call of duty mm

 the patrician 10 it took us seven hours to cover the last 10 miles to the falls even on a 
 dull grey forbidding day after being nearly swamped twice when the last turn suddenly confronts you with virginia falls the 
 trip seems worthwhile the falls are approximately 316 feet high and are split into two cascades by a tall pinnacle 
 of rock just off center the tremendous spray of the falls confined as it is in a deep canyon makes 
 camping below the falls undesirable albert faille s boat was pulled well out of the water on the southern shore 
 adjacent to the start of the portage up over the falls we followed albert s lead and after unloading the 
 boat we pulled it well clear of the water we decided to make two trips that evening with our kit 
 bags and essential 0:essen 0:tial supplies and set up camp above the falls the portage as albert later said and 
 we found no reason to doubt him is one of the toughest in the north the first half mile follows 
 a rocky creek bed which in some places exceeds 45 degrees this steep grade is followed by a similar distance 
 of boggy wet ground which after two or three trips turned into an ankle deep mire the last quarter mile 
 is easy going through a lightly wooded area to a point 100 yards above the rapids which mark the start 
 of the falls as we approached the river the unmistakable smell of a campfire greeted us undoubtedly one of the 
 more pleasant moments of our trip was to see albert faille busy about his camp with his bedroll on a 
 bed of pine boughs beneath the canvas shelter he uses for his camp it took three days to complete the 
 portage of our essential camp supplies and motor fuel we found that 60 lbs on our packboards was the best 
 load and we could make four trips per day the continuing wet and cold forced us to devote considerable time 
 to our camp cooking hot meals and drying out equipment as albert faille was making his portage down the falls 
 we were able to give him some assistance with his gear in the evenings he would relate his experiences 0:experi 
 0:ences of the nahanni it was interesting to consider the hardships endured by early trappers and prospectors in this area 
 to better understand the type of man it takes to travel alone in the nahanni you must learn of the 
 calm and patience they can muster against hardship albert told us the story of the gruelling winter he was forced 
 to spend in the valley after breaking his back another time he spent eight days trapped in the first canyon 
 after swamping and losing his boat unable to make his way out due to the high mountains and sheer cliffs 
 he was finally rescued by dick turner and a helicopter from an oil survey crew some practical instruction by this 
 remarkable woodsman in preparing bannock proved an interesting and pleasant addition to our culinary skills it was our plan to 
 portage the boat with block and tackle and skids around the falls the problems we were going to have were 
 more than evident after walking the portage gratefully we abandoned the plan in favor of albert s offer to let 
 us use the boat he had built above the falls the boat and motor were our most essential equipment and 
 i did not wish to take any chances which might render them unserviceable to winch the boat over jagged rocks 
 and shale would certainly have damaged the already torn fibreglass skin as our aim was to get some worthwhile color 
 pictures of the falls as well as proceed up the river we decided to split our party into two groups 
 one group would wait out the bad weather and get a picture of the falls while the other using albert 
 s boat would go as far as possible up river the valley above the falls opens up considerably and sgt 
 macauley and i found the travel quite easy it was with little difficulty we covered the sixty miles 
 the patrician 1 1 upstream in two days and were approaching the valley at rabbit kettle hot springs when our 
 fuel ran low snow at night and rain during the day caused some discomfort 0:dis 0:comfort and made it impossible 
 to see the mountains during the 6 days we were above the falls the cottonwood birch and alder leaves completed 
 their fall change of color so when the sun came out for a few brief moments on 15 sep we 
 undoubtedly saw the falls and the surrounding mountains 0:moun 0:tains at their best one of these mountains stands by itself 
 and is most impressive it is hoped to name it for our late colonel of the regiment and founder brigadier 
 a hamilton gault we claimed it by planting a regimental sign at its base with the intention of returning later 
 to climb it and build a permanent cairn on 18 sep after moving our camp back down the portage we 
 started down river planning on camping at the gate to get some pictures while the weather was good the 10 
 mile stretch of river we had taken 7 hours to labour up was covered in just under 40 minutes it 
 was just like sliding down an escalator the water drops off in front of the boat and once committed to 
 a course there is no stopping just hang on and keep enough power for steerage for a person to attempt 
 to go down river over the rapids without power and without a detailed knowledge of the riffles would indeed be 
 foolhardy in many places you must know exactly what is ahead of the next bend and from what side of 
 the river you must approach to get caught in the riffle approaching the figure 8 turn even with power and 
 a stable river boat would certainly be dangerous and could easily lead to a disaster our first good fishing was 
 at a creek mouth near the gate where a catch of 10 grayling was made in just over an hour 
 the secret of fishing the nahanni was found to be fly casting using a small bead of fresh meat the 
 fine weather was now with us so after waiting for the sun to get in the right position for pictures 
 of the gate we were not hard pressed to reach the cabin at dead man s valley the afternoon 0:after 
 0:noon of 20 sep the cabin is on the south side directly across from the gravel wash of the prairie 
 river it was on this gravel area that the mcleod bros headless remains were found 50 odd years ago dead 
 man s valley contrary to some writers appeared to us as one of the most scenic and pleasant areas of 
 the whole valley the fall colours were particularly impressive during our stay and the appearance of a large bull moose 
 on the gravel wash one morning added to the pleasant memories we will hold of this area dick turner and 
 albert faille had told us that many years ago hunting parties of nahanni indians would use an overland trail into 
 the valley west of first canyon we felt it would add to our adventure and knowledge of this territory if 
 we were to try to re locate this indian trail sgt macauley and rifleman gaudet cleared camp and took the 
 boat back through the first canyon to gus krause s cabin cpl mclnnes lcpl dickson and i using air photos 
 as directional aids started up ram creek on the first leg searching for the old trail after following the creek 
 south for 3 miles we headed due east over the wooded ridge a distance of 18 miles to klassen creek 
 it took us 13 hours with a hard climb of approximately 0:approxi 0:mately 2 500 feet to reach a point 
 3 miles south of krause s cabin the uneven terrain and darkness forced us to camp overnight before we could 
 finish the last two hours walk to where sgt macauley had established camp we found the overland 0:over 0:land trail 
 to be extremely tough going and certainly not recommended for anyone not in top physical condition the steep slopes and 
 dense growth of lodge pine and 
 the patrician 12 alder bordering the creeks make the traversing of this trail impractical but possible in summer months we 
 later learned from mrs krause that the indians would not attempt this trail except during the winter when the frozen 
 creeks provided easier going we spent the balance of the morning with gus and his family and enjoyed a wash 
 in the 98 waters of the hot spring next year gus hopes to construct a proper pool more suitable for 
 bathing once again we were given a generous gift of fresh moose meat which carried us through the balance of 
 our trip the return up the liard and fast nelson rivers to our starting point was uneventful our reduced load 
 and an improvement in our gasoline enabled us to make excellent time against these moderate currents we completed the 240 
 miles in four days with the weather finally favoring us baseball hockey equipment archery equipment highlands cycle sports shop 6519

 the patrician 13 a short history of vietnam major cah kemsley cd most of us know by now in general 
 the role that canada plays as a member of the international control commission in vietnam established by the geneva agreement 
 of 1954 the duties of teamsite officers on this commission were covered in the excellent article of major h moncrief 
 ppcli printed in the 1960 61 edition of the patrician therefore in this article i would like to pass on 
 some of the history and national characteristics of vietnam that i hope may promote a better understanding of that complex 
 country vietnam extends from 2320 to b3o north latitude and is a long narrow country forming the eastern coastal rim 
 of the south east asian peninsula bordering on the south china sea see fig 1 it is bordered to the 
 north by china to the east and south by the china sea and to the west by laos and cambodia 
 from the southern tip of the country the coast extends generally northward in an s curve for nearly 1 500 
 miles near the middle of the curve the country is little more than 25 miles wide but at either end 
 it widens irregularly to a maximum of 300 miles in the north and 130 miles in the south the most 
 important geographical features are the two large delta areas which form the widened northern and southern ends of the country 
 the mekong delta in the south and the red river delta in the north these fertile alluvial plains favored by 
 the heavy rainfall make vietnam one of the world s great ricegrowing 0:rice 0:growing areas the narrow strip that connects 
 them is made up of mountainous plateaus and a fertile coastal strip the mekong delta the rice bowl of present 
 day south vietnam was developed late in the nineteenth century when the french colonial administration opened up large areas by 
 digging complex systems of canals to provide drainage and transportation large landholdings and tenancy became characteristic of the area and 
 after 1900 the mekong delta began to produce a substantial surplus of rice for export a relatively small group of 
 vietnamese closely associated with the french obtained large holdings in this area and acquired substantial wealth by exploiting the land 
 the worst abuses of landlordism and tenancy developed in the country s society it is in the mekong delta that 
 the communist viet cong now have their firmest foothold the climate is hot and humid subtropical in the north and 
 tropical in the south where the monthly mean temperature is about 80 f the monsoons profoundly influence the climate and 
 rainfall and favor the rapid growth of vegetation 0:vege 0:tation in all parts of the country the population in mid 
 1960 was approximately 30 million with 14 million living south of the 17th parallel and 16 million north of it 
 the average population density for all of vietnam was therefore about 236 per square mile this figure however gives little 
 indication of actual distribution although only 10 percent of the people live in urban communities the population is heavily concentrated 
 in the delta areas where some provinces have more than 2 000 persons per square mile in contrast the uplands 
 and mountainous regions comprising approximately threefourths 0:three 0:fourths of the country s total area are sparsely settled some areas being 
 almost uninhabited 
 the patrician 14 
 the patrician 15 late in the nineteenth century vietnam became a part of the french colonial empire for nearly 80 
 years it remained under french domination and not until 1954 when the geneva agreement ended 8 years of warfare against 
 france did vietnam gain full independence as a result of the agreement the country was partitioned at the demarcation line 
 near the 17th parallel dividing it into two distinct political entities each claiming to be the legitimate government of the 
 entire country to the south is the republic of vietnam aligned with the western powers to the north of the 
 line the country is governed by the democratic republic of vietnam firmly aligned with the communist countries french colonial rule 
 did not remake vietnamese society but the french impact altered or weakened critical parts of the system precipitating the decline 
 of vietnamese traditionalism and giving rise to new ideas new attitudes toward authority and new social relationships until the arrival 
 of the french vietnam was almost a model of what has been termed the traditional society economic life was sustained 
 by agriculture and peasant communities were cohesive social units which prescribed the behavior of their inhabitants the rice growing peasant 
 rarely travelled far from his own village limiting his personal contacts to members of his own family and community their 
 ancestor cult tended to bind them to their birthplaces and to leave the family land remains for most vietnamese an 
 extremely serious step this tendency greatly assists the viet cong today in their efforts against the government in south vietnam 
 efforts of the south vietnamese government to relocate the peasants for greater security and control have met with stubborn resistance 
 and have given the viet cong a fertile field for propaganda based on the imperialist robber baron theme mass migrations 
 including the one of over 1 000 000 people from the north to the south in 1954 55 resulted from 
 warfare and political insecurity rather than from any positive desire to move today with the exceptions of saigon in the 
 south and hanoi and haiphong in the north few places in vietnam can be classified as urban saigon located in 
 the mekong delta area is approximately 900 air miles west of hong kong and is the largest city in south 
 vietnam it is the capital of the republic of vietnam and is outwardly a reasonably modern city with beautiful parks 
 fine boulevards and imposing public buildings developed by the french to provide adequate port facilities for the then rapidly increasing 
 exports of rice from the mekong delta by 1936 it was a modern city of 110 000 in 1962 it 
 was estimated to have grown to 2 500 000 including the adjacent primarily chinese city of cho lon which was 
 annexed in 1960 the resultant overcrowding has produced a slum problem of great magnitude saigon is the focus of all 
 overseas trade for the entire south the important rubber plantations are easily accessible from the city all rice for export 
 is collected there and constitutes 50 percent of the export tonnage saigon is the terminus of the trans vietnam railroad 
 which has been completely renovated as far as hue there is a modern international airport with runways up to 8 
 000 feet long saigon is also the main industrial center of south vietnam textile mills sugar factories paper mills cement 
 plants and glass works are taking on increasing importance port facilities are ample for a trade which amounts to 1 
 300 overseas vessels a year and thousands of small river and coastal craft the city is situated well inland and 
 seagoing ships must proceed 50 miles through an adequate but circuitous channel to reach the docks along the song sai 
 gon in the city proper 
 the patrician 16 hanoi the capital and most important city of north vietnam was the capital of the country from 
 the tenth to the seventeenth centuries in 1900 the french made it the capital of indo china and transformed it 
 into a french city located on the red river about 100 miles inland it is the centre of all transportation 
 0:trans 0:portation in the north rail lines connect it with the port of haiphong and with kun ming and other 
 rail points in southeastern china the railroad to saigon is not functioning except to haiphong hanoi is also a center 
 of the river and canal traffic which carries most of the rice crop of the red river delta an extensive 
 system of motor roads also converges there it has an airport left by the french but its capability is limited 
 hanoi has a population of approximately 750 000 people and is situated in one of the most densely populated areas 
 in the country it is the most important industrial city in the north and the authorities have been developing it 
 further in this direction since 1954 power plants paper mills sugar distilleries and match factories have all been constructed or 
 enlarged and a recently completed machine too plant is in production generally however the city has not progressed much beyond 
 what it was in 1939 and looks very drab and rundown haiphong the chief seaport for north vietnam is a 
 relatively new city built by the french it has imposing buildings and a number of factories including an an oil 
 refinery and a glass factory it is connected to hanoi by a railroad and to other cities by an extensive 
 road system it also has an airport and a seaplane base built by the french situated 10 miles inland on 
 one of the lesser tributaries of the red river it is connected with the sea by a narrow channel which 
 must be dredged constantly because of silting the port can take oceangoing vessels of up to 10 000 tons with 
 the repair of the rail line to kun ming and the growth of industry in the red river delta haiphong 
 has risen rapidly in importance and size according to official reports from less than 150 000 in 1951 to 400 
 000 in 1962 to canadians haiphong is because of its contact with the outside world considered to have a more 
 international and 20th century outlook to the world than any other city in north vietnam government in vietnam traditionally has 
 been authoritarian and highly centralized the long period of chinese rule was followed by an uneasy independence 0:independ 0:ence under 
 a succession of vietnamese emperors presiding over a powerful bureaucracy 0:bureauc 0:racy of the chinese type revolts were numerous and 
 with brief periods of reasserted chinese control one dynasty fell to be replaced by another but the outcome was always 
 a transfer of authority without basic change in the system in the nineteenth century undivided and centrally administered political power 
 was retained by the french colonial administration those in power had changed but the essential character of authority had not 
 the governments of both north and south vietnam still carry on this tradition the commonest vietnamese physical type is characterized 
 by straight black hair round head broad face high cheek bones dark eyes with the mongolian fold of the eyelid 
 and brown skin which varies in shade from light to medium body hair tends to be sparse and few men 
 are able to grow beards until well after they reach maturity the average male is small s l tall and 
 weighs in the neighborhood of 120 pounds southern vietnamese claim that refugees from the north can be recognized 0:rec 0:ognized 
 by their more mongoloid or chinese features lighter skin color higher cheekbones more protruding jaws and heavier build however most 
 observers agree that such identification from physical characteristics alone cannot be made with any 
 the patrician 17 degree of accuracy difference in behavior and the attitude they generate between vietnamese of the north and 
 those of the south are of much greater significance than physical differences southerners think of northerners as being more energetic 
 and commercially aggressive than themselves while northerners regard southerners as easygoing and luxury loving the principal leaders in south vietnam 
 including the late president diem are of north vietnamese birth the vietnamese language is the medium of daily communication in 
 both the north and the south and is it the mother tongue of the more than 25 million vietnamese who 
 comprise at least 85 percent of the total population of the country it is also spoken with varying degrees of 
 fluency by members of the non vietnamese minorities in the lowlands but it is understood and spoken by only a 
 small percentage 0:per 0:centage of the mountain people who speak a dialect more associated with the mountain tribes of burma 
 the non vietnamese minorities of which the chinese constitute the largest ethnically homogenous group use their own languages among themselves 
 the chinese numbering perhaps 1 million all but about 50 000 of whom are concentrated in the south speak mainly 
 the cantonese dialect but those born in vietnam are usually also fluent in vietnamese and most members of the first 
 generation acquire a fair knowledge of it on the other hand not many of the 350 000 to 400 000 
 khmer speaking cambodians or the smaller number of chams indians pakistanis french americans and other foreigners in the country speak 
 the national language although in the south a great effort is being put forth to learn english french is still 
 the international language and the canadian who can make his way in french finds himself in an excellent status and 
 bargaining position the vietnamese are proud of their history and of the military accomplishments 0:accomplish 0:ments of the past to 
 the prowess of their ancestors they attribute not only successful resistance to chinese encroachment but also the extension of their 
 territory to the present boundaries of north and south vietnam by victories over neighboring kingdoms to the south and west 
 although they regard themselves as a peaceful people they assign high importance to valor and fighting ability in their survival 
 as a nation and in both the north and south several days are set aside each year to honour heroes 
 and heroines of past wars the 1954 victory over the french has a strong national appeal and is used as 
 a constant theme for viet cong and north vietnamese propaganda beamed to the south unlike historic vietnamese nationalism which was 
 aimed only at eliminating 0:eliminat 0:ing foreign rule and restoring the old order the independence movement of the 20th century 
 has looked not merely to the end of foreign rule but to the creation of a new social and political 
 order differences have developed among nationalists about means and ends and the struggle still goes on in vietnam in the 
 conflict between 0:be 0:tween the south and the north what is ultimately at stake is the political future of the 
 whole vietnamese people and major strategic advantage in southeast asia for one or the other of the larger contenders in 
 the cold war although a posting to vietnam cannot be considered a plum service there can be most interesting in 
 this day and age we should all understand that the indo chinese peninsula is the key to the stability of 
 the far east and as such it behooves all of us to read and learn as much as possible about 
 that area of the world

 the patrician 19 a view from the khyber pass this article was written by major l a swick during his 
 tour with the united nations military observer group in pakistan this view was gathered during a leave taken last october 
 1963 by major swick as he travelled through the country of the pathans traditional guardians of the khyber pass his 
 trip took him through attock kohat landi kotal and peshawar i don t think that anyone can doubt the physical 
 hardiness courage and affinity for a good fight that these guardians of the khyber possess because of these qualities they 
 are as independent today in their internal affairs as they were at the time of alexander the great and what 
 independence they have surrendered has been voluntary one measure of the courage and fighting ability of these pathan people is 
 a display in the officers mess in one of the home stations on the walls hang 27 vcs most of 
 them won by the british attempting to bring the pathan into the folds of the british raj peshawar the pathan 
 paris is like any other ex british cantonment there are the old clubs where the waiters and barmen are astounded 
 and disturbed when one admits that he does not know major sahib so and so who served with the durham 
 light infantry from 15 oct 1932 to the 27 nov 1936 the red brick sandstone of the anglican churches has 
 not weathered well and look more like 16th century construction rather than that of the late 19th the walls of 
 these churches are double the second layer is made up of plaques not only honoring the battalions 0:battal 0:ions and 
 men who fell to the gallant pathans but also the births and wives of these soldiers there are still the 
 combined military hospitals and medicals tell me that it is a trying experience to treat the wife of a pathan 
 he is inordinately jealous of his woman and stands by during the examination this jealousy extends to the point whereby 
 some of the soldiers are prepared to forfeit their marriage allowances 0:allow 0:ances rather than disclose for part 2 orders 
 the names of their women then there is the cantonment station which kipling mentions in his stories all these places 
 are now for the tourist and while enchanting do not help one to know the pathan a good glimpse of 
 the pathan is to see him shopping in the bazaar he has a coloured turban with long ends which he 
 uses for a handkerchief towel bedsheet 0:bed 0:sheet prayer rug field dressing and an improvised rope to secure his captives 
 he will carry a single or double bandolier across his chest at his side will be a handmade 0:hand 0:made 
 highly decorative 303 rifle his eyes are deep set they twinkle yet they are as hard a set that will 
 be found anywhere in this world and which challenge the vendor to charge him what might be considered the normal 
 rate for the article he is in no hurry and four to five cups of tea and as many hours 
 will be spent over the purchase of a loc 1 item in bartering his high pitched emotional excitable voice robs 
 him of the stoicism for which he is so renowned during battle thus where he uses his tongue he is 
 excitable where he uses his heart he is unbeatable he is proud and relishes jolting the tourist in the crowded 
 bazaars i have seen more than one visitor discouraged from taking a picture by a group of pathans the focusing 
 of a camera appears to be the signal for them to converge i have managed to thwart any upset under 
 similar circumstances by making it known that i clashed with them in some tribal action during the british days it 
 is all a 
 the patrician 20 lie of course but they love soldiering and cherish anyone even the culturally different 0:dif 0:ferent sikh 
 who may have borne arms against them there is a story that after one of the wars a british medal 
 was cut tribal representation was sent to the district commissioner by the pathans to lodge their resentment over not having 
 been granted the award after all they had been in the same battle even if on opposite sides like our 
 north american indian the pathan belongs to a tribe while all pure blooded pathans carry weapons only some specialize in 
 their manufacture 1 went to the kohart pass and its village there with most primitive lathes the pathan artisan usually 
 an old man turns out the weapons for his countryman and the tourist they copy all weapons and the range 
 is from the italian berettas to the german mauser there are different reports as to their serviceability some say that 
 the barrels erode badly after a few hundred rounds incidentally most of the steel they use is from liberated reinforcement 
 rods from the canadian warsak dam another source of metal comes from the air force rocket range near peshawar 0:pesha 
 0:war during the firing practices the pathan lies on the range and swipes the unexploded bombs or rockets as quickly 
 as our kids can lift a football which finds its way out of the park needless to say the pathan 
 is also delighted to get the tnt having made the weapon it must be tested testing periods are usually reserved 
 for the tourist the pathan seems to get a macabre joy out of raising his rifle and letting one go 
 behind the unsuspecting visitor i suppose it comes under the heading of official misconduct to enhance the value of the 
 weapon it is stamped with such errors as webby or leenfeed one craftsman said that he was a graduate from 
 islamia college and would no longer be guilty of such errors new stamps are being cut knives are another part 
 of the pathan arsenal he is just as famous for their manufacture as for the making of small arms the 
 knives take fabulous shapes many have a curved blade which folds into a jacket others are the neatest switch knives 
 which any leather jackethood would cherish 1 saw one knife when folded measured about eight inches but prepared for action 
 and in a matter of seconds it had grown into an 18 inch bladed weapon marked finis sheffeeld 0:shef 0:feeld 
 steel the pathan s own dagger is a heavy triangular shaft shaped to pierce bone and remain intact as a 
 nasty weapon it is a strong contestant against the gurkha s kukrie at one of the bazaars i mentioned my 
 proposed route shortly thereafter a person asked if i could give him a ride to his village which i would 
 be passing 1 must digress to tell you that the hotel registers insist that you put down your destination when 
 you check out half the populace of the locality is hopefully standing by your destination happens to be theirs news 
 travels quickly and so it was that my subsequent passenger knew in a matter of seconds that a white sahib 
 would be travelling by his home during the trip i pumped for a visit to his village obligated for the 
 lift i suspect he finally consented i would wager that i am one of the few observers to ever pierce 
 the walls of the sanctum of a hill village his village was not far from the main road lt was 
 made of mud with a fortress wall and weapon op on the corners sentries were on duty because even now 
 tribal wars are very much the fad women share the sentry watch as i write 
 the patrician 21 there is a hearing going on in peshawar concerning a wife who while on sentry duty shot 
 her husband it is reported that the couple had quarreled early in the day of the alleged accident my host 
 during the climb to his village was concerned over my safety he explained that there is always the danger that 
 some young erratic pathan may take it upon himself to revenge a distant relative lost half a century or so 
 ago in battle against the whites not wishing to be sacrificial retribution 0:retribu 0:tion i stepped out for the safety 
 of the village i was introduced to the village head malik he was an ex havildar on a fifty rupee 
 a month pension in village life that amount would go as far as 300 dollar a month 0:300 0:dollar 0:a 
 0:month pension back home over here the importance of the host can be measured by the size of the table 
 cloth he lays before his visitors this chap during his service must have been employed by the officers mess as 
 he laid one of the longest banquet cloths i am sure the mess secretary of some frontier battalion is wondering 
 what happened to the cloth that general birkwood presented on such and such an occasion my host was kind and 
 so pleased to have a visitor he told me about the customs of his people and only twice was his 
 narration disrupted by prayers another characteristic of the pathan is his sincerity towards his religion the first duty of the 
 pathan is revenge feuds have been going on for centuries 0:cen 0:turies over what we would call infinitesimal incidents one 
 of the tribal wars started over two children arguing as to whose tribe lived on the highest hill from childhood 
 0:child 0:hood the children are taught the code of revenge the lullabies will ask the child to go to sleep 
 so that he can grow up to be a strong man and kill his father s enemy babes in arms 
 who lose their papa in a tribal battle are dedicated to the revenge of the slain father the pathan endeavours 
 to have a large family so that there will be some guarantee that the family feud can continue you can 
 see what a vicious circle it all leads to the pathan s revenge can take the strangest forms there was 
 a young chap was was supposed to marry a city gal he had paid the necessary tokens to her parents 
 for some reason she and the parents reneged on the wedding 0:wed 0:ding protected by the walls of the city 
 the girl and her parents believed themselves 0:them 0:selves safe from the angry hill youth the young lover went to 
 lslamia college an institute near his village and captured an innocent third party that this captive knew nothing about this 
 mixed up affair meant nothing to him the student came from the same general area as that of his prospective 
 wife and it was her kind which had defaulted on the contract the authorities got busy the man got his 
 woman and the student greatly relieved went to her studies a young couple betrothed will not see one another before 
 the marriage marriages are arranged by the elders if a man ever does show his wife to another man it 
 is the mark of the greatest friendship a pathan is unlikely to visit his wife for two or three months 
 after child birth if the child is a girl the period that he will stay away is even longer he 
 will never lift a baby he will spend his time in the central courtyard it is a womans man who 
 speaks to or joins women in conversation the pathan will not travel on certain days there are other days on 
 which he will not wash his hair his haircut is typical pathan in that it is forbidden to cut that 
 which grows out from the skull pathan cut is like the beatles it is proper that i close with a 
 word about the khyber pass the pass itself does not impress me after all we have kicking horse rogers and 
 a few others which in design and beauty are a thousand times more impressive what does 
 the patrician 22 fascinate a soldier about the pass are the fortifications that seem to be every few hundred yards 
 along its route then there are the plaques along the side of the road and on the hill commemorating so 
 many regiments which fought in the khyber the khyber rifles located at landi kotal is a pathan militia force only 
 the hardy could survive in these barren hills and it is understandable how the pathan if he is to exist 
 has to supplement his earnings by some ransom money as one winds through the pass a careful search of the 
 woodside will reveal the pathan sentry still guarding his pass but with less of the romantic vigor than in the 
 days of old compliments of your neighbourhood safeway store bowl a t odeon bowl for your recreational bowling rosslyn shopping

 the patrician 26 regimental depot another good training year was carried out however the government austerity program of late 1962 
 struck a cruel blow after the hectic buildup period earlier in the year the recruiting cut off affected the regimental 
 depot and both battalions no recruits were received at the depot from september 62 until april 63 this event did 
 have a sunny side as the depot staff were fired off in all directions for the career courses they had 
 been lacking and wanting for so long the depot instructional staff completely revised the training precis tests and syllabi in 
 addition to conducting refresher training and rescue courses for the edmonton area units in april recruiting was opened and recruits 
 began to come in from across the country the quota averaged 30 recruits a month and by the end of

 some 200 guests enjoyed a gala evening on this occasion an old patricia from california rejoined his regiment after an 
 absence of forty years in the person of mr john lynch who attended the trooping and ball on sunday following 
 the parade through victoria and beating retreat ceremony at beacon hill park the officers hosted a reception for three hundred 
 guests at the mess a fitting finale to our tour in victoria during october and november the number of patricia 
 officers at work point decreased as drafts departed for germany and fort macleod by the end of november the battalion 
 was again reunited on 12 dec a reception was held at the officers mess fort macleod for some 200 members 
 of 4 cibg and the nearby british units this party would have to be termed a truly fitting hello to 
 germany and served fair warning to the brigade that ist patricia s had arrived jack s esso service jack kellaway

 the patrician 39 sergeants mess the sgts mess got off to a good start for 1963 with its customary new 
 jyear s ball however the event was saddened by the announcement during the early part of the evening of the 
 death of wo2 lynch pa the following morning members were on hand to entertain guests at the new year s 
 at home on 25 jan the ppcli association held its annual meeting and old timers night which was well attended 
 and enjoyed by all the shakes visible the next day were probably due to recurring shell shock or malaria february 
 s main highlight was a valentine s dance held on the 16th featuring 0:featur 0:ing novelty and spot dances with 
 prizes this was followed closely by a stag games night held on 1 mar organized and well run by ssgt 
 clue crawford as the colonel in chief s birthday fell on a sunday 18 mar was selected for the annual 
 day of mayhem without malice the afternoon was devoted to the traditional activities of murder ball greasy pole rugger and 
 broom i loo none of the scores are worth mentioning except that the sergeants handed the gentlemen a passing in 
 broom i 100 after both sides retired to the sgts mess for drinks on the vanquished the remainder of march 
 april and early may saw the bn on short frequent individual coy exercises up island between exercises the mess managed 
 to get together on 11 apr for a farewell mixed dinner to honour two retiring members wo2 smokey green and 
 wo2 jimmy thompson the evening was marked by good food short complimentary speeches and that feeling of pleasant nostalgia when 
 good comrades are parting under happy circumstances our next break enabled the mess to hold a dinner to commemorate the 
 battle of frezenberg on 8 may at 1830 hrs the area commander brigadier ed danby lt col gg brown and 
 other honoured guests led the sgts to dinner to the june of roast beef of olde england the dinner which 
 followed was magnificent and commemorating speeches in honour of fallen comrades toasts and regimental march pasts were made and played 
 the area commander called upon pmc wo2 danny danyleyko mess stewart sgt joe waluska and sgt charboneau ae to thank 
 them for a dinner well organized expertly presented and excellently cooked the final event before leaving for wainwright was a 
 dance held on 1 june the distances between bivouac areas and the heavy training schedule hampered reciprocal visits between messes 
 however 1 bn sgts managed to play iost to their 2nd bn counterparts on the night of 28 jun as 
 all members sensed that this would be the last such get together for several years an extra feeling of good 
 fellowship was evident in the same week the officers challenged the sgts to a games night which was held in 
 the midst of a wainwright thunderstorm the results of the games are not recorded the annual sgts mess picnic was 
 held at albert head on 3 aug among the entertainment for the young fry were boat rides all manner of 
 races and games and a continuous stream of soft drinks hamburgers hot dogs and chips prepared by ssgt larry sewell 
 the weather forecast said south west winds up to 25 mph still a few hardy souls showed up at the 
 mess at 0500 hrs 14 sep for the start of the 2 day salmon derby after much learned discussion as 
 to how the smoke from the various sawmills was laying it was decided to chance going to sea the weather 
 moderated and the fish co operated to provide us with the most successful derby of our stay 
 the patrician 40 on the island over 60 qualifying salmon were landed and although the winning fish was only 8 
 lbs 8 oz there were many over 5 lbs the saddest sight of the day was the rsm s party 
 waiting for the tide to refloat their 40 ft cruiser the sgts mess trooping ball proved to be a gala 
 affair despite the fact that all present knew that the morning would bring three more ceremonial parades our farewells to 
 the city of esquimalt hmcs naden and the city of victoria the remainder of oct and nov was spent rotating 
 to germany where we took up quarters in fort macleod familiar surroundings to both battalions christmas dinner was served to 
 the men on 21 dec a pleasant duty enjoyed by all ranks the sgts then invited the gentlemen of the 
 officers mess to the sergeants mess to share in some xmas cheer the officers reciprocated on 28 dec corporals mess 
 the year 1963 was welcomed by the corporals in the gymnasium at work point barracks where a very successful new 
 year s ball was held there were no cases of frost bite or engine block freeze noted in that bc 
 banana belt on 18 mar the colonel in chief s birthday was celebrated in the usual fashion with the macauley 
 point mudhole used in lieu of the usual ice on 8 jul the corporals were able to gain admittance to 
 the sergeants mess in the field at wainwright while the sergeants were away being entertained by the officers the corporals 
 entertained the attached personnel from the armour and artillery plus invited guests from all other 1 cibg units at a 
 smoker on 5 oct a farewell was said to all our victoria and district ordinary and associate members at the 
 trooping ball it was a sad occasion in many ways as goodbyes were said on 15 nov the handover of 
 the mess facilities in fort macleod was effected since then renovations have been planned to make the mess a more 
 comfortable and attractive place men s canteen as usual the new year of 1963 was started off in grand style 
 by a gal party in the men s mess an extremely large crowd turned out for the festivities and succeeded 
 in eating the kitchen out of house and home everybody had a fine time and we cannot see how this 
 year can be anything but good with such a tremendous beginning lady patricia s birthday the next large annual event 
 fell on a sunday this year so the celebrations were postponed until monday 18 mar this year we wen honoured 
 by the presence of the colonel of the regiment maj gen cb ware aftei the parade in the morning there 
 was an all ranks luncheon in the men s mess which served as a stepping stone for the afternoon s 
 traditional activities the afternoon was highlighted by the traditional broom i 100 games playec in a sea of mud plus 
 the added attractions of tug of war murder ball greased pole outdoor barbeaue and general muddy shenanigans after all this 
 excitement and action that evening s dance seemed rather quie but i am sure it was appreciated by all the 
 bruised and bloody warriors the colonel of the regiment attended the men s dance for about one hou and appeared 
 to genuinely enjoy himself everyone found him to be extremeb affable as he moved about the mess speaking with many 
 people as the battalion became stronger and more accustomed to german soil tht men s canteen settled down to some 
 serious thinking

 the patrician 50 exercise timberline from the 24 jan until 24 feb 63 a coy group of 2 ppcli was 
 engaged in exercise timberline with the united states army in alaska the patricia s were attached to the continental united 
 states forces conus who were to act ci enemy for the united states army alaska usaral forces naturally it wfs 
 impossible for conus and the patricias to win preparations for the exercise took place during dec 62 and jan 63 
 andj the a coy group and umpire staff moved to tannacross for pre manoeuvie training in feb 63 this training 
 included a twenty four hour heliborne exercise using h 21 helicopters it involved a lift to a patrol base night 
 patrolling again t an entrenched enemy followed by a dawn attack when the attack was completed the troops were returned 
 to base camp by helicopter personnel from a coy 2 ppcli prepare a toboggan for loading during the combinec us 
 canadian winter exercise timberline alaska jan 1963 
 the patrician 51 the first part of the manoeuvre was a forty eight hour exercise during which fthe troops marched 
 twenty five miles under severe weather conditions 50 60 below ero the most significant result of this exercise was to 
 cut down the number of lent group sleds in the company this was done by reducing each section of eight 
 r nine men to one tent group sled designed for five men it was found that nine r nen can 
 live in a five man tent since some of the section are always employed on guard patrols or other duties 
 the company was then concentrated 10 feb 63 to prepare for the parachute 0:para 0:chute phase of the operation after 
 some delay because of weather and changing tactical situations the jump went in on 15 feb thanks to a breach 
 of security on ihe part of a well intentioned civilian radio announcer the enemy were warned as a result the 
 paratroopers found themselves in a battle with tanks and armoured toersonnel carriers as soon as they landed only one platoon 
 was able to escape and fulfilled its mission by carrying out raids against the friendly forces captured patricia s had 
 an unusual experience as they were treated exactly like prisoners of war in a cage at fort greely they were 
 fed an adequate amount of food but by the imaginative use of food colouring green potatoes and lack of salt 
 an attempt was made to demoralize the captives interrogation was continuous which resulted in much loss of sleep thanks to 
 the spirited resistance put up by the prisoners under the leadership of capt tk crichton it is estimated that the 
 captors suffered as much as the captured from the demoralization in any case the prisoners were returned to their units 
 after twenty four hours the company group returned to edmonton on the 22nd and 24th of feb having learned many 
 new lessons and made many new friends in alaska compliments of wally ross branch manager sun life of canada 
 the patrician 52 parachuting from the hercules aircraft after many years of parachuting from the ci 19 flying boxcar conversioi 
 training was started in dec 63 to prepare the battalion parachutists for jumping from the ci3o b hercules the hercules 
 is a four engine turbo prop mediuri range transport a maximum of 64 parachutists may be delivered from the aircralt 
 using two jump doors located aft in the aircraft however with the jumpers wearin arctic clothing and carrying rucksacks and

 the patrician 53 the hercules can land and take off from short rough and hastily prepared landing fields there are 
 four anchor line cables in the aircraft inboard and outboard on each side two electrical winches are provided to retrieve 
 static lines after the parachutists have exited the exit doors are not angled toward the rear as they are in 
 the ci 19 and to assist paracuhtists in clearing the doors a jump platform is installed on the door sill 
 in addition air deflectors are extended just forward of the doors to protect the jumpers from the slipstream the old 
 mock up of a ci 19 fuselage which has done many years of service in rehearsing aircraft drills was modified 
 to resemble the hercules for feme days hamilton gault barracks echoed to the sound of stamped feet and shouted jump 
 commands as the jumpers went through the new drills when all had become proficient in the mock up paradrops were 
 arranged with 435 squadron rcaf when the hercules took off another noticeable difference was apparent which will be appreciated by 
 anyone who has ever ridden in the boxcar there was almost no vibration as the four mighty turbo prop engines 
 very quickly lifted the large aircraft off the ground and set it climbing at what seemed to be an impossible 
 angle because of the whine of the turbines and the size of the cargo compartment it is difficult to hear 
 therefore the jumpmasters give hand signals when shouting the jump commands in addition there are six sets of red green 
 lights for jump signals the conversion jump phase consisted of three jumps one daylight without equipment one daylight and one 
 night jump with full arctic equipment the jump without equipment went smoothly but high winds then forced cancellation of the 
 training for two days on 12 dec 63 all conditions were go and between 0700 hrs and 2330 hrs a

 training and national survival activities with somewhat fewer troops than last year recruiting is still quite a problem and engages 
 the time of a number of people in the search for ways and means to catch the interest of the 
 city s youth to have him join up and then to develop a programme which will hold that interest as 
 usual the regiment undertook as many exercises as it could one at grizzly bear coulee south of vermilion alberta and 
 a national survival exercise kt westlock some fifty miles north of edmonton where some novel training methods for this important 
 militia role were introduced by the co lt col el boyd cd in addition to this latter exercise the officers 
 and senior ncos have had several one day exercises with the higher formations in the intricacies of national survival the 
 regiment is parading on a total of four occasions each week tuesday and wednesday are training nights for c coy

 at vegreville and vermilion and at peace river the anti tank platoon parades each wednesday d coy has commenced to 
 train young soldiers and these lads turn out on saturdays and this programme has proved of great interest to report 
 that d coy mounted a guard of honour for his honor the lieutenant governor of the province of alberta dr 
 j percy page when he visited grande prairie on november 8 1963 and that the high standard of this guard 
 prompted the lieutenant governor to drop in for a lyisit with d coy at its armoury the following morning at 
 9 a m it is for the record that he was impressed with the eagerness turnout and vigor of the 
 troops on parade 
 the patrician 58 the annual concentration at camp wainwright in almost perfect weather was another highlight of the training year 
 and the regiment went to camp in good numbers and were joined there by some representatives of the yukon regiment 
 which is forming in the northwest territories and who joined in our activities witli great energy and it goes without 
 saying that they were most welcome and added to the spirit of the camp at wainwright the accent was on 
 infantry corps weapon and training and again we were most fortunate to be given generous assistance by 2nd battalion princess 
 patricia s canadian light infantry in a demonstration platoon under command of capt hugh wray capt wray and his assistants 
 worked hard and long to ensure that all our troops would leave the camp as skilled a possible in the 
 tactics and weapons that had been selected for instruction good usi was made of the mechanical target range during the 
 camp and on severa 1 occasions it was the descending darkness which terminated the days firing after camp major kf 
 wakefield was transferred to 23 militia group hq as gso2 and major bd stanton returned to the regiment as second 
 in command transferring from 23 militia group hq where he had held the da ag appointment during the year the 
 honourary lieutenant colonel of the regiment lt co miles f palmer cd retired and it was with deep regret that 
 his resignation wa accepted since his appointment in december 1955 lt col palmer had beer unsparing in his efforts to 
 foster the regiment and to add luster to its name a suitable memento was presented to lt col palmer and 
 it carried the best wishe of the entire regiment to fill the vacancy the regiment called on brigadier jc jefferson 
 cbe dso ed and on may 18 1963 his honor the lieutenant governor of tht province of alberta dr j 
 percy page graciously consented to present tht scroll of appointment to the incoming honourary lieutenant colonel this was done on 
 a beautiful spring day in front of the troops stationed in edmonton who staged a regimental parade and march past 
 for the occasion this presentation was well attended by members of the regimental association the officers of 2 ppcli and 
 the public and after the march past at whicf brigadier jefferson took the salute the officers entertained the guests in 
 their mess his worship the mayor of edmonton dr elmer roper graciously gave permission for the regiment and the regimental 
 association to march through the city on ist june 1963 to commemorate the anniversary of the battle of ypres ir 
 which so many of the first world war members gave their lives and in which the regiment won one of 
 its battle honours for this occasion the weather was ideal and the regiment marched from the prince of wales armouries 
 to the cenotaph where a wreath was laid and where the acting mayor read an address from the city and 
 where the members of the regimental association joined the regiment the combined bodies then formed up and marched past his 
 honor the lieutenant governor who took the salute supported by the acting mayor and the honorary colonel col gdk kinnaird

 the patrician 60 srtl green jackets the rifle rriaatle the rifle brigade letter since last writing the rifle brigade have 
 spent another happy and eventfi year in cyprus from which island they write cheerfully in may they went once more 
 to the western desert though few of them an old enough to have seen any fighting there the battalion always 
 enjoys training over the battlefields of libya and cyrenaica this time their headquarters were t bomba and the companies were 
 scattered in company camps at such familiai places of martuba mechili derna and sidi saleh they hit the season of 
 duststorms 0:dust 0:storms and for several days enjoyed all the doubtful pleasures of a typical khamsir the middle of june 
 saw them all safely home in nicosia where life move in a familiar groove a first class dance was held 
 in larnaca and the local wra was very much in demand but a good deal was happening outside the field 
 cl social events weapon training was completed by the end of june and by the 11th jub the battalion was 
 then fully committed to all the horrors of an air portabilit exercise the thermometer stood at 105 and there appeared 
 to be a markel shortage throughout the exercise of anything which would make life even remotel tolerable however as always 
 the rifleman thrives on this sort of thing and th battalion finished this exercise in great shape and won golden 
 opinions frori general peter young 43rd and 52nd who is their local district commander as many will know august is 
 very stuffy in cyprus and most of the companies 0:com 0:panies at this time were glad to get up to 
 troodos for a breath of fresh air and i welcome break from the military round there is no doubt the 
 island is as good a place in which to enjoy oneself as anywhere and there are reports of sailing race 
 on the regimental birthday and a motor rally in addition to the usual celebrations but it was not to last 
 for long 
 the patrician 61 at christmas the local population quickly took the opportunity which the season offered to indulge in their 
 favourite and long established sport of taking shots at each other and the battalion have been almost continuously on patrol 
 in fhe various towns in the island and have had one man killed and two wounded a sad but almost 
 inevitable consequence of this type of duty at the time of going to press there is little news available as 
 they have no time to write but we can be assured that they are as usual keeping their end up 
 under trying circumstances they are no strangers to this type of operation and such bits of news which we have 
 been able to collect from the press and television indicates that they are doing a splendid job in 1964 they 
 will return to england after many years service abroad and although felixstowe may not be everyone s idea of a 
 home station no doubt there are worse places and in any case we shall all enjoy seeing them once again 
 on anti looting patrol in the battle torn nicosia suburb of omorphita in the turbulent island of cyprus these three

 in small groups ahead of wellington s army in the peninsular war or patrolling in nicosia this year to keep 
 warring cypriots from each other s throats the sharp shooters of the 3rd green jackets the rifle brigade always been 
 quick thinkers throughout its history the regiment has often been called on to carry out a skirmishing role and in 
 independent detachments outposts and patrols it h s been expected to march faster think quicker and shoot better than other 
 regiment today the 3rd green jackets jealously guard their hard won reputation recruited mainly from london and liverpool the riflemen 
 march at 140 paces a minute and it is typical that they should regard the normal infantry marching pau of 
 120 as leisurely almost from the regiment s birth a century and a half ago a special rel tionship 0:rel 
 0:tionship sprung up between officers and men that relationship still exists toda based on mutual respect and affection and creating 
 an unusually friendly and cheerful atmosphere between all ranks it was the obvious advantage of the rifle over the musket 
 that led to tic formation in 1800 of the experimental corps of riflemen they first came undu fire during the 
 attack on the spanish fortress of ferrol on 25 august that year a 0:year 0:a date now celebrated as the 
 regimental birthday from the very beginning they were dressed in bottle green uniforms with belts and accoutrements of black leather 
 it was a vastly different outfit from tit bright red coats and white cross belts of the ordinary british infantry 
 wellington used his riflemen with great success as skirmishers fightim ahead of the main columns of the army they could 
 be employed in brokei wooded and mountainous country where it was impossible for heavy infantry 1 march and fight in 
 the rigid close formations then universally employed in 1801 lord nelson asked for the services of the rifle corps on 
 boar j his ships for the attack on copenhagen it was the first battle honour granted t british riflemen two 
 years later the rifle corps was brought into the line an j styled the 95th or rifle regiment with the 
 43rd and 52nd light infantry with whom they now serve in the green jackets brigade they were trained by sir 
 john moore and fought as hs rearguard in the historic retreat to corunna later that year the two regimens arrived 
 on the battlefield at talavera after a forced march of 42 miles in 26 houis over sandy roads under a 
 spanish sun and in the heavy marching order of the period when men carried more than 50 pounds of kit 
 in addition to their arms the rifles greatly distinguished themselves in the storming of fortresses i ciudad rodrigo and badajoz 
 and in 1813 three officers and 50 riflemen held o f 5 000 frenchmen and prevented them from crossing a 
 bridge in the pyrenees after being twice ordered to retire they started the retreat under protest an j most of 
 them were eventually killed or wounded all three battalions of the rifles fought at waterloo and in recognition cf their 
 courage men of the 2nd battalion were ordered to lead the subsequeri 
 the patrician 63 triumphal march into paris in 1816 it was ordered that the 95th with its three battalions should 
 be taken out of the numbered regiments of the line and renamed the rifle brigade south africa crimea and the 
 indian mutiny added further battle honours to the already impressive list although the regiment has nowhere to display them it 
 has never carried colours by virtue of its special role e i during world war one the rifle brigade raised 
 21 fighting battalions and won ten victoria crosses but it paid a high price for its gallantry 546 officers and 
 11 975 soldiers being killed in 1937 the regiment was selected with the 60th rifles the third regiment of the 
 green jackets brigade for the role of motorised troops with an infantry task of protecting armoured regiments in world war 
 two the ist battalion was one of the three rifle battalions which defended calais in 1940 a key factor in 
 i making the evacuation of dunkirk possible perhaps the regiment s most memorable action of the war was at el 
 alamein in 1942 when the 2nd battalion was ordered to go forward through a minefield and hold the snipe position 
 without support it stayed there for 48 hours despite attacks again and again from german and italian tanks 36 of 
 which were knocked out by the riflemen the commanding officer lieutenant colonel v b turner was awarded the victoria cross 
 the 27th to be awarded to the rifle brigade and more than any other regiment earlier that year the duke 
 of connaught had died after being colonel in chief of the regiment since 1880 before this he had seen considerable 
 service with the 95th commanding the ist battalion from 1876 to 1880 he was succeeded 0:suc 0:ceeded by the duke 
 of gloucester the present colonel in chief after the war the regiment saw service in kenya and malaya and in 
 1959 became the 3rd green jackets the rifle brigade serving with the same cap badge as their friends and rivals 
 the 60th the king s royal rifle corps and the 43rd and 52nd the oxfordshire and buckinghamshire light infantry this 
 year the 3rd green jackets have come in for high praise for their conduct 0:con 0:duct during the cyprus operations 
 keeping the peace in that troubled island was a worthy task for the quick thinking green jackets and they rose 
 to the challenge peace was not the only thing they wanted to keep they had their reputation to think of

 who have proven their interest and capability to be true cadets during the past training year rifle shooting was again 
 the outstanding achievement of the corps under the very capable instruction of cpl r walker rcmp and mr r watt

 with needle and thread by the time the tri service competition took place the corps of drums were dressed in 
 scarlets that met all the requirements of regimental dress regulations to have done this from rcmp scarlet tunics was indeed 
 a monumental task another achievement of note was the ability of cadets through various fund raising activities to raise sufficient 
 funds to purchase a complete set of instruments for the corps of drums it is hoped that our absence from
