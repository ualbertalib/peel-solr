 men travelled several times to abundant source of immigrants to the crow s nest poland in an attempt to bring
 over their families pass which suggests that the personal experiences although most of the pioneers probably did not of the
 pioneers encouraged further emigration have much formal education they were not illiter the following excerpt expresses the impressions ate according
 to john liss pozarzycki who of mary wasylkiewicz who visited her parents visited polish miners communities in alberta birthplace in

 dollars per week to ill members and a hundred dollars in the case of death 26 within a few years
 the so ciety was able to buy a house in east coleman calling it the polish hall relatively high wages
 in coal mines as well as a big demand for labour during the first decade of the twentieth century were
 the main factors attracting people to the crow s nest pass on the ot her hand erratic work due to
 frequent strikes and poor organization ie shortage of boxcars and changes in the market for coal made real incomes unstable
 and low this is the reason why so many poles tried to make a living by taking up other jobs
 in slack times they worked in road construe the polish societ of brotherly aid was important to the tion masonry
 carpentry and as farm labourers social and economic life of the community above are being from an agricultural background and
 often delegates to their first convention held in coleman in 1923 left to right front j wdowka a krywolt m

 were joining their families sued each member an identity card stating that but many more single men came as farm

 these documents were recognized by the 1925 as the demand for farm labour occurred authorities in alberta and saved their
 bearers mostly in the summer months they were looking much gnef for other jobs to survive winter in his way
 walter the primary reason for establishing the society chuchla and albert kolber landed in coleman in in canada might have
 been the fact that it was 1926 and 1927 respectively coleman became a magnet for the polish men death benefit
 paid to the family of the miner there were many polish families a polish so was 150 and every member
 of the society was ciety polish hall and two mines i thought i obliged to be present at the funeral

 in october 1929 a new constitution was adopted at its third convention in coleman in the introductory words to the
 polish people ii 1 in all canada it said the polish society of brotherly aid has also as one of
 its aims fostering the mother tongue and national characteristics and also spreading mutual co operation and love among the pol
 i ish immigrants to canada the society is like a family in which you will find kindliness friendship brotherliness and
 love and in which you can develop your minds and make life in a strange land more pleasant the main
 aim of the society was however to assist its members in the case of illness or families in the case
 of death of the member by 1929 the entrance fee was two dollars and the mem bership fee 1 75
 per month sickness allowance was nine dollars per week for the period of up to three months when the society
 had more than fifty members or six dollars per week if it had less the constitution envisaged the possibility of
 7 abuse of the system and therefore in article ix if any of the member falls sick or is hurt
 thru music was part of the social life of the polish communit drinking or any other immoral actions he has
 seen here at coleman in 1929 are joe l awlus lesniak no right to ask for an allowance from the

 however that the positions of president and as before women were in great demand and vice president were always held
 by the earlier were married early victoria materla who came immigrants at the age of seventeen in 1923 married the
 same walter chuchla recalls how he became involved year annie pieronek born in coleman was marin the polish community affairs
 ned at the age of sixteen in 1931 polish families it was november and i got involved right away were
 usually large families families with seven in taking part in jaselka a christmas play to twelve children were quite frequent
 that i used to take part in poland i was so glad having large families women were kept busy to
 help them with staging that play with about 28 persons taking part in it we soon started re looking after
 their households they also contributed to the family income by growing vegetahearsing making costumes decorations and ever yone was enthusiastic
 about learning their ble gardens raising cows and pigs and by keeppart well sunday after christmas we put this ing
 boarders young girls before marriage were play on the stage and to my opinion performed sometimes employed as domestics well
 to the satisfaction of all that could be seat polish women did not have an organization of ed the hall
 was packed and people were stand their own besides charitable and church related ing in the door so we decided
 to repeat it next activities their main involvement was with the sunday this we did and again the hall was
 full many slovaks and ukrainians came to see dance groups wanda murray was a dance instrucit 32 tor who taught
 polish national dances and walter chuchla served also as a secretary of the designed costumes 36 anna gembala designed committee
 responsible for the building of the new and sewed polish costumes worn by the boys in polish hall which was
 finished in 1928 on the site the late l 930 s 37 women made a banner for the polish society
 of brotherly aid which was dediof the first polish hall chuchla a kolber and i maciejowski organized a youth progress
 club cated in 1936 kolko amatorskie postep which soon had sixty the difficult period of the depression is deeply members
 mostly canadian born poles 33 buried in the memories of the poles from the mm we started with a lot
 of activity like drama ing communities of the crow s nest pass for group library entertainment lectur es etc we
 example the only income of the andrew zur had tremendous support we organized concerts family in 1929 was 260 and
 in 1930 60 which and staged plays practically every month since they received from a sale of land in poland
 to mine work was only 2 3 days per week we also supplement this meagre income nellie had chickhelped many
 older peeople when they were ens and cows and kept a few boarders ‘ building a new house mixed cement
 by hand annie pieronek who was the oldest of eight chiland did carpentry work all free of charge we dren
 recalls the life on the family farm run by organized a library with about 3000 books and her mother while
 father worked in the mine pamphlets collected from members the polish press from the usa and bought from poland life
 on farm was not milk and honey when i made a bookcase with a glass door and we the depression
 struck my parents couldn t sell had to double our shelves to place all the books their farm produce so
 had no money for grocer the library was open once a week and 30 40 ies and clothing when winter
 came my father eader s were borrowing books for a small did not get ajob back in the mine we
 used flour fee 34 sacks and sugar sacks to make some of our the following reasons for the popularity of
 the clothes and knit our socks and sweaters 4 youth club were given by one of its members few poles
 were involved in the radical leftist we enjoyed our work in the club very much movement according to available evidence
 poles since in those days no one had a car ther e were did not support the communist workers unity
 no phones very few radios no one even thought of holidays and in the part of town where we league
 in the l 930 s except for a few cases when after the 1932 strike of the sixty two perlived
 there was no electricity every saturday night we had a dance in our hall and somehow sons not rehired in
 blairmore only two were we were happier then than lots of people are today 35 in their reminiscences only two
 persons men tioned that they were considered radicals or rarely were choosing canada as their destination reds 42 also poles
 as a group were not per so poles in canada did not have leftist political ceived as radicals by historians
 leadership such as jews ukrainians or finns had the conservative groups in coleman drew most another reason may have been
 the fact that the of its support from british as well as the polish poles in the crow s nest
 pass were better orcommunity of that town unlike the other na ganized than other ethnic groups while the poltional groups
 in the pass the poles seem to have ish society of brotherly aid existed since 1916 been inclined more towards
 national conserva the first slovak benefit society s branches were tive nationalism than to the left wing radical not established
 until 1928 and only in 1932 was ism during l 930 s the first slovak mutual benefit society founded this
 non involvement in radicalism can be par in blairmore ukrainians were less numerous tially explained by the fact that the
 poles who con than poles twenty eight ukrainians arrived in the stituted the core of the community in the crow
 s pass in the period between 1902 and 1920 and nest pass in the 1930 s belonged to the group
 were able to build their hall only in l 927 this which emigrated before world war one by the might
 also suggest that recent immigrants more l 930 s they were middle aged well established politically conscious played a larger
 role in the and had families to look after after more than activities of these two groups than among poles
 fifteen years in canada they were experienced in the polish ethnic group the new immigrants workers so they were not
 among those who were a minority and the polish community would be laid off first in fact in the 1930
 s while provided support which probably they valued too the older men continued to work the young ones much to
 risk its loss by engaging in radicalism had no jobs at all it should be also mentioned in the opinion
 of the immigrants who arrived afthat at the time of their emigration more politi ter world war one cally conscious
 industrial workers from poland immigrants lacking english were at serious were going to the united states where wages disadvantage but
 with jobs scarce we did not were higher and possibilities of participation in dare to complain the life of the
 organized proletariat better 45 also the vast majority of poles in the crow s nest better educated poles belonging to

 indignation at edmonton the citizens of this town are very indignant at the police authorities and govemment locating the police
 barracks for this division at fort saskatchewan a point 20 miles down the river it does seem an unreasonable thing
 to do the object in view in maintaining a fome of mounted police in the territories is to protect settlers
 and maintain law and order among the natives how this can be done and the police 20 miles away from
 where they are needed is the question wher e their duty is there they should be and their duty is
 in edmonton and vicinity there are some half dozen families around fort saskatchewan and that is all edmonton is a
 town of some hundreds of a population with a well settled country around it all the indian reserves in the
 district with one exception is south west and north west of the town and yet he government moves all the
 police from here and spends thousands of dollars in erecting barracks twenty miles east the ferriage alone cost them last
 year nearly 3 000 as fort saskatchewan is on the opposite side of the river from their work the absence
 of the police from here has been the means of allowing many a rascal to escape punishment a nd caused
 loss in not a few cases to our citizens to cite one instance as an illustration a livery stable proprietor
 here hired a horse and saddle to a man for a short journey shortly afterwards information was received that the
 man was a horse thief word was immediately dispatched for the po lice but before the courier could travel twenty
 miles there and the police twenty miles back the man hor se and saddle wer e gone and have not
 been heard from since some time ago a petition was sent to the authorities asking them to erect their barracks
 and station heir men at edmonton and a favorable reply was received but without any apparent reason fort saskatchewan is
 selected and edmonton and vicinity left without protection it is the only important point in the whole north west territories
 that has been so neglected and ignored a mass meeting of the citizens was held in the school here last
 night and sever al str ongly worded resolutions passed and forwarded to the authorities in reference to the matter it
 is hoped they will bring he desirability of edmonton as a site for the headquarters of the police for this
 division before the government so clearly as to induce them to change the location manitoba free press winnipeg sept 1

 telling her husband that day the accused precipitated another argument her hand was broken her husband responded with this time

 can been seen in the marvsezak ed as possessions of their husbands two cases case of december 1916 heard by

 confinement and repeated beatings while the second resulted in the death of the wife modity note the similarity with the

 bodily harm against ditions between the paulsens went from bad to her husband deft gallaway she told the court worse

 it was not his refusing information obtained from her sister r epeatedly to answer repeated questions as to the possible

 cases is the relative room in the house when she tried to escape he lack of incidents dealing with alcohol
 related beatbeat her again tied her on the bed and threatened ings while it is readily apparent that current to
 gash my throat from ear to ear if she called studies of domestic violence like to indicate a for help
 finally she managed to escape a cou direct relationship between alcohol consumption pie of days later to sympathetic neighbours at
 and the incidence of violence in the home cases which time she was taken toadoctor underoath examined from 1905 to
 1920 in alberta do not he doctor who had examined mrs gallaway told lend themselves to such a conclusion at
 first the court the extent of her injuries he noted glance this trend or more precisely the appar i found
 the right side of the face was swollen ent lack of this trend seems somehow perplexboth eyelids of the right
 eye were contused and ing however upon reflection it should really be bluish red in color the left eye was
 corn of no surprise for example if the beating of one s pletely closed it was impossible to expose the
 wife was socially and legally acceptable within eyeball blood was oozing from the left nostril the privacy of the home
 then surely there was i found that there had been a fracture of no need to consume alcohol in order
 to gain the the left cheek bone and there is partial paraly cour age to commit such an act no
 such crutch sis of the left facial nerve was needed because the system condoned the ac she suffer ed consider
 ably but apparently the tion this statement naturally leads one to the funhusband believed that such a beating had been
 damental question of whether or not wife beating warr anted when questioned by the police gal was condoned by the
 social and legal system as laway said that his wife wasn t doing right and it operated in alberta during
 the first part of the that why he had done it he also asked the twentieth century there can he
 little doubt that constable what he would have done if he had the answer to this question is a resounding
 yes found his wife sleeping with another man or in the first place it is evident that men and wornsomething
 to that effect 3 evidently gallaway en expected some degree of physical violence to believed that his wife s beating
 was justified occur within the institution of marriage several the second example of a case dealing with the witnesses in
 the cases processed through the element of jealousy was heard december 1915 at justice system in alberta from 1905 until
 1920 the supreme court in edmonton where maruis gave testimony that they had seen physical abuse paulsen was on trial
 for murdering his wife on several occasions yet they had not stepped into several witnesses told the court that the
 paulsens the fray nor contacted a police officer for cxwho lived near eunice alberta had quarr eled and ample in
 october 1909 a witness told an edmonfought ever since they had first been married over ton court hearing that she
 had seen her father infourteen years previously one witness testified law beat his wife several times but she had done
 hat he had ovetheard a heated argument between nothing to stop it and did not inform anyone s the paulsens
 over the purchasing of a new cow another case heard befure the supreme court in paulsen told his wife that
 it was an unnecessary the district of wetaskiwin in december 1916 told expense and a waste of money while she
 argued the tale of two witnesses a husband and wife who that it was a worthwhile and much needed corn
 had been present when the husband had physically abused his wife yet after witnessing the assault wife in 1913 at
 their home in hardisty furtherthey simply went home more he did not dispute his wife s testimony in not only
 did outsiders to the family unit seem which she stated that she had experienced severto toler ate physical abuse as
 acceptable behavior a l beatings throughout their marriage expressing so too did the wives for instance in the no remorse
 for his actions schogeim told the schogeim case of september 1913 the wife stipu court the evidence is mostly true
 lated that while she and her husband had quar in the 1913 russell case dealing with assault reled on this
 particular occasion it was not the causing bodily harm with a rolling pin the wife type of quarrel which warranted
 a beating this declared that the beatings had occurred over a pe ristatement suggests that according to mrs od of
 eighteen years yet the accused stated i schogeim certain quarrels did in fact warrant a have not quarreled with my
 wife during he whole beating 7 similar thoughts are evident in the of my married life although we have had
 several russell case in the same year laying a charge little spats 2 quite obviously the russells had of assault
 causing bodily harm with a rolling pin a difference of perception what mrs russell against her husband mrs russell noted
 that she classified as a beating which resulted in bruises could not understand what precipitated the attack and black eyes
 was considered by her husband to since she had never assaulted her husband in any be a natural outcome of
 minor disagreements way t and lastly when reading the testimony of which all married couples experience the wife in the
 marrysak case 1917 assaulting the classic example of the general acceptance wife by striking her with a pitch fork one
 can of beating one s wife is the gallaway case of not help but be aware of the ftict that
 mrs mar november 1906 in calgar y already cited is the mysak seemed to feel that she deserved to be
 beaten doctor s account of the terrible injuries incurred to the extent of her receiving broken bones for by lena
 gallaway while she was confined to a not working hard enough in other words the room and tied to a
 bed for a couple of days violence was both warranted and justified despite the fact that a newspaper reporter specu
 husbands also displayed a general acceptance lated that lena might lose her left eye throughfor domestic violence for example martin
 out the proceedings gallaway never expressed any schogeim readily admitted that he had beaten his feeling of remorse he felt
 his actions were corn it ssas here at the i dmonton courthouse hal trials such as the paulsen murder case
 s ere held pletely justified and quietly told the police that he of liquor other witnesses corroborated her teshad in
 fact beaten his wife and he would take timony although convicted of the offence demhis medicine for it 23 it
 is of interest to note that bruski was merely ordered to pay the court costs gallaway entered a plea of
 not guilty which amounted to 4 90 to keep the peace for but what of the criminal justice system itself
 a total of twelve months and to post a one hundred did it condone the pr actice of wife beating
 the dollar bond if he was in default of payment he answer is yes despite the fact that the criminal
 was liable to a three month term of imprisonment code provided for either a two year or three year in
 fort saskatchewan term of imprisonment plus the lash dependent the marvsezak case of december 1916 which upon which section of
 the code one was charged has been dealt with at great length in this paper with violating he case material
 suggests that the also serves as another example of the legal sysjudges were reluctant to impose the maximum sen tern
 s appar ent leniency in cases of wife abuse tence of confinement and or any lashes when a in spite
 of the fact hat there were at least two witcase file does contain information about the final nesses to the
 shoving and kicking incident the outcome of the charge and the sentence of the justice of the peace fined the
 accused 20 plus judge it is evident that if and when a penalty was court costs of 12 75 or
 in the case of default given it was at best a token one while nearly of payment thirty days with
 hard labour in the ever y one of the cases used for this study illus fort saskatchewan gaol 28 trates
 the acquiescence of the justice system to the under the sensational headline of mike szolopractice of wife beating only a
 few have been gan beat up his wife september 24 1919 selected to reinforce this argument issue of the lethbridge
 daily news recounted the firstly there are several instances where the ac story of how szologan had been found guilty
 by cused was found guilty of assaulting his wife yet the supreme court of the district of lethbndge the court
 meted out a fine in lieu of confinement of beating his wife with the leg of a table the or
 just a fine itself for example in the summer newspaper account went on to say that the accused of 1907
 julius lenz was found guilty of wife had been fined 50 or in default of payment one beating by the
 supreme court of the district of month imprisonment in the provincial gaol szolo edmonton and was fined court costs 25
 the same gan was also told to be on his best behavior and court found thomas hunter guilty of assaulting
 to keep the peace for a period of three years his wife in november 1910 he was fined ten dol
 the court s provision for a three year period of lars plus court costs and he was bound over to
 peace is one of the longest time lines assigned by keep the peace for one year on a one hundred
 dol the justice system in alberta from 1905 to 1920 lar bond the judge also ordered hunter to report to
 complete the evidence of the system s to the justice of the peace once a month 2 t one propensity
 to levy fines there is the knutzen case would think that the judge would stipulate that in of december 1920
 heard before the district court stead of hunter reporting to the justice of the in hanna knutzen was found guilty
 of assault peace he would order the wife to appear that ing his wife and as a result he was
 ordered to post way a representative from the justice system could a 500 bond and to keep the peace for
 one see if hunter was in fact keeping the peace year 3 one wonders what happened after the in a
 rather classic example sophia dembruski twelve months were up laid a charge of wife beating against her husband it is
 interesting to note that it seemed to make in february 1911 in her testimony to the supreme absolutely no differ
 ence to the sentence meted out court of the district of edmonton she stated that by the judge as to
 whether or not the accused adshe had run away from her husband several times mitted to beating his wife there
 are no indicabecause of repeated beatings on one such occa tions that if the accused pleaded guilty to the sion
 she noted that he had beaten her four times charge that he received a stiffer penalty than somewhile she had
 been sick in bed in one of the few one who pleaded not guilty but who was eventucases where alcohol
 was a factor she further tes ally found guilty by the system for example tified that her husband had a
 tendency to beat her charles broadhead readily admitted to the june and the children when he was under the influence
 21 1907 sitting of the supreme court of the dis interior of the edmonton courthouse shows a typical courtroom with
 a trial underway several wife beating charges found their way into this court trict of edmonton that he had repeatedly
 beaten lecture would not stop harensluk from beating his his wife during the month of september 1906 af wife for
 ever and a day in essence the accused ter pleading guilty to the charge the justice of had mer ely
 received a tongue lashing for his acthe peace fined broadhead two dollars or in lieu tions and it was never
 expected or intended that of payment ten days in jail 3 in september harensluk would cease to raise his hand
 against 1913 martin schogeim pleaded guilty of a charge his wife a mere fine and a lecture from a police
 of assaulting his wife not only on the date cited magistr ate deemed it to be so in his wife
 s deposition but throughout their en a second case in lethbridge dealt with a man tire marriage despite this admission
 of guilt the named john paulenko who it was said had court sentenced schogeim to one month in the made
 a reputation for appearances in the court for gaol at the guard room at fort saskatchewan wife beating there is
 no indication as to how just as a plea of guilty apparently made no many instances of wife beating comprised
 a sodifference to the severity of the penalty there also called reputation whatever the case paulenko apare indications that it
 was of little concern to the peared before the court in late may 1919 despite representatives of the justice system
 as to whether his repeated appearances and his celebrated repuor not the husband had been previously charged tation the presiding
 magistr ate in finding and or convicted of wife beating two cases both paulenko guilty yet again resorted to a
 fine of tried in the supreme court of the district of leth five dollars plus court costs in addition paulenko
 bridge serve best to illustrate this point was ordered to keep the peace between his wife in late september 1917
 john harensluk ap and himself for the next twelve months peared before police magistr ate elton on a second in
 ma ny instances charges of wife beating were charge of wife beating subsequently he was con dismissed by the court
 apparently there were two victed and fined 20 the september 25 1917 reasons for this one of which was due
 to a real issue of the lethbridge herald noted that magis or perceived lack of evidence although mrs trate elton
 read him a lecture that should hold him chrychuiko told the 1910 sitting of the supreme awhile 33 of course
 what is of interest in the court of the district of edmonton that her husnewspaper account is the suggestion that
 elton s band had hit her in the face and kicked her in the body on january 20 th of
 the same year the judge seemed reluctant to use the full letter of the law dismissed the charge due to
 a lack of evidence or perhaps more precisely any letter of the law there is no indication whether the lack
 of evidence at all to step into the private domain of the instiwas based upon insufficient corroborative evi tution of
 marriage and family to control activities dence or whet her the bruises from the beating had within them hea led
 in a week resulting in no physical evidence research indicates there were no cases during to support the charge 36
 the period under study where the maximum term the second reason charges of wife beating were of imprisonment was imposed
 there also were dropped has to do with the wife either refusing no cases found where the lash had been
 assigned to give testimony against her husband or with if one was tempted to establish sentencing patdrawing the complaint altogether
 one can well terns it would be an easy task there are none imagine the trauma of laying a charge
 of wife at best one can conlude that the system had a beating against one s mate in the first
 part of the propensity to hand out a monetary fine and or a twentieth century when domestic violence was very
 limited term of confinement in those cases seemingly condoned by law and society most where the sentence of the judge
 was recorded the certainly a woman must have experienced great available information suggests that a gaol term mental anguish as
 she debated whether or not the ranging from one to six months was the norm beating transcended the line of
 the acceptable level perhaps the representatives of the criminal justice of violence expected within the home environ system envisioned an
 order of keeping the peace ment then once the charge was laid she would a nd or being on one
 s best behaviour for a set peribe forced to return home since there were no od of time usually a
 year as a sufficient type of women s shelters to receive her and her children confinement whatever the case long
 terms in since the family unit had to be preserved there gaol were not the order of the day were
 no provisions for its breakdown reconcili while it is evident that the criminal justice sysation was the ultimate goal yet
 one need only tem provided little recourse for the victim the use their imagination to visualize the situation at question

 want hem to go out on the macleod trail macleod trail to which the man replied that he but down

 had become of her she wrote to charlie knox regret it this i promptly did and paid the pedwho contacted
 an old friend of his a man named dler twenty pounds for her browning who was an irish breeder of
 thorough it was the best deal i ever made in my life may breds browning had run a bunch of
 cattle on the w never left my ownership until i buried her range in the macleod area with ned maunsell

 others yearling at the newmarket sales and knew noth you can assure all of may w s canadian friends ing
 of may w or what had become of her he that she had a good home with every care added
 that minway was the best mare he had raced in years and that he still had her in his stud
