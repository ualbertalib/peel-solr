 1 the patrician 1991 colonel in chief princess patricia s canadian light infantry the countess mountbatten of burma cbe cd 
 jp dl message from the colonel in chief the world has seen some momentous changes and events in the course 
 of 1991 which are having a great effect on our lives mostly for the better but nevertheless they have brought 
 some problems too the principal event of the earlier physical crumbling of the berlin wall has ended in the amazing 
 0:amaz 0:ing turn of events of the complete demise and repudiation of communism after 74 years of despotic rule with 
 it has come the dissolution of the u s s r for so long the possible enemy of the western 
 world at the same time we are experiencing on both sides of the atlantic severe economic and financial problems taken 
 together these two facts the lifting of fears of aggression and the problems 0:prob 0:lems of the financial recession are 
 causing great upheavals in the military world cuts in numbers and economies of finance will of course cause many problems 
 that have to be faced however i am quite certain that they will not affect the quality of our regiment 
 and the soldiers who serve in it indeed if we are not to be so numerous the standard must be 
 even higher to achieve the same results a great challenge there are difficulties ahead and sadly some disappointments to be 
 endured but we will still emerge the fine regiment we have always been for 77 years and i know my 
 patricias will always stand for all that is best in a regiment from junior private to senior general

 cd message from the colonel of the regiment as the regiment completes yet another year of service to canada it 
 is worthwhile reflecting on what we have done and to think ahead to the many challenges before us first battalion 
 has completed another of the regiment s many tours in cyprus it was a highlight of that duty when lady 
 patricia and her husband were able to visit during august 1991 as usual her interest in the battalion s activities 
 and in the welfare of all ranks was evident and much appreciated by those serving with the unit at that 
 time a change of command and change of rsm s took place immediately on return to canada and i know 
 that i speak for all when we thank the incoming and outgoing gentlemen for their contributions and wish them all 
 well in future endeavours second battalion celebrated the fourtieth anniversary of the battle of kapyong by receiving and trooping new 
 colours in june of particular joy to all was the presence and participation at the event of colonel jim stone 
 he enjoyed all the activities nearly as much as we enjoyed having him in our midst once again lady patricia 
 visited for a short but pleasant time before going on the victoria third battalion exercised the freedom of the city 
 of victoria on canada day in the presence of the colonel in chief this was followed by the firing of 
 a feu de joie on the legislature grounds and was a particularly spectacular event for all concerned a change of 
 rsm s took place here as well and both gentlemen involved deserve thanks and congratulations throughout the many events of 
 the regiment s year on which it was on parade the association was close by the interest in the serving 
 members and what they are doing has not been higher in the minds of those of us who have retired 
 from active service as more move from uniform to other occupations and activities the association continues to provide that vital 
 link between past present and future as we are going to press with this issue there are new challenges being 
 offered to the regiment these range from the possibility of other additional peacekeeping assignments to necessary organizational changes and a 
 closer relationship 0:relation 0:ship with the militia fresh insights will be needed to cope with change and to recognize the 
 opportunities presented as always the regiment stands ready to meet the tasks presented and will acquit itself with credit to 
 all ranks and to the members of the association may i express my congratulations on a year of great accomplishments 
 0:accom 0:plishments and to say thank you for the many kindnesses and courtesies extended to me and to my wife 
 marianne during the course of our visits and duties god s speed and best wishes to all patricias

 10 the patrician 1991 sashes the custom of wearing sashes originally as an article for a practical purpose but which 
 developed into a sign of rank is fairly ancient as far back as the seventeenth century the sash was worn 
 either round the waist or over a shoulder falling to the opposite side the original purpose of the sash was 
 for the carrying of a wounded officer off the field to which end they were usually made of silk being 
 strong as well as light and full enough to enclose the human form clifford walton in his history of the 
 british army 1600 1700 states that the sash was worn by all officers from the general down to the sergeant 
 whether horse foot or dragoons the material was similar to that still in vogue the fringes however being in the 
 case of commissioned officers of gold or silver in this as in most other details considerable licence prevailed prior to 
 the revolution 1688 some officers preferring silver net work others gold while others again favoured plain crimson silk but by 
 degrees greater uniformity was ensured and the use of gold and silver network became confined to the highest officers the 
 sashes of officers of horse were exceedingly handsome having rich fringes two three or even four deep round the waist 
 and very deep fringes at the ends the private troopers of horse also wore sashes the only exception to the 
 general colour being the fourth dragoon guards whose sashes wore white pikemen in foot regiments were similarly distinguished by sashes 
 but of white worsted with a coloured fringe in some regiments of foot all the men appear to have worn 
 sashes in charles s reign there is nothing new under the sun and the fashion introduced but a few years 
 ago of wearing the sash over the shoulder was usual also in the beginning of the seventeenth century during the 
 latter half of the century however the custom was generally to wear it round the waist whatever freedom officers had 
 in the seventeenth century in regard to the method of wearing the sash a clothing regulation of 1747 directed that 
 officers of the infantry should wear it over the right shoulder and those of cavalry over the left shoulder and 
 that ncos of both arms should wear it round the waist the royal warrant for clothing of 19th december 1768 
 gave more precise details in regard to this matter for it decreed that officers of cavalry and infantry the sashes 
 will be crimson silk and worn round the waist sergeants of dragoon guards dragoons and light dragoons a sash round 
 the waist of crimson spun silk with a stripe of the facings of the regiment sergeants of infantry the sash 
 to be crimson worsted with a stripe of the colour of the facing of the regiment and worn round the 
 waist here we have three kinds of material being used crimson silk for officers crimson spun silk for sergeants of 
 cavalry crimson worsted for sergeants of infantry further the officers sashes were all crimson whilst those of the sergeants were 
 crimson with a stripe of the colour of the facings of the regiment as to the colour of sergeants sashes 
 this has varies with the passage of time e g 1727 generally crimson and colour facings mixed 1750 the royal 
 scots greys striped red blue and yellow 1753 the royal dragoons blue 1768 as in royal warrant crimson with a 
 stripe of colour of regimental facing 1826 horse guards memo 18 feb 1826 f0ur stripes of crimson and three of 
 other colour 1845 new pattern crimson and scarlet as at present the multicoloured sashes were abolished because when they got 
 wet the colours ran into each other in 1855 when the tunic was introduced field marshals and general officers wore 
 their sashes over the left shoulder 0:shoul 0:der this method maintained until by general order no 90 of ist april 
 1882 it was directed to be worn round the waist the same general order stated that with the tunic the 
 sash will be worn diagonally over the left shoulder and over the sword belt in 1912 however all officers wore 
 their sashes round the waist knotted on the left side whilst warrant officers and sergeants wear theirs over the right 
 shoulder falling to the left side in the somerset light infantry however the officers knot their sashes on the right 
 side and the sergeants wear theirs over the left shoulder falling to the right i e the reverse of the 
 general method as regards the sergeants of the somerset light infantry the wearing of their sashes over the left shoulder 
 was authorized by horse guards on 3rd april 1865 this custom came about to commemorate the battle of culloden in 
 1746 when all officers were struck down and the regiment was commanded by its sergeants in canada before confederation all 
 uniforms and regulations for dress followed the british customs and the sash carried on to the present day as just 
 on of the many traditions held onto from our past

 dian way what do you mean this isn t the top climbing black rock mountain for 1 ppcli 1991 was 
 a special year for the time had come once again for the battalion to go to cyprus as canada s 
 representative although the battalion has been there before 5 times in fact and may senior battalion pers have at least 
 one previous tour to their credit a peacekeeping tour is still special for the simple reason that it is an 
 operational 0:opera 0:tional tasking many of the peacetime restrictions placed on the unit are lifted to facilitate operational readiness prior 
 to operation snowgoose 55 the battalion conducted winter indoctrination training for the headquarters 0:headquar 0:ters of ace mobile force land 
 the participants were introduced to canadian kit and shown some basics of movement and living in winter conditions a two 
 day exercise was conducted where snow shelters were constructed 0:con 0:structed and lunch was eaten at the peak of black 
 rock mountain where the rations refused to heat up despite the boiling water the visiting group consisted of soldiers of 
 all classifications and trades including clerks an italian mountain guide and two british officers who served in the falklands as 
 a result the exercise was as much of a tent routine again the colours as 1 ppcli assumes command learning 
 experience for the directing staff as the visitors with many stories being exchanged over a log fire the months of 
 january and february were dominated by preparations for the rapidly approaching deployment to cyprus for the best part of the 
 previous six months captain pidgen had been working hard in his capacity as rot o in preparation for the deployment 
 with the new year everyone got involved as the battalion reconfigured and other matters were deep sixed until september or 
 rear party whichever came first a small two day exercise was conducted in an effort to prepare the line companies 
 for some of the challenges they could expect to face while away it was invaluable as it provoked many of 
 the questions 0:ques 0:tions which otherwise might not have been asked until faced with actual situations in cyprus the exercise 
 was also the first time for many to meet the militia soldiers who were to make the trip with us 
 the three officers and 73 men and women had actually been training on their own for some time in preparation 
 spending many a day on the ranges at sarcee and wainwright

 we were coming so what are we looking for an impromptu kit check at trenton traffic control at paphos gate

 storm and the dag from hell which required all pcs to be at the drill hall by 0430 although it 
 wasn t much more than 10c on arrival in cyprus it certainly felt balmy after the chill of sub zero 
 temperatures which had been left behind the remainder of the battalion followed approx 10 days later and assumed control of 
 what is easily the most disputed part of the green line the six month tour was highlighted by two particular 
 aspects the first was the success encountered on the line the soldiers executed their duties aggressively as infantry soldiers should 
 and left their mark by managing to retake several key pieces of ground such as the disputed olympus hotel in 
 the city company sector it is to the credit of all that the only major incidents during our tour except 
 one shooting by a young turkish soldier who obviously failed his personal weapons test came as a result of the 
 aggressive 0:aggres 0:sive execution of their duties by the first battalion soldiers it is far better to have to deal 
 with soldiers doing more than is required than dealing with someone doing less there was no doubt who held the 
 initiative

 his office the second aspect of success is the way in which the battalion teams totally dominated almost every competition 
 conducted during our six months on the island the high point was definitely the 1 2 3 finish of the 
 canadian teams in the military skills competition this caused the force comd mgen milner to announce that he was proud 
 to be a canadian not to be outdone by the achievements of the mil skills teams the 1 ppcli track

 an uphill battle from the outset but they persevered and clinched first place in the second last of nineteen events

 endure many long hours exposed to the relentless heat on the beaches in ayia napa needless to say every man 
 did his bit to improve international relations warrant owen was kept quite busy in his secondary duty as the contingent 
 scuba instructor in fact next to the perennial favourites of drill and line tours scuba was by far the most 
 popular in fact that some chose to take a civilian course as the military courses were all full the soldiers 
 would not be deprived of their right to drill however and so with this in mind some vtp s lgen 
 foster bgen ashton adm george commissioner bell and just about anyone else who was either interested or curious were brought 
 into the canadian sector to be given honour guards and line tours those soldiers not fortunate enough to be involved 
 in the drill were usually given the opportunity to give the standard briefing which greeted guests at every observation post

 take on the specialist positions that they had worked so hard to learn bravo zulu to all course staffs for 
 a job well done pre wainwright preparation patrol training in the rain forest of vancouver island occupied the soldiers hearts 
 minds and feet for the last week of march and first week of april the remainder of april was taken

 competition which afforded pi commanders 0:command 0:ers an excellent opportunity to lead their pi through a live fire fighting patrol 
 ex rotary strike consisted of live fire coy airmobile operations airmobile ops always quicken the heart rate of even veteran 
 soldiers and operating on a coy level was exhilarating it is not very often that a soldier or a commander 
 gets to participate in a live fire combat team attack but we all had a chance to do this during

 mountain ops course involved seven days of intensive training during which candidates were exposed to various mountaineering procedures ranging from 
 mountain walking techniques to difficult mountain casualty evacuations the unarmed combat training focused on basic skills with a view to 
 setting a foundation upon which to teach more advanced skills while the short five day programme did not create a 
 battalion of bruce lees it did serve to create a sense of aggression alertness and confidence within the soldiers terry

 of esquimau upon completion of the run lcoi kenward presented a cheque for 1 000 00 to the terry fox

 of some sort involving internal security operations remembrance day dawned cloudy and dismal in victoria a fitting weather situation for 
 the purpose of the day 3 ppcli began the day with its own ceremony on the parade square and then 
 sent a contingent to each of the victoria and esquimalt parades the day passed sombrely and our comrades of yesteryear

 of which is making new friends and acquaintances and working together as a team there were to be sure times

 the loyal edmonton regiment 0:regi 0:ment and the new westminster regiment jump platoons for their annual contact training in spite 
 of fair winds the landings were not soft and some troopers crashed through the trees at the end of dz 
 saville farm the injury rate was higher than expected even with a complete malfunction 0:malfunc 0:tion thankfully no one was 
 seriously hurt soldiering on through injuries and accepting casualties is all part of being a jumper the dz was quickly 
 cleared and the ex was underway burma rig was designed to practice raids and ambushes at platoon and commando level 
 both the regular and militia soldiers shouldered the load and made burma rig an excellent training ex the general adams 
 competition is an annual affair designed to give the platoons of the regiment a chance to compete in skill at 
 arms and marching this year it was adapted to cross country skiing of the ever faithful bangee boards across 15kms 
 of well worn trails and through a bitter wind 2 commando s platoons charged unabashed and unashamed unfortunately our times 
 wern t faster than other teams but we still hold that our graceful style should have won us more points 
 we ll get them next year after general adams came general crabbe who decided that 2 cdo should once again 
 display their skiing prowess and gave us the task of skiing 13 kms to the rifle ranges and conducting a 
 live shoot as part of his brigade commanders inspection once again on the blazing pine boards we took to the 
 trails unfortunately the day warmed up considerably and the heavy snow took its toll on the skis several pairs were 
 broken in the mad dash but we succeeded in getting everyone out to the ranges to complete the inspection not 
 much can be said about ex pegasus blizzard which was the next task for the cdo unfortunately bad weather turned 
 the regiment back twice over dz anzio after name of the earth flights and the scheduled short insertion was a

 0:tition april was a time for commando training two exercises 0:exer 0:cises took up the majority of the month the 
 first was ex rebel hunter a helicopter patrol week which pitted platoon against platoon the mission was to find and 
 destroy the other platoon patrol base and capture their flag the ex started with a helicopter insertion each platoon had 
 three lifts by a chinook the troops were dropped with assault b oats and all equipment into the water the 
 troops made their way to the boats mounted up and made their way to the platoon rvs once ashore the 
 platoons made their way to their assigned objective the exercise was a great success planning and execution was challenged to 
 the limit the young soldiers were given the opportunity to conduct recces and were providing vital information to their platoon 
 cps at the end two platoons found and destroyed their enemy each platoon then secured a dz and was extracted 
 by hueys the exercise proved to be a challenge to all good lessons and skills were learned by all it 
 was a good shake out for the commandos upcoming mission during the regimental and brigade exercises the other major deployment 
 took the commando to connaught ranges for a week of shooting work ups were done and the week ended by 
 each soldier completing his annual pwt the days were long and the nights longer recreation runs were conducted to take 
 soldiers to ottawa for a night on the town the trips to ottawa proved to be a good morale booster 
 for all we managed to escape connaught 0:con 0:naught with only one major incident but at least the drivers on 
 the highway one night have a better knowledge of the anatomy of a certain airborne soldier the month of april 
 was a good build up for the next few weeks and now on to may the month of may for 
 2 commando started with an early morning quick rig bug out this was to be the start of ex thunderbolt 
 an all arms ssf ex within two days the skies over meaford ontario were filled with the silk of 2 
 commando soldiers the mission was to destroy a drug cartel operating a drug shipping port on the coast of the 
 georgian bay from the dz ry the fighting elements of the commando were to infiltrate to a commando link up 
 ten miles away most elements encountered heavy resistance along the way easily destroying anything in their paths the link up 
 was successful and it was time to prepare a plan to assault the objective the attack was conducted at night 
 after a detailed recce of the objective which took two days at 0120 hrs the objective was secured and the 
 commando moved at first light to an extraction point with the conquer of meaford under our belts we headed back 
 to petawawa for phase 11 a regimental battle school the battle school was designed to train platoons in small unit 
 airborne tactics the stands consisted of an assault on a soviet position day and night stalking exercise section attacks and 
 a platoon raid once phase ii was over the commando was to jump in secure points and open routes for 
 the remainder of the brigade 2 commando was tasked to infiltrate and prepare a water crossing point for 1 rcr 
 and the rcd the exercise overall had gone very well a lot of lessons were learned and it proved to 
 be a good shake out for the commando once again 2 commando proved our reputation as the backbone of the 
 ssf this exercise quickly brought an end to may as we headed into a busy lune the first part of 
 lune saw the commando deployed to mountain school a week of basic mountaineering gave each soldier his basic mountain osq 
 the culmination of training was a commando mission which had the commando 0:com 0:mando conduct an amphibious mountain raid on 
 an objective 0:objec 0:tive the remainder of june had the commando preparing for a summer regimental battle school this battle 
 school was in the form of a competition the competition consisted of two parts part 1 was a march and 
 shoot military skills competition and the second was a sports day the commando s 0:comman 0:do 0:s performance earned them 
 once again the top commando 0:com 0:mando in the regiment 
 57 the patrician 1991 the patrician july for most of the commando was used for a well deserved period of 
 block leave for those that did not take advantage of leave they were preparing for cac 91 a patrol stand 
 for lfca militia units on returning from block leave at the end of july the commando set to the task 
 of assisting their total force brethren in cac9i in so doing all members in the unit were intimately involved in 
 conveying skills of patrolling in retrospect the event ran quite well thanks to the efforts of all ranks involved particularly 
 mcpl parolin whose presence alone established him as chief intimidator one event which provided a clear focus for the fall 
 training period was the receipt of the warning order for op python the possibility of deploying to the western sahara 
 as part of a united nations contingent forced the commando to look at some varied and interesting training such as 
 control of entry points cordons and searches vehicle check points refugee control and the operation of repatriation centres training 0:train 
 0:ing on personal and crew served weapons was given and continued at a more rigorous pace culminating in a variety 
 of ranges including pairs fire and movement jungle lanes and section live fire the month of september and october training 
 period was put to the test in ex pegasus bleuet in bagotville que despite a slow start due to being 
 stop dropped on deployment the exercise moved quite quickly throughout the commando raced to its first objective and seized the 
 bridge in tact almost without a hitch our second mission involved a commando fighting patrol to seize a well defended 
 radar installation 0:installa 0:tion needless to say the commando seized the objective despite the preparedness 0:prepared 0:ness of the enemy 
 and one unfortunate detonation of an elsie mine oops in the remaining thirty six hours of the exercise the unit 
 occupied itself with the joint tasks of refugee control and lhe manning of repatriation centres the highlight of this affair 
 had to be the unconfirmed elvis sighting at the repatriation centre he was drinking a 7 11 slurpee au in 
 all a good exercise designed by e m stockwell petawawa toyota 687 8171 of petm j 4runner 4 door sr5

 extremely well earning a second and fifth place finish among the platoons in the regiment december was the usual pre

 short what more could you ask for following the mens christmas dinner the regiment was dismissed for a well deserved 
 christmas leave most troops disappeared from petawawa returning home to loved ones all in all 2 commando has had another 
 successful year hard and challenging training filled most days the moral of the commando remains at the highest of standard 
 0:stand 0:ard despite the disappointment of not deploying to the western sahara as of yet there still lies many challenges 
 ahead for 2 commando in the new year until next this is 2 commando signing off with fair winds and

 holds several functions specifically intended for battle school staff and their families this year was no different than any other 
 a wild game dinner was prepared in the spring with various types of fowl and large game the traditional family 
 day was enjoyed by all especially the death slide secretaries barb hammer and judy gouthro in the fall a meet 
 and greet was held so that new members of the battle school became introduced to new friends and reacquainted with 
 old ones the most important is the farewell dinner held for outgoing members of the battle school thanking them for

 no strangers to the middle east all members having served in unficyp and one member in undof many unique opportunities 
 were experienced beginning with the vast abundance of dangers left by the war were the unimaginable amounts of new generation 
 mines left behind by both coalition and iraqi forces as well as the massive amounts of unused ordenance left from 
 the many abandoned iraqi soviet armoured vehicles not forgetting the large population of scorpions the living kind camel spiders and 
 a wide variety of vipers most of the soviet armoured equipment only seen in refresher training during battalion afv classes 
 was examined as well a variety of soviet small arms machine guns rocket launchers and grenades were tested then there 
 was the much publicized kuwait oil well fires in the north east and in the south which blotted out the 
 midday sun for the first 3 4 months of the tour all these led to unique experiences readily and energetically 
 absorbed by the patricias finally our thanks and gratitude is extended to the men and officers of 1 cer for 
 including us as one of their own and involving the patricias in their many taskings much respect was gained by 
 working hand in hand with the engineers and many friends made by private j w cullen a father and son

 the rae edzo army cadet corps which is affiliated with the first battalion during a formal dinner lady patricia paid 
 tribute to gen gollner s many years of service to the regiment and canada as a soldier s soldier the 
 low point of the year was the departure of gen and christine gollner into retirement on 8 aug gen gollner

 72 the patrician 1991 the patrician saskatchewan district patricias greetings to the rest of the regiment from those of us 
 serving on the windy plains of canada s heart land 1991 was a busy year which saw some significant changes 
 to the patricia presence in saskatchewan with the implementation 0:implementa 0:tion of land force western area and the creation of 
 a total force district hq in the province this past year has seen a modest increase in the size of 
 our contingent as well as some changes to personnel fear not intrepid readers the regiment 0:regi 0:ment continues to be 
 well represented throughout the vast hinterland that is saskatchewan as the majority of saskatchewan patricias are directly employed in the 
 militia support role increasing emphasis on the total force concept resulted in a very busy past year for all ranks 
 assisting in the planning and execution of progressive training for the north saskatchewan 0:saskatch 0:ewan regiment and the royal regina 
 rifles ensured an active spring period for the regular support staffs of those units this was followed by a hectic 
 summer training programme at mtc dundurn which involved not only our own personnel but also a large increment staff provided 
 by the three battalions of the regiment of particular note was the strong patricia instructor presence in support of exercise 
 bold eagle 11 this highly successful trial programme saw the summer training of two saskatchewan native recruit platoons to reserve 
 ql3 infantry standards concurrent with milcon 91 came the annual posting season and some new faces in the province welcomed 
 into the saskatchewan fold were capt mark campbell capt chris barr capt dave vernon and mcpl martin rancourt cpl greg 
 sloane left the n sask r to join second battalion in winnipeg and all ranks wish him well in his 
 endeavours there a final summer not worthy of mention was the well deserved promotion of mcpl tony whitthall to the 
 rank of sgt on 01 july did anyone in saskatchewan see him without a drill cane in his hands after 
 01 july we think he sleeps with it naturally the pace increased again in the fall as folks settied into 
 their new jobs and the revised saskatchewan district hq got itself up and running all ranks attended an rss range 
 practice in september where even capt vernon managed to qualify with a little help from his friends in the butts 
 late november saw a small but determined band of saskatchewan patricias brave the winter roads on a quick trip to 
 cabc edmonton for some casual parachuting and before we knew it christmas was upon us needless to say all survived 
 the counuess festive gatherings and once again upheld the fine reputation of the regiment it was a dirty job but 
 with the new year upon us 1992 is shaping up to be another busy year for those of us here 
 in saskatchewan plans are well under way for a local celebration of the regimental birthday in march and work has 
 begun on what promised to be one of the busiest summer training cycles at mtc dundurn in recent years as 
 we were unable to submit a photo of our small but erstwhile group this year technical difficulties the least we 
 can do is tell you who is serving in saskatchewan these days bear in mind that in addition to our 
 serving ere patricias there are many ex serving members active in the militia as well as a healthy regimental association

 the patrician 1991 73 the patrician the ppcu memorial cairn in its new location at landsdowne park ottawa 11 november 
 1991 ottawa area patricias 1991 was a year of particular challenge for the canadian 0:cana 0:dian forces from operation friction 
 through to unikom and the announcement of a new defence policy it was also a year in which the ottawa 
 area patricia s played a number of roles certainly the preeminent and most visible patricia throughout the year was general 
 de chastelain who as the cds led a strong and broad based regimental presence in the nation s capital the 
 cds was supported in the higher echelons of ndhq by major general s reay and sharpe who prior to their 
 summer postings were the chief of land doctrine and operations cldo and the chief operational planning and force development copfd 
 respectively however regimental involvement was not limited to ottawa alone lieutenant colonel glenn nordick left dlotr to join canforme headquarters 
 in bahrain and later lieutenant colonel mike mckeown left dlr and joined unikom in kuwait both have since returned to 
 ottawa since the posting season the prime function of most ndhq staffs has been the execution of the new defence 
 policy lieutenant general foster newly appointed as adm per is guiding the considerable and sensitive changes to personnel policy another 
 key element of the new defence policy is a renewed emphasis on equipment and here too patricia s are active 
 for example several regimental officers led by lieutenant colonel al johnston are performing both project direction and project management 0:manage 
 0:ment function for a number of training and simulation projects these projects are noteworthy as they promise to greatly demonstrate 
 the value of technical staff training to the regiment patricia s are also playing an increasingly influential role in equipment 
 acquisition in the dlr 5 infantry equipment section four of the six staff officers working for lieutenant colonel pierre lachapelle 
 are patricias in addition to these tasks ottawa patricias continue to perform a wide variety of functions throughout all branches 
 of ndhq as reported last year there is also a large regimental presence in the local rss staff including the 
 ceremonial guard at the cf language school and at the land engineering and test establishment the last half of the 
 year has seen a rejuvenation of regimental bonds in the region social function have been well attended and a close 
 relationship with the local branch of the ppcli association is being maintained in september 0:septem 0:ber we had an unfortunate 
 incident involving the ppcli memorial cairn located at lansdowne park the cairn was unceremoniously uprooted and moved during renovations to 
 the civic centre all of this was done without consultation with the regiment quick action by brigadier general retd snider 
 alerted city officials to the fact that there is an active and vocal regimental representation here in ottawa civic officials 
 returned the memorial to its proper place in a prompt and safe manner just in time for our annual remembrance

 the patrician 1991 75 the patrician royal military college the following letter was received by regimental headquarters via a clandestine 
 message network good morning lewis your job should you decide to accept it is to infiltrate into the royal military 
 college at kingston your mission is to mould the minds of those young crimson tide officer cadets who might have 
 regimental 0:regi 0:mental aspirations you should also be aware that this posting is your just reward for all of those 
 years of tasteless rmc jokes and ring knocker bashing as always regardless 0:regard 0:less of whether or not you are 
 discovered we will continue to deny your existence this tape will self destruct so what could i do with no 
 more pay incentives and no ips offer there was but little alternative the hand of the regiment had reached out 
 and grabbed my mere mortal rotp body i the infidel from a prominent civilian university in eastern canada had been 
 chosen unfortunately 0:unfortu 0:nately since my taped orders had all but vanished in a cloud of smoke burned my damn 
 hand too there remained no physical evidence of my covert mission to kingston for two extremely arduous years i skilfully 
 and tactfully managed to infiltrate the hallowed halls of the old eighteen from a vantage point situated above the massey 
 library i was able to observe their sinister college rituals in passing and infrequent conversations with the unsuspecting 0:unsuspect 0:ing 
 i managed to maintain a strict facade for all they knew i was one of them i had learned to 
 speak their language fluendy for only one of the buds could surely have known about such school colloquialisms as the 
 stoned frigit rmc ridmin the college equivalent to the leafs cmc cmr and the cbc although for some reason when 
 i mentioned these terms they were received by rather puzzled facial expressions in my daily endeavours i had managed to 
 deceive the general college populace into believing that i was a post graduate student in the war studies department the 
 guise has succeeded little did anyone suspect that i was an outsider only on one occasion was the security of 
 my mission nearly compromised by happenstance an unsuspecting and rather aged looking meaning his body bore the scars of many 
 poor aircraft exits and rather sloppy parachute landing falls patricia lcol in a size small ranger t shirt sauntered into 
 the college weightroom although these visits occurred infrequently i do believe that he may have been somewhat intimidated by my 
 own extra large black and gold regardless his untimely posting overseas negated the possible threat to my exposure to further 
 convince the sceptics i actually attended the spring convocation as a graduate in addition much to my own surprise i 
 had joined the ex cadet club which goes to show the lengths that one must endure to maintain the aim 
 the non believers had been silenced i was in the next step was to further infiltrate the college infrastructure but 
 where to with a copy of sydney frost s once a patricia and jack english s on infantry in hand 
 i stalked mackenzie building through the combined process of special forces target analysis and deductive reasoning i had reached the 
 bold but somewhat obvious conclusion the only patricia officer at rmc should reside in the commandant s office damn it 
 was occupied upon further reflection i then decided that perhaps a less conspicuous 0:con 0:spicuous place to hang my beret 
 was in order the mlm department it was perfect military leadership and management who would suspect me of all people 
 teaching leadership i even managed to obtain the departmental answer to the question what do you know about leadership 0:leader

 clinic for all senior officers this event was wrapped up with a well received flow of cold beer compliments of 
 the patricias rss montreal hey guys don t forget us by capt s folkins the isle of montreal was the 
 scene of some serious rss handover this summer after two years with the royal montreal regiment capt matt macdonald and 
 heather high tailed it for the foothills of alberta and 1 ppcli the reins were left for capt steve folkins 
 the initial stage of the handover consisted of welcome aboard here s your office how s your french i m 
 outta here naturally the follow up was a phone call from the army of the west and you thought bum 
 out syndrome applied only to those in high profile jobs have they devoured your 2 i c yet the scenario 
 at the black watch was different but with similar results capt pat weir left his better half behind in victoria 
 to tackle montreal alone he arrived at his new post to find that his predecessor had already left after spending 
 a year with the kilted militia regiment capt john ferraby jumped at the position of so3 infantry airborne at fmc 
 these days it s not hard to locate sso dist 1 he s usually over at the black watch consoling

 restricted mandays on top of that changes and adjustments are in the wind with the establishment of secteur de lest

 frequent liaison to reminisce of past exercises in wainwright the home station and to reassure themselves that we won t

 of these schools the number of regimental activities are relatively limited nonetheless the regimental spirit and pride lives on in 
 all of us as the french language students are forced to endure the hardships of the course e g apple 
 picking in rougemont rallies in the metro and numerous other gruelling and demanding social cultural activities we really do look 
 forward to our returning to regimental duty although we are not soldiering this year at least we all dream about

 the challenges of 1992 3 rar the 3rd battalion has had a varied year in 1991 the soldiers have as 
 usual performed lo their high standard and much has been asked of their patience and endurance throughout the year the 
 battalion has seen a steady influx of reinforcements and the trial of a direct recruiting scheme over the last twelve 
 months the battalion has had elements deployed to malaysia and hawaii whilst internal training has taken place at such diverse 
 localities as woomera in south australia tindal in the northern territory and canungra in queensland wherever possible the troops have

 the army s annual firepower demonstration at puckapunyal have given soldiers the opportunity to show off their skills on a 
 bigger stage support to the royal easter show and other smaller activities have helped to maintain a closer relationship with 
 the public in less happy times soldiers from 5 7 rar mech have worked tirelessly and often unpraised assisting victims 
 of australia s harsh extremes of nature notably through bushfire and flood relief all told 1991 has been quite a 
 hectic year for the men of 5 7 rar mech numerous challenges have kept the battalion on the move but

 papua new guinea their task was to train approximately 300 soldiers for the pngdf the second team deployed on the

 of the battalion s current commitment in png for the remainder of the unit it was a training year of 
 intense activity with the ever present frustrations of manning and equipment shortages the training emphasis was focused around section platoon 
 and sub unit activities these activities included numerous live fire practices the culmination being exercise otbo 91 this exercise was 
 conducted in the shoalwater bay training area and concentrated 0:concen 0:trated on platoon and sub unit live firing advance and 
 attack this also included apc and helibome assaults august saw the arrival of approximately 100 reinforcements 0:reinforce 0:ments these soldiers 
 being the successful graduates from the direct recruiting campaign they were quickly organised into their sections and platoons and were 
 soon in the field with the battalion for the 6th brigade camp the camp allowed the battalion to work at 
 platoon and sub unit level building the necessary spirit and team work required for an infantry unit the calcination of 
 the camp saw the battalion conduct a mounted attack for many of the soldiers this was their first opportunity in 
 this form of operation internationally the battalion was very busy apart from the aatpt png the battalion also had a 
 composite spt b company group participate on exercise pac bond in hawaii individual deployments saw officers and other ranks of

 in 1992 8 9 rar will commence conversion to a ready reserve battalion as part of the 6th brigade this 
 is a result of a major australian defence force structure review which was conducted in 1991 the ready reserve concept 
 wui see soldiers serving a twelve month full time service period and a further four years part time service the 
 ready reserve will provide the battalion another challenge a challenge the old dependable will surely overcome 22
