 roderick murchison of the royal geological society selected the twenty three year old james hector for the palliser expedition because
 of his medical and natural science training love of the outdoors powers of observation and penmanship skills by late 1857
 the palliser expedition had reached western canada the field men were hector eugene bourgeau thomas blakiston and john sullivan under
 the supervision of captain john palliser only palliser and hector remained with the expedition for the full three years the
