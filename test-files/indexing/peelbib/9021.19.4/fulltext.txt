 inconsistency but also for the high handed practice of invading the sanc tuary of private residences the police who apprehended

 the respectable party it is not difficult to conjure up visions was unified in its desire for a more of
 a baneful judge legislating morality responsible civic government it was to a recalcitrant town in retrospect it far from unanimous
 on the delicate quesis equally plausible to see travis as an tion of the judiciary s right to regulate archetype
 of victorian propriety an some of the more convivial aspects of anachronism in a community which was human behavior travis
 failed to make still geared to the relatively unrestricted this distinction nor did he realize that freedom of the frontier
 one has only to he may have been the unwitting medium note the apprehension which greeted his by which intra
 town rivalries were exappointment to calgary in july 1885 acerbated to a man who saw issues to realize that many
 locals believed that in clear and uncompromising terms such a transplanted easterner was coming nuances simply did not exist into

 alone in his september 1885 the same month that stand his error came in failing to inter travis arrived in

 this was enough time for him to establish a solid base of public support appraise the situation it may not

 jan 6 1886 6 enough statement when one considers the fact that clarke was a lawyer s son and was
 supposedly well versed in the practice of law if one accepts clarke s statement then the full irony of the
 travis affair becomes apparent cast in the role of scapegoat travis obliged his malfactors by hoisting himself on his own
 petard it cannot be denied that travis un wittingly made himself the instrument by which territorial grievances were heightened both
 the unfairness of the liquor law and the poorly constituted territorial judicial system were thrown into sharp relief by travis
 actions in 1888 the canadian house of commons saw the incident as a prime example of the ill defined responsibilities
 of the press towards the process of law yet it seems equally significant that a small town of less than
 a thousand souls could polarize so markedly and exploit during a brief period calgary had two official the situation to
 further individual intercity councils george murdoch led the one ests by this criterion alone the urban which won at the
 polls while james reilly nature of early calgary could be seen above led the group which was recognized by judge

 instrumental than causal the polemical nature of the press at that time heals and salves seven years time it followed
 logically that the later travis was back in town enjoying minority journal should support the mm his unprecedented 700 a

 edited by hugh a dempsey alexander culbertson was one of the great men of the american fur trade a chief
 factor for the upper missouri outfit in the 1830 s and 1840 s he carried the fur trade far upriver
 and was noted for his ability to deal with the warlike plains tribes culbertson was born in chambersburg pennsylvania in
 1809 and after serving in the florida indian campaigns he went to st louis to begin a lifelong career in
 the fur trade he was in minnesota territory in 1830 31 and joined the upper missouri outfit as trader in
 1833 serving the blackfoot and mr dempsey is director of history of glenbow alberta institute calgary and is editor of
 alberta historical review above is a view oj a black foot camp near the international boundary photographed four years after
 culbertson s trip 8 other tribes at fort mckenzie until 1836 he then was promoted to the position of chief
 trader and in 1840 became factor of the main post on the river f o rt union located on the
 present boundary between montana and north dakota he was considered the best man the company stated one historian so in
 1843 he took charge of fort laramie in the service to regain the trade for returned to fort union a
 year later and to revive business at that point he blackfoot trade accordingly he built fort lewis in 1845 but
 finding the loca then decided to concentrate upon the tion unsuitab e he moved a short distance downstream and erected
 the historic fort benton so important was culbertson to the trade that he was appointed agent for the u m
 o in 1848 and became responsible for all posts on the upper missouri and yellowstone rivers during the next few
 years he travelled thousands of miles across the unmapped wilderness as he visited the posts and carried the returns downriver
 to st louis he met the indians in their camps stated his biographer entertained distinguished visitors of all professions and
 attended to the business of his employers cit all times his knowledge of the indians and the western country was
 considered alexander culbertson in 1855 based upon a sketch by gustavus sohon superior to anyone of that time and his
 ability as a horseman and buffalo hunter was never equalled for years culbertson became a wealthy man and in about
 1840 he had married nato yi s isik sina or holy snake whose brother was head chief of the bloods
 in 1855 he was instrumental in negotiating the first peace treaty between the blackfoot and the united states government he
 travelled to washington tc urge congress to appropriate sufficient funds for the treaty securing 80 000 foi that purpose and
 assisted with delicate negotiations with the tribes shortly afterwards he and his family moved to peoria illinois where he had
 a number of investments and properties however many of his projectt failed to produce the expected profits and by the
 late 1860 s culbertson wa deep in debt although he lived in peoria he continued to travel regularly tc the
 upper missouri so he never fully retired from the fur trade by about 1868 he and his family were back
 in the west while creditors were clamoring fo the remainder of his estate it was at this time in july
 and august 1870 when culbertson was sixty one years old that he made the trip recorded in the following account
 later he continued to trade on a minor scale and was interpreter at various indiar agencies before going to the
 home of a daughter in orleans nebraska where he died in 1879 ‘ mcdonn cli mrs anne editor the fort
 benton journal 1854 1856 and the fort sarpy journal 1855 1856 contributions to the historical society of montana vol 10
 1940 p 240 ‘ ibid 9 in this account culbertson reveals a considerable amcunt of information about his own experience
 and feelings obviously he had a great affection for the native people and noted with sadness their inevitable extinction from
 the face of the earth he deplored their treatment at the hands of the american government and believed they should
 be told that the soldiers would not attack them again unless the blackfoot started the trouble he frequently mentioned the
 kind treatment accorded him by the blackfoot and obviously appreciated the generosity of people who made any effort to welcome
 him or make him comfortable from his statements culbertson showed that he was not familiar with the arid region south
 of medicine hat but when his party reached the belly and bow river areas he was in a district which
 he must have visited many times historians tend to think of southern alberta as an unknown land dominated by the
 blackfoot until the coming of the north west mounted police yet many americans must have frequently visited there on trading
 expeditions from the l 830 s through to the 1870 s when in the area near the present milo alberta
 culbertson said knowing this country well i knew that tomorrow night would bring us to a spring of good cold
 water two or three days later they found the indian camps at the exact place i expected i might find
 them these obviously were the comments of a man who was in familiar territory trying to determine culbertson s exact
 route is difficult for his information is sketchy at best while his mileage estimates are somewhat inaccurate however he does
 provide a number of key landmarks sweetgrass hills pakowki lake bull s head hill chin hill little bow river and
 blackfoot crossing these enable the historian to trace a general route but not to pinpoint it with complete accuracy interestingly
 enough culbertson passed within about 25 miles of fort hamilton later fort whoop up the first american fort within the
 heart of the canadian blackfoot hunting grounds but made no mention of it he likely knew of the post and
 perhaps this is why his two points of trade were far enough away from it that the indians would be
 willing to barter also he made the pointed statement that his was not on a whiskey trading expedition for his
 only alcohol was a keg of very palatable wine which he made from service berries culbertson s original manuscript is
 in the collections of the missouri historical society in st louis and is reproduced with their kind permission information about
 the existence of the document came from the montana historical society which has a typescript of it the manuscript itself
 has been edited only where necessary in particular punctuation has been added spelling corrected i e buffloe watter verry etc
 and limited alterations made where the original text was either unclear or rambled to a point of confusion generally however
 culbertson s account was concise and literate and required relatively few changes attempts also have been made through footnotes to
 follow the party s route although in places the exact location is open to question considering the paucity of documentary
 material on southern alberta prior to 1874 this account must be considered a valuable addition to the published records although
 the journey was made only four years before the advent of the north west mounted police it was at a
 time when the land was still a terra incognita in the eyes of most of the world the editor 10

 we started over the same monotonous were would not drink it we however country woodless and waterless tothrough necessity went
 to work and by ward evening we fell upon the dry bed dint of perseverance dug a large hole in
 of a large lake 8 on examination no the sand from which we obtained an water was to be found
 but it was too abundance of good water for ourselves swampy for us to cross this obliged and animals us
 to follow it up for some ten miles this river some ten miles above this where it narrowed and on
 the dry is a fine running stream with gravelly bed we had no difficulty in crossbottom but no timber running

 the mouth of milk river this river un apparently it was impossible without like its northern sisters is well timbered
 shattering the wagons all to pieces and a favorite wintering quarters for but cross we must was the order so
 indians buffalo being generally plenty on we went slowly and cautiously until in the winter season we got over with
 only the hounds of here we cross the river and leave both wagon tongues broken these by it as our
 course is in a northerly the aid of raw buffalo hide was soon direction the bluffs along the river be
 mended and as strong as ever here ing somewhat high it was some time we made our first dry camp

 as our party mules included no longer felt jaded animals required a little rest as their suffering for want of
 water so we well as ourselves all moved on with increased vigour after our repast i took a stroll to
 we had some trouble with our shatan adjoining hill where i could have a tered hounds these however with our
 distant view of the country climbing buffalo bull raw hide was soon repaired to the highest point i discovered in
 the this raw hide for wrapping a splice distance the dust flying and the buffalo or break about a wagon
 is even better running which they never do unless than hoop iron and is invariably used pursued this soon convinced

 were delighted had been driving and sent him off on to hear they were once more near where my horse

 hill where anxious than the rest took a stroll and he stood but in a minute he started soon returned

 i saw three people on horsesatisfied us that tomorrow would bring back sure enough a short distance us to the

 the the same direction we started only to morning found us under way as the find a waterless camp for
 the night mornings as well as nights had become after travelling about 12 miles we came very cool soon we
 fell upon a large to the bed of what was once a running spring with sufficient water but only of
 river but now perfectly dry there the kind we had been drinking the was not a drop of water to
 be seen animals here from dint of thirst drank consequently our mules is doomed to pretty freely another thirsty night
 we have still a the country here became more open small quantity of water in our kegs and our view
 less obstructed by the but this is barely sufficient to relieve bluffs of this dry bed which for some us
 from suffering to any extent hoping way past we had been travelling up that tomorrow would bring us to water
 as it apparently took us in the right we all lay down to pass the night tho direction as we
 advanced however rather in a dull mood we knew water its gradual diminution convinced us we was scarce throughout the
 country and were fast approaching its head or source it was a mere chance if we got any the alkali
 springs with their scanty tomorrow however trusting to luck we supply of water arising from these hills made an early
 start in the cool morn were now very plentiful but the ing following up this dry river until water the
 long use of which as well we reached where it forked one going as its unpleasant effect the oftener we

 it increased direction the bluffs not abrupt were our desire after so long suffering to see some hundred feet high
 either side with once more some bubbling brook even a luxuriant growth of grass and every fresh water without bubbling
 would appearance of springs flowing from have satisfied us after so long privation them we found however after visiting we
 were evidently now leaving our them they were all dry continuing on alkali region and getting into an open i
 discovered a herd of antelope which country far in the distance were some convinced me water was near as those
 high ranges of hills which we imagined animals would not remain in a locality was what the indians called the
 chin without water so i sent the boy on to so without hesitation we travelled in see if any was
 to be found he soon that direction until the sun went down returned saying there was water plenty when we
 again without water camped we hurried on until coming to the spot in the vicinity of these hills we had
 where a large pool of water lay but however the consolation of knowing we after drinking of it we found
 the taste were not far from belly river so the of alkali though not unpleasant as we next morning one

 they were drank very spar he said he could see the high bluffs ingly of it we remained here for

 belly river with of finding better water when we made anxiety and elated with the certainty camp for the night
 but after travelling of soon drinking and bathing in the until sun down we found no such luxury awaiting us
 so we made as they say probably a dry branch of forty mile coulee in their country another dry camp
