 roundup at yaha tinda by j fred scott in 1917 jack clarke and i went to lunch at the a
 limited time to remove their horses and a herd palliser hotel in calgaiy where we ran into of cattle which
 they ran there norman luxton from banif i had been in a war the cattle were sold to whispering dave
 time air crash in belgium and then caught fever mcdougall a rancher and brother of the rev john resulting in
 hospitalization and three months sick mcdougall this was a spooky herd of about one leave in canada when luxton found
 that i had hundred most of which had been raised inside the spent most of two years on the jarboe
 horse and mountain range cattle ranch near bindloss he invited me to join i was told that wild horses had
 existed in the an expedition to go to the ya ha tmda to catch wild ghost river area long before
 the first settlers horses arrived and some of them undoubtedly found their it ll settle your nerves and make a
 new man way into the yaha tmda pocket in addition when of you he advised all you need is your
 bedroll the brewsters obtained their lease in 1908 they and riding clothes we leave from morley in two brought in
 about sixty mares two grey pereheron days the yaha linda was named by the stoney james frederick scott 1892 1982
 was born in indians and means mountain prairie at that meaford qnt and came to alberta in 1911 he served
 overseas in both world wars and was corntune it had been under federal lease to the brewster manding officer of
 the calgary highlanders he pracfamily as a winter range for their saddle and pack tised law in calgary where he
 was active in military horses during the off seasons from tourist work in and business circles col scott prepared this
 article the banff park as told to me there had been a in 1967 as his own centennial project and
 placed it in the glenbow archives above is the yaha tinda cnange of government at ottawa which led to the
 with ranger howani cane s station in the foreground cancellation of brewster s lease they were given stallions and a
 standard bred stallion called brush which in turn necessitated tightening their equidor this was the foundation of the yaha packs
 after about fifteen miles we made camp linda herd at the bar c ranch here jackie fuller a young the
 entire purpose for our expedition was chap from banif who had worked with luxton prompted by the demand for artillery
 horses in arranged to get an extra saddle horse for himself france and the obvious supply available in the from
 eddie bowlen it was a bay called dog yaha tmda the three partners who organized the we continued on our
 way and by the thini night hunt were norman luxton bill logan and pat we had crossed the red deer
 river at wahpaypah bowlen together they paid the brewsters 1 000 linda and stopped at logan s this was some
 ten for the right to bring out all the wild horses that miles east of the entrance where the red
 deer cou ld be caught by the year end river breaks through eagle pass into the yaha to luxton the
 hunt was at once a challenge tinda here we met ed thompson known an adventure and a soutte of profit
 bill logan familiarly as boney thompson who was huntlived on the red deer river at wahpaypah linda ing deer on
 the clearwater at the time he was sour grass prairie at the outer entrance of the an experienced rider with
 a background of earlier yaha linda he had an intimate knowledge of the experiences in catching and bringing out horses
 range land inside the mountains and had earlier from the yaha linda range norman hired him experience in bringing out
 horses to morley at with his big sorrel mare big sis his ranch he had some intermediate pasture and each
 night we camped we usually sat around from his range cattle a good supply of meat for the fires built
 near our tents where we heard stories our party of the early days as told by harrison thompson pat bowlen
 owned the bar c ranch which was and luxton with added contributions from the inone of the few stopping places
 from morley north dians among the stories was one told by harrison to the yaha linda and the necessity to
 use his of the exceptional elk horns which he had cached supply of hay and his saddle horses and a
 very awaiting the day when elk hunting might become good rider named eddie row to go with us made legal
 these tales all left an indelible impression him a natural partner in the project with me i offered items from
 france and of sub i was at morley on schedule and helped as the marine attacks on convoy crossings the
 yip stoney indians in our party packed tents food yip yip yee eye the coyotes vesper equipment and oats for
 the saddle horses here rolled down the river to fade in the distance i had my first lesson in throwing
 and tying the the next morning we went back across the diamond hitch an indispensible education in the river through
 the six mile flats past wildhorse use of pack horses for the mountain trails inex creek and then picked our
 way some seven miles perienced pack horses may wander off the narrow through solid timber down to the river with
 mountrail and tangle against brush or trees until retrieved tains on either side of us we went through eagle so
 packing had to be well done pass and out into the wide plain of the yaha linda to reach the
 yaha tinda a new forestry trail from there we followed the river some two miles ran north along the ghost
 river from the indian across bighorse creek below the falls and on reserve for some eighty miles through virgin pine
 to scalp creek we continued along scalp creek forests it went through places where the light northwesterly and pitched our
 tents near the hardly penetrated and where the continual whisper government ranger s cabin occupied by howard of wind and
 moving tree tops reached down to cane and his wife there we found a useful barn the narrow winding horse
 trail as it contoured and some small corrals each day the horses had around hills and along streams well stocked
 with become more settled down and our general effitrout we formed quite a procession made up of ciency had improved
 pack horses dispersed with indian riders the after we had entered through eagle pass we participants in the business venture
 and four ex began to see bands of horses most of these perienced cowboys john hunter a stoney indi wasted
 no time in disappearing over the slopes an rider could do the interpreting or up one of the many streams
 that ran down to our first day s trip was of necessity the shortest the plain i marvelled at the
 thick cover of grass which indeed suited me delays in packing the which obviously could have supported a great equipment
 problems with fresh and partially number of cattle brewster s small herd of fairly broken pack horses and some saddle
 horses which good herefords demonstrated how well finished had to have a buck taken out of them held the range
 cattle became on this grazing land up our start then there were interruptions on the a large holding corral was
 built against scalp trail when raw pack horses wandered off into the creek where a perpendicular bank of about twelve
 2 author fred scott got his first lesson in throwing a diamond hitch when the party assembled at morley in
 1917 feet from the creek bottom formed the eastern the timber on the mountain face where the fire side giving
 us about thirty acres or more of good had burned out the forest grazing an old fence which had existed
 there had the plan was to ride out in two parties to the to be repaired and passages to the
 creek had to ends of the wings and after dropping off a couple be fenced the main round corral had
 to be recon of stoney indians at the ends to fan ar ound structed under thompson s dir ection with
 several several of the herds which occupied the bottom strong posts securely planted relatively close to lands even with these
 herds there was a constant the corral fence an effective squeeze gate and alertness as evidenced by he fact that
 one memseveral stalls in the adjoining log barn were built ber of the band was always on duty when matters
 in the squeeze was made by having a swinging appeared satisfactory to this self appointed guargate which could close against
 an animal and dian he would begin to graze off toward the herd make him quite helpless while his tail
 or mane whereupon some other member would become was being thinned or for saddling or general uneasy and would take
 up the outlook position veterinarian work it was a beautiful sight to watch such alert sentries much of the hillside
 and some of the lowlands our first day s drive was relatively uneventful were covered with fallen timber from a
 forest fire and was so successful that it seemed to be all too which had swept through some years before
 easy we had some thirty head in our corrals that some stark tree trunks still stood but most had night
 several of these had girth or saddle scars fallen in a maze of bare logs for several days indicating that
 they had left the tame herds these the indians were busy with crosscut saws and were quickly added to our
 saddle string as we were axes while jack fuller and i dragged the logs into continually under strength from injuries
 and over position with lariats tied to our saddle horns the work while the fencing continued he cowboys other s
 were busily engaged er ecting two snake commenced halter breaking and pr epared for the fences running out at a
 wide angle from our main removal of the captives to the railroad corral entrance toward the mountain base to the
 halter breaking was accomplished by tying a north and east horse rather short to one of the posts inside the
 after several days of hard work by everyone corral one of the indians using a gunny sack we were ready
 for our first drive with our would fan the horse until he was no longer able binoculars we had spotted
 several large bands of to fight the tie he then was put into the squeeze horses including some which were
 grazing above gate to have his mane and tail thinned to make him more attractive and saleable when finished he
 might have raw fetlocks and possibly be raw in places where the halter had cut in at different times in
 preceding years attempts had been made to catch and take out some of the wild horses the harsh methods used
 became apparent to me when during a scouting r ide i came across the whitened bones of two horses the
 rawhide neck straps with an attaching chain wound around a sapling showed how they had been tied together to be
 driven out they had apparently broken away and had come to an unfortunate finish in our first drive we brought
 in only one pair of horses with their tails together with a rope after the neck pieces had broken from
 thompson s knowledge and experience it had been decided to hobble the horses a sheep lined hobble was placed on
 one front fetlock and a short line run to a rawhide halter the danger in this was that in a
 few cases a grazing horse would move one ‘ foot over the hobble rope resulting in both front scott right
 talks with bill logan at their camp on scalp feet being tied short to the halter when this creek happened
 any attempt to handle the horse would result in such a jerk on the neck that the vertebrae which were
 well worn game trails would be dislocated near the withers this left a from our tents we had observed a
 large herd kinked neck which jerked up and down in a of horses whose range lay above the timber and
 crazy manner even after the halter had been a plan was worked out for their capture a draw disconnected among
 the riders gave me the job of making a after about a week work with the first bunch wide appr
 oach and a climb above the herd below of horses arrangements were made for them to me indians were directed
 to various lateral game be taken out with the cattle herd among this trails to turn the horses down and
 out into the open group of horses was a splended percheron type area where they could be herded down to
 the mar e which had r eceived a kinked neck she wings there the best riders were stationed to was
 quite played out a few miles after going up drive them across the plain into the corral the hill so
 we had to leave her at a small indian openings shack and corral when we returned the next i was
 in position at the appointed time and from morning she was alive but the magpies had eaten there i started
 one of the most amazing rides i ever the flesh from part of her head and she had to be
 made shouting aloud as i dashed down through destroyed no wonder the rancher hates the and over fallen timber immediately
 a loud magpie whistle of warning sounded out from the wild the rest of the horses were taken some twenty
 horse band and they were off for a few minutes miles to the corrals at logan s place and then
 they i feared they were going to outflank me but luckily were driven down to morley for final breaking i
 was riding a well known brewster saddle horse there they were sold at 98 each to government named lally which
 had been caught in the first buyers for service in france as artillery horses run he knew the country and
 how to deal with having disposed of the first group of horses fallen timber although a gelding he had been
 our attention was directed to an extension of this the leader of one of the bands we had captured success
 our second drive took place further inside earlier holding his position probably from sheer the mountain pass just beyond scalp
 creek here meanness the mountains to the west ran down to the red i barely managed to turn the herd
 and then went deer river opening up beyond a dry creek bot down the mountain after them as they followed
 torn whose sheer banks on its further side extended a game trail soon they had quite outdistanced me a ll
 the way south to the river to the north and and much of the drive was over when i finally
 east of our camp the mountains were heavily came out into the yaha tinda at the base of the wooded
 but higher up was fallen timber through mountain unexpectedly however i became 4 involved in the final run results a
 start would be made with a dozen horses the band had been turned across the plain by and would wind
 up with two or three in the corral the riders but had run into a muskeg where the at the
 same time some dissension was developing original band of about twenty animals had split among the partners into three bands
 one of them numbering seven the reason the going was not so good in the went to the east one
 of the same number ran to outer valley was that many of the animals had the west and the remainder
 were temporarily held withdrawn up the valleys and gorges however up in the bog lands in the centre the eastern
 when we crossed scalp creek we found a different group had outdistanced the riders and as i came type of
 animal further west across a deep dry out of the woods i met them white with lather creek bed and
 over a saddle of high ground lay walking up the bottom slope they were quite an inner area where the
 horses had abundant finished and it was no problem for me to haze pasture land in an area of about
 six square miles them off to the east where the other riders joined it was obvious that the percheron stallions
 had left me and we followed the snake fence straight into their mark in this inner tinda whereas those in
 the corral area the outer tinda had shown more of the rating of among these horses was a very beautiful
 sable the standard bred in the inner area we found a brown mare she had been leading a small rem
 predominantly better hunter type of animals nant of a band and had earned her leader ship by mostly grey to
 iron grey in colour her speed and stamina as we drove them along a plan was developed that seemed to
 be a good the snake fence feeling quite sure we had them one at a rather precarious crossing which the
 in the bag this animal made a determined ef horses had picked down into a dy gulch well fort to
 leap the log fence she did not make a clean camouflaged corrals were built among the trees jump but hit
 the top log turned over and lay for in the bottom these were left open so the animals some few
 moments outside the corral before rising could pass through and a supply of oats was left to her feet thompson
 and i rode in with the rest there to encourage them of the band changed to fr esh mounts and
 were a good game trail led along the dy creek line soon following this mare along scalp creek from the
 timber edge jackie fuller was stationed hoping to turn her back she reached the river against the timber a lmost
 on top of the rise which where the bank was low and presently she crossed led over to the valley
 floor where the hor ses to the opposite bank wher e she came ashore grazed his job was to turn
 the band away fr om there she stopped and looked back as if to say the trail that led into
 the wooded hills to the north well i m staying in the mountain r ange and the other riders went
 up to red deer to the west she walked off into the trees under cover of timber and fanned out
 beyond the after the first two relatively successful drives wild band after we were all in position we moved our
 subsequent roundups produced disappointing forward and when jackie looked over the rise to some of the wild horses captured in
 the roundup s ere photographed as they forded the red deer river 5 see if anything was developing he saw
 a band of twenty three hunter types with flowing manes and tails running along the trail which crossed through the
 fallen timber in order to try and turn them away from this trail and from moving off to the north
 jackie had to pull out and keep ahead of them this he did through much difficult going and continually jumping
 over fallen logs he just managed to turn them but in doing so he rode too fast and too close
 to the edge of the bank i then saw his horse dog stumble and end up at the bottom of
 the gulch with a broken leg with their hazer gone the wild horses continued down the top trail to the
 next crossing where logan had been posted his job was to direct them through the gulch into the corral traps
 which were ready in the timber however rather late in the execution of the plan logan noticed a long pine
 tree at the top of the crossing and thought it might improve his situation if it were felled to cut
 off the trail this thought was being translated into action when the band came on the scene however they came
 from the north instead of from the west as he had expected and arrived just as the tree was falling
 the resulting confusion meant that instead of having one band of twenty three horses there suddenly were twenty three bands
 of one each the drive had been an utter failure during the ill fated roundup thompson had seen the sable
 brown mare alone several times on fred scott in the uniform of the ro al flying corps the other side
 of the red deer river and he was photographed the same year as the wild horse hunt determined to catch
 her there was only one trail along the river on the other side which followed days gaining her confidence by
 watering feeding a relatively narrow fringe of timber at the base and continual handling the normal procedure of of a
 steep mountain accordingly his plan for breaking a range horse followed and when bringing her over to our side was
 simple two thompson finally rode her she had never been riders would cross by a ford which angled like given
 an opportunity to buck a shelf and came out to the west of the area where the sable brown mare
 became widely known the mare had been seen another rider would cross in the cochrane area as mama brewster some
 opposite the point where scalp creek joined the years later when thompson was riding a spooky red unbroken horse he
 was thrown and broke his awaiting developments we soon heard shouts pelvis lorrie johnson then rode mama from thompson and
 saw the mare racing along brewster at a steady lope for fifteen miles to get the river trail until she
 saw the other rider blocking help from the mount royal ranch however her way the river bank was five feet
 above the boney thompson had taken his last fall at water level but she rushed straight out and his funeral
 mama brewster was led behind his launched herself into the swift mountain stream coffin with his cowboy boots reversed in
 the by the time she had crossed she was no problem stirrups for the other riders to control and she
 was left with in our final drives at the yaha tinda there were no alternative other than the corral a
 number of unfortunate incidents but finally with she was anything but docile and her bared teeth a group of about
 thirty head and those of our orikept everyone off the corral fence in the squeeze ginal string which were left
 we moved out to gate she was hobbled and then transferred to a spe logan s place beyond the park
 cially constructed stall where she could not pull i used that day to get fish and meat to take back
 back against the rawhide halter thompson spent to calgar y the junction of the red deer and 6 panther rivers
 marked the eastern edge of the park shape where the elk antlers had gored him we so when i shot
 a mule deer i had to drag him managed to clear away the broken pieces of horn a few feet
 east to be sure i was over the line i and get the horse to logan s but he had
 been too then rode on to the falls on the bighorn and in badly injured and died there a short
 time i had sufficient rainbow trout weigh on the final day of our expedition we started ing from one to
 two pounds to later fill two prune our drive from the red deer river up the long boxes packed with
 ice crystals such a box had winding trail to the bench on top snow had fallen contained twenty five pounds
 of dried prunes and soon the path was packed and icy my own which were a normal diet for a
 homesteader equipment the venison and fish were all under an unfortunate incident occurred on our first canvas cover securely tied
 with a diamond hitch day out with the pack horses i had found an ex as it was a heavy
 load i was using a large and ceptionally fine pair of elk antlers in the woods somewhat clumsy pack horse
 he lost his footing as they were still attached to the skull it was a nd in a series of
 bounds seemed destined for obvious that the animal had been illegally shot a final leap of some sixty feet into
 the red deer these horns i managed to pack into camp as our river however by real luck he ended
 up in a horses were travelling light having no oats to take bunch of small pine trees on a kind
 of ledge it out thompson helped me to tie them over the took us about an hour with several lariats
 tied pack of one of the horses together and two good saddle horses to manage possibly this animal was not
 too well trained to steer and pull him safely pack on the trail as or may have disliked being driven
 out from the the day wore on men and hor ses soon became yaha tinda because at different times he
 would well schooled to the trail and the rest of our return leave the trail brushing the horns against saplings
 to morley was without further incident or trees until they came loose then they slipped i realize that some parts
 of our expedition may from his back and of course they swung beneath not make a pleasant story i was
 a guest with no him where they spooked him into running away authority and i am not defending he methods
 we finally caught up with him in a small clearing which were used nor am i being unduly critical and
 i managed to lassoo him but he was in bad but i have merely provided a factual description of a
 roundup as it actually occurred edmonton in 1883 edmonton the village is some distance below the fort on the north
 side of the north saskatchewan the english church the methodists and presbyterians are well represented here all have good edifices
 and are sound financially there are several stores well stocked with all sorts of goods and grist and saw mills
 any amount of coal can be dug out of the river bank nine miles west of edmonton is st albert
 mission established in 1858 by that most excellent and meekest of men pere ia comb fine flour gold is deposited
 on the bars each year but nobody has discovered whence it comes and tho gold washing has been practised for
 many years in and around edmonton the gain has in no case been sufficient to tempt people to go into
 gold washing as an industry edmonton district is set out in the proclamation of his honor governor dewdney excepting the
 member elected for prince albert the north west council consists of persons holding positions under the dominion government now we
 shall have two men who can call their souls their own when i lived in toronto a witty journalist used
 to say that of ever y hundred men you meet in the course of a day each of ninety nine
 thought the fates cruel that he was not prime minister in a place like this a stimulus is given to
 selfimportance and as the bishop remarked to mc the other day in french and i fear the verve of the
 bon mot will be lost in english in a small pit a little rat looks big already we have ten
 in the field some are openly canvassing what is needed at present in the north west council is brains and
 independence but some of those who aspire are the merest toadies we send you an honorable member for edmonton but
 who he will be it is not for me to say regina leader may 3 1883 7 the oddfellows in
 early calgary by patricia jasen one of the first institutions established in pre industrial england as a jibe at the
 craft guilds calgaiy before the turn of the century was a lodge that excluded the common labourer or the young
 of the independent order of odd fellows such artisan as an organization of friendly societies societies played an important part
 in recreating the which were societies of working people pledged kind of social relationships which newcomers had to provide members
 with financial assistance in enjoyed in their pr evious homes and they pro times of distress its roots can be
 traced to the midvided a sense of security by guaranteeing that or late eighteenth century the oaths of secrecy members
 would receive both financial and emo and the ritualism of the order were typical of tional support in the event
 of misfortune friendly societies and craft unions at that time odd fellowship was introduced to alberta in after the french
 revolution and during the the l 880 s but its origins in england which are somewhat obscure go back much
 farther accord the author who received her ph d and ma in ing to some accounts the order developed cen
 histoiy from the university of manitoba prepared this turies ago as an offshoot or imitation of free paper as a
 research project for the historic sites masonry from which some of its rituals may have service of alberta culture she

 calgary after the iurn of the century odd fellows was adopted by working men in 8 napoleonic wars when the
 british government major reason was the failure to pass the compulfeared that revolution would spread to england soiy medical examination
 imposed to protect the secret societies were suppressed by the authori financial stability of the order from excessive ties and
 many of the odd fellows ea rly records claims on its relief fund 6 were destroyed the ioof was a

 on most of these races and an intense spirit of competition engulfed the camp indian horse races were a time
 for fun and this spirit carried over to the rodeos of the twentieth century but the elders claimed that modern
 horses were not as fast and their legs 3 are too heavy 5 indians also rode unbroken horses and wrestled
 on horseback but these games r i i were not as popular as the races with the arrival of the
 canadian pacific rail ‘ 1 way in southern alberta in 1883 ranching became a financially viable industry and from this
 developed the sport of rodeo a few minor events ‘ ‘ occurred around the province but the first calgary stampede

 became a western frontier extravaganza which was attended by canada s governor general the duke of connaught 1 the four
 indian tribes surrounding calgary were invited to take part in the opening stampede parade but only one indian participated with

 victory proved to final on that fateful september day three per other alberta indians that rodeo was not just a
 sons did ride cyclone spurring him all the way white man s sport his achievement not only made and to
 everyone s delight he stayed with him him a champion but also proved to indians that once the ride was

 success ful during his car eer was that he tr ained his own horse practised long hours went to bed
 early and did not abuse himself with liquor and smoking he went on to say that rodeo is a great
 sport but 1 it is a tough sport and a person had to look after hemselves if they wanted to
 get anywhere his advice obviously paid dividends as his son peter junior a bronc rider nd grandson jordan a steer
 rider both were indian champions in 1966 bruised head s experiences and advice were examples of the positive reinforcements that
 rodeo could have on the confidence of alberta indians a number of other indians were successful competitors in the early

 with a tiny baby and i managed lake after my first summer in a camp wagon in to tell her
 all my trials 1905 my husband told me he had to go across when we first met we ran to
 each other and the line for rams and would be gone for six or put our arms round each other
 s necks and just seven days he took the team and wagon so that had a good cry all the
 hunger and longing we he could return all the sooner all the company each had to speak to a woman
 and had stifled i had was a cat and that was little comfort on for so long gave way and
 we felt better after our the lonely prairie cry she led me to a little cot fashioned out of after
 the first three days i would take the cat an orange box and daintily hung with muslin and in my
 arms climb the coulee bank ever y afternoon there i saw my first little canadian baby and look away to
 the south to see if i could see it was the custom to shelter all those who came anyone coming
 but no matter which direction i to the home or camp about sundown with no queslooked i could see neither
 a house nor even a tree tions asked as to who they were there were a nothing but bald prairie
 on the afternoon of good many horse and cattle thieves in the country the sixth day i had climbed the

 returned to the house a mountie would come and you realized you had and sat down to have a good

 one question generally asked which i thought when i felt a hand on my shoulder i did a silly was
 horrible was are you lousy my brotherthing i fainted it was my husband and he had in law was in
 the camp wagon one night and he been below the hill just as i climbed it which is had murdo

 two riders coming and as he wanted as i did and said he would never leave me alone to spend
 the time with murdo he thought he again would send them away as they rode up to the after he
 had bought the rams he found there camp they gave the usual greeting how s the was a quarantine law

 of time so the custom s that one of the riders replied my pal and i officer took pity on
 him or on me for he told are same him to start going as soon as it was dark and
 to the mountie at grassy lake was very lenient keep going as long as he could he took the hint
 with hor se thieves and i think his reputation for but he said that the next day each time he
 saw that was known he generally gave the horse thief a cloud of dust rise in the south he was

 it quick one of them had his hand 20 resting on the end of his pistol so i thought that
 following as they came to the house i witnessed was good persuasion i asked them if they could the strangest
 sight i had ever seen a proceswait till my husband came home but they said sion of indians with copper
 colored faces feather no they wanted a meal at once so i did not take headdresses and bright colored shawls
 they long to get it wer e under a chief named yellow face they kept plying me with questions what
 was after they had passed my husband came the nearest town did they have a mountie there hurrying home as
 he was sure i would be scared and what was his name after i had answered he told me he
 had asked them to move on west all their questions they went outside to wait till as we were about
 to start lambing but all they 1 got the meal ready and i heard them saying that would answer was
 no savey and by the time i was green and newly over when i had every he returned to the
 lambing shed they had their tents thing ready i called them in after the first cup and tepee up and
 were all set to stay of tea one of them jingled his spoon in his cup in a short time
 a little halfbreed girl who could as a sign he wanted more but i took no notice speak english came
 to the door and asked me i just seemed frozen in the farthest corner from for some potatoes and sugar
 i told her i could them he said tea and i answered there not spar e any as we could
 not get to town again he teapot pointing to the stove i saw him wink till after lambing was over
 at the ot her fellow and then he rose and helped next morning i noticed an indian woman lookhimself after
 they had finished their meal they ing in the south window and another at the north told me they were
 from the fraser river outfit window then the doors slowly opened on each and if i was ever up there
 to be sure and stop side and two others came inside i confess i was in two days later the
 mountie came after them a bit scared then they had a number of articles and when they were cornered somewhere
 near in leather and beading with them and they held macleod he mountie told me that one of them these
 out and said big man say much money shot himself rather than be caught i was never you buy i
 only shook my head no but they called on to appear in court as a witness as the would not
 go away and kept talking to each other mountie did not say i had them at the ranch one of
 them went outside and brought in some one day about the end of april 1906 i was potato parings and
 said some but still i just finishing up a washing when i saw a long line nodded no hen they
 showed me some baby of canvas topped wagons coming up the coulee moccasins pointed to my condition and said ahead
 of the wagons were some men on horse baby i just stood with my back to the stove back and
 a great many hungry looking dogs and kept wondering how long they would stay r i i sheep dominated the
 existence of the author during her earl y sears in alberta this is the md flock at the ranch 21
 when one of them picked up a blanket with a head forward and the shepherd did the rest instead bright
 border from my washing and showed me of the ewe trying to run away she seemed to a handful of
 things she would give me in trade know that we were helping her and did her share i only shook
 my head so after some more gab by lying still it was seldom that we lost either bering they went
 away ewe or lamb it snowed heavily that night so they did not by the end of may my feet
 wer e so badly bother me next day but the following morning swollen that i had to put on my
 husband s slipwhen i was baking pies some little indians came pers and tie them up with string to keep
 them on to my door and i took them in i could not get my feet them to speak but
 after i had given each of them on the fifth of june we cut out the dry sheep a piece
 of pie they all talked at once and hurried and wethers and sent them to another camp i was out
 of the house in a short time i had quite a standing outside the corral keeping the wethers number visiting
 me and all saying pie i real from jumping when the panels gave way and i ized i had started
 something and when i had given was knocked flat on my back with sheep running them all a piece i
 had to start and make some over me as i was pregnant we decided then to more start that night
 for lethbridge to visit the doctor during the storm some lambs were born prema i went home to prepare for
 the journey and to ture and the men threw the carcasses over the get the supper ready we had to
 keep our meat panels of the corral the indian women came and and other perishable food in the cellar so
 i asked got them and after skinning them they pegged my husband to get me some meat and he cut
 it out the little skins to dry and took the rest to their on the top step of the cellar
 then went out i had tents when the storm was over they took down forgotten to ask him for butter
 so i was just going their tents and moved on by that time many of down for it myself when
 my foot slipped on a them could savey quite well and knew all that piece of suet and down i
 went to the bottom was said luckily i suffered no ill effects from either when lambing started i had to
 go to the camp accident a mile up the coulee to cook in a tent our bed next morning we
 went to the sheep camp to was in the campwagon deliver some food and then three miles west of after
 the first week it started to rain and never grassy lake to the campbell camp to get their stopped for
 sixteen days that was in may 1906 order for goods from lethbridge it was after soon the coulee was running
 and all the sloughs seven in the evening when we finally got to grassy were full i was doing my
 best to save the chilled lake there were no restaurants at that time so lambs by giving hem whiskey and
 water feeding we made our way to the shack of the cpr operait from a spoon we had to give
 it up however tor adam galger who acted as postmaster too as the lambs were dying despite all the care
 the train didn t come till 2 a m so my husband i had lambs lying all over the tent
 floor some put his fur coat down on the floor and i rested in boxes and other wrapped in sacks
 a nd the badly there even the hard floor felt good to me that chilled ones i laid on the
 oven door for a short night time till i heard their bleat when we arrived at lethbridge we made for
 the men came in soaked to the skin every night the lethbridge hotel the leading hotel at that and the
 tent was like a laundry after they got off time as i was tired after the long drive in the
 their wet clothes and hung them up we had to lumber wagon and the train journey i was glad turn
 out every article of clothing we had at the to get to bed next forenoon i visited the doctor house
 and share it with the men and made arrangements to go to a nursing home as my husband and his
 brother were rather tall in lethbridge by the middle of june it did look funny to see men with clothing
 sizes lethbridge extended only as far as the barracks too big for them and the pants tied up round the
 of the mounted police and the hudson s bay knees to keep them from tripping over them stor e was
 a plain wooden building there was so it was during this first lambing that i got my much mud opposite
 the lethbridge hotel that a first lesson in midwifery when a ewe could not man with a team of horses
 just waited there and lamb herself perhaps by reason of the lamb as loaded wagons came along he hitched his
 team coming wrong or the legs twisted my duty was on and pulled them through i lost my rubbers to
 assist as i had a smaller hand many times i while crossing from the hotel to higinbotham s took a
 piece of string with a noose on it and after drug store i never did find them pushing back the
 lamb i would feel for the fore it rained all that day so although it had been feet and slip
 the noose over them then help the almost a year since i had been away from the 22 when the
 author went to see the doctor in lethbridge the city was a sea of mud this is a view of
 round street about that time r anch i could not enjoy myself we stayed only found mice all over the
 house one cupboard was two days in lethbridge and then returned to filled with seeds flom the weeds and the
 mice had grassy lake when we got there the rain was made neat little nests all over a packet of
 rice still coming down in a torrent as we got off the had been left in another cupboard and a
 lthough train we met the section boss mike who told us the packet was still standing upright on the shelf
 hat he had a load of ties for us a mile up he track the rice was all gone i
 noticed that the trunk as it would mean a ten mile drive back again from where i kept my linens
 had not been shut tight he ranch and it was a busy time we decided to and when i opened
 it i found where the rice was go for them even if it was raining stored and to my gr
 eat grief many of my wed after we had loaded the ties in the wagon we ding gifts were nibbled
 where they were folded had to put the seat up on top where i sat on a and were render
 ed useless cushion but the rain soon soaked it and made it by the time we reached our home after
 driving ver y uncomfortable after he had gone a few ten miles in the rain i was thoroughly soaked and
 miles on the way home i heard a loud damn ver y cold when i went into the house i
 found and on asking what was wrong i was told that one of the north windows was broken and the
 rain a lovely patch in his hat had sprung a leak and was pouring in on top of the trunk
 where i had a river had started down my husband s back i the clothes for my new baby there
 was water had to laugh but he did not see the funny side all over the floor and no dry
 kindling to make a of it fire when i looked round and saw the back i should explain the r
 eason for the patch when bedroom had been turned into a sheep pen i just i had taken my husband
 s hat out of its box gave up and bawled ther e were some poor ewes the only one he
 had i found that a mouse had and lambs that had been chilled in the rain storm eaten a neat
 little hole in the front of the brim so the hired men had moved the furniture out and this was
 really a calamity but i got a piece of put the sheep in black silk and gummed it neatly over
 the hole my husband ordered me to bed while he it could still be seen quite plainly so i turned
 the managed to get a fire started and mercifully i fell hat back to front and changed the ribbon on
 the asleep for several hours when i got up the sun ba nd this was all right while it was
 dry but driv was shining again the sheep wer e gone and the ing home in the heavy rain the
 gum had got hired man was washing he floors soaked and the patch came loose the following sunday june 10
 th i went to i had soon found out that mice were no res mrs slawson s for butter and
 found the family pecters of people s clothing after being away that starting to plant trees for a grove nothing
 would first summer at the sheep camp i got home and do but that i would plant one for luck
 which i 23 this is a view of the neil s spread which they called the cumbrae ranch did and
 in later years this grove was quite a picnic section house the rest of the time shearing lasted ground as
 the trees provided shelter from the sun grassy lake was very small at that time but while i was at
 slawson my other neighbour it soon could boast of a hotel some grocery stores mrs clark wit h her husband
 and baby came and a dry goods store and a bank the majority over they were on their way to
 visit us so we of the early settlers there were mormons and they decided i would drive home with mrs
 clark built a church which was also used as a school while the two husbands went in our wagon william
 salvage of grassy lake had started the after i got home i started making supper but first store but at
 the ranch we found we had to did not feel ver y well however i did not say fall back
 on the mail order house of stanley mills anything just before we all sat down murdo and company even though
 their catalogue didn t campbell came along later the men went out contain pictures of hats or dresses to see
 some colts while mrs clark and i washed for a good number of years grassy lake had he dishes she
 noticed that i was uneasy and some excitement to look forward to when the offered to stay with me but
 i thought i would be shearing season came along there were generally all right four or five bands of sheep
 sheared just south of when the men ca me back the clarks went the village and as the shearing crew
 was quite home but murdo stayed to spend the night it was large together with the flock owners the place
 well that he did for he had to make a quick trip was quite busy they even managed at that
 time for mrs slawson who acted as m idwife for all to hold a celebration on the 1 st of
 july with sports the women who had babies at grassy lake bur of all kinds including hor se r acing
 and bucking deft and winnifred she got to our home a little horses so hat i had some idea of
 what the wild before midnight and the baby was born shortly and wooly west was like after on june 11
 th 1906 my sister in law and i got one of the men to as she was a very busy
 woman mrs slawson drive us to grassy lake to see the sports one year could stay only eight days and
 then my real as we got into the village we were met by a man problem began for i had
 never looked after a who was well known for playing jokes he young baby also shearing had began at grassy
 advised us to go home as jim was dead drunk and lake so my husband had to be at the
 shearing bob was in the snake room we didn t know what pens as each rancher helped his neighbour to
 do as his story was quite a shock to us but the after a few days alone the section boss
 s wife hired man said not to believe him as he was only heard that i was at the ranch
 wit a new baby and kidding so on we went and found both husbands no help so she sent for
 me and i stayed at the just getting up from dinner both dirty and greasy 24 after working with the
 sheep dead sheep when a blizzard came up he just had we had wondered what to wear to the stampede
 time to get a coat and a lantern and make for the as we imagined it would be a dressy
 affair so we band my brother in law was herding them but both wore light dr esses ground length large
 pie the snow was drifting so badly that it was imposture hats and sunshades all relics of city life sible
 to see in front of you a nd it would have been back home in scotland everywhere we went we
 hard work trying to hold the band alone heard people asking who are they and after some time we heard
 a bump at the door someone answering oh they are the sheep and then it opened and a man tottered
 in cover ed men s wives we felt rather foolish as the other with snow and hardly recognizable he was
 our women were wearing print house dresses but it neighbour fr ank clark who had been bringing was a lesson
 to us and we never forgot it us some oats for feed when he got lost in the bliz we
 had a mormon crew shearing for us in zard his hor ses had been going round and round 1906 and
 one day i went to watch them work till they went into the coulee and came to a stop i
 had my little baby with me and the cook was at our door he was badly frozen as he had
 not teasing me about having made a start with a dressed for a blizzard the sun had been shining family
 and advised me to raise a large one i said when he left home only thr ee miles away we
 did one was enough for me and she surprised me by all we could for him and after a rest
 he felt better saying her grandfather was the father of 72 chil but not foolhardy enough to go out in
 it again dren i exclaimed seventy two and she said the wind did not die down till ten o clock
 that yes he had nine wives night and frank went home to a very frightened the winter of 1906 and
 1907 was the hardest wife she had about given him up for lost i ever experienced we had very little
 hay up that the sheep came trailing in too and my sisteryear as the stock running wild on the prairie
 had in law and i were happy when we heard their bells destroyed a lot of our stacks and knew
 our men were safe they had been able the winter started early and we were quite to hold the sheep
 against the banks of the coulee unprepared for it by the beginning of december and the lantern had kept their
 hands warm we were feeding the sheep we bought a stack we had been without mail for weeks so jim
 of hay from a dr tuller north of burdett and decided he would go to gr assy lake to get
 some had two of the settlers south of grassy lake ed he told us not to worry if he did
 not get home johnson and charlie attwood haul it for us as that night as the trails were so heavy
 with snow they had a bob sleigh and good horses many a it would be hard going and he would
 have to give night we listened for the sound of the bells of the his horse a rest horses returning
 and then let the sheep out to he left grassy lake late in the afternoon and feed only to find
 that the sleigh had upset or the rode alongside the railway track till he got to a horses were played
 out the wind blew from a mile from burdett then he started south to the different direction almost every day
 so that new donaldson farm they had dug out for a house trails had to be made every morning at
 that time and with snow everywhere it was hard the sheep began to suffer so much from hunger to locate
 jim walked about for a long time and that they started eating the wool off each other s then started
 calling hello hello but no one backs as they stood in the corral it was a terrible answered he began
 to think he was really lost sight each morning to see dozens of sheep bare on the prairie and as
 a light snow was falling and bleeding and if any sheep had died during again he did not know which
 way to go he got the night there was no wool left on the side turned off the horse and
 had only walked a few steps up when he disappeared into the snow the noise he we cut out the
 sheep each morning and those made then got the family awake and after one with the wool eaten off were
 put in little pens of the men got out through the skylight on the where they could get shelter from
 the cold and roof he helped jim out of the hole he had fallen wind and where we could feed
 them we had into the entrance to the house it had filled up with to make sacks into coats for
 some of them or they snow so they used the skylight on the roof to get would not have had
 any chance to survive out and in they soon got ji m some supper and towards the end of january
 they were dying at after talking for some time they all went to bed the r ate of 20 and
 25 a day and we could not keep again jim felt he had really something to be pace with skinning
 them we ordered feed from thankful for that night as he had a narrow escape lethbridge but it did not
 come till april when from being lost a thousand sheep wer e alr eady dead the first chinook came on
 feb 6 th 1907 and one day my husband was skinning some of the we went to our own home
 to get some coal 25 james neil the author s husband is flanked by w barry and john mackenzie as
 they examine a merino ram on the neil ranch having moved early in januar y to my brother in an
 hour before we got the sheep inside the corral law place our house was surrounded by cattle again it was
 only after my sister in law had many of them dead and not a pane of glass was carried a
 handful of hay through the corral that left in any of the windows the curtains were the sheep followed she
 had brought me a coat eaten and the tassels off the blinds and every and cap but my hands and
 face were badly thing that the cattle could reach i had left some frozen i felt as if i had
 a pot on my head for many dish cloths and soap on the little kitchen dresser days afterwards believe me
 i always dried my but these too had disappeared hands before going out again we boarded up the windows while
 the water after the first chinook the prairie was in a much dripping from the roof soaked us by morning
 worse condition than it had been before even the there was hard frost again but as we drove back cattle
 could not break through the ice for feed and that night to my brother in law s the water was
 were dying all over the range it was a common splashing all over our little sleigh sight to see a
 long line of cattle going south one i got a real taste of winter and frostbite that year day and
 back north the next as the wind changed one day it was a cold 30 degrees below zero with some
 of the cattle went mad from hunger and had a strong wind blowing from the south east we to be
 shot one steer got into our band of sheep tried to put the sheep out against it in the morning
 and it did not matter how far the men drove him but were beat and we had to put them
 back in in the morning he was back by night again and the corral my husband went for hay to
 a stack as he ran through the sheep he broke the legs of a mile away but before going he
 told me to watch several of them that the sheep did not get out of the corral and we came
 on eight head of cattle one day down to where the weak sheep were backed up against a snowbank in
 a buffalo wallow i was busy washing for the baby when my and snowed in we had quite a time
 digging them sister in law called out that the sheep had broken out but if we wouldn t have they
 would have the gate of the corral and were out i did not think stayed there till they had starved
 or frozen of dr ying my hands or putting a wrap on me one each morning after tucking in my
 baby to keep thought was uppermost if these sheep got down her warm my sister in law and i each
 carried a to the stack they would trample the weak sheep bundle of hay on our backs and threw it
 out by to death i ca lled the dogs and we fought for nearly the handful so that the sheep
 would follow while 26 the men went ahead with a snow plough trying to cut the snow down to the
 grass many times the horses would walk on the top of the snow and ‘ ‘ never crack the ice
 left by the february chinook and at other times they would fall through and come up with bleeding legs as
 we used the stables for the weak sheep the horses had to stand tied to the hayrack all night where
 the sheep ate the hair off their tails as far f up as they could reach it certainly gave the
 horses an odd appearance the chinook came for a second time on march 25 th 1907 and by nightfall the
 coulees were run ning so we decided to make for our own home it again i bundled up my belongings
 and made ready while my husband hitched up when he came for me he said i could drive the wagon
 while he would go on horseback driving the horses and cow i did not know much about driving so i
 let the lines go slack and allowed them to go round the end of the wagon tongue as i headed
 for the end of a dam or rather what had been a dam the water was coming down like a
 river and i had no idea where to cross i had visions of us all being tluown in the stream
 so i gave a scream and the hor ses stopped my husband heard me came to my rescue and piloted
 me across after that he gave me a lesson on holding the lines tighter so that they would not get
 mrs catherine neil round the tongue when i got home i found it surrounded by dead sheep to get rid
 of some indians under chief yelcattle and some had to be taken away befor e i low face came along
 again and seeing a chance could enter the house the water was coming of making some money they offered to
 skin them down the coulee with such force that it was as the carcasses thawed out they skinned or carrying
 dead cattle with it i was able to stand pulled the wool pegged the skins neatly on the on the
 top of the hill above the house and count ground to dry a nd spread out the wool everyone 58
 dead cattle helped and when all was finished he chief told some of the cattle ranchers lost very heavily us
 what each had done and he or she was paid in one blizzard alone 400 head of cattle went over
 accordingly after they were all paid the chief the bank at cherry coulee north of burdett and saw where hey
 could make a little more money piled up dead at the bottom the section house so he told us sun
 come out sheep smell very at grassy lake was covered with brands cut from bad missus get sick we take
 all away for ten cattle killed on the track and one house north of dollars judging from the smell one
 dead sheep gr assy lake had the cellar filled with dead cattle can make we wer e glad to pay
 they took them they had gone inside for shelter and had fallen away sever al miles east and piled them
 up in a through the floor rather than pulling them out coulee and when the first homesteaders came in he
 owner moved the house and saw the bones they thought it was where a when lambing came our sheep were
 in such massacre of indians had taken place poor condition that the lambing was a failure it after such a
 heavy loss as we had during that was a common sight to see a herder catch a sheep winter of
 1906 07 it was like beginning all over and almost strip her bare with his hands they were again our
 slogan was save and buy sheep it did shedding wool so badly the ewes didn t want not seem much
 of a hardship to do without things heir lambs and the lambs were too weak to rustle as we always
 looked forward to a time when we so added to all the other work was the suckling could visit our
 old homes in scotland and we of most of the lambs if we wanted to save them knew that it
 would take a lot of money after the hard winter there were still the dead for several years the indians
 came round each 27 spring hunting for coyotes and the chief always my knees washing the floor and again the
 incame to visit us if any rams had died during the troduction was meet mrs neil the chiet winter we
 always kept the heads for him bowed to me and then turning to my brother in the first time chief
 yellow face came he went law he shook his head and said nitchie good to the sheep camp first where
 my brother in law man he only one squaw white man bad he many and his newly arrived bride were
 staying he was squaws he soon found out there was another introduced to her meet mrs neil later on mr
 neil he came down to my home where i was busy on to be continued a calgary character a unique

 way to england unlike the majority of holiday travellers his man richard king by name had an outfit that made
 him very conspiciuous and nearly everybody in the depot rudely staied at his make up king is from the far
 north west his home or rather his ranche is in calgary just outside the north eastern boundary of british columbia
 being used to roughing it king did not wear a semi dress suit for travelling instead he wore a regular
 ranchman s outfit he had on a pair of loose fitting golf trousers which were buttoned below the knees bright
 red woollen stockings served to keep the travellers legs warm and he wore a corduroy coat about which was a
 belt of the same material a checked overcoat and moccasins of moose hide were part of the costume mr king
 left his calgary r anche saturday over the canadian pacific railway he arrived in buffalo and was to have taken
 a train for rochester at 9 45 o clock but it was an hour late while waiting for his train
 king took out a clay pipe and puffed lazily at its short stem a curious crowd gathered round him while
 he related several stories of the north west he spoke of hunting and the west weather the former he said
 was good the latter bad severe winters are given us up there said mr king between puffs the weather gets
 very cold and storms are frequent early in november of last year we had an early run of cold weather
 the thermometer registered about 40 degrees below zero i was caught out in this chilly snap mr king said he
 wore a pair of leather boots and his feet were frozen he spent a week in the hospital and as
 a result of the misfortune lost the nails from his tees one day when king returned from the town house
 his hired man was semi intoxicated and the weather was 41 degrees below zero the servant had all the windows
 open but they were speedily closed by their owner king said that several people perished in the cold being caught
 out while they were intoxicated king expects to leave on the campanis for england the above paragraph refers to r

 years having come down some time ago to one hen which he has had out on shares for about four
 years it will be remembered hat he created a sensation here about a year ago by applying to the authorities
 in new york state for the revolver with which he shot a man over 20 years ago he is a
 great character and is well known to all calgarians his figure is well known upon our streets in the costume
 described he invariably pulled after him by a string a little halfbreed irish dog for which he displayed great affection
