 111 colonel in chief princess patricia s canadian light infantry the countess mountbatten of burma cd jp dl during 1986 
 i was able to visit my patricias on both sides of the atlantic again which makes you all seem much 
 nearer in july i visited third battalion in victoria and felt very proud to see them performing a beautiful sunset 
 ceremony in the setting of expo 86 in vancouver which the public much appreciated the next month my husband and 
 i joined the second battalion in germany to spend two days with them on manoeuvres in hohenfels this was the 
 first time i had really been able to do this during my twelve years as colonel in chief and i 
 enjoyed the experience greatly so did my husband who was reminded of his own wartime service days as a captain 
 0:cap 0:tain in the coldstream guards we found being able to drive apcs for considerable periods over quite rough terrain 
 at times to be a very exhilarating experience it is very good to be able to join my patricias in 
 so many varied activities and to see you all on the job in so many different ways i send my 
 warmest wishes to all of you and your families a h 
 iv colonel of the regiment princess patricia s canadian light infantry colonel w b s sutherland cd i am so 
 very grateful to have been your colonel these past four years they have been very happy years for helen and 
 me the regiment has been our home for the greater part of our lives and thus it was with great 
 joy that we agreed to serve again when called upon to do so it all seems so short a time 
 ago now sadly for us the time has come when we must bid you adieu we do so with memories 
 of a thousand happy occasions and secure in the realization that while we are stepping down we will always be 
 family a most happy and sustaining thought for us one is normally expected to say something profound on leaving an 
 honorific post by your leave however i would ask that you permit 0:per 0:mit me to leave with you one 
 or two impressions i take away with me concerning the regiment i am firmly of the opinion that the regiment 
 has never been stronger than it is today i am convinced that it will continue to enjoy a secure and 
 honored place in the life of our country great challenges much uncertainty and equally great opportunities lie not far into 
 the future the regiment has ever been equal to these in the past and our guarantee that it will continue 
 to be so is manifest in the potential and opportunity when the proper moment arrives that has always been characteristic 
 of patricias i am certain on the basis of everything i have seen and know of you that the regiment 
 will not be found wanting when duty calls the second of the impressions i would leave with you gives me 
 much personal satisfaction increasingly over time the regiment has come to regard itself as a family by doing so it 
 has become greater than the sum of its parts it is no longer this battalion or that branch it gives 
 every evidence of being a community of mutual interest and affection perhaps because the regiment has come to represent an 
 ideal in our lives the notion of community has become central to our personal value systems as well when members 
 of a regimental family come to regard themselves primarily as a community there can be little room left for unproductive 
 rivalry jealousies and alienation the last of my impressions concerns what i consider to be the enormous importance to we 
 patricias of the values and traditions left us from the past these are the personal legacies of our first colonel 
 in chief our founder a hamilton gault and the originals a regiment s public persona is what those serving would 
 have others see or think of it but it is also what those in the regiment s past will have 
 made of it service in the interest of our country and the cause of freedom being always leaders in our 
 profession and doing our best always no matter what the likely cost or how great the odds these are the 
 notions passed on from the past that have inspired successive generations of patricias and always will there are other things 
 i would say and probably should perhaps when helen and i do our final round of visits there will be 
 time to do so one thing however simply cannot go unsaid we have been treated very well indeed and given 
 every possible support and courtesy during our time with you we could not possibly were we given a hundred years 
 in which to do it begin to acknowledge or repay the thousand debts of kindness we owe i can only 
 tell you that it has touched us deeply and shall remain in our hearts always

 jp dl national president ppcli association only two years remain until 1989 and the celebration of the 75th anniversary of 
 the founding of the regiment i feel it appropriate 0:ap 0:propriate therefore that my message this year address the anniversary 
 0:an 0:niversary and the significance of the event to our regimental family vice patrons brigadier j a de lalanne cbe 
 mc ostj ed major general c b ware dso cd major general g g brown ostj cd we in the 
 association believe that our regimental family is comprised of a serving and a retired component the latter is represented for 
 the most part by members of the ppcli association 0:associa 0:tion regretably however there are a great many retired individuals 
 0:in 0:dividuals who have not retained any links with the regiment it is the very strong belief of the association 
 that in many respects the events planned throughout 1989 should be aimed at reestablishing 0:re 0:establishing contact with these individuals 
 in the hopes that our association numbers might be bolstered and family ties strengthened colonel of the regiment colonel w 
 b s sutherland cd national executive president mr r m middleton cd 6407 70th street n w calgary alberta t3b 
 3j5 in the eyes of some a 75th anniversary is not particularly significant they would have us believe that we 
 should save our money and energies for a really big show in our centennial year 2014 what these individuals fail 
 to grasp is the significance of the unique opportunity presented to us in 1989 vice president mr c a h 
 kemsley cd 80 glenmore drive west vancouver british columbia v7s iab 1989 is in all likelihood the last opportunity that 
 we will have to gather together in one place representatives from every generation of the regimental family we are fortunate 
 that there is still a number of ww i veterans who are sufficiently active to join in our celebration with 
 the passage of time the possibility of meeting with those who developed the heritage that we are tasked to uphold 
 becomes more remote by the year 2014 there are likely to be few surviving veterans of the korean war let 
 alone those of earlier service it behooves us all to become acquainted with our lost cousins and to nurture our 
 common bonds before it is too late vice president east dr j pariseau cd 1668 grasmere cres ottawa ontario xiv 
 7t9 during the weekend 10 13 august 1989 the association will in conjunction with the first battalion host a national 
 reunion in calgary the intent is to bring together as many individuals as possible who have ever worn a ppcli 
 hatbadge at the cornerstone 0:cor 0:nerstone of the celebrations will be the opening of the new museum facility additional activities 
 that will take place during the weekend include a regimental trooping an all ranks dinner and dance an association dinner

 8 i have seen hammie gault commodore w p hayes ret d there are two karsh portraits in the small 
 upper hallway of my home on the south shore of nova scotia one is that indomitable 0:in 0:domitable canadian brigadier 
 andrew hamilton gault known to all as hammie the other is of his elegant and talented english wife dorothy blanche 
 known to her friends as db they gave me these pictures of themselves at the end of world war ii 
 and they continually remind me of one of the happiest associations of my life one that covered nearly 20 years 
 but i don t really need them as reminders as my memories of hammie and db are always fresh even 
 though he died in 1958 and she some years later i have been asked to write some anecdotes as remembered 
 by a young canadian sailor of the founder of one of canada s most distinguished regiments the princess patricia s 
 canadian light infantry which he raised and equipped 0:equip 0:ped at the beginning of the first world war with his 
 own funds there can be few now serving in the princess pat s who had the luck to meet hammie 
 so if i can in a small way bring to life some part of his personality i will have achieved 
 my aim it is for me a rare privilege to write about hammie and in doing so to write about 
 db for i can t think of one without the other i will not write about his legendary feats in 
 battle in world war i because those are part of the regimental history and of course because i was not 
 there i first met hammie and db at their estate hatch court in somerset just before christmas 1939 at the 
 time i was a 19 year old royal canadian 0:cana 0:dian naval cadet from the royal military college commencing 0:commenc 
 0:ing my training with the royal navy my home town was swift current saskatchewan and i had not travelled much 
 naturally i was impressed with hatch court and might easily have been overwhelmed by it had it not been for 
 the warm personalities and easy charm of my host and hostess at that time hammie was 57 in the winter 
 of 1939 hatch court was fully staffed butler valet footman chauffeur and several maids naturally we dressed for dinner there 
 hadn t been many butlers in swift current so all this took a bit of getting used to i could 
 not have imagined that this would become my home away from home in england or that one day hammie and 
 db would become visitors to my house or houses in canada indeed 0:in 0:deed on occasion hammie had cleaned and 
 cooked a fish for me and thought nothing of washing the dishes also he became my oldest son s godfather 
 but these things were still long in the future at the time i speak of then in wartime as the 
 staff gradually left to join the armed forces or otherwise to apply themselves to the war effort we still solemnly 
 dressed for dinner and served ourselves and carried out the dishes i have been asked why hammie gault took an 
 interest in me a naval officer and i think the answer is that he took an interest in just about 
 everybody and everything but particularly 0:par 0:ticularly he seemed to have an affinity for young people in addition he had 
 a number of friends who were ex cadets from the royal military college which he thought very highly of and 
 he never seemed to tire of asking me about it he also had that rare quality of making whoever he 
 was talking to feel they were the most important and interesting person in the room everything about hammie was on 
 the grand scale he refused to have any limitation imposed on him by the loss of a leg he rode 
 to hounds and with db flew a light plane a gypsy 0:gyp 0:sy moth the two of them among the 
 earliest private licensed pilots in england he was also a champion on the squash courts men would have followed him 
 anywhere and i suspect women would have too 
 9 in addition to many other accomplishments hammie was a brilliant extemporaneous speaker he had been of course for many 
 years the very popular member of parliament 0:parlia 0:ment for taunton from which it would follow that he could make 
 a well polished and powerful political speech but i heard him once deliver a toast to the bride when one 
 of his nieces was married it was no doubt the wittiest i have heard other than my wife i think 
 db was the most attractive woman i have met she was an aristocrat small and slight with iron hands clothed 
 in velvet she could handle horses and people with the greatest ease and she rode her favorite hunter butterfly as 
 she drove her large gate shift bentley with great skill and very fast i couldn t handle either and one 
 day butterfly a huge and mean beast left me hanging from an oak tree i don t think hammie ever 
 did anything in an ordinary way if it could be done with style although he had a rolls royce he 
 seemed to prefer to drive about the somerset lanes in his dog cart drawn by a fat little pony it 
 was on one of these outings that we stopped somewhere for refreshment and i casually admired his handsome pigskin wallet 
 which he had designed to hold the old english five pound note a few months later when i had returned 
 to my ship a similar wallet arrived with my initials on it among his many activities hammie had become a 
 successful 0:suc 0:cessful big game hunter between the wars and his many trophies animal heads were mounted and displayed in 
 what was called the orangery in one of the curved wings of the house with this in mind some years 
 later when i was visiting hammie in canada i told him with some pride that i had been shooting the 
 greater snow goose at cape tormente this great warrior looked at me sadly and said yes bill when i was 
 your age i enjoyed shooting but now i have no desire to kill anything i confess that i am beginning 
 to share his feelings 0:feel 0:ings and i don t know whether it is just old age or some wisdom 
 or understanding that comes with it in the postwar years hammie renewed his interest in his large estate at st 
 hilaire in the eastern townships of quebec this is a spread of 2 285 acres and includes a mountain with 
 a lake near the top of it he kept a small sailing dinghy there and i have often sailed and 
 gone swimming with him he had a great sense of humor he called his artificial leg horace and when he 
 went in swimming would leave horace standing at attention as a sentinel one weekend my wife and i were visiting 
 with our four year old daughter jane hammie and i were just coming out of the lake from a swim 
 when jane came towards us hammie was in high spirits and in a sense of fun waved horace towards her 
 but it was too much for the child and she took off at high speed terrified poor hammie was even 
 more upset and indeed dejected it took several hours to reach a happy reconciliation the last time hammie and db 
 were coming to visit us in ottawa in the spring of 1958 fate intervened they were to come to us 
 from st hilaire for the weekend and we had arranged 0:ar 0:ranged a small prank of a kind i thought 
 they would enjoy our close friends and neighbors were captain n j c scruffy 0:scruf 0:fy o brien later admiral 
 and his wife stephanie i was a commander at the time scruffy owned a long black cadillac and offered to 
 provide it and himself as a chauffeur stephanie offered to act as maid both would be suitably dressed we all 
 had great fun working out the details for a planned dinner party but it was not to be just before 
 hammie 0:ham 0:mie and db departed the forest on one side of mont st hilaire caught fire and was not 
 fully under control for several days soon after i was appointed to the united states naval war college in rhode 
 island and while i was there hammie died in the royal victoria hospital in montreal he left st hilaire to 
 mcgill university i look back at hammie and i see a brave and gallant soldier a powerful and compassionate leader 
 of men and a most thoughtful and generous gentleman always a gentleman my conclusion here i can take from hammie 
 gault himself from the words of a letter he wrote to the widow of colonel herbert molson on the colonel 
 s death in 1938 to us all he ever stood sans peur sans reproche for everything that was fine and 
 great and true the very best that canada produces the passage could describe hammie 0:ham 0:mie himself i feel the 
 spirit of andrew hamilton hammie gault pervades the regiment yet long may it be so

 administration prior to waincon 86 the company broom i 100 and floor hockey teams won their respective league trophies while 
 in the military sphere the company was again awarded the hamilton gault skill at arms trophy for being the most

 0:wright with a sqn of the strathconas supporting the militia combat team commanders course initially the candidates were overwhelmed by 
 the size and complexity of a combat team and several amusing moments were enjoyed by all overall the company participated 
 in some excellent mechanized training and the course smoker revealed the high regard in which we were held by the 
 candidates in august alpha company honed its patrolling skills during 0:dur 0:ing a two week patrol school we enjoyed the 
 pleasure of humping 100 pound rucks over the rugged terrain of the rocky mountain house area dining on cold imps 
 operating in darkness and fending off mosquitoes large enough to carry away small warrant officers by the way warrant thibeau 
 was rescued the final company fighting patrol was a classic example of solid preparation and rehearsal coupled with timely 0:time 
 0:ly execution the enemy force occupying the ram river bridge was completely surprised and surpressed by a murderous 0:mur 0:derous 
 blanket of covering fire from the support group which enabled the assault group to capture the objective and prepare it 
 for demolition as we withdrew sounds and smoke from the smoldering bridge gave all involved a deep sense of satisfaction 
 even a company relaxes occasionally fall was highlighted by our defensive exercise although training was limited to the sarcee training 
 area the exercise confirmed the company s ability to prepare a defensive position 0:posi 0:tion and execute defensive routine the 
 exercise will be remembered for the soggy patrols the spartan nbc decontamination 0:decon 0:tamination centre and of course the brigade 
 commander s visit where it was noted that he was not fond of wheelbarrows or wine cellars the fall was 
 also noteworthy athletically our rifle and pistol teams under the expert guidance of sgt riches confirmed 0:con 0:firmed that alpha 
 company is the best in the regiment the floor hockey team also pocketed a battalion championship our french grey cup 
 tradition of victory continued with 2lt robitaille selected as the offensive player of the game wo thibeau chosen as the 
 most valuable player and a tipsy pte macphail named the parade queen another french grey cup victory the oc buys 
 alpha company then headed to the ghost river area to conduct its winter indoctrination the training was highlighted by 2lt 
 robitaille s lesson on the limitations of grizzly mobility and mcpls gibson and primmer s bear exploits as scouts on 
 the final fighting patrol the year ended with an enjoyable christmas party as alpha company finally relaxed and reflected upon 
 the past year s activities bravo company 1986 began not with the new year s ball but with a bug 
 out for ex nordic strike at zero dark thirty on a monday morning when the last elements of bravo company 
 arrived on the battle position we found ourselves required to defend ourselves with three platoons of four trenches each plus 
 odds and sods from company headquarters additionally each platoon had its own counter attack force consisting of platoon commander signaller 
 and the merciless platoon warrant nevertheless with such gallantry did we fight that the hapless enemy was defeated and put 
 to route in only ten days reach out and touch someone oc b major r romses following ex nordic strike 
 and the subsequent oei bravo company shipped off its soldiers to attend the standard variety of courses the majority of

 four weeks training including a combat team live firing attack 0:at 0:tack and battalion and brigade ftxs where we tested 
 our skills in carrying out assault river crossings you mean the enemy is over there our return brought preparation for 
 the trooping of the colour parade in spite of temporarily losing the two smurf guards to the aircraft search operation 
 in kananaskis the battalion showed up in full strength on 27 june at this time we also welcomed our new 
 oc maj r l schutte and 2ic british exchange officer capt j d a ramsbotham the company then set out

 entered a month of patrol training followed by a month of intensive training in defensive operations during one of the 
 wettest septembers on record october and november were taken up with the second yearly pcf cycle in which bravo company 
 was tasked to run the avgp driver course finally came preparation for ex rapier thrust 87 1986 will be remembered 
 as a year of innovative training that tested the skill and professionalism that continues to be the hallmark of the 
 busy bees bee all you can bee 
 14 charlie company 1986 was a very busy year for all beginning with ex nordic 0:nor 0:dic strike conducted in 
 wainwright during the last two weeks of january it was during this exercise that a new hairpin design trench was 
 tested by members of the company 0:com 0:pany explosive digging augers and shaped corrugated iron were the order of the 
 day luckily the weather was bearable and all went well the spring pcf cycle found the company doubly tasked with 
 two avgp serials lt oliphant and lt taschereau ensured 0:en 0:sured that all the candidates received the maximum amount of 
 time behind the wheel the weather co operated and even in the badlands of wainwright sunglasses were sop during tactical 
 driving i hope i brought my swimming trunks a c coy grizzley prepares to swim after the pcf courses tne 
 company worked on section and platoon battle drills for waincon the first few days were spent in polishing platoon and 
 company sops charlie company was also responsible for conducting live fire stands all the companies that rotated through the ranges 
 agreed that the training was realistic intense and valuable the grenade assault range and the platoon dismounted live fire range 
 effectively tested and challenged even the most experienced platoon and section commander what is it i dunno but let s 
 kill it anyway after waincon soldiers were just getting adjusted to the june heat on the parade square preparing the 
 battalion trooping when they found themselves searching for a downed 0:down 0:ed aircraft in kananaskis country from the spit and 
 polish of parade uniforms two 100 man guards donned their combats to help in the search long days of uphill 
 climbs and downhill trudges in extended line proved to be instrumental in locating the downed aircraft after only a weekend 
 of r and r the two guards were back on the parade square in spite of the unscheduled interruption the 
 trooping was a major success trooping the colour ist bn style following block leave the company conducted refresher defensive training 
 in sarcee and prepared for ex yukon warrior a two week sovereignty exercise conducted 0:con 0:ducted in the yukon yukon 
 warrior required extensive preparation and planning and charlie company honed its skills in canoe and assault boats on the rivers 
 and lakes around calgary the trip to ross river required two c 130 chalks the air force providing its usual 
 service as for the exercise itself the plan was simple canoe down the pelly river a main artery of the 
 yukon river and halt along the way for the occasional 0:occa 0:sional patrol and the testing of fishing equipment the 
 csm seemed to have the most luck and in combination with other lucky fishermen there was always enough fresh pike 
 and greyling to fill all frying pans 
 15 just another hard day s work for wo sirois single file down the pelly river in the yukon although 
 the rapids were few and far between the long days of canoeing and patrolling were challenging enough the wildlife landscape 
 people and customs of the yukon were a welcome break the exercise offered each man a valuable and enjoyable experience 
 to be treasured forever sgt mansbridge and his new platoon c coy shows the flag in fernie b c with 
 the approaching winter the company began its annual 0:an 0:nual winter indoctrination in sarcee tent routine shelter construction 0:con 0:struction 
 and patrolling were all faithfully drilled into each soldier the men s christmas dinner marked the passing of another year 
 on a high note and as usual the company had lived up to its tradition of pride and professionalism combat 
 support company picking the high points of this challenging and satisfying year is no easy task particularly so since each 
 of the support weapons platoons has had a different perspective on the battalion s 0:bat 0:talion 0:s many activities ex 
 nordic strike saw moments of high excitement and bone numbing weariness for armour defence platoon one such moment came during 
 the battle group withdrawal when poor old 55a gave up the ghost right in the path of advancing 0:ad 0:vancing 
 enemy hasty destruction techniques were hurriedly brought into play as 55a s stalwart crew prepared to abandon 0:aban 0:don ship 
 and lose themselves in wainwright s frigid wastelands 0:waste 0:lands for mortar platoon the high point was the illumination shoot 
 in support of the battle group defence niner said let there be light and there was but pioneer platoon has 
 the most indelible memories of this exercise as throughout the battle group area their expertise along with substantial quantities 0:quan

 mortar platoon to shilo for ex limber gunner newcomers to shilo and the artillery were impressed by the effect of 
 mortar and medium artillery fire and 18 of overhead cover became nowhere near as reassuring as previously ex limber gunner 
 also served to enhance the platoon s standing with the artillery as the mfc s had the opportunity to demonstrate 
 their ability to adjust fire and meet near impossible timings not a pin up in sight callsign 0 on a 
 quiet day meanwhile the remaining platoons settled down to the spring course cycle combat support company instructors and students alike 
 put in many hard hours and experienced a wide variety of rewards including for the tow course the opportunity 0:op

 no i thought i was joining the army pioneer expertise nets another v ton across the obstacle waincon 86 was 
 notable for very early late winter and the amount of time the unit spent studying the aquatic life forms of 
 wainwright s rivers lakes and swamps naturally our very own obstacle conquerors were in the thick of things pioneers expertise 
 served to get the battalion across the final obstacle quickly and if not dry at least not too wet armour 
 defence platoon used the same assault crossing exercise to demonstrate an uncharacteristic willingness to foresake their beloved missile carriers their 
 trek across the battle river with bravo company will be remembered by most tank hunters for years to come a

 remained to ensure that the unit mountain school ran smoothly with the student body going up or downhill in the 
 approved fashion september brought the customary run of refresher training 0:train 0:ing courses cpxs and bug outs the deployment carried 
 out in october was highlighted by reconnaissance platoon s tcp jeeps racing to complete the circuit to the release point

 its platoons could look back on a challenging and satisfying year and await with confidence the challenges of the year 
 to come in addition to the usual spate of exercises administration 0:administra 0:tion company provided critical support to myriad national

 with deployment to ex rapier thrust 86 upon return the unit commenced the first of two primary combat function course 
 phases with the attendant burden of logistical support waincon 86 followed close on the heels of the unit course period

 challenge postscript postscript a busy year ended with the customary festive rituals christmas dinner that touching reminder of the family 
 ties that bind all members of the regiment was the usual happy and occasionally rowdy event but as the beer 
 and turkey vanished and the sounds of christmas filled the air it was time to look back on a year 
 well spent it was also a chance to think on those who had gone before and those whose unstinting 0:unstin

 19 hatch court and hamilton gault major l e grimshaw hatch court it may be a surprise to many patricias 
 and no less so to tourists to find a small but significant part of regimental history 0:his 0:tory tucked away 
 in deepest somerset in the english west country hatch court has played a notable part in regimental history and remains 
 a monument to the founder brigadier a hamilton gault it is a most intriguing place and well worth a visit 
 by any itinerant patricia travelling in britain as with most things in britain the house and property have a long 
 history in saxon times the present village of hatch beauchamp pronounced bechum the norman spelling remains but pronunciation has been 
 well zomerzetted 0:zomerzet 0:ted was called hache meaning a gateway in this case to the ancient forest of neroche which 
 lay a short distance to the west after the norman conquest the manor was held by the beauchamp family who 
 added their name they held many manors in somerset and dorset but hache appears to have been their chief residence 
 a description of the ruin of their manor house written in 1633 places it near the church so it was 
 probably also near the site of the present house in 1361 the male line of the beauchamps died out and 
 the manor of hache passed by marriage to the seymour family 0:fami 0:ly jane seymour third wife of henry viii 
 was their direct descendant and her eldest brother was edward seymour viscount beauchamp of hache and later duke of somerset 
 lord protector in the minority reign of his nephew edward vi by 1633 hache court was a ruin and in 
 1676 once more by marriage the manor passed to the bruce family earls of ailesbury by 1726 the farm and 
 lands near the church were owned by john collins the manor lands having been sold away the collinses were a 
 wealthy llminster family who had made their fortune in the wool trade but john collins began to establish a landed 
 family and acquired hache court a house worthy of his status was required and in 1755 he engaged as his 
 architect thomas prowse of axbridge prowse was an attorney 0:at 0:torney and member of parliament but he was also a 
 capable amateur architect who occasionally designed houses for his friends although prowse may have been an amateur the house hatch 
 court is far from amateurish hatch court is not large but stands out both as a memorial to the west 
 country wool trade and as an illustration of the contribution of cultivated amateurs to georgian architecture the collins family in 
 turn died out in the male line early in the nineteenth century and with few surviving records the subsequent history 
 of the place is uncertain the house was occupied either as owners or tenants by a number of families during 
 the nineteenth century and although this caused some neglect it no doubt precluded much victorian remodelling leaving the house in 
 its present largely original georgian style while the last century failed to provide both a family story and the impress 
 of a great personality which usually distinguishes such houses the twentieth century provided both in 1922 lieutenant colonel andrew hamilton 
 gault married 0:mar 0:ried dorothy blanche shuckburgh whose uncle william henry lloyd had owned and lived at hatch court from 
 1899 until his death in 1917 the gaults lived at hatch court from 1923 bought it in 1931 and made 
 it their home until 1944 when they moved to montreal after the founder s death in 1958 mrs dorothy gault 
 returned to hatch court where she resided until her death in 1972 the house then passed to her eldest niece 
 mrs anne nation who with her husband commander 0:com 0:mander retd barry nation rn has lived there ever since commander 
 nation is an honorary patricia and both he and mrs nation are active members of the uk branch of the 
 regimental association the house itself as indicated earlier is a mid eighteenth century palladian mansion in bath stone in its 
 beautiful setting 0:set 0:ting it illustrates georgian elegance at its best the main building has four square towers with pyramidal 
 roofs and the south front has an arcaded piazza sometime between 1785 and 1829 curved wings were added that on 
 the left being the orangery a victorian term for a well glassed room in which potted orange trees were customarily 
 grown outside is a deer park containing a small herd of fallow deer which has been on the estate since 
 the house was built 
 20 commander and mrs nation at home in the orangery the moct prominent feature of the interior is the central 
 hall and staircase cutting through the middle of the house through a screen of lonic columns the centrepiece of the 
 furniture 0:fur 0:niture is an oak refectory table nearly ten feet in length with contemporary walnut side benches dating from 
 about 1630 on the right side of the hall is a painting of the founder in the uniform of a 
 lieutenant colonel ppcli painted towards the end of the first world war by glyn philpott and which is flanked 0:flank 
 0:ed by paintings of two of his horses by sir alfred munnings on the opposite side the central painting is 
 of mrs gault on st hilaire a horse named after their canadian estate near montreal other historic portraits of the 
 shuckburgh family grace the staircase the hall featuring the 17th century oak table with the portrait of hamilton gault by 
 philpot flanked by paintings of his horses and racing trophies on either side of the hall are the identically proportioned 
 dining room and drawing room the former containing a magnificent presentation casket awarded to the founder on his being made 
 a freeman of taunton the route through the drawing room the library with its gracefully curved mahogany doors through the 
 orangery leads to the china room and the museum there are many who would appreciate the fine collection 0:col 0:lection 
 of antique china displayed in the unique semi circular china room but most would be fascinated by some of the 
 artifacts 0:ar 0:tifacts contained in the adjacent museum commander and mrs nation established the museum in 1973 to house records 
 souvenirs and memorabilia not only of the regimental 0:regimen 0:tal history and the founder s military life familiar to us 
 but also of his political life and his and his wife s love of flying it is a unique tribute 
 to two outstanding personalities for many of us who are aware of hamilton gault through his military reputation as founder 
 of ppcli and colonel 0:col 0:onel of the regiment for many years and who continues to observe us sternly from 
 his portraits it is perhaps difficult to imagine hammie gault the politician on the hustings campaigning 0:cam 0:paigning for votes 
 hammie was a member of parliament for taunton from 1924 to 1935 and the museum at hatch court contains a 
 number of souvenirs from this period of his life as a politician he propounded free trade and empire preference and 
 by all accounts was a first rate constituency mp well loved 0:lov 0:ed by his constituents he resigned from parliament 
 when he was satisfied that he had achieved the political objectives he had set for himself the hall portrait of 
 mrs gault on st hilaire by munnings with chairs used by the gaults at the coronation of hm the queen 
 in 1953 
 21 there was also hamilton gault the pioneer aviator in fact both dorothy and hammie the latter complete with wooden 
 leg learned to fly shortly after the first world war they owned and flew a variety of early aircraft including 
 several moths and a vegas gull as an mp hammie used 0:us 0:ed his airplane as others used a car 
 and would speak in the house of commons during the day and appear in his constituency 0:consti 0:tuency later that 
 same evening having flown himself from london to hatch court a revolutionary activity in the mid 20s the gaults flew 
 themselves all over europe the middle east and north africa hammie usually piloting and dorothy navigating because although he probably 
 would never have admitted it she was the better navigator we all know that on the outbreak of the second 
 world war hamilton gault again offered his services to the canadian army and was accepted but it is probably not 
 widely known that he had first applied to join the rcaf as a fighter pilot but had been rejected the 
 hatch court museum contains a number of interesting relics of the aviation side of their lives including both hammie s 
 and dorothy s flying log books and many photographs the museum aviation souvenirs and log books the museum showing aviation 
 souvenirs and a drawing of mrs gault as a pilot past the west facade of the house the museum and 
 the walled garden a path leads to the mediaeval parish church of st john the baptist the church is probably 
 the oldest remaining 0:remain 0:ing building in the village although it was remodelled in part about 1700 and again during 
 the nineteenth century it contains 0:con 0:tains an impressive list of rectors beginning in 1322 as an interesting 0:in 0:teresting 
 aside of military interest the churchyard contains the grave of colonel john chard vc who won the victoria cross in 
 the historic battle at rorke s drife in 1879 however of most significance for the regiment in the floor of 
 the south entrance is a bronze memorial marking the final resting place of hamilton and dorothy gault mediaeval church of 
 st john the baptist hatch court occupies a unique place in regimental history and is of interest perhaps second only

 allowed for each platoon 0:pla 0:toon in the battalion to match their skills in four areas of expertise 0:ex 0:pertise 
 firstly there was a 16km march in fighting order with a full basic load of ammunition followed by a shooting 
 competition 0:com 0:petition an afv recognition test and lastly a kit check the competition proved to be intense but the 
 clear winners were the members of armoured defence platoon led by capt mark douglas of interest in this year s 
 competition was that instead of 12 teams there was a total of 18 teams competing with the addition of teams 
 from combat support and administration companies as usual special mention must go to the two administration 0:ad 0:ministration teams the 
 transport corps of drums team finished 0:finish 0:ed seventh overall and the maintenance team dubbed 13 platoon finished in eleventh 
 spot i guess it just goes to prove that our administration is second to none all i asked them to 
 do was fix it not anodize it the winning team for the 1986 march and shoot team armed defense platoon

 stories we were entertained on the rugby field by the rgj s and we reciprocated by hosting them to a 
 canadian feast a barbecue overall the battalion had a very successful battle school the sigs o learned how to read 
 a map administration company showed the rifle platoons how to march and shoot the rgj s were introduced to canadian

 s summer training concentration took place this year from 4 19 august 1986 our visit to this land of milk 
 and honey which seems more a land of mud that s runny due to constant use and typical german weather 
 was uniquely marked this year by a visit from our colonel in chief accompanied by her husband lord john brabourne 
 lady patricia s first duty was to review a guard of honour composed entirely of soldiers from administration company after 
 all the dco did say that he wanted it done right for once she and lord john were then whisked 
 off for a roundrobin 0:round 0:robin series of visits to the rifle companies deployed throughout 0:through 0:out the training area 
 each company was fortunate to have the opportunity to host the colonel in chief for several hours after the shortest 
 driver track course on battalion record lady patricia and lord john took control of the tiller bars of c s

 sampled the haute cuisine a la field served up by wo evans cooks from a and b companies lady patricia

 with the velburg golden oldies rockettes if he ever tires of soldiering the following evening lady patricia and lord john 
 attended an outdoor barbecue with all ranks of the battalion during which lady patricia was called upon to present awards 
 to various members of the unit the visit of our colonel in chief and lord john ended all too quickly 
 it is not often that we get to see our colonel in chief in the field it was an honour 
 and a pleasure to host lady patricia and lord john during their visit and we sincerely hope that they both 
 went away with a better understanding and appreciation of what real soldiering is all about is that a beachball or

 direction he provided during his tenure of command the battalion underwent a smooth transition from life in winnipeg to life 
 in germany and earned for itself a reputation for being competent and professional in the field and in garrison lieutenant 
 colonel gray was a staunch supporter of sports at all levels within the battalion and this showed in the many 
 successes achieved by our unit teams the officers and men of 2ppcli congratulate lieutenant colonel gray on his promotion and

 during training at hohenfels i think you point it this way hold it fellows i think i ve got something 
 stuck in my eye hohenfels 86 by lieutenant s vida the battalion participated in the first part of fallex 86 
 which was held in hohenfels from the 4th to the 19th of august the training comprised section through company level 
 tactics culminating in a three day exercise in the german 0:ger 0:man countryside sections and platoons once again had time 
 to themselves 0:them 0:selves for refresher training in mounted and dismounted tactics 0:tac 0:tics and soon remembered all too well 
 the scrapes and bruises which inevitably accompany the seemingly endless yards of fire and movement with section and platoon training 
 completed we moved into company and combat team drills the intricacies of tank infantry co operation are always in need 
 of refinement and proved to be very worthwhile training once the company and squadron commanders finished friendly discussions about the 
 best method of employing each other s forces delta company commanded by major mike austdal had the unique opportunity of 
 having an american rifle platoon 0:pla 0:toon attached for the duration of the concentration this proved 0:prov 0:ed very interesting 
 for both soldiers and commanders because new weapons and ideas were introduced one lesson learned was the similarity of our 
 operating procedures and how this allowed for a smooth integration of our forces i am sure most company commanders would 
 jump at the chance to have a fourth platoon especially with the rather interesting 0:in 0:teresting twists that it allows 
 in combat team tactics the introduction of soviet equipment as part of the enemy force during training added realism and 
 allowed us to see both strengths and weaknesses in the warsaw pact equipment after seeing the btr 60 one of 
 the more common soviet apcs displayed close up many of the soldiers walked away with much fonder feelings for our 
 old mll3s and their relatively spacious interiors with all sub unit work ups completed the battalion moved 0:mov 0:ed right 
 into a two day field exercise many crew commanders 0:com 0:manders sprouted grey hairs while drivers went through the transition 
 from driving in the training area to once again competing 0:com 0:peting with the german civilian drivers for space on 
 the roads the germans also had to relearn lessons since their last encounter with nato forces in the rma and 
 unfortunately 0:unfortunate 0:ly for them the mll3 seldom comes out a loser in a game of chicken fallex part one 
 ended on 18 august and saw the battalion 0:bat 0:talion move back to cfb baden by rail and road the 
 following day it had been a very good concentration which allowed us to prepare for the rapidly approaching second part

 and various other hands on activities it was an opportunity for us to impress our families and friends with what 
 we do to earn a living and show them our equipment much to the surprise 0:sur 0:prise of many an 
 officer some of the ankle biters proved to be more adept at handling the small arms than some of the 
 soldiers a popular attraction for the prospective rambos was the death rope slide set up by recce platoon also on

 drill competition it proved to be the highlight of the day with colonel w b s sutherland our colonel of 
 the regiment in attendance to present awards the process of building the winning team began weeks before the competition each 
 company chose thirty men from the numerous volunteers at their disposal to form their team then the standards of discipline 
 mental awareness and attention to detail were honed to produce a winning team the actual competition consisted of a detailed 
 inspection 0:inspec 0:tion and set drill format then each team performed an individual 0:in 0:dividual display of precision drill which 
 was definitely the highlight of the competition some movements left the audience 0:au 0:dience in awe and the sergeant majors 
 no doubt proud when the dust settled and the points were tabulated a company s 0:com 0:pany 0:s team this 
 year led by sgt black had won the competition 0:competi 0:tion for the second consecutive year it was a very 
 close competition 0:com 0:petition and congratulations go to all teams for their outstanding 0:outstan 0:ding performances gee i came over

 0:partici 0:pated in the second part of fallex 86 the exercise as usual was a series of three training exercises 
 culminating in a five day divisional exercise with 4 panzer grenadier division 0:divi 0:sion with most of the brigade still 
 in bed recouperating from oktoberfest activities 2ppcli deployed to the bavarian countryside a week earlier than other units in a 
 joint exercise with the royal canadian dragoons the battalion spent four action packed days fighting the elusive and cunning b 
 company 0:com 0:pany c squadron enemy force advancing attacking digging 0:digg 0:ing running and even swimming were practiced during this 
 work up exercise the exercise culminated with an assault river crossing on an incredibly foggy friday morning several commanders at 
 the company and platoon level demonstrated innovative encircling tactics in mid stream which ended up with an assault on the 
 friendly bank how often all our million dollar high tech hardware depends on mr silva the brigade exercise saw similar 
 activity but on a much larger scale our engineer counterparts relearned the important 0:impor 0:tant requirement for rope when bridging 
 obstacles and as a result niner was ready to demonstrate other more lethal uses of rope in an effort to 
 maintain excellent relations with our german friends we tried our best not to dig up too many telephone lines power 
 cables or water mains we only backed 0:back 0:ed over one fire hydrant and in case you were wondering the 
 water does not shoot up in the air as in the movies just ask the boys in 22c fallex ended 
 with a seven hour rail move to a new exercise area as the first phase of a five day divisional 
 exercise 0:exer 0:cise with 4 panzer grenadier division the exercise started on a weekend and as we had nothing better 
 to do we dug in the first contact report came in late sunday afternoon however what was initially thought to 
 be enemy troops moving 0:mov 0:ing to an assembly area was in fact administration company going on a shower run 
 after fighting leopard ii tanks and marders for several days endex was called trenches were filled and we moved back 
 to the railhead to prepare for the move back to baden the exercise was a good experience for all but

 30 sports by lieutenant g macintosh during the past year the second battalion has again demonstrated why it is one 
 of the two sports super powers in cfe the battalion s representative teams continue to dominate their leagues and the 
 intense inter company competitions 0:com 0:petitions attest to the skills and determination of all the second s 0:se 0:cond 0:s 
 athletes the rebels the unit hockey team once again proved who was the cream of the crop in the cfe 
 hockey league the rebels after a long hard fought season maintained their first place standing at the conclusion of regular 
 season play during the play offs the rebels had some trouble with their opponents from the rcd but emerged victorious 
 and advanced 0:advanc 0:ed into the finals against our arch enemies from the r22er once again victory was ours and 
 the rebels defeated the citadelles by easily winning three of four games to become the cfehl champions for the second 
 year in a row the battalion has also continued to demonstrate considerable 0:con 0:siderable prowess on the soccer field the 
 battalion forms the core of the base team the kanadische kickers who have again come out on top in cfe 
 unfortunately the kickers easily odds on favourites to retain their cf title were denied the chance to defend their title 
 due to a mix up in flight bookings 0:book 0:ings to canada no doubt next year will see the kickers 
 reclaim the title that should have been theirs in 1986 in nonleague 0:non 0:league play the kickers played teams from 
 the local german league thereby getting valuable exposure to some very good soccer it is indicative of the kickers ability 
 that they came away with an even record of wins and losses well done the annual 4cmbg sports meet saw 
 a particularly strong showing on the part of the battalion first place wins were captured in the forced march and 
 the military skills competitions we also dominated the track events with the likes of private tompkins and master corporal farrow 
 providing 0:pro 0:viding some spectacular and very popular wins at the expense 0:ex 0:pense of the r22er incredibly the commander 
 s pennant still eluded us now onto more serious matters rugby the baden bayonets continue their aggressive play both on 
 and off the field indeed some would say too aggressive a well deserved 0:deserv 0:ed berlin rugby tour beerfest was 
 financed in part by a wildly 0:wild 0:ly successful bayonets bash by the end of the season the bayonets were 
 in possession of second place overall in their league not to sit content with that the bayonets defeated the league 
 champions from baumholder at the wursburg tournament 0:tourna 0:ment during a lull in fallex 86 the unit intercompany sports concluded 
 with the annual french grey cup game in what was unquestionably the best football game of the season the french 
 grey cup finished with combat support company s team 1 triumphant win over a company 12 6 b company walked 
 away with the prize for best float and their queen was judged to be the most beautiful following the contest 
 on the gridiron the unit gathered for an all ranks smoker for the presentation of awards and of course the 
 french grey cup next year will be our last full season of competition before leaving germany and plans are now 
 underway to make it our best year yet our main goal is to win the commander s 0:com 0:mander 0:s 
 pennant during the annual 4cmbg sports day all in all the unit has had a very good year and congratulations

 series of the 19505 they could just as easily have been used as a lights out message for all ranks 
 of third battalion during 1986 it was indeed an eventful year 1986 was a year with many faces it was 
 one of rebuilding filling the holes left by those who departed in 1985 to reinforce the second battalion for many 
 it was a year of travel some visited germany as umpires on fallex others toured australia and new zealand courtesy 
 of the canadian navy and of course we all went to wainwright new friends were made the small arms team 
 swapped yarns with shooters from throughout the commonwealth at bisley b coy became part of the british army at suffield 
 and on three occasions members of the unit trained in the usa the year was punctuated by various highlights expo 
 86 brought a greater than normal number of visitors to canada s west coast and third battalion provided guards of 
 honour for such noted dignitaries as their royal highnesses the prince and princess of wales and her royal highness princess 
 margaret one particularly significant visitor to expo was our own colonel in chief the countess mountbatten of burma throughout all 
 of this training continued at a pace just short of feverish ranging from mountain climbing and canoeing 0:canoe 0:ing to 
 the more traditional military skills we still found time however to appreciate the climate and location of work point barracks 
 all in all 1986 was an excellent year for canada s champagne battalion third battalion exercise spring run by captain

 at the first crack of enemy sa fire moving quickly to observe over the brim the enemy machine gun was 
 easily spotted through the tangled mesh of barb wire and the debris of bombardment the familiar bark of the platoon

 forward to positions 0:posi 0:tions of fire and the c 2 gunners had already laid into the objective 0:ob 0:jective 
 it had to be taken and quickly oc b coy maj jj lapeyre wanted to move the company forward to

 be proved a hard fight but a successful one the end product was the position secured three enemy paratroopers dead 
 but sadly a new reinforcement 0:reinforce 0:ment took one at the assault line while attempting to get through the wire 
 a practical exercise to bring the light of battle into the eyes of the soldiery of the third battalion was 
 well underway code named ex spring run 86 a battalion level exercise 0:exer 0:cise to practice and review soldiering at 
 the individual and section level based on company groups each company was given a week to train at fort lewis 
 washington and thanks are extended to our hosts the formulations of 1 corps and 9 id infantry division particularly mention 
 must be given to that fine unit the 2 23 infantry battalion the tomahawks the troops in preparation for the 
 section live fire assault course and for the heavier training for war at waincon 86 rehearsed themselves in their weapons 
 of intimate warfare individuals threw their grenades fired the support weapons the gpmg 50 cal hmg sraaw l and sraaw 
 h and practiced the ranging of the 60mm hand held mortar thrown in for good measure was day and night 
 operations ranging from section advance and assault to night patrolling the practice paid off when 24 sections of ground assault 
 infantry successfully attacked and destroyed a prepared enemy dugout using their available fire support individual initiative and superior will the 
 section assault was a delightful change from the training where blanks were issued the bayonets from a b and c 
 companies who some say were the finest fighting troops in the world attacked their mission with hard work and mental 
 fortitude 
 34 the us army provided realistic fire from their howitzers adding to the battle and our very own pioneer platoon 
 under the watchful eye of wo ron caven assisted by the likes of sgt bill johnson mcpl mike burke mcpl 
 greg melnechuk cpl paul bedard cpl ray albright and a host of other bearded blurry eyed pioneers set the stage 
 for combat the enemy was located in depth making their brothers at arms fight for every inch of terrain to 
 ensure the enemy had not forgotten the weary soldiers a simulated barrage fired into the face of the friendlies accompanied 
 by lines of troops counterattacking 0:counter 0:attacking through smoke set the final stage of the exercise all who fought their 
 way through the course were more than satisfied by the realism and the opportunity to test their ability they had 
 in fact been tested and each one individually 0:individual 0:ly succeeded in battle that day r and r after a 
 hard fought fight is always more than welcome and the boys from the third battalion welcomed the opportunity to try 
 the facilities offered by tacoma washington each company received one night on the town the old soldiers for the most 
 part took to the watering holes provided on fort as might be expected the young soldiers in their eagerness and 
 desire for adventure paraded themselves to all the available digs in town transport to and from was an experience in 
 patience in itself but the resident expert regarding the whens and wheres of transport sgt peter okopski 0:okop 0:ski ensured 
 all returned safe and eventually sound exercise spring run was a successful and fulfilling exercise for the soldiery of 3 
 ppcli it stood them in good stead for their future operations on waincon 86 and to those us army personnel

 it the other way around who can remember these trivial points another high point was a visit from the us

 well received by all the soldiers who attended waincon 86 gentlemen orders padre bisson padre blizzard will you please outline 
 the big picture one of the joys of wainwright at least to the third battalion 0:bat 0:talion is that it 
 usually offers us the opportunity to conduct some badly needed winter warfare training waincon 86 was no exception the second 
 unit exercise commenced in a blinding snow storm following a full night of snow and freezing 0:freez 0:ing temperatures the 
 battalion made it to the start line and was ready to roll when the roads were declared red and activity

 by wo r m turple shooting as always got off to an early start in february 86 with the small 
 arms team tryouts that were conducted for the first two weeks of the month after the team selections were made 
 training began in earnest the first phase of training was to educate the new shooters in all aspects of shooting

 the british columbia legislative grounds for prince charles and princess diana no sooner had the royal personages left the dais 
 than the band was whisked off to alberta for waincon 86 a highlight 0:high 0:light of that concentration was the

 corps of drums church parade in the field during waincon 86 as usual the coming of summer heralds the beginning 
 of the intensive band performance season and this year was no exception a scant two weeks after shaking the dust

 support of the royal australian navy s 75th anniversary while the rest of the band was involved in the fall 
 pcf cycle sixteen members flew to australia in early october to join three canadian destroyers as they sailed home although 
 the band members thoroughly enjoyed the trip it was not a pleasure cruise not only did they have a formidable 
 0:for 0:midable schedule of band commitments to contend with but they conducted small arms training for naval personnel and in

 50 extra regimentally employed ere patricias captain c c smith sky hawks demo city of edmonton annual christmas tree burn 
 laurier park january 1987 since our last contribution to the patrician the canadian 0:cana 0:dian airborne centre has once again 
 completed an extremely 0:extreme 0:ly hectic and varied year of training trials and demonstrations 0:demonstra 0:tions the airborne trials and 
 evaluation section under the capable leadership of captain w f 801 l and subsequently major r honig has been involved 
 in varied activities such as stand off parachuting with the new mtix ram air canopy and in one instance a 
 team actually flew some 22 km to the target area other interesting trials conducted were the lapes drop of the 
 lynx much to the horror of the black hats i wonder if anybody will volunteer to ride inside parachute trials 
 of the cf 18 ejection seat parachute and soon to unfold the by 206 trials which will involve both airdrop 
 lapes and sling load i wonder if we can avoid bending a by 206 the parachute training wing with major 
 g m whiting at the helm is as busy as ever the past season was further complicated by the imposition 
 of the mountain operations course which meant many of his instructors such as sergeant g crossman sergeant h smith and 
 sergeant a whitehall turned in their parachutes for mountain climbing gear for the bulk of the summer one sage aptly 
 quipped that variety is the spice of life this certainly was the case for ptw last season a busy time 
 for all this summer will further see ptw heavily involved with parachute training both static line and freefall mountaineering 0:mountaineer 
 0:ing and just as a bonus some personnel will be involved with the field firing course in suffield during ry 
 87 
 51 the aerial delivery training wing has also had a busy year as can be attested by sergeant f hayden 
 and sergeant l a gordon this wing of cabc will be or possibly will have by the time this article 
 is printed been deeply involved in ry 87 as the receiving rail movement unit in wainwright this affair 0:af 0:fair 
 of course will dictate a certain amount of cross training however who said cabc personnel weren t flexible the canadian 
 forces parachute team now under command 0:com 0:mand of captain p metaxas is heading for another busy season last year 
 saw 72 shows put on across canada and the united states logging some 55 000 air miles in travel on 
 an individual basis sergeant j murray participated in the canadian national parachute competition in gananoque ontario 0:on 0:tario and placed 
 sixth overall an exceptionally creditable performance this year our masters in ottawa have restricted the sky hawks cfpt to some 
 50 shows and at least there will be some breathing space for the team members i m sure they will 
 enjoy another exceptional season the following members of the ppcli serving at cabc send greetings to their comrades far and

 52 the ppcli battle school captain n a maclaine adjutant winter 86 as has become tradition the battle school started 
 off the new year with a full house having nine platoons of all types on the ground in january a 
 popular season to visit wainwright peak strength for the year was reached january 22 with 522 all ranks of the 
 parade state this figure would have been even larger had the winter warfare course not been cancelled 0:can 0:celled due 
 to lack of interest lack of aircraft and lack of winter in balmy wainwright at least in february the battle 
 school was visited by lieutenant general twomey of the us marine crops who wished to undergo winter indoctrination while enroute 
 to the arctic after leaving six inches of snow in quantico virginia he had his first taste of alberta winter 
 when stepping onto bare grass and above freezing temperatures he was well hosted by flers courcelette platoon 8542 who were 
 doing patrol training 0:train 0:ing at the time and showed him how the viet nam war could have been won 
 by patricia recruits march 17 was celebrated in the normal fashion with sports competitions for the platoons and the annual 
 broom i 100 0:broom 0:i 0:100 match the game was fought to a close finish but eventually 0:even 0:tually the 
 numerical superiority of ncos first second and third strings prevailed over the finesse of the officers line up were it 
 not for incremental staff the officers would have had to default altogether since the combat dentist and divisional mother dr 
 sandra lamb refused to play goalie spring 86 as the rest of the brigade geared up for waincon in late 
 march the pace at the battle school slowed comfortably allowing the school to conduct refresher training on such things as 
 first aid defensive driving cpr and platoon weapons after discouraging results on the pistol by the adjutant 0:adju 0:tant and 
 chief clerk a certain measure of success was achieved with a case of grenades fortunately the co and rsm were 
 still good enough on the old browning 9mm to resoundingly 0:re 0:soundingly beat all comers at the annual cock o 
 the walk competition the rsm s relay of the cock 0 the walk competition how can you tell it s 
 not the co s relay because their pistols are all pointing down range summer 86 defining the boundary between spring 
 and summer in wainwright is at best a judgement call since it can be reasonably argued that there are only 
 alternating days of summer and winter wildhay river after torrential rains doused the fire but before the hail and snow 
 wiped out the smiles sgt nemo mccully prepare to dive in june captain neil maclaine took the available staff on 
 a white water expedition in the foothills for a change of pace a change of pace it was since sleet 
 snow tornadoes hypothermia and class 111 rapids are rarely encountered in a normal day at the school participants with aching 
 shoulders blistered hands and cold soaked clothing grew weary of cheerful claims that a change is as good as a 
 rest however with the excellent assistance of wo big dave parker and a bag full of tranquilizers even sgt nemo 
 mccully managed to make the 230 kms and 2000 vertical feet without human loss there was in fact a grim 
 pleasure in watching record flood levels carry trees and drowned animals down the athabasca knowing that a similar airforce expedition 
 had required 0:re 0:quired rescue a few days earlier 
 53 posting season resulted in a significant turn over of staff including the co lcol dave montgomery the chief instructor 
 0:instruc 0:tor captain bob halpin the last of the red hot cls and rsm scotty hamilton lcol ron bragdon officially 
 took command on the fourth of july and rsm lloyd was promoted into his current position in august with the 
 arrival of new masters a significant reorganization of the school was implemented leadership recruit and training support companies were formed 
 to improve command and control and the position of chief instructor vanished in favour of dco with major marcel beztilny 
 first of the red hot dcos moving into the slot fall 86 block leave in august a welcome respite was 
 followed by the fall build up of courses including two unexpected but welcome direct entry platoons there were tq3 ytep

 aide is always walking off with mine lcol bragdon presents rsm bruce lloyd with his omm certificate simultaneously just to

 which could always be put off until after 29 november every day before dawn the woods around wainwright 0:wain 0:wright 
 were crowded with various o groups and recce groups out looking for things to shoot but as all good things 
 must come to an end so did hunting season and the great memories and embarrassing misses could only be re 
 lived ad nauseum in the coffee room to be converted into a trophy room after a hectic but typical year 
 all life at the school ground to a halt with the conclusion of the men s christmas dinner on 12

 54 the regimental band sergeant lan r f ferric canadian forces base calgary princess patricia s canadian light infantry band 
 alberta the past year was relatively quiet for the regimental band with the budget freeze in the early months and 
 no major 0:ma 0:jor exercise like ry 85 the biggest events up until june were the opening of expo 86 
 on may ist and the trooping of the colour by the first battalion in june for sheer excitement and public 
 exposure the opening of expo had to be the hands on winner all participants rehearsed together for two days then 
 we were front and centre 0:cen 0:tre in b c place before 60 000 spectators and tv cameras carrying the 
 ceremony across canada and around the world the enthusiastic roar of the crowd when from calgary alberta the princess patricia 
 s canadian light infantry band came across the public address system was almost deafening 0:deafen 0:ing without a doubt every 
 member of the band stood a bit taller and played a bit louder from that point on if expo 86 
 was the highlight of our public performances the trooping had to be on a par militarily we joined the first 
 battalion for the last two weeks of rehearsals leading up to the june 27 event there was a daily improvement 
 on all fronts and the end result received a lot of praise the training in the hot sun was definitely 
 not wasted the day before the trooping at the dress rehearsal the band was presented with a new set of 
 regimental parade drums decorated with the regimental colours and battle honours these were presented by alberta energy company the ppcli 
 band on parade at cfb calgary during the trooping the colour of the first battalion on june 27 1986 in 
 tribute to a former colonel of the regiment major general retd g g brown the budget freeze caused us to 
 postpone two concert tours in the fall in october we spent a week in the edmonton hinton area performing concerts 
 in schools and for the public in early december we had a similar tour in cranbrook b c these tours 
 helped publicize the ppcli as well as the canadian armed forces in areas where they don t normally have a 
 high profile we had one major personnel change this year when chief warrant officer bob fowler came to the band 
 from the central band in ottawa he assumed the position of assistant director of music following the posting of chief 
 warrant officer 0:of 0:ficer jack kopstein to the vimy band in kingston chief warrant 0:war 0:rant officer fowler began his 
 career as a sapper with the royal canadian engineers in chilliwack in 1956 after seven years he remustered to the 
 rce band as a percussionist he was posted to the central band from 1968 until his posting to calgary his 
 professional attitude has already been a great asset to the band this year and next will see the band participating 
 in major 0:ma 0:jor ceremonial events with all battalions this is intended to prepare all those involved for a mass 
 trooping in 1989 the 75th anniversary of the regiment by that time the band should be completely fitted with new

 canoe trip down the battle river in september did go as planned however the rain did put a damper on 
 the trip this was followed by a shooting and rappelling weekend in conjunction with the vermilion army cadets this proved 
 to be a good weekend at camp wainwright in october with instructors coming from both cadet corps affiliated units november

 which was a pleasant way to start to an area near hamburg where we trained with a german armoured infantry 
 0:in 0:fantry regiment for nearly a week the riflemen and the bundeswehr soldiers got on pretty well swapped stories equipment 
 and much beer we had a fair number of visits to and from the battalion and highlighted with two soccer 
 matches 0:mat 0:ches one between the officers and senior noncommissioned 0:non 0:commissioned officers of 1 rgj against our opposite german 
 0:ger 0:man numbers and the other a full battalion side against the german battalion not surprisingly 1 rgj by a 
 combination 0:combina 0:tion of greater skill and physical presence won the battalion 0:bat 0:talion match most surprisingly the officers and 
 sncos beat the germans who played in a local league no one was more surprised than 1 rgj having completed 
 a very enjoyable week s training and international relations we moved north and completed a very wet and quite exhausting 
 exercise we learned much about the tactics of the german and the danes forward take no prisoners all was well 
 and after five days we packed up and returned to tidworth overall it was both instructive and fun a combination 
 that should make any project worthwhile 0:worth 0:while meanwhile because of our tour in northern ireland and ex bold guard 
 our impending move to osnabruck required 0:re 0:quired a great deal of concentrated hard work all the drivers for the 
 armoured personnel carriers and the other tracked vehicles and their various instructors had to be trained a very busy period 
 of training was completed by early december and then the rather less interesting tasks of clean ing up the barrack 
 in tidworth ready for our handover to the ist battalion the queen s regiment took place this was completed in 
 mid january and at the time of writing only the quartermaster major david conway is still in uk the rest 
 of the battalion are grappling with all that is new in germany we managed to fit a fair amount of 
 extra mural activities into our busy last few months in uk a successful and very enjoyable skill at arms meeting 
 was held and an expedition to the highlands of scotland in november december proved that even at that time of 
 year enjoyment can be extracted from training plenty of sport was played and it is clear that in soccer rugby 
 and hockey we have some very useful players itching to get going in germany unfortunately the weather and training constraints 
 prevented the battalion from entering many of the competitions however our representation at army 0:ar 0:my level hockey captains nick

 of bomb making and associated equipments nevertheless the riflemen had to maintain a high level of patrolling and alertness to 
 deter the terrorist who is always looking for a soft target we believe the measure of our success was the 
 lack of incidents in the northern ireland awards announced just before christmas the battalion was rewarded with a mention in 
 despatches for the commanding officer and major simon stanford tuck and goc s commendations for wo2 g a ball sgt 
 p a ashby sgt p j clements and rfn swords 
 72 the battalion returned to minden the first week of march and proceeded on a well deserved three week leave 
 on conclusion 0:con 0:clusion of post northern ireland leave the battalion embarked 0:embark 0:ed upon a comprehensive sequence of internal 
 jncos mortar 0:mor 0:tar milan land rover hgv apc cvr t and signals courses which lasted to the end of 
 may at times the rsm only 0:on 0:ly had a handful of men to cover the multitude of battalion and 
 garrison duties which the heightened security situation as a result of libyan bombings brought about in mid july the whole 
 battalion went to the ranges at sennelager for our annual small arms camp whilst there we also took the opportunity 
 to do all our annual mandatory tests including the new infantry combat fitness test which requires you to cover three 
 miles in 33 minutes with 35 pounds of webbing helmet and personal weapon it was not an easy test and 
 to claim a 100 per cent pass rate would not be honest but a 92 per cent pass rate is 
 a creditable performance 0:perfor 0:mance on return from sennelager the final phase of the battalion s 0:bat 0:talion 0:s baor 
 tour started namely endless checks inspections 0:inspec 0:tions and all those things one associates with handovers by way of farewell 
 to minden both messes gave a reception followed by an impressive sounding of retreat as the battalion packed its possessions 
 and grappled with the problem of how to get six years worth of new acquisitions 0:ac 0:quisitions into a somewhat 
 small baggage allowance we had occasion to reflect on our tour in germany since arrival in minden in november 1980 
 we have had three changes of commanding officer no less than six seconds in command five adjutants four rsms as 
 well as numerous changes of company commanders and officer appointments 0:ap 0:pointments very nearly two thirds of the battalion has 
 only seen service in a baor role roughly half of the battalion s time was spent away from minden on 
 operations in northern ireland training its mechanised role or exercising on the north german plain or in canada or guarding 
 some vital installation 0:in 0:stallation or indeed ourselves a total time out of barracks of just over three years the 
 apcs we drove for some 382 500 miles were all on average four to six years older than the men 
 who drove or travelled in them we were told we used some 2 97 million litres of fuel for our 
 vehicles our land rovers covered nearly 900 000 miles whilst our four tonners drove 1 2 million miles in total 
 our vehicle fleet covered 3 1 million miles we used about 5 1 million kwt of electricity and 4 78 
 million litres of oil to heat and light our buildings and garages we drank washed with swam in and generally 
 used 282 600 cubic meters of water we replaced 2 400 boots and fired just over 4 1 million rounds 
 of 7 62 mm ammunition we trained as individuals or as groups in france denmark italy kenya belize and canada 
 over 420 postings in and out of ncos and riflemen took place the cooks tell us we ate some 429 
 tons of potatoes as well as 86 tons of chips enough sausages to stretch 564 miles and over 1 25 
 million eggs sadly three of our number were killed on operations in northern ireland and one died of natural causes 
 whilst out running we mourn their passing some 358 babies were born to wives of members of the battalion which 
 included three sets of twins we opened for business as the demonstration battalion to the school of infantry in warminster 
 on 2 september within 0:with 0:in a week and a half over 80 per cent of the battalion was deployed 
 onto salisbury plain as part of the final exercise of a ta officers course the week prior to this the 
 companies apart from meeting the everyday needs for sections and individuals 0:in 0:dividuals for small demonstrations at the school were 
 busy preparing themselves for this their first non mechanised exercise 0:exer 0:cise for over six years one unexpected facet of 
 life as the demonstration battalion is the many roles we have to play in one week a company can be 
 asked to act in an air mobile role on light scales change to a mechanised role in mid week and 
 pretend 0:pre 0:tend to be elements of a russian motor rifle regiment at the end of the week if that 
 is not confusing enough in itself then try being a company 1 warminster rifles in the exerise scenario when in 
 real life you are d company 2 rgj and your next role is as a member of the orange or 
 fantasian forces the riflemen as usual take all this in their stride but not without the usual unprintable comments in 
 addition to the various school of infantry exercises and demonstrations we are frequently involved in trialling and testing new bits 
 of equipment for the infantry trials and development unit itdu and making training military sales films the way riflemen and 
 some of the officers can change from guinea pig to actor at a moment s notice is quite remarkable one 
 of our major trial subjects in the coming year will be the new infantry combat vehicle warrior for which we 
 have already trained a number of drivers gunners signallers and commanders to participate in forthcoming trials we are due to 
 get some 15 of these vehicles towards the middle of 1987 when we will be expected to man them on 
 all the mechanised exercises of the school of infantry this promises to be an exciting prospect as we will be 
 intimately involved in developing and hopefully influencing the tactical use of this vehicle the other major piece of equipment we 
 are involved with is the trialling of law 80 the new british shoulder fired antitank 0:anti 0:tank weapon for which 
 our previous 21 c tom hamilton baillie is the mod project officer for our day to day tasks we have 
 72 apcs and 18 cvr t in which we had already covered some 22 500 miles by the end of 
 december 1986 the two years of relative stability of the warminster posting will hopefully enable us to further the sporting 
 talents of our riflemen which hitherto has been difficult to do in germany 0:ger 0:many due to the endless exercise 
 commitments we have already participated in the cambrian patrol competition in wales this was led by lt tim murray threipland 
 and took place in mid october we achieved a creditable fifth position capt james magan with lt edward butler and 
 the battalion 0:bat 0:talion cross country team have so far quite unexpectedly had a very good season by winning the 
 swinderby marathon for the army and are currently lying third in the district cross country league the soccer team under 
 capt qm danny hunt is heavily involved with a and b teams in various local and army leagues and at 
 the time of writing is in the semifinals 0:semi 0:finals of the army cup the hockey team under the watchful 
 eye of capt tom byrne has so far had a most successful season with two of their number being selected 
 to play for the infantry in boxing rfn lesbirel and rfn ruddock are in the running for the army boxing 
 squad a posting in the uk certainly offers excellent opportunities 0:oppor 0:tunities for overseas military and adventurous training within three 
 weeks of arrival we had already sent a composite platoon s 0:pla 0:toon 0:s worth of soldiers to cyprus attached 
 to 7 rha the sailing officer major nick chavasse who fortunately also runs the sailing for the infantry organised a 
 very rough autumnal sailing trip for some 30 riflemen to the channel isles the adventurous training officer lt peter balls 
 has already organised a week s skiing for over 100 members of the battalion at most competitive rates in france 
 an expedition 0:expedi 0:tion to greenland is also being planned for mid 1987 on arrival in warminster we were joined 
 by the normandy 0:norman 0:dy band of the royal green jackets although they have a very busy programme we nevertheless 
 do see and hear them 
 73 marching around camp on their rehearsals what a pleasure it is to have a band in our midst again 
 our first demonstration enacted by d company took place on 8 and 9 october and in spite of the tannoy 
 system causing the odd case of heart failure to the compere major jeremy russell oc d company it went off 
 extremely well on this first demonstration we even had a royal visitor his royal highness the duke of york rn 
 who as we were all told tongue in cheek by our compere was there to refresh his memory on what 
 the army does we also managed for the very first time on a firepower demonstration to fire the new sa 
 80 rifle and light support weapon in spite of our official issue not arriving until three weeks later it proved 
 to be very impressive and we are looking 0:look 0:ing forward to re equipping completely with this weapon in 1987 
 the return to the uk has enabled families and the bachelors to have a much more active social life which 
 the exercise commitments and language barrier in germany largely prevented many have visited local real estate agents and some have 
 already bought houses locally the minds of some of the bachelor officers have turned to the subject of matrimony and 
 one has already fallen within two weeks of arrival in the battalion this is not an encouraging trend for a 
 mess which traditionally has a large bachelor population but judging by the look in the eyes of some of the 
 livers in and the increased number of speed violations on the warminster to london road matrimonial fever may yet afflict 
 a few more shortly after arrival in warminster the adjutant s office finally broke with tradition and for the first 
 time in the history of the royal green jackets employed a female assistant adjutant 0:ad 0:jutant gillian wright joined us 
 direct from sandhurst and almost immediately went on a free fall parachute course with the regimental parachute display team the 
 battalion s friday runs are now almost 100 per cent fully supported as everyone can t wait to see gillian 
 in her tracksuit gillian has adapted remarkably quickly although we are a little worried about the staff duties they taught 
 her at sandhurst because no one has yet dared to tell her that mrs schnif is not the wife of 
 a rifleman although 1986 was the 20th anniverary of the creation of the royal green jackets it was an event 
 which appears to have gone largely unrecorded it may therefore be of interest 0:in 0:terest to record a few statistics 
 about 2 rgj in the last 20 years since 1966 the battalion has had three colonels commandant 0:com 0:mandant one 
 of whom rose to be a field marshal no less than eleven commanding officers four of whom have reach ed 
 two star rank or above and one who rose to the rank of field marshal of the twenty two seconds 
 in command three are currently two star or above and three came back to command 0:com 0:mand the battalion whilst 
 two went on to command 1 rgj two to command 4 rgj and one to command 5 rgj four went 
 on to command the depot so far one of the thirteen former adjutants commands an armoured brigade in germany 0:ger 
 0:many after having commanded 3 rgj whilst another one is our present commanding officer and his successor as adjutant 0:adju 
 0:tant commands 5 rgj we have also had five quartermasters 0:quarter 0:masters twelve rsms and three bugle majors in the 
 last 20 years our homes have been eleven different barracks in penang munster ballykelly catterick gibralter 2 tidworth minden 2 
 and warminster 2 since 1966 we have spent 13 years and four months outside the uk penang one year six 
 months munster three years seven months belize six months 0:mon 0:ths gibralter two years minden five years nine months a 
 total of four years nine months since 1966 have been spent on operations in borneo belize and northern ireland sadly 
 in twenty years the battalion has lost eleven of its members as a result of active service which includes a 
 company commander 0:com 0:mander and commanding officer to mark the 20th anniversary appropriately and to bid a belated farewell into 
 retirement to the very first commanding officer of 2 rgj we dined out field marshal lord bramall on 31 october 
 1986 to whom we as a battalion regiment and army owe so much for this we succeeded in assembling all 
 surviving ex commanding officers of 2 rgj all bar two of those still alive who had commanded battalions of the 
 krrc prior to the field marshal a total of 52 of us sat down to dinner 0:din 0:ner after a 
 find sounding of retreat in miserable weather at the end of the year we also said goodbye to general sir 
 frank kitson on relinquishing the post of colonel commandant 0:comman 0:dant of the battalion over seven years of behind the 
 scenes work on our behalf we welcome major general david ramsbotham as our new colonel commandant with effect from ist 
 january we look forward to an interesting and rewarding time here in warminster in spite of the fact that we 
 will be continually 0:con 0:tinually in the public eye most of our work will be exciting and interesting some of 
 it boring and repetitive but necessary in spite of all this we would hope that members of the allied regiment 
 who find themselves in the warminster area will have time to drop in on us at battlebury barracks where they 
 can be assured of a very warm welcome even if we are rushing from one demonstration or exercise to another 
 who knows we may rope you in on the act 3 royal green jackets commanding officer lieutenant colonel a r 
 d pringle mbe the 3rd battalion is approaching the end of the fifth and final year of its tour in 
 celle west germany as part of the british army of the rhine baor it has been a busy year as 
 always with a hectic but progressive training cycle of which the highlight was our trip to the british army training 
 unit suffield 0:suf 0:field batus in alberta in western canada in the summer the beginning of the year found us 
 on a corps deployment 0:deploy 0:ment exercise in extremely cold weather we spent several days in snow covered woods with 
 the temperature firmly stuck below the minus 20 celsius mark in the spring we made repeated trips to the nato 
 training centre at sen nelager to classify on our personal weapons for field firing and for the divisional skill at 
 arms meeting field firing was serious business and formed a vital link in our work up training 0:train 0:ing for 
 batus all the companies worked very hard and much was achieved this fortnight culminated in a live firing test exercise 
 for each company three 105 mm abbot guns from the chestnut troop 1 rha joined us for the exercise to 
 provide 0:pro 0:vide some heavy fire support which they did to such good effect 0:ef 0:fect that the commanding officer 
 watching proceedings from a vantage point declared himself thoroughly neutralised 0:neutralis 0:ed the highlight of our several trips to sennelager 
 was the divisional skill at arms meeting we had been chosen to 
 74 organise it this year which major jeremy knight oc hq coy did most efficiently the bisley team under the 
 captaincy of captain roy stanger took advantage of the absence of the welsh guards in northern ireland to sweep the 
 board the climax of the meeting was provided by the falling plate team led by sgt wilkinson beating 1 staffords 
 in the final with a thrilling display of marksmanship roared on by several hundred 0:hun 0:dred riflemen among the spectators 
 rfn aimable won the prize as champion at arms later in the day he also won the army rifle association 
 revolver cup which started in 1924 and has only been won by two riflemen before in 1936 by rfn gurr 
 of 1 rb and in 1963 by lieutenant mead of 2 green jackets the battalion spent the usual two weeks 
 at soltau in june which provided the first opportunity for the whole battle group bg to train together before going 
 to batus the bg consisted of the battalion less a coy but plus c and d sqns 1 rtr the 
 chestnut troop 1 rha and some engineers the weather was kind to us with it raining just often enough to 
 keep the dust down but not enough to turn it into a mudbath many lessons were learned oc 7 pi 
 lt alastair maxwell was captured with the rest of his fighting patrol by a coy who were enemy for the 
 exercise by making good use of their night vision devices a line laying patrol returned to bg hq to report 
 that they had detected an enemy patrol tapping into our lines a motley fighting force of signallers and drivers was 
 quickly assembled under the leadership of the arso wo2 strick and in a gallant action they overran the enemy position 
 0:posi 0:tion only to find that the enemy was a section of our own field engineers such is the fog 
 of war a lucky escape occurred when our gazelle helicopter pilot flew so low that he became entangled in some 
 wire hung between two trees and crashed fortunately neither man nor machine was seriously hurt by the end of bg 
 training we were confident and raring to go looking forward to doing it live at batus we deployed to canada 
 in vc 10s via keflavik in iceland in late july on arrival at suffield there was little time before deploying 
 onto the prairie except to attend a compulsory briefing by the head of the local rcmp detachment advice was given 
 in an unexpectedly amusing manner on all the dos and don ts of life on the prairie ranging from what 
 to do if bitten by a rattlesnake to what not to do in the sin bin in medicine hat and 
 ending with a polite warning that presents from the departing bg to the rcmp detachment of bunches of bananas would 
 not be kindly received this enlightened approach completely won over his audience and our stay at batus was completely trouble 
 free there followed 0:follow 0:ed an intensive period of progressive field training working up to a final five day exercise 
 set at bg level practising every aspect of modern warfare quick attacks were mounted hasty 0:has 0:ty defences conducted rivers 
 crossed and minefields breached 0:breach 0:ed as the size and scope of the field firing exercises increased 0:increas 0:ed so 
 the confidence at all levels of command grew by the end of the exercise it was plain to all in 
 the bg and on the safety staff that there was nothing which would throw the bg off its stride as 
 usual the riflemen stole the show their ability to keep going under the most arduous conditions was remarked 0:remark 0:ed 
 upon repeatedly by the safety staff at the end of the exercise 0:exer 0:cise our brigade commander who had come 
 over from baor to observe our performance paid public tribute to the riflemen at the end of the exercise all 
 members of the bg enjoyed 0:en 0:joyed a few days r and r and some fifty were able to stay 
 behind for two weeks adventurous training in the rocky mountains many members of the bg went camping along the bow 
 river or based themselves on 1 ppcli in calgary many others went to vancouver to visit expo 86 the adventurous 
 training party cycled rode trekked canoed and skied in the jasper national park after four weeks leave the battalion reformed 
 in baor towards the end of september ex eternal triangle the 1 armd div field training exercise ftx was only 
 three weeks away it was to be the battalion s final ftx in baor and we were determined to enjoy 
 it and after five years in the mechanised role show off our paces however the weather and the exercise planners 
 conspired against us it poured with rain for several days which made severe restrictions on our freedom of manouevre necessary 
 in order to keep exercise 0:exer 0:cise damage within reasonable limits we criss crossed the german countryside mostly on roads 
 and mostly out of contact 0:con 0:tact with the enemy for a fortnight before as a grand finale conducting a 
 major assault river crossing by night of the river weser the crossing was a success but the riflemen were disappointed 
 to find that once again the enemy positions were undefended this year has seen the battalion enjoy some success in 
 the sports field we won the baor infantry cricket and tennis competitions earlier in the year lieutenant simon hudson and 
 sergeant brown led the nordic ski team to second place in the infantry championships fifth in the divisional and twentieth 
 0:twen 0:tieth in the army an outstanding achievement for a novice team in the judo we were runners up in 
 the divisional novices championship and have qualified for the baor finals this was a tremendous achievement by wo2 maher who 
 formed the battalion judo club only a few months ago in athletics we squeezed through to the baor finals where 
 we came fifth our best result since 1975 most of the credit for this was due to lcpl williams a 
 brilliant all round athlete and rfn harwood who came fifth in the javelin in the army individual 0:in 0:dividual finals 
 in novices boxing we are through to the divisional 0:divi 0:sional finals having beaten 1 r irish in a close 
 match in the semi final the team is now being coached by wo2 cheatham 0:cheat 0:ham on loan from 5 
 rgj a retired army champion and cpl miles the just retured combined services heavyweight champion who has been posted to 
 us from 1 rgj our boxing star of course is lcpl velinor the army combined services and aba welterweight champion 
 he is now training with the national team for the 1988 olympics and was unlucky not to box for england 
 at edinburgh in the commonwealth games last but by no means least captain micky gleeson won the 1 armd div 
 veterans squash championships the year closed with a very successful battalion review held in our recently decorated theatre the highlights 
 included 0:includ 0:ed b coy s troupe of break dancers who decided that audience 0:au 0:dience participation was the name 
 of the game and dragged several unsuspecting officers onto the stage including the commanding officer who to everyone s huge 
 amusement returned a virtuoso performance the officers mess skit loosely modelled on the tv series alio alio won popular acclaim 
 largely for the revealing performance of major jamie balfour s nanny as yvette in 1987 we look forward to returning 
 to colchester as part of 19 infantry brigade at the end of march a coy goes to jamaica for a 
 month in june the battalion is earmarked for an unaccompanied tour in the falkland islands in the winter but it 
 remains to be seen if in fact the whole battalion will have to go already we know that after only 
 two years in colchester 0:col 0:chester the battalion goes to gibralter in march 1989 also for two years 
 75 4 royal green jackets commanding officer lieutenant colonel n johnson 1986 was the last year of training for the 
 currently organised battalion after camp in october the battalion was split to form 4 and 5 rgj 4 rgj will 
 encompass all the london 0:lon 0:don companies and 5 rgj will be formed from the oxford aylesbury and bletchley locations 
 january brought our first sporting success of 1986 with a company winning the south east district cross country championships held 
 at pirbright despite not winning the ta skiing championships at aviemore in scotland the team and all its supporters had 
 a relaxing and enjoyable week in the highlands on sunday 16 march the battalion exercised their freedom of the city 
 of westminster by marching through the city and past buckingham palace led by the buglers of the light division depot 
 shrewsbury and the normandy band of the royal green jackets before the march past the guard of honour was inspected 
 by the lord mayor of westminster councillor roger bramble the battalion is the first and only unit of her majesty 
 s forces to have been granted the freedom of the city and it was granted in the city s four 
 hundredth 0:hun 0:dredth anniversary year on 5 december 1985 our military skills were next put to the test during the 
 courage trophy competition an inter unit section competition 0:competi 0:tion in late march the b company team produced a spirited 
 effort and only just got pipped into runners up position june then saw the re invention of the wheel and 
 once again the team was headed for baor to take part in ex hurst park on our return the well 
 oiled and now experienced 0:ex 0:perienced tac hq had the opportunity to command real troops the exercise involved half the 
 battalion under the commanding officer defending imber with the other half as the attack force under the second in command 
 the period ended on a sporting and social high with the battalion being represented by two teams in the light 
 division regatta at seaviews isle of wight the b team had unprecedented 0:un 0:precedented success winning all of the races 
 on both days our final event in june was to host both the rb and krrc reunions where young and 
 old gathered to relive former battles and experiences during rgj week in july the 4th battalion provided a small display 
 team who performed each evening as part of the sounding retreat the demonstration of abseiling from scout helicopters coupled with 
 the air landing of the remainder 0:re 0:mainder by lynx was professionally executed and brought an enthusiastic response from the 
 spectators on each evening also in july our shooting team was in the final preparation 0:prepara 0:tion stages for ta 
 bisley their final position did not match the previous years attempt although they managed third in the rifle match this 
 was followed in september by sending a battalion headquarters team to the brigade tactical trainer in sennelager 0:sen 0:nelager west 
 germany annual camp this year was in late october when we took part in the ist armoured division s exercise 
 exercise eternal triangle this was a two week field exercise for the most part under appalling weather conditions nevertheless 0:never 
 0:theless the battalion acquitted itself well and many valuable lessons were learned on return from camp we went immediately into 
 the run up to the remembrance weekend this is always a special time for the battalion since it brings together 
 members of the former regiments with the current battalion on 16 november we had our annual battalion livery dinner this 
 year it was held in the haberdashers hall and we were honoured to have lord whitelaw as the principal guest 
 and after dinner speaker on 1 december 5 rgj was born and a and d companies 0:com 0:panies moved to 
 form the nucleus of the new battalion as a result 4 rgj is now totally a london based battalion the 
 final event of 1986 was the handover of command this was a three sided event as lieutenant colonel peter lyddon 
 0:lyd 0:don handed over command to lieutenant colonel david innes 0:in 0:nes to command 5 rgj in oxford and to 
 major neil johnson to command 4 rgj in london he will be the first ta commanding 0:com 0:manding officer for 
 twelve years 5 royal green jackets commanding officer lieutenant colonel d j innes well here we are born on ist 
 december 1986 being only just over a month old at time of writing we do not have much of a 
 past to boast about except perhaps in those first few days of life just before christmas we did have some 
 very good parties first our origins we grew out of a and d companies of 4 rgj it must be 
 recorded that 4 rgj could not have been more helpful from the word go in ensuring that the change would 
 be smooth and without acrimony there has been nothing but co operation so far and there is no reason to 
 suspect that this relationship will not last now as to where we are battalion headquarters is at oxford along with 
 the riflemen who were a company of 4 rgj and who are now the manpower of headquarter and support company 
 this division is a false one within the real establishment but has been brought in at least provisionally to ease 
 some of the training burden d company at aylesbury is still d company but now of 5 rgj it has 
 shrunk though not through lack of spirit but by the hiving off the bletchley platoon formerly 16 platoon which is 
 now e company both these companies like to reflect their territorial connections to the regiment by prefixing 0:prefix 0:ing themselves 
 with letter for the future we will be forming a company at high wycombe and this is likely to start 
 from a base of riflemen who come from that area sooner rather than later a move which will leave d 
 company even thinner on the ground we are looking for a place to live in high wycombe both short and 
 long term and are hoping to start operating from there in october 1987 now to the human side the battalion 
 is commanded by lieutenant colonel david innes who now has a regular army team of some size with captain robert 
 bolton as adjutant major bill taylor as qm wol peter hopkins as rsm and ma 
 76 jor hugh babington smith no longer project officer but now training major still at oxford as spsi is wo2 
 jake cheetham with csgt jim purdue as qpsi these two having got used to dealing with the training of one 
 company are now looking after two although to be truthful the strength is as yet unchanged 0:un 0:changed wo2 owen 
 nilsson still chases d company round their training while csgt john tyson rules his stores with his london 0:lon 0:don 
 tongue and bisilisk eye at bletchley csgt glen ternent is doubling up as spsi and qpsi until a spsi is 
 found in addition to his regular staff the commanding officer has of course his non regular permanent staff nrps known 
 to all as nerps the battalion admin officer captain john beerman captains dickie brimmer and ginger cockcroft ex royal signals 
 at aylesbury and bletchley roms pat veasey wo2 b jones as mtmo are but a few of these worthy gentlemen 
 while from 4 rgj we have inherited among others ssgt tom ellis reme just awarded the bfm in the new 
 year s honours list on coming to ta members of the battalion although they are of course the most important 
 we have space only to mention the company commanders with the battalion second 0:se 0:cond in command major bryn howell 
 price commanding d company is major martin rigby recently retired from the 2nd battalion e company is major bill conroy 
 who transferred in from the queen s regiment major lan thomas is oc support company whlie captain richard long commands 
 headquarters 0:head 0:quarters company at the time of writing the battalion is shaking out and feeling its way the buckinghamshire 
 companies are in the process of their normal training concentrating very much on their ncos while at oxford the reorganisation 
 continues soldiers finding not only their new platoon or department but those platoons themselves finding where their patch is so 
 far touch wood one sees smiles everywhere and everyone is working to the common aim of making the battalion work 
 to this end there will be a proportion of weekends where the battalion is in one place and the riflemen 
 can see that they are part of an organisation larger than their platoon or company 0:com 0:pany the royal green 
 jackets light division depot winchester commanding officer lieutenant colonel m k om dewar since the last entry from the depot 
 there have been enormous changes both in staff and organization the much heralded move of the depot from peninsula barracks 
 to sir john moore barracks has now taken place and although one or two elements such as the green jackets 
 museum still remain 0:re 0:main in the centre of winchester the old barracks is now virtually 0:vir 0:tually empty and 
 awaiting a series of decisions as to its future sir john moore barracks on the outskirts of winchester is a 
 vast improvement on the old facilities sports pitches a lavish physical and recreational training centre ranges dry training areas excellent 
 accommodation classrooms and offices 0:of 0:fices all are present on the site and we are getting large numbers 0:num 0:bers 
 of high ranking visitors coming down to see us the commanding 0:com 0:manding officer has taken to carrying a tour 
 guide s umbrella so that he can be spotted in amongst the crowds of tourists the organization of the depot 
 has also changed there are now two adult training companies where one existed before 0:be 0:fore a large training wing 
 and education wing have also been formed to co ordinate and carry out specialist training and we have formed a 
 junior soldiers and junior leaders company when our sister depot in shrewsbury closed in august the past six months have 
 seen a period of consolidation at the depot the training staffs for the junior leaders and junior soldiers companies arrived 
 shortly before their recruits 0:re 0:cruits and both have settled into the new routine the junior leaders are recruited between 
 16 and 17 years old and 138 of them crossed the threshold in september 0:sep 0:tember they will be with 
 us for 46 weeks which is virtually one year after leave is taken into account the junior soldiers only do 
 31 weeks and to avoid them being underage on passing 0:pass 0:ing out and posting to a battalion they are 
 recruited at the minimum age of 16v2 we take four batches of 54 boys per year both groups do traditional 
 junior infantry training but the leaders concentrate more on leadership development and education than their counterparts concern had been expressed 
 that we might have a resources 0:re 0:sources problem while we tried to find the best fit of adults and 
 juniors but in practice it has been a relatively easy transition the reason is simple the depot has only received 
 40 adult recruits for the entire division for the period september 86 to march 87 the reason is that the 
 regular battalions are approximately 150 men overstrength the strongest division in the infantry in terms of percentage over establishment unfortunately 
 the civil servants are not at all happy about having to pay all these people and are trying hard to 
 slim us down the shortage of recruits could have led to many bored training teams but with careful planning all 
 personnel are either on courses such as education or they have returned to battalions and will be replaced when the 
 numbers start to increase 0:in 0:crease again the depot was officially opened by her majesty the queen on 27 november 
 1986 the event is covered elsewhere 0:else 0:where in this article suffice it to say that the day was a 
 great success and the weather was perfect for the first and last time for several weeks there is now a 
 period of stabilization there have been surprisingly few problems with the new barracks although in the big freeze of early

 77 the light division depot shrewsbury commanding officer lieutenant colonel j k marsham the events of the last six months 
 at the depot were dominated by the closure in june before resettling at the new depot at winchester the pattern 
 of training since april was dictacted by the need to prepare all five platoons ready for the final passing out 
 parade since two platoons alamein and kokima lt angus mackie started in june 85 and the remaining three in september 
 85 anzio lt peter balls corunna lt john wilson and salamanca a good deal of juggling by the training 0:train 
 0:ing officer capt jamie bowden was necessary this was successfully engineerred and the momentum of training was able to be 
 maintained to the end with successful battle camps at sennybridge from late may to mid june credit must go to 
 all members of the training team for leading their platoons through an unusual year of upheaval their aim was to 
 get the maximum number of well trained young soldiers to battalions and this was achieved with 151 juniors 14 bandsmen 
 and 20 buglers marching off to join their battalions at the close on 28 june 1986 over 200 junior soldiers 
 buglers and bandsmen of the light division paraded in form to her majesty 0:majes 0:ty the queen mother at sir 
 john moore barracks shrewsbury 0:shrews 0:bury for the final parade all royal green jacket junior recruits have been trained in 
 shrewsbury for the past four years a relatively short time compared with the 150 years of the depot s existence 
 the day itself was a magnificent success 0:suc 0:cess and went almost without fault with the sun shining throughout her 
 majesty the queen mother arrived on time after a welcoming speech from the colonel of the light infantry she addressed 
 the parade with the following remarks i am delighted to be with you all here today sad though the occasion 
 0:occa 0:sion may be for many of you present i am so pleased to hear that our links with the 
 county of shropshire will be retained through the territorial army as they are elsewhere in our traditional county areas nevertheless 
 for those civilian workers who have given much loyal support over many years to the regiment it will indeed be 
 a blow i join general lang in thanking you for your loyal service and wish you well i con gratulate 
 those on parade who today complete their training i know you have done well here to achieve that under some 
 pressure and i wish you all the very best of good fortune when you join your battalions finally may i 
 congratulate all those of you whose task it is to train our young soldiers i know that it is a 
 demanding time for you and your families but the reward is surely the high standard that we see here today 
 reflecting the great traditions of our regiments js company under command major charlie heyman paraded in front of some 1200 
 people including the colonel commandant of the division general sir david mostyn and general sir roland guy adjutant general her 
 majesty inspected 0:in 0:spected the company and others on parade before witnessing 0:witness 0:ing the traditional double past following the 
 parade her majesty 0:ma 0:jesty crossed the square on foot to talk to parents and depot military and civilian staff 
 before moving across to meet depot children and the best recruits from each platoon her majesty then moved to join 
 officers for lunch in the mess with a large marquee for 200 outside on the lawn after reviewing ranks of 
 old comrades in the afternoon amongst whom was a contingent 0:con 0:tingent of eight stalwarts from the former regiment the 
 oxfordshire 0:ox 0:fordshire and buckinghamshire light infantry who displayed their bowler hats in style her majesty took her leave accompanied 
 0:accom 0:panied by bugle fanfares all the way from the mess to the barrack 0:bar 0:rack gate it had been 
 a memorable day it is important to record how well the divisional depot has performed over the four years of 
 its existence the depot at closure was as happy as it has ever been and the relationship 0:relation 0:ship between 
 light infantrymen and riflemen was one of humorous leg pulling and genuine friendship there should be no doubts for the 
 future of the happiness of a joint depot as always the wo s and sgts mess was the key to 
 success and shrewsbury was lucky to have such an excellent rsm as wol fairclough rgj to see the depot through 
 to the end a sad and historic day for all but happy in the knowledge that the two regiments were 
 to continue their close links in th training of recruits and juniors at winchester which had begun four years before 
 so successfully
