 or opinion made by authors the story of trochu by sheilagh s jameson the trochu settlement was stcirted by a
 small group of french aristocrats who were drawn to western canada largely through their love of adventure and the lure
 of new lands religious troubles in france influenced their emigration although quite indirectly mczny of the frenchmen who came were
 army officers who had resigned their commissions in protest against government orders to assist in the expulsion of religious orders
 of the catholic faith and thus they were free to follow the trails of adventure their choice of the trochu
 location was entirely a matter of chance this was not the planned migration of a group of settlers but something
 which grew gradually out of the dream of one man and the man who originated this vision and persevered until
 it came to fruition was armand trochu closely associated with him were two others joseph devilder who provided initiative and
 capital and leon c eckenf elder who proved a mainspring of vitality and tenacity there were many more who made
 rioted contributions and who played important parts in the developznent of the district but without the guiding force of these
 three the story would have been different and the west would have been deprived of ci colorful page in her
 hisfory armand jean louis leon trochu was born in belle isle oil the coast of brittany in 1857 he was
 the nephew of general louis jules trochu who was the governor of paris in 1870 during the frarico prussian war
 few records are available concerning armcind trochu s ecirly life rt is known that he received his education in st
 francis savier college in vannes brittany and that he lived at st clementin vendee france for a time by occupation
 he was a stock broker in paris from this position to that of a rancher in alberta and the founder
 of a town seems a long step and a remote one but whatever the reasons or circumstances it is one
 which mr trochu took armand trochu located a valley near the buffalo luke trail north of three hills in 1903
 where he established a colony of french settlers the exact date of armand trochu s arrival in canada is not
 known arid the details of his trip across the continent are also lost but it is thought that he arrived
 in calgary in 1902 records show that he stayed in this area for at least a year spending some of
 the time miss jameson is assistant archivist for the glenbow foundation calgary and is a well known alberta historian formerly
 a frequent contributor to the canadian cattlemen magazine she is now secretary of the historical society of alberta this article
 is a condensation of a study of the trochu district which the author andertook for the glenbow foundation she is
 particularly indebted to xavier de beaudrap of trochu for much of the early history at millcxrville on the ranch of
 raymond capital in calgary he met another de maiherbe frenchman a mr tabary who had some money and whom he
 succeeded in inter during this period he visited at the esting in the project they formed a home of mrs
 de chauny in calgary partnership and immediately activity her son louis had spent some time commenced in the valley which
 was working on various ranches in the rose destined to become the original site of bud district and the stories
 of his ex trochu periences decided armand trochu to attempt the ranching business himself lumber was hauled from didsbury so
 in the spring of 1903 he and louis de and in short order a house for each of chauny set
 out in search of a suitable the partners was erected mr tabary ranch site on exploring the foothills brought his
 wife and child out from calcountry north west of calgary mr gary and they too lived on the new trochu
 decided that the land was too ranch rough and muskegs too prevalent so he and his companion set out again
 head just what the situation was between ing towards the east this time they the partners is not clear but
 before went as far as the handhills area where many months mr trochu realized that a chance encounter led them
 to the end the venture was not succeeding and he of their search a half breed rode into decided to
 look for someone else who their camp one night and on learning would have the necessary capital and of their
 search he told them of a place interest in the summer of 1904 he rewhich he considered ideal he had
 been turned to france for this purpose working on a land survey two years previously in the country west of
 the while armand trochu was in france red deer river and there situated not on his money raising project two
 other far from the three hills and close to the countrymen of his found their way by buffalo lake trail
 was a valley he had the path of chance to the trochu district not forgotten these were paul de beaudrap
 and his brother roger the next day armand trochu and m le comte paul de beaudrap had louis de chauny
 crossed the red deer river again and turned in the direction come originally to canada in 1891 but of the
 three hills soon they reached a after spending nine years in the settlevalley or a large coulee just as had
 been ment of the french counts at whitedescribed to them they followed it a wood saskatchewan he returned to short
 distance and stopped here was france when roger de beaudrap forwater bubbling springs as well as a sook his army
 career he persuaded his flowing creek here was shelter and brother to accompany him and make anthe valley had a
 quiet beauty too the other attempt at establishing a new life man of vision knew that he had found in
 a new land so in the spring of 1904 the place he sought they arrived in calgary mr trochu lost
 no time in returning it is not at all surprising being to calgary and consulting officials at frenchmen that they
 made the acquainthe land office he found that the valley tance of mrs de chauny before they had he coveted

 trochu had taken in search of good land made arrangements and purchased this and how they had finally iound the
 land the surrounding country was not ideal spot away to the east and north open for homesteads at this time

 land for his valley and decided that they too would procure some land in the vicinity enterprise as well as
 inspiration and enthusiasm but unfortunately he was paul de beaudrcip soon located a not a wealthy man and he required

 spring with boyd inkster when they camped for the night at assiniboine crossing it was a cold unpleasant night and
 the men were not sleeping easily their unrest might have been added to by the fact that the indians of

 saulteaux indian riding with twc horses following him he bent down it the dim light to see norris better per
 haps or as norris thinks to speak tc him sure that he was one of the indian band norris caught
 him by his long hair and wrestled with him until he was well worn out he was puzzled then to
 know how to get the indian back to the camp for if he left the savage go there he might
 round up his friends and attack norris again at last he hit upon tieing the with his cart of whiskey

 are well provided with churches many of them of the congregation of mission friends founded in sweden by p w
 waldenstrom as a protest against the too worldly national lutheran church whose ministers university graduates were accused of being tainted
 with darwinism and moderism several baptist churches were also prominently in evidence some of the first settlers arrived with their

 s often rolled around before all the threshing was done after the first crop had been harvested and a few
 sacks of wheat were horses and men were housed and fed the result the settlers in lewisville very well if
 not the host s good name would take them to the hobbema re would lose in value when the weather
 serve where there was a flour mill was bad the feeding of all became quite though the flour was coarse
 and diff i a problem when fields were small and cult to use for baking it did keep the prices
 low children were near tears settlers from starving when the interesting and friendly threshers left usually there was a good
 story later a swede named bengston built teller in the crew who thrilled little a flour mill at the south

 oldest sister elizabeth was quite patch close to this trail but we were unhappy when she was called lizzie forbidden
 to go and pick any if the she maintained that was the name for indians were nearby sometimes they only
 one thing the out house the privy would pitch their tepees and tents not the water closet or in later
 years chick far from our place on a level bit of land sales it was supposed to be a comfort
 not at anytime did we find the indians station but nothing could be further unfriendly only once do i remember
 from the truth if you went there in the that my mother was terrified when she dead winter the door
 would not close heard the sound of the war cry coming because during the night the snow had across the
 miles from the hobbema drifted in through the cracks and knot reserve fear gripped her however it holes so that
 a veritable drift had set was a false alarm as nothing happened tied both on the two holer seat and
 on the indians roamed at will and hunted the floor even eaton s or simpson s and trapped on all
 the open land outccitcilogues were icy side of their reserve i never once heard of any hair raising indian tale

 you entered the little demons began to protect their mother was always in quest of knowldomain and you got out
 of there much edge she used to read anything and too soon everything that she could find she read english

 making beds and cooking when on my mother s part had built the fence 11 o clock came around she
 would dash it not only kept out the indians but it madly about getting her work done and prevented the
 cows from eating the car getting dinner ready for the men but rot tops and the spinach and the horses
 in this way much knowledge was stored from rolling in the garden but it didn t up in her ever
 seeking mind keep out the little hands that always picked the red and black currents on as a child i
 remember dad sitting in the side furthest from the house and utter contentment on the backdoor step furthest from mother
 s piercing eye it would be one of those long peaceful summer evenings he would be too the indians in
 the warm spring days physically tired to think so he just sat would trek past our home on the trail
 and drank in god s beauty he was at by the fence we children were always peace with the world
