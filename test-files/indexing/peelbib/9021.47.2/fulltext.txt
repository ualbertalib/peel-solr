 then we proceeded about a the 70 mile house 70 miles from edson mile along the valley of the river
 until here we found three other gents with we came to the ferry landing the banks two teams heading north
 but they were of the river are high precipitous and already making their camp fire we lit very rocky on
 the s side it is thickly ours and had supper by this time our wooded it is the river about
 200 ft bread had run out and now we across at this place commenced our ‘ hard tack biscuits nearly
 like dog biscuits having plenty the ferryman was an old german who of rabbit and fish we had a good
 supper seemed kindhearted but was growling on some boughs of a spruce tree laid on about his job the river
 being low he the pole floor of the shack we made our could not get the ferry to the bank
 so we bed squirrels were running around had to take off our boots and socks and inside and rabbits outside
 they were wade up to our knees after ascending very bold running just past our heads the south bank we
 took a pack trail while we were in bed it rained a little which cut off at least 2 miles
 between through the night and the stream the baptiste and the athabasca rivers running about 6 ft away the owls
 ‘ hoo hoo the density on the forest some arriving at the athabasca we hollered spruce trees about 4 ft
 thick gave our for the ferry and a middle aged swede surroundings a weird sound irrespective responded to our call
 the athabasca is of this we had pleasant dreams a large river probably 400 ft across just now although larger
 when it is in full sunday 22 nd at 5 am when we turned stream at the ferryman s house
 we out i lit the fire and prepared breakfast stopped and had dinner got hay and oats we were off
 at 6 30 we were compelled for the horse and stayed overnight here to travel on sunday for there was
 we met two gents from edmonton who practically no horse feed we ran out of were going 600 miles down
 the river in a oats the day previous and the poor horse small boat one was a game protector had
 to rustle his grub we knew too at and i think the other was a bush the athabasca river there
 was a protector we ate a mighty big dinner having travelled nearly 20 miles since breakfast which we ate at
 6 15 a m at the ferryman s house we saw the claws and foot of a grizzly he shot
 just about half a mile from his house the hind foot measured 11 1 2 inches duriiig the afternoon and
 evening we had rain and sleet pitching our blankets on the floor we rolled in for the night monday september
 23 we were up before daybreak and had breakfast by the light of the lamp packing up we lit out
 about 3 miles out we commenced to ascend the athabasca hill the ground was covered with snow about one and
 a half inches deep the grade as a result was very slippery the trail after rounding the hill followed the
 course of a large canyon and up this we went for about 3 miles up up we went a fog
 all around and the sun endeavoring to break through which it managed to do about 11 o clock the trail
 was dug out of the hillside nearly all the way up and woe to anyone who went over the trees
 now were not quite so thick and smaller but after dinner the regular thick ones were encountered the trail in
 places was fierce at times going up to our knees in mud our journey during the afternoon was very hilly
 round large hills one seemingly about 800 ft high up winding valleys and goodness knows where descending one long hill
 we ran into the 27 mile stopping place but only being 3 p m we continued to the 20 mile
 stopping place 20 mi from edson which we reached at about 4 30 here the stopping house was run by
 a frenchman and his wife a nice stream runs close past his house he has pigs hens horses cows etc
 today we travelled 32 miles in the evening other two men came in with a wagon one seemed about half
 drunk they had endeavored to make their way to grande prairie but the snowstorm on sunday night had made the
 trails very bad so they got cold feet and turned back at bed time we were shown upstairs to our
 beds what a difference between this bed and the apology of one we had used for a week it was
 the first time i had had my clothes off for 7 days so one can imagine with what pleasure i
 got into a decent bed evidently i was not destined to sleep alone for before long i got several unwelcome
 visitors pilgrims of the night bedbugs which certainly kept me company and after all i would far rather have been
 sleeping on the prairie or on some poles as in the 100 mi house or on the boughs of the
 fir trees in a leaky shack as in the 70 mi house or even in a barn on some hay
 as the first night after we left bear creek how i waited for daybreak and when it came i was
 not long before i was downstairs above top stopping house at the little smoky river on the edson trail above

 taken farming at jasper pass geo b mclaughlin who returned last week from the tete jaune cache gives a very
 interesting account of the farming operations carried on in the pass by an american trapper named swift who has made
 his home there for several years past swift is located 1 8 miles within the pass beyond site of the
 jasper house and four miles this side of the site of the old henry house he has about 16 acres
 under cultivation fenced in two fields and his crop this year is about 400 bushels of wheat and 60 sacks
 of potatoes besides turnips carrots radishes and a little barley the grain and roots are all of good quality his
 only imported implement is a plow his harrow is home made and in place of a wagon he uses a
 home made sled he has built a mill in which to grind the produce of his farm the grinding apparatus
 is imported and is on the principle of an exaggerated coffee mill he has taken out a ditch and built
 a water wheel by which he secures power to make his mill grind at the rate of about 100 pounds
 a day the wheat is of good sample and is red rife swift has both horses and cattle he winters
 them chiefly on hay and straw but the horses can frequently rustle for themselves all winter on prairie creek on
 the athabasca some distance this side of the pass also at yellowhead lake in the pass but on the other

 the will of god in our lives this can be done by reading his word and meeting with him in
 regular and quiet hours of meditation thus do we foil the attempts of satan to make us disregard our lord
 s commands 2 having acquired their moral authority as workers together with god awms leaders attempted to resist the inexorable
 pull of the secular forces surrounding them in order to preserve the credibility of the society and continue working under
 their own auspices 2 with these implications in mind women s missionary societies sought to secure the perpetuity of their
 enterprise by inculcating christian mission values among their most malleable recruits the children members of the awms believed they had
 created an organization whose membership flowed from cradle to grave 22 children as well as being considered amenable subjects for
 conversion were effective agents of mission 23 miss mitchell a presbyterian woman s missionary society pwms home mission worker described
 a little boy trained in the mission home who led his parents to jesus by his talk about him 24
 for children of immigrant families who attended the mission schools we offer to teach any child along spiritual intellectual lines
 and so to become leaders among their own people 25 groups of these children provided proof of the success of
 the evangelization and assimilation efforts of the awms through performances of skits and choral work at presbyterial district and provincial
 meetings wms officers were to lead by example and encourage their own children to participate in mission work if they
 expected others to do so the society was explicit about its recruiting practices observing i t is a well known
 fact that many of our most efficient aux workers are graduates of a mb mission band and many of our
 missionaries in the field now tell us that it was in the mb that they first got their desire for
 missionary service 27 in order to keep the children interested band leaders were instructed to secure curios pictures and costumes
 which were accessible through church offices and visiting missionaries since the woman s christian temperance union wctu targeted children for
 their temperance program materials were already developed and available for temperance education which was mandatory for the mwms bands 9
 the wctu and awms were in favour of public school programs which would instill temperance ideals and christian values in
 the future citizens of alberta to maintain the children s enthusiasm both evangelically based organizations held extracurricular activities such as
 public lectures as well as contests where special medals and pins were awarded 3 in the awms banners were awarded
 to mission bands that achieved the largest percentage of increase in membership and funds each year presentations were held on
 public occasions such as a provincial meeting or a rally day thus alberta women sought to maintain the traditional ideology
 of family and anglo protestant religious and moral values their actions had a significant impact on both public opinion and
 provincial legislation reforms during the interwar period alberta history i spring 1999 purchased for daughters in their home auxiliary potentially
 securing their future interest mission circles for teen age girls provided an all round approach to personal development which included
 intellectual physical social and religious development 56 the awms was prepared to mentor circle members who might be persuaded to
 enter the mission field the awms made its strongest appeal during the teen years utilizing the romantic appeal of mission

 few years which many of them had the opportunity to do many missionaries as well as mission workers were former
 members of the wms and attributed their career choice to their education and fellowship in the society while young women
 were the central facilitating the promotion of mission work to a larger audience 3 the wms did not encourage parents
 to turn over the religious training of their young solely to the church but to recognize their own duties in
 relation to this task women who displayed eternal vigilance and encessant sic prayer would succeed in sending their children from
 the family altar strengthened for the world s battles 32 the power of the mother s influence over her young

 of meetings discussion of mission work at home and help in directing small coins towards the mitebox instead of treats
 the discipline of self sacrifice was best learned early mothers were urged to help their children save for junior memberships
 in the wms life memberships could be focus of the awms boys were eligible for membership however boys and the
 wms were an uncomfortable match programs were directed towards the interests of girls and women and it was difficult to
 keep boys interested in band work the actual number of boys enrolled in the awms is impossible to ascertain from
 the records however one co educational band in calgary reported that twenty of its sixty members were boys 89 there
 were several strategies employed to keep boys in the bands one approach was to have them plant wms vegetable gardens
 and to sell the produce in the fall at the same sale girls would sell their fancy work 4 the
 pwms of high river recommended using books that would particularly interest boys such as the black bearded barbarian 1912 written

 history spring 1999 hagiographical narrative of the life of george leslie mackay the first canadian presbyterian missionary to formosa exciting
 descriptions of life in a strange and sometimes dangerous land are appealingly combined with prescriptive literature and biblical metaphors extolling
 a life of religious dedication one anecdote describes mackay slaying a giant serpent which had invaded his study 42 a
 common theme in the prescriptive literature emphasized the exemplary christian family life provided by married missionaries for the edification of
 foreign peoples a dual purpose was served by these vignettes first of relating the process of mission work by example
 as well as inculcating the value of a christian family life for the impressionable young male reader 43 while the
 wms was a women s organization there were instances where men were admitted in 1921 central methodist church calgary had
 seventeen honorary life members all men what had prompted some societies to allow men into the organization 44 obvious advantages
 of male membership included the possibility of increased financial backing greater prestige within the community and a significantly larger membership
 count despite this alberta branch ruled there was no constitutional provision for male membership and forbade further soliciting of men
 45 there are two possible explanations for this response from branch officers a desire to maintain the wms as an
 exclusively female organization or to avoid censure from the church fathers who would consider this an encroachment on their membership
 clergymen were often present at formal events of the missionary societies serving both in ceremonial and advisory capacities while the
 presbyterian women conducted their own elections concluding with a prayer the methodist process required a clergyman to oversee the elections
 46 the latter ritual was maintained by the united church woman s missionary society ucwms including the installation service which
 set apart the officers in their new duties and responsibilities 47 they believed the service conducted by a clergyman served
 to re affirm our purpose and re dedicate our lives to the great tasks to which god has called us
 48 the inclusion of the ministry in their electoral process signified the desire or need for an endorsement of the
 newly elected executive by the church this validated the authority they would wield both in mission work and the spiritual
 stewardship of their members the awms was forced to realign its mission priorities as growing numbers of medical practitioners and
 government social workers were drawn into the mission field which had been its exclusive purvue prayer as an activating force
 for reform paled in comparison to the scientific managerial style of the new professionals and the moral authority of the
 societies declined the influences of secularization were impossible for the awms to counteract the demand for missionary workers lessened as
 missions were replaced by government or municipally administered schools and hospitals ukrainian young women who heeded ‘ the call could

 like there for an immigrant at the time i wasn t sure what they were talking about i stayed in
 the kitchen and played with my by baby son lief alma jorgensen finally my husband told me that he had
 decided to move to canada i really as told to peter morgan didn t want to go i was happy
 in denmark in spite of all the difficulties getting work i pointed out that we late in 1945 some young
 on may 7 1942 1 married theodore would have to learn a new language johann jorgensen in the city hall
 in and we didn t know much about mormon missionaries started lubeck germany my husband was a canada in the
 little village school i dane working as a civilian in lubeck attended near lubeck we didn t learn visiting us
 one of the young the next day i received a notice from the much about other countries i had a
 nazi authorities telling me that because vague picture of trees mountains and men was a farmer s son from i
 had married a dane i was no longer a snow but my husband was excited german citizen i was given
 twenty four about going and i had been brought up magrath he and my husband hours to leave the country
 as it to believe that where your husband goes happened that night there was a major you go too air
 raid on lubeck and the railway lines spent many an evening talking out of the city were severely damaged the
 mormon missionaries said that the so it was more than two weeks before we church would look after us when
 we got about canada and what life could leave germany to magrath we needed however to raise some money since
 we were could be like there for an we settled first with my mother in law determined to pay all
 our costs in aarhus denmark then my husband ourselves we didn t want to begin our immigrant got a job
 driving senior officers of the life in a new country owing money german army in hjorring we lived someone told
 us that if you let the there until the war ended when it did government pay you had to go
 work in work became very difficult for my the sugar beet fields for them husband to find we got by
 with the money he earned doing odd jobs and my mother in law had loaned us the from the little
 i could make from money for the materials to build a small dressmaking house my husband and his brothers had
 done all the construction we would about this time late in 1945 some have to sell the house anyway and
 young mormon missionaries started hoped that we would get enough for it to visiting us my husband had been pay
 back the loan and pay for our brought up as a mormon one of the passage to canada young men
 was a farmer s son from magrath alberta he and my husband meanwhile with help from the young spent many
 an evening talking about boy from magrath we wrote to the alberta history spring 1999 canadian embassy in copenhagen to
 find out what we needed to do to emigrate then came months of letter writing and form filling we made
 three trips to copenhagen over the next year luckily my sister in law lived there so we were able to
 stay with her in the spring of 1948 we went back to copenhagen for our medical examination and vaccinations it
 was then that the canadian authorities found out that i was eight months pregnant soon after we returned home to
 hjorring we got a letter from the embassy telling us we must wait until three months after the delivery of
 my baby before we could emigrate they said it was too risky for me to travel so it wasn t
 until july that we finally got permission and were able to book our passage we were given a list of
 things to take we were able to sell our house and get enough money to pay back my motherin law
 pay for our passage and have a little money to take with us we were only allowed to take 100
 canadian so we hid about 200 danish krone in the clothes we packed i had to sell all our furniture
 but what broke my heart was having to sell my singer sewing machine my mother had got it when she
 was a young bride and i remember my father being so careful in keeping it oiled and clean it came
 to me when my mother died and i was so proud of it i also sold the baby carriage i
 was using for my daughter annette and i got more money than i had paid for it i then had
 a special basket woven by a blind man in town it had handles on the side but with the baby
 inside it needed two of us to carry it i put in a cushion for a mattress and a small
 rubber sheet we were due to leave from aarhus on august 12 the night before we left we stayed with
 friends in hjorring and had a farewell party the next day our friends drove us to the railway station to
 begin our journey that would end in southern alberta in aarhus we caught a boat that would take us to
 southampton england it left at 11 00 a m and arrived in southampton early the next morning we shared a
 cabin with six or seven other people we slept on bunk beds i had our baby daughter annette with me
 and our son lief slept with my husband annette and i were in an upper bunk there was a woman
 in the lower bunk who was noisily seasick all through the night it was a horrible start to our journey
 we were glad to reach southampton and get a little sleep in the hotel that canadian immigration had booked us
 into a danish couple who lived in southampton came to meet us they spoke good english and wrote a note
 for me to use on the ship and train it said that i couldn t speak english i was to
 use this when i needed help we were taken to the dock by bus the next afternoon i couldn t
 believe it when i saw how big the boat was that we were to sail in it seemed to go
 on for ever and it was so tall it was the r m s aquitania the canadian government had chartered
 it to take emigrants to canada above in 1948 the author and her family left europe on the rmsacquitania seen
 here bound for canada alberta history spring 1999 when i got on board i was disappointed for i was placed
 in a cabin for women only while my husband was at the other end of the boat with the men
 i was stuck with a two and a half year old boy and a four month old daughter without my
 husband to help me i was sharing a cabin with ten other women two of them were nuns they had
 curtains around their beds so that we could not watch them dress and undress nobody said very much at first
 but then two of the ladies started talking it was not in any language i knew as i listened to
 the others speak i began to realize that there was nobody there who spoke danish or german the two languages
 i knew the beds were not bunk beds but they were very close together there was just room for annette
 s basket between my bed and the bed of my neighbour it seemed forever before the ship started moving i
 knew that very soon i would have to get some milk for the baby i wasn t sure what to
 do or where to go i couldn t leave the children they would have to come with me i left
 the cabin and went down a long corridor there were a few signs but i couldn t read them i
 presume they were in english there were people moving about but i felt too nervous to approach them eventually i
 saw a man wearing a white apron i followed him and heard loud voices and the banging of pans i
 had found the kitchen taking out the note our danish friends in southampton had written i held it toward the
 nearest man he looked a little startled i felt like a little girl in school giving a note to the
 teacher it was very embarrassing he said something to me took the bottle from my hand and disappeared into another
 part of the kitchen later he came back with the bottle full of milk the milk was cold i pointed
 to the bottle and at one of the huge ranges he seemed to understand perhaps he was a father he
 got a huge saucepan and put a little bit of water in it and put the pan on the hotplate
 after a minute or two he gave the bottle back to me i sprinkled a bit of the milk on
 my forearm it was hot but i thought by the time i had got back to the cabin it would
 be okay getting back wasn t as terrifying as i thought it would be i began to notice signs with
 numbers and arrows on them i guessed they must be cabin numbers even so i was very relieved when i
 finally found my way back to the cabin i had to make that journey to the kitchen many times during
 the next five days but each time it got a little bit easier when i appeared in the kitchen the
 men knew what i wanted and i didn t have to show my note sometime during that evening one of
 the nuns must have heard me talking to my son in german she called across to me in german it
 felt like a huge weight had dropped off my shoulders i had someone whom could understand me someone i could
 talk to my husband i only saw at meal times and then he would go off until the next meal
 i was below while on the rms acquitania the author experienced problems looking after her tsvo children because she could
 speak only danish and gerynan dalberta history spring 1999 so angry i never could find him the boat about the
 third day the boy broke out in was so big a rash one of the nuns fetched a doctor but
 nobody could find my husband that the next morning at breakfast i told him night at supper i really gave
 it to him but to stay close as i had washing to do he he still stayed away could take
 our son and look after him there was a laundry room just opposite when we arrived in halifax i wasn
 t the cabin after i had washed the clothes sure what i felt the city looked so and annette s
 diapers i put them in the different from anything i was used to drying room next door when i came
 certainly it was nothing like lubeck or back three hours later they were gone copenhagen we were taken to a
 somebody had stolen them in my dormitory with many of the other anxiety i ran out into the corridor passengers
 and didn t get a chance to see grabbed the first steward i could find the city the next morning
 we were and started to tell him in german what taken by bus to the railway station and had happened
 he shrugged said put on a train the train was dirty at something in english and walked off least on
 the outside and looked ver y old hurried back to the cabin fortunately it was just for immigrants getting off
 the one of the nuns was there i told her the boat when we had settled in our car the
 story she went and found a steward but porter came in he was a negro i had he told her
 there wasn t much he could never seen one before and was do with over a thousand passengers on overcome
 with curiosity i was so board stunned i couldn t say anything in the next few days during all the
 time we the only diaper i had left was the one were on the train he was very kind to
 us annette was wearing i told the nun and she went off to the kitchen she told me again we
 were lucky because in our that she had found a baker there and had car were two other danish immigrants
 asked for any empty flour bags he gave her some and the nun and i opened them who spoke english
 every time we up and cut diapers out of them after stopped the porter would come to ask us if
 we wanted anything from the station that whenever i did a wash i hung the he would ask the da
 nish couple who clothes over the back of my bed to dry i then asked us we would tell the
 danes wasn t taking any more chances and they would pass on our order to him i still remember him
 with gratitude every night on the boat i had to get up and go to the kitchen to get a
 bottle of milk for annette when i did the the seat of the car we travelled in made woman in
 the bed next to me got up and into a double bed at night with a shelf sat on the
 end of her bed there she above which let down to make another waited until i returned and then she
 bed our son slept above and we slept climbed back into bed she didn t speak below with annette in
 her basket there german or danish so we couldn t talk to were curtains to pull across so nobody each
 other was she watching my could see us children for me did she think i was stealing things i never
 knew when annette s diapers were wet i put them under the little mattress in her basket during all the
 time we were on board the and waited until night time then when aquitania i never went out on deck
 i most people were asleep i would take crossed the atlantic ocean without ever them to the washroom to wash
 them out really seeing it i spent most of my time washing diapers looking after the annette was very good
 but she was so children and bathing them my husband small she slept most of the time lief on said
 he would not come into the cabin the other hand used to get very restless because it was full of
 women once or it was difficult to keep him amused twice he did take our son for a walk sometimes
 he would get so frustrated at r i above this is a view of the author s children lief and
 annette shortly after their arrival in magrath alberta history spring 1999 of us that his son had sent him but
 we didn t know what he looked like we looked around the station but there didn t seem to be
 anybody waiting the platform cleared and we were left on our own we waited and waited and then went into
 the station restaurant to sit down i needed milk for annette and tried to show the girl there by holding
 out the bottle when she realized that we didn t speak english she took the bottle and disappeared into the
 kitchen she was back in a few minutes with nice warm milk she knew about babies still we waited once
 in a while we would walk a little way out of the station but carrying annette s basket was awkward
 once i fell asleep in the restaurant i was so tired finally at 4 00 p m the man arrived
 and found us he could not speak danish or german and so we had to use a sort of sign
 language we loaded our cases into his car and he drove us to magrath at his farm waiting for us
 was a dane who had arrived from denmark the year before from him we learned that the farmer did not
 being able to run around that he would burst into tears then my husband would take him for a walk
 along the corridors of the train we ate in the dining car the food was a bit strange to us
 but it was good and lots of it especially after the shortages of the war that we had known one
 thing i remember clearly eating turkey for the first time that i did enjoy the train stopped many times but
 we were scared to get out we saw other passengers doing that but we weren t sure if that was
 okay besides we were a little afraid we would get left behind if we went to the station washroom or
 out into the street like some people did fifty not meet us on time because he was too busy working
 in his sugar beet fields they had a special meal ready for us including a danish cake we were beginning
 to feel not so lost after the meal we went with the dane to his house in town he had
 a room we could stay in we did we stayed there for a month and then we moved into his
 garage where we lived for the next two years so started our life in a new country years later i
 can t remember much about the countryside we passed through the little i remember seemed to be all trees and
 rocks we arrived at lethbridge at 10 00 am on august 27 1948 the porter helped us get our luggage
 out but when we tried to give him some money for being so kind to us he wouldn t take
 it a man was supposed to meet us he was the father of the mormon missionary we had entertained in
 denmark he had a photo alma jorgensen a pioneer of magrath and calgary is a resident of the brentwood nursing
 home calgary peter morgan is a volunteer at the home and assisted her in preparing this story above like so
 many other immigrant fatnilies the jorgensons quickly adjusted to life in canada this is a view of the family in
 magrath about 1952 shortly before they moved to calgary alberta history spring 1999 a ne comer s yie of calgary

 my eyes were busy viewing the fine stone buildings stores paved streets the passing automobiles and pedestrians the people did
 not seem to hurry and rush as in american cities yet all seemed intent upon some business when the street
 car appeared and i took my place at the window and passed along the busy street and then through the
 residential part of the city i gained some clearer impressions of the activity and general character of the city it
 seemed a long way to my destination on 12 th avenue but now i know i took he blue belt
 line going east instead of west and thus almost completed a circle before reaching the wigwams where i had arranged
 beforehand to stay however this precaution was unnecessary for calgary has good hotel service in the alberta yale queen s
 grand union and imperial and in such semi private residences as braemar lodge and the wigwam the proprietors of these
 houses are efficient hosts and aid their patrons all they can then there is the ywca a new and finely
 equipped building situated only four blocks from the cpr station the brick building is well furnished with single and double
 rooms large dining hall gymnasium swimming tank lecture and reception rooms under the management of miss bradshaw who acts as
 superintendent and housemother the group of eager responsive and well meaning young women arc well looked after this institution is
 maintained wholly by voluntary subscriptions its formal opening has just taken place of its building furnishings and organization the ladies
 of calgary are to be congratulated upon this exhibition of conservative mind to attribute crudeness to a new city they
 cannot understand the exhilaration and spirit of expectancy of better things to come that exists in a rapidly growing place
 one literally sees with one s own eyes the city growing hour by hour and day by day not generation
 by generation particularly is this so of calgary whose population in the last four years has increased at the rate
 of nine thousand per year houses and schools cannot be erected quickly enough to accommodate the vast influx of people
 who pour daily into the city as a consequence of the demand being greater than the supply rent and produce
 is higher than in a city of slower growth towards the close of the fourth day of my journey we
 reached calgary and bidding goodbye to my fellow passengers i walked through the cpr station i had expected to hear
 the usual babble of voices of cab cab this way ladies and the various hotels called out but such was
 not the case all was quietness though at the entrance of the front door at their proper stand stood some
 hacks and over at the left were arranged the transfer trucks i handed my checks to the truckman and walked
 for the first time upon the streets of above as one oft ic 1 tails stations ott the trans canada

 order to direct them to its doors two trained deaconesses are employed whose duty it is to meet every train
 night and day and conduct the strangers to its hospitable shelter any woman night or day who knocks at its
 doors for entrance will always find a welcome on the morning after my arrival i walked downtown to obtain a
 view of the interior of some of the stores as this trip had rather a unique impression upon me i
 shall narrate some of its details there was no spirit of loneliness for all things interest a newcomer even the
 gaily coloured posters on 1 st street west attracted my attention in street cars hotels stores cafes post office all
 are talking lots lots land land just on the market double your money etc etc by this time i too
 was beginning to feel the spirit of the game and as each day and hour this sensation was repeated i
 became infatuated also by this lust of gain i confess i was ready to be caught in the whirl but
 as i became accustomed to these sayings in the course of time i began to look upon the real estate
 in a much more rational view although there is money to be made on land investment in this rapidly growing
 city yet the mad craze to risk your all to gain more presents other points of view in which it
 pays sometimes to be cautious before completing my walk on that memorable first morning in calgary in which i visited
 a great many stores i came upon many views of the city and surrounding country of alberta it was the
 photographs of the remarkable albertan produce that attracted me though i have lived for a good many years in a
 small country village and have had some experience in the growing of vegetables yet these of alberta beat all record
 the size of the cucumbers were so large that twenty of them had succeeded in breaking down the forewheel of
 a double horse load while the potatoes and cabbages were even more correspondingly developed many other wonderful productions of the
 soil of alberta i saw and immediately procured several different kinds to send to my astonished friends in the east
 on being told my collection were a certain price i counted out what i thought would come to fifty six
 cents i gave sixty and waited for my change and waited finally i said i am waiting for my change
 i shall never forget the amused expression of the clerk and i learned for the first time that in buying
 things in calgary the people must have so much money that they do not use any common sense cents whatever
 having told you of the chief items concerning my first day in calgary let me now tell you my impressions
 of the country districts of alberta i had not been in calgary many days when i was invited to spend
 the weekend in a small town south of calgary needless to say i was delighted with the prospect as i
 was anxious to see western if a stranger entering calgary on a sunday were to judge of the spirituality of
 its citizens by the large proportion of churches and church goers the city would bear a record for this trait
 of character but of this we are unable to judge alberta history spring 1999 life in all its phases i
 was met at the coyote would look at us perched upon a were nailed to the wall we were heartily
 station by my friends and taken to their distant mound and then would glide off welcomed by the host who
 greeted us in house scarcely had i time to doff my in the gait of a fox to regions beyond
 a grey flannel shirt and corduroy wraps before dinner was served which trousers as we all sat in the kitchen
 consisted of wild duck shot that day we in passing near a big slough we came beside the fire he
 told us of his daily all did justice to the meal upon a large flock of ducks accordingly routine of
 housework and when he the boys got out of the carriage and came to his description of bread making seated
 afterwards in front of a log quickly succeeded in bringing down it was truly laughable blazing fireplace for the evening
 was two not with one shot though chilly we planned a fishing trip for the well you see i make
 it from morrow i could hardly wait for the just as we were nearing our destination ‘ sourdough the secret
 is when is the morning for was i not to have my first we saw two prairie chickens huddled right
 time to punch it own and the drive across the virgin prairies of together on a fence quietly we drew
 average woman is not strong enough to alberta all sorts of visions of typical rein and my lady companion drew
 forth punch down a big batch of bread of western life with its branded cattle her rifle and took aim
 carefully with a course we all laughed my friend and i cowboys etc as depicted in the books little flutter
 the creature fell particularly enjoyed the joke even of several western writers came before though at the expense of the
 weakness of my mind nevertheless the morning did on reaching the bank of the river which our sex it was
 now growing late so arrive though it was dark and was very steep some of the boys bidding our genial
 host goodbye we threatening yet amid wraps fishing unhitched the horses taking them to an started off again for home
 reaching tackle guns rugs slickers and last but empty shack some distance back the there quite late but all expressing
 the not least the ample dinner basket we rest of us started to prepare dinner but outing full of enjoyment
 bade goodbye to the hostess and started where was the firewood not a stick to off behind a span of
 beautiful bays be found plenty of partly bleached from this digression of country life i there were ten in the
 party altogether bones but no wood we travelled the shall take you back to calgary and and as we sped
 for mile after mile valley up and down and in doing so continue with the description of its across country
 i gained some idea of the came upon a buffalo skull this was advantages prairie district of alberta we followed
 quite a find it was partly buried in the the old macleod trail for some miles soil but we took
 it home as a souvenir the general plan of the city is so then turned northwest towards the we at
 length returned to the party with mathematically arranged that it is easily direction of the bow river we had not
 but very few pieces of slender twigs understood the streets of the city run gone a great distance when rounding
 a however in the meantime one of the north and south the avenues east and cutbank we came suddenly in
 view of men knowing the conditions had west the cpr station which is on the mountains there stood in solemn
 brought a plentiful supply of firewood centre street divides the city into two grandeur the mighty rockies the sun accordingly
 dinner was soon ready after sections east and west calgary the was shining on their snow capped peaks which the
 fishing began we were names of the streets and avenues are as they pierced the sky we drew rein fortunate
 in securing a good catch of clearly marked in the cement sidewalks and feasted our eyes upon the spectacle splendid
 trout by this time we were as well as being plainly printed in large though in reality they were more
 than ready to start for home while enamel letters blue ground on the fifty miles away yet they appeared so
 houses of each and every corner the near one more adventure completes this numbers of the houses are marked in
 the interesting fishing trip while going hundreds each block occupying one the memory of that beauty picture is home a
 different way we stopped at a hundred numbers a house could at once firmly fixed upon my mind it was
 an homesteader s the owner of which one be located in any part of the city inspiration to the soul
 and truly did the of the party knew fortunately the psalmist know the sensation when he rancher had just come
 home the shack the street car service which is the pay said i will life up mine eyes unto the
 consisted of two rooms a kitchen as you enter system is owned and hills from whence cometh my help which
 served as living room as well and operated by the city and although it has a bedroom this kitchen was
 very large only been in running order a year and a further on this view was lost and the clean
 and comfortable it had a couch half yet it is paying a surplus of 13 per vast prairies rolled before
 us sometimes and rocking chair at one end at the other cent to the city already the citizens have broken
 by an occasional homesteader s a cook stove and cupboard a few chairs voted a half million dollars to increase
 shack and sheds or herds of branded two tables one by a window and one in the routes and double
 tracking more cattle sheep or hogs now and then a the centre of the room several pictures divisions i may
 say here that a word of alberta history i spring 1999 commendation is due to the courtesy of the street
 car officials in no other city have i found conductors so considerate for their passengers also is this also true
 of the average male citizen one hears sometimes in the east of the rough westerner but indeed many men from
 other cities may take a lesson in politeness from the citizens of calgary in their courtesy to the fair sex
 in crowded street cars the city provides for personal protection in stationing some forty five policemen at different intervals all
 over the city whose duty it is to maintain order and dignity in its streets it is a fact quite
 noticeable to strangers that though these men are of fine physique yet are of a much younger type than the
 usual policeman of eastern cities the facilities for shopping from the woman s standpoint are ample for her needs almost
 any article of ready made clothing fine fabrics smallware boots shoes fine china well designed furniture handsome jewelery mantles and
 cloaks are displayed in the windows of the large stores they are so varied in style as to even suit
 the taste of the most fastidious of women the grocery stores fruit vendors and butchers shops are well up to
 date both in variety and quality the window dressers of these stores take great care in the artistic and varied
 arrangements of their wares if a stranger entering calgary on a sunday were to judge of the spirituality of its
 citizens by the large proportion of churches and church goers and if the half million dollars that is to be
 spent this year in the erection or remodelling of others the city would bear a record for this trait of
 character but of this we are unable to judge it goes to prove however that the citizens do take an
 interest in things more than temporal the church also contributes largely to the social element strangers are welcomed and find
 ready access for the development of this part of their nature in its various weekly societies and other organizations connected
 with its management perhaps this cordiality of spirit is due to the fact that all are strangers to a certain
 extent and through this common bond are glad to offer the hand of fellowship to a more recent citizen the
 society element of calgary is quite gay in its fashionable entertainments of at homes luncheons dances and bridge parties they
 open their beautiful homes often to the entertainment of strangers especially at the christmas season many a youth or maiden
 would have had to spend a cheerless and homeless christmas were it not for the genuine unselfishness that prompts the
 holders of homes to invite strangers to spend their christmas with them ladies of homes send their names to the
 ministers of the churches to send two three or four names as the case may be of homeless people then
 invitations are sent to these persons to dine with them at christmas or new year s many a sad and
 lonely heart has been cheered by this cordial hospitality a new field for intellectual modernism among the women of calgary
