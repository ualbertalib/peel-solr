 we had all dent physician at cadomin mountain park and passed our final exams and also the medical luscar also
 had small hospitals but on the east council exams allowing us to practice medicine arm there were fewer large collieries
 and fewer anywhere in the british empire so now i had miners about 800 men plus a few families and
 medical certificates proving i knew all there was only one doctor p a macdonald lived at mile to know about
 medicine i also had the prettiest girl friend at the royal alex hospital but i had charles mckenzie was born
 in watford ontario in no money and no job 1897 and moved to the okotoks high river area in just
 about then an offer came in for a locum 1907 where he grew up after receiving his medical tenens on
 the coal branch i jumped at the degr ee he practised in the coal branch and saskatchance and was soon
 off on my first job as a chewan then decided to specialize in maternity care after further training in the
 united states he pracuoctor tised obstetrics and gynecology in minneapolis for the coal branch was a stnng of mining com

 were re archives board university of saskatchewan saskatoon 57 n owo quired to provide some sort of medical care for
 47 or sterco where the largest pit mine was 30 1927 dick and his crew stopped at mile 47 operated
 by the sterling collieries he was paid for lunch then they went down to the end of the on a
 per capita basis the amount per capita line at mile 55 turned around on the y and were depending on
 the proximity of the miners to mile due back through sterco about 3 00 p m that 47 miners at
 miles 47 and 48 paid 2 00 per meant i had three hours to meet p a and get inmonth
 for medical care miners at mile 50 paid structions before he would catch the train to ed 1 00 per
 month and those farther away paid 50 son of course p a was more than excited about cents per month
 besides the per capita fees his honeymoon and told me very little didn t p a was paid by the
 workmen s compensa i know everything anyway having passed the tion board for his services to workers injured on council
 exams and being a licentiate of the the job since mining is one of the more dan medical council of
 canada p a did take the gerous professions and injuries were common time to give me his favourite prescription the
 the doctor did quite well from this source of miner s special income p a had been a doctor on
 the east arm of the fill an 8 ounce bottle half full of soda bicarb coal branch for years in
 1926 the miners had add 2 ounces aromatic cascara sagrada add 10 drops of peppermint demanded more medical services so
 the company fill with water had built a doctor s office with two hospital beds don t shake too hard
 or it will blow right beside the track and almost under the coal tipple at sterco they also hired a
 nurse but she the miners all eat too much and too fast had not been there very long when she
 and p a said p a then they get down in those cold fell in love soon they were married
 and the mines and get all bound up because they don t company supplied them with a fine house want
 to go out in the cold so i have this special my job was to act as the doctor while
 pa and medicine for them it s dark and it s strong and his bride went on a three month
 honeymoon start the miners know it good because it blows the ing july 1 1927 i already knew something of
 cork out it s what they want the topography of the country because i had with that final and only
 word of instruction worked on a survey party two years before and p a and his bride left on their
 honeymoon and had lived all summer in the area but i knew i was the doctor on the coal branch
 nothing about mining and much less than i that night i was awakened by a pounding at thought about medicine
 the door there were no roads at all in that country in doc come quick there s a baby coming
 1927 not even a good cow trail so the only okay nght away i shouted means of transportation was walking
 or the train who s that the voice answered you re at one time there had been pr ivate handcars
 and not the doc speeders on the tracks but so much traffic i m the new doctor i answered dr
 macdeveloped that the companies ruled there were donald is on his honeymoon to be no more speeders or handcars without
 okay said the voice but huriy authorization from the district superintendent at so hurry we did somehow we had gotten
 a edson nobody could ever find the superinten handcar and down the twisting track we went dent so there wee
 few handcars there was of at 2 00 a m to my first obstetrical case at mile course a train
 that ran back and forth from ed 55 i had done six deliveries as a student and inson to the
 various communities on the coal terne so i reviewed in my mind what dr delee branch three times a week
 the train went from had said about the first examination and the ques edson down the west arm to cadomin
 moun tions one asked oneself by that time we were tam park backed into luscar and returned to ed at
 the end of the line fortunately i had outfitted son on the alternate three days it went down myself for
 obstetrics and had my own grip i the east arm to sterco coal valley and found out later that p
 a believed in only the most foothills turned around at lovett at mile 55 natural kind of childbirth and had
 nothing for and went back to edson we called the train the obstetrical cases in his bag we hurried up
 the try weakly the conductor was fat old dick hill to a cabin about 200 yards away thompson as the
 doctor i was given a pass to in the only room about 18 feet by 20 feet ride in the
 caboose three men played cards in the far corner using i arrived on the try weakly at noon on june
 the only lamp directly in front of me lay a 2 a cup of coffee then back i went to
 steito pumping the handcar down the track my first night on the coal branch my first delivery my first day
 in practice communications on the coal branch were a trifle unusual besides summons by a night courier pounding on the
 door the railroad had both a telephone and a telegraph the telegraph mile 55 if you rang the phone anyone
 line ended at mile 47 but the phone went on to anywhere along the line might answer and only if
 you were lucky did you reach the person you wanted to talk with it was quite a hit or miss
 system at sterco we were fortunate to have a telegraph operator he was named mckibbon 1 or mac and was
 officially on duty eight hours ifr a day however since he lived in the same box car that served as
 the telegraph station he would often answer both phone and wire at all hours and take messages mac and i
 became good friends and he often took messages for me my quarters were about a half mile from the sterco
 station at the west end of the mine pit sometimes i slept in my office but since it was nearly
 directly under the tipple and was noisy and dusty when the mine worked night shifts most of the time i
 slept in my house mac often came up in the morning to help me cook and eat breakfast joe the
 mine boss came along too sometimes other meals i ate with the miners at the various cook shacks along the
 branch mile the author charles mckenzie ssas photographed s hen 50 had particularly good meals occasionally i he graduated from
 medical school in edmonton just ate at mile 38 with the mine boss there a fine before leaving for the
 coal branch in 1927 englishman whose wife was an excellent cook ukrainian woman in a cotton dress covered by while
 p a was away i made it a rule to visit a feather tick every camp at least once a
 week visit every i remembered dr delee s words don t em mine and eat meals with the miners barrass
 the woman so i gently eased the tick at mile 47 was an open pit mine the earth off her
 abdomen i again went over dr delee had been removed to a depth of about 20 feet questions exposing a
 bed of coal about three quarters of is the woman pregnant of that there was a mile long 220 feet
 wide and of unknown depth no doubt coal was mined by steam shovel and loaded on is she in labour
 again no doubt small cars that were pushed along by a donkey where is the head i laid both hands
 gently engine driven by a scot called donkey macon her abdomen to feel for the head donald the cars were
 pulled to the unloading suddenly she gave a grunt and said dere s platform and the coal dumped out onto
 a wide come baby belt beside the belt stood the slates men and she was correct the head was out
 and with boys who picked out the bones or slate and rock the next push i was able to catch
 the baby who from the coal as it went by the coal then went yelled loudly a boy to the
 top of the tipple where it was shunted down that was my first delivery one of several chutes into railway
 coal cars the simple isn t it i thought naively how coal was graded into various sizes lump coal was
 wrong i was i would find out only much later over eight inches in diameter nut coal was from the
 baby and the mother were fine we all had two to eight inches and pea coal was the smalle r
 3 pieces less then two inches across and the miners then began drilling holes and lay by 1927 mile 47
 had exhausted the west end ing more explosives of the pit to about the 200 feet depth but the east
 as the galleries grew larger they were braced end showed lots of coal yet at 300 feet there with timbers
 to hold up the roof till finally there was danger that the high banks might cave in and was very
 little coal left between rooms the supbury some of the men so a big dragline with a porting coal walls
 between rooms were called 100 foot boom and a half ton bucket was in the pillars the finale before closing
 off a gallery process of being installed with this system coal was the removal of the pillars it was a
 dangerous could be picked up the full width of the seam and job pulling pillars but a lucrative one and
 was down another 50 feet or more and then brought seen as a skill with high status slowly up to
 the tipple should the banks cave at the mines there were company men and in the most that would be
 lost was the bucket contract miners the company men moved the on the end of the dragline it was a
 cumbersome cars ran the tipple ran the hoist opened the affair and not as speedy as the steam shovels and
 galleries and laid the track they were paid by cas but it would be safer the hour orby the shift
 the contract miners were mile 48 had a smaller pit mine circular in considered the elite of the mining force
 and had shape coal was mined here by stea m shovel but to be highly experienced and skilled they dug
 since the pit was not as deep as at mile 47 there coa l drilled and blasted the galleries and
 shored seemed little chance of cave ins the colliery at the mines they were paid by the ton of coal
 mile 48 was run by a french canadian crew with mined at that time miners were receiving 1 00 a
 irish mine boss the bookkeeper was french per ton and it was a good miner who averaged canadian but spoke
 parisian french and i ten tons a day for specialized jobs like pulling learned a lot of conversational french from
 him pillars a miner might make 25 at that time mile 48 had the only beer license while i was
 there union organizers were aton the east arm of the branch so on saturday tempting to get the contract miners
 to accept a nights 48 became a melting pot of miners french daily wage the only colliery where the daily
 canadians from 48 yugoslavs from 50 swedes wage was accepted was at mile 37 output fell from 54 and scots
 and english from 47 there off there about 50 percent and the mine soon were no policemen on duty that
 i was aware of closed which may or may not be a commentary but other than a few simple fights
 there was no on daily wages and the psychology of work serious crime or disturbance even at mile 48 miners
 were the cleanest workers i had ever the coal branch produced mostly steam coal seen i had expected to see
 grimy men with dirty a good bituminous coal with low ash and faces walking down the streets but instead i
 saw moisture content that was used by the railroads only clean neatly dressed men coming home as fuel for their
 steam engines there were also from the mines the collieries on the branch prosmaller collieries on the branch that mined
 vided laundry services showers and lockers for domestic coal a poorer grade bituminous coal about 1 00 per month so
 no matter how dirty used for heating these were shaft mines and the miners got during their shift they could
 wash i went down into each mine several times dur from head to toe and step out fresh and well
 ing my stay they were all similar in operation dressed the main shaft followed the coal seam with when p
 a arrived home he suggested that i rooms or galleries off to each side each miner stay with him for
 the winter or at least until the was assigned a room in which he worked alone mines began to close
 down in early march minor with a partner in the rooms the miners drilled ing was a seasonal occupation with
 the demand holes and placed explosives just before the end for coal highest in the late summer when the of
 the shift all the miners went above ground steam engines needed coal to haul the farm proand the firing man
 went along the galleries and duce to market and in the winter when people shot off the explosives in all
 the rooms during needed coal to heat their homes and businesses the next shift the miners broke up the coal
 p a said i could live at coalspur and provide loosened by the explosives and let it run down medical
 care for the few people there and for the a chute from the room into small cars the shaft miners
 at miles 38 and 42 there was a house was at such a steep incline from 15 to 45 per
 available formerly occupied by the mine cent that there was little shovelling to do the superintendent at coalspur i had
 done well coal cars were pulled up an incline to the tipple financially on the coal branch my income had
 4 sterling collieries seen above was the location of dr mckenzie s office during his brief stay in the coal
 branch been from 500 to 800 per month and i had tendent s house and as i walked past the
 window paid back most of my debts and bought some new i saw him at the table eating dinner i
 had had clothes and medical supplies it seemed like a visions of him lying on the floor of the mine
 good deal so i decided to stay shaft 1 000 feet down all crushed solwas much the colliery at coalspur
 was no longer open relieved he was surprised to see me the it had become too expensive to mine moreover
 message had been garbled all he had asked was one of the mines had caught fire ten years earlier that
 i come down the next day on the train to look and was still burning even without the colliery at
 a few minor scratches coalspur held on to a certain former importance that was the coldest longest walk of my
 life as the rail centre for the branch it had a round nine miles at 40 below zero for a
 few scratches house and repair shop but the town was really i was reading in my house at coalspur one
 only a store and a post office my arrival in sunday when the tipple boss from mile 38 came creased
 the population by 25 percent to a grand in the door total of five the most unusual resident in coal

 not necessary to adverfoot and an underlying concern for the safety tise danger unless the alarm has a foundation for
 of the townspeople one can also perceive the immediate action to show fear when danger is apprehension political connivance boredom

 headquarters and he is now in comof war aboard the train the departure of the first munication with the minister
 of militia in detachment a couple of weeks ago did not attract reference to the organization general strange is as
 much attention as the one of tuesday last for an extensive rancher in this district he is also the news
 had become liberty and the fact that connected with the military colonization com ex president riel had commenced taking pany
 one of his sons mr henry strange is a prisoners showed the old timers here that he graduate of the
 military college and he will probmeant to be in earnest ably be elected a lieutenant of the corps naturally the
 withdrawal of all but half a a good deal of sympathy for the half breed dozen wounded policemen from this
 post has had cause exists among the white settlers of course the effect of creating some alarm because the bloodshed
 will raise a new issue and in the bitteraverage blackfoot or blood is not like your ness of the strife
 the original dispute will become incapable chippewa here you have the real secondary indian though in saying this i do
 not wish it to march 29 the greatest possible excitement be understood that the adjective is to imply that prevailed
 here this evening owing to a report that the ex president of the provincial government the blackfeet were moving on
 calgar y the louis rielj has any particular control over the rumor originated partly from a dispatch from natural enemies
 of the cree but there has been langdon stating that large bands of blackfeet and there is still a scare
 in calgary partly from were seen passing there and moving westward the fact that at no time are the blackfeet
 or bloods father lacombe has gone east to the blackfoot to be trusted too much reserve they have no especial
 grievance on hand and april 1 rev father lacombe returned last i am certain they have as little sympathy for
 the night by special train from the blackfoot cross riel movement as they have for the edicts of mr ing
 he was met at the station by a large number george purvis but what they are trying to get of
 citizens all anxious to hear what he had to through their craniums just now is what have say as soon
 as he got off he informed the mayor the police gone away for said one of these and crowd that
 the blackfeet indians were all r ascals to me the other day red coats gone quiet and that there was
 no danger he informed injun run the country now the english was me this morning that he had telegraphed sir

 idea was ex april 3 some of our good friends are taking pressed to a hardware merchant yesterday advantage of

 has no foolish notions like many of our canapressed for the half breeds now in insurrection dian braves that one
 may meet in the eastern against the government there is a strong under provinces especially around ottawa current here against
 the government it has been fort calgary is not a fort in the sense that the worked up by certain
 parties who while profes word fort generally conveys it has no blockade sing to be friendly to the government are
 urging or bastions nor has it any walls the barracks on the dissidents while they themselves are comprise three frame
 buildings one storey high keeping in the background there is however compr ising mess room recreation and guard a strong
 loyal sentiment in this district and while rooms besides offices these buildings form on the first vie s of calgar
 seen h the arrising troops were the buildings ofl atlantic ninth avenue 9 three sides of the parade ground on
 the north v side are the stables which are composed of logs and the quarter master s stoe it is
 on a gentle rise which slopes towards the bow and elbow ‘ rivers the only two pieces of ordinance which
 the fort ever possessed were sent away to the front three or four weeks ago bluffs and cut banks extend
 to within 500 yards on the north and south of the fort on the top v of these bluffs an
 enemy might take up a position and pick off the people in the fort or at least annoy them so
 that they would have to hunt cover but a redoubt or two on each cut bank could be held against
 a strong force thus protecting the fort from the fire of sharpshooters but fort calgary could be easily protected in
 case of emergency the railway embankment on the south forms an excellent breastwork against an advancing force coming from that
 direction to the east and west are the elbow and bow rivers respectively to the west is the town fort
 calgary is however never likely to be attacked unless it is by the stupidity jealousy and want ‘ ‘ j
 v of good sense on the part of a few of its citizens ‘ who are sighing for excitement and
 notoriety it is as safe from an indian or half breed attack as the peak of teneriff or the devil

 the river pilot was when the great river steamer pulled away on its named slim behn a very good river
 man and long journey down river to aklavik where it father of the present indian chief at fort nelson would
 empty the last of its supplies and begin georgie behn there were three posts on the the slow return journey
 upstream stopping at river fort liard nelson forks and fort nelson each post to collect the bales of fur which
 would that is of course the old trading settlement and eventually reach london not the present fort nelson on the
 alaska high this was 1928 and fur was the economic life way which only came into being when the of
 the whole north a vast area indeed fort simp highway was built in 1942 son which was named after one
 of the early i was thrilled to be at last heading up this river governors of the company sir george
 simpson of my dreams the swift liard its name is a was one of the largest and most important of
 the french canadian word meaning poplar but 250 trading posts they operated throughout is often mispronounced as if it was
 spelled canada laird there are great stands of poplar along the buildings composed of a store a large the river
 as well as birch and coniferous forests warehouse and a two storey dwelling house too were built of massive squared
 timbers you could about 15 miles up river from fort simpson buy almost anything needed in the north here there
 is a set of fairly difficult rapids and fast and there were vast quantities of merchandise water which extends for
 about 20 miles with three the upper storey of the house had gun emplace main areas of rapids it was
 necessary for all deck ments probably never used though hands and passengers to help pull on tow lines there were
 many indians slaveys a tribe of to get the boat through the fast water passengers the tinneh dené 0:dene people somewhere
 around included company personnel and trappers head 200 or 300 hunters also about 15 or 20 white ing for their
 espective taplines trappers lived in the vicinity the hbc factor was i decided to stay at fort liard which is
 a most named fred camsell his brother charles picturesque place and a good fur post though became a doctor and
 the charles camsell much smaller than fort simpson the hbc hospital in edmonton was named after him both dominated as
 usual there was a small nt post he camsells were born in fort liard where their but it was insignificant
 and a catholic mission father had been company factor run by the oblate fathers a few native huts and besides
 the hbc there was another company that was fort liard the indians were slaveys called northern traders from winnipeg the
 same as fort simpson and spoke no english nt as it was known operated about a dozen i put in
 the winter helping around the hbc as posts along the mackenzie and liard rivers of needed such as cutting wood
 etc and trapping which only the posts at fort simpson and aklavik up the black river ca lled pettitot on
 the map were of any size then there was a mounted being pretty green to the life i didn t
 make any police detachment under inspector moorhouse fortune but managed to get by and thoroughly with three constables and a
 relatively recent enjoyed myself advent in the north a wireless station operated spring came and the river broke sometime by
 the royal canadian corps of signals rccs later there came a river scow from fort nelson under lt hastings a
 government doctor named heading for fort simpson with some company dr truesdell and the indian agent flin harris personnel and
 natives aboard also a white trapa brother irishman but flin had a bullet head and per named ike gunnell with
 his winter catch cross eyes which i didn t there was a small gunnell had homesteaded around fort st john
 stopping place for bed and meals run by an ex about 1920 but abandoned his place and went trapper named
 andy whittington it is of interest trapping north of fort nelson to note that andy issued brass tokens stamped i
 decided to join the crew at their invitation whittington 50 or whittington 1 which and we pushed on down river
 camping out each were accepted as legal tender in the settlement night these river scows were good big boats i
 ve often regretted that i never hung onto any easily built of whipsawed lumber flat bottomed of these tokens as
 souvenirs with high flared sides and steered by means of 20 when the author set out for fort liard he
 travelled on the small tug liard river seen in the foreground in 1930 a sweep or oar set in a
 notch in the stern and at the offer with a bow sweep to manoeuver as needed there gunnell sold his
 catch for about 5 000 which was no engine and the boat just drifted along in was a lot of
 money in those days and we set the fast current about making plans for the trip i didn t have
 on the third day after leaving fort liard we much money left but lots of ambition were approaching the rapids
 and a native was at that summer we built a river boat out of whipthe steering sweep i could hear
 the roar of the sawed lumber about 30 feet long by six feet wide rapids ahead and uneasily noted that
 we were out on the bottom and good high flared sides we pretty far in the river suddenly gunnell who
 decked in about eight or 10 feet in front made was a good riverman must have realized the two narrow
 sleeping bunks and a light frame to same thing for he jumped up pushed the indian pull a tent over
 if weather turned bad and to sleep off the sweep and yelled for someone to get the under at night
 we had a small wood burning bow sweep going no one moved so i jumped stove for cooking and warmth
 we bought eight over some of the men lying in the bottom of the dogs which we kept chained on
 deck when boat and swung the bow sweep out with gun travelling dog harnesses two mackenzie river nell yelling instructions
 we managed to work the toboggans with high curled heads traps a good scow closer to shore out of the
 huge rollers that grubstake and a johnson outboard motor or as occur when the river is high we shipped some
 it s generally called a kicker gunnell insisted water but nothing serious and gunnell and i on fastening it on
 the stern so it wouldn t steer stayed in charge of the scow until we reached he preferred a steering
 sweep in case the engine fort simpson quit at the wrong time we would still be able to this little
 episode changed my life in an un control the boat as it turned out this was a wise expected way
 after landing gunnell came up precaution to me and said how pleased he was at my prompt we sailed from
 fort simpson on my 19 th birthaction in the rapids he then told me how he was day aug 22
 1929 and headed down our river planning to head for the mackenzie delta where of destiny i can t tell
 you how thrilling it was he heard there was very good trapping and asked to me heading into the unknown
 days slipped me if i would like to join him in this venture by and the scenery ever changing was
 like a he was a lot older than me being about 60 while golden dream especially the far off mountains
 i was still in my late teens but he had something in the west which would come into view and
 that i lacked which was experience so i jumped then be lost again as the river bends took us 21
 we stopped briefly at wrigley trading post to this immense reservoir is about 3 500 to 4 000 ask about
 the river ahead and after that fort sq miles and is approximately 125 miles long norman which was an important
 post fort by 35 to 40 miles wide on the average there norman is located at the mouth of the
 bear river are three main channels that empty into the where great bear lake empties its clear waters beaufort sea
 on the west is the peel channel into the muddy mackenzie the water remains called that because the peel river
 flowing from separated for at least 100 miles down stream the the mackenzie mountains past fort mcpherson hb manager or
 factor was named macalpine empties into the river below point separation we learned that about 10 or 12 miles above
 fort akiavik the trading centre was located on the good hope the river narrowed and ran through peel channel about
 60 miles below point a sort of canyon called the ramparts being high separation rock walls they told us that
 at a low water stage the main branch called the middle river such as now in later summer there is
 a reef which averages about two miles in width the east runs across the river just before entering the branch
 follows along the low hilly contours of ramparts and it can be troublesome they ad the eastern barrens it was
 on the east branch vised us to hug the right hand shore rather than that we chose to locate and
 we found a spot that try to shoot the steamboat channel in the middle was suitable for a building site
 about 70 miles of the river as this would be rough from point separation just a short distance below so
 we followed this advice but it was a the site of present day inuvik which of course mistake nearing the
 ramparts we saw that we did not exist in those days were going to be swept over a drop of
 five or after building our cabin we mapped out our six feet but we could do nothing about it then
 proposed trapline to a little round island called over we went and shot through a big curled back tununuk approximately
 50 miles down river wave which almost swamped our boat it came and we began preparing for winter right across
 the deck over the scared dogs and i won t bore you with life in the arctic except put about
 two feet of water in the boat not only to say that an eskimo family living over on the that
 but the kicker struck the reef breaking the main channel invited me to stay with them so shearpin and had
 it not been for gunnell s pre as i could learn the ways of existing in that harsh caution in
 using a sweep for steering we would climate such as setting fish nets under the ice have capsized or been
 smashed on the rocks he to get dog feed and of how to set out taps on managed to guide
 us through to quieter waters the wind swept rivers and lakes i stayed with and with the help of some
 indians who saw we them off and on most of the winter and they prowere in trouble we landed our
 soggy boat at fort vided me with caribou parka pants boots and good hope where the hb factor gaston mitts
 of which there is nothing warmer of herodier made us welcome and we stayed there course i kept in touch
 with my partner ike guntwo days drying out our outfit mr herodier was nell and between us we got a
 pretty fair catch a fine man and i was sorry to hear the next year of fur that he had
 been killed by an exploding gasoline in spring that is late may and early june we lamp which he was
 trying to light launched our boat and worked across the delta we left fort good hope on sept 1 st
 and about toward aklavik hunting muskrats as we went 25 miles down stream we crossed the arctic the delta is
 a network of small lakes and creeks circle farther down river we stopped at a trap and in high water
 you can take a boat almost anyper s place at the mouth of the travaillant river where it is a
 haven for waterfowl ducks geese his name was clark and it is interesting to note and swans as well as
 myriads of small waders that he was able to raise a good garden that far and other birds as the
 season advances mosnorth of the circle we bought some cabbages quitoes and later on blackflies become a real pest carrots
 and potatoes from him and these were shortly after the first of june the midnight sun to be the last
 fresh vegetables i would taste for appears and the delta receives 24 hour sunshine the next five years for nearly
 a month of course there is a cor we stopped overnight at arctic red river post responding absence of sunshine
 in december and and bought some supplies to replace those we had early january used or lost as a result
 of water damage next aklavik the metropolis of the north at that day we reached point separation where the time
 was built on a jutting point of the peel mackenzie river splits to form its great delta channel the ground
 is river silt permafrost this 22 this was the home cabin of the author fifteen miles downriver from aklavik when
 this picture was taken in june 1933 the ice had just broken in the river very important post served the
 mackenzie delta the hbc manager or factor was named jack as well as the whole western arctic to about parsons
 a very good trader there was a saying coronation gulf where the coppermine river among trappers that the trappers skinned
 the pelts empties the hbc dominated the trade of and the hbc skinned the trappers however this course and aldavik
 was certainly another of their was more in fun than for real actually the commajor trading posts most of the
 fur from the pany was pretty fair with us and even through delta compr ised coloured foxes being reds the
 1930 s fur prices held reasonably well plus crosses silvers and the rare blacks these being there was lots of
 fur another thing i ll say for all of one species and the different markings the company i know of
 no case when anyone might all be found in a single litter white foxes native or white was refused credit
 or jaware a smaller animal of a different species and bone as it was called they might hold a perdo
 not interbr eed with the larger coloured foxes son down to essentials however they were only occasionally found in the
 delta the nt also maintained a post hee the preferring the barren lands and the arctic coast manager being pat
 quinn it was a pretty good mink were at times plentiful and so were lynxes store too though not nearly
 as big as the bay because of the great numbers of snowshoe rabbits the mounted police detachment was under that
 lived in the willow thickets these rabbits inspector eames with four constables eames also formed lunch for the foxes as
 well as snowy was the man who a few years later led the posse owls that shot and killed the
 mad trapper albert no discussion of the mackenzie delta would johnson he was a good policeman and widely be complete
 without mentioning the vast caribou respected the wireless station was under lt migrations that used to arrive each fall from
 the nash neary there was an anglican mission in middle of september through october they charge of the rev mr
 murray and its small but always stayed to the west of the delta where the good hospital adjunct the nurse
 being a miss barrens or tundra stretched into the distant bradford dr urquhart was the medico and a mountains of
 the yukon they must have good doctor he was the catholic mission was numbered in excess of 100 000 animals
 because headed by father benami an oblate priest and as far as you could see there were moving they had
 a large school and dormitory for native caribou getting winter s meat supply was as children a place to get
 bed and meals was run easy as shooting cows in a farmer s yard because by an ex trapper named
 vincent kent and his when they are on migration they don t spook wife there were also the usual run
 of native easily shacks 23 at christmas time most of the white trappers only one i ever saw which was
 said to have been of which there were about 20 would gather in used to execute two eskimos for the
 murder of the settlement to sell their furs and visit many a catholic priest over on the coppermine river natives
 both eskimo from the lower delta and after our second winter my partner ike gun indians from the upper part
 would also show up nell was forced to leave the north owing to so that there might be upwards of
 300 dogs tied declining health he went out to vancouver and around the perimeter of the settlement boy oh died
 a couple of years later i remained on trapboy they would set up an unholy howling at ping another five
 years but then an opportunity night making it just about impossible to sleep arose to take over the small northern
 traders at easter time also provided another get together fort liard so i decided to leave the arctic and and
 most of the trappers who were mainly loners head back to the place where i had spent my first and
 who might go weeks or a month without see winter ing anyone else usually looked forward to these i reached
 fort liard in july 1936 where i gatherings traded and trapped for the following two years again about the middle
 of june most of the up to this point the hbc had dominated this people would gather in aklavik to
 sell their great almost empty land which stretched so far muskrats a good muskrat hunt would mean yet was confined
 to trading centres located anywhere from 1 000 to 2 000 rats and we mainly on rivers boats in summerand
 dog sleds received during the seven years i remained in the in winter were the main means of travel but
 in delta an average of perhaps 75 cents apiece the late 1930 s forces were in motion that were some
 years lower and some higher muskrats ac to change all that insignificant at first but growcounted for 750 to 1
 500 of a trapper s income ing ever more important each year was the air foxes and other pelts might
 bring another 2 000 plane and in some cases a lot more in the late 1920 s and through the
 1930 s there about the first of july we would begin expect were some individual spectacular flights by pilots ing
 the first steamer of the summer the other whose names shine punch dickens wop came in late august we would
 gather on the may walter gilbert stan mcmillan and others bank of the river after the indians would tell us
 but these were special missions then a hesitant the boat was coming i never found out how they monthly mail
 service between edmonton and knew but they probably had some way of signal aklavik was inaugurated in the early 1930
 s ling from up river after the boat had passed arctic which depended on open water in summer and red
 river the arrival was a time of feasting frozen areas in winter it was a beginning that such as buying
 a case of eggs and boiling the would not only free transportation from its riverwhole thing in a tub each
 trapper putting up part bound hold but would bring into being new of the money in muskrats also our paternal
 economic factors that would change the north for officials in the northwest territories government good or for bad there would
 be new types at fort smith allowed each white person to order trained prospectors mining engineers petroleum up to 12
 quarts of hard liquor each year this experts and ot hers who would be looking for the could be lemon
 hart rum the favorite or mineral wealth that lay buried underneath the scotch ye brandy or a mixture of any
 of them traplines natives were not allowed to have liquor the and my own life was soon to change too
 in orders called liquor permits had to be sent in march 1938 late one afternoon a small skiplane the previous
 year for future delivery of course landed near my place on the liard the pilot said the whiskey had to
 last all year so there were he was running short of time to reach fort simpno serious wild partyings but
 gentle fun never son and asked if he could stay overnight with me theless i said i d be glad
 of the company he told me i think it was the second year i was there i got his name
 was mcconachie and that he ran a small a chance to visit herschel island about 175 miles bush service out
 of edmonton called united air north west of akiavik in the beaufort sea this transport the names meant nothing to
 me at the was originally a whaling station before the arctic time but of course this was none other than
 grant whales were almost hunted to extinction in the mcconachie who in a few short years was to harvour is
 an old graveyard with some of the become a giant in canadian aviation he founder whalers names still decipherable dating
 from of canadian pacific air lines the middle 1880 s also there was a gallows the that evening as we
 chatted he spotted a home 24 to celebrate easter in 1932 the author 6 th from right joined other trappers
 at kost s place in aklavik made radio transmitter that i had built out of an friends and relatives wanted
 to hear what the old discarded receiver and a moonshine still that prodigal son had to say but the bright
 lights my predecessor had left behind i had got the didn t look any better after 10 years than they
 plans out of a tattered radio amateurs hand had before so after christmas was over i made book the thing
 worked okay and i used to ham plans to head north again i thought i d see it up in
 morse code with a hb ham at fort mcconachie first and if that deal had fallen nelson this intrigued mcconachie
 and he asked through then i would make my way back to the me if i would be at all
 interested in joining his mackenzie delta company he went on to say that he was trying i took the train
 to edmonton and found to nail down a contract from the post office to mcconachie he was delighted and wanted
 me fly mail from edmonton to whitehorse how to leave right away for watson lake he said he ever they
 were insisting on a radio and weather had sent in a man already but doubted if he inreporting station and
 appropriate landing site tended to stay i got a ride to fort nelson on the somewhee midway between fort nelson
 and little mail plane that used to go there every two whitehorse since the present jump was con weeks i
 then had to make a quick trip to fort sidered too far for safety he said there was an liard
 for some personal things so i borrowed ideal lake in the yukon where a trapper named a dog team from
 a trapper i knew and was back frank watson lived a location tentatively called to fort nelson in 10 days
 with my whipsaw watson lake he would like me to go in there broadaxe and sundry other items pilot ralph
 put up a station and operate it oakes picked me up and landed me at watson i was aware that
 the northern traders were lake in early february 1939 where frank planning to sell their posts to the hudson s
 bay watson and a big fellow named vic johnson met so i indicated interest however i wouldn t be the
 plane frank and vic had already got out a able to take on this job until early 1939 as i
 set of building logs and had pretty well completed would have to dispose of the trading posts s stock the
 station which helped consider ably if they did sell out then i wanted to go home the company had sent
 in radio equipment a to winnipeg and see my paents aga in after being short wave transmitter and receiver together
 with gone 10 years so we let the matter slide storage batteries and a gasoline motor generator the northern traders
 did sell out and i remain and the dominion weather service had sent in ed until late summer at liard
 and then made my weather equipment including a recording way home to winnipeg arriving in the fall of anemometer barometers
 thermometers rain 1938 naturally there was a great reunion all our gauge cloud atlas etc 25 frank died soon after
 and vic only stayed with me until we had got out some more building logs made some lumber with the
 whipsaw and built two more buildings then he went prospecting and i was alone part of my duties required me
 to send out three synoptic weather reports daily one at 4 00 in the morning one at 11 00 and
 one at 4 00 in the afternoon these meant taking cloud observations as to type estimated height and direction of
 movement barometer readings together with their tendencies as rising falling steady etc maximum and minimum temperatures surface wind precipitation etc
 coding all this into numerical groups from a code book and then sending to the wireless station at either fort
 simpson or whitehorse for relay to toronto besides this i had other daily radio skeds plus the general work at
 the station the company had meanwhile changed its name from united air transport to yukon southern air transport had bought
 some new twin engine aircraft and increased its service from edmonton and vancouver to whitehorse war in europe had been
 declared and this had an effect too the result of all this was that i could scarcely keep up with
 the work and i badgered mcconachie to send me some assistance in late ‘ i he author jack baker is
 seen here at the radio shack summer a young man named gordon stock he built at watson lake in 1939
 arrived to be my helper gordon had little expe guide my hand across the 500 miles he advised rience but
 he was a willing worker and was able me to provide myself with a razor blade broken to take over
 the outside work such as cutting diagonally to give a piercing as well as a cutting firewood and tending planes
 when they stopped edge and to boil it to sterilize it to have clean in so we kept things running
 okay at watson cloths and hot water for mopping blood by early november the lake was freezing over that night
 other radios in our circuit cleared and we could expect some reprieve from work the air to allow an open
 channel and conditions gordon began experiencing a bad headache were excellent so that we could use microphones which i tried
 to relieve with aspirins but they instead of the usual morse key i led gordon indid no good as the
 days passed his face began to the shack and sat him down he was pretty to swell and one eye
 was closed completely far gone and there was no need to tie him in the there was no way a
 plane could land so when chair as the doctor had suggested i was pretty it became obvious that the affliction
 was getting shakey as dr kearny gave me instructions where worse and gordon could neither eat nor sleep to start
 cutting and how deep i might have to go i called our operator at charlie lake where our so i
 began poking the po inted instrument into the fort st john base was located at red powell s area around
 gordon s eye blood flowed place and asked him if he could locate a doctor gordon winced and moaned and
 i was scared and find out what i could do if anything later but it was a comfort to know
 that the doctor was our operator called back to say that dr kearny as near as my microphone it took
 a while but said i would have to do an immediate operation eventually i cut through to the seat of
 the trouble to relieve the pressure which was obviously fore and it burst out of his head and that was
 a relief ing its way into some delicate area back of his gordon immediately went limp in a faint the
 eye and could result in death if not relieved he doctor said to lay him out on a mattress on
 the agreed to attend at the radio station at charlie floor so the incision could continue draining lake that night
 at 8 00 o clock when communi cover him up and keep him warm and hope for cations were expected
 to be at their best and the best 26 i cleaned up around the operating room and behind him formed
 canadian pacific air lines went to bed exhausted i checked gordon at 4 00 out of several small bush lines
 of which yukon a m when i took my weather observation and southern was the nucleus i was promoted to
 he had not moved but i satisfied myself he was chief despatcher of northern lines based at breathing okay and
 his pulse was steady he whitehorse by this time of course the governdidn t wake until well on next afternoon
 and his ment was building airports including one at first words were i m hungry music to my watson and
 installing their own radio and ears indeed so i helped him up washed his face weather stations and fed him
 some soup he had no memory of i was married by this time and we lived at his ordeal or
 even of several days before it days whitehorse for the next four years but my old passed and finally i
 was able to get a small plane wandering spirit chafed at cpr type regulations in and send gordon out to
 fort st john where paperwork and reports and uniforms so i left the dr kearny looked him over and said
 there was company and went back to the trapline this time nothing else needed to be done to the peace
 river country at gold bar my i never saw gordon again for 30 years when he father in law s
 ranch i trapped for the next two visited me one day in my office in fort st john winters in
 the mountains and the graham river we had a great reunion the little scar was but i was only trying
 to turn the hands of the scarcely visible and the trouble had never clock back i realized that it wasn
 t much of a recurred life for a family man so in the summer of 1948 in 1942 grant mcconachie
 with cpr money we finally moved to fort st john hot springs a short account of this place might be
 interesting to your readers and i will try and give them a true account of them banff station is situated
 14 miles west of canmore the divisional terminus of the prairie division of the cpr and 60 miles west of
 calgar y in the heart of the rocky mountains the hot springs are situated five miles southwest of the station
 about 3 000 feet higher than the level of the bow river the dominion government under the superintendency of mr
 stewart d l s have built a very good wagon road from the station to the springs and made a
 good floating bridge over the bow and teams can now drive right to the springs the road is a most
 beautiful drive and the grade in no instance more than one foot in forty and winds round the mountains through
 dense forests of spruce and pine mr moulton at one time a resident of your town has built a number
 of log shanties and erected a number of tents which he designates a hotel and where the traveler and visitor
 can procure a very fair meal his establishment is on the north side of the bow and about two miles
 from the station dr brett of winnipeg is engaged in the erection of a large hotel on the south side
 of the bow in a beautiful location overlooking the river and about one mile from the falls where the water
 has a straight fall of 45 feet besides these two places there are two other hotels situated at the springs
 the baths are well patronized and it is really wonderful the curative powers they contain the water is very hot
 the strongest man can only remain in it about ten minutes they are a sovereign remedy for rheumatism neuralgia and
 all manner of nervous and blood disorders there is an omnibus line running between the station and the springs and
 one of their vehicles meet every train the passenger tariff is only 1 which is considered very cheap here regina
