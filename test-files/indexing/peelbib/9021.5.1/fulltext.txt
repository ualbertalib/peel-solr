 pioneer s impressions and recollections part i by richard gavin reid i was one of a good sized family born
 that i finally decided to go to canada and reared in a southern suburb of the was almost an accident
 i am quite sure city of glasgow my parents came i would have returned to south africa to glasgow from
 rural aberdeenshire had it not been for the unsettled condiwhere we had numerous relatives and tions there following the war
 progress where we as children usually spent lengthy summer school holidays for the most part we were educated in public
 schools at a time when the scottish system of education was recognized as in the forefront in this field the
 results achieved under that system were in my opinion quite up to the present day standards what the curriculum may
 have lacked in variety may have been compensated for by the thoroughness applied to the instruction in the somewhat narrower
 field after a few years in employment in business with the outbreak of the south african war in the fall
 of 1899 i found myself early in the next year on my way to cape town as a member of
 the royal army medical corps two years of this service proved to be valuable and interesting but also without doubt
 provided my first inoculation of the virus wanderlust on my return to the old land with my military service terminated
 i found myself with a settled conviction that it would not be long till i would once more have to
 answer an impelling urge to strike out for a less crowded environ was almost at a standstill for several merit
 the great open spaces had got years south africa being out of conme the notices that one meets on every
 sideration there was little difficulty in hand in britain such as please keep selecting western canada as the most the
 grass and trespassers will be desirable of the remaining locations prosecuted were an offence to the ele available ment of
 insurgency that lies within the consciousness of every scot it may be and so i set sail for montreal about
 near the surface or deep seated or may the middle of june 1903 with me was he dormant for a
 time but it is always a lad i had gone to school with he around somewhere had a younger brother
 who in company this is the first of two articles by richard gavin reid who is a former premier of
 alberta after coming to the province in 1904 mr reid settled in the vermilion district he was elected for that
 constituency in 1921 the year the u f a party came into power and received the dual portfolios of municipal
 affairs and health he became provincial treasurer in 1923 and served as premier in 1934 and 1935 mr reid is
 now librarian for canadian utilities ltd in edmonton with a friend of his had preceded us on sented by the
 occasional urban settlethe westward trek by more than a month ments we passed from time to time no they had
 gone to the killarney district matter how small they might be each in southern manitoba and were em had its
 church and these churches for ployed there on farms in that area my the most part appeared large ambitious friend
 and i therefore had killarney as structures by comparison with the surour first objective rounding rural settlement homes clustered around
 the churches were the i soon found that we four had one homes real homes surrounded by their thing in
 common and that was that each flower and vegetable gardens and of us was acting as a pathfinder for his
 sheltered from the winds by many trees family who in every instance had every and shrubs all in all the
 picture they intention of following us provided only presented externally at least was that that we were able to recommended
 this of a succession of ideal communities none course of action of them big enough to have reached the point
 where community of interest be from our various studies of immigra comes displaced by the family isolation literature which by
 the way dis tionisni found in larger centres played no tendency to underestimate the agricultural potentialities of the while montreal
 was our final destinawestern prairies the edmonton area tion the ship stopped at quebec for seemed to be the one
 which beckoned about four hours and thus gave us an most forcefully first however we the opportunity to make our
 first contact forerunners were to spend our first sum with french canada and some of its mer as hired men
 on farms so that we people our immediate reaction was could get some farm experience and that here was an
 old city in a new land absorb as thoroughly as possible the remote in many ways from the influence background
 of this new environment of the expanding canadian economy outside of its own provincial boundaries the first leg of our
 journey the trans for the first time we sensed the isolaatlantic involved nothing in the nature tionism of quebec from
 the rest of of difficulty or hardship the allen liner canada and the british empire as it ss athenia carried
 us from glasgow to then was montreal our first glimpse of canada in the gulf of st lawrence found us
 on the last leg of the trip from quebec wide open for reception of first impres to montreal it being
 the 1 st of july we sions of this new land naturally we had our first introduction to canada s
 were impressed with its natural beauty national holiday dominion day even but frankly we were more interested in on the
 river we had many evidences of such evidence as could be seen of what the celebrations incidental to that day
 had been accomplished by man in the in the passing stern wheeler and excurdevelopment of this still comparatively sion ships
 loaded to capacity with holiyoung country the farm homes were day makers practically all storey and a half frame buildings
 with little or no departure from montreal differed in many ways from the severest and most strictly utilitarian quebec still
 with a strong frencho itlines and these were surrounded by canadian background it was a thriving farm yards where the
 minimum of beau growing metropolitan city much more tification had been resorted to as a set cosmopolitan in its outlook
 ting for the home the river lot surveys from montreal westward we saw for abutting on the river front had
 the desir a time farm homes not too far removed able feature of bringing the homes closer in circumstances and
 conditions from the together than is customarily found in the farm scene in the older lands from which west where
 the units of subdivision the we came there was one marked diisection or the quarter section form true ference however
 agricultural developsquares in contrast to the long sided ment was often contiguous to and cerparallelograms characteristic of the river tainly
 never far distant from the forest lot primeval the early settlers in these in sharp contrast o the drabness of
 areas were fortunate in this respect that this rural scene was the picture pre unlimited supplies of building material and
 fuel were available practically at proceeding westward this farm area their door steps without cost other than was gradually left
 behind to be suctheir own man power they brought to ceeded by a terrain of forests and lakes the task
 with little or no evidence of lumbering operations till approaching the western while this timber was a blessing in limits
 of lake superior from here on the ways i have mentioned in other and through the lake of the woods
 respects it was regarded by the settlers country extensive timber operations as almost a curse particularly where were in evidence
 but neither agriculture the farms had to be carved out of the nor the mining activities that was to solid
 bush even in these present days develop at a later date with the power now available to us such as
 tractors and bulldozers this could winnipeg which we reached on the still be a costly task of almost stu fourth
 day from montreal was like a pendous proportions but not having young giant striving and constantly these latter day facilities
 and having to gaining strength to meet the task that depend solely on their own efforts sup had been thrust
 on it by the accident plemented by such simple tools as the of its geographic location this responsiaxe and the
 grub hoe the subjugation bility was selling and handling the conof these areas their change to produc stantly increasing flow
 of golden grain tive farm homes must stand as one of from the virgin prairie lands being the outstanding triumphs
 of man over brought under production by the steady nature in our canadian history not only flow of new settlers
 does canada owe a debt of gratitude to what interested us however was that these pioneers who accomplished what it
 was the jumping off place for our first they did through their qualities of thrift objective killarney where we hoped
 to and industry carried often to the limits get some farm experience in preparation of human endurance but while doing
 icr the time when we as homesteaders this they raised large families fully would face the task of carving out
 farm endowed with these same characteristics homes for ourselves there was no dearth who in many instances in later years
 of opportunities even for greenhorns at went forth to leave indelible impressions established rates of pay experienced on the pattern
 of areas of subsequent hired men were getting about 25 per development as they were opened up to month with
 board but for our class settlement many of these found their greenhorns the rate was 10 monthly new outlets on
 the prairies not much money but the important con at the time of mr reid s arrival in western canada
 this was the general method of harvesti this photo is from the ernest brown collection of the alberta government sideration
 was the opportunity for ex agencies in a very short time we had perience to get that chance and some
 visited them all and i was never so money to boot was all to the good from thoroughly deflated in
 my life we were our point of view turned down cold definitely and speedily the farm i was placed on
 was about four and a half miles south of killarney back to the hotel for a skull session in southern
 manitoba a half section in to see if we could possibly figure out extent and it had been first settled
 why this had happened to us it did on almost twenty years previously not take us long to find the
 nigger in generally speaking the farmers in my the wood pile when we left killarney opinion got good value for
 their 10 we had got into our city clothes and monthly investment but i sometimes this was the way we
 were clad when wondered at the time if they did not get we were trying to get employment in additional
 value from us in the amuse the woods walking down main street ment we provided through our inept there was
 little doubt we had all the approach to what to them were common earmarks of the greenest type of greeneveryday
 tasks or operations horn the solution therefore was to dress in old even disreputable clothes haying harvesting threshing fol and
 try once more lowed in rapid progression each of these tasks by the standards then obtaining this time we were
 successful being on the prairies competent to separate signed up for the winter with the pigeon the men from the
 boys if you had the lumber company in one of their camps stamina and perserverence that made it situated about
 thirty miles up this interpossible to measure up to these stan national boundary river from its mouth dards then you
 were one of the men on lake superior though it was not always easy i made the grade although i
 must confess that that winter experience was a story in at times i had to put up a false front
 itself that i do not propose to recount of confidence i did not always feel in too great detail suffice
 it to say it was a rewarding experience in spite with winter approaching the question of it being at times
 a tough one now was what should we do during generally speaking the food was good that period work could
 be had by and there was lots of it if at times the greenhorns on farms but usually they cooking
 left something to be desired it got no pay only board there was little was scarcely noticed as the immense
 actual work on the average manitoba appetites we developed made us much farm at that season except chores more appreciative
 of quantity than chores not being profitable as a source quality of experience and with the absence of in these
 early days hours of labour pay days as another discouraging factor we considered alternatives or per as a result of
 government regulationhaps i should say the only alternative or coming from later trades union movethat being the lumber woods for
 that ments was not even dreamt of as a type of work real wages were paid possibility in the lumber
 woods we 25 to 35 per month so all these things were in the woods before daylight ready being considered
 the die was cast we to start as soon as there was enough were for the time being going to
 be visibility for us to swing our axes a lumberjacks short respite at noon to eat lunch in the open
 and from then on till darkness with the advent of november we made made it impossible to work any longer
 our way back to winnipeg for it was for six days a week this was the routine there that most
 of the hiring was done and while we had lots of 40 degrees for this type of winter operation there
 below zero weather and occasional were three employment agencies in the storms the work went on uninterrupted city being before
 the days of govern from this or any other cause all winter ment agencies of this nature these were long
 privately owned and operated living conditions were primitive al with all the confidence in the world though probably about average
 of those we started round the circuit of these then existing the camps where we slept each accommodated about sixty
 men them as these plans were made on the double decker bunks holding two men assumption that the woods operations
 at each level extended along both sides would be over at about the date they and one end of the
 log building the usually were completed and as it beother end was the front of the camp with came apparent
 there would be a delay its only door and a couple of windows on this particular year of about ten
 days these again being the only windows in one of us had to leave the camp before it the building
 furnishings were at an closed so that the second contingent irreducible minimum deacon benches could be met in order that
 there would hewn from logs extending all the way be no delay in our settlement plans around in front of
 the bunks took care of the seating requirements for wash when the other three of us arrived at ing under
 the windows there was a edmonton we found that most of the shelf with three wash basins you dip advance
 party had left on a land hunt ped out your own water supply from one several days before fortunately under
 barrel and when it had served its pur the guidance of a competent land guide pose you emptied your basin
 into an this left us with almost a week to wait other the heating needs were taken for their return
 naturally we were care of amply by a heater stove big anxious to get into action but in early enough
 to take in four foot cordwood may as it was it was a welcome rest and lengths of logs for
 sleeping the men far from uninteresting giving us an furnished their own blankets but to opportunity to absorb our new

 commonly called lice and our camp was the market square was a hive of no exception two courses were open
 to activity in this connection instead of it you you could either let nature take its being used as it
 now is for a much needcourse or you could carry on an uninter ed parking place for cars it was
 then a rupted resistance to an invasion that was real farm produce market and prealways threatening when still in win
 dominant in this produce were the loads nipeg we had been warned by a casual of timothy hay from the
 neighbourhood acquaintance of this potential threat to farms this was one of the most profitour comfort he advised us to
 get some able crops in these days finding as it sapodilla powder and keep it sprinkled did ready sale at
 from 12 to 18 a ton in our bedding i can testify to the effec in contrast with oats the
 main crop tiveness of this treatment as it kept us where the farmers were doing well if free from these
 pests as long as the they got 25 cents a bushel sapodilla lasted unfortunately our some of the stores are
 still there supply ran out just about a week before although most of them have passed to the camp closed
 down and we then had other purposes predominant in the a demonstration of how helpless we places of business and
 none of these would have been without it are left were a number of blacksmith the work was finished and
 the camp shops repairing farm machinery and was closed about 2 o clock on a beauti vehicles was as could
 be expected an ful afternoon late in april we shouldered active part of their business but activiour packs and set
 out immediately on ties along another line more akin to the hike of about 25 miles to the railroad times
 and circumstances were at least track next day to fort william to be more noticeable you could seldom pass paid

 naturally the local interest in this an occasional condition that still plagues issue which was rather intense also us but
 at the time we are talking about stirred our imagination we were ap when the weather contributed to the conproached

 town and looking over the broad expanse of jasper avenue which by this during the campaign there came a time
 was an uninterrupted sea of liquid night when there were two meetings to mud as i watched i saw a
 four horse be held each of these to be addressed team approaching from the west and as by one of
 the two candidates in the field it came nearer i saw it was hitched to they being mr lessard conservative
 a road grader as the horses plodded and frank oliver liberal not being along it could be seen that their
 feet politically wise we thought the best sank in the mud at each successive step meeting would be at the
 largest audi clear up to their fetlocks and sometimes torium this being the thistle rink a little higher where mr
 lessard was to speak that is where we went the audience was to me this did not seem to be
 too neither large nor enthusiastic in sharp effective a method of dealing with the contrast to the rival gathering in
 the situation but it was at least encourag robertson hall where mr oliver had ing to realize that the municipality
 had his customary capacity audience and at a public works department that was which as usual he was able to

 restaurant the participants were one john bertrand otherwise the ‘ black kid and hank forbes formerly a detective employed by
 the stock association at macleod it appears that there was a scarcity of partners in the dance and forbes took
 umbrage at the kid who insisted on being ‘ on the floor every time approaching the gay kid forbes said
 ‘ you black you i want to do some of this dancing myself the epithet was answered by a blow
 which floored forbes who was more or less drunk the bystanders interfered and forbes left the place proceeding over town
 he secured a six shooter and returned entering the room he exposed the weapon and made for the kid who
 instantly dropped on his knees and tried to gain the door by crawling between forbes legs when in this position
 forbes fired twice in rapid succession the first bullet went through the kid s hat and grazing the scalp partially
 stunned the man the second shot pierced the floor in the excitement the kid recovering got outside forbes followed him
 and just as the kid was passing round the corner of the building brought him to earth with a shot
 which inflicted a slight wound in the side forbes walked up and fired again the ball this time cutting the
 sleeve and scratching the right forearm the attack was then abandoned and forbes shortly made himself scarce the kid is
 not dangerously wounded but his escape is almost a miracle forbes whereabouts are unknown the police are in search lethbridge
 news march 12 1886 a recent trip to edmonton from winnipeg almost a thousand miles accentuated for me by constant
 amazement at the endurance feats carried out by those generations of men of rupert s land called guides trippers or
 voyageurs we take our highways and moun tam passes so much for granted we have a smattering of knowledge concerning
 our big explorers and we so rarely consider the unknown or littleknown men who walked paddled or rowed this north
 west country into being this is part of the story of one of those men joe macdonald son of a
 hudson s bay company interpreter and steersman donald macdonald from brora scotland and his french wife janette beaudry after serving
 the company for thirty years at fort edmonton rocky mountain house and bow fort joe s father retired and took
 his land grant in the fur trade parish of saint andrew s on the red river in 1835 the year
 of joe s birth the boy s great uncles were john and donald mad mckay pedlars who joined the hudson
 s bay company in the 1780 s his cousins were john richards and the hon james mckay his neighbours and
 schoolmates all of the old fur trade school for whom the propensity to travel was almost as strong as the
 average human s need for food no wonder then that after his days at the local school were over and
 he had made small journeys with relatives he wished to sally forth on adventures of his own when he was
 twenty he went off on his first real job with john rowand junior son of chief factor john rowand of
 edmonton to bring to red river some cattle which the old fur trader had left at edmonton their route was
 via gull lake and fort carlton after a four day stay at edmonton they rounded up the cattle and drove
 them over the prairies joe macdonald and his wife the former miss margaret fraser daughter of coliia fraser of the
 hudson s bay company to red river this was the beginning of his treks which roughly calculated amount to a
 total of about 45 000 miles mainly by foot with dog teams or red river carts sometimes by boat in
 the fall of 1855 he accompanied two englishmen dickenson and ogilvie to saint paul it was supposed to be a
 big game hunting trip but the sioux in that area being in their usual warlike mood turned the journey into
 a hunted trip by the time saint paul was reached the englishmen decided to return to upper canada so joe

 is hard to resist such pleadings as this the police are doing everything possible but their means are necessarily restricted

 saskatchewan country n w t arrived here a few days ago to confer with louis riel and if possible prevail
 upon him to return to their country with them for the purpose of explaining and proving certain rights promised them
 by the canadian government at the time of the confederation when riel was at the head of the then existing
 provisional government on thursday the party again passed through this town on their way home and mr riel was with
 them accompanied by micheal dumas one of the delegates mr riel paid the sun office a short call in conversation
 with the gentleman we learned that they represent the halfbreed element of the north west territory or the unsurveyed portion
 of it that is people who are living on land the government has not as yet officially surveyed and while
 they are not delegated by the white settlers they have their full sympathy and good will the white emmigrant settler
 has the same grounds for complaint that the halfbreeds have as early as 1865 hahfbreeds and white settlers located homes
 on the two branches of the saskatchewan river and built homes for themselves the land had not been surveyed but
 the settlers established their lines and boundaries satisfactorily among themselves subject to a government survey when such should be made
 now the dominion government refuses to recognize or acknowledge any of these settlers as having any right to the land
 they occupy and refuse to survey or grant them titles in direct violation of pledges made to the people of
 manitoba at the time of the confederation of the provinces which was to be a precedent by which the same
 matters should be adjusted in all the at that time unorganized territory west of it as soon as such became
 necessary this delegation is composed of the following gentlemen james isbister gabriel dumont moses ouehlette and micheal dumas who are
 wealthy and educated residing at prince albert a settlement at the forks of the saskatchewan river mr riel says that
 he is an american citizen and that he considers the hand over which the stars and stripes wave his home
 and now only goes to assist his people as much as hays in his power and after which be it
 much or little he will return to montana meeting louis riel today recalls annther day some fifteen years ago when
 led by the now famous colonel wolsley we with some five hundred others marched in close column over the ground
 where the city of winnipeg now stands and up to the walls of fort garry then occupied by mr riel
 and his rebel army we remember how the massive gates were battered down by the excited soldiers how we rushed
 in over the fallen timbers expecting a hand to hand conflict but to find the birds flown the fort empty
 it was queer to sit and talk to this man and remember how as a drummer boy of fifteen we
 longed to spill his blood or see someone else do it as ardently as any vet in the regiment we
 recalled the opening of scott s supposed grave in the courtyard of the fort the coffin pulled from it opened
 its contents bricks and shavings we remembered that scott s burial place was never found but we did not ask
 mr r to tell us where those bones await the final trumpet call because we don t believe he knows
