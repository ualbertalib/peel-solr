 is an amateur musician who has recently received a ba from the university of calgary people both residents and outsiders
 have viewed western canada differently at various times in the past at any particular period however the image that predominated
 was a tiniform one shaped primarily by external influences i propaganda scientific data and literature all presented common and somewhat
 predetermined and self serving images of the west images reflected in the songs and music of western canada there is
 unfortunately not a large body of songs indigenous to western canada and in particular to alberta there are many reasons
 for this one is in the nature of the folk music genre folk music is primarily oral or aural and
 is often altered to reflect the experiences of the people of a particular region then there has been an argument
 that folk music was frowned upon by the anglo saxon elite in western canada because such music was culturally based
 and its performance tended to reinforce the cultural heritage of immigrants and thus delayed assimilation 2 the reverse may also
 be true perhaps some non anglo saxon immigrants held folk songs in low regard as they sought to conform to
 canadian traditions and expectations finally technological advances may have proven to be an obstacle to the develop agej of stein
 canada ment of a folk music tradition in western oh calgary my calgary theme which links them together is the
 canada because the west was settled you re surely home sweet home to me recently the region was not isolated
 though far away i ll always say portrayal of the region in a positive light you re the best town
 in the world in order to attract settlers for a sufficient time span to allow the dev my calgary elopment
 of an indigenous folk music consider for example the songt won t tradition to occur before the introduction the song
 was written by harr y hurchcroft you come come come to me in canada of rapid communication and transporta and
 published in 1924 mr hutchcroft which presents a view of life in canada that son the invention of radio and
 recording was needless to say a calgary resident is unrealistic and to a large extent idealdevices did much to stifle
 the folk music this is typ ical of booster songs in its un istic the expansionist dream widely process or
 at the ver y least to alter the critical promotion of a region the images held at that time and
 honestly believed process considerably 3 in another song hip hz hoo ray for that canada was a land in which
 all things this is not to say that there is i folk canada suggest that canada in general were possible
 is reflected in the chorus music tradition in western canada but simply to state that it is a rather limited

 not indigenous to the region in any presented an image of western canada as on our wedding day event an
 examination of folk songs a mild and hospitable region an area alone would provide only a distorted and where the
 wild flowers blossom and partial view of the west and accordingly the mountain maples grow this view is above the

 plains and rockies alberta history summer 1992 7 the image of western canada as a source ‘of riches to be
 exploited is almost as old and enduring as canada itself perhaps the earliest song from british columbia 1 tells about
 the first fraser river gold rush x 1 ritten in july 1859 the untitled song refers to the hardships faced
 by the gold miners in their quest for riches i far from home far from home ‘ to dig the
 golden ore on frazer sicj river shore we labor hard so does our bard the predominant image in this song
 is that of isolation and loneliness the plaintive cry of the chorus far from home far from home suggests a
 we ll drive away upon our sleigh longing for civilization and for familiar so if you ll be my wife
 surroundings by miners facing unknown we ll be happy for life in my cosy canadian honle si deprivations in the
 pursuit of gold a willingness to work hard most often the hardships were inflicted a willingness to work hard was
 viewed as upon humans by nature although in was viewed as being all that being all that was necessary for

 dominion was necessary for personal indicated in the song mi frrtunes ofan government and eastern influences such unlucky king describing

 my life ever the reality of western canadian homestead life as indicated from the the isolation experienced by alberta a
 frontier society images presented in non booster songs settlers and homesteaders is also noted in is vastly different the song
 pembina river homestead for example perhaps the best known you get mighty hungry western canadian song in the folk song
 while rolling the logs and living alone with genre is the red river valley whether it 25 the coyotes and
 dogs was written about the river in manitoba or the one in texas the song was widely the similarity of
 some of the lines in below sung on the prairies because it held some pembina river homestead ie and i

 theme in western were very few women on the prairies in f w the early years and thus most men

 and his songs repre above sent an attempt to portray this reality f wilf carter has been one of western
 canada s most popularfolk singers and perhaps to accept it for several decades he is seen here in the earl

 the weather there are a number of songs in which the weather is portrayed as the noon s hang ing
 low my lit an enemy or at the very least a condition to be endured it was such an important
 following verses are any indication of from the song pembina river homestead part of the western canadian scene that their
 opinions and feelings comes the following lines even the composers of the booster songs saskatchewan the land of snow in
 the land of alberta could not ignore it the image of the where winds are always on the blow the
 land of the king weather which was present in their songs where people sit with frozen toes horseflies and mosquitos
 however failed to reflect the true situa and why we stay here no one knows much sorrow they bring tion
 and was couched in positive terms saskatchewan saskatchewan a similar negative image of insects is ‘ lie sky was always
 blue and cloudless there place like saskatchewan esent in the alberta homesteader there was sunshine ev ry day 23 it
 was we sit and gaze across the plain never cold and rarely did it snow in the and wonder why
 it never rains five miles f rom water and west the breeze not the wind was p ine and gabriel
 blows his trumpet sound sixty miles from town scented and whispered sweet melodies he says ‘ the rain she s
 gone around 3 the grasshoppers came and ate my crop down other songs were written in a more neg in
 a sense these songs all resulted from the images in these and other western stive vein although they were often
 attempts by the songwriters to present a tinged with humour they presented an more realistic albeit sometimes humor songs suggest
 that not only were insects alternative view of western canada they ous view of the climate than had been a
 pest and an annoyance but that they describe a region where it rained and offered by the booster songs these
 song were also a real threat in an economic hailed all summer 25 or where writers tried to portray the
 west as they sense a swarm of grasshoppers could actually saw wreak havoc on a crop as could any of
 it was raining and hailing this morning the number of insect species at the corner of portage and main it
 is rather interesting to note that even now its noon in such songs as saskatchewan which the late 1930 s
 saw the resurgence of and the basements are flooded was written during the great depression positive images of western canada
 in a and the duststorms are starting again 26 of the 1 930 s that people still believed musical format
 in such songs as my little the distress and concern felt by the that western canada was a utopia in
 yoho lady sung by the popular cornprairie settler whether urban or rural at which all of their dreams and aspirations
 mercial artist wilf carter the west was the harshness of nature is evident in the would ultimately be fulfilled once
 again portrayed as a utopia following lines but still we love you saskatchewan i m longing tonight once again to
 roam we re proud to say we re native one s in a beautiful valley i could oh it s
 forty below in the winter so count your blessings drop by drop always call home and it s twenty below
 in the fall next year we ll have a bumper crop 3 there s a girl i adore and am
 and it rises to zero in the springtime longing to see and we don t have no summer at all
 2 in the beautiful yoho valley westerners needed to believe that their songs expressing similar sentiments are situation would improve
 such after all similarly the image of the desirabili ty of common to all three prairie provinces was the reason
 many of them migrated to the rural agrarian ranching lifestyle was the area in the first place and their songs
 again promoted in the commercial songs ‘ i his would seem to indicate that the reflect this need to some
 extent current of the i 930 s and 1 940 s weather was a universal topic of con songs about
 western canada also contain versation many albertans probably there s no worries or cares to shared the feelings of this
 songwriter utopian images perhaps a recognition press on my mind of the need to believe in a just society i
 never have room to complain who was contemplating emigration to the united states if western canadians were not complain all
 my friends are kind and true and my burdens are few ing about the weather or the isolation ‘ way
 out on the western range farewell to the poor homesteader farewell to the land so free then it was the
 insects and other pests farewell to sunny alberta that they were concerned about here is western canada was once more
 seen as a she s too damn cold for me 28 a typ ical example land of opportunity this image
 remained a popular one during the post war years this negative view of alberta s climate how happy i feel
 when i roll into bed during the 1 950 s such songs as alberta the rattlesnake rattles a tune at
 iny head was echoed b y another alberta song the little mosquito devoid of all fear were written and sung
 scotty stevenson writer who described the province as a crawls over my face and into my ear also known as
 alberta slim presented an place where the wind never ceases and the little bed bug so cheerful and bright arcadian
 image of the province as an oil the rain always falls 29 it keeps me up laughing two thirds of
 the night rich region which had a strong agrarian saskatchewan songwriters and settlers and the smart little flea with economic
 sector 37 tacks in his toes were even more outspoken in their crawls up through my whiskers there was very
 little change in the image condemnation of the weather if the and tickles my nose of western canada in the
 years following alberta history summer 1992 world war two singers and songwriters overhead a chair and a bed in a
 room the belief in the superiori ty of rural life still focused upon the weather as an without a view
 40 stephen fearing a is very prevalent in the songs of gary important part of the western exper vancouver artist
 sings about the plight fjellg ard and ian tyson tyson has over ience one recent song saskatoon refers of the
 forgotten and homeless members the last few years released a series of to the harshness of the prairie winter of
 society in welfare wednesday recordings which glorify the cowboy and saskatoon the writer notes gets very ranching lifestyle fjellgard another
 and tomorrow when daylight cold in the winter prairie winds blowing drags me hungry from my bed popular western singer
 songwriter unhard 38 ian tyson also sings about the with nothing in my pocket abashedly promotes the rural lifestyle in
 weather and the opportunities for success seagulls at the docks are likely better fed his songs cowboy in your heart
 is typical in alberta in a revised version of the classic so i go down to the food bank of
 his writing and all my friends are there folk song four strong windz standing in a long and broken line
 all the days drag on like an and i can see you re still a dreamer think i ll go
 out to alberta weather s good there in the fall apathetic marathon sometimes stumble in the dark welfare wednesday 4
 and though your lives be uneventful got some friends that i can go there s a cowboy in your heart
 to working for these artists are not writing in isolation and i love the taste of freedom if i get
 there before the snow flies for them to be able to write such songs the wind the earth and the
 sky and if things are going good there must be an image for them to pre and i will roam
 and i will wander you could meet me if i send and be a cowboy ‘ till i die you
 down the fare sent and a tradition for them to refute but if you wait until it s winter the
 questioning of a idealistic view of besides promoting rural life and its per it will be no good the west
 which occurs in these two ceived benefits of personal freedom and ‘ cause that wind can sure blow cold songs
 requires that such a utopian image closeness to nature fjellgard also sings way out there 39 of society still exists
 about urban life life in the ci ty is how while the weather may be a central theme and such
 an image does still exist the ever presented in a more negative manner in the music of western canada there
 has aforementioned songs are noteworthy now there s a man who rides the been a noticeable change in the image
 not only because they reject the utopian bus to the factory every day it presents the booster songs stress the
 vision of western canada by pointing he s got no time for chasing dreams positive aspects of the weather while
 out that the dream has yet to be realized he s left along the way he s lost the time
 and innocence the realists perhaps in response to the by many people but also because these galloping the bay overly
 optimistic images of the boosters songs deal with urban society a man s imagination leaves when emphasized the harsh aspects
 of the the myth that a rural agrarian lifestyle is he become of age environment on the other hand current
 somehow more desirable or superior to in many ways the contrary image of songwriters and artists are presenting the its
 urban counterpart is a common one image in a more matter of fact way this musically this myth is present
 in such western canada as presented in modern cha nge suggests that western canadians contemporary songs as lloyd arntzen s
 music is not much different from what it have learned to adapt to the weather to saskatchewan farewell arntzen delivers
 a was when the region was first settled see the region as it truly is as the general bittersweet image
 of life in saskatchewan perhaps the biggest difference is that the population saw no need to be overly in this
 song about a family that is forced to weather is no longer seen as a subject that concerned with the
 weather it became move to vancouver when their farm fails is worthy of more than passing interest to a acceptable
 to deal with the climate in songwriter or a singer but the west is still songs in a realistic manner
 when we first walked this prairie seen by some writers as a land of oppor the grass was knee high
 a similar change has not occurred with we broke the thick sod up tunity while others reject this utopian beneath
 the big sky view the earlier songs usually questioned respect to the other central images in whether or not the
 west was a land of milk western canadian music the west is but the sod turned to dust and honey
 while new songs seem to ask still portrayed by some singer songwriters the grass it did die like our hopes
 and our dreams why everyone hasn t benefitted from the within the folk music tradition as a place bid saskatchewan
 goodbye prosperity of the west where people have failed to share in the prosperi ty of the land stella a
 song by arntzen may simply be expressing the to a large extent the idealistic view of spirit of the west
 presents the image natural emotions felt by people losing western canada is still one of the rural of an old
 woman who is forced to find their farms to drought low prices and agrarian paradise where independence a new place
 to live once her building high costs all themes of many prairie freedom and self reliance are key eleis condemned
 stella s needs are not songs yet there is an implication that ments as ian tyson says i guess it
 ain t extravagant all she seeks is just a roof there is a resulting dislike for urban life changed all
