 december the society of poles was obviously losing out to its competition in the cultural field but the resources on
 both sides were limited activists in the two groups soon realized that the split did not serve the community we
 are divided between the two parishes so we cannot achieve anything complained the representative of the national catholics 5 a
 general meeting of the society of poles was called for january 13 1932 to solve the impasse an appeal was
 made to all the poles irrespective of their religious affiliation to unite but the progressives failed to attend 2 problems
 continued to plague the polish community the holy cross congregation suffered a setback when its parish council resigned after the
 first priest fled to the united states allegedly taking the congregation s money with him a second priest did his
 best but the damage had already been done the people felt deceived they had lost trust in the national church
 and were not prepared to come back the fate of the holy cross parish was doomed 7 however the collapse
 of the parish did not end the divisions within the society of poles on june 25 1932 a new organization
 the polish national progressive society was formed under the banner the more there are polish organizations the better for the
 polish cause the organizers reported that their principal mission was to unite all the poles in edmonton and the surrounding
 areas irrespective of their party affiliations political or religious convictions through lectures national celebrations schools theatre plays concerts and dances
 the society planned to work towards the achievement of higher intellectual standards increased patriotism and the fostering of social and
 cultural activities the society also pledged to care for the sick and disadvantaged and to maintain fraternal relations among its
 members society s constitution the intent of the resolution was to ensure that people could be members of the society
 irrespective of their religious affiliations the existence of two religious denominations in the community justified such an assurance however this
 statement in conjunction with the election of a new board of directors that included members of the polish national catholic
 parish was quickly opposed by the previous management who belonged to the holy rosary roman catholic parish the roman catholic
 priests then withdrew their support for the collection of funds for the hall and under the circumstances the new president
 felt obliged to resign 4 after the controversy had passed the society of poles presented a theatre performance in april
 but their opponents who were now grouped around the holy cross national catholic parish were much more effective an amateur
 circle formed by wladyslaw rajs presented three plays in may and two comedies in june also in may the first
 spring picnic of the parish was held and included the participation of zbyszko cyganiewicz a world famous polish wrestler in

 the society of poles had meanwhile lost most of its members but was still the proud owner of the polish
 hall 4 the end of the year brought some new developments on the national scene in octobem the fifth congress
 of the federation of the polish societies in canada was held in montreal where it adopted roman catholicism as the
 religion of polish societies embraced by the federation until then the federation had remained neutral as regards religion and politics
 although probably well intended and perhaps even justified in the light of problems facing poland at that time the compromise
 did nothing for the cause of unification 42 in edmonton it led to a further strengthening of the control of
 the local parish over the society of poles and intensified the division within the polish community the parish priest was
 now not only the chaplain of the society but also a member of its board of directors and the actual
 leader of the poles in edmonton when dealing with the canadian authorities 43 the defenders of the fatherland on the
 other hand by appointing the polish consul as their honorary president demonstrated that they were looking for guidance from outside
 the local parish 44 a letter written by the group in an attempt to unite all the forces for the
 common cause met with the following rebuff from the society of poles in accordance with a unanimous resolution the society
 of poles will address all the matters national and other with the participation of the local parish and no one

 polish veterans celebrated the 3 rd may constitution and the 4 th anniversary of marshall pilsudski s death in rented
 premises they also had to rent space for a farewell evening on november 4 th to honour the first group
 of the polish soldiers in the canadian army leaving for overseas 42 meanwhile the society of poles unable to achieve
