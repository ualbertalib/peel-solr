 2 the patrician 2000 vp colonel in chief princess patricia s canadian light infantry message from the colonel in chief 
 the countess mountbatten of burma cbe cd jp dl the year 2000 was another successful year for the regiment patricia 
 s have continued to perform extremely well on overseas deployments whether deployed as a unit or on individual assignment on 
 professional courses on exercise or during the performance of their normal garrison duties once again i was most fortunate to 
 have had the opportunity to visit all three battalions of the regiment during the past year i was able to 
 visit along with my eldest 0:eld 0:est son norton lord romsey third battalion during their recently completed tour in bosnia 
 it was certainly evident that their presence and efforts had made a signifigant difference and that their dedication and preseverance 
 with the mission had ensured a successful tour of duty it was again a pleasure to visit canada this year 
 and i was pleased to attend the change of command ceremony for the second battalion with my son micheal john 
 they did an excellent job despite being in the midst of pre deployment training for their upcoming mission to bosnia 
 i was particularly pleased to have the opportunity 0:opportu 0:nity to participate again in the presentation of new colours to 
 the first battalion having 0:hav 0:ing presented the old colours in calgary in 1977 the change of colonels of the 
 regiment which also took place was an important event in our patricias history which i always find a very important 
 and moving 0:mov 0:ing occasion on behalf of all the members of my regiment i would like once more to 
 thank mgen hewson for his outstanding service and dedication to the care of the patricias so ably helped and supported 
 by his wife norah to whom we are also most grateful we are very fortunate to have as his successor 
 such a distinguished and well known patricia as general de chastelain who we welcome most warmly and look forward to 
 his contributions and involvment over the coming years i am sure that the year 2001 will offer more exciting challenges 
 to all members 0:mem 0:bers of the regiment i am looking forward to the publication of the new regimental history 
 which is being authored by david bercuson a considerable amount of work has gone into the planning and preparation of 
 this volume and my thanks on behalf of all ranks of the regiment go out to all those who voluntarily 
 contributed so much of their time and energy to capturing the meaning of the regiment in addition lam looking 0:look 
 0:ing forward to my visit to the second battalion in bosnia and then joining them in winnipeg for the celebrations 
 surrounding the 50th anniversary of the battle of kap yong i am confident that patricia s everywhere will continue to 
 lead by example and that their professional endeavours and achievements will continue to be outstanding 0:out 0:standing examples of our 
 proud heritage 
 the patrician 2000 3 vp colonel of the regiment princess patricia s canadian light infantry message from the colonel of 
 the regiment general a j g d de chastelain oc cmm ch cd the regiment celebrated the year 2000 by 
 having each of its three battalions deployed at one time or another on operational duty in the former yugoslavia as 
 the year began first battalion was in the run down to a very successful and eventful tour in kosovo and 
 third battalion deployed on what was to be an equally successful tour in bosnia as the year ends second battalion 
 is half way through its tour in bosnia also serving with professionalism 0:profession 0:alism and elan as ever our colonel 
 in chief followed a demanding program during the year to visit each of her battalions and to meet as many 
 patricias and their families as possible during the summer she visited winnipeg and presided at the second battalion s change 
 of command and then moved to edmonton to present new colours to first battalion and preside at their trooping of 
 those colours also in edmonton she presided at the change of colonel of the regiment when major general bill hewson 
 handed over to me after six years of highly active and dedicated service to the regiment in that role that 
 event gave me my first opportunity to see the regiment back in its new home station and the centralised organisation 
 of the brigade group with two battalions of the regiment side by side in the same garrison not only was 
 it a great honour to be back in uniform and to fill the appointment of colonel but it was an 
 excellent opportunity for me to see so many old friends and to renew regimental acquaintances that have been dormant for 
 years the opportunity to accompany lady patricia and her son lord romsey to bosnia in july and to visit the 
 3 ppcli battle group there gave me the chance to see at first hand how well our soldiers are conducting 
 that difficult assignment one sad aspect of every year is the loss of old comrades within the regiment this year 
 ended particularly sadly with the death of princess patricia s son captain sandy ramsay in scotland colonel suds sutherland in 
 ottawa and with the untimely death in croatia of lieutenant general gord reay we grieve with their families as we 
 do for all patricia s for whom last post sounded this year the year 2001 beckons with the promise of 
 new challenges for all patricia s serving and retired the ceremonies surrounding the 50th anniver 
 4 the patrician 2000 vp sary of the battle of kapyong in the summer will give our korean war veterans 
 0:veter 0:ans the opportunity to re live once again their experiences of that conflict it will give the rest of 
 us the chance to reflect with pride on the outstanding role they and all the battalions of the regiment played 
 in it change of appointment of the colonel of the regiment lady patricia is flanked by the out going cor 
 mgen hewson on her left and on her right by the incoming cor gen a j g d de chastelain 
 the parade commenced at 1330 hrs with the members of first battalion ppcli being marched on to the parade square 
 before nearly 3 500 spectators the weather had been mildly co operative during lady patricia s inspection of the troops 
 the crowd whispered their concerns as the wind picked up and the clouds rolled in all were concerned that a 
 sudden 0:sud 0:den cloud burst would put a damper on things however this thought was quickly eliminated when lady patricia 
 stepped onto the parade square to consecrate the colours the wind died down as the sun broke through the clouds 
 and shone brightly over the honourable members of the ist battalion the consecration of the new colours was followed by 
 the change of appointment of the colonel of the regiment the outgoing colonel of the regiment mgen c w hewson 
 ret d had done much for the patricia s during his six year tenure and everyone was sad to see 
 him leave however 0:howev 0:er the incoming colonel of the regiment gen a j g d john de chastelain ret 
 d was warmly welcomed gen de chastelain is well known internationally for his reputation of being a peacekeeper and recently 
 0:recent 0:ly as a peacemaker with his involvement in the northern ireland peace talks which led to good friday agreement

 the patrician 2000 23 vp brigader general a h gaultall lit up maj ret harry bloom on the 19th september 
 2000 on a glorious summer evening the members of the ottawa branch had the pleasure of seeing the newly installed 
 lights on hamilton gault s statue turned on for the first time the lights brightened the statue and that corner 
 of the site of the national war memorial which our regiment has the honour to occupy with a statue to 
 our regiment and founder the lights were turned on by jean pigott who was the prime mover in launching the 
 lighting project the funding for the lighting project came primarily from the members of the ottawa branch serving members in 
 the ottawa area the hamilton gault memorial fund and a most generous donation of our retiring colonel of the regiment 
 maj gen bill hewson and his wife norah a reception followed the lighting ceremony in the army mess where several 
 questions were raised regarding the origins of the statue and how it came to occupy such a prime location according 
 to local media reports the gault statue was provided 0:pro 0:vided for in the terms of hamilton gault s will 
 that it was the wish of hamilton gault to establish a statue in ottawa to honour his memory 0:memo 0:ry 
 this interpretation of gault s intentions has never made much sense he was a most selfless man dedicated to honour 
 the memory 0:mem 0:ory of fallen patricias and to perpetuate the continued existence of the regiment he had lived through 
 the anxious years of the great depression when the very existence of the regiment was constantly threatened it is most 
 likely that he wished to place a memorial statue 0:stat 0:ue in ottawa to be a constant reminder to it 
 s citizens of the sacrifice 0:sacri 0:fice and huge contribution made by the regiment to preserve the freedoms of all 
 canadians the origins of the statue in ottawa go back to february 1988 when leslie gault nephew of our founder 
 came to ottawa to press the national capital commission ncc to locate the gault statue at the national war memorial 
 what he didn t realise was that jean pigott then the chairman of the ncc already knew a great deal 
 about the ppcli and was well disposed to grant his request she approved the placing of the site across the 
 street from the national war memorial and where lies today the tomb of the unknown soldier jean pigott s connection 
 with the regiment was through her husband s uncle pte m w kedey a graduate of the 
 vp ontario agriculture college who enlisted in the university company university of toronto 1915 was mortally wounded at mount sorrel 
 july 1916 and buried in nottingham cemetery derbyshire england after a most amazing funeral it happened that bill kedey was 
 a mason and papers were discovered at his death from timiskaming masonic lodge new liskeard ontario and these were brought 
 to the attention of the duke of derbyshire provincial grand master who had just been named as the new governor 
 general of canada the whole town of derby participatec in the funeral the procession was lead by a firing party 
 and regimental 0:regi 0:mental band of the sherwood foresters the hearse carried the union jack draped coffin and was drawn 
 by four black horses pte kedey was buried with full military and masonic honours by a town in england which 
 felt a great feeling of sympathy for this fine young lad who died so far from home and friends it 
 was through this combination 0:com 0:bination of circumstances that gault s wish got the green light it was the link 
 through pte kedey which determined that the statue site should be given such important prominence that it now occupies ground 
 that is almost sacred was enhanced this summer with the unveiling of the tomb of the unknown soldier this site 
 is now a must see for every tourist s itinerary and the attraction of visitors 0:visi 0:tors to the gault 
 statue is now well established there are now proposals from both the navy and air force to build memorials on 
 the site and the regiment should be aware that our statue could well become the focus of the army memorial 
 the location 0:loca 0:tion of this statue is as much a memorial to pte kedey as it is to brig 
 hamilton gault and as such it honours all the gallant patricias who have died in the service of their country

 vp remembering the patricia family in bosnia on august 25th the third battalion princess patricia s canadian light infantry battle 
 group gathered at camp maple leaf in zgon bosnia at dusk to remember sgt jerry squires on the anniversary of 
 his death sgt squires died in greece during his 96 hour leave while serving with kfor in kosovo the service 
 of remembrance was attended by over 200 soldiers including his close friends deployed with the bg and was led by 
 the bg padre captain neil parker we were fortunate to have sergeant dan mclean to guide us in choosing the 
 most appropriate way to remember his friend as the padre began to speak the canadian flag the nato flag and 
 the patricia flag were lowered following the lament on bagpipes and a moment of silence for jerry the flags were 
 again raised for our lives that continue our padre spoke heart felt words to explain what the loss of jerry 
 means to the regiment using the words of isaiah chapter 49 he said i will not forget you i have

 26 the patrician 2000 v vp pilgrimage to holland 2000 55th anniversary of the liberation col ret c s frost 
 this is a report of my participation in the ceremonies marking this anniversary due to illness i was only able 
 to take part in the main events and those of special interest to the ppcli i arrived in apeldorn on 
 thursday april 27 the hotel and many of the houses were festooned with flowers ribbons and balloons large signs declared 
 welcome canada thank you liberators we remember the entire city was in a festive mood april 28 twello voorst wilp 
 next day april 28 i was picked up by col ritse reitsma and driven 0:driv 0:en to twello the seat 
 of the municipal government of the municipality of voorst on arrival at twello i was greeted by the mayor johannes 
 van blommestein and the chairman of the local liberation committee major general messerschmidt a former dutch officer the purpose of 
 my visit was to take part in the opening of the canadian club a hotel and restaurant which had been 
 made into a central meeting place for the canadian veterans in voorst such wonderful friendly people my friendship goes back 
 to 1985 when i made my first pilgrimage to a small village in the municipality of voorst by the name 
 of wilp this village has a special significance for the ppcli because it was the final objective of operation cannonshot 
 the crossing of the ijssel river april 11 1945 the regiment repulsed a strong counter attack by 120 german infantry 
 three tanks an sp gun and supporting 0:sup 0:porting vehicles the purpose of my visit in 1985 was to dispell 
 a rumour that the 48th highlanders were claiming it was they who had attacked across the ijssel and captured wilp 
 after visiting the mayor of voorst mr van blommestein his chief engineer col reitsma and other citizens of the municipality 
 and showing them the war diary and history of the ppcli i had no difficulty in convincing them it was 
 the ppcli who had crossed the river and captured wilp not the 48th highlanders consequently as soon as col reitsma 
 heard the true facts he insisted that he buy me a drink at the pub in wilp he escorted me 
 and two other patricias bert bolton and john moore to the pub and we duly toasted 0:toast 0:ed the liberation 
 of wilp some forty years earlier then as a tangible expression of the close ties between wilp voorst and the 
 ppcli we exchanged our regimental ties to return to mr van blommestein he made full amends for having overlooked the 
 ppcli prior to my visit in 1985 in 1990 he arranged for the dutch engineers to erect a pontoon bridge 
 at the very site of the original 0:origi 0:nal crossing as i was d company commander within this operation i 
 was given the honour of leading a parade across the bridge in a jeep 
 the patrician 2000 27 vp instead of in a buffalo that had conveyed me in 1945 it was an enormous 
 undertaking to say nothing of the expense involved the friendship and generosity of the dutch people was truly overwhelming 0:over 
 0:whelming these small villages are also important to the ppcli because the regiment liberated them in 1945 the citizens have 
 never forgotten in 1995 as part of the anniversary liberation ceremonies they erected a monument to the ppcli and buried 
 a time capsule containing extracts maps and photos from the regimental history on april 29 this year the villagers organised 
 a parade to show the canadian liberators their gratitude i was asked to lead the parade in a jeep the 
 people lined the streets several rows deep and gave us a tumultuous welcome the veterans were conveyed in ww ii 
 vehicles restored by members of keep them rolling organisation this unique collection 0:col 0:lection of vehicles even included a 1942 
 chaffee tank the parade took three hours and during the whole time it poured with rain i was soaked to 
 the skin but the rain didn t seem to bother the people many of whom had taken up strategic positions 
 an hour before the parade started it was truly an unforgettable demonstration of their love and respect for canadian veterans 
 many of the spectators were young children four and five years old who bravely stood in the rain waving canadian 
 flags and crying thank you canada several of those tots no doubt urged on by their mothers ran to my 
 jeep with all sorts of gifts flowers cookies art work of their own making decals postcards with their name and 
 address asking me to send them a postcard i have dutifully complied with each request after the parade there was 
 a reception where we were served a typical dutch meal kale and sausage stew i had three helpings to restore 
 my circulation may 2 national canadian liberation monument this is one of the few events which i believe received some 
 notice in the canadian press on may 2 a statue was unveiled to pay a lasting tribute to the canadian 
 liberators and to express the deeply felt solidarity 0:sol 0:idarity between the netherlands and canada the statue 4 6 meters 
 high cast from bronze shows a male figure with both arms raised each hand holds a hat signifying freedom and 
 apeldoorn s liberation in 1945 the statue is referred to as the the man with two hats in a brief 
 ceremony general gijsbers delivered a moving address and the statue was unveiled by hrh princess margriet the local school have 
 adopted the monument and it will be maintained by the students the dutch people would like to see a similar 
 monument erected in ottawa may 4 national remembrance day memorial service on this day the dutch remember their own people 
 who perished during the war shortly after i arrived in holland i was asked by col reitsma if i would 
 give an address in a church at de vecht a small village in the municipality of voorst i had long 
 felt that the sacrifices and suffering 
 vp the dutch people endured during the war should be recognised i was therefore honoured and pleased to accept col 
 reitsma s invitation to speak after the service we all assembled for lunch at a nearby restaurant in the teuge 
 airport this airport has a special significance for the dutch because it was here that the dutch royal family first 
 landed on dutch soil after the war may 7 national parade apeldoorn for many this is the highlight of the 
 weeklong ceremonies veterans from all over holland converge on apeldoorn to take part in this parade estimates of the numbers 
 vary but probably about 2500 veterans took part most of them were conveyed in ww ii reconditioned vehicles driven by 
 the keep them rolling organisation the enthusiasm of the crowds was overwhelming our route through the city was lined with 
 people some standing 15 ranks deep parents and grandparents with their young children waved canadian flags and gave us the 
 thumbs up or the victory salute shouts of thank you canada we shall never forget filled the air in a 
 way this was the most significant pilgrimage of them all fiftyfive 0:fifty 0:five years is a very long time and 
 memories do fade but not in apeldoorn i could hardly believe the enormous crowds that greeted us wherever we went 
 and the pride and the enthusiasm of the veterans themselves was undiminished by the years perhaps it was because many 
 of us both dutch and canadians realised this would be the last pilgrimage and we all wanted to make it 
 a good one as mentioned earlier general gijsbers had appointed me parade commander i was picked up at my hotel 
 by two dutch officers and driven to the forming up place for parade in the grounds of the paleis het 
 loo promptly at 1400 hours the parade moved off with my jeep in the lead immediately the crowds started to 
 roar and little children advanced on my jeep bearing flowers and other gifts with letters asking me to write it 
 was a section of patricians in the national parade in apeldorn led by wally smith 28 the patrician 2000 
 the patrician 2000 29 vp beekbergan all over again but on a much larger scale and thankfully the weather was 
 beautiful unlike beekbergan soon i approached the saluting base the jeep stopped i got out stood to attention and saluted 
 princess margriet canadian veterans formed up and ready to march past your royal highness she then invited 0:invit 0:ed me 
 to join her on the dais along with her husband pieter van vollenhoven mayor de graaf and other dignitaries the 
 veterans were really magnificent and i felt very proud to be standing there with my patricia blazer beret and cap 
 badge as i say most were driven in ww ii vehicles but quite a number walked a section of patricias 
 with a regimental banner marched past i recognised some of them doug armstrong was with wife pauline wally smith charlie 
 king lloyd and olga rains elwood birss and rudy deutsch after the parade princess margriet invited a group of us 
 to her home for tea i hitched a ride with general gijsbers and we quickly arrived at the royal residence 
 before the other guests met by several uniformed guards we were ushered into the garden to await hrh in a 
 few moments she appeared with her husband pieter van vollenhoven apologised for not meeting us and offered drinks until the 
 other guests arrived the four of us relaxed and talked about the parade and the wonderful canadian veterans her husband 
 is a former pilot and was very interested in military operations he and hrh wanted to know how the first 
 division was moved all the way from italy to holland in time to join the battle to help liberate holland 
 i was happy to tell them about operation goldflake how the first canadian corps was moved in great secrecy from 
 under the very noses of the germans along the banks of senio river to an embarkation area near pisa from 
 there by ship to marseilles then by lorry up the rhone valley to belgium and finally to a concentration area 
 in holland all in a space of six weeks the germans did not have a clue as to the whereabouts 
 of the canadians until the patricia s assaulted across the ijissel river in buffaloes on april 11 1945 may 8 
 farewell party it is a long standing tradition that on the last night of the pilgrimage the veterans honour their 
 hosts at a farewell party this year the event was held in a large convention hall which had been transformed 
 into a central meeting place for the veterans and their friends and renamed 0:re 0:named the canadian club the hall 
 was gaily decorated a buffet was served and a band played throughout the evening it was my last chance to 
 thank my friends in apeldoorn for all their kindness not only during 0:dur 0:ing this pilgrimage but in many cases 
 going back some fifteen years may 9 achteveld monument to ppcli from a regimental point of view my visit to 
 achteveld was probably 0:proba 0:bly the most rewarding it was here that the regiment ended the war it was also 
 the site of the famous food truce on april 30 1945 held in the little schoolhouse right in my d 
 company area on may 9 i participated in 
 30 the patrician 2000 vp a very impressive program that extended over the entire afternoon the schoolroom where the truce 
 took place is now a museum and was opened to the public in my speech i referred to the fact 
 that 1000 miles from achtevelt near a little village in sicily called ispica there stands another monument to honour the 
 soldiers of the ppcli and the first division who assaulted the beaches of sicily on july 10 1943 i concluded 
 by saying now we have two monuments marking the beginning and the end of the long march of the ppcli 
 from the rugged beaches of sicily to the pleasant pastures of holland thus ended a most remarkable day in the 
 life of this patricia so ends phase lof my trip to europe in may 2000 after a short rest in 
 amsterdam i undertook phase ii sicily but that is another story c s frost ppcli colonel retired june 28 2000

 well deserved break with our families 0:fam 0:ilies soldiers of the first battalion arrived back to work in january 2000 
 focused and ready to train all ranks worked extremely hard to ensure that the transition from kosovo to unit training 
 went smoothly this year was indeed historic as the battalion received the new lav 111 and the new communications 0:com 
 0:munications system and began the process of building a mechanized force equipped with the newest and finest infantry vehicle in 
 nato while soldiers and their skills remain foremost we are delighted to receive the new warfighting 0:warfight 0:ing equipment a 
 company alpha company experienced many changes over the course of the year 2000 the company s vehicles were left in 
 kosovo the command structure 0:struc 0:ture of the company underwent a complete turn over during aps 2000 and for the 
 first time in 2 years newly trained patricias from wainwright were posted in the company was reconstituted on 17 jan 
 00 upon returning from kosovo january was a sad month for the company as we said good bye to our 
 augmentees from c company who served with a company in kosovo after disembarkation leave the company participated in a very 
 successful two day ski school held at marmot basin jasper we spent february and some of march sharpening our patrolling 
 skills which culminated in ex silent devil this exercise was a four day company level exercise that focused on dismounted 
 patrolling including reconnaissance missions and raids the exercise was a great success and concluded with a series of platoon level 
 fighting patrols the remainder of march and april was spent gearing up for ex stalwart ram this exercise which was 
 broken into three phases the first phase had us situated in a company size patrol base from where the company 
 conducted reconnaissance patrols which provided the battalion with vital intelligence on the enemy phase two consisted of a battalion sized 
 deliberate attack on an enemy strong point based on the information provided 0:provid 0:ed by us it was only fitting 
 that we were inserted by helicopter to set the stage for the battalion attack the final phase of the exercise 
 saw us attached to the ldsh rc to be enemy force against the remainder of the battalion needless to say 
 the red devils struck fear into the hearts of their enemies proving to be an insurmountable force 
 june was marked by the arrival of 13 new privates 0:pri 0:vates from watc and the departure of the oc 
 maj sharpe 2ic capt liebert and the csm mwo hamilton no sooner had they left when their replacements arrived led 
 by the new oc maj reeves and 2ic capt johnston and csm mwo ames after a month of ibts training 
 the company rolled into pcf cycle 0002 which was followed immediately by 0003 wo greg forsyth making the mountain man 
 look easy i vp we moved quickly into pcf cycle 0001 after the exercise while some began their gradual exposure 
 0:expo 0:sure to the lav 111 others were involved with running 0:run 0:ning the driver wheel course and attending other 
 pcf courses once again a good portion of the company was involved in various 0:vari 0:ous courses including lav 3 
 driver lav 111 gunner basic communications and driver wheel a task that once again fell to us to run oh 
 joy early december saw the red devils take flight again only this time it was a joint airmobile operation involving 
 1 cer 1 ppcli 408 sqn and more visitors than you can imagine the red devils and 4 troop icer 
 were inserted into wainwright to destroy the only navigation aid in the wainwright training area the water tower after moving 
 silently during the night a dawn attack was conducted and the tower was demolished finally the decades long questions of 
 many a log toady was answered both sides of the water tower were the same colour the year 2000 proved 
 to be an interesting and exciting year the company looks forward to the challenges that the new year will bring 
 after all the red devils rule the ground lav 111 and section working together 35 the patrician 2000

 soldiering skills when they annihilated charlie company in a series of defensive 0:defen 0:sive actions not much of a bite

 cpl weaver comparing his atv recce vehicle with the coyote pcf courses were also prominent throughout the year as the 
 soldiers 0:sol 0:diers were introduced to the lav 111 the technical aspects of the vehicle completely destroyed the myth of 
 the infantryman that many other units held and proved that today s soldiers had better do a bit of training 
 on the old playstation many soldiers are attempting to get the cf 18 qualification written off as a result of 
 all the buttons switches and checklists b company also ran a very successful driver wheeled course during the fall working 
 through a myriad of breakdowns and grounded mlvws eventually after several attempts we managed to get all the vehicles back 
 from wainwright we also took part in a combat boot trial each of the different styles of boots had their 
 good and bad points hopefully all of the good aspects will be incorporated into the infantry dream boot notable accomplishments 
 during the year included sgt mac donald s performance in the annual international sniper concentration in gagetown and pte stratford

 sight to watch as eight helicopters descended upon the objective area that cool night in march unfortunately for the enemy 
 they missed the spectacular twilight show by first light the bridge was firmly in the claws of charlie company and 
 within the hour the accompanying engineer party had blown it sky high r n the reputation of the bears spread 
 rapidly 0:rap 0:idly few wanted to wrestle with the giant beast but in april the opportunity for the bears to 
 defend against the entire advancing brigade would present itself charlie company was called upon to act as opfor for the 
 annual 1 cmbg spring exercise known this year as stalwart ram rams don t often venture into bear country and 
 for good reason the mighty bears unleashed their fury and wreaked havoc on the brigade advance by day two charlie 
 company ambushes had dislocated the forward recce elements 0:ele 0:ments from their logistical support thereby grinding to a halt the

 locate the qm at night in a hide it has been a year since our return from kosovo and though 
 we did not take up residence in wainwright or suffield like in the past the pace of our workload in

 at the quarter master platoon is an understatement the past aps saw a multitude of personnel changes including the departure 
 of the rqms mwo morrison for five years he was involved in a myriad of battalion activities and provided excellent 
 support however the most found memory he leaves behind is his distinctive laughter and good sense of humour the other 
 major change currently on going is the upgrade to the current canadian forces supply system the whole qm staff will 
 have to learn new ways in acquiring 0:acquir 0:ing material for the battalion s various activities all of the sections 
 have been busy especially when dealing with the receipt of equipment that was used in kosovo as well as the 
 arrival of the new lav 111 thankfully the platoon was increased in strength and that made the workload easier to 
 handle overall despite several major changes the atmosphere amongst the platoon s soldiers continues to be excellent the road ahead 
 will be very busy but interesting as we plan on automating all of our procedures continuing with upgrade training and 
 supporting the battalion in their activities no you cannot get a rash like that from activities in the 1 ppcli

 it was subsequently known as the 50 day plan and saw the majority of 1 guards brigade units moved out 
 of drvar and into existing cantonment sites in the southern portion of canton 10 the move went extremely well and 
 once the entity armed forces 
 the patrician 2000 51 11l vp understood in no uncertain terms that the move was going to happen show cased 
 excellent cooperation between 1 guards brigade and the 3 ppcli battle group bn hq and administration company move with the 
 increase in size of the canadian area of operations that occurred at the end of roto 5 it became increasingly 
 clear to the battle group that the location of battle group headquarters and administration company in coralici was no longer 
 satisfactory the decision was quickly made to pursue the move and planning commenced at the end of april with the 
 first preparations beginning on 21 may within a six week period about 160 personnel 40 vehicles 167 accommodations and numerous 
 storage containers had been moved approximately 200 kilometers all while continuing 0:contin 0:uing normal operations and op barossa visit of 
 the cinc and the cor lady patricia general de chastelain and lord romsey visited the battle group at the end 
 of june to visit with the soldiers and share the bosnia experience with the battalion they also took this occasion 
 to present 0:pres 0:ent attachments to the 3 ppcli battle group with ppcli regimental coins on canada day they presented 
 sfor medals their stay with the battle group was rounded out with visits to all of the canadian camps and 
 lady patricia was the guest of honor at the re opening of a school near velika kladusa lady patricia s 
 visit was an honour for all members of the battle group and served to strengthen the great bond between her 
 and her regiment op restore faith this operation was triggered by a series of ethnic related violence that jeopardized the 
 secure environment of the glamoc opstina the destruction of several cafes the burning of a barn and other incidents of 
 direct intimidation were clearly a case of bosnian croat intimidation of the bosniac minority this situation combined with a clearly 
 corrupt mayor and ethnically influenced and biased local police led to the decision to deploy a bty and other battle 
 group assets in an enhanced state to glamoc in late august to re establish a safe and secure environment and 
 the confidence of the local population after a few weeks the number of troops in the area was scaled back 
 but the increased patrol posture continued through to the hand over with 2 ppcli in september 
 11l vp op warm hearth throughout the tour the battle group was actively involved in civilian military cooperation cimic operations 
 at all levels by the end of the tour the battle group managed the expenditure of approximately 220 000 from 
 various organizations including cida and dfid the majority 0:majori 0:ty of this money was spent by the cimic cell on 
 major repairs to schools and small businesses in the battle group s area of responsibility however all of the companies 
 were able to complete their own civil assistance projects near the end of the tour it became evident that due 
 to the many dpre returns in a company s area of operations there were many houses still in need of 
 repair for the winter with considerable effort the cimic cell sought additional money from cida the amount that was granted 
 was approximately 320 000 this money was spent entirely on the winterization of 85 houses in canton 10 of special 
 note was the fact that once the money was obtained the entire operation was based solely on the efforts of 
 soldiers at the section level it was the soldiers intimate and detailed knowledge of the areas that they patrolled that 
 allowed the money to be spent quickly and efficiently personnel from 3 ppcli ums participate in exercise in velika kladusa

 impressive was cpl di capua s fourth consecutive win of the mountain man competition capt troy neufeld at the completion

 tasks standards of their exercise from battle procedure to ambush and defence consisting normally of five to fourteen battle task 
 standards on a single report they have at least provided us with new laptops 0:lap 0:tops so we can do 
 the work both in the field and on the road the year has 59 the patrician 2000

 dundurn for a total seven weekends ex s as well there were five trips to the field in wainwright all 
 in three months with this much time away from home its no wonder that not too many people want to 
 come to mtsc the outlook for the new year is good the only trips away are to fort lewis for 
 one week in february and one two week period in march no shortage of volunteers for those trips missing some 
 of the wainwright winter is not hard to take one of the few perks of the job once finished we

 you have a scorecard the operations cell was kept very busy co ordinating the numerous 0:numer 0:ous training visits from 
 area units and the british army with the high point undoubtedly being the co ordination of the demolition of the 
 old water tower the tasking cell sgt danser spent the year frantically moving personnel 0:per 0:sonnel around to fill the 
 incremental staff brique and somehow managed to find solutions to the problems that arose on an hourly basis the individual

 vp french grey battalion combat training centre cfb gagetown the infantry school experienced what was easily one of the busiest 
 and more productive years in recent memory the school received heaps of well deserved praise for their efforts in the 
 year 2000 praise that was earned through the contributions of serving french grey battalion members and the dozens more patricias 
 of all ranks sent to assist as course staff granted every unit endeavoured to support our requests for augmentation it 
 was the first battalion s contribution of instructors that put us over the top in fulfilling the summer slate of 
 officer training their recent experiences as part of the battle group on roto 0 in kosovo also served to provide 
 a fresh perspective on the methods used to train soldiers and provided food for thought on ways to streamline it 
 all told patricias helpec to train over one thousand officers and ncms in a yen busy year here at the 
 infantry school wha exactly gets done at the school and why do you need help from us are two common 
 questions 0:ques 0:tions asked by augmentees upon arrival however by the time they leave they have a pretty good idea 
 why they were sent and why their presence was so appreciated take last year s slate of courses as an 
 indication of what patricias contributed 0:con 0:tributed to with regards to officer training we ran 1 x reso a complete

 years here capt weber s personal pt regimen proved fruitful as he landed a position at dhtc capt jasper left 
 a noticeable void as he packed up his mountain bike and custom built monster jeep and headed for the third

 wo meir advanced recce from the third rounding out the contribution of ncos were wo clancy and mcpl camilerri in 
 keeping with tradition patricias at the school paid tribute to regimental day with a high spirited game of broom a 
 100 complete with end to end action that saw both young and old take their best shots or at least 
 get their shots in in the end there could only be one winner the ncos whom incidentally did so with 
 the help of an outsider some would even say that it was the crafty play of wo verch that backstopped 
 the nco team to victory another tradition that could not be organized in time for the fall 2000 was the 
 french grey cup game but have no doubt that the new year will be witness to so good old fashioned 
 officer nco football the newly appointed colonel of the regiment general de chastelain was on hand this summer to witness 
 the ctc graduation parade more importantly was the privilege bestowed among more than a dozen phase graduates who had the 
 privilege of receiving their cap badges from the colonel of the regiment in a small ceremony prior to the parade 
 two graduates of special note were lt formerly wo mcconnechy and lt formerly sgt barry who commenced a different chapter 
 in their careers by returning to their battalions to take up positions as qualified mechanized platoon commanders shortly after the 
 summer the officer ranks added some speed and cunning to their broom a 100 line up with the commissioning of 
 wo jenkins to lt we ended the year with a week dedicated to fostering a solid working relationship between all 
 ranks by bringing the staff closer together through a variety of sporting activities professional development training and social engagements the 
 annual men s christmas dinner was the venue for a few special events for patricias firstly was the retirement of 
 cpl mckillop who had been the longest serving member of the french grey battalion he retired after 24 years of 
 service the last fourteen plus having been served at ctc gagetown and will undoubtedly be missed as one of the 
 patricias everyone knew here at the school secondly were the promotions of cpls brocklebank and mclver to mcpl the holidays 
 were well deserved and this time we actually enjoyed it without having to worry about any interruptions caused by bugs 
 everyone keep in touch and remember that we are more than eager to host fellow patricias here at the school

 our last ottawa update has it what can we possibly put in this year to capture your interest 0:inter 0:est 
 service in ottawa lacks many of those things that would keep you from wanting to read our article we don 
 t have the annual french grey classic to tell you about similarly we don t have the broom i loo 
 games either nor do we have any wainwright exercise stories to pass on so soldiers and civilians alike gather at 
 lgen reays memorial in christ church in ottawa lgen reay was killed in a car accident while working in the 
 former yugoslavia what could we possibly have to say to capture your interest well what we do have is a 
 tremendous range of seasoned patricias who were once serving alongside most of you in the battalions and most of us 
 are itchin to be back there as well what changes have we witnessed there were many on the promotion front 
 we saw the following promotions bgen vince kennedy lcol mike day maj greg burton and capt fred curson newly posted

 ottawa is the proximity of some of our most senior appointments and distinguished personalities in 
 68 the patrician 2000 vp leaving his position as the colonel of the regiment we have still been proud to 
 have mgen hewson and his wife norah keep a close eye on us when his busy timetable permits we are 
 also blessed with the attendance of our new colonel of the regiment gen de chastelain and his wife mary ann 
 no commentary on senior distinguished personalities in the ottawa area would be complete without mention of one of our former 
 colonels of the regiment col suds sutherland and his wife helen in fact a ppcli association certificate of merit presentation 
 to col suds served as the backbone to one of our gatherings the event was all the more special since 
 maj retd rod middleton came all the way out from calgary to be on hand for this one another benefit 
 of service in ottawa is the extremely strong ties we enjoy with our association members we have also gone out 
 of our way to embrace into our ranks all those who served by our sides as maint os qms sig

 were all tremendously saddened with the loss of lgen gord reay at the end of the year he touched many 
 of us throughout his career and had a tremendous impact on most of us we share in the loss with 
 his wife lesley and son brendan a moving testimonial to his popularity across the military was the turnout at his 
 memorial service here in ottawa about 700 strong we celebrate his life and soldier on as he would have wanted 
 us to do and one last word if you hear you re posted to ottawa don t give up on 
 pt about once a month we have the infamous regimental gathering where col peter kenward takes us out for a 
 jog it s somewhat of a sprint and followed by you guessed it lots of push ups and sit ups 
 incentive to come out and participate is the obligatory mess gathering thereafter where we get to nurse our wounds so 
 if it s great camaraderie you re after don t forget the ottawa crowd and bring your running shoes we 
 wish you well in all your endeavours and hope our paths cross soon kingston ere patricia s another year has 
 passed and we have seen friends depart and in their place a raft of new patricias have emerged the changes

 schooley said as he introduced himself i remembered the night but i don t know how i became rescued added 
 mowry an active volunteer and fund raiser who still uses the aid of a cane because of his wound i 
 do not remember fred or much else i recall the shelling shooting and shouting and being hit i remember bits 
 and pieces of evacuation to hospital 0:hospi 0:tal in japan schooley recalled the events which brought him to mowry s 
 side in october 1952 a baker company patrol passed through our c company going out to bunker hill schooley remembered 
 about an hour later we received a call the patrol was hit and we had to go out and retrieve 
 the dead and wounded we went out and started to pack them in that is where i met lew mowry 
 as myself and a man by the name of wilmot carried lew out the next time i met lew was

 it s hard to remember shelled shot at hit in the leg all kinds of racket the evening scene was 
 vivid in schooly s mind there were about eight or nine wounded he said about 18 or 20 of us 
 were told you and you were sent out it wasn t hard to find our way we had been out 
 on these patrols many times too it took about five or six field dressings to cover lew s wound from 
 the back of his heel to well above his knee i broke off the glass over a needle and stuck 
 lew to help kill the pain we loaded him on the stretcher and carried him about a mile and a 
 half back past bunker hill to charlie company cp command post the events of the night were not as clear 
 in mowry s memory i remember being scared with the gawd dammed pain or whatever waiting to be picked up 
 mowry recalled of his evacuation it seemed like a lifetime kinda remember going through charlie company i must have been 
 flown to the hospital in japan it was gawd dammed rough i was pretty drugged up i don t remember 
 leaving korea schooley continued to share his side of the story the odd shell came in while we were out 
 there he described on our way back we came across a wounded radio operator walking back we patched up his 
 sucking shoulder wound and convinced him to be carried back in another stretcher bunker hill schooley explained was where there 
 were many american casualties the americans occupied the outpost when they held the particular sector which was one of the 
 reasons why canadians left bunker hill unoccupied mowry remains grateful to schooley it s great to meet the guy who

 the past months giving thanks for good friends and the opportunity to be a strong witness in the community upholding 
 the proud traditions of the patricia s the edmonton branch maintains a high level of participating members 64 regular 31 
 associates with a monthly meeting of 35 40 regular attendees the willingness of our members to serve on committees or 
 help at special events is gratifying and is much appreciated by the executive two dinners are held annually the first 
 commemorating frezenburg and the second is a special christmas gathering members are encouraged to invite friends and relatives and there 
 is usually a good representation from the garrison during these occasions he have managed 0:man 0:aged to donate substantial funds 
 raised by raffles to such charities as the christmas bureau the salvation army and the mewburn veteran s centre as 
 with every aspect of life change happens and we would like to note the departure of mrs mickey mccannel to 
 newfoundland chic ethel query to oliver 8 c herb taylor to lethbridge 8 c and a more final farewell to 
 jim waniandy to which we dedicated this years frezenberg dinner the edmonton branch is privileged to be located so close 
 to the ppcli rhq two of the three battalions and the old battle school as we are able to attend

 ist bn presentation and consecration of new colours held june 24 during the same ceremony mgen hewson signed over command 
 as the cor to gen dechasteline which was attended by the colonel in chief another highlight for a few of 
 our members was an afternoon tea held at the edmonton garrison wos and sgts mess on the 8h of september 
 which was attended by una travis and patricia munro to conclude we invite all visitors to attend any of our 
 meetings these are always held the 4th friday of the month jasper place legion 102 aye 156 st 11 30

 the patrician 2000 91 okanagan thompson branch the okanagan thompson branch extends from hefley creek in the north to oliver 
 in the south a distance of about 300 kilometres which presents quite a challenge to many of our members driving 
 on highway 97 when the weather becomes nasty as a result attendance at meetings becomes pretty slim during the winter 
 months at present our membership stands at 35 regular and 15 associates we regret the loss of one patricia bill 
 dechant who passed away in january attendance at our luncheon on 17 march regimental day was very disappointing but the 
 faithful members 0:mem 0:bers approved the purchase of a building block in memory of the deceased members of the branch 
 on 25 april the kap yong memorial was celebrated by a gathering at the patricia way cairn at the vernon 
 army camp attended by members of the ppcli and korea veterans associations followed by luncheon at the spallemcheen golf and

 at our friendly local restaurant we dedicated the dinner and the evening in felix carrier s name since several of 
 us had just got back from his funeral in surrey it was a good dinner followed by what has become 
 our normal after dinner routine on these occasions that is a joke telling time that is led by two of 
 our skilled story telling ladies these are liz brown and joey ellis they invariably have a stock of funny stories 
 to tell that keeps the members laughing and helping the digestion of their just completed dinner the next two months 
 went by with our usual regular meetings march brought our next occasion the 17th march once again our dependable crew 
 of helpers purchased produced and presented both the food and suitable decorations for the event we even had some out 
 oftown 0:out 0:of 0:town pickley visitors join us to help celebrate the appropriate toasts for the occasion may took us 
 to the branch agm and the annual elections these were relatively painless this time around as all the incumbents volunteered 
 to stay in place for another year that left us with mcl canfield as president marc gagne as vice president 
 peggy hart as recording secretary grouch grouette as treasurer and bill wilkinson as sgt atarms 0:sgt 0:at 0:arms colour bearer 
 and keeper of the branch colours he even washes 0:wash 0:es and irons them when necessary erika has him well 
 trained because the wos and joes have their annual get together in june and some people take off travelling immediately 
 thereafter may is also our wind up meeting for the year as some of our members tend to 
 93 the patrician 2000 do some drove clear back to the east coast and back again this usually makes for 
 a thin meeting in september because some members are still finding their way back to the wet coast october normally 
 brings everyone out to our meeting while we prepare for armistice day and our december dinner again joey and liz 
 of course have been collecting and saving good jokes for our christmas dinner so our branch can wind up another 
 year in an appropriate manner vancouver branch the branch started their year off with the annual general meeting where the 
 members agreed the executive were doing a good job and could therefore remain in place to the end of their 
 second year on sunday march 19 2000 we met in the anderson room of the seaforth armory for our annual 
 regimental day luncheon though our turnout was down from the year before we still had a very successful day with 
 36 members present we held a raffle through the generous donations 0:dona 0:tions of several members we also gained two 
 new members at this event thanks to jim shaw generously donating back the door prize a bottle of glenfiddich tumblers

 holland won the second 0:sec 0:ond raffle and kept it for tom for an easter gift lucky tom in june 
 our president don urquhart and his wife jenny attended the annual general meeting of the national association in victoria several 
 other members attended as well where they saw our own member donald don parr pearson receive the certificate of merit 
 from major general c w hewson omm cd it was a well deserved honour 0:hon 0:our for a member who 
 out a lot of hard work into the branch plus the special project involving the placing of a plaque at 
 the walter mackay draycott memorial in time for lady patricia s visit in july 1999 well done don don parr 
 pearson receiving his award from mgen hewson at the end of august we held our annual bbq at the home

 with award giving acceptance j speech we finished the year with a total 66 members john notschke frank norris and 
 ron bracey passed away 2 new members joined and 2 members returned to the branch so we are basically staying 
 stable but as the membership ages it is harder for people to get out to the events the executive president 
 don urquhart vice president tom holland secretary treasure thelma holland directors at large don parr pearson glenn palmer and don 
 boyce thank the members for their help over the last two years and wish the new executive much success in 
 the coming term victoria branch the branch millennium year got off to the same start as most years with the 
 first event being the annual general meeting on the 29th of january in the face of the usual competition nil 
 the branch executive remains the same with the exception of our new treasurer larry davies who took over from our 
 long serving jac de bruijne as in the past two years we held our regimental birthday dinner at the langford 
 legion where harry groom and his staff did their usual excellent job of catering for us the national agm held 
 here in june went according to plan but dealing with unionized establishments is a far cry from the good old 
 days of the work point sergeants mess two major events held here in september while not strictly regimental activities saw 
 large numbers of ex patricia s attending the 
 the patrician 2000 95 first held on the 15th of the month was a candlelight tribute to veterans held in 
 the esquimalt military cemetery it was a perfect evening and almost all ex military veterans organisations in the region were 
 represented since it was a dva and cf sponsored event it was well organised but marred by overlong speeches by 
 too many dignitaries who wanted to get in on the act ex patricia and legion stalwart roy aylesworth did the 
 honours as sergeant at arms and brian vernon represented the peacekeeping veterans 0:veter 0:ans the weather held out fine the 
 next morning on the 16th when the bc lieutenant governor garde gardom presented peacekeeping service medals on the lawn of 
 the legislator eligible members of the regiment were out in force to get their gong many like myself find it 
 a little ironic to get two medals in retirement after long regular service in which many of us were awarded 
 just two never having been shot at i wear mine with a slightly guilty pride but not like the snooty 
 guards officer who said of a veteran 0:vet 0:eran he was never a real soldier he was only in during
