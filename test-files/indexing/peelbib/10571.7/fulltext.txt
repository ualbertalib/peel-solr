 41 from the editor s dugout it was quite a shock the other day when on idly turning the dial 
 of a friend s borrowed radio a familiar scrap of tune made itself heard jungle bells it brought home the 
 fact rather forcibly that the hole in a certain over size stocking kept for ohimney hanging purposes must be darned 
 and the mothballs 0:moth 0:balls removed from the uniform of santa claus the season of jap oranges free cigars and 
 impossible neck ties has rolled round again a reminder that there is no time like the present to take stock 
 of the year 1935 and its activities there has been a certain amount of training of course indeed this year 
 has been a good one for that the members of the machine gun mechanized platoon in particular were grateful for 
 their stay at shilo as it permitted them to do more tactical training and field firing than has fallen to 
 their lot in recent years in fact all those of the winnipeg station found the experience most beneficial b company 
 did not have their pilgrimage to comox this year but got in some good training at real s range in 
 june and july while from both stations good representations were sent to the small and other courses at sarcee camp 
 alberta in sports the winnipeg contingents have held their own well and made a good showing in all the leagues 
 to whioh they gained an entry i t ssquimalt t b t company has also had some good sport in 
 the inter platoon leagues but in the outside leagues has not been so successful it is due in part at 
 least to the absence of a number of the personnel at sarcee during the best part of the summer a 
 condition which is inseperable from training requirements the answer seems to be train the recruits and build teams on the 
 men who are likely to be at home while the league gamos are being played steps are being taken in 
 this direction now and cannot bo too heartily commended the year has seen a goodly increase in our strength on 
 both stations the new influx should bring much material which with a little coaching and training will increase our prowess 
 no less on the sports field than elsewhere it is a pleasure to see the new feces on parade and 
 there is no doubt but that their owners will do us proud this year the regiment came of ago on 
 august 10th a date which means so much to us all it is unfortunate that our birthday occurred in the 
 midst of tho season of camps and 
 42 schools preventing the holding of a suitable celebration however the patricia s are not unmindful of the record which 
 has been built up during those twenty one years nor of the obligations 0:obliga 0:tions which it lays upon those 
 who must carry it on on another page appears a poem the maples by hugh l maurice a former member 
 of b company and well known to many in both stations of the regiment the sentiment expressed in this poem 
 is particularly appropriate to remembrance day and was inspired by the many beautiful maples at fulford harbour on 3altspring island 
 the patrician reprints this poem with acknowledgments to the victoria colonist in a recent issue of which the maples appeared 
 in view of the prominence given everywhere in these days to the suez canal and its environs corporal morrison is 
 right in thinking that the time is appropriate to record the impressions which that famous ditch made on one member 
 of the regiment these impressions will be found on page 57 of this issue before the seal is put on 
 the last patrician for 1935 the editorial staff wish to thank all the contributors who have helped to make our 
 publication possible and to express to all our readers everywhere the earnest hope that the coming festive season may be 
 the merriest of their lives and the new year brim full of joy happiness and good luck a very merry 
 christmas to you one and all yours faithfully our contemporaries the following journals were received during the last quarter the

 a a a a t t t t t t t t t t r t t r t t 
 t t t at eleven o clock a m on the eleventh of november was celebrated the anniversary of a 
 great event in every city and hamlet of our dominion the daily activities ceased and people gathered in their publio 
 places to do honour to the memory of a glorious moment in the history of the world as the signal 
 came sharp on the hour and all the familiar noises of ur everyday life ceased and silence reigned supreme many 
 of those standing with bared heads before the sculptored memorials to our departed heroes must have recalled a morning seventeen 
 years before when in a like sudden and unaccustomed silence that fell over the fields of france and belgium upon 
 their senses broke the realization that the war was really over at last to others it recalled tho mad ringing 
 of the bells here at home as the news was flashed around the world the wild celebrations in every land 
 the end of four long years of war to many too it brought a sadder memory of loved ones who 
 did not live to know the end of the battles they fought or who returned byt wrecks of their former 
 selves and yet is not the most real and lasting remembrance of this day the knowledge that with a real 
 hatred of war and all the sufforing that it must bring in its wake our men and women too were 
 ready to make any sacrifice for the defence of the things most dear to them no demand was too heavy 
 no effort was too great when the land that they loved and the ideals in which they believed were in 
 danger of violation and destruction 0:destruc 0:tion we gather thus to do honour to the memory of those who gave 
 their lives in the struggle for our own liberty and no less to remind ourselves that the spirit of that 
 sacrifice is not nor ever will be dead within us believing in justice and liberty for all mankind and in 
 man s inalienable right to fashion his own destiny wo are prepared to guard this heritage and preserve it for 
 those who will come after us in victoria the ceremony was held in parliament square before a crowd of several 
 thousand citizens many hundreds of war veterans were on parade under the command of lieut general sir peroy h n

 44 the activities 0f a company winnipeg commencing the ist of september a company was busy training and getting reader 
 for a physical training display and this i believe will be dealt with under sports from winnipeg since the last 
 issue of the patrician a company has returned to fort osborne barracks and is now settling down to the winter 
 programme of training as will be noticed in previous issues some of the trained men have left to take up 
 civilian employment and at the latter end of august and continuing up to the resent time we have been recruiting 
 a3 a result the air is filled with right turn one two and so on the recruits that have been 
 attested 0:attes 0:ted and posted to a company during the last three months are as follows pte buxton j benzie

 at this time we would like to wish good luck to captain m isbester m c on his recent appointment 
 as d a a q m g military district no 10 and also to 5 m 1 w 0 1 
 e scrutton who retired on pension last month mr scrutton if you happen to read this issue of the patrician 
 we in a company would like you to know that we all do appreciate the many ways in which you 
 have helped us and all do most sincere and heartily send you our best wishes pte e finnic has decided 
 to try his luck with civilian life and well here s to you finnie by the time this goes to 
 press sgt r a agar will have retired on pension and we wish him luck but bob when the company

 your rifles until you get your ammunition not to say anything of the various puns cheerio bob and keep smiling 
 a sgt stoddart l g and pte bernent v have at last attained that select coterie known as the married 
 establishment the furlough season is in full swing in winnipeg and we have the start of the snow and that 
 means snow fatigues and a certain amount of curtailment in the activities of the trained men but it also means 
 skating and hockey which means me so cheerio for the time being notes from machine gun mechanized platoon after the 
 unit training at shilo camp the platoon was split up between shilo sarcee and winnipeg the few men left in 
 barracks were attached to a company and the platoon as a unit did not function until the end of august 
 our students at a and b wings and the range takers course at the small arms school did very well 
 sgt f h jackson and pte munro h g received q l on a wing and cpls

 f h taylor t e and pte taylor g s received q l on b wing l cpl mckay w 
 a and ptes chase w h and hughes w w received instructor s certificates on the infantry rangefinder oil august 
 ist our platoon commander major j h carvosso m c left with mrs carvosso for two month s holiday at 
 the coast when he arrived back we think that he wished that his leave could have been extended for another 
 month at least the first part of september was devoted to training a squad for the physical training display which 
 was held on the 18th the display was a success only marred by a rather serious injury to pte black 
 h w he is still in the general hospital but will soon be back at the station hospital and to 
 the platoon we all sincerely hope after the p t artists finished astounding the public the furlough season began and 
 the barrack rooms assumed a deserted appearance according to the best authorities the time to do such things as interior 
 decorating spring cleaning and such like is in the spring but the m g platoon evidently does not stand on 
 convention about a week ago two stalwarts of the platoon armed with brushes step ladders and pails and both wearing 
 a look of grim determination started in to decorate the barrack room it was not long before the room assumed 
 the appearance of having been used for a mack sennett pie slinging scene the decorators had to orient themselves once 
 in a while by the parade square to make sure that they t rere kalsomining the ceiling and not the 
 floor after much salvaging of kits moving of beds and general disorder which ensued during the next few days the 
 room was finally finished with sighs of relief from everyone it will be some time i think before we will 
 be able to give them a certificate as interior decorators but if they keep on they should be due about 
 the time that they go on pension captain l m black m c has returned to the fold after six 
 years at the coast where he was for several years with b company and latterly on the staff at headquarters 
 military district no 11 we wish to welcome him to the platoon to which he has been posted from the 
 ist october cpl miller g e left for fort francis ont on the sth november to conduct a provisional school 
 of signals this is his first school and we wish him the best of luck cpl morton d g is 
 assisting on the royal school of infantry we hear he is having quite a time on the l a 
 47 sergeants mess dear mr editor once upon a tine that is hou all fairy ta4 es start i stood 
 in the role of spectator watching a polcer game and as the moments grew tense i observed a certain gentleman 
 holding four kings throw a dollar in the pot on the other side of the table looking as innocent as 
 his name sgt bliss holding four aces and inwardly repeating to himself the story of the spider and the ely 
 said come again now mr editor as i have not received any uncomplimentary remarks from you so far for my 
 last contribution to your paper do i take it for granted that you would like me to come again not 
 i hope with the same purpose in view as had the holder of the four aces since last writing to 
 you several changes and interesting events have taken place amongst us sgt carnegie has been appointed to the instructional cadre 
 and we have welcomed to the mess sgts jackson and pengelly on promotion from corporal on 31st august we were 
 delighted to receive a visit from s m i and mrs j crawford of saskatoon accompanied by their two charming 
 daughters jack as he is known by all the older hands talked over old times with old friends after which 
 we adjourned to be the guests of r s m and mrs mcculloch who proved themselves admirable hosts the visitors 
 leaving for the west the following morning our commanding officer favoured us with a visit on the occasion of a 
 social evening given in honour of s m i e scrutton sgt r a agar and sgt p mcgarry and 
 in a rather witty speech spoke of the good service given by each of the departing guests time marohes on 
 is an old slogan and as that march continues progress is made along all lines and in the great advance 
 of science the army of today has kept its place for in digging into my much neglected greek history i 
 find that at troy they had one wooden horse whereas in fort osborne barracks we have three and congratulations to 
 q m 5 1 harper for the way he had those boys go over them on the 18th september to 
 speak of wooden horses wooden is a word taken from the egyptian meaning made of lumber it was really coined 
 to combat the greek song of that age maid of athens on the 19th september was held what was known 
 as the first annual sergeants mess golf tourney the members assembled in 
 48 the mess at nine o l clook that morning prior to driving out to deer lodge course as the 
 writer mingled with the company he fancied he could hear coming down the corrid rs of time the distant footsteps 
 of jacob and his family now israel loved joseph more than all his other children and he made him a 
 coat of many colours there must have been quite a lot of daddy s favourites at deer lodge that day 
 reminded me of a radio programme i used to hear rainbow revue well off they went not a paradox amongst 
 them paradox is taken from the latin word parado meaning teetotal golfer the mess was the scene of a gala 
 evening following the competition 0:competi 0:tion the cup being presented to the inner sgt clifford i am sure we were 
 all pleased to see him catch that event as a provost sergeant i believe it was the only thing he 
 ever caught staff sgt greenley from regina was a visitor on that occasion and old memories were revived as several 
 vocal numbers were rendered by an old quartette of by gone days messrs greenley gunn roberts and reading they were 
 indeed four staunch brethren though the quartette takes its name from the cistern sgt jerry deßochie is on holiday in 
 new mexico it has been whispered that he is following up the royal american shows our esteemed provost sergeant sgt 
 clifford has retired on pension keyholes will now be used for keys only jack was the recipient of a lovely 
 clock from his mess mates prior to his departure to civilian life he is now giving of his best to 
 the hudson s bay company sgt clifford was born in the array and no doubt his going was quite a 
 wrench i have met him several times since and he tells me that he really prefers civilian 0:civ 0:ilian life 
 but as i left him i seemed to hear something whisper in my ear the voice is the voice of 
 jacob but the hand is the hand of esau the mantle of clifford has fallen on a real g man 
 sgt dunn is oarrying on the work of provost sergeant in order that it might be fulfilled which was spoken 
 of the prophet saying and a crook shall they sit in an high place for none better knoweth the way 
 of the evil doer which being interpreted means set a crook to catch a crook well mr editor the day 
 is far spent across the snowcovered 0:snow 0:covered prairie shadows are lessening the wintry sun slowly dips behind the horizen 
 and its last lingering rays are swallowed up in the clouds of the oncoming night overhead a flock of geese 
 honk as they wing their way southward tennyson s evening star appears on her lonely watch and as the gftese 
 disappear into tho encircling gloom the short lived twilight of manitoba ends abruptly it is night 
 49 a few years ago mr editor when all the world was young lad and every tree was green i 
 was taught along lines something 0:some 0:thing like this work while it is yet day for the night cometh when 
 no man can work so you will pardon me if i use that earlier teaching as an excuse to put 
 aside my pen with this letter goes our best wishes to our comrades beyond the rockies and while we remember 
 them we also remember those who though havi lg hung up their equipment are still our friends we feel sure 
 that many of them are resident on the shores of the pacific end a line from them at any time 
 would be appreciated you may break you may shatter the vase if you will but tho scent of the uosa 
 will hang round it still in closing please allow me to add my personal greetings and good wishes to you 
 your company and your paper and if it is our lot to meet at sarcee camp in the coming year 
 with you i ll drain the modest cup ignite with you the mild havana and we will sing while drinking 
 up yes we have no bannanna sincerely optimist 11 band notes the regimental band continues to be actively engaged particularly 
 during tho last couple of months engagements fulfilled include the follo lng the manitoba teachers convention 0:conven 0:tion back to 
 the land association winnipeg tribune young men s section of the board of trade and others too numerous to mention 
 here once again old man winter is upon us and this season the band resumes the series of weekly educational 
 programmes given in the schools in and around winnipeg manj r letters are received by captain james from both teachers 
 and scholars expressing pleasure at having heard these programmes it is the desire of the school board to develop in 
 the children an understanding and appreciation of music and the band are glad to be able to do their part 
 in this good work on november 11th the band acted as duty band at the civic auditorium where a service 
 was held commemorating the war dead following the service there was a march past of all units in the winnipeg 
 garrison the salute being taken by brigadier j l gordon d f c district officer commanding military distriot no 10 
 at the cenataph 
 50 tho band lost a yer valuable and popular member recently in sgt peto mcgarry d c m who has 
 repaired to the old country on pension according to letters received from him he is having quite a happy carefree 
 time in his native liverpool sx cpl alii eon our former very efficient drummer left winnipeg recently for tho east 
 we take this opportunity to thank mr allison for generously helping the band last summer on many engagements and hope 
 that his future will be happy and prosperous looking up the files we discover that several key men will be 
 leaving for civilian life shortly including bandsman h barrington solo oboe bandsman h swift solo cornet and our well known 
 solo saxophonist and tenor corporal hill perhaps you ve heard him sing this gradual exodus is rather alarming to those 
 of us who are staying on to complete our allotted time and rr e apprehensively hope that we shall be 
 able to enlist gome really first class men to take their places and keep the band as efficient as it 
 always has been we are happy to inform our many readers that despite tho sad vicissitudes of life mike toohey 
 continues to bear up with remarkable equanimity he gets a great kick out of pop eye the sailorman yo ho

 vi x j is v j j x i x v i x vi gas at the very sound of 
 the word we start an involuntary 0:involun 0:tary rummaging in our left side pocket as though expecting to find as 
 mask pardon respirator still a part of our regular equipment that one magic word is all that is necessary to 
 transport us back to sarcee camp and the joys of the last week of august 1935 it started well we 
 were moved from tents into huts lovingly known as the pig sty and the bower which was in itself a 
 great event considering the unfriendly antics of the thermometer in the small hours of the morning too it is in 
 the huts that one has the best chance in the world to study the vagaries of one s fellow men 
 of absorbing interest becomes the not altogether academic study of one person s taste for a generous supply of fresh 
 air while sleeping in contrast to another s preference for seclusion from the entire outer world during the same time 
 also as someone remarked it gives the windows exercise we learn many things among thorn being how innocent a syllabus 
 may look before you start it how much can be accomplished 0:accom 0:plished in one week what a splendid bed 
 follow a respirator got it right that time makes what ch 2 ch 2 ci 2 s tear gas to 
 you feels like at two o clock a m or p m and many other useful and interesting things it 
 was really a most pleasant course and wo were all sorry when it finished as the anti gas course finished 
 and our weary instructors settled back into their berths for a restful trip eastward more willing victims arrived from both 
 winnipeg and the coast and tho junior officers tactical training was on long and loud were the battles that raged 
 about sarcee during the next two weeks it has been said somewhere was it in ono of the manuals that 
 no two military situations are alike nor is the approach to a problem the same for any two people verily 
 it is a mighty truth they might have added that no two solutions are alike indeed wo came to think 
 of that as a sort of law whether on the sand table or on the ground every problem devised by 
 the hard working d s provided occasion for truly noble exhibitions of rugged canadian individuality on all sides not that 
 we failed to agree oh noi when tho tumult and the shouting died there wore surprisingly few minority reports while 
 every brought to each problem an open mind and several books and while he came fully cognizant of tho ultimate 
 omnipotence 0:omnipo 0:tence of his own arm nevertheless he could meet his collogues in that spirit of co ope ration 
 which we arc told wins all battles 
 58 differences in minor points yes the merits and faults of platoon positions fifty yards apart furnished the themo of 
 many an animated discussion and we suspect the source of much amusement to tho d s while ten foot either 
 way in tho placing of a lewis gun became a matter for delicate arbitration by neutral powers of course the 
 difficulty as to discover any strictly neutral powers by the end of the two weeks practically every nation on tho 
 face of the earth was at war including thoso mighty peoples northland southland eastland 17 cstland rodlana blueland aberhartia and 
 several others of note as well as an assortment of canine heroes estimated at about twelve perhaps the greatest benifit 
 from the course consisted in working with officers of other arms of the service and in getting something of their 
 viewpoint on various tactical quostions 0:quost 0:ions which constantly re occur it makes for a more complete understanding of how 
 the army as a whole fights and cannot fail to result in more intelligent co operation between all arms our 
 only complaint again is that this course was much too short v ere it hold at a time of year 
 when it could be extended for another week at least wo feel that we should get just that proportion of 
 extra good from tho time spent the company parade state with all due respect to qld sergeant majors tho company

 60 from port said to suez by corporal l c morrison port said gateway to the far east i shall 
 never forget ray first glimpse of it i was a boy at the time barely seventeen a young musician serving 
 with the band of an imperial regiment on my way to india it happened early on a beautiful sunday morning 
 the sea was calm with hardly a ripple and we were lolling around on the deck either reading swopping yarns 
 or indulging in a little flutter on the jolly old crown and anchor a game of chance inseparably 0:insepar 0:ably 
 associated with all british troopships after the rather rough passage through the famous bay of biscay when mountainous waves broke 
 over the decks we found this smooth sailing quite a pleasant relief our boat the s s china one of 
 the fastest vessels owned by the p 0 company nosed her way gracefully through the blue of the mediterranean leaving 
 in her wake a widening ribbon of white foam over which flew a flock of sea gulls the sun was 
 hot but we wore our topees and the faint salt breeze cooled our cheeks suddenly there came a cry land 
 in sight hastily we abandoned everything and hurried to the ship s rails it was land alright but very vague 
 like an inky smudge against the horizon port said how excited we were of course we had sighted land before 
 during the voyage out from england the coast of spain morocco c ibraltar but this was different those countries we 
 had seen only from a distance and gibraltar at night when we stopped for a few hours to send out 
 and pick up mail at port said we were scheduled to take on coal we would have a close up 
 view of both egypt and arabia would see the suez canal that wonderful y aterway dug through the heart of 
 the tropical desert no wonder we felt excited as is customary we held the usual divine service on board there 
 is something rather impressive about a service at sea particularly on such a beautiful morning as this around noon our 
 engines stopped and looking across the water we saw coming towards us a pilot boat flying the union jack it 
 drew alongside and there came on board several customs men wearing the egyptian fez after the ships papers had been 
 inspected we continued our journey 
 61 by this time port said was quite plainly soon ono couldn t help noting tho swam of shipping lying 
 at anchor in tho harbour ships of all nations r hcn an army transport goos through tho mon on board 
 aro charged about 3 a hoad and this naturally adds enormousto tho company s receipts war do tho shareholders view 
 tho possibility of war with alarm on the contrary war which knocks so many other stocks flat sends those of 
 the suez canal sky high the traffic and earnings of this company have far exoeeded the hope of oven do 
 lossops that courageous frenchman who first conceived tho idea and whose statue sbands at tho entrance of the groat ditch 
 which has so changed the shipping routes of tho world soon we wore dockod and the business of taking on 
 coal began and what a business no wonder wo had orders to keop the portholes closed there was dust everywhere 
 when i was there sixteen years ago it r as all done by hand labour doubtless the system has since 
 been improved but at this time a seemingly endless procession of dirty half naked arabs filed up the gangway carrying 
 on their backs sacks or baskets of coal this they deposited in the chutes provided for that purpose returning to 
 the docks for more and what a din they made they argued pushed gesticulated 0:gesticul 0:ated and shouted in a 
 most unintelligible jargon two of thorn started a regular set to instantly the troops became animated 0:anim 0:ated and cheered 
 lusty encouragement to both contestants presently one hit the other on the noso blood flowed looking rather odd red against 
 black the excitement did not last long however two stalwart dock police arrived on the scene and after a struggle 
 succeeded 0:succee 0:ded in separating the warriors and the bout came to an end much to our chargrin the verdict 
 was a draw so those of us who had wagered bets on the issue got our monoy back we had 
 been hoping to go ashore but for some reason or other this privilege was denied us except for the officers 
 wo quite envied them particularly the old sweats whose eyes dwelt longingly on a sign not far distant advertising a 
 brand of egyptian boor unfortunately it was impossible due to the many sheds arc ho uses and other buildings on 
 the docks to get a very good view of the city itself little streets could be discerned beyond wo wore 
 considerably amused at the quaint oriental cafes with thoir arabic signs and tho strangely dressed natives passing up and down 
 the knowledge that port said has long been reputed to be tho wickedest and most dissipated city on the shipping 
 route from england to the far east accounted for our curiosity 
 62 there wore other diversions the naked little arab boys for instanoe who would dive into the water after pennies 
 thrown from the ship what clever divers they were i never saw one of them fail to retrieve a coin 
 small boats laden with fruit sweet meats souvenirs and picture post cards rowed by swarthy gentlemen in flowing oriental robes 
 drew alongside the steamer where their owners vociferously offered their wares for sale to make a purchase a small basket 
 containing the necessary money was lowered over the side of the ship the vendor removed the money substituted 0:substit 0:uted 
 the goods and the basket was hauled up again we pulled out from port said the same evening coaling was 
 over decks washed and we were on our way through the suez canal by the time darkness came we were 
 in the heart of the arabian desert to our mast head was fixed a powerful searchlight fed by a dynamo 
 on deck with another at our prow making our passage brighter the air was clear and the scenes were strange 
 and weird but very beautiful the tropic stars brighter than any i had ever seen in england made the velvet 
 oanopy of the heavens resplendent while a great round moon low hung seemed to change the famous canal into a 
 stream of molten silver this was egypt the land of pharaohs and ancient lore maybe we thought of the seductive 
 cleopatra making love to antony in the shadow of the pyramids closed our eyes and reenacted 0:re 0:enacted scenes from 
 the arabian nights in our imagination breathed the fragrant perfumes of the orient we could look over the silent wilderness 
 and occasionally discern silhouetted against the sky line a caravan of long legged camels with their wraith like riders bobbing 
 up and down under the moon during the night the suez port said train passed us it was a grand 
 sight with its illuminated windows and red sparks flying from its engines as it careered along the gleaming metals man 
 s ingenuity what would one of the pharaohs now lying peacefully in his sarcophagus have to say if he oould 
 only be brought to life again great ships in the middle of a desert fiery serpents speeding along miles of 
 sandy waste that once were impressed only by the feet of man and beast the trio through the canal is 
 very slow ships being allowed to proceed only at a speed of about six miles per hour now and again 
 we had tb tie up tf posts set along the sides of the canal the canal rules require that when 
 two ships meet one must stop and hug the bank until the other has passed by parts of the bank 
 are walled with stone to prevent sand 
 63 from falling in but despite this precaution dredges have to be kept working all the year round not far 
 from port said great steam pumps are continually sucking sand from the bottom of the canal and carrying it through 
 pipes far out over the desert guard houses are built at intervals along the waterway and towns have sprung up 
 where roads or railways cross the canal apart from these places we saw practically no signs of life sometimes a 
 lonely camel caravan trops across the desert now and again a flock of long legged cranes startled at the approach 
 of the steamer springs from the water into the air that is all dawn found us nearing suez a fairly 
 large seaport with several thousand europeans it is connected by train with port said and cairo as the sun grew 
 brighter away across the hot desert there looms up out of the sand a strange ship on other waters apparently 
 as real as the one in which we are travelling but we discover later that it is only a mirage 
 a mirage of the desert whioh so often deceives the thirsty traveller passing through as we approaoh it fades and 
 disappears like a veritable castle of the air the suez canal it was with almost a sigh of regret that 
 we left it behind and nosed our way into the red sea remembrance day i c if continued from page

 notes a number of new faces made their appearance in the two garrison teams this season the seniors made a 
 bad start losing their first two games since then however they have rapidly improved and despite a large number of 
 injuries succeeded in winning two and drawing one of their next three engagements at present they are making a strong 
 bid for the city championship the second team started the season with a bang owing however to injuries and the 
 necessity for drawing on this team to replace gaps in the senior ranks they lost their series with the navy

 at winnipeg p t and gymnastic display sixty picked men of the regiment took part in this display which was 
 staged on the parade square on the 18th september the physical training left nothing to be desired positions were good 
 and the training almost perfect the remarkable feature of the gymnastic work is the fact that men in such numbers 
 can reach such a peak of proficiency three vaulting horses were used with the six foot horse in the centre 
 half an hour of work on the apparatus left the audience weak from excitement it is not an idle boast 
 to say that the p p c l i horso team is the equal of any that has trained and 
 performed in canada this is the direct result of the interest and enthusiasm taken in this work by the commanding 
 officer combined with the excellent training given tho men by q k 5 1 j t harper a motion picture

 upon a time there were two bears who lived in a wire cage near the city park in a cold 
 cold place called by the natives winnipeg one day because their master was on relief and had only enough food 
 for his own family the bears were told that they would have to join their ancestors in the land of 
 many berries while their master was getting his gun buster and betty the two bears you know realising that discretion 
 was the better part of valour left via the broken gate route a great human cry ensued and a large 
 policeman entered fort osborne compound and enquired as to the whereabouts of the mighty marksman chief hittum bull our head 
 hunter dear readers cannot find enough to shoot at home and journeys forth to strange lands where dwell an elusive 
 animal called the pot this sport goes by the name of pot hunting but lady luck was not kind to 
 our mimrod in his recent wanderings thus when the large policeman informed him that he could boar hunt right in 
 his native surroundings 
 75 great was his joy ho took his guns both of them his telescope put on his stalking suit and 
 went forth to hont that bar by gar but alas tho bears must have smelled a rat because for hours 
 the hunt was not sucoessful eventually betty being very old and very hungry was found sitting up and begging before 
 a little boy for his lollipop 0:lolli 0:pop bang bang and another bruin bit tho dust but whore was buster 
 the hunt continued until our marksman 0:marks 0:man found himself in a small enclosed park as he paused for breath
