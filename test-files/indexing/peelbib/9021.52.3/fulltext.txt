 requested that rotary literature be written in observe and record businessmen and their the new languages his recommendations wives in
 many different cultures and led to an increase in the charter membership contexts maximum from 35 to over 50 because
 of the absenteeism caused by summer monsoons by this time james davidson was in failing health 4 he moved his
 family from calgary in the end davidson completed 2 200 one to vancouver and was unable to attend the hour
 interviews with prospective rotarians 1932 rotary international convention in and found less than a dozen disinterested in seattle instead his
 wife piesented her doing so he overcame indifference resistive account of the trip in his stead her attitudes and closed
 doors in all but two presentation in front of a huge map of the places after 32 months davidson was
 world was given with passion and successful in chartering 23 clubs in 12 sensitivity captivating the all male audience different
 countries her articles later were compiled into a book makiiug new friends 42 the davidsons arrived back in vancouver on
 march 21 1931 to a dinner attended by in 1932 davidson invited another calgary nearly six hundred people for davidson
 it rotarian doug howland to f ollow in his was the end of his third and last trip around far
 eastern footsteps between 1932 and the world this time having spent 250 000 1934 he succeeded in chartering 15 more
 of his own money including 32 000 in clubs in five countries in asia 43 together rotary advances 32 canadians
 davidson ralston and howland chartered a total of 47 clubs in 19 countries davidson journeyed to chicago in april to
 from athens to hong kong melbourne to report to the rotary international board on auckland karachi to nanking and in
 the success of the trip 4 in addition lillian canada from alberta to manitoba by 1933 davidson continued her popular
 articles in rotary clubs existed in 69 countries the rotarian which were gathering a worldwide audience serialized from 1930 james
 wheeler davidson died in vancouver to 1933 they revealed her latent talent to see on july 18 1933 among the
 flood of alberta history summer 2004 eulogies testimonials telegrams and tributes perhaps the most telling was the one given by
 the surgeon from fort william crawford mccullough former rotary president he has done a great service how great will perhaps
 never be measured and withal he is the most modest of men perhaps if rotary had gone searching she would
 never have found the militant apostle that she needed for successful work in the near and far east there are
 no other fellows that i know of just like jim davidson his personality is distinctly and entirely his own and
 it is an odd conglomerate seer politician showman adventurer writer philosopher incorrigible youth and modern go getter and it took
 his whole repertoire to succeed indeed i believe he succeeded where no one else could have in 1935 the alberta
 motor association and the rotary club of calgary requested that a prominent rocky mountain be named after davidson accepted by
 the canadian geographic names board the name did not reach the topographical maps until a transposition en or was discovered
 in 2002 mount davidson elevation 2 908 meters 9 575 feet is located nine kilometers north of the marker mountain
 the devils head or fifteen kilometers north of lake minnewanka and is visible for one hundu ed and sixty kilometers
 to the east davidson s life and times have been addressed by a book james wheeler davidson profile of a
 rotarian written by nt joseph of cochin india in 1987 stiniulated by his original research of rotary in india 45
 joseph met and formed a close bond with davidson s daughter marjory abi amson he also met lillian in 1972
 thi ee years before her death 42 what effect did spanning the world with rotary clubs have the epicentre of
 rotary has now moved toward asia and those countries in which davidson planted the rotary flag the foundation of rotary
