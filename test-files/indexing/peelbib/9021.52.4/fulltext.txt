 the demands of the umwa included violent labour union known as the western several sections related to wages that insured

 some of the material which lethbridge miners were also assured that was removed during the screening process although the canadian

 deputized as special constables 8 extra officers were brought in from the detachments at medicine hat and maple creek to
 help ensure order unbeknownst to the union a plainclothes officer constable gorski was assigned to infiltrate the european miners 7
 from the very beginning the union saw the increased police presence as an act of provocation and intimidation on the
 part of the company 7 the lethbridge strikers had good reason to be afraid the mounties had been put into
 service to break strikes in the past and in some cases had actually attacked strikers 27 the union publicly accused
 the rnwmp of entering the miners houses at number three and by their presence intimidating those foreigners who do not
 understand this is a free country and that no man needs work if he don t wish to 25 thus
 for the purpose of considering any matters rather than calming the situation the affecting their welfare 4 but he would

 position by the aftermath of the strike found the strikers agreeing to the insertion of a non back to work
 but not much better off than discrimination clause in which the they had been before the strike the mines company
 stated that all workers would be may have begun to operate again in treated the same regardless of union december
 of 1906 but miners had few of the affiliation 55 this effectively meant that protections that they had sought there
 was little benefit to union membership and that the benefits won by the strikers would be shared by non members

 stories current in this vicinity years ago regarding a party of white men who the indians said were mining at

 from hints thrown out by some of the blood and piegan indians it is generally supposed that they were murdered
 by the redskins who are now afraid to acknowledge having committed the crime at all events it is known that
 the miners worked there for some time and then suddenly disappeared and were never heard from again there are indians

 talent for writing only with the john e smith cut stone co through a lucky break in the height of
 the depression eva reid could not find work as in 1928 her sister lavina died and eva a stenographer so
 when a friend launching a returned to calgary it was during this time of small newspaper offered her a job
 she spiritual need that she became an active jumped at the chance she was hired as christian when speaking about
 her circulation manager but soon was pressed conversion years later she said that before into service editing copy conducting her
 sister s death like paul of old i took interviews and writing articles her true great delight in persecuting the
 christians i calling revealed she dedicated the rest of her rarely went to church and when i did it was
 long career to newspaper work juggling jobs merely to scoff but when she returned as diverse as provincial editor court
 reporter home to the broken family circle lavina s women s editor and social columnist when dying message left her
 in a state of bitter she finally retired after more than four rebellion which her father attempted to ease decades
 of writing about calgary social life by taking her to hear local evangelist william from bottom to top faithful readers
 quietly aberhart mourned and colleagues announced it as the end of an era aberhart who was also principal of crescent

 over cfcn reid in 1908 when eva was still a toddler radio with the financial support of a large john
 reid moved west purchasing two and loyal following in 1927 he had opened adjoining quarter sections of land in the
 the calgary prophetic bible institute as a hazelmere district five miles southeast of home base for his baptist church and
 a the little town of macleod training facility for bible students john reid was impressed with the man s dynamic
 by the early l 920 s the reid children had left preaching style and prophetic messages but the farm and
 moved to calgary there eva eva attended the church reluctantly at first attended high school and studied business at however
 over the course of several months mount royal college after her graduation she was touched by the kindness and spiritual
 in 1924 she quickly found work as a comfort offered by the abeiharts she started stenographer at big chief oil
 co but by to take notice of some of his more striking 1925 had moved on restless and eager for
 statements and began looking up scripture on above right this formal portrait of eva reid was taken about 1937 it
 was used as a staff photo while she was with the social credit chronicle n alberta history autumn 2004 her
 own actually taking fright at some eva never doubted the profound influence passages her conversion finally occurred that jessie exerted
 over her husband nor his after hearing aberhart preach a particularly religious sincerity she wrote whatever powerful sermon ye must
 be born again faults failures or besetting sins this man may have had i stoutly maintain hypocricy drawn to aberhart
 s religious message and to sic was not among them his god was very his wife s kindly mothering eva
 in 1929 real to him and no one ever has or could accepted the couple s invitation to board in
 convince me otherwise this sincerity their home at 2505 5 th street west in impressed eva deeply and she attributed
 to calgary with their two daughters grown the aberhart s example her decision to become a gregarious aberharts had welcomed
 a series devoted christian of young boarders into the lower level bedroom in their one and a half story hillside
 when eva moved in with the aberharts she home in the mission area forty years later was working as a
 typist at the general eva wrote a two part article in which she motors acceptance corporation but soon fondly recalled
 her fourteen months found herself unemployed when the residence in the house with the algebra company felt the effects of
 the worldwide fence treated more like a family member economic downturn and like so many than a paying boarder she
 joined the others at the time she found it very difficult aberharts for meals and entered into their to get
 another job with time on her hands daily lives jessie aberhart was a community and very little money she was
 easily minded social woman who welcomed her persuaded to fill her hours by attending free husband s associates and adherents
 classes at the prophetic bible institute her particularly young students from the bible curiosity had been aroused by the lively
 institute in addition to earnest debate eva dinner table discussions about religion recalled many good times with her hosts and
 conducted by aberhart and her conventional their friends there was laughter prayer anglican upbringing had proved no match story telling
 and jokes aplenty in the kitchen for the fervor and religious commitment she nook we made music and played games
 in witnessed in her new fundamentalist friends the elongated living room she started attending the newly formed bible she remembered
 william aberhart as a institute baptist church getting to know the serious minded man who worked long hours teen aged
 organist muriel preston muriel in his study and was demanding of himself who was a student at crescent heights high
 and others this i nan of letters was often school and a favourite of william aberhart s demanding short tempered
 impatient on occasionally visited the aberhart house occasion rude or sharp and sometimes i usually accompanied by her mother or
 other thought unreasonable but he was never young people from the church one of eva s cruel physically nor mentally
 to his family or fondest memories from this period involved fellow man to my knowledge on the young muriel and
 occurred one evening contrary he demonstrated a great love of when the aberharts were away from home family and i
 recall his glee when he could in temporary rebellion against the strict snatch an hour or two from a busy
 schedule baptist precepts that ruled the aberhart to join them in music and song he played household eva turned up
 the radio rolled the piano sometimes for guests but in the back the rug and taught a not too unwilling
 t living room he never took himself too muriel to dance guilt forced her later seriously and as jokes were
 exchanged his confession to aberhart of this and other infectious laugh could be heard through the forbidden indulgences such as
 drinking and eight root n house card playing although he willingly forgave her weaknesses his usual technique was to because
 jessie did not always share her make sinners condemn themselves 2 and it husband s more extreme religious views is
 possible that this interview was painful for there was a certain amount of tension in the eva in any case
 her realization that she must home but according to intimate eye witness always chafe against the strictures of the eva
 the chatelaine of the house emerged household may have contributed to her victorious from the majority of family decision to
 find other accommodation after squabbles during her year with the family little more than a year at the aberharts eva
 became very close to jessie aberhart and fond of her daughters khona and ola eva worked wherever she could over
 the next especially the latter who was her age and few years but whenever she found herself lived in calgary
 unemployed she took classes at the alberta history autumn 2004 u should support a system of social credit to deal
 with the depression as she later explained the idealism of social credit appealed to my young mind 4 the first
 social credit groups began forming in calgary in 1933 but the movement gained momentum quickly and by 1934 local chapters
 of the social credit league had been organized throughout the province understanding that the new movement could benefit from a
 newspaper to coordinate its activities give voice to its concerns and counteract negative publicity in the established media veteran publisher
 charles k underwood approached aberhart and suggested that he could establish and publish just such an organ aberhart agreed although
 he did not offer financial support and the social credit chronicle began weekly publication in july l 934 luckily for
 eva underwood was an old family friend from macleod where he had edited the local newspaper a dozen years before
 she was delighted with his offer of employment and became the chronicle s circulation manager at a salary of 8
 per week as one of the few paid staff members at the chronicle eva worked closely with underwood and discovered
 an unsuspected interest in the newspaper business encouraged to fill many roles soon she was writing up local league reports
 and then short pieces about the effects of the depression on ordinary people glad of her help underwood also recognized
 her natural ability as a reporter although her writing skills required more active mentoring she later dismissed her first attempts
 as a feeble effort in writing but with experience she improved and she proudly labelled a social credit publicity portrait
 girl reporter soon she was producing regular articles and profiles of social credit personalities even contributing reports on the first
 social credit conventions held in calgary and edmonton in april 1935 around this time eva also began writing a chatty
 weekly column of miscellaneous notes and observations relating to social conditions and social credit called here and there with eva
 at the same time as circulation manager she played an active role in the paper s phenomenal growth from an
 initial printing of 4 000 copies in july 1934 circulation mushroomed to 40 000 one year later and at its
 peak 60 000 with a readership extending beyond the alberta borders eva tracked the paper s rising prophetic bible institute
 eventually she managed to finish the sixteen courses required to complete the senior pass course whereas the junior pass course
 was designed for those who desire to get the rudiments of bible knowledge so that they may be of ordinary
 service in their church or sunday school the senior pass course was more intense and intended for those interested in
 greater service 3 the courses ranged from bible history and geography to apologetics homiletics and systematic theology although she thought
 they were interesting particularly mr aberhart s own course on bible exegesis eva found them challenging and the marking severe
 except for high marks in personal evangelism her final exam reports in 1933 and 1934 were disappointing with marks uniformly
 low it was in the summer of 1932 well after eva had ceased to board in his home that william
 aberhart adopted and began to espouse social credit ideas in his weekly radio broadcasts but she may well have witnessed
 the early evolution of his thinking during her year with the family certainly she later recalled lively discussions about economic
 matters and aberhart s great personal concern for farmers and the unemployed whom he met through his job as a
 teacher and his evangelical work her own experience with unemployment and the distress she witnessed among farmers during her weekend
 visits home made eva and many others like her receptive to aberhart s persuasive argument that the government william aberhart
 was leader of the social credit party that came to power in alberta in 1935 he is seen here a
 year later at a celebration in calgary at right is ernest c manning eva reid lived with the aberharts in
 the 1930 s alberta history autumn 2004 popularity in a very concrete manner as it was one of her many
 duties to count and roll the coins sent in with new subscriptions sixty five cents for three months 1 25
 for six and 2 25 for a full year eva s close relationship with underwood during the chronicle years appears
 to have been personal as well as professional and there is evidence that they may have had a brief love
 affair although she never alluded to this possibility publicly she saved among her few treasured letters from family and friends
 two notes from seekay as underwood always signed his poetry one of these begs forgiveness from my own own dearest

 of the calgaryalbertan which had been struggling with circulation problems as a result of the depression bell s pressing financial
 need dovetailed nicely with aberhart s determination to control a daily newspaper a desire which had grown out of his
 frustration with the blatantly anti social credit editorial policy of powerful local dailies such as the calgary herald in januaiy
 1936 the albertan was sold to a syndicate of social creditors on the condition that they raise the purchase price
 of 600 000 through a public offering of stock as well as enjoying the confidence of the government the albertan
 became the official organ of the alberta social credit party and as such agreed to publish the social credit chronicle
 as a weekly insert this arrangement was acceptable to underwood mainly because he realized that the chronicle had served its
 original purpose by assisting in the victory sweep of social credit candidates in the august 1935 election and was now
 in danger of becoming simply a local interest news paper 8 he and eva reid joined the albertan staff although
 his independent nature soon caused him to move on weekly chronicle inserts were included in the albertan for two years
 and for a period of time staff received half their pay in social credit prosperity certificates aberhart s so called

 primary focus remained the weekly publication of the chronicle insert although her little column here and there with eva was
 discontinued after only two issues but in 1937 she declined re nomination as secretary treasurer of the calgary constituency association
 citing work pressures as her excuse when it became evident in 1938 that the social credit syndicate was unable to
 sell sufficient shares to cover the price of the albertaii the option to purchase was allowed to expire thereby releasing
 the paper from its commitment to the social credit party here and there by eva did you ever take a

 candidates once even standing in for a double booked edith gostick during a radio broadcast featuring the views of fred

 in rescuing those who needed help from the and perhaps an even greater one for despair of the depression 9
 brown asserted educated young men there also was a fear that christian charity more than recruitment that crime and vice
 might stem from was the pressing issue of the time unemployment 2 consequently the y was motivated by social concerns
 as well as the the time leisure league was launched in spiritual needs of its members mid summer 1933 via
 newspaper articles word of mouth announcements from the in spite of a 5 000 reduction in its operating pulpits and
 formal invitations to ymca budget a may 30 1931 report made it clear supporters to bring young men to the
 that the y would continue to help against the program while a rationalized program the bewildering and damning experience of
 the league placed few strict requirements on depression general secretary cecil brown membership there was to be no bait and
 likened the task to the ancient feeding of the switch religious instruction in exchange for five thousand with a few
 loafs sicl 3 at an leisure opportunities there were no job estimated cost of 2 000 the y supplied training
 requirements in fact even the age towels soap hot water lockers washrooms limitations originally envisioned by brown toilets writing material
 stamps telegrams became merely a guideline later it was this and beds for those in need later 1933 the less
 formal nature of the program that pool and gym were made available to non eventually resulted in its real success
 members three mornings a week no fellows in need we could possibly assist have the appeal of the league to
 the unemployed ever been turned down 5 was at least in part the social and recreational opportunities unavailable to the
 y s notion of a formalized program to them elsewhere many young men in the respond specifically to the depression
 first pre depression era had become used to appeared in 1932 in the minneapolis ymca leisure time spent in activities
 where they had in an attempt to unite unemployed young a variety of options and a degree of control men
 who desire to maintain their physical free of social manipulation with the loss of and mental vigor 6 in calgary
 the general a steady income commercial leisure choices secretary introduced the idea to his board of diminished by offering opportunities
 for directors in august 1933 his notion was for young men to socialize in a situation which a leisure time
 league for single local offered good clean fun and vocational men between the ages of 16 and 30 and was
 training with no insistence on christian dedicated more to relieving the education or employment strategies brown psychological pressure of unemployment
 and the league unknowingly were than to saving souls religious training or encouraging a degree of personal input as even
 training for employment while cost well as physical and spiritual renewal for may have been a concern dividends were to
 participants be found in changed lives of the loos of young men who are struggling in the stormy the structure
 of the program was based on seas of adversity 7 the board was sessions or classes that could be divided
 unanimous in its support for the plan into basic categories for example at one designed to stop the drift towards
 fear point it offered the following leisure pessimism and even vice and crime 8 it recreation including gym classes boxing
 was obvious early in the program that the swimming wrestling glee club orchestra group was not to be employment focused
 but and dramatics personal growth offering was an alternative to the potential personal lessons in french spanish first aid and
 life and social dangers of forced leisure saving and vocational training including courses in radio public speaking while brown and
 the league faced criticism salesmanship book keeping shorthand and for being luke warm on christianity brown a camera club r
 won general support by observing that never was the y more basically and soundly these classes were taught or supervised
 by christian in its activities and outlook when volunteers and attendance reveals what the measured by the principles of jesus
 as it was participants were seeking from the alberta history autumn 2004 program throughout their existence demographic this would suggest
 that the vocational classes rarely reached double program had very flexible guidelines rather digits in weekly attendance except than strict
 requirements for participation by occasionally radio and public speaking by 1936 201 members had families 95 were contrast leisure recreation
 classes such over 30 years old and eight were over 50 as swimming 124 participants gym 116 years 8 sadly
 this evidence also reveals that boxing 55 and wrestling 34 had much the deepening depression was more stronger weekly averages
 2 because they debilitating than anticipated but rather than were recreational in nature these classes abandon those in need the
 y seemed willing were also much less formally controlled and to adjust to the needs of its participants supervised than
 classes in the other including transients who had sponsorship categories giving participants much greater say than in vocational classes it
 is evident although vocational courses were never that what the participants wanted was not job oversubscribed and christian training was
 training but a social experience where they not forced upon participants both remained could exercise some degree of control over
 available to those who wanted them for an aspect of their lives example sunday church services were offered and in
 1936 fifty league members calgary ymca surveys of those entering the completed their first aid certificates leisure time league revealed
 that 84 per sunday concerts were common as were cent of participants had no job prospects at semi formal bible
 classes but the real appeal all 79 per cent were discouraged 26 per of the league remained the leisure and
 cent were lonesome amid 18 per cent felt their recreational opportunities situation was hopeless 3 there were no jobs to
 train for or at least it was assumed that in january 1935 a participant wrote to thank opportunities to work
 were just not there the y personally i cannot pay too high a therefore it is unlikely that these men
 were tribute to the y m c a leisure time league seeking job training and more likely they which has
 been a godsend to me and were attempting to alleviate their boredom hundreds of others in the sam ne position
 and sense of despair participants were more another grateful young man noted while i often seeking diversion comradeship and was
 there ymca i gained self confidence entertainment and certainly some degree of weight and strength steadily and i certainly control
 and choice years later a league have missed it since i started work 2 and participant wrote the calgary y
 and thanked another thanked the league for giving me a it for a chance to keep in condition and a
 chamice to keep in condition by the use of the chance to make friends 4 y s gym shower and
 pool just to be able to keep clean is a life saver for several hundred in its first full year
 the league hosted over of us 22 600 men 2 the poo 1 and gym were made available daily from
 9 30 tol 1 00 am and by 1936 the league had evolved beyond were the most frequently attended sessions
 6 what cecil brown and the ymca executive these were also the least controllable had anticipated it now accepted olden
 men activities and afforded young men a greater and married men and was primarily a chance to have a say
 in their own leisure recreation program that allowed for dropping in for a swim or a workout with comimpanionship and
 escape from the friends allowed temporary escape from the psychological effects of no work what had psychological morass of unemployability
 in happened to the program from n its inception 1937 the per day attendance in gym was 22 to the
 end of 1936 was that since work and swimming was 26 by comparison show preparation and religious education were decard
 printing and book keeping averaged five enmphasized or assumed a negotiated space people 7 rather than a contested space emerged
 where participants developed a greater say over the by 1936 it had become obvious that while nature of their league
 experience it is the initial plan was to offer help to young obvious that these young men did not want
 local men under 30 the league also had further spiritual intervention or job training participants who fell outside the assumed
 but appreciated the chance to get out of the alberta history autumn 2004 house to socialize and to have some

 of 1 500 donation to the ymca and in 1936 failure and despair as most were not young a motion
 was made by ed stacey that the lads looking for work but adult males rotarians provide another 500 in the
 form hooking for a place to exercise some degree of 5 00 memberships for 100 ltl of personal control the
