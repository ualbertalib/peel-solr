 in 1945 by max foran with the death of grant macewan on june 15 2000 at age ninetyseven western canada
 lost more than one of its most heralded citizens a living legend has passed one whose achievements and lifestyle embodied
 the spirit of a region and whose presence touched the hearts of thousands he was a the paradox of grant
 macewan simple man whose easy charm and is reflected in this 1966 view of consistency to self made him the
 friend of him with two hats one as thousands young and old rich and poor lieutenant governor and the urban
 and rural he was also a universal other as an agriculturist man a man for all seasons a public figure
 alberta history i autumn 2001 writ large a teacher a writer an historian and a spokesman for all living things
 grant macewan was also a man of paradoxes he was my role model my mentor my friend and an enigma
 i never really solved for almost forty years i was associated with him as the son in law he had
 somehow inherited from distant australia being drawn together by a love of history we shared innumerable conversations over the years
 he infected me with a love of the west and was an important factor influencing me in my decision to
 pursue western canadian history at the academic level i recorded many of our conversations not wishing future generations to be
 deprived of hearing him recount stories of the west in that wonderful affirmative voice embellished by a superb turn of
 the phrase and just a touch of the scottish highland brogue i helped him build shelves decks and cabins we
 excavated wells and stripped logs we shingled roofs and planted trees and shrubs i went with him often when he
 was lieutenant governor of alberta and watched him mingle with crowds like no other i heard him speak formally on
 countless occasions and more significant to me i listened in on dozens of informal conversations he had with an anlazing
 range of individuals froni all states and walks of life we wrote together in his study in edmonton sometimes for
 hours both comfortable in our silences we both enjoyed sport and watched football games on tv although he rarely lasted
 beyond the half when the challenge of tasksuncoinpleted invariably pulled him away i 11 it pa 4 4 asimple man
 of paradoxes watched him be a loving grandfather to my two daughters enlivening our house with his booming laugh and
 incessant energy i typed manuscripts for him when his fingers lost their nimbleness and towards the end when he was
 in the beverly centre i used to visit him regularly arriving armed with questions for the book i was writing
 on alberta s cattle industry in short i came to know appreciate and love this man who could also conjure
 up in me a spectrum of emotion 1 held grant macewan in awe i marvelled at his formidable strength of
 mind and body i admired his patience envied his memory and took inordinate pleasure whenever he complimented me on the
 other hand his stubbornness and frugality sometimes frustrated me for example although he was extremely hard of hearing he would
 not wear a hearing aid because of the expense involved similarly he refused to invest in an electric typewriter because
 it wasted power and cost too much when he was in his own apartment in his late eighties he was
 difficult to contact because he would not bear the expense of installing a phone and in all three instances there
 worst exhibited no more than a touch of gentle knavery nostalgia thus emerged as a dominant theme in his public
 and private dialogues he called for a return to farming the old fashioned way with horses and felt that the
 world would be a better place with less production and more simplicity of purpose he loved the romantic poems ballads
 and songs of the nineteenth century and in private moments particularly in his later years was unabashedly sentimental over them
 he mistrusted machinery and firmly believed that the automobile was testimony to man t wastefulness and laziness in short the
 western canadian rural past evoked simplicity of life and purpose and became to macewan a mental haven where behavioural norms
 were understood obeyed and in a subconscious way relished on the other hand grant macewan was a true visionary he
 was writing seriously about conservation issues long before they became public concerns his messages about habitat destruction natural resource depletion
 and land degradation were more was no persuading him otherwise sometimes i thought he pushed his concept of duty too
 far denying himself and others the frequency of more sustained personal experiences though he laughed a lot he could also
 be terse he was as generous with his time and assistance as he was frugal towards himself he read voraciously
 but never for pleasure in many ways the simple man was not simple at all grant macewan was a man
 of seeming contradictions without question grant macewan was a romanticist a true nineteenth century man his roseate view of the
 pioneer era stands as a prime example probably inspired by his mother whom he loved dearly macewan was forever extolling
 the virtues of the pioneers who endured travail cheerfully and uncomplainingly the pioneer figures about whom he wrote were characterized
 by their commitment to the land their families and to their creator none was lazy or dissolute indeed the three
 of the authors contributing to this special tribute max foran don smith and hugh dempsey are seen with grant macewan

 too late he told me shortly intellectual reaction to things he could no before his death that the issue of
 the longer abide he once told me that his twenty first century would be water and gradual change in philosophy
 was related that its scarcity and increasing importance to his ultimate realization that god and to human existence posed mankind
 with its nature were inseparable yet i also firmly greatest threat to date evidence suggests believe that he killed only
 out of necessity that he might be right just like his early or as a clinical function of his job
 in this statements about urban encroachment on sense his transformation from viewing a prime rural land have proved chillingly steer
 as a product to seeing it as a sentient accurate the tenor of his last book speaks being marked one
 of the most significant of an even more serious problem waiting episodes in his life for its time not surprisingly
 then his writings became i would contend that macewan s adoption increasingly oriented to the future with of vegetarianism on
 moral grounds places age his forays into the past were him squarely in a futurist tradition it has concerned mainly
 with gathering been argued that the survival of the human information that would reinforce his race is linked to man
 s success in toynbeeian notions of the cyclical nature of recognizing his proper ecological place on history in some ways
 he saw the future as a the planet macewan embraced trust and felt that the current generations vegetarianism on two
 grounds first he had no moral right to usurp what belonged believed that in the presence of choice any to
 their descendants when we were not willful killing was morally wrong second discussing the book i was writing most of
 he saw conscious and unnecessary our conversations in the beverly centre in extermination of life as disturbing the 1999 2000
 were about the challenges facing earth s harmonious cycles as such his call the twenty first century for tolerance and
 restraint places him towards the end of a moral and ecological the paradox of the man living in both the
 spectrum that stretches far into the future past and the future is not difficult to as he once told a
 pro hunting group i understand if one recognizes grant don t eat my friends in all the time i macewan
 s ideal of the land as sacred as knew him i never saw him kill anything i symbolic and even
 part of a deity he was have seen him working in the sun his arms bound to serve his beautifully
 eloquent and legs covered with flies and mosquitoes creed says it far better than i ever could and ignoring them
 on the grounds that he identified with the past because he saw they had to eat too the beautiful the
 pioneer s relationship with the land as simplicity with which he acted out these interdependent farms were smaller and beliefs
 on the public stage sets grant interference with the land was restricted macewan apart devoid of political he once told
 my wife heather and me that motivations self aggrandizement if he ever farmed his property at westward martyrdom or fanaticism
 his attitude ho he would replicate nineteenth century towards all his friends provided a cultivation methods i sometimes think that
 blueprint for a better future despite his enormous appreciation of cash crop agriculture his own personal one should not forget
 that these sentiments ambitions did not go beyond subsistence were forged in a man who had practised farming he thus
 saw the past as a time animal husbandry for most of his life a when land usage approximated his ideals
 man who had given beef butchering and of agriculture this was part of the reason dressing seminars and who made
 his living he loved the heavy farm horses strong as for a time promoting beef consumption they were they could
 not rape the land like all great people macewan allowed his philosophy to evolve never a reflective similarly macewan lived
 in the future for man his attitudinal change towards his the same sort of reasons only here he saw alberta
 history i autumn 2001 in his 1966 book entrusted to my care macewan emphasized the importance of caring for the
 environment he is seen here with j d bradley examining the bituminous sands at fort mcmurray in 1948 very different
 processes taking place he saw pillage and degradation by machines that could dominate the land the large agricultural enterprises that
 tormented the land with chemicals and which needed less and less human sweat and love the swathes of devastation caused
 by clear cut logging and the pollution of streams by industry were too much for him to bear the crusader
 in him could not stand by and watch he had to speak out he needed to project his thoughts and
 this necessitated both research and informed reasoning in short the past was his haven the future was his battlefield and
 he lived in both the second paradox i noticed in grant macewan was really one of my first observations about
 him when i arrived in calgary he was mayor and i was swept into a social world where he appeared
 to know everyone i was introduced to so many people that i felt at times like visiting royalty i soon
 learned that a walk down stephen avenue or through the midway during stampede with him could be interminable stop start
 exercises and this went on through the years i once chose about a dozen alberta and saskatchewan towns at random
 and asked him if he knew anyone in them or their surrounding regions not surprisingly he batted one hundred percent
 during my extensive interviews with him i discovered that he was on good speaking terms with the vast majority of
 political and agricultural figures in western canada over a time span of more than sixty years yet grant macewan had
 few if any close friends by close friends i mean those in whom he would confide those with whom he
 would do things voluntarily or just for fun in short those he palled around with by this i do not
 mean to denigrate those who over the years have counted him as a true friend i knew and loved him
 as much as anybody and i certainly place myself in the same category you could not get close to grant
 macewan not on the intuitive level where shared vulnerabilities bind you together as friends except when he was asking me
 about my work our conversations were extremely objective above grant macewan mixed as easily with royalty as his did with
 sodbusters he is seen here in 1973 as lieutenant governor greeting queen elizabeth at his left are his wife phyllis
 and premier peter lougheed left grant macewan in 1947 in the type of rural setting he so enjoyed alberta history
 autumn 2001 u as the train pulled away i looked back to the platform to see him standing bareheaded against
 the north wind hands in pockets laughing uproariously with two black porters time and time again i saw him work
 his magic among the people a gifted public speaker he could capture an audience like no one else i have
 ever seen he gravitated to the public as much as they were drawn to him in many ways it was
 a symbiotic relationship set against this extraordinary record of voluntary and spontaneous public involvement is the fact that grant macewan
 was an extremely private man for example he was not an easy person to interview in that he would not
 talk about himself except in broad generalities i always had a devilish time trying to extract meaningful information about pivotal
 events in his life when i was reading his journals i was astounded to find him referring to himself as
 the macewan i heard speak on many occasions about the co operative efforts of the pioneers who worked diligently together
 to achieve a common goal one would assume that he saw this as an ideal to be lived not so
 when we were building our house in priddis we called on our friends to help us erect the pre cut
 log structure of course grant was there he was the first to arrive as i recall by late morning the
 group was assembled working together noisily and with the loose form of cohesion typical of working bees where was grant
 off on his own he had set himself aside to work alone and silently and at his own pace he
 kept working through rest breaks and would have through lunch had not heather insisted he join us where was the
 camaraderie of the volunteer endeavour he certainly was not part of it at christmas time when we opened our presents
 he was more intent with assembling all the paper wrappings than he was with enjoying his or others gifts he
 would leave to dispose of them sometimes before the last present was opened much to the chagrin of his wife
 phyllis whenever he suddenly vanished from a social group at our house i knew where to find him in my
 library of course the public figure writ relate to large groups when he was in his seventies he used to
 speak about returning to politics one can envisage his formidable presence on the campaign trail i have no doubt that
 he would have presented a much different and more powerful persona than he did in 1958 when he led the
 provincial liberal party into an election the strength of his common touch with people was rooted in its genuineness i
 vividly recall an incident when he drove me to the train station in edmonton it was a cold winter day
 and he was habitually clad in a top coat of marginal quality and warmth he was lieutenant governor at the
 time and his privacy reinforced my own in retrospect i realize that it was our mutual interest in history that
 bound us together more than anything else and now am led to wonder what the depth of our relationship would
 have been otherwise the paradox of the man with thousands of friends but no close ones is buttressed by another
 dimension grant macewan was a public figure writ large he loved being with the people no matter who or what
 their status he had this uncanny ability to grant became famous for planting a tree every time he attended an
 outdoor ceremony here he performs the ritual at the 50 th anniversary of the southern alberta institute in calgary in
 1966 alberta history autumn 2001 large was also a loner individuals in terms of their general how could one have
 so many friends yet usefulness for example although he never none really or cloak a private persona said anything i
 doubt whether he ever under such a beloved public presence i really approved of my playing squash and think a
 possible explanation lies on two spending time with friends afterwards levels first is the fact that grant shovelling snow or
 planting trees would macewan s concept of friendship was give me as much exercise and i would be a different
 to mine and to most of my better man for it since i would have done generation when he was
 with people his something useful the socializing part was warmth and easy familiarity forged absolutely irrelevant i am reminded of
 the relationships that went beyond mere time when we were travelling one acquaintance to him the people he saturday and
 passed a field where newlyenjoyed being with even for a little time mown hay was lying on the ground grant
 were his friends those he was delighted to see on the street were his friends those he respected and who
 shared similar interests the past was his haven were his friends equally as significant was the future his batl efie
 d the fact that it was reciprocal so at a level consistent with his generation and concept and he ived
 in both of friendship it could be argued that grant macewan had many friends indeed was appalled at the owner
 s negligence when i pointed out that it was a weekend yet why did he not spend a great deal
 of and that the farmer may have had a social time with any of his friends nor exchange life he
 just said maybe in that private concerns or vulnerabilities with maddeningly dismissive way he had of them the answer i
 think lies in his rejecting arguments with which he did not obsessive commitment to task completion agree i think his
 failure to cultivate close friendships has a lot to do with the dictates a third paradox concerns grant of time
 and urgency that governed his life macewan s attitude towards individuals as work was everything play was a fleeting opposed
 to institutions he made a name luxury the self imposed demands of work for himself as an author by writing
 about and the urgency that accompanied them people during his writing career he precluded the time necessary to cultivate brought
 the unknown deeds of more close friendships his closest acquaintances western canadians to the public eye that were invariably people
 he worked or had anyone else to him everyone had a story worked with and it was they who provided
 to tell and he i elished the opportunity to him with his social discourse and even tell it for them
 thus many of his these had to he squeezed in between characters had no particular claim to commitments he once
 told me that he greatness except that they were true would have rafted down the south characters grant macewan admired
 saskatchewan river with his colleague al individuality and his subjects all ewen more often but time always got in demonstrated
 some nobility of human the way he also denied himself the endeavour whether it be bob edwards the enrichment of
 friendships through iconoclastic editor of the eye opener sustained social interactions or activities mother fulham frontier calgary s parties happy

 founder of notre dame college were never part of his life in wilcox saskatchewan paddy nolan the often intemperate but
 brilliant early he was obsessive about work his stock calgary lawyer or even heather s ferrets phrase of having a
 few things to do has leaping and dancing around our kitchen become part of our family lexicon and we like
 furry dervishes grant macewan loved often joke about measuring the worth of spirit and character in people and animals alberta
 history autumn 2001 u he himself was one of life s world s great in the efficacy of the corporate
 voice over characters and in many ways was the the individual embodiment of the effervescence and uniqueness he found in
 others macewan s faith in institutional behaviour is not hard to understand as i have yet for all this love
 of individuality and indicated earlier he was very much a admiration for people who did things their nineteenth century man
 his view is way in spite of opposition and travail consistent with nineteenth century grant macewan was a firm believer
 in the whiggery that saw man s development in primacy of institutions over the individual terms of orderly patterns shaped
 and he felt that the institutional voice was determined by institutional gradualism he more stable than the individual in some
 saw institutions as bastions of stability ways he mistrusted human capability and rather than agents of control the felt that
 people generally had a propensity impersonal role of institutions as a buttress towards ill discipline and personal against human caprice
 appealed to ambition institutions on the other hand macewan s conservative nature indeed he could be trusted and therefore their
 felt that institutional waywardness only policies and decisions should be followed occurred when they were pre empted by to the
 letter in response to a federal irresponsible leaders government news release he once wrote a sizeable cheque to revenue canada
 in terms of reconciling this paradox i think defraying his share of the national debt macewan s admiration of individual
 when i told him about a policeman who endeavour needs to be qualified i do not had given me a
 break on a marginal think he saw conflict between what his speeding infraction he was very critical of historical figures
 were trying to do and the the officer and bluntly informed me that he undermining of institutions paddy nolan the
 policeman had no right to interpret sought justice frederick haultain had a the article of the law similarly he was
 not vision of western canada pat burns pleased with my wife s public brought pluck and ingenuity to develop a
 demonstrations in favour of animal rights new industry the closest he came to because they were unsanctioned and anti lauding
 an individual bent on undermining institutional statements his penchant for the status quo was bob edwards but here establishing charitable
 foundations also grant saw edwards as mocking pretension provides an excellent example of his belief not societal stability and he

 autumn 2001 approved of edwards championing of the prohibitionist cause as he once told me he tended to mute distasteful
 aspects of his biographical subjects personality in the interests of their nobler qualities grant macewan had a wonderful sense of
 humour it was very important to his life as anyone who has heard his booming infectious laugh will agree he
 loved to laugh and laugh hard heather and i used to joke about the one thing that might bring on
 a heart attack would be a too boisterous response to one of her ferret s crazy antics he liked most
 kinds of humour especially the absurd in animals and the spontaneous in humans one might be surprised to learn that
 he liked silly small dogs far better than large dignified ones i recall many times his ability to reduce an
 audience to tears of laughter by recounting stories of his experiences as mayor or lieutenant governor given the importance of
 humour to grant macewan one can see his gravitation towards biography instead of institutional studies humans are funny institutions are
 not finally grant macewan admired uniqueness for its own sake yet it could be enhanced through determination and hard work
 on the other hand institutions were symbols the embodiments of order and sensible management as a practical man he never
 saw them in contradictory terms the flesh and blood of individuals nurtured spirit humour uniqueness and caprice the latter caprice
 might be selectively ignored in biography or when one admired characters from a distance but ultimately it engendered disorder on
 the other hand one could not write nor talk fondly about institutions because they were fleshless impersonal and devoid of
 humour but in the final analysis it was they who could be trusted to do the right and proper thing
 though i have tried to explain away what i perceived to be grant macewan s paradoxical behaviour the reader might
 be excused for thinking that i found him inconsistent nothing could be further from the truth and herein lies the
 greatest paradox of all i maintain that grant macewan s paradoxical patterns are contradicted by a consistency to self unmatched
 in my own reading or personal experience unlike many of us who define our ambitions in terms of self satisfaction
 a 4 z r ‘ ‘ v • 1 i alberta history autumn 2001 top this early western canadian engraving
 typifies macewan s attitude towards agriculture and the work ethic above a smiling grant macewan is seen here at a
 tribute dinner in calgary in 1994 at right is mayor al duerr grant macewan was driven by three abhorrences all
 were manifested to the extreme and either singly or interdependently explained his behaviour his lifestyle was a mirror of these
 perceptions the first and probably the most important was waste his hatred of waste explained his frugality his conservation and
 his lament over resource depletion when applied to time it gave motivation to his work ethic second he could not
 abide idleness his disdain for extended social activity and his relentless unending commitment to the work ethic are cases in
 point he saw task completion as the sole antidote of idleness and this impacted negatively on his ability to develop
 close relationships finally grant macewan despised irresponsibility and to be sure his concept of responsibility was extremely high a superbly
 self disciplined man his penchant for applying similar standards to everyone else placed a lot of mankind in the irresponsible
 category it was this attitude plus his observations on the implications of waste and idleness that led him to see
 institutions as mankind s best spokespersons one could argue that there was a fourth dimension to grant macewan a gentler
 more personal side his charisma his total lack of ego his warmth and folksy charm and genuineness his love of
 children and his empathy towards those in pain contributed to his enormous popular appeal his facility with people was quite
 remarkable because in its symbiotic nature it went well beyond the mere populism of political figures with the common touch
 in another person his relentless assault on waste idleness and irresponsibility might not have been received well in grant macewan
 s case the way the message was delivered plus the fact that the messenger was also the message have enshrined
 him as one of western canada s leading and most beloved public figures of the twentieth century grant macewan was
 many things to many people all who met him have their own favourite story and special memory it takes a
 very unique figure to command that degree of personal identification to me he was a multi faceted person who never
 ceased to surprise me i still miss him greatly like many great figures his simplicity hid many complexities and in
 this discussion i have tried to explain some of these yet in the final analysis i will remember grant macewan
 as the toughest and gentlest man i have ever met yet another paradox max foran a son in law of
 grant macewan is an assistant professor in the faculty of communications culture university of calgary alberta history autumn 2001 grant
 macewan was photographed in his office in 1948 the year the sodbusters was published alberta s foremost storyteller donald b
 smith jn the spring of 1966 the historical society of alberta honoured grant macewan for his outstanding contribution to alberta
 s history the newly appointed lieutenant governor of alberta then sixty three years old appeared to have reached the high
 point of his career as a western canadian popular historian but appearances can be deceiving thirty plus years and thirty
 plus books remained ahead he had only begun to make his contribution to our understanding of ourselves and of our
 region grant s extraordinary energy and organizational skills help to explain his success in popular history at a time when
 he had numerous university community and later political commitments born in 1902 he grew up on a pioneer farm just
 north of brandon manitoba after several years in brandon itself he spent his teenaged years on the family s new
 farm in the carrot river valley near melfort saskatchewan early in his life he developed work habits of long hours
 marked by efficient use of time 2 grant s knowledge of western canada s rural past came from his farm
 upbringing as well as from his university training and teaching in saskatchewan he walked two miles each way to school
 en route the teenager studied the flora and fauna acquiring the deep knowledge and appreciation of nature which appears throughout
 his work 3 he knew intimately of what he wrote on the family farm he lived through the entire early
 twentieth century prairie experience from breaking virgin sod with horse and plow to the full mechanization of agriculture his years
 of study at the ontario agricultural college it guelph ontario and graduate work at the iowa state college of agriculture
 as well as his teaching at both the universities of saskatchewan and manitoba deepened his macewan was guest speaker at

 the necessary attributes agriculture needed for recording and writing on western canada s past but the agricultural the future historian
 of prairie canada knew specialist only began to write on human how to communicate easily with the public historical topics
 when he was in his forties while at the ontario agricultural college like many canadians before and since he one
 summer he sold nursery stock had a negative experience with history in throughout southwestern ontario he sold school his ontario

 the university of saskatchewan he loved giving community arthur silver morton a distinguished talks and judging at cattle shows by
 the canadian historian at the university of early young 1930 s the young professor had saskatchewan awakened grant s interest
 in established a reputation as a gifted and western canada s past a diary entry in popular speaker on agricultural
 topics and 1938 refers to their joint search for the on others as well but when the university sites of
 old fur trading posts in of saskatchewan decided to emphasize saskatchewan grant wrote i have this scholarship and pure research
 rather than year been favored with the opportunity of contact with the public grant s interest in the institution declined

 years grant macewan holds a forked chance in 1946 to become the dean of willow stick for witching for agriculture
 at manitoba with the assigned later he dedicated his book cornerstone water while three locals look on task of taking
 the university out to colony selkirk s contribution to the he was photographed in 1944 manitoba farms canadian west to
 his friend who had kindly acted years earlier as his selfappointed private tutor in western history 7 history now became
 the young professor of animal husbandry s hobby western canadian history became the subject of more and more of his
 after dinner speeches ideas received from professor morton took shape leading grant to prepare several cbc radio broadcasts as a
 teenager grant kept a diary he enjoyed writing on trips lie recorded logs of the day s events while working
 in ontario selling nursery stock on commission he collected short character sketches in a journal a habit which he alberta
 history autumn 2001 continued for the rest of his life 8 under professor morton s influence he began in the
 late 1930 s gathering notes on historical events in western camiada and on interesting people in the region one of
 the first individuals he began to research was the alberta cattle king pat burns whose biography he eventually wrote forty
 years later grant loved agricultural writing during his honeymoon in 1935 the work driven newlywed brought with him the manuscript
 of his first textbook on agriculture a coauthored study during idle moments he worked on it during the trip 0
 three more textbooks on agriculture followed one also co authored the other two with grant as sole author at the
 same time he wrote university texts he kept up his popular writing contributing more and more to newspapers to reach
 a wider public in the l 930 s he wrote for among other publications the western producer the saskatchewan farmer
 the free press prairie farmer and the family herald his wife phyllis cline a former teacher allowed him the freedom
 to plunge fully into his writing by supporting him in his many university amid community commitments early in their marriage
 phyllis once counted forty nights in a row that professor macewan had been called away on one sort of public
 service or other 2 after the birth of their daughter heather in 1939 phyllis raised her largely on her own
 3 this book reveals grant s marvellous gift for anecdotes the raisins in the dough essential to popular writing speaking
 of the days of the whiskey trade in southern alberta in the early 1870 s he wrote in his essay
 on fred kanouse those on the frontier at that time didn t ask personal questions about ‘ the past and
 didn t tell much actually a man was more likely to achieve old age if his interests in history was
 not too highly developed 5 to chose another alberta example grant included this tale of rancher frank collicutt one of
 the best known names in the livestock fraternity the professor of animal husbandry at the university of saskatchewan mentioned that
 he planned a visit to the collicutt ranch to which frank replied it will take us a couple of days
 to get used to you so you must stay at least a week throughout his book grant included insights that
 indicated his intimate knowledge of the western range little facts such as cowboys love of chewing tobacco as it helped
 to counteract the dust when driving cattle 7 throughout the volume the author s love of the early ranching period
 shines through a time when there was no barbed wire to restrict the cattle and a man could ride 500
 miles in any direction without opening a gate grant s first history book the sodbusters appeared in 1948 the manuscript
 originated six years earlier in a four part cbc radio series which the network aired in 1943 and l 944
 grant s interviews with old timers as well as his own library research furnished him with the ideal topic the
 pioneer farmers and colourful individuals who opened up the canadian prairies to supplement the radio portraits previously prepared grant added
 new biographies bringing the total number to thirty seven top judging cattle at a show in moosomin saskatchewan in 1947
 above a young grant macewan alberta history autumn 2001 one can best describe the sodbusters as a centuries of agriculture
 in western canada white man s history of the canadian grant s foreword includes this statement of west the sodbuster
 heroes occupy belief the agriculture of western canada centre stage few wives or female thus has a personality that is
 rich and companions receive mention native people colourful the story of its romantic rise appear only occasionally and when they
 should reveal entertaining academic and do they surface negatively more frequently cultural values and is one that should be than
 positively grant for instance told in school and college classrooms 2 includes a reference to kootenai brown hilda neatby of
 the department of history and party in 1865 being pursued by a band at the university of saskatchewan enjoyed of
 indians on a scalp hunt scalps are reading the volume written with the verve difficult to replace so the white
 men and zest of one who loves the story he has instead of stopping to enjoy the scenery to tell
 but she did voice serious concerns pressed on eastward 2 yet the sodhu sters the book lacked docrmmentation a does
 inclrmde two african canadians bibliography and analysis the author she alberta cowboy john wai e and dr alfred added was
 no historian he lacks the schmitz shadd a saskatchewan doctor who historian s faculty for combining mastery of practised as
 well as farmed in the carrot facts and logical analysis with that exercise river valley where grant was raised of
 imagination necessary to produce one whole clear picture of the past 22 grant s later books in the 1960 s
 and 1970 s were far more sensitive to the native people was professor neatby s review fair one and women
 as he left behind this white could argue that she and many future man s history flavour reviewers of grant
 macewan s books misjudged his intentions he wrote for a grant moved to calgary in 195 i and a year
 general audience grant aspired to be a later between the red and the rockies was good teller of stories amid
 not to analyse or published by the university of toronto to provide the latest interpretations the press telling the story
 of one and half agricultural expert came to human history with a sense of urgency he wanted both western and
 eastermi canadians to know western canada s past as he told max foran in 1983 my own parents belonged to
 a generation which came in soon after the railroad arrived i knew that they had a story and that there
 were people around mc who made me laugh and inspired me with their stories but that nothing was happening to
 record their memories 24 as grant was the first to admit i wasn t an historian by training i stumbled
 into it 25 professor morton had provided initial gi midance by reading english historian arnold toynbee s monumental a study
 of history 10 volumes 1934 54 which a popular speaker throughout appeared in an abridgement by d c the west
 macewan is seen here somervell 2 volumes 1946 1957 he also during citizenship night at the obtained usefrml background toynbec
 s south edmonton junior interpretation of world history as a cyclical chamber of commerce one in which civilizations rose declined
 gathering in 1966 and eventually fell influenced him greatly alberta history autumn 2001 years later he mentioned to writer donna
 von hauff that he greatly admired toynbee once he added someone asked toynbee if a civilization could prevent its own
 decline the historian replied that it could by reviving some of the old fashioned values resourcefulness and self reliance and
 thrift 2 grant fully shared this outlook grant s first three history books were published in toronto after completing his
 next manuscript in 1956 he sent it off to ontario the manuscript carried the working title boozological bob alberta s
 prize personality it was a biography of the life and times of bob edwards of the calgary eye opener the
 most outrageous newspaper in early twemitieth century western canada no one had ever written a full study of him at
 the end of his enquiry letter gi ant mentioned i think that i should add just this that if amid
 when a book is published on bob the people of the west will go for it enthusiastically 27 but grant
 s track record and assurances of a western canadian market were not good enough thomiias nelson sons decided not to
 proceed as did the university of toronto press and macniillans all large toronto publishing houses fortunately the institute of applied
 art educational publishers in edmonton and the only book publisher in alberta at the time took a chance on the
 manuscript they brought it out as eye opener bob that october 2 it proved a great success amid ranks as
 one of grant s best books in bob edwards a noble man who fought a losing battle against alcoholism he
 had the ideal character in grant s words the best subject for a biography is somebody who achieved something wasn
 t all saint and wasn t all sinner but a little of both grant located copies of the eye opener
 and read them carefully throughout he indicated the issues from which he took his information and mentioned in his text
 the old timers he consulted when grant first came to calgary he obtained a position as the beef pi oducers
 council s general managem a perfect day job from his point of view as it left him with plenty of
 time for other interests he quickly became involved in community activities winning a seat on city council in 1953 and
 then electiomi to the provincial legislature in 1955 after becoming a mla he remained an alderman but resigned from the
 beef producers council to continue his writing he took an office in the maclean building downtown since demolished he bought
 some second hand furniture and decorated the walls with prints of the old west by the american cowboy artist charlie
 russell in his small low priced office his hole in the wall grant produced in the late l 950 s
 eye opener bob fifty mighty men and several other very successful books 3 calgary changed enormously in the 1950 s
 gramit came at a time when the huge influx of newcomers during the city s oil and gas boom pushed
 aside tales of early calgary he arrived just in time to record stories soon to disappear one must appreciate the
 context the glenbow archives and library that wonderful repository of western canadian history only began in bob edwards was sketched
 by artist william perehudoff as an illustration for macewan s book fifty mighty men alberta history autumn 2001 1956 in
 late may 1957 grant urged the without deep character analysis or men s canadian club of calgary to work interpretation
 of events the volumes for more historical research and for the include a number of well researched essays preservation of
 old calgary records the such as that on the important female ideas and records of the past are like the
 alberta farm leader irene parlby and passenger pigeon once they are gone they several fine descriptive passages his word are
 gone forever 3 picture of the famous cree leader big bear on horseback is exceptional when rising in 1958 the
 year that grant became leader within sight of enemy indians he could of the provincial liberal party he published cling
 spider like to the side of his galloping horse and use the animal as a i believe that biography i
 s t h e b est way shield while shooting from the under side of the neck to inspire young
 people grant also wrote many full length kids need heroes individual biographies including those of john ware pat burns walking
 buffalo two books calgary cavalcade and fifty sitting bull charles noble frederick mighty men calgary cavalcade the first haultain and
 col james walker he used history of calgary since a slight this format to tell the story of a person
 and promotional work in 1912 and a soft cover their times as a popular historian he felt booklet written in
 1950 32 it emphasized the that biography furnished the best approach city s remarkable characters to write it to the
 general public he once mentioned to grant went through newspapers and old his son in law max foran i believe
 that city council minutes as well as biography is the best way to inspire young interviewing old timers well received
 it people kids need heroes 3 went through four printings the last in ‘ m f l 975 grant resigned
 as alberta liberal leader in 1959 returned to the city council and fifly mighty men a collection of fifty became
 mayor of calgary from 1963 to t e l 7 to aib 1 1965 h d l 1974 april 24
 1958 came out as well in 1958 he kept writing he simply could not stop the collection included biographies of
 six when a reporter asked him in 1967 if he native people all presented in a positive planned to write
 another book grant light in 1975 it was followed by a replied that s like asking an alcoholic if companion
 volume and mighty women he s going to get drunk again 4 with the too with character sketches of fifty

 peoples of western canada book also appeared in paperback as a short prairie books portraits of the plains 1971 and
 metis history of western canada that same makers of history 1981 36 both offei ed to year the general public

 both lieutenant governor in 1974 the university volumes he presented a very positive image of calgary appointed grant to give
 a credit of the native peoples course in the history department from the red to the rockies on the exploration
 as in previous macewan books he aimed and settlement of the canadian prairies in his collective biographies to tell a
 good he also undertook to give two lectures a story and provide an enjoyable read week at olds agricultural college
 on the alberta history autumn 2001 history of western canadian agriculture in the following year he began giving a western
 canadian history course for seniors 4 at the same time he kept up his publication of books on western canada
 at white heat grant s extraordinary ability to manage time helps to explain the prolific publications if not travelling he
 would get up early in the morning or stay up late at night to jot down a few extra sentences
 he also wrote on trips grant could write anywhere on buses trains airplanes but he preferred buses he worked from
 files on his chosen subject through reading research and interviews he collected information which he put in a file when
 the file on a subject became thick enough he began his book he wrote out by hand the first draft
 then transcribed it himself on his royal portable typewriter as he transcribed he revised the text and polished the language
 after a few handwritten corrections off the manuscript went to his publishers grant s lack of analysis his poor documentation
 of sources and his invented dialogue worried some academics but they recognized his extraordinary ability to reach the general reader
 macewan has certainly told a good story in this book although it is not necessarily good history one academic wrote
 of sitting bull 1973 another disliked the author s uncritical approach in charles noble 1983 yet added macewan writes well
 and tells a good story what did grant think of his academic critics if their reviews upset him he never
 mentioned it with just one known exception in a 1984 newspaper article a hint of his discomfort appears in one
 rare outspoken moment the 82 year old author replied to a reporter s question about marie anne his just published
 book on louis rid s grandmother marie anne lagimodière 0:lagimodiere on account of the lack of documentary information grant wrote the
 book in a fictionalized manner he invented several characters and wrote dialogue for them to create a living moving story
 when the reporter asked about the academic community s possible reaction grant replied i don t know what the scholars
 will think of it nor do i really care i m not writing for them i m writing for canadians
 4 well into his eighties the former lieutenant governor kept up his rigorous community commitments as well as his historical
 writing and research one day in early 1986 deserves to be remembered invited to participate in events at edmonton s
 grant macewan community college grant rose in the early hours and boarded a greyhound bus for the four hour trip
 north in edmonton he visited the several college campuses for grant macewan day then asked to be dropped off at
 the edmonton public library to do some research for a few hours just before his hosts returned to drive him
 to the elegant college dinner grant changed his clothes in the library s public washroom as the evening s guest
 speaker he spoke for twenty to twenty five minutes on public service and the life of saskatchewan s tommy douglas

 made a special trip to limerick ireland to check for additional information on paddy s past paddy had always claimed
 his birthday was march 17 st patrick s day 1864 but very clearly the parish baptismal records of st michael
 s church in limerick gave his baptismal date as march 3 1862 grant s mention of this fact contains an
 additional detail which in itself speaks volumes st michael s he found was not a comfortable place in which to
 he accidentally locked on a cold night as the author can testify ‘ he says no more of his night
 in the limerick church after the death of his wife phyllis in 1990 grant s life became quite lonely the
 den in his home on hallbrook drive in southwest calgary became his refuge with magazines papers and books lining the
 walls fromii the floor to the ceiling he published two more books coyote and other humorous tales of the early

 heavily on neglect is somewhat surprising contemporary reviews as a first step toward an assessment of the macewan next came

 least eight printings a year later came fijiy mighty men 1958 easily macewan s most famous title it grew out
 of a series of columns he wrote the sodbusters was macewan s first book for a general audience and served
 as a prototype for many of his future books of biographical sketches i for the western producer and was the
 first the ‘of twenty nine books he published with ‘ their subsidiary prairie books it consisted of a sermes of
 bmogmaphmcal sketches of western canadian pioneers and personalities many of the sketches such grant macewan in 1945 with a copy

 burns later four books published between 1936 and 1945 became full length books others such as all dealt with the
 science of agriculture that of prairie farm rehabilitation beginning in 1948 he switched over to administration director george spence historical
 subjects remain the only pieces written about these figures still others such as louis rid are by the 1950 s
 albertans had become well known even to those with little hungry to read about their own history and books are
 uneven it is this one yet it macewan firmly established himself as one was his best seller and by 1972
 it had sold of the region s leading authors with the 12 000 copies 9 and continued to sell it
 dust jacket for grant s first publication of eye opener bob 1957 went through eight hardcover printings and historical book

 readable and colorful 2 it was reprinted three times before being reissued for calgary s 1975 centennial it has since
 lost classic status mainly because it has been superseded by a cavalcade of other books on calgary s history john
 ware s cow country 1960 is an odd classic the first and only book on this african american cowboy and
 as close as we ll get to him 22 since the advent of civil rights and post colonial theory though
 it is hard to read macewan s portrait particularly the accented dialogue attributed to him without wincing reviewers differed starkly
 on the book s merits it received some enthusiastic receptions and one publication praised it as both a biography and
 a history of ranching in southern alberta 24 but barry broadfoot called it uneven tedious and often fuzzy macewan inflicts
 on john ware a southern darky style of mumbled fractured speech which serves to make ware into a caricature not
 only is it an insult to ware s memory but an insult to the readers intelligence 23 but the ranchers
 macewan interviewed for the book are now long dead making this book the sole repository for their recollections of ware
 it remains in print and popular there have been numerous attempts to make it into a movie macewan s next
 book blazing the old cattle trail 1962 began as a series of articles in the western producer at the time
 this collection of thirty six colourful stories about early livestock drives was hailed as macewan s best book yet 26
 one of his more successful books it went into at least eight printings remained in print into the l 980
 s and was recently reissued the publishers decided not to break the mould with hoofprints and hitchingposis 1964 a collection
 of horse history and lore which had originally appeared in the alberta history i autumn 2001 western producer at times
 hampered by a lack of colourful personalities through whom to tell the stories macewan is in form when he allows
 himself free rein to tell the stories of individual horses and horsemen of the west hoofprints and hitchingposts contained enough

 macewami s son in law and rob sanders his publisher first at prairie books and now at greystone books have
 both stated that this book comes closest to the core of macewan s thinking frank moher said it presents the
 author at his best which is to say his most passionate 28 it was one of the first nonacademic books
 in canada on conservation the first of its kind in almost a decade and the very first book of its
 kind on the prairies reviewed well but sparsely it didn t receive the national attention it merited and had only
 one printing each in its original 1966 edition and the revised 1986 edition nonetheless it remains a definitive statement of
 macewan s values and was pivotal in establishing his reputation as a conservationist and forward thinker not just a chronicler
 of the past later that same year came a lighter hearted detour from macewan s customary agricultural and historical topics
 as a statement of the new lieutenant governor s beliefs poking into politics shows a strong concern for democracy integrity
 in politics and journalism and a liberal dose of his trademark humour part one follows the evolution of democracy from
 ancient athens to social credit part two is mainly amusing anecdotes from his time in politics until the publication of
 journals it was the closest thing to a macewan autobiography john ware an outstanding black cowboy was the subject of
 an essay in fifty mighty men macewan later wrote john ware s cow country published in 1960 ware is seen

 received as a book find the book far too thin on its subject and for these times when the native
 peoples are too thick on the speculative history of pressing for greater autonomy 3 it shows nations unrelated to the

 always my intention that fifty mighty men would have a companion volume it was reprinted often and is still available
 under the perhaps more appropriate title of mighty women when macewan s 1977 book cornerstone colony was published reviews concluded
 that even if he brought forth little new research it was a well told tale of an important chapter in
 western histom y 3 this book said a reviewer attempts to present lord selkirk as western canada s founding farmer
 which strained interpretation gave him an opportunity to re tell the story of the trials and tribulations the small victories
 and the tragedies of the painful establishment of the red river community 34 if there hadn t been a macewan
 best seller since power for prairie plows memory meadows 1977 made up for it to this day his thirty seven
 sketches of some famous and some not so famous canadian horses remains a popular favourite freed from any attempts to
 claim historical significance for its subjects macewan s passion for horses infuses this book this was the first of his
 books to be released as a paperback original and an expanded edition appeared in 1985 macewan s next book the
 rhyming horseman of the qu appelle 1978 dealt with the career of stanley harrison a close friend who shared a
 mutual obsessive love of horses to flesh out harrison s owmi story macewan includes information on the early exploration of
 the qu appelle valley english immigration to the prairies and the history of horse breeding and thoroughbred racing 35 macewan
 s granddaughter fiona foran says that along with marie anne 1984 it was his personal favourite of his books when
 pat burns cattle king was published in 1979 it had a mixed reception either this biography of the meat packing
 magnate was one of macewan s better efforts 36 or the poorest book macewan has ever written 37 whatever its
 canada 1973 which was extensively reviewed and was loved by the popular press the edmonton journal said it was by
 any standards a masterpiece 3 academics questioned macewan s interpretation of facts and his use of questionable material typical is
 the comment macewan has certainly told a good story in this book although it is not necessarily good history 32
 this is calgary 1973 is a macewan curiosity a promotional photo book published for the calgary real estate board co
 operative the text which accompanied tony rankin s photos of the city and its environs is rather dull and macewan
 is not credited anywhere except on the rear dust jacket flap in 1975 three more of macewan s books were
 published these included an updated edition of calgary cavalcade which appeared in the spring along with battle for the bay
 a history of the hudson bay railroad and the port of churchill and the book and mighty women too sketches
 of notable pioneer women the title of the latter book chosen by the publisher sounded like an afterthought and to
 clarify the point macewan wrote in his this is how calgary looked when grant macewan arrived in the early 1950
 s it is a view of eighth avenue looking east from third street west d alberta history autumn 2001 merits
 as a tale it is important historically for its inclusion of information that macewan collected from burns contemporaries and relatives
 soon after the man s death in 1936 grant macewan ‘ s illustrated histo ry of western canadian agriculture 1980
 was another large format book with many illustrations supporting an extensive text a reviewer for books in canada thought it
 dull 38 but others disagreed the lethbridge herald called it a history book written for people who dislike history 3
 neatly confirming macewan s mission as a writer it sold slowly going out of print in july 1985 metis makers
 of history 1981 could have been called eighteen mighty metis though macewan here considered metis a racial rather thami a
 cultural appellation it was a solid book and if some reviewers charged macewan with stereotyping 4 it received generally positive
 reviews and prompted dorine thomas then manager of pemmican publications to write you are givimig a sense of pride to
 the metis and a positive view of our culture to the nonnative reader thank you 4 alberta landscapes a coffee
 table book with photographs by rusty macdonald appeared in 1982 the text serves to illustrate the pictures and is generally
 unremarkable though there appears an occasional macewan quirk such as his call for waterton park to be renamed kootenai brown
 national park this was followed by the best of grant macewan 1982 published to mark the author s 80 th
 birthday it contains excerpts from most of his books to alberta landscapes except the textbooks and this is calgary by
 this time macewan was writing so much that his publisher prairie books could not keep pace with him when they
 decided to move ahead with the best qf macewan has certainly told a good story in this book sifting bull
 although it is not necessarily good history grant macewan and his biography of charles noble he took his latest work
 highlights of shorthorn history 1982 to the canadian shorthorn association to publish they were not a book publisher though amid
 the handsome volume was not widely distributed meanwhile prairie books published charles noble guardian of the soil 1983 which was
 greeted respectfully although noble lacked the spark of roguery that brought macewan s subjects to life on the page said
 one reviewer it was dry as the land noble worked so diligently to preserve 42 sonic criticized macewan s interpretation
 47 but prairie fonmin deemed it a good discussion piece icher than its detractors will claim the author s attempt
 to bring our agricultural past to light and life is a worthy and under emphasized task 4 alberta history autumn
 2001 perhaps macewan realized that farmer certainly increased since the appearance of heroes were too stolid so the subject of
 his frederick haultain frontier statesman of next book wildhorse jack the legend of the canadian west 1985 many reviewers jack
 morton 1983 combined in across the country lauded the book 49 but macewan s words the best characteristics historians were
 critical 50 george hoffman of saints and sinners in the rollicking story asserted that the need for a fuller study
 of an early stampede hero it was remains macewan s book is not a true ecstatically if not widely reviewed
 what measure of haultain s role in the a great tv series this would be one development of the west
 5 this challenge reviewer wrote how wonderful for to historians has gone unanswered canadian children to have a real cowboy
 macewan s book remains the only hero of their own 43 despite such monograph on sir frederick enthusiasm morton s
 prior lack of fame and the fact that the book was not as a substitute for the autobiography he packaged

 to calgary he also became involved with the industry s magazine canadian cattlemen and wrote a regular column for it
 he is seen here at that time in a canadian cattlemen photograph alberta history autumn 2001 macewan s next book
 was to be his last full length biography colonel james walker man of the western frontier 1989 was lightly praised
 in some quarters but in others it was scorned like no other book of his had been since the very
 early days to some reviewers it was a sure winner 2 a great story of an important period in the
 history of western canada and of one man s share in it 53 to others it was popular history at
 its weakest 54 an historical mystery the mystery being why it was ever published in trying to mythologize walker macewan
 had turned him into a plaster saint not good history colonel james walker was unfortunately not a good story either
 perhaps realizing that some of their cheap packaging had hurt sales prairie books went all out for what was to
 be their last macewan book grant macewan ‘ s west sketches from the past 1990 it was a handsome hardcover
 volume dedicated to all canadians who find their history more fascinating than hockey a select group indeed and perhaps not
 an apt dedication for the book is a perfect one to convert those who are more fascinated with hockey than
 history it consists of a series of brief recountings of significant or interesting events in the canadian northwest it has
 all the elements of macewan s classic popular histories brevity humour colour and an abiding concern for the land it
 is one of his best books the summation of a long career in historical storytelling in 1991 the alberta sheep
 and wool commission brought out highlights of sheep history in the canadian west a book macewan had written around 1987
 but publication of which had been delayed like the shorthorn history it was distributed mainly through the commission s channels
 and today it is nearly impossible to find a copy later that year western producer sold its book publishing arm
 prairie books to douglas mcintyre a vancouver based independent publisher ending an era of regional publishing in many minds macewan
 was synonymous with the saskatoon based publisher he had published more books with them than with all other publishers combined
 douglas mcintyre took over prairie books backlist and reissued fifty mighty men mighty women and john ware in 1995 and
 memory meadows in 1997 with prairie books gone macewan found a calgary based publisher for his next book coyote music
 and other humorous tales of the early west 1993 macewan had been collecting bits of prairie humour for most of
 his life many of which ended up between the covers of this book his publisher rocky mountain books chose the
 best bits from a sprawling manuscript organized them loosely into chapters and presented the public with what has become one
 of macewan s best loved books macewan s penultimate book had been completed as ea rly as 1992 but turmoil
 in the book industry a flagging market for local interest books and macewan s declining reputation as an author of
 importance made a publisher difficult to find eventually the alberta sport recreation parks wildlife foundation secured funding from syncrude which
 had been involved in a bison recovery program to produce and publish buffalo sacred and sacrificed 1995 it was a

 books it is hard to tell grant macewan was simultaneously limited and granted a wide and enthusiastic readership by his
 fondness for the captivating anecdote for him the romance of the prairie west was exemplified by such colourful but historically
 inconsequential figures as john ware jack morton stanley harrison and paddy nolan as hilda neatby wrote early on in his
 career his gift is for simple anecdote and for short and colorful descriptions 8 she meant it disapprovingly but macewan

 a pioneer he would have a place in the literary history of the canadian west but because of his unique
 contributions his vision of a gently ribald and proudly heroic west and even his slightly awkward but endearing prose style
 he certainly deserves a place on bookshelves of the land travail with water wells to o b lassiter s scheme

 what are grant macewan s achievements as a writer first he played a large part in creating an awareness of
 western canadian history among the people of the west second he rescued from neglect and sometimes successfully mythologised as in
 the case of john ware otherwise forgotten figures i f it were not for authors like macewan said one reviewer
 much of our history would be left unwritten 7 third he contributed greatly to agricultural history much that he recorded
 no one else did and his agricultural writings are the most likely to transcend the geographical limitations of his subjects
 finally he did what any writer outside academia has to he entertained his readers grant had a smile for everyone
