 reaching the ferry cit the bow for permission to go into the car and river the clear stream looked so
 inviting have breakfast with them but was refused with the answer that travellers that i stripped and plunged in for
 a were not permitted to board there bath but scrambled out quicker as the water was so much colder than

 and every day could never be any larger than it then numbers of western men who had not was in
 fact that when once the railroad seen a locomotive for years and some would pass the town would pass too
 who had never seen it at all rode out i was informed that it was a country to the end

 a weekly mail sermany present looked extravagant vice poured into town very fast the presbyterians and methodists combined about the
 middle of august the news to secure a tent where they held services paper plant arrived and preparations alternately but
 this became too small were made to get out the first issue of for the congregations and each of the
 the paper lumber was very scarce and denominations built a church for themvery high in price and accordingly a selves
 tent 12 x 24 was erected and in this the washington press was set up and the great dissatisfaction was
 felt about first paper printed there was a sub the townsite no one was allowed to scription list of 200
 at the time but 500 build west of the elbow river without copies of the first issue were run off
 and the permission of the police and everyall sold as quickly as they came from one was crying out to

 as there was no change 25 property owners east of the elbow could cents was freely paid and when the
 not give a title for the land and no one issue was exhausted 50 cents and 1 00 wished to
 put up permanent buildings were paid for secondhand single copies the post office had been removed to the premises occupied
 by jas bannerman at this time the mail service was in a and the station to its present location very
 unsatisfactory state the post office this almost created a rebellion and was at the fort and the mail arrived via
 meetings were held and wild denunci fort benton and macleod every three ations made but all to no purpose the

 the carts and baggage we met tribes the location of the americar with very little difficulty or trouble at any
 whiskey forts and the grave necessity time for great distances the rood led over for law enforcement prairie ground almost
 as level as a race course one of the mysteries of his report is reaching fort ellice he found it
 to be the error in placing fort whoop up or a group of poplar log houses surrounded hamilton at the
 wrong site in his diary by a stockade and recommended the he locates it at a point where two small
 placing of fifty soldiers at that point rivers fall into the belly river not far upon reaching the saskatchewan river
 from porcupine hill on the track from the forts at carlton pitt victoria and fort benton to edmonton i make
 out the edmonton proved for the most part to be point to be at the junction of the waterlog buildings
 with stockades about ton and railway rivers with the belly twenty feet high and bastions at the river robertson ross
 was using palangles although probably sufficient to user s map but was somewhat hampered afford protection from indians he cam
 by its errors it does not show st mary mented they are of slight strength river his railway river is
 likely the these forts are conveniently enough castle river and there is confusion situated for purposes of trade but in
 a regarding the locations of the belly and military point of view are badly placed oldman rivers but in spite
 of this robbeing in nearly every instance com ertson ross description was fairly acmanded from the rear by higher curate
 placing whoop up at the conground fluence of the oldman and belly rivers he recommended placing companies this is about
 ten miles from its location of fifty men each at carlton pitt and at the forks of the oldman and
 st mary victoria and 125 at fort edmonton rivers it is at this point sept 7 1872 that however in
 his printed report he the diary begins it is apparent that the ignores his diary and states a party of
 published report was based upon the american smugglers and traders have notes made by robertson ross in his established a
 trading post at the junodiary in only a few cases is there any tion of the bow and the belly
 rivers major variation the party with a new this is almost sixty miles north east of guide left fort edmonton

 of this error the northtion about the whiskey traders they left west mounted police in their westward for wildhorse b

 search for whoop up at the wrong locati ace the exact route and robertson ross tion although their men were
 suffercomments that it was not an established ing from exhaustion and the horses trail however they apparently went dying from
 lack of feed the expedition south east from rocky mountain house went to the forks of the bow and belly
 to the plains and went due south cross ing the bow river west of calgary they diary entry for sept
 16 1872 col p robertson ross was photographed just before he set out on his journey to the west in
 1872 at this time he was adjutant general of the militia of canada now called the oldman rivers expecting to
 encounter the illicit american traders no reason is given by robertson ross for changing this vital piece of information on
 sept 29 th he reached the south end of the porcupine hills about ten or fifteen miles north of pincher
 creek and became enthusiastic about the site as a miuitary base he felt this was an ideau point from which
 to suppress the liquor traffic the establishment of a custom house on the belly river near the porcupine hills he
 stated in his published report with a military guard of about 150 soldiers is all that would be required to
 effect the object not only would the establishment ef a military post here put a stop to this traffic but
 it would also before long be the means of stopping the horse stealing expeditions carried on by hostile indians from
 south of the line into dominion territory which is the real cause of all the danger in that part of
 the country and the source of constant war among the indian tribes indeed lt may now be said with truth
 that to put a stop to horse stealing and the sale of spirits to indians is to put a stop
 altogether to indian wars in the north west the importance of the porcupine hill in a strategical point of view
 is very great commanding as it does the entrance of both the kootenay passes towards the west and the route
 from benton into the saskatchewan territory on the south and east the country con be seen from it for immense
 distances all round although hostile to citizens of the united states it is believed that the blackfeet indians would gladly
 welcome any dominion military force sent to protect them from the incursions of other tribes and to stop the horse
 stealing which has for so long been carried on with excellent judgment they have pointed out the southern end of
 the porcupine hill as the proper place for a military post timber o large size and good quality for building
 is close at hand and the surrounding country is most fertile and favorable for settlement the distance from fort edmonton
 to the porcupine hill is about six or seven days journey on horseback and from the kootenay valley on the
 western side of the rocky mountains from whence supplies could be easily obtained about fifty or sixty miles frequent intercourse
 and an active trade between the kootenay district of british columbia rind the saskatchewan country would result from the establishment
 of a custom house and military post at the porcupine hills many individuals are prepared to settle there if any
 protection is of forded and the indian trade of the country at present tapped by u s smugglers would remain
 with our own countrymen there is a general belief prevalent moreover that valuable gold deposits are to be found near
 the porcupine hills the unsettled state of the country hitherto has not admitted however of much prospecting a party ‘
 of four american miners who crossed through the kootenay pass two or three years ago were all killed by the
 blackfeet near the porcupine hill the moment they entered the plain on the eastern side since which no attempt at
 prospecting for gold has been made in that part of the country much of this information was taken into consideration
 by the n w m p when they came west two years later they were en route to the porcupine
 hills area when their guide jerry potts took them mr b hardisty the officer in charge to the island upon
 which they built fort of the post presses on the necessity for macleod this is some twenty five miles military
 protection there is no security east of the site recommended by robert for life or property here murder is comson
 ross a short time later a police mitted with impunity etc etc etc also farm was established on pincher creek
 whisky selling to indians contrary to directly south of this location law by free traders from the states of this
 there should be an end his prediction regarding the blackfoot indians was quite accurate for the with regard to the
 accommodation of mounted police were welcomed as troops they should be hutted outside friends and horse stealing and whiskey the

 at the back of the hopes for gold discoveries did not ma fort but temporary accommodation terialize although prospectors searched
 could be found for them in the h b the area for a number of years fort for about 6
 officers and 120 men the diary ends at wildhorse b c but sunday sept 8 ih at edmonton raining robertson

 in 1857 59 crossing we took a farewell view of this is the present pipestone creek tam we camped for
 the night at about 1 4 to 6 on the west side of the bear mountain weather very fine we
 saw a wolf today which ran away in front of us into the bush about 600 yards in front of
 us it turns out that we have had a bag containing potatoes and vegetables also some things belonging to monro
 and his daughter stolen by three cree women who crossed the saskatchewan with us at edmonton yesterday in the scow
 rather annoying the place where we camped tonight is only about 3 or 4 miles from the battle river werinesday

 little hoar frost on the ground did not sleep very well being disturbed by the howling of wolves after some
 coffee and bi ead started about 6 a m on foot ahead of the carts and walked till 8 30
 am when the horses came up i got wet up to the knees from walking through the long wet grass
 crossed the battle river about 9 a m and halted for breakfast about 11 30 a m on the wolf
 plain just at the point where the trail separates one trail going south to benton the route which whiskey sellers
 come by the other going west to the rocky mountain house the one we take today the actual point we
 breakfasted at is just where the letter c of the word blackfoot is in butler s map it is a
 pity we cannot go straight to the kootanie from this point as it would save time and distance this point
 might be a good place for a post of communication if soldiers stationed on the bow river we have seen
 no buffalo as yet i fear they are at present all too far out in the plain for us to
 see them at this time of the year our guide monro hunted buffalo along with a party from the r
 mountain house here where we now are last winter on the wolf plain and they killed 20 of them wolf
 plain where we halted is considered by the half breeds to be half way between edmonton and the rocky mountain
 house and apparently is about 10 or 12 miles from the red deer hills we left wolf plain at 1
 30 p m and proceeded on till 7 30 p m through a very fertile and pretty country when we

 soon became very hilly and antelope but missed it on reaching the about 4 p m it first came on
 to rain and bow river it came on sleet and snow then to snow and soon it was cold and
 bad weather so we camped for the enough but we proceeded on till about night 5 30 p m when
 we camped for the night friday sept 20 th this is the anniver in a small valley close to the
 foot of sary of the battle of alma what changes porcupine hill but nearer the rocky since then ah me
 rose about 5 am mountains we had barely pitched our beautiful morning calm and serene after little tent and crawled

 22 nd snowed up at the foot shining brightly a glorious sight we of the rocky moaritains somewhere about started
 from camp at 8 30 am not being latitude 50 close to the porcupine hill able to manage to get
 off sooner just and about 10 or 12 miles south west of as we were starting our indian guide the
 ispasquehow river a favourite benjamin took offence at something wintering place of the blackeet indians and went off in a
 huff apparently mean ihe prospect today is not cheery monroe ing to desert but we took no notice of him
 and went off without him and before moose creek is the present elbow river see we had crossed the bow
 river he had place names of alberta p 47 while sweet come back we had some difficulty in creek is
 likely the present fish creek finding a ford and when we crossed our 3 nose hill is located on the
 north western outfeet were wet and cold so we had to skirts of calgary while moose hill is a high
 chcxnge our boots and socks water up elevation at the west end of the sarcee indian reserve to saddle girths
 water very cold we this is the black oot term for the highwood passed moose creek 2 and sweet river
 says we cannot possibly cross the moun with only our pack and saddle horses tains for at least four or
 five days yet i am loath to give up the idea of attemptas the snow must be at least two
 and ing to cross the kootanie for surely one half feet deep there here we have this cannot be winter
 already aitho all it down on the plains a foot deep this around is a day snow now about two
 feet morning and it is still snowing steadily deep patience and perseverance this is hard just as we are reaching
 the pass to find ourselves snowed up but shortly before 1 p m i happened to we hope for fine
 weather yet 12 30 p m look out ol our little camp and 1 i saw no improvement in the
 weather as yet a large grizzly bear coming towards us prospect of getting across the rocky wading through the snow
 i was not mountains appears bad monroe the more than 50 yards off i instantly gave guide seems doubtful and
 talks of our the alarm and got hold of hugh s remaking for fort benton if snow is too volver
 benjamin the stoney indian deep to attempt to cross 3 20 p m no was the first man ready after
 myself but improvement in the weather still he spoilt the fun at this moment being ing but it is not
 very cold the wind frightened i suppose by firing too soon seems abating and there is a decided otherwise i
 have no doubt the animal tendency to thaw most sincerely do would have come right on our little hope it
 will come on to thaw and clear camp which was half buried in the up have held some conversation with
 snow as soon as benjamin fired the monroe and our present idea is if the bear turned and made off
 i fired three weather will admit to try and move on shots in succession at it with the tomorrow in
 the direction of the koot revolver as it was making off but withenais pass and camp in some wood till
 out effect the snow being very deep the the snow has disappeared and then bear could not go fast through
 it so we 1 practicable make an effort to cross the got our horses and accompanied by mountains failing we
 shall try to make hugh monroe and benjamin we folfor fort benton on the missouri i think lowed the animal
 which took refuge in we have about 12 or 14 days provisions a patch of bushes about 2 or 400
 yards with us with care and our fate will be from the camp surrounding the bush we decided before then
 hugh is well so am shouted and fired several shots in to the i and we are tolerable cheery under
 the bushes which had the effect of bringing circumstances the place where we are out the bear to the edge
 of the bush close now snowed up is between the ispas to where i was with hugh and benjamin quehow
 sipi and old man s river all sitting quietly on our horses benclose to the base of the porcupine hills
 iamin saw the bear first and fired with but on the side towards the mountains his flint gun a useless
 weapon missing ground very hilly all round about and i then got a fair shot at it with my bare
 we have got plenty wood and do snider carbine the animal being not not suffer much from cold except in
 our more than 10 or at most 12 yards from feet me but much concealed in a thick bush i
 felt sure my ball had struck having monday sept 23 rd still snowed up no taken a steady aim and
 the animal sign up to this hour 9 am of weather improving it snowed all last night and is now
 steadily snowing prospect very 32 this river is mentioned bv such early travellers gloomy as peter fidler david thompson and

 and monroe all armed to the monroe and myself he saw the bear teeth and prepared for grizzlies i lying
 dead where i had fired at it but sallied out to reconnoitre the neighbourto make sure monroe fired again into
 hood on horseback we proceeded it calling out to me however at the time about two miles from camp to
 the top that the animal was already dead and of a hill the snow up to our horses knees so
 it was and constantly going through where it had drifted up to the saddle girths on it turned out to
 be a very large gaining the summit of the hill the finest grizzly bear ci she bear and is a
 great view i ever saw in my life burst upon our prize on skinning and cutting up the view there
 close to us not more than animal we found my bullet in it which about 15 miles off lay the
 g orious rocky had struck the bear between the shoul mountains lowering above us covered ders and passing downward through
 his deep with snow and as far as the eye ribs had gone right through the heart could see the
 plains covered with the killing the animal instantly it was same white mantle i never saw so grand very lucky
 shot and one i feel rather a spectacle it was worth coming all the proud of hugh behaved very well
 in way to see it to cross them at present deed and does not seem the least frightened of what
 is considered hereabouts seems impossible but the weather may improve if we had dogs and sleighs we the most dangerous
 sport monroe and might do it i think or on snowshoes i benjamin skinned the grizzly which i saw numerous
 tracks of wolves in the hope to preserve as a trophy and cut up snow and some of the jumping
 deer we the animal for meat and we were back have ascertained exactly where we are in camp with the
 work all done and at and we are really somewhat in a fix our dinner at 3 p m much
 pleased with being at the entrance of the valley north our good fortune both hugh and i were side which
 divides the porcupine range amazed at the size and strength of the of hills from the mountains and we are
 grizzly which monroe tells me is a fine actually just at the fool of the rocky specimen of an old
 grizzly when ben mountains about half way from the jamin fired monroe tried to do so also rocky mountain house
 and the kootbut something went wrong with his anie but it is not easy to travel with rifle a sixteen
 shooter and at the critical horses if possible at all we are about moment it would not go off he
 called 200 or 250 mfles from any help unless out to me to lend him my revolver ex we make
 for a point about 100 miles off pecting that ihe bear was about to where some american outlaws are said
 charge at us i handed him the revolver to be trading i e smuggling with the and then leveling my
 carbine fired the indians or we might meet with indians shot which ended the career of poor and as long
 cis we have monroe with us bruin altogether i am rather a proud feel sure they will do us no
 harm my man today present idea is to wait quietly here for in the afternoon the weather cleared two or
 three dciys to see how the weather up and it became fine in the evening is but i can only
 judge day by day the stars came out but oh what a wintry hugh is in excellent spirits and i
 could scene at night benjamin the stoney not only have a pluckier or better corntreated us to the indian bear
 song amid panion i hope monroe will keep up i the dismal howlings of which i laid may have to
 wait a fortnight or three down to steep with hugh rolled up in weeks before attempting to cross those a
 buffalo robe alongside me giant mountains altogether it is a re iilar fix and we have got here at least

 draft locomotive for propelling freight wagons across the plains to the rocky mountains has just been completed it was built
 on c ntract for major i r brown of minnesota and weighs about fourteen tons in its trial with 140
 pounds of steam it went steadily up a very rough unpaved gul 1 ied street having a grade of scme
 ten feel in 150 it is intended for draft rather than speed and its principal novelty is the arrangement and
 use of a portable rai 1 oad track which it carries with ii the inventors of this machine have sanguine
 hopes that it may open the way for steam locomotion on common roads and should it not end in smoke
 like the celebrated cigar shaped stectmboat we may shortly expect to see it puffing its way through the settlement en

 owner 0 a store and manager of 11101 icr and liwl devoted more than thirty yea s to church work
 however he gave up all he had when asked to open a new frontier on the prairies o canada in
 the year 1887 a small group of aware of the knowledge the latter day latter day saints left their homes
 in saints had of irrigation and were utah to seek new homes charles ora anxious to interest settlers in the
 land card was their leader accompanied by the church authorities wanted more of his wife aunt zina who was a
 daughter their people to take advantage of this of brigham young they travelled for new land so they entered into
 a contract some time crossed the border into can with the alberta railway and coal co ada and finally found
 a place that to construct an irrigation canal from st pleased them in alberta near lees mary river to a
 point in their railway creek later called cardston here they called stirling 20 miles iroin lethbridge settled and were happy
 and others settlers were needed and the contract joined them on this great grass covered stipulated that by the 31
 st day of decemprairie in due time some of the leaders ber 1899 there were to be 350 people visited
 their saints in this far north and located in each of three settlements or liked what they saw the seasons
 were townsites to create an interest and to long no forests to clear and for miles show the advantage of
 locating in this the entire landscape was covered with country the church called h s jacobs to i ciii dry
 grass there were a few ranches travel through utah telling of the need scattered through this vast area but no
 of men to assist in building the canal farming except the little that had been done by the saints who
 felt that good this proved unsuccessful and the situcrops should be raised if water were ation looked serious when it
 was decided available the nearest settlement was to call men and families to canada to lethbridge 50 miles away formerly
 work on the canal the men were to be called coal banks because of the great paid for their work
 in part cash and part coal deposits found there mines were land scrip the land to cost them 3 00
 in operation and a local railroad had per acre my father theodore brandley been built by the gait interests who
 of richfield utah was one of the first were in charge of the mines to transport so called and was
 to interest others to coal to great falls montana the organ join him he was to take with him all
 ization was called the alberta railway necessary livestock household effects and coal company these people were machinery etc to start
 a new home for his family in this new land this was to be a different kind of mission to
 those he had filled he never wavered for a moment but when he received the letter telling him of his
 call and was asked what he would do he said i have never refused a call the church has made
 of me and will not do so now he retired from all his positions sold his furniture store collected the
 things necessary or that would be needed and prepared to start life anew the most difficult decision that had to
 be made was that his wife margaret felt she could not undertake the hardships of pioneer life as she was
 not at all well so it was decided that she and her kimily would remain in richfield for at least
 a time april found everything pretty well under control and there were now 30 persons ready to take the trip
 they were my father his children theodore henry albert joseph me and his wife eliza sister rirsche her sons sam
 alfred will and sister mary and her husband and children two christensen boys from elsinore paul zaugg chris peterson chris
 larsen herman grether hans and elmer mcirquardson april 27 th found all ready for the trip some of the men
 were to drive the live stock to nephi where they were to be loaded into stock cars the rest of
 the group was to take the train from richfield we travelled to butte montana where the coach was sidetracked for
 several hours the next stop was great falls and here all our effects livestock and all else had to be
 transferred to the narrow gauge train a local from lethbridge three standard cars held all effects but when transferred to
 the small narrow gauge it took 18 cars after leaving next stop was coutts the international boundary there was nothing
 here but a tent in which the customs officer and immigration officer one man held both positions was housed he
 came from his tent to have our cars sealed and everything placed in bond until we reached stirling all day
 long the train slowly wended its way through tall dry grass not a tree or shrub to be seen just
 like endless miles of grass covered prairie the group was very tired and dreamed of a theodore brandley taken in
 lethbridge on dec 7 1915 at the age of sixty four years good night s rest at last in the
 distance we saw a large dark object which proved to be the section house and station president charles ora card
 was there to welcome father and the group to their new home it was 9 p m on that 5
 th day of may but light as day the lingering rays of a beautiful sunset had tinted the sky with
 wonderful colors we were unaccustomed to the long twilight hours of this far north and as we left the train
 our hearts were filled with emotion in this strange land where there was nothing but endless miles of dry grass
 gently waving in the breeze with no houses or buildings except the station president card had driven his horses and
 democrat over 50 miles to welcome us and advised us that mrs morrison would care for us for the first
 night she and mr morrison had recently arrived from scotland to take charge of the station and care for the
 men working on the railway we had dreams of a comfortable bed but were surprised when shown our rooms and
 found we cheap but flour was 6 00 per hundred wore to have but one large room furn pounds while
 ham was only 25 cents per ished with six bunks made of rough pound boards with no covering of any
 kind mrs morrison placed a small kerosene sir e t gait and c a magrath lamp on a crude table
 and was sorry heads of the albert a railway and coal she had nothing better for us but hoped company
 came from lethbridge to welwe would rest well when the light was come father and to ask him to open
 a cut cold objects fell on our hands and small store for the convenience of the faces and when the
 lamp was lighted people they also asked him to assist the we found the ceiling and walls had men working
 on the canal in selecting large dark patches from which bedbugs the lands earned for their work the were falling
 needless to say we spent land was to be 3 00 per acre after the night under the stars learning
 of the water situation they assured father that they would have the north west mounted police were tanks of drinking
 water sent from lethto come from lelhbridge to break the bridge and placed on a siding near the seals and
 release our effects but they station for our use until wells could be had not yet arrived so we had
 not even dug a coat out of bond next morning president card took most of the group to the church
 had stored a pile of lumshow father where he was to establish ber near the railway for the erection the
 new village after walking for one of six two roomed houses to be built by and one half miles he
 said brethren carpenters or men sent from cardsfon here you may select your lots where you the houses were to
 be sold to the settlers will build your homes father then for 150 each which covered the cost of asked
 about the water situation so we materials and labor on may 10 th some walked farther to what was called
 a of the men broke a little land about a coulee a small sluggish stream of water mile away to
 plant grain and on may with potholes where there was insect 11 th we awakened to a landscape coylife this
 was to be the water we would ered with snow on may 13 th the men have until wells could
 be dug this except father who was to care for the water had to be strained several times families of
 the men working on the and then boiled before it could be used canal left with 14 teams and necessary
 and had to be hauled from the coulee equipment to the pot hole where father in barrels to each tent
 had taken ci sub contract on the canal returning to the station we found the on may 14 th there
 was more snow and n w m police in their colorful red coats frost but a meeting was held in
 the first they released everything broke the unfinished house which was sold to seals and father organized the trek to

 24 th and moved into the first house two days later our first meeting with father in charge was held
 under a wagon cover before going to the pot hole the men stretched between two hay racks and had tried
 digging wells and while some the birds assisted with the singing on water was found it was too salty to
 may 7 th we awakened to a landscape drink a shallow well was then dug near covered with snow which
 soon melted the coulee with better results but still cr d may 8 th father and the men of the
 not too good the company finally sent group drove to lethbridge to make legal a well digging m a c
 h i n e and better entry into the country and to bring back water was found a chicken coop
 was coal and groceries they found coal also built so that we might have eggs and the jersey cows father
 brought from guests and later made his home their utah supplied much of the milk headquarters for that part of
 the church they were anxious that the people be the church had men as well as fam encouraged to remain
 in the country ilies from utah and idaho to assist in the work of the canal and they now began
 when it was learned that lord minto coming in some by train and others the governor general of canada and
 driving overland father had been asked his party were to pay us a visit and that by the church to
 meet the trains each we were to prepare lunch for them there night and to greet all who came so
 was great excitement as none of the each evening cit 9 o clock he could be group had ever entertained
 royalty a found at the station extending a wel meeting was held with lather presiding come hand to all he
 was also to provide and it was decided that although there a place for them to sleep the first night
 were few frying chickens we must have and breakfast the next morning at times fried chicken henry schutt who had
 there were as many as 25 men come in on been an anglican minister in england one train next morning
 mother brand was asked to make all necessary arley would prepare breakfast for that rangements for their entertainment number in
 a very small kitchen hardly every family contributed what chickens large enough for a range and table the they could
 spare and the ladies supplied men would eat in relays with mother the other foods the clark family had cooking
 the bacon or ham and eggs beautiful singing voices and they as cereals biscuits or home made bread well as
 others were to supply the music butter and plenty of milk while i washed while mother brandley was to yodel
 the dishes and kept the table set fcr each the day came and the party was entergroup all this father
 did without charge tamed royally they were delighted and the men left for their work on the with the luncheon
 and when leaving canal feeling that all was well lord minto told father that they were amazed that so much
 could be done by stirling given that name in honor so few with so little and was loud in his
 of lord stirling of scotland soon be praise of the entertainment provided came quite a tented village with a few
 houses on june 17 th rain fell and it many new settlers had now arrived soon became a deluge which
 lasted for from utah and idaho among whom were two weeks the canvas of the tents a daughter of president
 brigham young could no longer shed water and it m hardy and daughter of president poured through onto the beds
 and every winder married to mark croxall father thing else despite the tubs and pails was anxious that a chapel
 be built and used to try to stay it beds were soaked with the united effort of the people in
 the grass floors of the tents were covered village giving all their spare time as with inches of water flour
 and sugar in well as every dollar they could spare a 100 pound sacks were water soaked and building was
 erected and finished by the ruined as there was no place to keep end of the year the first meeting
 held them from the rain all foods except was january 1 sf 1900 those in tin cans were soaked and
 unfit to eat so all our meals were eaten from most of the families were in houses before the end
 of the year but some still cans under umbrellas this was quite a test of faith to some but when
 the rain were in tents the work progressed finally deared and the sun came out despite fears that the contract
 could not not even a cold resulted from it all the be completed in the specified time but prairies was
 beautiful after the rain and it was completed and the company was wild flowers were everywhere so pleased with father
 s part that they asked him to take a contract for twelve among the many who came from utah miles
 of the railroad they were planning was a carpenter h p christensen who to build from stirling to cardston this
 built father a store with bedrooms in came as a surprise to him he had no the rear also during
 the summer ci barn one to go his bond but sir e t gait and was built of slabs apostle
 john w c a magrath hastened to tell him that taylor and mathias cowley came from no bond was required
 from him as his salt lake and were frequently father s word was to them as good as any bond
 by 1900 stirling was beginning to take on the appearance of a permanent settlement although there were still some tents
 on the skyline homes and burns and large haystacks showed the development whkh had been made since theodore brund 1
 ey s party arrived two years earlier he was happy to take the contract and built by some of the
 men aiso a tithing felt it was an answer to prayer owing to granery was built and the money thus
 the frequent rains the men had been earned helped materially when it was learned that men were wanted to cut
 unable to make much money as they timbers for railway ties in the crowsnest had hoped and father feared there
 would pass a few of them took advantage of be suffering during the coming winter this their pay being 1
 00 per day from money was scarce and this work was daylight to dark surely the answer father took the
 contract which proved to be a very difficult father and mother drove to cardston experience for him all the money
 earned during the summer to conferences and was divided equally among the men meetings he was the head and everyaccording
 to the number of days worked one in stirling depended on him for adwith father reserving little or nothing for
 vice and help there were no doctors himself the contract was filled the work among our people and with lethbridge
 being completed in the time specified twenty miles away all had to depend wholly upon the lord and each home
 the gardens grew and vegetables had its bottle of oil now that we had a were very good the grain
 that had been building in which to meet and to worplanted grew and was eaten off three ship we were
 very happy the first wintimes but enough wheat was harvested ter was not too severe and father felt for seed
 it was threshed by flail the that proqress had been made spring wheat being placed on a wagon cover came
 early in 1900 with some aid from and flailed out with clubs or sticks the church and the help of
 all the men president card spent much of his time eight sections of land were fenced so travelling the prairie
 trails to cheer the that all who wished could plant some people many of the men were home grain it
 was a community project and sick they had worked hard and were even though the grain was eaten off durselecting
 the land they wished to buy ing the summer enough wheat was with the land scrip earned for their work
 raised for seed and was again flailed many fine people from utah and idaho out this project proved to be
 a great joined us and our village became a blessing to the people of stirling the happy one father was
 untiring in his year 1900 was very dry coyotes roamed efforts to please cdl and to assist in every the
 prairie and their mournful howls beway he could a railway station was caine familiar to the settlers fire haz ards
 were great at times the settlers payment said yes i have the money were called out to light the prairie
 fires and want you to tell me what to do with father was chosen as a councillor to it shall
 i pay my tithing or shall i pay president card when the alberta stake you what i owe you father
 was was organized travelling by horse bishop drawn democrat for a distance of fifty the year passed pleasantly new miles
 for meetings wasn t too easy but homes were built and the church had father was always on time new
 settlers now built two duplex houses of two arrived almost daily and father met rooms each that were sold to
 the setthem all to welcome them to their new tlers the first automobile that we had land and home some
 remained in stirl ever seen was driven from lethbridge ing while others went on to the new by the owners
 gait and magrath it settlements of raymond and magrath was a queer looking machine with brass being pioneers in a
 strange land and gear shift a horn on the side and could far away from friends and the comforts travel
 five miles per hour of life at that time became quite a prob father s health began to break under
 lem for some but father did all he could the strain of work and the company in to make them
 appreciate the wonderful lethbridge was quite concerned so opportunities of this country when a friend from montreal a dr some
