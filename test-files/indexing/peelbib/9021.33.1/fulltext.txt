 between several intoxicated members of the royal north west mounted police and a couple of respectable citizens has been the
 principal topic of discussion in town ever since the offending members of the mounted police have all been dealt with
 and punished by their superior officers it appears that last wednesday morning a detachment of the lethbridge force brought a
 number of prisoners to the macleod barracks and were returning to lethbridge by the train leaving just after ten in
 the evening constables smyth and thomas of macleod went to the station to see them off and on their arrival
 in the vicinity of the station started to behave in a most disorderly manner previous to the trouble at the
 station the same constables are reported to have got in a mixup with a man who gave his name as
 james ross and his address as hanley sask since ross left town the next day without having made any complaint
 to the authorities information concerning what happened to him must necessarily be second handed ross story as told to shorty
 holder of the american hotel and mr johnston of the advertiser staff was to the effect that he had been
 accosted by the constables who asked him how much money he had he produced his roll which amounted to 38
 and one of the constables knocked it out of his hand scattering the bills however he recovered every dollar of
 the money ross did not suggest nor has it been suggested by anyone concerned that there was any intention on
 the part of the constables to take the money it was the act of a bunch of drunken roisterers it
 was bad enough but it was not robbery ross also stated that the constable took an uncorked bottle of whisky
 from him after the affair was over the constables went on to the cpr platform and there met james mcbride
 of the empire hotel staff constable smyth introduced mcbride to one constable and when the man refused to tell mcbride
 his name the latter would not shake hands with him this led to a few words and mcbride was struck
 a severe blow in the face and knocked to the ground he quickly recovered his feet and single handed proceeded
 to go for the constables and succeeded in felling one or more of them he was getting badly handled when
 edward greenwood a wellknown resident of the town came on the scene and enquired from mcbride what the trouble was
 about greenwood was then struck a blow in the face and at once removed his overcoat and knocked down the
 man who hit him he then closed with another constable and they both fell to the ground and while on
 the ground greenwood received a kick in his right eye which partially dazed him after receiving further rough treatment greenwood

 senators and members of the house of his widowed mother however he was unsettled commons was hearing indian leaders give
 their and unhappy for he was ambitious and wanted views on indian administration and the indian act when the value
 of the residential schools was under discussion one of the committee members observed you can lead a horse to water
 but you can t make it drink the chairman started to explain this to the blackfoot indian on the stand
 but he was cut short by the man who remarked with a smile i know that saying very well in
 this instance there was no water to drink when we got there this was from the lips of teddy yellow
 fly a councillor of the tribe theodore yellow fly was born on march 7 1898 his mother was a blackfoot
 and his father a chinese who lived at high river some 50 miles west of the reserve to this union
 had been born a boy and a girl when the man became ill the woman was obliged to return to
 the reserve and there she married yellow fly who was proud to accept the children as his own and to
 give them his name the chinese father was also proud of them and shortly before his death he bought a
 small herd of cattle for yellow fly to hold in trust for them young teddy attended the anglican boarding school
 until he was fourteen by which time he had long since absorbed all the formal education tedd ‘ ello fly
 as a student that this school could impart after he was discharged he took a position of interpreter and office
 boy at the indian agency he associated more education and a different life to the one freely with the indian
 agent s family and was offered by these old people he watched for a given books to read for he
 had an intense cray chance to get away from it ing for knowledge he was bright and his brain this
 finally occurred when the provincial worked like a trip hammer government expanded its agricultural college pro but as he grew
 to manhood his parents de gram earlier schools had been opened throughmanded more and more of him when he was
 nineteen old yellow fly arranged a marriage for the author was long time indian agent on the the boy and
 he had to accept the ultimatum the blackfoot reserve he wrote this and other stories girl was delicate and on

 foster father died 1950 s and l 960 s he died in 1977 10 out alberta to give boys and
 girls with limited be found but teddy s craving for knowledge education an opportunity to improve their knowl overruled his
 better judgement and he agreed edge these institutions were so well accepted he could now attend the college that in
 1920 a large school was erected at the fall term was momentous and critical for gleichen near the blackfoot reserve
 teddy saw the young indian he was introduced into a new his opportunity and pleaded with me as the world
 of thought his english vocabulary was newly appointed indian agent to ascertain if his limited for one gets but little
 in grade five he application to attend would be accepted for encountered unknown words and expressions in tunately the principal
 was sympathetic and so literature but by studying their meanings he intrigued by the brightness of this young indian translated
 the thoughts into blackfoot such subthat he agreed to enroll him as a day pupil jects as biology botany and
 zoology came easier teddy was overjoyed but he still had to find when he could see the specimens indians knew
 money for his expenses the school was nearly anatomy and the process of growth of plants and a mile north
 of the indian agency and twelve bugs algebr a was different for there was miles from the gunny crow farm
 he needed nothing in blackfoot to compare with it teddy lodgings within walking distance and funds for had not yet
 learned to think in english and the his fees at the moment he had neither the process of mental translation
 nearly ended his blackfoot at that time had large band funds from scholastic career finally he created new which many
 services to band members were blackfoot words which clarified the algebraic financed but nothing had ever been expended terms and
 by the end of the year he had a good on higher education this was seen as a federal working
 knowledge of all his subjects he didn t responsibility jealously guarded by the govern make good marks but he had
 not failed ment with very little financial assistance being during the winter term he entered into the given for educating
 indian children outside the social and non curricular activities of the college church run residential schools in any event ap
 and became a popular student at the finals in p lications for assistance had to be submitted to april he
 topped his class in many subjects and the government a year before they were required outdid other farm boys in
 the farm planning and in this instance it was needed immediately farm management examinations the elder indians who made up
 the band coun teddy had been allotted a farm of 160 acres cil did not favour formal education and hated
 the on the reserve while he was at college and in 1921 residential schools which their children were a fine
 set of buildings were erected for him he forced to attend as a result they were not moved there after
 his exams and never returned prepared to petition the indian department to use to school their band funds for the
 erstwhile student but i must confess that his head was now a bit too teddy and i would not take
 defeat so readily and large for his hat but i still had faith in him and we appealed direct to
 d c scott the deputy when the death of a councillor left a vacancy superintendent of indian affairs for a
 loan of i was glad when teddy was chosen to fill it he 200 from band funds this was barely
 sufficient made a good councillor and retained the position to meet fees buy books and get the very throughout the
 rest of hs life but his education necessary odds and ends we put up a good case did not end
 entirely with the college courses and the loan was approved during the winter of 1922 23 he took a short
 the nearest indian home that could accept course on electricity at the southern alberta in teddy was 2 ½ miles
 from the college the stitute of technology in calgary and obtained the distance meant little to ted but the conditions
 highest marks in the class he lived at the ymca under which he would be accepted into this home during
 term and was mildly lionized in some had a significant effect on his future life the quarters owner was an
 old patriarch named many guns by this time he had become a fairly good and he had three daughters the
 two elder girls speaker and his repartee appealed to whites parwere bright and comely he had bargained well ticularly the
 ladies his wife stayed at home for when they were married the youngest a girl the babies were coming this
 was an annual event named jane was ver y dull plain and had not for some years she tried to
 be a good wife and attended school many guns would board teddy housekeeper and did better than many but she
 in his home only if he married the girl two was no companion for ted he always became persons more
 unsuited to each other could rarely depressed when forced to remain at home he 11 a l e t f
 always talk well but he rarely put into practice the good ideas that flowed from his lips his annual income
 seemed to be sufficient and ‘ s had an income from the sale of beef cattle belong 7 ing to
 the herd started by his chinese father and from the sale of the odd horse from the herd left by
 yellow fly k ‘ teddy was a most valuable councillor since he was the only member who understood finan a
 l cial matters the income from the blackfoot w t land fund and the annual revenue from leases ‘ 9
 v ‘ had to finance all services on the reserve at that time no public funds were being provided to
 assist the blackfoot great care had to be taken ‘ ‘ in budgetting and yellow fly assisted me in explaining
 the problems to the other councillors j i i and obtaining a favourable vote for the expendi w j 5
 ithout him this would have been ‘ 1 k although his services were much appreciated ‘ 4 ‘ i by
 both the indians and me he was always ‘ 1 edd elio s f i was a minor chief on
 the blackloot v hen caught between two forces he was never fully photographed by fern gully at the calgary stampede
 accepted by the full bloods so he never dared to cross them on the other hand i favoured him and
 pay the miners and he was good at his job as much as possible without creating open he set up
 a fine bookkeeping system by which jealousy but only on the understanding that he every pound of coal and every
 cent received and did not deceive me or let himself fall into total paid out could be accounted for it
 was so intridisgrace but then he started to drink and was cate that treasury branch auditors could not able to
 retain his position of councillor only by balance the books the auditor general reprethe skin of his teeth on many
 occasions for sentatives then made a try to do so and failed until tunately for him the indians did not
 consider teddy explained the system to them drunkenness a serious offence while the many in 1927 judge j w howay
 well known policemen and magistrates apparently took a british columbia historian and president of the lenient attitude where teddy was
 involved canadian historical association met yellow fly when radios became popular teddy not only at the unveiling of an historical
 monument cornowned one but spoke over the air with increas memorating the signing of treaty seven howay ing frequency and

 this was my present objective everything was strange to me as i had never been away from 1 home before
 making conversation with a seatmate he informed me he too was on his way to bankhead and planned to get
 work as a carpenter he also had neither baggage nor tools as we approached the bankhead junction i was treated
 to my first acquaintance with men who worked their way ie hoboes or others seek ing free passage as we
 rolled along without a sign of slowing up suddenly first one then another man came flying off the train rolling
 over and over in the deep snow my companion informed me that these men had been riding the james l
 mitchell is seen here as a businessman inan 3 blind the coach had a door on the front years after
 his hobo adventures which was seldom used it was inset and would accommodate two men standing close together tedious work

 was made into briquettes these money and silver an accountant was there and found sale all over the west so
 used up the great each worker got his dues men soon disappeared piles of slack which were to be seen
 at other leaving only the mining staff and number of mines along the road regulars i threw in with another
 young man and the coal cars were moved in and out of the we bought tickets for golden b c
 mine with electric motors as the cars came out we arrived there about nine o clock in the and dumped
 their load the motor moved them evening and right away i realized we were among back into the mine then
 waited at a switch for a different class of people they spoke the same another motor coming out on one
 particular language as we did but in a somewhat different morning the ingoing motor did not make the tone and
 some dressed differently a number of switch when the outcoming motor heaved in young men wore short trousers and they
 seemed sight the motorma n could not avoid a crash and to be engaged in some sort of wrestling match
 jumped in time to save himself as his motor there was a japanese there also in short trousers crashed into
 the standing train of empties there and the whites were being warned not to engage was quite a spill and
 the superintendent was much him as he was a judo wrestler the white boys enraged as he viewed the crash
 turning on the scoffed at it but did no real wrestling with him pale motorman he shouted you could have

 beside me we go home to finally going to sleep under a table day he said his eyes gleaming brightly

 face had turned black back to bankhead as i had money on deposit there no further word was spoken as
 he turned away and that was the last i saw of golden we met again a year or so later
 tony was back in bankhead early in 1905 there was difneatly dressed and going east he had learned ficulty in
 withdr awing the money in deposit in the barber trade and was going home to be the post office while
 waiting for it a section 15 boss of an extra gang engaged me to fill in in the cab of
 his engine and to catch his train as his number of men he hired me on at 2 25 a
 it was pulling out in the morning this took me day which was satisfactory but some of the men to
 donald after a good dinner a passenger came resented a new man coming on as they expected along but i
 failed to make it once more a long one of them would be laid off walk took me up a
 steep grade to spend the night some time later it was rumoured that our job in a sand house where
 sand is dried for use on was finished at banlthead we were given a day the steel r ails to
 assist the engines in climbing to wash and clean up and a number of us were the steep grade this
 is the rogers pass grade ushered into the of fice and paid off not in the station agent was not
 too pleased to see money but a statement of days employed to be me so after a good warm up
 i proceeded on my honoured at the cpr station at banff way soon a freight came along ver y slowly
 and in the meantime my money in the post office the fireman called to me to jump on he wished
 had not come through so i ordered it to be sent me to help him shovel coal sharing his lunch
 to enderby b c where i expected to show up with me that took me to revelstoke here i soon
 washed up and met some fellows that had worked after a few days the pay cheque did arrive in with
 me and had no more finances than i then banff but when i reached for mine it was made i
 caught a freight to sicamous out for 1 75 cents a day angered i threw the the night was mild
 and after getting off i cheque back and walked out a clerk followed walked south a number of miles and
 came to a me to ask what was wrong when i told him i stable with no horses but lots
 of hay the next had been hired for 2 25 per day he said that s morning i walked into
 enderby my money had all i would ever get the others had accepted arrived but the postmaster required identifica 1
 75 and it was useless for one to ask for more tion a family i knew lived a short distance
 away this later proved to be a fact i swallowed my so later in the day i walked out there
 were four pride and accepted the cash sons in the family who had been house building after paying my hotel
 bill in an upset frame the summer before but had contr acted too of mind i started walking west leaving
 my suit cheaply and were now living on a restricted diet case in the hotel after 20 miles the only
 course of beans bread and butter they were now seemed to be to keep on walking stopping to making cord
 wood and claimed to be making build fires and rest i stumbled into laggan too money but i had my
 doubts after a few days late for breakfast after a good dinner a freight of bean eating as there was
 no work to be had came along and i swung aboard a coal car and i bought a ticket to
 kamloops started to work my way to enderby why kamloops kamloops was bare cold and the road from laggan to
 field is a very steep frozen it had no appeal to me and there was no gr ade at places
 there are switch breaks so work to be had walking down the long street that a train with two or
 more locomotives if it that comprised most of the town a freight went becomes stalled can back up into one
 of these crawling by and i naturally swung aboard at switches until it gets a full head of steam again
 lytton the snow was deep and the weather cold and tries once more to make the grade hanging on between
 cars is not the warmest of some time before i passed by a train pushing places up the grade had
 become stalled and started to up above was the small end door of the car slip back the engineers whistled
 for an open but the door was sealed something had to be switch but the switch tender was too late
 fran done so reaching up i broke the seal opened the tically he called for the next switch which was
 door and crawled in closing the door behind me opened but by now the train was slipping fast it was
 cold enough in there at first but after a into the switch it went and right over the end of
 time i went to sleep awakening at the next diviit there was an awful mess of cars rails and sion
 it was quite dark the end door seemed to engines have disappeared so i settled down for another it was
 here that the coal carl was riding in was sleep among churns and washing machines dropped off possibly there was
 employment upon wakening crows were cawing and day was waiting there for me but by now my thought was breaking
 after many short stops the train came to get to enderby to a halt we were in vancouver the end
 of the it did not take long to get to field in the line roundhouse there an engineer told me
 to sleep looking out i saw a railroad man who told me 16 the first job which mitchell obtained when
 he left home was at the bankhead mine near banff seen here in 1912 to come down he was real
 nice about it and said were ways of earning a meal or two they he wanted to seal the door
 i was fortunate he assured me there was no work to be had in did not seal it while i
 was inside bidding him vancouver good bye i walked into the city where street cars but from the very first
 i never gave up lookwere banging around and horses and drays were ing one day i entered an employment office
 and rattling up and down the streets they took a dollar from me saying they would my first concern was
 breakfast proceeding have a place for me in a few days the next day along water street a chinese restaurant
 i entered another they said they could take a presented itself i did not know until later that dollar but
 were sure they could not place me in water street was a very old section and practi a month cally
 skid row the restaurant was entirely after making a useless application at a lumber staffed by chinese and did not
 impress me very yard one day i was leaving as a cart load of split favourably i never returned ambling
 along wood came to a halt at the gate were you look water street i came to a place called
 carter ing for a job asked the driver follow me house a number of boarders sitting around and you can
 earn your dinner packing this in off appeared to be well behaved men the rates were the street it is
 not allowed to stay on the street five dollars a week for room and board it was and they would
 be glad to get it in be around no means up to date but i found it to be a
 quiet about two and i ll have another i got 35 cents comfortable place after signing the register i for
 hat load and two loads in the afternoon netted felt quite at home me another 50 cents another one the
 next morn later on the street when sizing up the town i ing brought 75 but not all the loads
 were was surprised to meet several men with buck dropped on the street and i was not the only one
 saws what was more sur prising was the fact that alert for a meal or two i recognized several we
 all shook hands and and then a week later a man approached me exchanged the latest news they had been
 here in the hotel and said he had a job for me this for some time and were running short
 of finances is a job of hook tending he said you know they had moved into the salvation army hostel
 what a hook tender is i had not the faintest on water street which they referred to as the idea
 but i told him i could find out you come dump here they were allowed to saw wood around to
 the office in the morning and we ll from 9 00 am until twelve for those three make out the
 papers you go to work next monhours they were given 45 cents with this they day morning could get a
 ten cent bed a 20 cent dinner and well that was that now to find out what a a 15
 cent supper at times in the afternoon there hook tender was this was a job where a con 17 tractor
 for the b c electric was having telephone an acrid smell a number of men were gathered poles pulled out
 of a swamp the horses used around the box heater and were drying out cigar had to follow a split
 called a puncheon road butts when dry they rubbed these into pipe or with the use of a cable and
 pulleys the hook cigarette tobacco as there were no familiar faces tender had to hook out the poles one at
 a time i did not linger long as i walked the higher and guide them out of the road i
 was to work streets a man whom i knew walked by he was for two dollars and a quarter a
 day a good hook well dressed and carried himself nicely he did tender was worth two or three times that
 much not notice me and i did not draw his attention i looked the contractor up saturday morning but as
 he strode along he suddenly swerved to and though not too pleased because i knew so one side and with
 a swift movement reached little of bunk work he signed me on and also down and picked up a full
 length ‘ snipe that s gave me a job for the afternoon unloading a scow what cigar butts were called
 he dropped it in load of barrels of lime his pocket in a single movement and i wondered the foreman
 was a big strong man tom why should a man of his quality be reduced to mccallum we went out
 monday morning to sniping look over the proposition we arranged a loading shortly after i met a man whom i
 d known on place i found a broken cant hook a hook for the salvation army wood cutting gang he
 was rolling logs and fashioned a good handle looking very pleased he told me of a brother i followed him
 around the swamp and decided who had sent him 40 and a ticket to seattle on how each pole would
 come out these great there was also a white collar job waiting for him long poles were already pulled but
 lying in all he was now making himself presentable well shapes and tangles among a ll the windblown and that
 was good news he gave me an address and dead tr ees told me to look him up and ther
 e would be good we knew we would have to load 25 poles a jobs for both of us day
 so we planned to make an extra bank to have thinking this over a day or two later i decided
 in case we didn t get out 25 satisfied that we to go to seattle and i would walk or
 work my had everything lined up right we went back to way around by blame maybe i would find town
 and the next morning we moved out with something that suited me along the way accordteams drivers and wagons ingly
 the next morning i took the street car to there was no trouble landing 25 poles the new westminster and
 started south along the first day the next day we had to load 25 poles railroad tracks it was a
 beautiful day the 17 th which took us all morning from then on it kept of march it was a
 wooded area on each side of us busy landing our quota of poles and then the tracks there was neither
 roads nor residences tom had to miss a day or two each week for some in sight though occasiona lly
 there was a sort of reason sometimes a man would come out to rabbit or foot path into the forest
 on one of these replace him but it sure kept me on the jump a man appeared and we got
 into conversation once he was gone for several days and sent he did not think much of my idea of
 going south out a man he was determined to pull out the the further you go the worse it gets
 he closer poles and even used up our bank when said men flock to the cities in the winter time
 tom came out and saw what he d done he let you think vancouver is bad but further south him
 go pronto four men stayed a few days and there are ten men for every job we got things going
 again then as the haul was we parted and pondering on what he said i getting too long for our
 team he sent out another must have almost reached white rock when sud tom and i did not get along
 together he kept denly i thought of being a cowboy at medicine ranting because the contractor had not sent out
 hat considering it for a minute the wide open a more experienced hook tender he was prairies and blue sky
 forced its appeal and with desperately upset if he had to wait a minute no further hesitation i hot footed

 workmen came away and out of sight these people made us in shortly after six on two hand cars about
 eight welcome fed us and put us up for the night men to a car they were a good natured
 lot and in the morning this rancher said he was going were a better than average bunch of men to
 a neighbour s who was going into the hat we somehow they had got a football and kicked that could
 ride with him and most likely ride with the around after supper they also had other games neighbour on in
 this proved correct neighbours and foot races the work apparently was not too lived about ten miles apart during the
 afternoon hard the steel rails on the track had been what we rode into the hat here we met a
 number from was called light steel and had been removed and the steel gang the morning after we had left
 replaced with heavy steel as i recall it now there a carload of japanese had arrived and all the were
 two groups one working east and the other whites were paid off a number came into the working west there
 was other work to do hat and then disappeared others intended to go besides lifting rails to calgary and had
 tried to catch a freight but one thing we had to be on the watch for was there was no
 opportunity they had discovered the passing trains on hot days in the slimmer a shack down by the river with
 a heater in it and ing heat the trains had a trick of stealing up on invited us to join
 them i produced a dime and us out of nowhere and when quite close they bought a loaf of bread
 would let out a terrific blast sending us scurry i don t recall how we made out that day but
 ing to get those handcars off the track we did no begging i had made up my mind to we
 were not getting any high pay it may have get to calgary but my travelling mate wanted to been 1
 75 a day with 1 00 a day for board go east it was not hard to part with him
 but i found it necessary to get a suit of underwear to prepare for that long ride to calgary one
 must from the store and was charged 3 00 for a 1 50 have food passing a restaurant that served
 a lot suit that made a big hole in a week s pay so of working men i walked in
 and asked the proon the first of may i drew my time the prietor for a meal saying if i
 was ever back that passenger would halt for a minute that night and way i would pay him i planned
 to catch the blind for calgary another sure he said i ll get you something lad wanted to come with
 me but he was too slow and he did he must have known i was hungry the tr ain got
 away without us and he insisted we for he brought a big plateful and he looked real walk the ten
 miles to suffield and pass the night pleased when i thanked him in the watertanks now to catch a ride
 after dark a passenger we passed a kind of a dreary night and the next came in when it had
 been serviced and was morning a freight came in there was a settler s ready to go i scouted along
 a lumber yard close car in the lot and we asked the man in charge to the tracks and remained
 out of sight then just if we might come in he said we could and told as it was preparing
 to leave a mounted us to hide in some hay but we had been spotted policeman came and stood between
 me and the and the conductor came to the door and told that blind my mind was made up if
 he stayed there man if he allowed us to stay on he would charge till the train moved i would
 rush past him and him for our fare to calgary we got off mount the blind but just as the
 bell was ringing there seemed no sense in sticking around here he crossed over to the other side and in
 a twinkl there was a road leading south and we reasoned ing i was on the blind this led to
 a ranch where we might sponge a meal on through the night we rode with never a but after following
 it for some distance it ended stop the night grew cold but i hung on the up at a haystack
 there is little hay in that part train stopped at brooks for water usually the of the countr y but
 in this low spot there was water tank is open with a stove in it but not some we rested
 for a time then followed the trail tonight it was locked again i boarded the blind for a few more
 miles and then the trail petered but this time it was colder the next stop was out completely and we
 were left on the bare for coal at bassano i ran up and down the tracks prairie without a landmark
 in sight it was now but couldn t get warm it was daylight now and on towards evening two watertanks
 were to be seen about four miles we saw a rider he was dumfounded to find away aboard the blind
 once more i jumped off two wanderers out there on the open prairie we and had a fire going in
 short order made up a stor y about how we came to be lost no freight came along during the
 afternoon 24 disaster almost befell the author when be begged for food near gleichen seen here in 1909 there were
 some boys snaring gophers nearby so and some food of f the table and while i i went over to
 look on and there was one of them washed up he prepared a meal from food left on i knew
 we spent most of the afternoon talking the table the mother had spoken as if i were and after they
 had supper he brought me out a a neighbour lunch we did not talk but he seemed quite interested the
 passenger was due shortly after dark and in the amount of food i stowed away thanking i was informed it
 might not stop at the tanks so him i passed outside and thanked the mother she i walked back to
 bassano it was coming in two nodded and then the elder sister turned on me sections so i caught the
 first one it stopped at with a stored up torrent of blasting such as i d the tanks for water
 but in taking the water it never had before i don t recall much of it but started spilling on
 me so i got off and even before it was about a no good bum begging his meals the water
 quit coming the train moved away i along the road while other men worked for a livwas not worried as
 i knew the next section was ing which they also had to do oh there was much coming but it
 went rattling through without a more but my burning ears refused to absorb it stop all before i was half
 way down the lane i had the next morning i stepped on the hand car resolved that i would starve
 to death rather than with the section gang and rode about ten miles beg another meal to join another gang
 coming to the dining car i went in but the chinaman there refused me of all the people with whom
 i came in confood only for work man he said but i tact these women stand out most vividly the
 grabbed some scraps anyway and got out mother patient and kind knowing what her gleichen came in sight shortly after
 noon it eldest daughter was preparing for me the was not ver y inviting but as there was a well
 daughter confining to the last minute the bitter built farmstead about a half mile north a hungry lashing she had
 in store and the younger stomach took me there a mother and two daughter warmly sympathetic i see them yet

 my plea for food the mother with the hot sun and prairie wind the mother s said oh surely and
