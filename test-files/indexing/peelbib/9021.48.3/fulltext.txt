 and bruce mackay for the first nine years of transcontinental airline service 1939 1948 lethbridge was western canada s principal
 airline hub the city was ideally situated to fulfill this function due to its location on the southerly route of
 the trans canada airway and the limited operational ceiling of the unpressurized lockeed aircraft then in use in the early
 years of civil aviation air travel was viewed as a mode of last resort rather than a competitor to existing
 systems of transportation canada s early commercial focus was primarily north south as bush planes provided access to resource extraction
 sites in the near north it was supposed that competition between aeroplanes and ground transportation might materialize at some future
 date but it was certainly not a serious consideration 2 in the late 1920 s the flow of air traffic
 began to shift to an east west orientation due to the advent of air mail rapidly developing passenger air service
 in the united states and calls to link the farflung components of the british empire with a system of airways
 lelhbrllio e trans canada airway air mail service was the first means of the provincial weld that so inspired our
 adapting aviation technology to the task fathers of confederation 4 but this was of nation building by 1931 air mail
 a daunting challenge for a country of links corresponded roughly with the only 11 million that required an airway system
 of highways and perversely the spanning 3 300 miles from moncton to gaps in canadian air service were vancouver roughly
 coincident with the cordillera and the canadian shield the same such a canadian airway was recognized gaps that challenged canada
 s land as the air bridge that would be based transcontinental route ways there required to articulate the british empire
 was no regular service across the in the modern age just as the cpr had rockies and american air services
 were functioned as a land bridge between used to detouring around the canadian the atlantic and pacific steamship lines shield
 country between windsor canada was a major link in the all red ontario and emerson manitoba air route from britain
 to the far east 5 in mail seemed more justifiable than 1935 canada newfoundland the irish passenger service which was
 viewed as free state and britain negotiated plans an unwelcome bedfellow according to to develop a trans atlantic mail and
 one commentator of the day mails may passenger service using flying boats be lost but must never be delayed and
 the north atlantic service anchored at passengers may be delayed but must its eastern end in canada and never be
 lost 3 at the onset of the newfoundland would benefit from a depression of the i 930 s the canadian
 government curtailed its air mail shorter great circle route than one services and then cancelled them operated directly to new
 york outright in 1932 not to be reinstated experimental trans atlantic flying boat services began in 1937 with imperial until
 1938 yet in establishing the canadian airways and the principles for airways later to become boac and a regular scheduled
 air service air mail eventually british airways and pan service became a vital precursor to american linking southhampton with scheduled
 air passenger service north america via foynes ireland botwood newfoundland shediac new during the 1930 s there was a growing
 brunswick occasionally longeuil just realization that canada would have to across the river from montreal and then take preemptive action
 to safeguard its on to new york 6 with a nascent transskies and prevent american airlines and atlantic air service
 calling at canada s air routes from tapping into canadian eastern portals and american giants traffic thus weakening canada s
 knocking at the door of every major city tenuous east west linkages aviation along its length and breadth the could
 function as the solder to renew canadian government chose to intervene alberta history summer 2000 much of 1938 was devoted
 to a daily ghost service to train air crew in the demands of night flying and ground crew in the
 routines needed to maintain regularly scheduled air service 9 the nascent airline established maintenance facilities in montreal and winnipeg to
 service its aircraft and built hangars in smaller centres in lethbridge tca built a brick and steel hangar in 1938
 a distinctive structure which still stands erected at a cost of some 150 000 the bricks were shipped in from
 the brickyards of medicine hat and cemented in place by local masons steel beams had to be rivetted together by
 outsiders as there were no high steel workers available in the city while tca made a considerable investment in its
 maintenance bases the young airline s ability to provide transcontinental service was dependent on rapid developments in aircraft technology in
 the late 1920 s high wing monoplanes began to be built with fuselages of welded steel tubing and wings of
 wooden spars covered in a metallic sheath these began to replace the wire braced wood and fabric directly in civil
 aviation to preempt the ed americans and cooperate with british ambitions for an all red route from london to the
 pacific rim on april 10 1937 trans canada air lines 7 tca was created as a crown a corporation with
 a mandate to provide transcontinental air passenger air mail and air freight service why was a crown 1 corporation created
 de novo when a private sector firm canadian airways precursor to canadian pacific airlines and later canadian airlines international was
 already in existence as canada s largest air carrier the ab decision has been variously attributed to ove a fit
 of absence of mind the mutual this hanger was built in distrust between james w richardson lethbridge by tca in
 1938 at the founder of canadian airways and cd new kenyon field airport the howe minister of the department of
 rotating electric beacon on the transport and by the unwillingness of roof of the hangar is now in the canadian
 airways to participate in the galt museum new airline without having much r ht influence in its management 8 trans
 canada air lines was created as a one of the twenty one dc 3 wholly owned subsidiary of canadian aircraft

 four months after its incorporation crew pushes the boarding stairs tca began carrying passengers on into position canadian airways former
 vancouver to seattle route but the primary goal of tca was transcontinental service and biplanes in use after world war
 one in the united states monoplanes such as the single engine fairchild 71 and the fokker universal and the three
 engine ford tn motor provided the earliest aircraft for mail and passenger service beginning in the 1930 s a revolution
 in aircraft design saw a new generation of all metal low wing monoplanes with retractable landing gear that established a
 new configuration for passenger aircraft the avant garde airliners of the l 930 s were built using monocoque construction and
 a prestressed aluminum alloy known as duralumin the shiny metallic skin became an integral part of the overall structure instead
 of just a shield for deflecting wind away from the frame sleek aluminum cowlings were fitted over the front of
 radial engines to reduce the drag created by their massive finned cylinders and added to their streamlined appearance twin engines
 alberta history summer 2000 were built into the leading edge of the advertised by tca as the world s fastest
 wing and equipped with variable pitch commercial transport an essential propellers to optimize take off power feature given the enormous
 distances to and cruising speed at a constant rate of be covered and the relatively small size rotation of the
 canadian cities to be linked in 1941 tca began acquiring a stretched the principal representatives of this new version of
 the lockheed 14 08 known as generation of airliners were the boeing the lockheed 18 or lodestar which 247 introduced
 in 1933 the douglas had a capacity of fourteen passengers dc 2 in 1934 the lockheed 10 a but similar
 operating characteristics during the 1930 s there was a electra in 1934 and the beech 18 in 1937 the flowing
 almost voluptuous a clear distinction was indicated in the growing realization that canada curves of these streamlined aircraft trans canada

 air travel in total the airway tca s first twin engine aircraft was the cost some 5 million to 6
 million a linkages lockheed 10 a similar to the plane that massive investment at that time 2 carried amelia earhart
 half way around the world and ultimately to her death as surveys for the trans canada airway the airline prepared
 for regular transcontinental service it acquired a stretched and longer range version of the lockheed 10 a known as the
 lockheed 14 h the super electra which had a maximum capacity of ten passengers ten of the new lockheed 14
 h s carrying ten passengers and three crew were required to inaugurate the transcontinental passenger service while official specifications rated
 it at a ceiling of 24 300 feet and a range of 2 060 miles in practice the lockheed super
 electras seldom flew at altitudes began in 1928 and construction was underway by the next year with their chain of
 radio beacons and airfields airways were conceived as linear routes much like railway tracks a scheduled aircraft service could not
 safely deviate from them added to these over 11 000 feet or for distances much in excess of 800 miles
 originally powered by a pair of pratt whitney hornet engines developing 875 horsepower the lockheed 14 h was plagued with
 cylinder head failures the tca fleet was re engined with 1 200 horsepower pratt whitney twin wasp engines and the
 aircraft were redesignated as the lockheed 14 08 while the lockheed 14 08 never enjoyed the popularity of the larger
 douglas dc 3 it was alberta history summer 2000 technologically driven safety concerns 150 feet of additional runway length was
 were the political imperatives of required for each 1 000 feet above sea nationalism an all canadian airway level thus
 for example the lethbridge system would help to keep canadian airport at an elevation of about 3 000 traffic at
 home and fend off the leviathan feet required runways of 3 450 feet in to the south 3 the trans
 canada airway fact its first two runways were 3 400 was built and maintained by the federal and 3 700
 feet long 5 department of transport it owned no planes operated no flights and sold no the preparation of airports
 was tickets yet it was a sine qua non of especially arduous in the canadian scheduled civil aviation in the
 early shield country of ontario where l 930 s clearing and stumping were the first ‘ phases of construction in
 the grasslands development of the airway accelerated of the prairie west grading and seeding in 1933 when it became part
 of a relief to grass were the most important project of the depression organized by requirements in creating runways and
 the government of prime minister rb taxiways major centres such as calgary bennett clearing stumping and already had a municipal
 airport and the grading remote airports was thought to airway required only that these have be an admirable task for
 the re hard surfaced runways and full lighting employment of single homeless men 4 in the case of montreal s

 more paved landing strips and to mark obstructions such as its route across canada they were surveyed in the form
 of a antennas and industrial chimneys triangle el cross or tee while the airports needed full field and runway remainder

 aircraft to use the first like divisional points on the generation of radio direction finding transcontinental railway which were rdf

 even though the had been cobbled together in 1923 to ground was not visible when the drone create canadian national
 railways it stopped the aircraft was in the cone of followed the canadian northern cnr silence directly above the radio
 range line from montreal to ottawa and on up so that pilots flying on instruments could the ottawa valley to
 north bay at determine their position with exactitude north bay the airway struck north along the temiskaming northern ontario between
 the major terminal airports railway to cochrane at cochrane the where regular traffic was expected and airway turned west and
 followed the refuelling was necessary secondary or route of the national transcontinental 1 alberta history summer 2000 closely the chain
 of airports that made up the airway demanded road or rail access to bring in the massive machinery to clear
 and grade the airports construction materials for runways and buildings and the heavy equipment required to actually operate the airports
 and supply fuel to aircraft in some regions the equipment and supplies could be shipped in by road but the
 great difficulty in building the trans canada airway was that it preceded completion of the trans canada highway by some
 thirty years there was no canadian highway link crossing northern ontario on the 800 mile route between cochrane and winnipeg
 in british columbia the columbia mountains had been broached in two places by the cpr but there was still no
 roadway through the monashee range between castlegar and penticton in the south and across the selkirks between revelstoke and golden
 thus the trans canada airway had to follow the railway route across the country because there was no other way
 that a series of airports like beads on string could be built sufficiently close together to support the scheduled and
 emergency needs of aircraft with an operating range of less than 800 miles the prairie section of the trans canada
 airway proved to be the easiest to build and by march 1930 a nightly mail service from winnipeg to calgary
 and north to edmonton was in operation when crossing the rocky mountains the decision was made to route the airway
 through lethbnidge and the crowsnest pass on its way to vancouver thus lethbnidge with a population of 13 500 became
 an important junction point while calgary with a population of 103 000 in 1931 was bypassed the standard explanation for
 this routing is that trans canada airlines elected to follow the crowsnest pass because the mountains were lower and the
 lockheed 14 aircraft then in use cruised most efficiently at 8 000 to 10 000 feet 2 a glance at
 any aeronautical chart shows railway cnr all the way through kapuskasing wagaming sioux lookout and on to winnipeg the national
 transcontinental railway line crossed easier country than either the canadian pacific or canadian northern rail lines through northern ontario the
 climate was colder but the variance in temperature was less the northernmost rail line also provided better access to the
 mining communities of northern ontario and quebec finally suitable sites for the intermediate aerodromes were difficult to find or unavailable
 along the rugged and rocky canadian shield that lined the two more southerly rail lines 9 in essence the route
 through northern ontario cut a chord across the southern lobe of the hudson bay lowland it required many fewer rock
 cuts and though heavily forested by black spruce its relief is quite low from winnipeg westward the airway followed the
 southernmost railway in canada the cpr main line through brandon regina and swift current to medicine hat from there it
 followed the cpr s crowsnest pass route to lethbridge cranbrook grand forks hope and on to vancouver why did the
 trans canada airway follow the geography of the railways so n v ‘ el above trans canada airlines was the
 first north american airline to enter the turboprop age in 1954 with the vichers viscount seen here as part of
 a tca advertisement the viscount was still in service when air canada discontinued lethbridge operations in 970 right a dc
 3 is refuelled in lethbridge about 1947 alberta history summer 2000 that this is indeed the case though the difference
 in elevations is not great the highest terrain elevation on the route from calgary to vancouver is 12 000 feet
 while the highest elevation along the lethbnidge to vancouver route is 10 900 feet the crowsnest pass route is only
 1 100 feet lower than the kicking horse pass route considering the cost and inconvenience of serving lethbridge with a
 feeder line joining calgary and edmonton the slight difference in elevation seems trivial as a motivating factor tca pilots were
 required to maintain a minimum altitude through the rockies of 11 000 feet to provide a 1 000 feet of
 clearance over the highest peaks 2 clearly other factors were at work which militated in favour of the southerly route
 according to j a wilson controller of civil aviation exhaustive surveys showed that the crow s nest route through southern
 british columbia was preferable in every respect it was shorter the climate was better it passed through a more settled
 area and the difficulties of constructing aerodromes were less there than on the alternative routes via the yellowhead and kicking
 horse passes aerodromes were already in existence on the route at fernie cranbrook trail grand forks and chilliwack which would
 decrease the cost of construction in addition to the data provided by these early surveys there was a powerful precedent
 set by the first flight across the rockies and the early air mail flights which had followed the crowsnest pass
 route due to its lower elevation thus the decision to route air traffic through lethbridge had nothing to do with
 trans canada air lines the operational ceiling of the lockheed electra aircraft or the 1 100 foot difference in the
 elevation of the rocky mountains between the kicking horse and crowsnest passes the decision that the airway should take the
 southern route through lethbridge and the crow s alberta history summer 2000 the decision to route air traffic through lethbridge
 was taken in 1931 six years before the incorporation of tca the trans canada airway was surveyed and planned in
 an earlier technological era in which the maximum ceiling of the large aircraft in use in canada was 14 150

 originated in montreal and went to north bay via ottawa where they met a connecting flight from toronto the passengers
 from both cities then proceeded across the continent on a single aircraft in exactly the same ways as the trains
 did for passengers going to or from the maritimes the tca schedule promoted a direct connection between montreal s st
 hubert airport and the canadian national railways ocean limited which stopped at the airport for connecting passengers 26 this was
 the only time that a canadian airport ever had a direct railway connection a feature which is commonplace at many
 european and japanese airports air service was gradually extended eastward first to moncton then to halifax service to st john
 s was finally inaugurated on may 1 1942 however this occurred during wartime and the eastern service was viewed as
 part of hemispheric defence so few seats were available for civilians during world war two canada s fledgling aircraft industry
 concentrated on the assembly of aircraft that had been designed flight tested and proven in britain or the united states
 thus it seemed natural that the post war requirement for a longer range and higher passenger load airliner be satisfied
 by manufacturing foreign aircraft under license boeing had been preoccupied with long range bombers while lockheed s constellation was not
 yet ready thus montreal based canadian vickers soon to become canadair turned to the douglas corporation that had produced so
 many of the legendary dc 3 s in the united states the north star was a canadian version of the
 douglas dc 4 with some added features of the dc 6 the dc 4 brought wartime innovations into the post
 war era it had four engines power assisted controls flush rivetting and a steerable nose wheel in a tricycle configuration
 to replace the tail dragging dc 3 the american version was equipped with four pratt whitney twin wasp engines developing
 1 450 horsepower and could stay airborne even if two engines were out of action to foster its place in
 the peacetime aviation industry the canadian government encouraged the production of this large four engine aircraft using equipment and parts
 from a war surplus douglas aircraft plant in illinois the north star was built at canadair s cartierville plant and
 was first flown in middle 1946 it was a unique made in canada blend of american and british aviation technology
 the airframe employed a slightly shortened dc 6 fuselage nose and landing gea r while the tail section wings and
 control surfaces were based on the dc 4 it was felt that the aircraft needed more power than the standard
 dc 4 to permit it to fly at altitudes of up to 25 000 feet to avoid the notorious weather
 of the north atlantic at the same time additional take off power was essential because some canadian runways were snow
 covered for a significant portion of the year in the british aircraft design tradition the north stars were equipped with
 liquid cooled in line rolls royce merlin engines instead of the air cooled radials above this northstar prototype arrived at
 lethbridge in 1947 likely on one of its first east west flights note the row of exhaust ports and the
 massive air intakes below the propeller which indicate in line liquid cooled rolls royce merlin engines alberta history summer 2000

 linen to be laundered and perhaps there is no other country on this mundane sphere but this where such a
 thing is done it is common here and affords a lucrative business in one of winnipeg s largest laundries linen
 is sent from edmonton battleford prince albert and other remote parts of the territories as well as from places a
 few hundred miles nearer the city here are a few bundles of clothes that i received today remarked a laundryman
 to a reporter yesterday this one is from a prominent government official at edmonton and this one comes from a
 mounted police officer stationed at a post somewhere north of battleford that large one there is from a rancher in
 alberta and the others belong to young farmers living in various parts of the north west yes they send all
 sorts of clothes to be washed but chiefly shirts collars handkerchiefs etc we frequently get cricket and lawn tennis suits
 to be done up also out in those far away places persons who are in the least fastidious about their
 linen cannot get it done up to suit them at home so they are compelled to send it to winnipeg
 to be manipulated professionally and artistically so to speak in a great many cases too they are bachelor farmers or
 ranchers and have no facilities for doing their washing at home oh yes we have a few lady customers in
 the far west also we have some linen in hand now that will probably do duty at the ball at
 banff this month and also at other vice regal events this is a great country and the people do great
 things sometimes but this matter of sending clothes nine hundred miles will strike most mortals as being a queer characteristic

 journey with as much apparent indifference as if a few days was to bring it to a conclusion simpson departed

 exposed me to frequent changes and separation from friends he wrote yet it has not been able to divest me
 from feeling very acutely such separation when the hour arrives he particularly regretted bidding farewell to his valuable friend the
 governor of ruperts land george simpsonl and he reflected was free from obstacles their course was unimpeded and they could
 occasionally sail on 20 july for example simpson recorded some of our boats being still in the rear we did
 not proceed on our journey untill 4 30 am that was a late start they were sometimes underway two hours
 earlier the following four hours were occupied in getting above the rapids of the mossy portage at noon while they
 were making another portage the day wasi extremely warm thermometer 8 1 they encamped at 8 p m and simpson

 did not commence the journey without feelings of satisfaction at the prospect it held out to me of seeing a
 variety of new and interesting scenes the weather was fine but they were very much persecuted by mosketos throughout the
 day after proceeding about eighteen miles they encamped at 9 20 p m the first stage of the journey required
 ascending the hayes river for about three hundred miles and then crossing to the echimamish and nelson rivers for the

 deer tribes elk bears both of the black and grizzle kind were also numerous it took fifty eight days for
 the brigade to travel from york factory to fort edmonton and after the labours of the journey the heat the
 mud and the mosketoes it was time for a party and the voyageurs and inhabitants of fort edmonton knew how
 to have fun on 12 september chief factor john rowand favoured us with a ball in the evening which appeared
 to diffuse a great deal of delight pleasure among the numerous partakers of the amusement simpson further observed poignant picture
 of the great herds of buffalo and other animals that once inhabited the north american prairies we were soon gratified
 by a sight of immense herds extending along the plains as far as you saw besides these there were also
 large herds of deer here there you saw flocks of wolves prowling about for prey you also see the eagle
 soaring over the plains ready to pounce upon his prey the hunt was successful and after a good feed they
 took up their abode for the night under the shelter of a few willows which to a stranger appears rather
 an uncomfortable nights residence the brigade passed the mouth of the battle river near the modern town of battleford on
 27 august the weather was becoming cooler which simpson noted with relief has had the happy effect of driving away
 the mosketoes one of the greatest pests the traveller has to contend with thirteen days later on 9 september they
 arrived at fort edmonton the most important trading post on the saskatchawan it was surrounded by a palisade and in
 a good state of defence against indian attack a very necessary precaution near the fort was a considerable extent of
 farm with an abundant crop of wheat barley oats potatoes and a garden producing excellent vegetables the banks of the
 river provided ample pasture land for the horses the surrounding country all appeared anxious to decorate themselves in their best
 attire and altho among so many there were some grotesque figures yet the general appearance of the group was very
 pleasing and i was not a little amazed to see scotch reels and even country dances danced with a spirit
 grace that would not disgrace a far more refined society among the half breeds and canadians particularly i observed some
 excellent dancers the half breed girls tho evidently not so proficient in that art made a very good appearance seemed
 most pleased with the entertainment it was probably the wee hours of the morning before the fiddles were put away
 and the last merrymaker made his way to bed for a few hours sleep before beginning the next and most
 arduous leg of the voyage across the continent of north america they now had to portage from the north saskatchewan
 river in the hudson bay drainage basin to the athabasca river 75 miles to the northwest the provisions and goods
 were prepared into packs loaded onto horses and at 2 p m on 13 september the colombian brigade commenced the
 journey across the portage those destined for the athabasca and upper slave lake departed a few hours later the whole
 brigade consisted of about fifty men and eighty three horses with the country now presents a face of rich meadow
 land with occasional groves of wood interspersed over its surface giving to the scene a richness beauty which even rivals
 lawns rich pasture lands of a civilized country alberta history summer 2000 thirty three of the men destined for the

 simpson with the columbia and remained at the fort for the night and new caledonia brigade ascended the caught up
 with the brigade the following river to the westward a week after their morning arrival they left at 9 n
 m on 25 september travelling by horseback on the first day simpson pursued what was thought to the cumbersome york
 boats were not be the correct course but after arriving used on the athabasca river instead at a deep swamp
 stream he began aemilius and the others embarked in to suspect he had followed the wrong three very deeply laden
 canoes each road while retracing his steps he said carrying seven men and a cargo the i had a rather
 unwished for meeting canadian crews aemilius observed with a bear but on taking a short survey appear very well pleased
 with the of me he turned into the woods then change as they are much more used to after a
 very coarse night rain sleet and understand the management of with thunder lightning they birch canoes much better than the
 boats to the passengers however the resumed their march over a route that simpson considered to be almost change i
 think affords no advantage the impassible to man or beast the heavy lading reducing our room to very small bounds
 horses their loads frequently falling into swamps ruts in which they almost the unpleasant weather and trials of the disappeared
 it required extraordinary efforts at times to extricate the poor portage behind them they progressed animals from their very uncomfortable
 rapidly towards the rocky mountains and despite delays caused by damage to situation the canoes in the rapids they averaged
 a about 25 miles each day often poling it rained throughout the following night and tracking on most days simpson
 cleared up at 6 n m and two hours later noted that the weather was fine and they resumed their
 labours over a clear sometimes with a frost and thick continuance of extremely bad roads fog in the mornings the
 autumn colours leading thru woods quagmires were making their first appea rance and marshes at the end of the day
 the day after leaving fort assiniboine aemilius estimated they had gone simpson commented about 18 miles over the worst road
 i certainly ever saw travelled in any the general appearance of the banks other part of the world i really
 believe has been very interesting in some the route would be considered places rising in perpendicular cliffs of impassible yet
 so familiar is the from two to three hundred feet their voyageur with difficultys that he is summits richly cloathed
 in pines better qualified to overcome them than birches poplars the various tints any other people i have met with
 of their foliage forming a very pretty contrast which combined with the they arrived at fort assiniboine on the singular
 appearance assumed by many north bank of the athabasca river on 18 of the hanging cliffs forms a very september
 the weather was coarse agreeable landscape with rain and sleet which prevented preparing the canoes for the ascent of the
 pleasant weather continued and on the river the last men to cross the 5 october eleven days after leaving fort
 portage did not arrive until the 24 th assiniboine they came in sight of the goods were wet and had
 to be dried rocky mountains in the sw their lofty before packing at this place the brigade summits towering up

 c arlton in 1826 it was a major trading post serving the plains indians by the time this photo was
 taken in 1884 it had become dilapidated and was burned down a year later alberta history summer 2000 the following
 day was occupied simpson wrote in making arangements for our journey across the portage the separation of the brigades for
 the colombia new caledonia the latter pursue a route that has hitherto been passed by few report says it is
 a good one which soon leads them to head waters of fraser s river after wishing their friends farewell those
 heading for the columbia mounted the athabasca river a few miles further the columbia brigade now consisted of six gentlemen
 with twenty four men boys having nineteen horses to convey the luggage and passengers they left the valley of the
 athabasca on 11 october and made their way towards the southwest ascending the valley of today s whirlpool river for
 a distance of about 30 miles their destination was the athabasca pass which crosses the continental divide at an elevation
 of 5 700 feet the route had long been known to aboriginal travellers and a few independent traders and shortly
 after david thompson epic crossing in january 1811 it became the main transmontane fur trade route they ascended over pretty
 steep eminences simpson recorded pass thru thick woods intersected by swamps into which the poor horses sink with their loads
 later one of the animals was so much injured that it was deemed necessary to kill him an expedient that
 was not at all disagreeable to our voyageurs his flesh being deemed by them as good and seasonable supply of
 food they arrived at the summit on 13 october and simpson saw a reminder of his native land i observed
 the heather he noted such as i have seen on the hills of scotland although i had frequently heard that
 this continent does not produce that plant they immediately began their descent of the western slope of the rocky mountains
 a precipice of enormous to where the yellowhead highway would eventually be built and the view of the approaching cordillera
 thrilled simpson at noon the next day he wrote our canoe got broke by striking a hidden rock obliging us
 to put on shore immediately to repair we again pursued our journey and arrived at jaspers house at 3 pm
 this place was an important way station and a source of supply of horses necessary for the transmontane portion of
 the journey after an overnight stay they left at 12 30 in the afternoon simpson with part of the brigade
 continued on the athabasca river others travelled with the horses that night they camped near the location of present day
 jasper where simpson noted our encampment might vie in point of romantic appearance with many of far greater celebrity on
 our left is the perpendicular face of this stupendous rock rising to an elevation of upwards of three thousand feet
 its shadow casting a gloom over the deep defile so opposite to the brilliant sky immediately over us that the
 mind feels an impression as if this situation was somewhat supernatural on the 8 th they were at the eastern
 approach to the yellowhead pass and above this photograph by charles horetzky is entitled edmonton from opposite side october 24

 communication after a five mile trek to the bottom he looked back upon the immense mountain range that he had
 just descended and reflected that you cannot avoid feeling some degree of amazement at the feat you have performed and
 the idea forces itself upon the mind that this is by no means an agreeable barrier between seperated friends it
 was he added the most difficult extraordinary road i certainly ever travelled after another two days of overland travel they
 arrived at the columbia river and on 16 october the brigade consisting of about 33 hands embarked in three boats
 constructed in imitation of canoes 4 the most laborious parts of the journey were now behind them but the river
 was fast and treacherous on the day after their departure simpson recorded we run the upper dalles rapids a very
 grand shoot the runing of which is attended with considerable danger and requires great skill on the part of the
 steersman bowsman they passed through the upper arrow lake on 18 october the salmon were spawning and he remarked that
 they were the most miserable looking fish he ever beheld being in the last stage of existence some local indians
 were spearing them but they must prove but an indifferent article of food but it is what these poor people
 principally depend upon for their subsistence on 20 october they crossed the 49 th parallel of latitude and at day
 s end they arrived at fort colville near kettle falls in the present state of washington they were received here
 by a number of indians to a stranger they appear grotesque figures their faces painted a variety of colours their
 leather robes fancifully decorated according to their fashion giving them a very fantastic air they remained there the following day
 completed the portage around kettle falls on the morning of the 22 nd and continued their journey they made a
 speedy descent of the columbia river rapids were frequent but there were few portages on many days the brigade travelled
 more than 70 miles the varied and picturesque scenery formed by the immense beds of basalt adjacent to the river

 strewed over its surface in detached masses resembling the druidical pillars of stonehenge on 1 november they arrived at the
 cascades which is the last obstruction in the columbia river and at 1 40 p m the next day they
 arrived at fort vancouver their place of destination simpson summarized the trek in the last words of his journal having
 made the journey from york factory in three months and nineteen days a distance which i estimate by our route
 of two thousand and eight hundred and seventeen miles the whole of which is by water communication except the assinaboine
 rocky mountain portages which does not exceed two hundred miles but still form the most serious obstacles on the line

 alberta history summer 2000 first shipment of lumber in 1829 travelling to california and the hawaiian islands he was promoted
 to the position of superintendent of shipping and in 1830 chose the site for a trading post a few miles
 up the nass river where he assisted in establishing fort nass in 183 l about the middle of august while
 on a trading expedition to the queen charlotte islands simpson became ill with a liver complaint and returned to fort
 nass where he died on 2 september aged thirty nine years his remains were laid to rest outside the stockade
 and soon afterwards that establishment was renamed fort simpson in his honour he was unmarried and his will dated at
 fort vancouver 14 november 1828 names his natural son horatio nelson simpson now residing in dingwall rosshire north briton as
 his sole beneficiary 8 route our journey tho not performed with great expedition may be justly called good as during
 the whole of it not the smallest accident occured to any of our party and every thing destined for the
 different posts arrived in perfect safety some correspondence and reports written after his death suggest that he gained the respect
 of some of his colleagues but he was not personally popular with others chief trader archibald mcdonald in a letter
 to his colleague john mcleod dated 15 january 1832 commented on the numerous deaths both accidental and natural of the
 company s personnel he wrote among the latter we have to lament the loss of poor lieutenant simpson who died
 on board his own vessel of a liver complaint after a few days illness independent of his loss to the
 concern i regret him very much as a private friend i am sorry to say with you in confidence however
 that he was not over popular with us the cause you know as well as i do 9 duncan finlayson
 also writing to mcleod said he departed this life much lamented and regretted and whatever feelings might be entertained toward
 him during his career in the past of the country there is now but one of general sympathy for his
 untimely end the journey had taken one hundred and twelve days and a new phase of simpson s adventures began
 the cadboro a schooner of 72 tons which aemilius was to command arrived from england via cape horn in 1827
 in june simpson sailed her from fort vancouver and transported supplies equipment and four officers twelve french canadians one french
 canadian half breed two kanakas 9 two iroquois an orkneyman and an irishman about thirty miles up the river to
 build fort langley 6 while the buildings and stockade were being built he sounded the river and made the first
 hydrographic chart of the lower fraser river he returned to fort vancouver and in the autumn he was sent by
 the dr john mcloughlin who was in charge of the columbia department to california to get provisions and to investigate
 the possibilities of establishing a trade in salmon and lumber he sailed with the above on november 1 1826 simpson
 and the brigade arrived at fort vancouve near the mouth of the columbia river it is seen here in 1858

 simpson ‘ sfirst actions on the west coast was to take the ship cadboro up the fraser river to build
 fort lan gle this is part of a survey map he prepared showing the jbrt at middle right alberta history
 summer 2000 both mcdonald and finlayson are vague regarding the cause of aemilius s unpopularity but it seems he carried
 the rigid sense of protocol and discipline of the royal navy to the fur fields of the british north america
 hubert bancroft an early chronicler of the history of the north west coast said about him for a british tar
 and a brave man on duty dealing rum molasses beads and blankets to savages for wild beasts skins simpson was
 excessively the gentleman though an efficient officer he was somewhat eccentric for example his hands must be incased in kid
 before he could give an order on his own deck in the daylight and if the occasion was perilous or
 peculiar his gloves must be white kid form was nine tenths of the law with him and the other tenth
 conformity his kinsman and patron george simpson noted in his character book that aemilus was about 40 years of age
 a namesake and relation of my own whom i should not have introduced into the fur trade had i not
 known him to be a man of high character and respectable abilities he has occupied the most dangerous post in
 the service since he came to the country and his whole public and private conduct and character have been unexceptional
 accounts of his death have reached me since writing this 2 he later wrote that aemilus was as good a
 little fellow as ever breathed honourable above board and to the point he may be a disciplinarian but it was
 very necessary among the vagabonds he had to deal with the drunken wretched creature sinclair 3 could afford him no
 support he was therefore under the necessity of doing all the dirty work of cuffing thunking himself i have laying
 all other claims feelings aside a very great respect for his character high opinion of his worth 4 in 1834
