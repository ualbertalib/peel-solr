 for statements of fact or opinion made 2 00 a year by authors a letter from fort edmonton on january
 lst 1840 john rowand chief factor at fort edmonton penned a new year s letter to governor george simpson and
 to the chief factors and chief traders in the northern department of the hudson s bay co in it he
 gives news and gossip from his district freely attacks his superiors and is candid about his problems in trading with
 the blackfoot rowand was one of the colorful figures of the fur trade 1 he joined the north west company
 in 1803 as a boy of fourteen and served at a number of posts on the north saskatchewan when the
 h b co and n w co amalgamated in 1821 he was taken on as chief trader at rocky mountain
 house two years later he was appointed chief factor of fort edmonton where he remained until his death in 1854
 as was the custom during that period men of the fur trade would make several copies of a circular letter
 and distribute them to their fellow traders this helped to spread the news and to provide a little variety in
 a sometimes isolated existence one of these letters of 1840 survived and in the 1920 s was owned by g
 c mctavish of winnipeg he provided a typed copy of it to d c coleman of montreal in 1924 where
 it found its way possibly as a bookmark into one of his books when the coleman library came to the
 glenbow foundation calgary the newsy information given by rowand over a hundred years ago had returned to the area where
 it had originated from the literary standpoint it has been necessary to make a number of minor revisions normal punctuation
 has been added and an attempt made to limit the length of some sentences for example the opening sentence was
 208 words long broken by three comas any words added to the original text are in square brackets in the
 majority of cases replacing the word who because of the historical importance of this letter changes have been kept to
 a minimum with particular care being taken to see that the meaning was in no way altered hugh a dempsey

 presents the indians receive during our absence last summer a from the americans twice a year i good many of
 the slave tribes made have not forgot the time when it was their appearance with a little to trade not
 near so difficult to settle with all had it not been for a rascally cree in those indians with plenty
 tobacco dian who killed a piegan chief at some ammunition and rum and very little distance from here a great
 many more dry goods it was all that was required was to have come on a trade but were to
 pay for what they have to give now prevented by the unexpected act of that indian at a time when
 they thought but those good old times have altered all was peace as it was told to them here with
 us as well as with our friends in the columbia and red river where on my arrival here from the
 red they require ships load of goods now river i had the satisfaction to find every the peigans who are
 the worst of all thing connected with this place in capi the slave tribes to please expect a great tal
 order and what pleased me not a many things for nothing they are all little was to find the rascally
 indian who had killed the piegan chief well secured in irons hand and feet i felt a little at alexander

 dressed as such gratis of course if not off they go back to the americans where they say they are
 sure of being well received for their few furs buffalo flobes wclves and their horses these form one of their
 principle articles of trade with the americans and us too to enable us to keep up the number of horses
 so much required for the company s work and for sales to our men and indians c besides we lose
 a great many every year by sickness stone indians and wolves who have killed upwards of one hundred fifty since
 last spring those ravenous beasts are very numerous all about this place and where we keep our horses and the
 snow is very deep and hard so it is not all over with them yet so you see to feed
 the wolves we require goods also for all what we get from the slave tribes they expect the best articles
 in our shops as from the americans and chief factor iohn rowand was in charge as cheap they sell them
 goods red of fort edmonton for most of the period 1823 54 blue green and white blankets from 3 to
 4 pts at the rate of four robes each when they have the wherewith to pay and guns six and
 everything else in for their wants and cannot get it i the same proportion for a horse they think it
 would require all the logic one give a complete chief s clothing with has to give to please a fine
 large band one big keg of rum now for us to carry of piegans i am sure it would be
 of on as those people do to enable us to some good as it would learn what it is keep
 those indians we require double to deal with indians not with pitiful the quantity of some things such as mas
 kagoes or even crees for it is a blankets capots guns spirits and a pleasure and even childs play to
 settle few other articles more than we ever with them for several years i have got yet upon outfit which
 will not be been asking and begging i may say granted i know i have no recollection for a few
 articles of trade very much in of ever asking for more upon requisition demand by those indians which was than
 was thought absolutely necessary promised but is all to come yet so i for the trade of this district c
 often thought it better to leave off begging for less this did not prevent the gentlemen in charge of york
 depot cur we have plenty of opportunity to tailing our demands as this year for see indians with all their
 families who instance which i am a little afraid will come from the americans all dressed up not be felt
 by none more so than by better than i ever saw indians this way c t harriottt at rocky mountain

 beginning of october by nu 1809 as clerk serving most of his term in the merous bands of brutes of

 they have to cover themselves their camps to bring them this way to be ornamented with it and everything about
 killed they are not far from being them to having shoes upon their feet correct for no less than thirty
 eight the same way they bring bags of tents of fall indians 9 and black feet it also that they
 offer for sale to the after turning their backs to the amerwomen and children of our establishment icans last summer
 were surprised and all who tell us they get all that for nothing cut down to pieces by a party
 composed we see something better than beads with of indians from beaver creek fort pelly them also fine double barrel
 guns and from all quarters in that bloody and telescopes business only six crees and two soteaux remained upon the
 place of blood i might say if goods was scarce at shed the others after taking the scalps york and
 nothing to be done in the way of more than one hundred men women of returns in this district it
 would not and children got off with upwards of be half so unpleasant but to see stores two hundred horses
 and everything else full of goods and almost every other they found worth carrying with them little post in the
 north well supplied not very long ago another small camp with every thing necessary for the trade of cercees was
 attacked by some plain and us here who have a strong opposi crees and stone indians who killed a lion
 to contend with c and so much few of them also and took their horses more trouble to please the
 animals al for all these misfortunes we are the ready described to be without the arti ones who get blamed
 for it for inviting des of trade most in demand it is almost them back to us too much to

 for himstatement but it is all true and in my self with respect to that district humble opinion quite enough
 to show hcw pleasant it is to b e a slave indian mr clouston with his steersman trader and without
 the means to secure and four of the young hands from orkthe trade of a good many things we ney
 arrived here on the 4 th of november have enough but let the lynx and too late of course to
 be of any assistance mrats be as numerous as the first was here in equipping the indians c in last
 winter and our strong wood indians the fall it is all very well as other exert themselves as well as
 last year we places is of much more consequence than shall be short enough of everything if the this as
 long as i am here the high slave tribes take in their heads to work water last summer in the
 south branch also and there is plenty of robes for us river which is called bow river with the plain
 indians say it is not worth war parties prevented some of our halfwhile hunting mrats at twelve for a breeds
 from making a beaver hunt who skin only killed about one hundred some black feet rascals killed a couple of
 americans again last summer near fort another thing i have to state i know we have had very good of
 no district where a cooper can be of crops this fall of barley potatoes and more use to the company
 than here and plenty of turnips at almost every post in at the rocky mountain house the slave the district
 but as we are not all far tribes who get as much liquor as they mers we shall say no
 more about this like from the americans and who are becoming most determined drunkard it is too early to speak
 correctly about dogs as ever was of late feel not a little what we have to expect in the way
 of displeased with us because they cannot returns there is so many unforeseen get liquor to take away with them
 as difficulties to contend with it is not easy with the americans all for the want of to conjecture how
 matters will turn out small kegs as ridiculous as this may in these difficult times i can only say appear
 to some one it is of more con with truth that we refuse nothing in the sequence to us here
 than they may sup shape of furs as for beaver it is i am pose kegs would prevent quarrels and
 sorry to say getting preciously scarce save goods in scarce times you may indeed how can it be otherwise this
 all think as you like but the americans poor old worn out district encroached give more liquor to the indians
 than on from all sides not only by our amerwe ever did here we have proof enough icon opponents but
 also by indians and to make me say so half breeds from other districts spots left to recruit by us
 is swept away by strangers so far there is no appearance of the buffalo in this neighbourhood but thank i
 had almost forgot to let you know god we have very good fish and our something about the two red
 river de fort hunters give us a few moose and serters doctor mcloughlin got frcm the red deer now and
 then we have more snow on the ground about this place than we had for several years before a little

 to peace river ogilvie s report on the feasibility of a cart road from edmonton to peace river laid before
 the north west council lately gives three routes one from edmonton via lac la nonne and old fort assiniboine one
 by lake st ann and the mcleod river and one by way of the present athabasca landing road then along
 the athabasca lesser slave river and lesser slave lake the difficulty on the first route lies between the pembina river
 and slave lake post about 160 miles and would cost about 10 400 from edmonton to the pembina would cost
 about 10 000 and from slave lake to peace river about 2 000 the second route by way of lake
 st ann and the mclecd river he knows nothing of personally but believes it to be similar to the first
 mentioned one the third route is from edmonton 86 miles to the landing then acrcss and up the athabasca up
 slave river and along slave lake on its north side and on to peace river by the present road from
 the landing to slave lake part of this route would cost about 11000 with 2 000 on each of the
 cart trails now in use from edmonton to the landing and from slave lake to peace river he considers this
 although the longest the best route of the three and that its development would cut edmonton out of the northern
 market how he arrives at this sage conclusion does not appear edmonton bulletin nov 19 1887 6 a cycle at

 accompanied by a well known gentleman interested in the grain business as guide drove into the country with the intention
 of insuring a few farmers on the way home a pack of some six or seven coyotes were descried first
 by the sabbath breakers horse and afterwards by the sinners themselves as shout after shout left the latter with the
 intention of frightening the coyotes away but without avail they decided to drive in the direction of the fearless and
 blood thirsty beasts the coyotes kept their ground until with great difficulty owing to the timid state of the horse
 a space of some 15 or 20 yards was left between the pursuers and the pursued the horse becoming more
 and more alarmed it was agreed that the guide should alight and with stones drive the beasts away upon lighting
 the coyotes started to move which still more frightened the faithful steed of the sabbath breakers to such an extent
 that it was impossible for the driver to control him then ensued a scene that would turn most men s
 blood cold but which had no effect on the insurance agent the buckboard was seen flying across the prairie at
 a break neck pace the guide following at a distance which increased step by step while the coyotes who had
 now become the pursuers were rapidly gaining ground and the guilty parties were beginning to say their prayers when three
 gallant horsemen appeared cn the gallop coming towards the pursued seeing the danger the coyotes halted much to the relief
 of the insurance man and guide and it transpired to the horsemen also who halted and faced about the party
 arrived in town shortly after and vow that in future they will attend sunday school and leave the coyotes for
 the huntsmen who appear more successful at the business than insurance agents the grain man had a narrow escape but
 the other fellow was in no danger as it would take a pretty powerful coyote to make any impression on

 also was used as a boarding house police barracks and jail and as a hospital the children recall having had
 prisoners in the house shackled to the furniture to mrs rendell was born the first baby in lloydminster her daughter

 a hospital at lloydminster realizing the need she first opened her house in the service of the community for this
 purpose she was also instrumental in the organizing of the first public hospital at lloydm in ste r a gifted
 pianist mrs rendell was the first music teacher in lloydminster she helped to promote in the early days the lloydminster

 but my little ones do not leave me much well we never got away from st free time jchns until
 long past midnight on thursday owing to the dilatory way in which saskatoon the luggage was discharged from the april
 22 nd 1903 lake simmtcee it was simply scandalous my dear friends my husband could not find a single piece
 my letter this time will contain just of all our baggage and they telephoned a few startling incidents of emigrant

 to carelessness o clock meal and by this time the poor after weary waiting my poor husband s children were
 famished all tired out with patience was at last rewarded and our waiting to land and they would not lost

 see my husband and a disgrace to civilization and in this our travelling companion and friend mr misery we were
 boxed up to spend just young come in with smiling faces and on a week i do think for the

 a pair to be proud of being starved with the cold our two we now have horses wagon and harness
 little ones have proved themselves brave complete the wagon has a large covered little souls facing already hunger and hood
 so will act as a house for a while privations too numerous to mention the next bit of good news

 chill at st johns from exposure mr barr has arranged that mr young s and a dreadful abscess formed in
 my homestead is within a mile of us i need face causing me terrible suffering for not say how mutually
 pleased we are three days until it broke but enough at the prospect of being near neighbours of the gloomy
 side i cannot give much mr young is in every respect such a description of the country we passed thru
 as pain almost b linded me but skirting some of the great lakes there by may 1 st 1903 when
 this photo was taken were some grand bits of scenery but not most barr colonists were ready to leave saskatoon

 was blowing a hurricane bringing or my dear friends rather driving the fire straight on us the awful roar of
 the flames was enough whenever anything of importance to make the bravest shudder and the happens i always feel it
 is about time smoke and smell stifling willie canto write a general letter yesterday tinued ploughing until absolutely cornwas a
 day never to be forgotten by any pelled to stop owing to heat and smoke of the inmates of doris
 court or inhabit our two men meanwhile drenched our ants of lloydminster for days past we roof with water and
 arming themselves have been anxiously watching seven with wet sacks hurried to the weakest huge prairie fires raging in the
 distance points where there was the least profearing that a wind might bring heavy bability of the flames jumping the
 fire disaster to our homestead and town the guard which was only 150 yards off the night of october 20
 th was an anxious house all round we could do nothing one the terrible circle of fire closing more than
 wait with bated breath at around us the general opinion was last came the joyful sound safe from that we
 were safe for the night b ut i the western side but the danger was not could not sleep the
 next morning our yet over for on the north and west side worst fears were realized and we knew we
 were again threatened and after a few hours would decide our fate the the horses had been placed in safety
 all only safeguard against prairie fires is hands had to fly around to meet the a broad belt of ploughing
 all round your enemy at the fresh point of attack and homestead this my husband had done after a hard
 fight thanks to cool heads with the exception of one side which alas and strong arms the dreaded fire was
 was the very side towards which the kept at bay and after a short time of fire was sweeping with
 awful rapidity awful suspense and anxiety my husband needless to say the plough was soon came back to us with
 the welcome asat work and it was literally ploughing surance all danger over safe for anfor dear life every available
 tub was other year we were all too overjoyed filled with water every sack collected for words and after the
 dreadful strain together to beat out the flames when of so many hours you may pretty well the time should
 come mr rendell guess what the reaction was like mr barnes and another man who is working rendell was literally
 fagged out but for us were all on the alert watching after a little rest and refreshment we with intense
 eagerness all the different all felt better we lost four ton of hay points meanwhile within the house i only
 but many have lost all their hay together with mrs falmank the wife of ricks the fire started by the
 vermilion our postmaster who is boarding with us river and was raging for days before it for the winter and
 mrs bunyan who reached us and swept on down towards 21 battleford there is no doubt what launching into my
 yarn let me wish ever but that our fire guard in a great one and all every happiness and prosmeasure

 last in messrs hall scott and co s the memory of all the home gatherings spacious building you will see
 that in the old country fortunately we our christmas and new year was by no personally are far too busy

 any such a very large building for general ideas we are quite happy and con stores the gathering of the
 colonists tented very much better off than we took place there and it is certainly owing were in england whilst
 as to food we to their great kindness that our christ live quite as well as ever we did we
 mas and new year was spent so pleas have two butchers on the town site antly and happily the first
 item on our meat is delivered at the door and the programme was a big feed followed is of the
 very best quality certainly by a capital concert divided into two we have had difficulties to surmount and parts after
 the first half had been suc hardships to endure but we quite excessfully carried through came a large pected we
 should before we left england christmas tree very prettily decorated and we treasured up a reserve fund of the little
 gifts b eing distributed by an determination and pluck which stood us ideal santa claus i need scarcely in good
 stead when the need came i say how delighted the little ones were would never advise anyone to come out
 the whole proceedings were brought to here who is the least afraid of work a close about 11 30 p
 m after a most they are b etter off at home there is enjoyable social gathering and the first plenty
 of room to breathe in this country christmas in lloydminster is a thing of and if the work is hard
 the freedom the past but nevertheless it will be re which is the indispensable attribute of membered by all who
 were present as the life here makes one far less susa bright and happy one the more so ceptible to
 physical fatigue than in engas it was unexpected and so well carried land where one seems to have such a
 out the effect it had upon us was that feeling of weighty oppression to handiwe all felt cheered by this
 little excite cap one s energies here one feels that ment after all we had previously passed each week s
 work is a step onward through and somehow longed for more whilst also in the old country oftentimes 24 as
 a community project the barr colonists erected a log church it is seen here in about 1906 shortly after it
 was finished a year s hard toil brought nothing but prairie like mushrooms ready for them disappointment and additional anxiety
 without any special effort or exertion on their part i need scarcely say that we are the proud possessors of
 the they are now sadder and wiser men best house in the colony and i think i may also add
 the best homestead it so far we have passed through the is generally pronounced by those whose winter splendidly and
 at the time of opinion is worth having to be of excep writing this it is 19 th january briltionally
 good value owing to its close liant sunshine from week s end to week s proximity to the town our
 land is actual end our bungalow has kept beautily adjoining the town site there is fully warm it is heated
 throughout by no doubt whatever but that lloydmin pipes connected with the kitchen stove ster bids fair to be a
 very important and a heating stove in the hall the centre its growth week by week is rooms are all
 pretty well an even ternmarvelous the government are now perature the worst feature we have erecting a large emigration hall
 in had to contend with is want of water anticipation of the arrival of the new we have had two
 wells sunk close to corners in the spring meetings are the house but up to now have not been being
 held now to discuss and perfect successful in striking water of course all arrangements for the meeting of ex we
 are never without water whilst the pected friends and families and ensure snow is about we use nothing else but
 their safe conduct right up to the colony melted snow for washing and cooking there seems to be a terrible
 feeling lovely water it is too of jealousy or something akin to it existing at saskatoon and battleford from what
 i hear i fancy we are with regard to this colony and they are being favoured with an exceptionally doing
 their utmost to dissuade people mild winter to make up for the excepfrom coming up beyond those two points tionally
 severe spring that greeted us by spreading the most gloomy reports on our arrival in this country anyway whch are
 utterly untrue we have all kept well up to now we have had a good supply of wood from many
 there are who seemed to ex our own land and the price of coals pect that luxuries sprang up on
 the is another item over which we have no 25 need to worry we have to pay very dear friends
 dearly for flour four and a half dollars for a hundred pounds the reason it has come to my ears
 that some things are so dear is of course owing to of you are still athirst for more about the
 freightage when the railway canada so i am going to try to send comes through the colony everything you a
 short account of how we are prowill be cheaper there is every pros gressing in this far away land well
 pect of the rail b eing opened up in a the town of lloydminster is growing not year from now
 the telegraph will be slowly and surely but rapidly and in working order in a few weeks time surely just
 recently we have a fine we have two large general stores drug bank building belonging to the canadian bank of
 commerce stores a resident doctor and hospital in view we have choral union mustering 120 members and they are now
 forming lloydminster a rifle corps 160 members enrolled nov 1905 mr rendell has been appointed lieuten dear friends ant and
 auditor it is such a long time since i last wrote you a general letter that i think the temperature
 at time of writing i must make an effort to give you some registered 28 below zero those who idea
 of how we are getting on up to have been outside say it is a bit nippy date much has
 happened since i wrote and if you don t take proper precautions last and i hardly know where to begin
 to well protect nose and ears you soon lloydminster is now quite a little town get them frost bitten the
 only remedy the rail is up and our station is quite there is to well rub the part affected a
 pretty addition to the town little with snow till circulation is restored did i think that the whistle of an
 engine the land here is of splendid quality fit would ever sound so sweet the pasto g r o w
 anything and especially senger service is not properly organized adapted for mixed farming we have yet as the line is
 still in the hands of now 480 acres by next spring several the construction party but as soon as thousand
 more are expected to arrive the line is completed and handed over in the colony and no trouble is being
 to the c n r company then we shall spared to arrange everything for their have a regular service it
 is hard for comfort on their arrival either at saska you in the old country surrounded by toon or edmonton
 every comfort and luxury to realize in the smallest degree what we have all should this letter be made public
 put through the two years in comparand meet the eye of any who may be ative isolation sometimes without the
 desirous of corning out to the colony i slightest idea of what was going on in can only say we
 shall be only too the outside world for a fortnight or three pleased to answer any questions or give weeks
 together for the winter comany information in our power there paratively at the mercy of the weather can be no
 doubt whatever but that the for news or provisions all having to colony will succeed and that lloyd come by
 road from saskatoon and when minster in a few years time will be a they did come the price of
 the commonest very large and prosperous centre but necessity was enough to make the pluck i earnestly hope i have
 ere this dis jest feel downhearted when we saw the pelled all unfavourab le ideas as to our capital we
 had thought ample to carry fortune probably many who have b een us on for a year or so vanishing
 like commiserating our lot have far greater dust almost in bare living it will be need of pity than vie
 for whilst they different when the train is in became are still plodding and hybernating a stock phrase it was
 weary waiting we are on the progressive probably and many of us had almost lost heart making greater headway in
 12 months until one day we heard the rails were than they in as many years for this is laid
 within two miles of lloydminster nothing if not a go ahead country and in less than a week later the
 first train steamed into lloydrninster since best wishes to all old friends in the then there has been quite a
 revolution old country in the price of everything flour which 26 we had paid five dollars per 100 pound late
 and early frosts play such awful bag for is now 2 80 top price and havoc this year we have
 had 50 acres everything else in proportion lumber under cultivation our grain is not too is coming down in price
 town thrashed yet as the threshing outfit has lots have been on the market and bought not been up our
 way yet b ut the general at high prices everyone is now build yield is oats about 50 to 60
 bushels per ing lumber houses instead of the log acre wheat about 25 we had about shack of the old
 timers bricks too two acres of potatoes and a splendid are being extensively used for building crop but alas an
 early frost spoiled and this winter will probably be a pretty half before they could be got out of the
 severe test as to whether they will stand ground from four pounds of seed from the climate or no to
 those like our the experimental farm mr rendell had selves who were amongst the first to a yield of 136
 pounds many of them arrive up in the colony in may 1903 weighing over 20 ounces our garden and at
 most dozen tents were all that produce was splendid we picked could be seen on the bare prairie and several
 cwt of peas and disposed of in now three large hotels are in the course town one restaurant taking nearly
 all of erection stores of all kinds a fine we could supply we have put on a building for the
 branch of the canadian large addition to our house in the shape bank of commerce drug store printing of a
 substantial log building 14 feet office from which is issued weekly our by 18 which will serve to store the
 grain newsy little paper the lloydminster in winter and in summer will be uti times it is just marvellous this
 year lized as a summer kitchen mr rendell has been a good season on the whole is now completing a
 fine stable also for harvest but everything has to be log 30 by 15 we have some good done with
 such a rush the summer sea cows and our milk is disposed of right son is so short one needs
 an infinite away and fetched from the door so that amount of patience in this climate the we have no
 bother gophers innisfail the gophers are catching it from all accounts there will be thousands of tails exhibited in the
 competition on 15 th may for the prizes offered by the agricultural society when driving in the country lately your
 correspondent was amused to see strung up on the barbed wire fence round a farm a multitude of tailless gophers
 to the number of three or four hundred two on every panel this was a true union of the useful
 and the ornamental an excellent device for killing thes pests has been introduced into this district by mr e e
 mccormick late of moscow idaho it takes the form of a set of revolving metal fans with a tube attached
 the tube is filled with burning sulphur and charcoal the fumes from which are driven down the gopher burrows by
 means of fans an exhibition of the powers of the gopher exterminator was given near town lately by mr mccormick
 before a number of interested spectators after the holes had been fumigated they were opened and in every case the
 gophers were found dead the machine cannot fail to be of the greatest possible benefit to the farmers all through
 the gopher belt and ought to do away with the use of poison which at best is a most dangerous
 remedy and at times rather ineffective the wholesale distribution of poison though of course necessary in the absence of other
 means will sooner or later cause fatal accidents to occur amongst both men and animals if indeed harm has not
 already been done and a harmless and inexpensive machine such as this is preferable for more than one reason calgary
