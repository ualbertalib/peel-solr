 81 editorial it is with profound sorrow that the patrician records the death of his majesty king george v while 
 providing a sterling example to all the world of service to his people and steadfast devotion to his duty his 
 late majesty made for himself a place that has never boon equalled by a reigning monarch in the hearts not 
 only of the people of his own empire but of the people of every nation it may bo argued that 
 modern scionco was responsible that by means of radio news reels and a universally free press ho was able to 
 draw more millions into the confidence of his thoughts opinions and deeds but all this modern science and machinery has 
 only suread and intensified tho reputation of the man and tho salient fact still remains that nowhero in tho world 
 has there been a ruler so universally rospoctcd and loved as his late most gracious majesty tho whole world mourns 
 his passing and echoes the cry of all his people he has faithfully laboured may he rest in peace w 
 w m w in the hurried hoy day of royal and provisional schools that prevails after tho now tear at 
 esquimalt the task of publishing a regimental magazine is apt to become a stumbling block of huge proportions this issue 
 of the patrician is offered by tho editors to our patient readers with the cheery if nervous remark it s 
 better late than never there were mumbled somethings about doing better next time and maybe you will be fooled if 
 you say humphl i ve hoard that before although too late to get into our regular columns the arrival of 
 captain j n edgar m c to cormnand the esquimalt station of tho regiment cannot bo allowed to wait until 
 the next issue and a rousing and enthusiastic welcome is herewith extended to him from all ranks at esquimalt it 
 is the hopo of every one of us that he will stay longer than our present 0 c major k 
 c burness m c who we understand is slated for the staff in the very near future on page 104

 as regards the expense entailed in the raising clothing equipping pay transportation feeding maintenance and all other expenditure connected with 
 this battalion in nd out of canada the sum of one hundred thousand dollars will be provided by captain hamilton

 given to the various branches of the depart ment of militia and defence to issue the necessary clothing arms ammunition 
 equipment transport horses stationery and all other articles laid down for the war outfit of a battalion in the various 
 orders and regulations on the subject also the same while in ottawa organizing these will e issued to the battalion

 made by the 1 tterj sums up to a total of one hundred thousand dollars to he received from captain 
 hamilton gault under arrangements the details of which are not yet completed 
 83 8 the above arrangements are to hold good until the discharge of the officers and hen after the return 
 of the battalion to canada 10 aug 1911 signed sam hughes the original charter which is typewritten is now in 
 the historical records of the regiment at winnipeg the word canadian which is underlined twice on the first page of 
 the above copy of the charter was added in ink by the late sir sam hughes then minister of militia 
 and defence we have published the above feeling that it will be of great interest to all members of the 
 regiment from an historical 0:histor 0:ical point of view from the most junior and recently joined we are all aware 
 of the general circumstances surrounding the formation of the regiment and the part plajred in our organization 0:organiz 0:ation by 
 colonel hamilton gault the above charter is the actual authority for the raising of the regiment and marked a red 
 letter day in the history of the canadian military forces the enthusiasm created by the news of this step is 
 remembered by all who lived through those days the wild excitement at the thought of making this regiment and seeing 
 active service ahead of the canadian army as a whole was a tremendous spur to ex service men throughout the 
 country they poured into ottawa by every train regular and not soregular 0:not 0:so 0:regular in such numbers that the 
 regiment was fully recruited and equipped within ten days a record to be proud of and the record of those 
 men who flocked so hurriedly to the colours when they found themselves in france as part of the british expeditionary 
 force and later with the canadian corps is best expressed in the proudest words ever spoken of a regiment they 
 never lost a trench 
 84 it is learnod that major i g colquhoun m c took with him to england a silver tray to 
 deliver to our colonel in chief asking her to present it to her father colonel in chief of the rifle 
 brigade as a token of the honour the p p c l i feel at the affiliation with the rifle 
 brigade this handsome tray was presented by the officers of the ist battalion of the rifle brigade to their regimental 
 quarter master sergeant on his retirement in 1573 after completing 35 years exemplary and efficient service in the regiment it 
 is expected that this token will be accepted and pieced among the silver trophies for safe keeping a company since

 we must at this time mention the splendid christmas dinner so ably prepared by sgt hird and his worthy staff 
 our only regret being the absence of our commanding officer col i iven since the end of the holiday season 
 minto st armouries has been a hive of industry machine gunners trained men recruits and the royal schoel attempting to 
 ca rry out their various syllabuoses of training gives one the impression of a mad house turned loose a casual 
 glance by an outsider would likely strike a humorous note in the conglomeration of movement it is assured though that 
 the trooos have found the training very beneficial the parade for the funeral service of his late majesty king george 
 v wps held at minto st armouries the regiment less b coy together with c bty r c h a 
 a sqn l s h r c r ca f a composite unit of garrison details and a detachment of 
 r c m p the whole over 500 strong formed the parade the unit representatives formed the long side of 
 the hollow oblong a detachment of c bty r c h a fired a salute of 70 rounds from outside 
 the armouries during which time the parade performed the ceremonial movement to rest with their arms reversed 0:revers 0:ed the 
 arade vans moot impressive and one which most of those who took part will wish to recall as a memory 
 to the gracious sovereign for whom they served the galleries of the armouries contained a large number of spectators who 
 were present to view the parade and pay their roupects to the memory of their beloved monarch pte gibson w 
 a i has been elevated to that much desired coterie the married establishment 
 86 machine gun kzchaiiized pl uooii looking at this word mechanized we often wonder if the dictionary provides accurate information 
 because on the 2nd 3rd and 4 th of december the platoon marched to minto street armouries with the rest 
 of the regiment to prepare for the d o c s inspection and on the sth marched once again for 
 the inspection by the district officer co mmanding m d ho 10 on the 9th and 10th of december the 
 annual inspection of regimental signallers was held and we are pleased to note that the following members of the platoon 
 are among that class cpl morton l cpl mac lean l cpl taylor g pte bestick and pte kidd on

 from his injury on the 15th of december cpl miller returned from his trip to fort francis ont he was 
 also posted to the instructional cadre from november ist we wish him the best of luck as usual the christmas 
 estivities were held by the regiment the platoon wishes to take this opportunity to thank a company for their very 
 fine gift and we might say that it is still running during the christmas season very little work or training

 w at the same time 9 other ranks from a company attached to platoon for training in machine gun work 
 on the 6th of january the platoon started training at minto st armouries with h squads of first year men 
 and one of trained men watching elementary gun drill one day recalled a scene at a regimental smoker some years 
 ago when s m i lovelock came on the stage and gave a wrestling exhibition with a tripod as his 
 opponent a few weeks of training makes a great difference and we hope that the training these n c o 
 e and men are having now wili allow the platoon to have as good training if not better than the 
 work that was carried out by the platoon in shilo camp last year sgt jackson f h cpl edwards r 
 s and cpl morton d g were confirmed in their ranks effective 1 4 35 on january 27th pte rice

 completed this course and of much assistance to the platoon next summer when we go out for two or three 
 days on training schemes capt l m black m c left for camp borden ont on january 4 th to 
 work with the r c a f and as we write this has just arrived back cpl edwards proceeded on

 with the platoon for training pte taylor g s was appointed l cpl effective 3 2 36 c o ngratulat 
 i ons hearing so much about x y and z led us to believe that the platoon had some naw 
 kind of a game but we found out that it was just some of the members taking mathematics for the 
 first class educational exams we hope that the fence is not too high regimental band well here we are in 
 1936 the old year has passed but we hope pleasant memories still remain the regimental band through the medium of 
 the patrician 1 desires to extend to all serving and ex members of the regiment good wishes for the new 
 year perhaps a little late but none the less sincere as is customary during the festive season the band was 
 actively engaged playing at various social functions important among them were the childrens xmas tree parties given by the p 
 p 0 l 1 the l s h and the r c a f on the night of xmas eve 
 the band gave a seasonal programme 0:program 0:me in capt j n edgar s quarters later on proceeding to the 
 city to fulfil other engagements xmas day of course came the men s dinner and judging from the groaning festive 
 tables a thoroughly good time was enjoyed by all appropriate music was given including the reg hal rchee of the 
 p p 0 l 1 and the l s h other engagements recently include the making of a gramophone 0:gram 
 0:ophone record contai ing popular canadian airs for the hudson s bay company the closing of the winnipeg grain exchange 
 and the motor exhibition 
 89 usual y we are proud and happy to record the band s engagements 0:engage 0:ments but there is a 
 very recent one of which we can only mention 0:men 0:tion with great sadness we refer to the memorial service 
 held in the winnipeg oivic auditorium on tuesday morning january 2sth when leaders of church and state together with citizens 
 from all walks of life gathered together to cay their final homage to his beloved majesty king george v long 
 before the commencement of the service the hall was filled with sorrowing mourners the service which was broadcast over station 
 c k y opened with the band playing handel s largo in g following the introit and sentences jesu lover 
 of my soul one of his late majesty s favourite hymns was sung and played next came the lesson followed 
 by an anthem from the band entitled 0:en 0:titled for all the saints by vaughan williams after the address came 
 the solemn strains of handel s dead march in saul then another hymn concluding with the national anthem is the 
 mourners filed out the band played the march heroic by saint saens it was a very solemn and impressive service 
 one which we shall never forget it is interesting to record that several members of the band have served under 
 four sovereigns they have played with imperial bands on the occasion of queen victoria s funeral the coronation and funeral 
 of king edward vii the coronatimn of his late majesty king george v and in the princess patricia s canadian 
 light infantry and have olayed during the above mentioned service on the occasion of his death now of course they 
 are still serving a monarch his majesty king edward viii there is little change in the personnel of the band 
 to report although we feel rather apprehensive concerning the future as several valuable soloists are due to leave us shortly 
 on retirement to pension horace swift informs us ho will not honour us with his company at shilo this year 
 do we go to shilo ed as he contemplates 0:con 0:templates proceeding to england somewhere around next may 
 90 bandsman h barrington also expects to breathe his last farewells 0:fare 0:wells to the land of the maple about 
 the same time in september 0:sept 0:ember we shall be losing our solo e flat clarinet sgt b gambles he 
 is looking for a nice sequestered spot in the south of england we note cpl g hill busily scanning the 
 advertising columns of british papers lately on enquiry we learned he has set his heart on a combined hotel and 
 tea gardens situated somewhere 0:some 0:where near the academic atmosphere of historic oxford one or two other members of the 
 band expect soon to return to the old country but the actual dates are not yet known in the meantime 
 with a view to keeping up the strength of the band several men from a company have been attached for 
 mucical training they are very keen and enthusiastic and we wish them every success in mastering the difficult art of 
 music we didn t know young tommy hill son of cpl g hill was an artist until he submitted the 
 cartoon entitled life s what you make it thanks tommy its refreshing in this cynical postwar 0:post 0:war generation to 
 discover someone with a faith in such platitudes 0:plat 0:itudes as we i re captains of our souls and masters 
 of our fates kind of thing frankly if i were captain of my soul i d have brought it up

 91 who was the machine gunner who said spain s national musical 0:mus 0:ical instrument is cascarcts mike toohey wishes 
 he were aladdin cos aladdin had a ring and every time he rang a guihiiess appeared here is one we 
 heard the other day the message came t abraham that he should bear a son and sarah who was listening 
 behind the door laughed sergeant s mess dear mr editor some few years ago a lone entered a small mining 
 townin 0:town 0:in northern manitoba and feeling the desire for something to drink he enquired of a fellow workman where 
 such a thing could be found oh said his friend two streets west and the second 0:sec 0:ond house however 
 as you are a complete stranger she will charge you a dollar but once you are known around the district 
 it will only be fifty cents sandy duly found the house and as the lady opened the door he said 
 with a smile on his face r ell here i am again with the same salutation i greet you now 
 our ancestors discovered that it was indeed a hard job to make bricks without straw and it is just as 
 hard to write an article without matter so when this is finished should it appear much ado about nothing lay 
 not the sin to my charge in winnipeg we arc still in the nidst of winter we are still walking 
 highways and byways that keep till june december snow however maybe when the snows and mists have cleared away when 
 the summer sun again shines a the dancing and sparkling v tors of a thousand little brooks which chatter chatter 
 as they go to join the briny seas when we arc again able to go out and enjoy the wide 
 open spaces and the next issue of the patrician falls due perhaps then we will bo able to give more 
 news of what wo are doing in this wonderful middle west since last writing you we have welcomed to the 
 mess a new member in the form of sgt inst miller i believe he is our youngest member in that 
 first budding spring of youth when all its prospects please we wish him luck and hope he will travel s 
 fast as his namesake george e miller used to do on polo park as we sometimes get a little frost 
 in winnipeg deriiig the winter the mess organized what is known as a curling club i assure you it has 
 nothing whatever to do with a beauty parlour they simply paint rings on tho ice then throw huge stones at 
 them and if you are one of those who loveth nis life then the safest place to stand is as 
 near the ring as possible 
 92 the writer attended the first game accompanied by ed crouch who happened to be covering local sport for the 
 chicago tribune we saw some wicked rocks thrown but if you have read barrio s little minister you will remember 
 where he says to 3aba baba there are higher things in this world than getting what one wants and we 
 must try to find them well there are warmer places in the world than curling rinks so my scribe friend 
 and i set out to find them but the thought which lingered in my mind when i left the rink 
 was this if some men can use a broom at home as well as they can on the ice there 
 s no doubt thats why women were born speaking of r ness sport i may say that a lemon fie 
 without the lemon would be the same as sergeant s mess sport without sgt bliss in fact he is maturing 
 so nicely now that he could almost be described as an all round sport i must pay my humble tribute 
 to freddie who in the role of lester patrick is coaching and managing the hockey team here and i should 
 also like to congratulate him on being awarded his long service and good conduct medal we here always somehow look 
 to the pacific coast for fishing trips and fish stories but here we have our fishermen as well we might 
 term them fishers of men they sit with jerry at their head deciding the best bait and assume the name 
 of whiskey poker school you will no doubt recall in paradise lost the scene where satan is addressing his legions 
 discussing their deoleted fortunes and finishes by saying who can advise may speak well when eddy and jerry get around 
 that corner it seems to come to life again 7i r e held our annual christmas evening on the 21st 
 december and our it home on hew year s day after which two warrant officers and two sergeants took a 
 car and paid an official visit to the various eon permanent sergeant s messes i don t recall major bowes 
 being in winnipeg that day or i should have given that trip credit for providing him with his opening remarks 
 each sunday evening round and round she goes where she stops nobody knows sgt pink is now with us having 
 taken over the duty of provost sgt you haven t changed a bit sgt we held two card parties before 
 new year but i believe the most successful social function of the winter season was the reception given in the 
 mess in honor of c q k s and mrs meachem following their wedding sgt hird and a few more 
 scots were m re convinced than ever that night that canada is a free country vr e wish albert and 
 his good lady all the luck in the world 
 93 as i write this on the 13th february it is beginning to feel like summer outside the temperature is 
 soaring and is now only lb degrees below zero and is such a balny day we can almost 0:al 0:most 
 see shades of shilo and all our little friends there mosquitoes bugs bettlee wasps moths etc and etc waiting to 
 welcome us before lon some members of a company and m c platoon will be talcing an exam for their 
 first class certificate of education 0:ed 0:ucation and before that takes place mr editor as an ardent seeker after knowledge 
 i am sending you a short list here of things we would like to know well i gave myself sixty 
 minutes to write this fifty nine of them have gone forever so once again i extend to you on behalf 
 0:be 0:half of this mess our best wishes for your company your paper and yourself sincerely yours optimist things we 
 would like to know if bill norton still sells flowers and wears blue underwear if sgt pink will ever find 
 those two tons of coal the recipe for joe deßochiefs cough mixture how much bigger sgt dunn will grow now 
 that he is taking root if major colquhoun will bring the hendley cup to winnipeg if our editor has a 
 waste oaoer basket note 2 of them ed where our bowlers go when they leave the alleys and if they 
 are well guarded why sgt bliss does not subscribe to the patrician it is of interest to note that 56 
 members of the regiment have received long service and good conduct medals between january 0:jan 0:uary 1 1921 and december 
 31st 1935 the number of medals issued to personnel of the regiment by years follows 1919 nil 1922 1 1925

 94 esquimau station notes on the 4 th december 1935 a smoking concert was held in the five s court 
 r orlc point barracks when b company had no less than four guests present toward whom to do the honours 
 of the evening brigadier d j macdonald d 5 0 m c recently arrived from ottawa paid us his first 
 social visit on this occasion and was given a rousing welcome by all present toother new arrival was no less 
 a person than our new skipper major k c burness m c who had joined us from winnipeg a few 
 days before this was probably the first time he had seen anything approaching 100 of ssquima lt stati n all 
 together and certainly there was 100 of feeling in the reception given him by all ranks a much less pleasant 
 feature of the evening was the official av revoir said to two of our number major w g colquhoun m 
 c for the last four ears officer commanding ssquimalt station made his farewells his going leaves a very real gap 
 in our ranks and one which we all feel very keenly major colquhoun left on christ mas night for england 
 where he is attending the senior officer s school at sheerness another old timer here sergeant s pink was also 
 with us for the last time that evening sgt pink left the next day for winnipeg where as provost sergeant 
 he is now holding down the job s k i white filled the post of chairman as only he can 
 and marshalled a programme which was well up to our usual high standard it included naturally a few graceful words 
 from each of our guests sgt pink please note sd and a list of entertainers some new talent was uncovered 
 notably pte jordan who is quite a master at the violin mr buster brown a singer well known to most 
 of us was present and obliged with several numbers the evening closed with the singing of the colonel led by 
 major burness our commanding officer lt col h l hivcn d 5 0 m c spent a month at esquimalt 
 and paid ua several visits during his stay here notably among them was the occasion of our christmas 0:christ 0:mas 
 dinner these annual visits of our commanding officer arc a welcome link between winnipeg and esquimalt and make us feel 
 more closely related to our comrades wsy down east whom we so seldom sec en masse 
 95 the children of eaquimalt station had their annual christmas tree in the five s court on 20th december 1935 
 when about 60 youngsters and their parents were the guests of the company games were played until the arrival of 
 santa claus drove more frivolous matters from the mind and the serious business of the day began after the departure 
 of this important personage a very satisfying tea was ierved in ho 3 but to round off an entirely happy 
 afternoon on this occasion we were honoured with the presence of brig and mrs d j macdonald lt col and 
 mrs h w hiven and many friends of the regiment christmas day was its usual jolly self at work point 
 this year replete as always with its turkey plum pudding fruit cakes noise and light happiness again many of our 
 friends gathered with us in the men s mess at dinner time and drank a toast together to this best 
 of all good seasons and the luck of all of us lt col hiven capt carew martin c s m

 day and telegrams 0:tel 0:egrams brought good wishes from the colonel in chief the lady patricia rajnsay and from our 
 comrades at winnipeg came 1936 and on new year s day came forty four members of the c o t

 work started and at the end of their visit ail agreed that a full five days work had been done 
 q m s i a a smith came over with this party to pay us his brief annual visit speaking 
 of schools the main attraction at work point just now is the royal school of infantry which is in progress 
 with some forty hopeful and determined students to date the weather man has been unusually surly but one has merely 
 to read the papers to be assured that not only in victoria is exceptional weather the rule of the day 
 with slightly chattering teeth we breathe a sincere sigh for our friends in the land of 50 below 
 96 tlie new year brought with it the individual training season providing occupation for most of the company several inter 
 platoon transfers have been made and the training of the various me in their new jobs is proceeding apace even 
 the canteen usually held inviolate from shop has echoed incessantly to the to us quite unintelligible jargon of ease pull 
 tap as twelve new machine gunners demonstrate their keeness while recruits and junior nco s each in their alloted corner 
 are pursuing 0:pur 0:suing knowledge with a grim determination such is the thirst for wisdom hereabouts that some thirtyodd 0:thirty 
 0:odd soldiers have made known their decision to become one of the fourteen signallers on our establishment who can draw 
 that extra 10 per diem the signal officer slightly baffled has returned to a corner to work this out by

 sharp increase in business at the station hospital as we go to press some eight members of b company are 
 listed as customers of the roamo fortunately none are now in the serious state although one or two had a 
 pretty heavy time during the last week le hope soon to see all of them back in circulation since the

 the fact that the night before was new year s eve forty tv o members of the contingent managed to 
 get down to pier dby ten o clock from that time things happened rapidly arriving in victoria they were shepherded 
 into trucks and since these were first class transports over forty m p h they arrived at the barracks in 
 ten minutes reveille at six thirty the next morning was rather hard on some of the budding officers and as 
 a result they were four minutes late for parade the day before they had been lectured by a regular army 
 subaltern on being on time at the close of his talk he suddenly 0:sud 0:denly cried everybody double over to 
 the gun shed and back that is everybody but me nov run you 111 h get going i culminating the 
 holiday came saturday night when nearly everyone went out they returned to find their beds apple pied filled with gravel 
 and their pajamas carefully sewed up finally ceremonial and inspection came on sunday the contingent embarked and spent the afternoon 
 dancing with those varsity students returning from victoria to the music of lieut hill it is with great regret that 
 we announce the death of a sergeant b branson at the royal jubilee hospital in victoria on 28th february 1936 
 better known than most members of the garrison sergeant branson leaves behind him a host of friends in all branches 
 of the service who join with his comrades of b company in mourning the loss of a real friend and 
 extending sympathy to mrs branson in her bereavement

 of war by major hamilton gault d s 0 of montreal and was handed over fully equipped to the canadian 
 government it is claimed that the p c ldc had in its original ranks men representative of every regiment in 
 the british army the service record of the regiment has been consistenly brilliant the high quality of the reinforcing drafts
