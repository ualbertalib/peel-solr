 former portion of the blackfeet indian reservation in northern montana was thrown open to prospectors in 1898 some two thousand
 placer and quartz lode mining claims were staked on it by three or four hundred miners and their associates none
 of the mines or claims ever paid off their investors from the sale or processing of the actual ore they
 held and the only money made was through speculation and the sale of shares eventually the greater part of the
 claims reverted to or were acquired by glacier national park of which the area became a part in 1910 many
 of the miners who boomed purchase of a strip of land extending the area were in reality not profession from
 the alberta border south about als at all they were ranchers and other fifty miles for a price of 1
 500 000 on residents from nearby points in alberta june 10 1896 congress confirmed the and montana who hoped to

 few individuals had from personal knowledge a better opportunity of sizing up the causes of the north west outbreak than
 myself i read every document in the department of the interior or on file with the secretary of state in
 connection with that matter from the time of the first agitation for the granting to the half breeds of the
 north west the same privileges that had been granted to those in manitoba regarding lands and scrip that request commenced
 in 1878 the great obstacles to prompt action were the parties who acted with the very best intention they had
 seen that the granting of the lands and scrip to the half breeds in manitoba was a damage rather than
 a benefit to 99 of them the half breeds had sold their rights vinced that if the whites were exterfor
 a song and utilized the proceeds minated or driven out of the country chiefly for whiskey it was desirous the
 buffalo would come back in the that whatever aid was given to those in myriads that they had been a
 few years the north west should be so locked up previous in 1883 r w hermon dominthat they could only
 use the interest on ion land surveyor who was engaged in the investment and the delay arose as the examination
 of contract surveys beto who should be the trustees of this tween prince albert and battleford met fund and how
 it should be administered the honorable charles noliri who was one peculiarity was that the half breeds at that time
 in the employ of the indian in manitoba who had participated in department nolin assured hermon that lands and scrip
 assumed that if they if the whites were only driven out of were residing in the north west tern the
 country the buffalo would come tories they would get lands and scrip back as plentiful as they had ever been
 again and it was these half breeds who were the chief agitators riel seem i will give a little biography

 fact that those mani but i think we must admit that he betoba half breeds who in the 1869 riel

 of manitoba to canada he the same expression was used by however was always bitter against the the blackfoot indians

 1874 or 1876 i piece of vacant prairie one day and peram not certain which my party met the haps
 the next day for four or five miles 20 2 j and i found the most contradictory opinions and if
 there was any merit in doing so i might now record them but i will confine myself to one case
 the rev bishop of st albert bishop grandin made a visit to prince albert in the autumn of 1884 and
 on route to a ‘ his home he passed through calgary where he remained several days he ‘ was so
 worried about the conditions as ‘ he found them at batoche that he asked i v the bishop of st
 boniface bishop tache to come up to calgary and meet him and 1 they would discuss the situation bishop ‘
 1 ‘ ‘ tache did so and told bishop grandin to go home and make himself quite t q ‘
 i ‘ ‘ comfortable that riel was irresponsible i c and his movement would not amount f g to anything
 when the riel rebellion broke out bishop tache had an interview pub lished in the winnipeg papers in which he
 stated that the government was whol ly to blame that he had been advising them for years to settle this
 matter and centre of controversy during the settlement of they had done nothing that the matter the canadian west was
 louis riel this sketch had not been settled was due largely to was published by l opinion publique in 1873
 action taken by himself it would be literally covered with teams in addition to reading all the official material and
 men and they used the ex documents on the matter the premier pression they must have come up out of
 canada in january 1885 sent me all of the ground they actually knew that private and confidential letters that he
 they were being moved ahead had received and asked me to go through them and give him a memorandum there
 the fact that the blackfoot blood and on and my conclusions on the matter peigan indians probably also the if
 my views on the matter had been con sarcees did not take part with the north fined to what was
 revealed by those em indians in the riel rebellion was letters i would have been unable to almost wholly owing
 to the building of arrive at any conclusion the opinions the canadian pacific railway in 1883 and advice were so
 contradictory which impressed the blackfoot with the power behind the whites that influence in 1884 the government had decided was
 increased too by the rev father to appoint a half breed commission to lacombe as far as the crowfoot and
 this deal with the claims of the half breeds band of indians were concerned to scrip on the same lines
 as had been accorded to residents in manitoba at the riel came over from montana about time of the transfer
 the question arose may or june 1884 and to some extent who was to be on that commission and his
 advent set the heather on fire dur my opinion was asked i had no hesitaing that year i was engaged
 in investi tion in saying that if there was one man gating claims at battleford and along who should be
 placed thereon it was the saskatchewan as far west as ed ro er goulet monton and i was instructed by
 the u department of the interior to obtain all when the department of the interior the information i could regarding
 riel was first organized l russell then chief his agitation and supporters i did so of the department on the
 ground had 21 engaged goulet on behalf of the govern if he would join his government goulet ment particularly in
 respect to claims refused and he was kept there for two arising under the manitoba act early weeks when riel
 discovered that his after my advent in manitoba i was action in arresting him was injuring his thrown in contact
 with him and was cause and he let him out very greatly and most favorably impressed particularly as to his
 ability and there is always a great deal of difhonesty and rigid principles through ficulty in getting good interpreters and
 his honesty and his knowledge of the dif such has been almost impossible where ferent half breed families which was
 technical matters required interpretamarvellous particularly as to the me tion a man may be a very good interliability of their
 evidence he saved the pretem in interpreting ordinary cree or country hundreds of thousands if not other indian languages into
 ordinary millions of dollars in avoiding spurious english but when it comes to interpretclaims ing technical language either in english
 or french into another language he is i was instructed to sound goulet and wholly at sea find out if
 he would accept a position on the 1885 commission when in a rather amusing incident occurred march the half breed
 commission was in connection with the trial for treason being constituted goulet intimated that of certain indians and half breeds
 for he would not go as he had been engaged their actions during the 1885 uprising by some prominent dealers
 in scrip and among others one arrow was the head lands to follow the commission around of a small band
 of indians situated imand secure land and scrip rights from mediately east of batoche and adjacent the half breeds to
 the river lots in the parish of st laurant this fellow like most of the i advised the department of
 the in indians in that district took to the wartenor that if i could see goulet i thought path i
 could persuade him to go on the commission i was dispatched from ottawa the trials for treason took place at
 to organize the commission and try and regina i had hoped to obtain a copy secure goulet s services which
 i suc of the old form of indictment but so far ceeded in doing by making an appeal to have
 not succeeded and can only speak his patriotism he lost a good deal from memory it wound up after recitfinancially
 by his decision ing the actions of the indians or accused somewhat as follows there is one very interesting incident
 in roger goulet s life which i would like and thereby you insulted her to relate he is the only
 man i ever majesty the queen and trampled on came across who was sent to jail be her crown and

 one of the few french half breeds in reply one arrow exclaimed i who were outstanding in their opposi never

 and the respect general came under my ken in connection with ly that they had for him he would have
 the settling of claims which may be of been a very strong factor in riel s interest cabinet and riel
 did everything he in about 1890 the indian department could to persuade him to join with him officials came to
 the conclusion that but without avail offering him the posi whereas in their bands there were a tion of minister
 of customs he there large percentage who were not really fore sent a squad one night and had pure indians
 but more or less had other goulet arrested and put in jail but than indian blood in their veins that

 that his assertion would be very interesting and valuable was correct and it was seldom that his if they were
 gathered together and put statement regarding a law point was on record senator richard hardisty disputed in fact it was
 gratifying to probably did more than any other one witness the case in court being conindividual to prevent the general
 up ducted by mr robinson when he made rising in sympathy with riel among the a statement to the bench
 that such was half breeds and indians in the north the law on a point it was invariably he had
 a personal acquaintance with all accepted by them and his opponent unthe leaders of both indians and half less he
 happened to be young and inbreeds extending over more than 30 experienced would never dispute him years and had a
 wonderfully good as to ability in cross questioning durreputation for honesty and veracity he ing his time mr oslem was
 without a watched the agitation closely and was peer in the canadian bar when the outbreak took place living in
 calgary he proceeded forthwith to ed those who acted for the defence monton and travelled about among these were to
 some extent handicapped from people continually till the crisis was the fact that their practice had been over largely under
 the french code and they were not familiar with the practice at i happened to be present at the trial
 that time in the north west territories of riel the judge who tried him was the result was that during
 that trial the senior stipendiary magistrate for whatever mr robinson said was the the north west territories j u d

 gave him the for the prisoner that riel had offered appointment to get rid of him thinking that if he
 were paid 38 000 he would that he was sufficiently well fitted to give up his agitation and return to
 dispense justice in the north west montana 24 the trial of louis riel was sketched by a newspaper artist in

 and magistrate le jeune in foreground are crown counsel c robinson with hand to ear and supt b b deane
 seated at right there were several witnesses for the therefore he could give better evidence crown but the chief one
 was thomas than if excited that is a point i think mckay of prince albert in the address that many
 of us might well consider to the jury by mm robinson he delivered after the crown had closed the case
 panegyric on the conduct of mckay and the defence was taken up and so far as the manner in which
 he gave his i can now remember the only witness evidence mckay had gone to see riel called by the
 defence was dr roy who and his council immediately after the was then and had been for some time fight
 at duck lake in order to expostu the medical superintendent and manalate with them as to what would happen gem
 of the beauport lunatic asylum if they persisted in acting as they had situated on the north side of the
 st he was almost certain that he would be lawrence a few miles below quebec arrested and there was the
 possibility of his being shot by riel in that asylum in i think 1883 and there was one thing that
 struck me part of 1884 riel had been an inmate as very peculiar in the rendering of mc probably a
 patient the defence staked kay s evidence he spoke in a very low everything on attempting to prove that voice
 so much so that he had repeated riel was insane and during the evidence ly to be requested to speak
 a little given by dr roy on that point the louder after he left the box in conver prisoner repeatedly
 jumped up and exsation with him i asked him why he claimed that he would sooner be exspoke in such
 a low tone naturally when ecuted than be proven insane whether animated he spoke rather loudly and his that was
 done for effect or whether it general tone was fairly loud his reply was a genuine exclamation on the part
 to me was that by speaking low it pre of riel it is difficult to say vented him from getting
 excited and it might be well to state just here 25 that dr roy started to give his evidence he
 then asked the witness to repeat in french but it was so badly bungled his definition of the peculiar type
 of inby the interpreter that he turned to riel s sanity that the prisoner manifested when counsel and said that
 he would prefer in the asylum and dr roy repeated the to give his evidence in english rather medical term
 that he had given sir than have it interpreted as it was he charles fitzpatrick mr osler then spoke english
 very well one would not asked him to give it to him in ordinary have imagined that he could give
 it bet english as he did not understand what ter in english no matter how well it was that term
 meant and there would posinterpreted sibly be some of the jury who did not the last question asked him by
 the and to give it to him in terms that they counsel was what particular type of all could understand
 then dr roy reinsanity did the prisoner manifest when peated what he had given in his he was in the
 beauport asylum dr evidence in chief ‘ that the prisoner was roy gave the technical name for it a victim
 of an impulse over which he which was somewhat like megaloma had no control he was then requested nia but
 that is not exactly what he to repeat it and repeat it slowly and he said he was asked by
 sir charles fitz then repeated again what he had before patrick what that term meant in ordin stated mr osler
 then turned quite ary english and he replied when a sharply to him and said now i want man is
 a victim of an impulse over which you to adhere to that definition he he has no control at that
 point the then propounded the following question evidence in chief closed if the prisoner was the victim of an impulse
 over which he had no control the cross examination was at once how do you account for the fact that
 he taken up by mr osler as far as i offered to sell out that impulse for 38 could judge
 mr osler was particularly 000 desirous of annoying dr roy as much it could readily be seen that dr roy
 as he could so that he could thereby break down his evidence to a greater or was very much surprised
 and annoyed less extent at the question and he appealed in french to his counsel mr fitzpatrick beauport asylum was
 at that time who at once got up and said that he and had been for some years controlled was
 taking an unfair advantage of the by a joint stock company the inmates witness as his knowledge of english of
 it were farmed out by the province was not sufficient mr osler then said paid a per diem rate for
 medical atten the witness can understand english as tion board and shelter mr osler drew well as anyone in this
 court this all out of him and put as annoying a construction on his evidence as he mr fitzpatrick tried
 to mollify the could among other things he told him evidence of dr roy by asking one or that there
 was no inducement in his two questions and then he turned to institution to cure a man as the longer
 mr osler and said go on with your he remained the more money the pro questions now mr osler said
 i have prietors including the witness himself no more questions to ask the case made and characterized it as just

 a boy the winter of 1906 07 seemed to me to be one of continued cold and hardship at the
 time we lived at innisfail which was a small town devoid of the modern conveniences of light and water although
 we did have a telephone the weather ranged around 60 degrees below zero for days at a time and it
 was tough enough living in town so i don t know what the poor homesteaders and farmers who had to
 keep their stock and families alive and warm had to put up with there were four of us older boys

 boys lined which anywhere from five to eight were up with two pails apiece and we ran milking six horses
