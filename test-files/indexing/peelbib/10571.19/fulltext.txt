 the erection of a memorial to patricias who fell at the battle of frezenberg 8 may 1915 before the battalion

 hockey championships in oslo norway 0:nor 0:way right now everything is in a tizzy with people running around getting band 
 equipment packed and in the same breath dropping around to the mir for needles but it s all worth it 
 considering what lies ahead this has been a quiet summer for the band but not a dull one our last 
 trip away from home base was to the band summer school in wainwright 0:wain 0:wright the first week in july

 these courses were designed to reduce even further the number of unqualified 0:unqua 0:lified personnel in the battalion to date 
 there are only twelve so we have now raised our sights for every group one to become a group two 
 our first concentration this year was in borkenberge between 27 february 0:fe 0:bruary and 2 march each rifle company in 
 turn spent a day and night of training which consisted of dry and wet section and platoon exercises with battalion 
 supporting 0:support 0:ing arms instruction on the man packed flame thrower and a night firing demonstration followed by company night 
 firing by sections in addition to borkenberge each company has had two days on the menden or hemer classification ranges 
 the weather was for the most part bearable and rifle and lmg scores were quite good with march 31 has 
 come the end of individual training and the beginning 0:be 0:ginning of phase ii or sub unit training with emphasis 
 on teamwork 0:team 0:work rather than individualism much to the amazement and amusement of the local inhabitants and to the 
 consternation of the rest of the brigade if they wanted any information during the day the unit went on night

 major cv lilley lt col hw niven week this commenced on 14 april and by the time it terminated all 
 ranks were fairly well used to the routine of reveille at 1800 hours and lights out at 0600 hours this 
 week of nights was instituted to rectify the state of the unit s efficiency in night operations and with the 
 odd humorous incident this aim was achieved at 0600 hours 25 april the battalion 0:batta 0:lion left fort macleod for 
 sennelager 0:senne 0:lager by march route and by 1500 hours were concentrated in their bivouac area 3 miles from brigade 
 headquarters after covering a distance 0:dis 0:tance of 21 5 uphill miles only a few men fell out there were 
 numerous blistered feet mainly those of battalion headquarters 0:head 0:quarters personnel who did not get the opportunity for hardening training 
 0:train 0:ing the second day was the worst of the entire march unaccustomed muscles were stiff and to get going 
 after the 10 minute halts was sheer agony on the final day stiffness seemed to be leaving everybody and marching 
 0:march 0:ing was falling into a routine most seemed to be good for another 100 miles after a day s 
 rest training started 0:start 0:ed with a bang on the 29th april the ranges were familiar from the previous year 
 making recess unnecessary 0:un 0:necessary due to the large numbers 0:num 0:bers required for the skill at arm teams platoon 
 training was carried out except for the two days that companies were on infantry tank training infantry tank training began 
 with familiarization and drills progressing 0:progress 0:ing through a day of troop platoon attacks and culminating in a com 
 the patrician 11 pany squadron exercise advance to contact and attack two companies 0:com 0:panies were exercised at the same 
 time one with a squadron royal canadian dragoons and the other with c squadron second royal tank regiment the latter 
 proved to be well trained tankers sennelager culminated in the brigade small arms and skill at arms meets from 15 
 to 17 june 1957 in the brigade small arms meet although we lost the lmg and smc we won the 
 officers and rank and file rifle and pistol lt dm setten led the high individual score on rifle with pte 
 hansen kw second s sgt buxton rg dcm led the high in individual pistol score in the brigade skill at 
 arms meet things were different we found our main competition came from 1 field squadron royal canadian engineers 0:engin 0:eers 
 who only had to field teams one quarter the size of ours there was no dangerous competition from the major 
 units we won the lmg map using grenade placed second in rifle and third in the pistol and smc on 
 the aggregate we won the skill at arms shield for the second 0:se 0:cond time in germany after sennelager a 
 period of refresher training in field work was undergone to prepare the battalion for it s final concentration in germany 
 0:ger 0:many trooping the colour after the sennelager concentration 0:concentra 0:tion full attention was turned toward 0:to 0:ward trooping rehearsals 
 and by 14 june a very promising dress rehearsal 0:rehear 0:sal completed the training this year we were fortunate in 
 having with us major general ae potts cbe ed who consented to take the salute on the dress rehearsal june 
 15 dawned clear and warm what we may have come to call patricia weather and held throughout 0:through 0:out the 
 day at 1430 hours markers were called and with a huge attendance 0:at 0:tendance the trooping ceremony commenced the lady 
 patricia ramsay arrived 0:ar 0:rived gave her permission to troop and the entire ceremony proceeded like clockwork it was certainly 
 one of our finest troopings and very grateful are we to have been able to show this to our colonel 
 in chief on 19 june the majority of the unit proceeded to putlos for a week on the ranges the 
 weather was magnificent allowing the qualification 0:qualifica 0:tion of great numbers on all weapons 0:wea 0:pons putlos also proved to 
 be a training break in that those not firing 0:fir 0:ing on any particular day were transported to one of 
 the excellent beaches in the area the weather recreation and success in qualification 0:qualifica 0:tion made putlos one of the 
 most enjoyable concentrations of our stay in europe dortmund dominion day celebrations on 27 28 and 29 june the brigade 
 held it s annual dominion day celebrations 0:cele 0:brations in the dortmund sports arena this consisted of an inter unit 
 sports meet a midway supplied 0:sup 0:plied by all units and a grandstand program on the final day this unit 
 s contribution was a food booth and western display for the midway 0:mid 0:way and in conjunction with 4th regiment 
 royal canadian horse artillery a feu de joie as the final part of the military tattoo this consisted of six 
 guards of 44 all ranks and four guns from 4th regiment 0:regi 0:ment royal artillery on 8 aug our advance 
 party left for soltau to commence a two week bde training period which included practically all phases of war on 
 termination of soltau except for one or two unit courses most of the bn training ceased to make way for 
 preparation to move back home to canada 
 the patrician 12 in all the period spent in germany has been extremely worth while from the training point of 
 view because 0:be 0:cause of the more abundant areas and ranges and a semi operational role allowing the opportunity of 
 spending considerable more time in field training than in canada the unit has reached a state of proficiency 0:profi 0:ciency 
 bordering on the ideal the problem now is to maintain this high standard at home inter company sports spring brought 
 to a close the winter 0:win 0:ter portion of the inter company sports program floor hockey created a great deal

 from the foothills 0:foot 0:hills city were just unable to click this season the rcha and rcr were able to 
 take us quite handily at first but later games found us running neck and neck into the late innings only 
 to go down by a last minute twist of fate however they did manage to rally on occasion and out 
 of sheer determination beat the league leading van doo 3 out of their 4 meetings the flash was weak but 
 the spirit never failed officers mess after the new year the mess remained 0:re 0:mained quiet as long as any 
 mess can but finally broke loose on feb 16 with a valentines ball as with all of our functions in 
 europe it proved highly entertaining and pleasantly intoxicating mess life then again reverted to a rather quiet period in which 
 normal 0:nor 0:mal saturday night routines were carried on until the awe inspiring event of the birthday of our colonelin 
 chief 0:colonel 0:in 0:chief the normal mess dinner managed to run into the next day and we are certain that 
 the consumption 0:con 0:sumption of moose milk and lack of sleep on the part of our team were the deciding 
 factors in losing the coveted broom i loo trophy to the sergeants but of course grudges can t be harboured 
 and we had several drinks in our mess afterwards with our adversaries the ball that night was well prepared 0:pre 
 0:pared and managed and even though some members were tiring rapidly it continued well into the morning this occasion was 
 greatly enhanced by the presence of jenny morris our london mother who was with us for this period in the 
 month of may the unit moved on foot to sennelager where the mess continued to operate 0:oper 0:ate under more 
 frugal conditions than usual only two things seemed to be good antidotes for the cold weather an outdoor fire place 
 for which support company officers procured most of the wood and an officers sergeants party which climaxed in a boat 
 race both teams were disqualified but needless to say this led to challenges between various officers and the rsm all 
 of which were won by the latter on returning from sennelager we had a home coming party designed to appease 
 our wives there followed a period of inactivity 0:in 0:activity during which preparations were being made for the trooping on 
 jun 14 we had the mess dinner 0:din 0:ner attended by all the battalion officers and some very distinguished 0:distin

 ball which was also attended by innumerable distinguished 0:distin 0:guished guests including the colonel in chief we rented a marquee 
 from the naafi and decorated it with streamers in the regimental colours fortunately there was no need for the tent 
 heaters for we were enjoying the best weather westphalia has seen for two years on the monday following the ball 
 the unit went to putlos for annual weapons classifications rather than spend our free time in the mess most members 
 took advantage 0:ad 0:vantage of the fine weather by bird watching on the baltic beaches on jun 26 we were 
 fortunate enough to receive a very beautiful gift major general potts has presented the mess with a large and handsome 
 radio phonograph which in it s appearance enhances the looks of the recently redecorated mess and which is also greatly 
 appreciated 0:ap 0:preciated for it s excellent tone we all offer our sincerest thanks to major general potts in july 
 we lost one of our officers major ge henderson cd who went back to canada to become infantry adviser at 
 the school of artillery in shilo we held a farewell 0:fare 0:well party for him and mrs henderson 0:hen 0:derson 
 on july 6 where we all gave him our best wishes for the future on 18 july a dining in 
 and stag night was called for captain brian simons our signals officer who was about to leave the ranks of 
 the living in for the somewhat dubious pleasure of married life for those who know the form on stags we 
 can say that this was no exception in early august two events very different in character took place the first 
 a going away party for mrs rowley and the second the subaltern s protective association s annual mess dinner we 
 are happy that both were successful and that no senior bones were broken in the latter sergeants mess on 4

 0:fac 0:tor of the night and we won by a forty point margin our second colonel in chief s birthday 
 in germany was a wonderful 0:won 0:derful affair greatly enhanced by the presence of the london mother jenny macgregor morris 
 who was brought over from england 0:eng 0:land for the occasion of course no 17 march is complete without an 
 officers versus sergeants broom i loo game it was as spirited as usual and who won you guessed it the

 the patrician 32 issued under special supplementary 0:supple 0:mentary warrant no 012 854 london 0:lon 0:don gazette 1 january 1867 
 to timothy o hae first battalion the rifle brigade probably the most unusual award of the victoria cross ever made 
 was that to private rifleman timothy o hae this decoration is of very distinctive 0:dis 0:tinctive interest being the only 
 cross ever awarded for an act of valour performed in other than actual warfare 0:war 0:fare it is also the 
 only cross awarded to date for heroism in canada the circumstances were as follows 0:fol 0:lows during the fenian troubles 
 of 1866 it became necessary to move a large supply of ammunition including 0:in 0:cluding ninety five barrels of gunpowder 
 0:gun 0:powder from quebec city to lake erie this was done in great secrecy the consignment was placed in charge 
 of o hae and three other picked men of the rifle brigade and attached to a regular passenger train which 
 was conveying some eight hundred immigrants to the west on 19 june 1866 as the train drew into danville not 
 far from quebec o hae noticed that one of the ammunition cars was on fire and as soon as the 
 train stopped gave the alarm on being informed of the contents 0:con 0:tents of the burning freight car everyone in 
 the vicinity of the station 0:sta 0:tion withdrew to a safe distance this exodus included all railway officials a company 
 of infantry which was drawn up on the station platform and o hae s three companions 0:com 0:panions having found 
 a bucket a ladder and a supply of water o hae mounted the burning car no less than nineteen times 
 and entirely without assistance succeeded in extinguishing 0:ex 0:tinguishing the fire the task took him almost an hour during which 
 time he was repeatedly ordered by both civil and military officials to leave the train to it s fate the 
 immigrants who were german 0:ger 0:man and who in accordance with the custom of the time were locked in their 
 carriages could not see or understand what was going on they remained the whole time in complete ignorance of their 
 dire peril a military board which enquired into the incident credited o hae with the probable saving of almost a 
 thousand lives and recommended him for the award of the victoria cress o hae was born in ireland and was 
 only twenty years of age at the time of his exploit he left the service 0:ser 0:vice on returning to 
 england and joined the new zealand constabulary 0:con 0:stabulary in 1874 o hae joined an expedition 0:expedi 0:tion into the 
 far north west of australia 0:aus 0:tralia then largely unexplored early in november 1874 he and the leader of the 
 party perished from thirst in sturt s desert on leaving civilization o hae left his personal belongings including his cross 
 in the care of a friend when the sad details of the tragedy became known the cross was presented 0:pre 
 0:sented to the australian national gallery where it remained on display 0:dis 0:play for many years recently as the result 
 of happy agreement between australian officials 0:of 0:ficials and the regiment rifleman o hae s cross returned home it is

 the last notes we see that we had briefly mentioned that the regiment hoped to start a young soldiers course 
 in the summer 0:sum 0:mer of 1957 now that the summer is leaving us we can report that not only 
 did the young soldiers course take place but that it was an outstanding 0:outstand 0:ing success starting with only the 
 germ of an idea from brigadier jenner 0:jen 0:ner and lt col bradburn lt col wh buchanan activated the young 
 soldier company and with the assistance 0:as 0:sistance of militia group and western command officers and nco s ran a 
 first class course that resulted in over 130 young men between 0:be 0:tween the ages of 16 and 19 obtaining 
 0:ob 0:taining their leading infantrymans certificate commencing in june and running until the middle of august the boys paraded every 
 day except sunday and culminated their training with a two week field training concentration at camp wainwright the boys trained 
 in the camp area throughout their stay at wainwright and an overnight bivouac scheme was included in their syllabus the 
 latter was a great success although one subaltern 0:subal 0:tern who shall remain nameless succeeded in keeping the rest of 
 the company awake half the night by running a weiner roast for his platoon if anyone is interested in obtaining 
 some slightly used but cut price weiners will they please contact 2 lt don wade at 22740 the course ended 
 on a note of firstclass 0:first 0:class hilarity with the camp concert 0:con 0:cert to end all camp concerts we 
 observed csm jack shields one of the course instructors being quite hysterical over one skit involving the cos driving habits

 80 boys have signified their intention to join the unit for the fall and winter training season 0:sea 0:son this 
 year plans call for the regiment to parade all day every saturday at griesbach barracks with instruction to be given 
 by regular ppcli instructors the advantages 0:ad 0:vantages in this for the militia can readily be seen and it is 
 hoped that after this training the unit will be the best trained militia unit in canada everyone connected with planning 
 0:plan 0:ning is most enthusiastic and the co operation shown by ppcli has been very encouraging it must be noted 
 that for the young soldier training scheme several ppcli ncos who took part postponed 
 the patrician 34 their annual leave until the end of the course to ensure continuity of training a typical gesture 
 of the goodwill that was received all the way down the line the regular militia unit continued 0:con 0:tinued to 
 parade during the spring and summer and again sent a contingent 0:con 0:tingent to wainwright summer camp a colour party 
 under lt dw harrison turned out for the annual church parade of the 49th bn association in june and although 
 the party was formed on very short notice it evoked much favourable comment from all who witnessed the parade now 
 we look forward to the fall and with it an even closer association 0:associa 0:tion with ppcli without doning rose 
 coloured glasses it can safely be said that the outlook for the regiment has not been as bright for many 
 years and government willing we should be able to look back on the year 1957 as a most memorable one

 the patrician 35 province of alberta skiing in alberta you either love it or you don t like it at 
 all there are some sports that you can do half way and enjoy 0:en 0:joy you can play a half 
 good game of tennis swim enough to stay up or known enough about badminton 0:badmin 0:ton to play a passable 
 game and enjoy every minute of these sports but when it comes to skiing you either love it and are 
 good at it or you don t care for it at all you either enjoy every second in the fresh 
 air on the powdery white slopes schussing down the hill even plodding back up herringbone 0:herring 0:bone style with dogged 
 determination 0:determina 0:tion if there s no chair or rope tow handy or you don t like it at all 
 in alberta during the winter days there s an ever growing group of people joining the we love skiing 0:ski 
 0:ing group or so it seems banff which began its days as an exclusive 0:exclu 0:sive summer resort resounds winter 
 weekends to the thud of ski boots on snow the happy laughter of bemittened 0:be 0:mittened skiers all set to 
 climb into car or bus for the trip up mount norquay and a wonderful day of skiing or the others 
 ready to step into sunshine suzy that incongruous 0:incon 0:gruous looking six wheeled snow mobile which gathers skiers for the 
 trip across country to the skiing resort of sunshine some of alberta s pioneers looked into the future and envisioned 
 0:en 0:visioned a banff such as this enveloped in the white eiderdown of snow blankets which stretch up and up 
 into the surrounding mountains 0:moun 0:tains drawing skiers to the grand skiing country beyond one evening back in 1916 norman 
 0:nor 0:man k luxton that man famous for his around the world canoe trip and his lawyer friend b w 
 collison were sitting before a crackling fire enjoying each other s company both their families had gone away leaving them 
 to their own resources for a few days so it was that they sat together smoking 0:smok 0:ing and chatting 
 lazily one of the passing subjects which caught and held their attention was promoting 0:pro 0:moting banff as a winter 
 as well as summer resort after lengthy discussion they decided there was nothing for it but a banff winter carnival 
 so without losing any time they wired ottawa for support of the venture since banff was then and still is 
 a ward of the federal 
 the patrician 36 government a reply was promptly received pledging ottawa s support of the venture and a few hundred 
 dollars for its promotion next they got the citizens of banff behind the carnival idea and the first one was 
 set for february 12th 1917 at its first carnival banff had a wide variety of sports and competitions 0:com 0:petitions 
 to offer there was the popular ski joring race on the bow river in it a man on skis would 
 hold onto a rope pulled by a horse at the signal the race would begin horse and man flying across 
 the ice at a great rate another sport which most everyone took a turn at was tobogganing down specially built 
 runs one chinaman aptly described this sport in a very few words his description whiz z z walk a mile 
 another feature event of the early carnivals was the dog derby run from calgary to banff the race was a 
 two day grind for men and dogs with the teams ending in banff completely exhausted but somehow still game the 
 names of ike mills and harry knight took top honors many times in these races a man by the well 
 known name of brewster in this case jim brewster 0:brew 0:ster also did his part to open up the canadian 
 rockies for winter sports and mainly skiing he had begun to learn this country of mountains and streams as a 
 very early lad and at the tender age of 13 began work in earnest with a modest pack outfit the 
 year was 1895 during his many years in the rockies jim brewster had sunshine 0:sun 0:shine ski lodge built as 
 a stopping place for skiers in the very heart of the country he knew and loved along with this jim 
 had the columbia 0:colum 0:bia icefield chalet erected too with these lodges it was possible for skiers to enter the 
 heart of the rockies to ski and live in comfort there in the wilderness those same formative years around 1895 
 saw the start of banff s first skating rink along the pines on the bow river the skaters asked mr 
 william mather operator of the boathouse if he d be so kind as to keep the rink cleared for a 
 nominal fee from each skater he agreed to do this and eventually became rink manager a funny incident took place 
 on this same rink in 1904 it seems that the banff ladies had challenged the calgary ladies to a hockey 
 game at the bow river rink in the course of the game the banff girls scored a goal then to 
 make sure they d retain this hard won lead the girls stood in front of their own goal and methodically 
 left their great ankle length skirts down just enough to sweep the ice by an inch or so the calgary 
 girls were stumped they couldn t get a shot on goal past those skirts and the referee a dignified person 
 in stiff christie and the next thing to a frock coat simply refused to ask the ladies to raise their 
 skirts as a result the banff ladies team won that game nowadays one of the oldtimers who witnessed this game 
 of strategy and got a good chuckle out of it still enjoys a winter afternoon skate on the open air 
 rink across the bow river his name is mr george paris one of the newest innovations in the banff winter 
 carnival held in 1954 from february 10th to 14th were the skiing and jumping races on mount norquay this particular 
 mountain only five miles from banff by a good road has been called the answer to a tournament official s 
 0:of 0:ficial 0:s prayer one of its biggest attractions for expert skiers is the chairlift which was built by one

 the patrician 38 trails on the upper part of mount norquay there are many wonderful skiing 0:ski 0:ing spots in 
 alberta for instance one particular location was chosen by the war office back in 1943 for training a unit in 
 mountain and ski warfare the location was jasper 0:jas 0:per national park and the unit was the lovat scouts a 
 famous scots regiment with a strong core of hardy highlanders who had been gillies stalkers shepherds and the like the 
 training area formation of a training team numbering one hundred instructors and a supply of special united states army clothing 
 0:cloth 0:ing and equipment were all left up to chief instructor of the training team f s smythe and a 
 military commission under the command of brigadier c n barclay dso the lovat scouts were amazed at the beauty of 
 this wide open canadian country their headquarters 0:head 0:quarters was in jasper lodge which at that time was one of 
 the largest log buildings in the world and the lodge plus the neighboring town of log cabins surrounded by lakes 
 pines and mountains had them completely 0:com 0:pletely amazed the training period of from december to april left them even 
 more astonished for these hardy lovat scouts learned their snowcraft from the ground up they slept in tents snowholes and 
 bush bivouacs on some schemes sometimes 0:some 0:times at heights of around 10 000 feet many stories are told about 
 the training these men underwent one thing certain they learned to ski even though a few bones were broken in 
 the process their most extensive ski grounds were found to lie west and south of maligne lake cross country routes 
 of fifty miles and more were set up high passes were crossed by these men and peaks in the then 
 little known brazeau range climbed one cabin which the scouts particularly liked was snowball cabin near maligne in the mountains 
 to the northwest it was designed and built by curly phillips of jasper and was a special work of art 
 which lived up to its nickname of shangrila 0:shangri 0:la curly phillips was lost after he built it getting caught 
 in a sudden avalanche besides banff s mount norquay skiing enthusiasts in that part of alberta can enjoy the sport 
 at sunshine 0:sun 0:shine sixteen miles from banff by sunshine suzy the six wheeled snowmobile a little deeper in the 
 rockies looms mount assiniboine sometimes called the matterhorn of the rockies and a paradise for more experienced skiers lake louise 
 lodge a quarter of a mile east of the station at the banff jasper highway junction gives accommodation for those 
 skiing around lake louise in the bow valley 0:val 0:ley and further from this spot lies ptarmigan valley mount temple 
 chalet and much praised skoki jasper 0:jas 0:per has a good december to june skiing season with a rope tow 
 on whistler s mountain and then there s the columbia icefield the list is endless and because of its great 
 variety the skiers in alberta native and visitor alike are gradually 0:gradu 0:ally growing in number but wherever 0:wher 0:ever
