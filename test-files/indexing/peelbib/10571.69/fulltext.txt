 1 the patrician 2006 colonel in chief message from the colonel in chief the right honorable countess mountbatten of burma 
 cbe cd jp dl i am very pleased to have the honour of providing the opening comments for the patrician 
 2006 was a year marked by mixed emotions i was delighted to have the opportunity to celebrate the regiment s 
 successes and the outstanding achievements of my patricias at the same time i mourned the loss of the brave men 
 and women who died serving canada in afghanistan and lebanon and thought often of their families and the families and 
 friends of the soldiers who continue to serve overseas it was also a year of mixed feelings for me as 
 i reached the difficult decision to relinquish my appointment as your colonel in chief a rich and deeply rewarding experience 
 2006 was a very busy year patricias continued to make important contributions to international peace and security the regiment was 
 heavily committed to operations in afghanistan soldiers from all three battalions the loyal edmonton regiment and e company lord strathcona 
 s horse royal canadians served with distinction in difficult and extremely demanding circumstances the regiment continued its traditions of leadership 
 and excellence setting the conditions for nato expansion into southern afghanistan brigadier general fraser commanded the multi national brigade and 
 personally oversaw the transition from the us led operation enduring freedom to nato command a very complex change of command 
 relationships that was carried out in the face of increasing enemy resistance task force orion the ppcli battle group played 
 an important role defeating a major insurgent offensive that sought to capture helmand and kandahar provinces task force orion also 
 provided protection for the dutch task force as it moved into its area of operations in uruzgan province this deployment 
 was completed without a single casualty another remarkable feat that was due in large part to the planning and preparations 
 undertaken by patricias and the team that supported them none of these accomplishments would have been possible without the support 
 provided on the home front the ppcli association made a valuable contribution collecting almost 20 000 dollars through operation small 
 pack to provide amenities and support to wounded soldiers this programme was so successful that the canadian forces adopted the 
 programme and committed to providing this support for all soldiers serving in afghanistan the association built on this success by 
 expanding the voluntary patricia programme a national support programme that is committed to providing support to serving and retired patricias 
 who need assistance the regiment paid a significant price for these achievements i was deeply moved as twenty brave patricias 
 lost their lives in afghanistan and many more were wounded the regiment s sacrifices were not confined to afghanistan sadly 
 major hess yon kreudener lost his life on 25 july 2006 while he was serving with the united nations in 
 lebanon while each of these deaths was a tragedy i believe that the experience strengthened the regimental family i was 
 inspired by the motivation focus and commitment of the soldiers who are working so hard to overcome their injuries and 
 return to work i was also heartened by conversations with the families of the fallen their quiet dignity and unshakeable 
 dedication were truly remarkable the highlight of my year was my visit to canada in august and september my granddaughter 
 ella dv breuil accompanied me and we both thoroughly enjoyed our trip i was pleased to finally have the opportunity 
 to visit the second battalion and their families in their new barracks in shilo i was also very happy and 
 relieved to welcome home the first battalion and the rest of the task force orion team i was honoured to 
 preside over the change of appointment ceremony as major general robert stewart handed over his duties as colonel of the 
 regiment to his long time friend and colleague brigadier general larry gollner major general stewart made a significant contribution to 
 the regiment through his outstanding personal example his dedication and sage advice brigadier general gollner is the ninth colonel of 
 the regiment whom i have had the pleasure to serve with i was sad to bid farewell to my old 
 friend major general stewart but i was pleased to have the opportunity to work with another old friend i am 
 sure that brigadier general gollner will continue to build on the success of his predecessors as he helps the regiment 
 face the changes and challenges it will face in the years ahead lam extremely proud of the regiment s accomplishments 
 over the past year it is clear that the regiment is upholding its fine traditions of leadership teamwork bravery service 
 and sacrifice i wish all of my patricias the best of luck for the coming year my thoughts will remain 
 with the patricias serving overseas and the family and friends waiting for them to return safely to canada 
 the patrician 2006 2 colonel of the regiment last august i was honoured by being appointed colonel of the regiment 
 the announcement came almost to the day that fifty years prior i joined our regiment our colonel in chief oversaw 
 mgen r i stewart and my handover mgen stewart and i have served in the regiment together for fifty years 
 as soldiers junior ncos junior officers commanding officers etc mgen stewart is a great soldier he is also a true 
 friend of our regiment and all that know him our regiment had a great year in 2006 our soldiers won 
 numerous gallantry decorations awards and accolades for their courage conduct and tactical skill on the battlefields in afghanistan and elsewhere 
 unfortunately the cost to our regiment and its soldiers was high in terms of those killed and wounded in action 
 as i prepare this report our soldiers continue to carry our name into action in afghanistan c company of the 
 3rd battalion is currently serving with the 2rcr battlegroup a company of 2nd battalion returned home recently having greatly distinguished 
 themselves as a component of the ircr battlegroup lcol eyre co 3rd battalion is also in afghanistan commanding the canadian 
 omlt with the afghan national army meanwhile our 2nd battalion battlegroup has formed up and is actively preparing for deployment 
 in early 2008 2nd battalion s battlegroup will include a rifle company from each of ist and 3rd battalions as 
 well as the provincial reconstruction team from ist battalion and soldiers of the loyal edmonton regiment our association has been 
 front and centre in supporting the regiment as we again began active combat operations soldiers of the association actively supported 
 our serving soldiers by launching operation small pack in early 2006 the association has also assisted wherever possible through its 
 voluntary patricia programme the soldiers and or their families of those that fell or were wounded in afghanistan all the 
 while our association continues to assist veterans from previous campaigns several of the initiatives launched by our association to aid 
 our soldiers have now been adopted nationally by the canadian forces the regimental guard following advice from lady patricia and 
 her desire to retire sought to find a canadian lady as our new colonel in chief after consultation and deliberation 
 the guard agreed that the regiment should approach the right honourable adrienne clarkson pc cc cmm com cd to ask 
 if she would serve with us as our colonel in chief madame clarkson responded positively and enthusiastically the former governor 
 general of canada and commander in chief of the canadian forces madame clarkson is very well known to all ranks 
 of the regiment as governor general she awarded unit commendations to two of our battalions and visited all of our 
 units madame clarkson also has a family tie to the regimental family through her husband john ralston saul whose father 
 served with us having gained her agreement the regiment began the process of gaining authority to change our colonel in 
 chief our selecting a canadian as our future colonel in chief was precedent setting previously all such appointments had been 
 royal appointment in mid november we learned that her majesty the queen had approved lady patricia s retiring and shortly 
 thereafter we gained approval of madame clarkson s appointment at the begining of february her appointment was made public our 
 soldiers continued to serve in the field in afghanistan and other areas of tension world wide all the while routine 
 regimental work continued in 2006 we saw our career management system and process completely revitalized now from top to bottom 
 every leader in the regiment performance is reviewed annually this review is done in strict accord with army personnel planning 
 criteria our regional representational system has also been realigned and reinforced to ensure that soldiers employed away from our units 
 will not be overlooked both the bgen walter semianiw and colonel craig king performed yeoman service to us all by 
 undertaking these critically important personnel initiatives this coming labour day weekend our association will celebrate its 60th anniversary in calgary 
 this anniversary marks 60th years of steadfast service to our extended regimental family earlier i mentioned the strong support the 
 association has and is providing to all of our soldiers through the volunteer patricia programme operation small pack and the 
 hamilton gault memorial fund our association is a vibrant and vital part of our regimental family if at all possible 
 plan to attend our association s 60th in closing it is my belief that our regiment is in fine form 
 the calibre of our soldiers starting with our youngest is truly impressive we continue to meet demanding operational tasks while 
 at the same time watching over our wounded comrades and our extended regimental family we can go forward in confidence 
 with our new colonel in chief in place 
 3 the patrician 2006 regimental headquarters staff message from the regimental major major e a liebert cd this is my 
 first message as the editor of the patrician i am deeply honoured to have been selected to serve as the 
 regimental major i want to thank major ted giraldeau for his hard work his support and advice regimental headquarters is 
 a very interesting and demanding place to work there is much more to do than i imagined when i accepted 
 the job and began my handover i am extremely privileged to have an opportunity to serve the regiment in this 
 capacity and want to thank everyone for the support i have received since i assumed my duties in october the 
 theme of this year s edition of the patrician is the regiment at war a formal acknowledgement of the regiment 
 s ongoing commitment to international peace and security the past year was extremely busy and eventful all of the regiment 
 s battalions the loyal edmonton regiment and e company lord strathcona s horse royal canadians supported operations in afghanistan as 
 this edition of the patrician goes to print the regiment remains heavily committed in afghanistan c company 3 ppcli is 
 deployed with the 2 rcr battle group and lieutenant colonel wayne eyre is commanding the operational military liaison team omlt 
 in kandahar lieutenant colonel dan drew is busy training another omlt based on 3 ppcli and the 2 ppcli battle 
 group has begun to prepare for its deployment in 2008 the regiment s service was not limited to afghanistan patricias 
 continue to serve elsewhere in the world with the nato and united nations regretably we were reminded of the dangers 
 inherent in overseas service when major paeta hess von kruedener was killed as he served as a united nations military 
 observer in southern lebanon the regiment s sacrifices and the demands of afghanistan have focused our efforts and strengthened the 
 regimental family the unit rear parties worked hard to address the needs of the families left behind sadly the regiment 
 was forced to deal with tragedy and increasing numbers of wounded soldiers returning from overseas operations across canada patricias acknowledged 
 the sacrifices made overseas volunteered their time and did what they could to help deal with these demands the ppcli 
 association actively supported soldiers serving overseas most notably with operation small pack a project to provide wounded soldiers with amenities 
 as they are evacuated back to canada this project was so successful that it served as the basis for a 
 new canadian forces initiative that applies to all canadian soldiers who are wounded in afghanistan the remaining funds are being 
 used to support wounded soldiers who are working hard to deal with their injuries the ppcli association continues to support 
 operations through the volunteer patricia program a national support program designed to provide assistance to serving and retired patricias across 
 canada patricias continue to play a leading role in canadian forces schools and training institutions a role that will be 
 reinforced as officers ncos and soldiers returning from overseas service are posted to positions in the training system so that 
 others can benefit from the lessons learned on operations patricias in st jean wainwright and gagetown are working hard to 
 train the nation s soldiers and combat leaders the importance of this work was recognized when prime minister stephen harper 
 took time away from his busy schedule to attend a graduation ceremony at the land forces western area trainging centre 
 in wainwright on 13 april 2006 i will conclude my remarks by acknowledging the retirement of two members of the 
 regimental headquarters staff corporal jeffory hudson finished his military service as the regimental headquarters clerk after serving 14 years with 
 the regiment including overseas deployments to croatia and kosovo he took his release to pursue a new career in the 
 oil industry lynn bullock resigned after serving as the ppcli museum curator for almost ten years to pursue other interests 
 on behalf of the regiment i want to thank jeff and lynn for their service and wish them both all 
 the best in their future endeavours

 2 nc battalions of the royal canadian regiment the rcr on their deployments as a result of that in my 
 present appointment as the land force central area sergeant major i have had the opportunity to visit these companies while 
 training and on deployment in theatre i have witnessed their outstanding performance and have received countless reports of the professionalism 
 of the patricia soldiers we can all be proud of the ppcli s efforts to rebuild afghanistan and defeat the 
 enemy a milestone for the regiment 2007 we will commence a new era in the ppcli as a successor has 
 been appointed to our colonel in chief cmc of the regiment the countess mountbatten of burma her excellency the former 
 governor general of canada madame adrienne clarkson will assume the role only the third cmc in the 93 year history 
 of the ppcli we all know what a great bond madame clarkson has formed with the ppcli and we look 
 forward to welcoming her on future visits to her regiment this evolution in the regimental history is of particular significance 
 to a handful of presently serving rsms as we can lay claim to having served actively under all three cinc 
 all of us in the regiment have many fond memories of our cinc s visits throughout the years and we 
 appreciate the support she has given us leadership i would not be worthy as a rsm if i did not 
 take this opportunity to talk about leadership we have realized in the canadian forces that leadership is all inclusive and 
 have therefore produced one set of keystone doctrine and leadership manuals for all leaders as opposed to the past one 
 book for officers and another for ncos leading people incorporates the tried and true military principles of leadership and the 
 contemporary concepts of the military leadership it sets out the framework for training our junior officers and junior ncos as 
 well as the guidance for responsible leadership of our people for all rank levels training and education gives soldiers ncos 
 and officers the skills and competencies to ready you for the full spectrum of operations but it is leadership that 
 provides the ability to win often maintenance and hygiene time will conflict with rest and morale but if your weapons 
 won t fire or your troops are left out of battle due to illness or infection your mission will not 
 succeed this is the delicate balance between a popular nco or officer and an effective leader the second manual leading 
 the institution provides mentorship for warrant officers senior officers flag and general officers to lead their units formations and commands 
 this new doctrine and set of manuals will provide the foundation for leadership for the canadian forces and the army 
 learn it and live it 
 the patrician 2006 16 senior rsm duty with honour no person has ever been honoured for what he received honour 
 is the reward for what a person has given her excellency the right honourable adrienne clarkson in the past the 
 dishonourable actions of the few have reflected on the whole of the canadian military i need only remind you of 
 somalia a successful mission disgraced in the minds of canadians because of the actions of a few shortly thereafter followed 
 the demise of the airborne regiment as a result of a flood of videos depicting hazing rituals our conduct within 
 the profession of arms must adhere to the values of canadians and uphold the canadian military ethos training for the 
 full spectrum of operations must be harsh and test our abilities to the limits but abuse of subordinates peers opposing 
 force or even once in operations enemy forces steps outside these limits in operations especially combat there is not always 
 time to step back and evaluate if your actions in such a hectic or ruthless environment are ethical that is 
 why ethics as with our other combat skills must be instinctive leaders must incorporate duty with honour the profession of 
 arms in canada as part of their continued training for their troops the duty with honour manual describes the philosophy 
 and practice of ethical service within the cf and the army all leaders must study this manual as part of 
 their warrior spirit and their fighting skills there is a condensed version of the manual and a dvd to assist 
 in training and informing subordinates in this media inundated world failure to act ethically will result in disgrace and failure 
 of the mission as our actions are broadcasted immediately for the world to see and judge you ve seen this 
 happen before unethical actions can do more damage than the enemy can inflict think about it transformation the canadian forces 
 cf has recognized a need for change in this new environment and as a result we are involved in a 
 process of transformation the peculiar thing about transformation is that the business of war fighting and combat service support in 
 the battle space really isn t changed by it the things that affect the battle space are our tactics technology 
 climate terrain and of course the enemy s tactics weapons equipment and cunning what transformation is doing is making the 
 cf and department of national defence dnd more operationally focused in support of operations and less about bureaucracy the new 
 commands are solely committed to forces deployed on operations both expeditionary and domestic and are linked to all agencies supporting 
 the commanders in the field the results are rapid from changes to high readiness training in reaction to lessons learned 
 or the procurement of new weapons and equipment in the space of months even weeks which was unheard of in 
 previous eras so fear not cf transformation is a good thing support on the home front those of you whose 
 primary responsibility is taking care of the families of deployed troops are doing an excellent job and i commend you 
 as well many of you within the regiment in the battalions extra regimentally employed ere posting across the land and 
 members of the ppcli association through your phone calls and visits are taking the time to keep these folks connected 
 to the military community maintain this outreach to the spouses children and parents of those deployed it is an important 
 part of winning the campaign this is particularly important for those families who have lost loved ones or are tending 
 to our wounded staying connected to our wounded is another challenge and one that i believe we are doing a 
 pretty good job at however we can always improve in fact i was feeling pretty good about my own efforts 
 to get out and visit the wounded soldiers when word got back to me indirectly i quote a patricia soldier 
 convalescing near the toronto area this is great that i m getting so many visitors but why don t they 
 send someone i like or words to that effect the lesson learned for those in the chain of command get 
 out and see your wounded troops but make sure you provide the opportunity and funding to get the friends of 
 these troops out to some of the more distant locations for a visit with their wounded pals the commanders of 
 lfwa and 1 cmbg have done a great job in this respect and i thank you on behalf of the 
 regiment 
 17 the patrician 2006 senior rsm support from the home front many of you are manning the garrisons ere postings 
 training centres and rear parties while patiently waiting your turn to deploy there is sometimes little glory in these jobs 
 but the support you are providing cannot go understated your work is tremendously important to the army s total effort 
 at home and abroad well done to all of you in conclusion i would like to reiterate how proud i 
 am of the entire regiment including the regimental association and those other regiments and branches that serve with us in 
 the all arms team the day to day professionalism displayed by both the ppcli and our comrades in arms is 
 a tribute to your dedication to canada the cf the army and your families as i travel throughout this country 
 i am constantly reminded by canadians how much they respect you and appreciate your sacrifice please continue to soldier on 
 and i will work diligently to represent you your families and our regiment within the infantry corps the army and 
 the canadian forces to both soldiers and families thank you for your service to canada john x mcgregor mmm cd

 29 the patrician 2006 ivp 2006 was a year of challenge and accomplishment punctuated by moments of sorrow for 1 
 ppcli the battalion less b company 1 ppcli but augmented by b company 2 ppcli deployed on operation archer from 
 january to august january saw the soldiers of the battalion return from christmas leave and complete last minute preparations prior 
 to deploying on operation archer the lead elements of 1 ppcli were deployed prior to the end of january to 
 begin the handover with task force gun devil the american unit with responsibility for the kandahar area of operations ao 
 a company and recce platoon were the first to take possession of their equipment and conduct their handovers in earnest 
 with their american counterparts b company 2 ppcli quickly assume responsibility for the area around kandahar city lack of equipment 
 delayed c company s deployment to the field but they followed soon after almost immediately activity seemed to heat up 
 across the kandahar province a company was the target of several improvised explosive device led attacks early on in a 
 pattern that would continue to challenge the red devils throughout their deployment c company joined the fray when 7 platoon 
 the divisional quick reaction force qrf fought to defend firebase robinson in helmand province b company 2 ppcli became engaged 
 in several battles in the green space west of kandahar city places like zhari and panjwaii which would become familiar 
 to all canadians very early in the tour throughout the tour there were many memorable combat engagements some of the 
 larger ones were the break in to sangin in support of british 3rd parachute regiment the recapture of nawzad and 
 the sweep of panjwaii on 3 august many firefights occurred while conducting operations in support of other coalition nations nonetheless 
 it is important to remember that for every firefight or battle there were countless hours spent conducting vehicle and foot 
 patrols key leader engagements and village medical outreach clinics these items were truly the desired focus of the battalion within 
 the development diplomacy and defence approach despite the fact that the requirement for security as a precondition often trumped the 
 other elements during the deployment the battalion was well served by the rear party who provided outstanding support to the 
 families left behind their task was very challenging due to the losses that were sustained during the operation b company 
 1 ppcli did not rest on its laurels but completed significant work up training for task force 2 07 unfortunately 
 the mission did not materialize for the task force however all of their work will not be for naught as 
 they are scheduled to deploy on task force 1 08 august september and october were months of great upheaval for 
 the members of 1 ppcli soldiers redeployed to canada prior to disembarkation leave a medals parade and change of command 
 were held notably most of the families of the fallen and soldiers who had been evacuated from theatre due to 
 injuries were present command of 1 ppcli was transferred from lcol lan hope to lcol david anderson 
 the patrician 2006 30 ivp upon return to work there was a major reorganization as many soldiers were posted out 
 or transitioned to more senior positions in addition the battalion ran numerous courses to help regenerate itself in october members 
 of 1 ppcli travelled to shilo where they presented the regimental cypher to a battery 1 rcha the honour came 
 in recognition of the close ties that were formed on operation archer during which a battery fired numerous missions and 
 controlled numerous close air support sorties in support of 1 ppcli remembrance day had special significance for all the soldiers 
 of the battalion this year members fanned out to the hometowns of all the fallen from gibsons b c on 
 the west coast to truro nova scotia on the east coast almost in the blink of an eye the christmas 
 season was upon us and the rsm was suitably pleased to relinquish his half of the horse to the officers 
 this year although deployment on operation archer was very rewarding there was great sorrow at the loss of members of 
 the 1 ppcli battle group despite the sorrow there is great pride in the accomplishment and the sacrifice of those 
 who have fallen in service to their country they will be remembered 1 1 ds a x 4v the city 
 of leduc 
 31 the patrician 2006 ivp a company 1 ppcli 2006 was an exciting year for the red devils in late 
 january a company bid farewell to family and friends prior to deploying to afghanistan as part of operation archer by 
 mid february we were all on the ground in kandahar province after a few short days to get ourselves sorted 
 out the company was quickly launched on operations we relieved the americans known as task force gun devil by assuming 
 control of the gumbad platoon house this compound located in a small village approximately 80 km north of kandahar would 
 come to be known as the red devil inn to the platoons that would cycle through it in three week 
 rotations in early march work began on forward operating base fob martello with another platoon providing security and patrolling the 
 outlying hills upon completion in june fob martello became home to most of the company 
 the patrician 2006 32 ivp throughout the tour the red devils participated in numerous operations including operation sola kowel through 
 the mountains of northern kandahar province and operation mountain thrust which included combat operations through the panjawai area and helmand 
 province by the end of the tour the company which had a platoon attached to the provincial reconstruction team out 
 of downtown kandahar was able to maintain a presence in an offensive operation all the while sustaining fob martello despite 
 heavy vehicle attrition due to improvised explosive devices ieds and several firefights the company was fortunate enough not to lose 
 any soldiers unrelenting in their tasks the red devils performed in the best traditions of the regiment august brought us 
 home to family friends and some much deserved leave we returned to work in the fall to a new commanding 
 officer and new challenges as the company ran junior leadership courses and completed the reorganization while many red devils were 
 posted remembrance day and christmas remained events where most of the company could reunite and recount their accomplishments and experiences 
 with their brothers in arms regardless of the challenges laid out for the company we achieved every one of them 
 through the hard work of our soldiers in afghanistan the locals learned to trust and respect the red devils while 
 the taliban learned that we do in fact rule the ground as our motto dictates most importantly for the red 
 devils they all came home to their loved ones ready to once agair take the fight to any enemy i 
 ex coelis airborne support our troops 
 33 the patrician 2006 ivp b company 1 ppcli 2006 saw b company taking on a variety of unique training 
 opportunities in march the company was attached to 3 ppcli as part of task force 2 07 although a tour 
 did not materialize b company conducted several exercises with the light fighters in may the company deployed to cfb suffield 
 for the range portion of a lav crew commander gunner course followed by mechanized ranges up to platoon level in 
 june b company deployed to hinton alberta along with 3 ppcli to conduct exercise mountain warrior a dismounted patrolling exercise 
 in the foothills of the rocky mountains idyllic visions of clear mountain streams surrounded by majestic peaks were rapidly shattered 
 by the rainy swampy reality of it all in less than ideal conditions b company persevered to conduct reconnaissance and 
 fighting patrols at the section platoon and company level the exercise culminated with a helicopter insertion to conduct a company 
 level raid on an enemy training camp following a chilly night in the woods surrounding the objective b company announced 
 its presence through the simultaneous eruption of three c 6 and four c 9 as the firebase initiated the assault 
 with the objective cleared the company awaited the brief helicopter extraction only to be informed that due to enemy activity 
 an alternate site had been selected thus began a 30 kilometre section level escape and evasion exercise that saw b 
 company as the only sub unit to reach the river crossing site and the pickup zone 
 the patrician 2006 34 ivp in september the company deployed to cfb shilo to conduct more mechanized training this concluded 
 with platoon attacks on an enemy compound surrounded by bunkers and an eight foot high wall from shilo b company 
 deployed directly to wainwright to support b squadron ldsh rc work up training prior to their historic deployment to afghanistan 
 training at the section tank and platoon troop level laid the basis foi the culmination of the exercise in a 
 spectacular combat team attack on an enemy held village including artillery and fast air support the company returned to the 
 battlefields of wainwright in october to conduct a similar exercise with a squadron ldsh rc b company closed out the 
 year in a flurry of courses with soldiers loaded on lav crew commander turret operator ipswq and plq boston pizza 
 edmonton area 
 35 the patrician 200 ivp c company 1 ppcli c company began the year with final preparations for deployment to 
 afghanistan on operation archer rotation 1 the first elements of the company deployed in mid january and by the first 
 week of february the entire company was on the ground in kandahar the first few weeks of the tour were 
 fairly slow for c company with not enough vehicle or equipment available for the company to deploy that did not 
 last long though and the soldiers quickly made up for those first slow weeks without an area of operations for 
 the majority of the tour c company found themselves being sent anywhere and everywhere to assist where it was most 
 needed as well as conducting several operations of its own for march the company was split up with 7 platoon 
 tasked as the divisional quick reaction force qrf and 8 and 9 platoons remaining as c company proper with company 
 headquarters while on qrf 7 platoon had the company s first troops in contact tic after deploying to helmand province 
 to aid in the defence of an american forward operating base fob very shortly after that the remainder of the 
 company went to helmand province to conduct operations and with the end of 7 platoon s qrf task the company 
 was reunited the following few months continued at a furious pace with operations and intense fighting in the 
 36 the patrician 2006 ivp panjwaii area as well as areas around fob martello and gumbad july was expected to 
 bring some routine and stability to the company s operations when c company took over the fob in spin boldak 
 and the associated area of operation ao this would not be the case as 7 platoon was again tasked with 
 divisional qrf and 8 platoon was pulled away for the bulk of the month to conduct operations in panjwaii as 
 well as helmand province this time with the british that left 9 platoon to control the company s ao in 
 spin boldak after a lot of difficult fighting 8 platoon returned to spin boldak near the end of july to 
 trade tasks with 9 platoon following more intense fighting 9 platoon rejoined 8 platoon in spin boldak in early august 
 meanwhile 7 platoon completed their qrf task and were sent to helmand province for a final operation with the british 
 just prior to deploying back to canada the entire company reunited for two days in spin boldak by the time 
 c company left afghanistan we had suffered seven killed in action kia as well as many more wounded but had 
 inflicted many times that number of casualties on the enemy following disembarkation leave c company s next big event was 
 remembrance day in which volunteers were sent to the interment places of each of our fallen that included people travelling 
 to gibsons 8 c thunder bay on truro ns ottawa on sherwood park ab and newfoundland with the conclusion of 
 remembrance day activities c company began training and rebuilding for the future this included running a primary leadership qualification plq 
 course staffing a basic infantry qualification biq course with the majority of its troops participating as candidates on the plq 
 or platoon support weapons qualification pswq course as well select individuals were tasked with travelling to other parts of canada 
 and other nations to impart the lessons we learned during our tour with the end of 2006 c company now 
 sets its sights on the year to come with a new generation of leaders preparing to take charge and the 
 company set to deploy to the arctic on a sovereignty operation sovop in early 2007 it should be another eventful 
 and memorable year for c company 
 37 the patrician 2006 ivp combat support company 1 ppcl 2006 was an extremely busy and exciting year for combat 
 support company with a deployment to afghanistan as part of operation archer rotation 1 combat support company conducted a wide 
 spectrum of operations while deployed in theatre recce platoon arrived in kandahar in february and assumed control of the mianishin 
 area of responsibility aor situated north east of forward operating base fob martello the platoon conducted numerous dismounted and mounted 
 patrols throughout the mountainous area shortly after the handover mianishin became a company s aor and recce platoon was tasked 
 to operate throughout the entire canadian area of operations ao during this time the platoon conducted a variety of operations 
 and convoy escort tasks recce platoon was involved in numerous tics troops in contact incident while conducting operations often the 
 first to deploy into enemy territory the platoon operated in areas such a gumbad panjwayi and helmand province recce platoon 
 redeployed from theatre with all of its soldiers having gained a great deal of combat experience signal platoon was gainfully 
 employed throughout operation archer rotation 1 the platoon coordinated and maintained all of the task force s communications equipment including 
 some that was new to the canadian forces cf inventory as soon as any nonserviceable 0:non 0:serviceable radio equipment was 
 identified members of the platoon conducted immediate troubleshooting and repair additionally the platoon tasked soldiers to operate out of call 
 sign zero c s 0 they helped keep c s 0 running which was essential to providing the task force 
 
 the patrician 2006 38 ivp with immediate support including fast air fire missions and casuality evacuation casevac members of the 
 platoon routinely deployed on convoy escorts and set up command posts cps in the field when required they provided consistently 
 good communications to the battle group bg which was a difficult task as it was often dispersed over great distances 
 the snipers of 1 ppcli were very busy overseas as well they had many opportunities to train and conduct operations 
 with other coalition forces as a highly skilled resource the snipers were in high demand during operation archer rotation 1 
 there was no doubt that their marksmanship principles were applied successfully while conducting combat operations in afghanistan after a brief 
 stop in cyprus combat support company returned from afghanistan and began its much deserved post deployment leave afterwards the company 
 participated in a primary combat function pcf cycle and the soldiers conducted numerous taskings for remembrance day and to share 
 their afghanistan experiences with others across canada the snipers participated in a number of competitions including the canadian international sniper 
 concentration and the canadian national sniper concentration in gagetown nb as well as the us army sniper competition in fort 
 benning georgia combat support company eagerly took jpart in the battalion s christmas activities and the soldiers look forward to

 39 the patrician 2006 ivp administration company 1 ppcli the past year was a year of upheaval challenge and regeneration 
 for administration company although the battalion has been on numerous deployments in the past this was a unique year for 
 the structure of the company in order to support the deployment of the 1 ppcli battle group administration company became 
 a core of the national support element nse the nse was composed of personnel from across 1 canadian mechanized brigade 
 group 1 cmbg and was stood up as an official unit on 6 september 2005 the bulk of maintenance platoon 
 more than half of quartermaster platoon and virtually the entire signal and transport platoons were cut over to form the 
 basis for the nse which was commanded by 1 service battalion with the majority of the company away on tour 
 those left behind became the basis for the 1 ppcli rear party and being rear party meant that they were 
 very busy supporting the remainder of the battalion and also supporting the families of those deployed one thing that never 
 stopped battalion deployed or not was duties all rear party soldiers spent their fair share and sometimes more on duty 
 another thing that never stopped were requests from the brigade who exhausted every available asset they could to support the 
 remainder of 1 cmbg on the ground maintenance platoon was headed by mcpl marcus thompson a former patricia who saw 
 the light an oncoming train and remustered to vehicle technician while the rest of maintenance platoon was deployed he was 
 the acting maintenance officer etqms production warrant officer mechanic and welder a supply technician with a befitting name assisted greatly 
 throughout mcpl binns a bin rat proved to be an integral part of maintenance platoon just don t let the 
 loggies know that a supply guy ran maintenance platoon when mcp thompson wasn t around the quartermaster shop ran on 
 a skeleton crew and i don t mean pte arnold s frame the technical quarter master sergeant major sgt bate 
 no s who has quite possibly the best gelled hair in the battalion had an assortment of guys and gals 
 working for him and was challenged by brigade requests as well despite being busy cpl gonzales moser g m was 
 like speedy gonzales and did very well in the annual mountain man competition transport platoon was run ragged keeping the 
 rear party mobile lack of qualifications is a constant thorn in the side to those trying to plan support so 
 soldiers who were qualified on several vehicles like cpl lafleur found they were in great demand perhaps the biggest challenge 
 and yet the most honourable was fleshing out the ranks for the unfortunately large numbers of funeral parties that were 
 required throughout these tasks the administration company soldiers were well turned out and did the battalion and the families of 
 their fallen comrades proud once the battalion returned to work in october and the change of command was over it 
 was time for administration company to be regenerated but with a twist given the exodus of battalion leadership that was 
 on tour combat support company found itself without an officer commanding second in command company sergeant major and perhaps most 
 importantly a clerk depending on whom you talk to combat support elements were either assimilated into a beefed up administration 
 company or the latter joined combat support in an amalgamated 250 person headquarters company under the watchful eyes of major 
 boyuk and wos turner and dandrade on morning parades we dwarf the other companies speaking of parades we are now 
 forming up on the far right hmm doesn t that make us administration company the right of line that has 
 got to be a first yes 2006 was an unusual year in the life of the company the company was 
 taken apart put in suspended animation then reborn stronger and bigger than ever the entire company is looking forward to 
 the challenges and good times inevitably associated with supporting the combat team commanders course and training of task force 1

 43 the patrician 2006 originals by colonel r s peacock cd ret d the origin of these articles on past 
 patricias came from my studies on the problems arising from the lack of reinforcements for the regiment in france belgium 
 in early 1915 the need for a detailed search to verify the problem was confirmed in my mind at least 
 by reviewing the correspondence between the patricias and the canadian contingent in england in the period november december 1914 it 
 was apparent that the reinforcement problem was approaching crisis proportions as early as late november with the patricias asking for 
 and being assigned over two hundred men from newly arrived units of the cef why if the patricias were at 
 full war establishment with surplus to meet normal wastage rates did the regiment require so early an infusion of men 
 to be at full strength to go to france in december 1914 the answer was the same for the patricias 
 as for all the units in the cef the unsuitability of personnel medical problems desertion awol and the first call 
 by the british army on reservists who had emigrated to canada this is the legacy of too rapid a mobilization 
 and too careless a selection screening system in the regimental history by ralph hodder williams volume 2 page 64 there 
 is a short outline of the cef units that supplied reinforcements to the patricias throughout the war i was only 
 interested in the earliest drafts there were over four hundred men sent from the 12 tn 23 rd 28 tn 
 30 tn and 32nd bns cef in a series of drafts starting in january 1915 and ending in june 1915 
 there are smaller groups from the 25 tn 27 tn and 31 st bns and from a group called ppcli 
 reinforcements the casualty rates from enemy action and loss from illness from the conditions in the trenches had been much 
 higher than anyone had planned for in the euphoria of raising an army in canada i decided to do a 
 detailed review of all the personnel from the reinforcing battalions and see who they were where they came from their 
 war records and were they any different than the originals that were attested in ottawa in august 1914 this review 
 was done using volume 2 and visiting ottawa and drawing the individual personnel files from the national archives in doing 
 this it became obvious that there was little difference in the quality of the men their prior military experience or 
 their countries of origin out of this group came the future leaders of the regiment at all levels having commanded 
 many platoons and companies as well as a battalion in my service i developed an affinity with these men as 
 individuals with whom i could identify i felt that i should share some of their stories with our readers as 
 i continue to probe the facts of our shared history whether or not this will develop into a book or 
 learned paper is too early to decide but in the meantime join with me in seeing these men as soldiers 
 you will understand and recognize 51259 lieutenant arthur norrie bisset mortimer mc mortimer was one of a wave of recent 
 immigrants to canada who arrived from the united kingdom in the decade before 1914 he was twenty four years of 
 age and came from edinburgh scotland mortimer was working as a salesman in calgary at the outbreak of world war 
 one was living in the area of 17 tn avenue east he had been born in edinburgh on the 3 
 rd of june 1890 to a close knit family and his father designated as his next of kin was still 
 in scotland mortimer s only previous military experience had been with the territorials in scotland a few years earlier our 
 budding recruit was attested in calgary on the 3 rd of november 1914 and declared himself single and willing to 
 serve his majesty king george v until the end of hostilities mortimer was unusual for the times in that he 
 was 6 tall with a 40 chest and an athletic physique he is recorded as being handsome having a dark 
 complexion and blue eyes at 24 years 5 months of age he would have been a prime candidate his general 
 level of formal education was above that of the normal recruit of the day and his time in canada showed 
 he was an opportunist and not afraid to work hard and take risks he demonstrated that he would be a 
 success at whatever career he chose he was quickly despatched to join the 23 rd battalion cef in valcartier quebec 
 where he passed the medical examination with flying colours the 23 rd bn was immediately shipped to england to begin 
 training and wait for the formation of the 2 nd canadian division events in flanders quickly changed this planning as 
 enemy action illness and personnel unsuitability caused unforeseen extremely high rates of wastage in the field in the ist1 st 
 canadian 
 the patrician 2006 44 originals by colonel r s peacock cd ret d division and with the ppcli the patricias 
 alone needed over four hundred replacements during february and march 1915 to keep rifle company strengths at fighting levels the 
 recently arrived battalions from canada were tasked to provide immediate reinforcements private mortimer was a member of a draft of 
 reinforcements from the 238 n cef consisting of two officers and 110 ncos and men who joined the ppcli in 
 the field in belgium during mid and late february 1915 the founder and senior major hamilton gault would have been 
 impressed with the quality of manpower that which arrived to reinforce the patricias and mortimer was seen as an obvious 
 future nco the draft that arrived on 22 nd february 1915 was quickly involved in the fighting in the st 
 eloi salient where mortimer quickly learned the ropes of soldiering he went unscathed until the btn8 tn of may in 
 the battle of frezenberg when he was wounded with shrapnel in his left shoulder and arm after his evacuation from 
 flanders mortimer ended up in the london general hospital at chelsea where his treatment continued his wounds were not life 
 threatening and his recovery was rapid and was granted a week of furlough in mid june 1915 he took this 
 opportunity to get go north to edinburgh and visit his parents on return to chelsea he was transferred to shorncliffe 
 military hospital where he had a run in with a staff warrant officer and was charged with conduct to the 
 prejudice of good order and discipline for insolence our hero did not suffer fools meekly for his sins he received 
 a severe reprimand and some curtailment of local hospital privileges mortimer continued his rehabilitation and was returned to the ppcli 
 in france in september 1915 he became an acting corporal and served through the battle of the somme unharmed his 
 rank was confirmed on 12 november 1916 while he was taking officer training at the ghq cadet school corporal mortimer 
 became lieutenant mortimer on the 22 nd december just in time for christmas 1916 during january 1917 the patricias went 
 into action around the area of la folie with mortimer as a platoon commander it was during the patricias tenth 
 rotation into the line that action intensified mortimer with a patrol of five men was tasked to rush the enemy 
 at birken crater and destroy an enemy dugout two of the men carried a charge of aminol with a 90 
 second fuze the ground was covered with snow and the night was moonless but clear and starry the members of 
 the patrol were outfitted with white clothing and covers for all weapons these were created by the unit tailor from 
 spare canvas and proved to be very successful the patrol got into position as planned and rushed the enemy post 
 where three sentries tried to 
 45 the patrician 2006 originals by colonel r s peacock cd ret d surrender but not before one had thrown 
 a bomb at the patrol lieutenant mortimer and cpl b j stagroom were both wounded in spite of this bad 
 luck the patrol overcame the enemy but in so doing had raised the alarm with the main bavarian garrison lcpl 
 sinclair and pte davies went about setting the aminol explosive charge and covering the withdrawal of the patrol it was 
 unfortunate the charge did not explode as planned and the failure to detonate was later attributed to the freezing weather 
 not a good night for mortimer and stangroom but the patrol was well executed and done with great elan our 
 hero was awarded the military cross for this action mortimer received wounds to his face hand and was temporarily blind 
 in one eye and partially deaf from concussion he was evacuated to england on the hospital ship dieppe on ist1 
 st of february 1917 by chance he was sent to shorncliffe military hospital where he had been charged for insolence 
 two years earlier as a private soldier one wonders if he met up with the warrant officer again this time 
 as a commissioned officer wearing his newly awarded military cross mortimer s wounds were somewhat troubling especially the damage to 
 his vision and the lingering deafness but the wounds were on the whole superficial and his recovery was slow and 
 steady while in hospital he was diagnosed with vincent s angina which was a bad case of trench mouth this 
 common condition affecting so many soldiers from the trenches resulted from poor oral hygiene poor food stress insufficient rest and 
 heavy smoking the effect was usually very painful ulcerated gums and mouth with no antibiotics in use at the time 
 the treatment was by swabbing the throat and mouth with raw alcohol he survived and was granted three weeks furlough 
 to edinburgh these trips home now had a clear goal as arthur mortimer had found the woman of his dreams 
 and returned there at every opportunity after his treatment and convalescence mortimer was taken on strength of the 7 reserve 
 battalion a holding unit for the 7 n brigade in seaford where he took several courses of instruction with weapons 
 and practiced his own techniques of instruction while this was continuing he missed the battles of vimy ridge and passchendaele 
 he rejoined the patricias in the field on the 24 november 1917 to help rebuild the unit after the heavy 
 losses in the battle of passchendaele at this time the canadian corps was held in the north around their old 
 haunts at vimy during the final german offensive in march 1918 there is an entry in mortimer s records of 
 having two weeks training on machine guns at le touquet in the rear area in april 1918 on the 26 
 june 1918 he was granted two weeks leave and once again it was off to edinburgh on return he paraded 
 himself before the commanding officer lieutenant colonel c j t stewart for permission to get married this was quickly approved 
 and his future seemed to be mapped out the great allied counter offensive was launched on the btn8 tn of 
 august 1918 with the patricias in the forefront and included the newly betrothed arthur mortimer his luck continued and he 
 came through all the actions at parvillers jigsaw wood and tilloy without a scratch this was almost miraculous as over 
 eighty percent of regimental officers were casualties during this period in late september 1918 mortimer found himself in command of 
 no 2 company at tilloy after the other company officers were killed or wounded two days before the armistice he 
 was again on leave to edinburgh for fourteen days to get married and prepare his new bride for the trip 
 to canada on his return he was made an acting captain for a short period which must have helped improve 
 the balance in his pay book after the armistice was signed the patricias moved by easy marches toward the english 
 channel from mons through the belgian countryside ending in st leger near the channel coast where they remained for a 
 month waiting for transport to return to england and canada it was at this time that the founder and commanding 
 officer lieutenant colonel hamilton gault decided that the camp colour should be consecrated as the regimental colour on the 28 
 th of january 1919 major the reverend t mccarthy mc chaplain to the regiment conducted the ceremony on a snowy 
 winter field with the members of the regiment formed in hollow square the drums stacked in the centre with the 
 camp colour draped over them lieutenant arthur norrie bisset mortimer mc was selected by the commanding officer to be the 
 subaltern to receive the newly consecrated regimental colour after the ceremony of consecration mortimer trooped the regimental colour along the 
 ranks for all to see the first of a long line of subalterns to be honoured as ensign to the 
 colour 
 the patrician 2006 46 originals by colonel r s peacock cd ret d the patricias returned to england on the 
 stn5 tn of february 1919 to spend a month in the canadian camp at bramshott mortimer was with them but 
 was very occupied with getting his bride to canada he returned to canada on the 23 rcl of april 1919 
 on the ss metagama accompanied by his new bride and was demobilized two weeks later in ottawa mrs isobel mortimer 
 was one of many war brides who were able to accompany their husbands on their return to canada on return 
 to calgary they managed to secure a residence at 508 btn8 tn aye ne as with most veterans of the 
 day arthur mortimer was happy to get on with life and get back to a civilian career he had been 
 an aggressive brave and increasingly competent soldier from his early times as a private at st eloi in 1915 to 
 the end of the war as an officer and acting company commander in the last hundred day s campaign one 
 of the many citizens who answered the call to arms served their country and disappeared from view having only a 
 few lines in the regimental history to record their gallant service 51426 lance corporal stone leonard leonard stone came to 
 my attention in my studies for two reasons first he was wounded four times during the war and secondly he 
 only rose to lance corporal in four years when i first drew and read his file from the national archives 
 i came away with the feeling that stone was the luckiest man in the ppcli and a very reluctant lance 
 corporal as i studied his record of service in more detail i was torn between two images of the man 
 as a soldier first was that he reminded me of private turvey the fictional soldier in earl birney s classic 
 book turvey the subject of the book is an unfortunate but lovable soldier whose travails with the military administrative and 
 medical system in world war 2 were presented with ironic humour by the author the second image was a comparison 
 to private donald fraser as presented in the book the journal of private fraser 1914 1918 that was edited and 
 published by professor reginald h roy of the university of victoria fraser was an educated intelligent and observant soldier who 
 made the conscious decision that he didn t wish to hold any rank nor have responsibility for others his approach 
 was that those who lead others are much more likely to get killed he made it through the war almost 
 to the end before being badly wounded and evacuated fraser received an early discharge and suffered from his wounds for 
 years afterwards his appeals to the canadian pension board in the 1920s are most eloquent and revealing both books are 
 highly recommended leonard stone was born in westbury on tyne bristol england on the 28 tn of february 1884 making 
 him almost thirty one years of age on enlistment in 1914 he was a recent immigrant and had found employment 
 in montreal as a coachman on the street railway system when war broke out he decided to enlist and was 
 recruited into the ppcli reinforcements on the 30 tn october 1914 he was sent immediately to valcartier where he was 
 declared fit for overseas service on the 11 tn of november very quickly he was off to england and a 
 short training period before being sent to the front fortunately he had an opportunity to get home to see his 
 mother and family friends in westbury on tyne over christmas 1914 on a short furlough his previous military experience had 
 been a tour of duty with the 13 tn prince albert s somerset light infantry before arriving in canada leonard 
 stone was 59 with a 39 chest and like most veterans was well tattooed he would need all his previous 
 military training and experience as he was placed on a draft joining the ppcli in belgium on the 28 tn 
 of february 1915 the draft arrived the day after the innovative patricia trench raid on the 27 th he quickly 
 fitted in to the unit and was wounded the first time in the fighting around st eloi on the 11 
 th of april it was a minor wound a grazing wound on the buttock and he was discharged to duty 
 a few days later he was wounded a second time on the 6 tn of may during the battle of 
 frezenberg and was evacuated to a base hospital at wimmereux near boulogne a few days later he was discharged to 
 convalescent duty and promptly went awol savouring the pleasures that were locally available for this heinous crime he received a 
 fine and was confined to camp the old soldier must have had a good story as the fine was cancelled 
 a few weeks later he then returned to the regiment which was rebuilding after the heavy losses at battle of 
 frezenberg all was fairly normal during the remainder of 1915 for leonard stone as he participated in all the regiment 
 s actions early in 1916 he reported to the medical officer with suspected influenza and was evacuated to england there 
 he was diagnosed with enteric fever that 
 the patrician 2006 47 originals by colonel r s peacock cd ret d was later re diagnosed as paratyphoid fever 
 he spent the next seven months in various hospitals light duty furlough and another charge of awol before he was 
 discharged to the 7 th reserve battalion ppcli and rcr depot there he was appointed lance corporal with pay and 
 where he was put on restricted duties and was specifically denied working anywhere that food was being prepared he remained 
 in england until early 1917 when he was returned as a private to the regiment prior to the attack at 
 vimy ridge leonard stone came through the battle unhurt but on the 25 tn of may 1917 he was wounded 
 once again this time by shrapnel in the shoulder and back it was off to hospital in wimmereux once more 
 followed by a period of convalescence on his return to the regiment he was appointed lance corporal with pay in 
 late september a month later during the opening phases of the battle of passchendaele on the 30 tn of october 
 1917 lance corporal stone was wounded for the fourth time this time a flesh wound in the left arm once 
 more he was evacuated finally ending up in england where he was given a series of treatments in four hospitals 
 before being discharged to duty in january 1918 on discharge from hospital he was posted to the 7 tn reserve 
 battalion in salisbury on restricted duties he stayed on their establishment until the end of the war leonard stone chose 
 to be discharged in england and at age thirty five and single he returned to westbury on tyne to be 
 the sole support for his widowed mother wounded at st eloi frezenberg vimy ridge and passchendaele leonard stone was a 
 very lucky soldier all of his combat wounds were non life threatening and he recovered from them with no lasting 
 physical problems the effects of the enteric fever and paratyphoid weakened his body far more than his combat wounds ever 
 did the term debility was used to describe his condition in every medical assessment done in england he comes across 
 to me as a reluctant lance corporal who did not wish the responsibility of leading but did his duty when 
 it was required he served canada and the regiment well and managed to end his war in a degree of 
 comfort and safety 1116 lieutenant arthur charles peacock mc dcm during the trooping of the colour in calgary in june 
 1951 i was assigned as aide to the founder brigadier hamilton gault almost the first question he had for me 
 was concerning my relationship to charles peacock he felt that charlie was a first class soldier and if i as 
 an officer cadet could do as well i would be very good indeed this was warm praise coming from a 
 former commanding officer during our trooping celebrations in germany in 1956 i was again questioned about my relationship by a 
 few of the originals including the feisty major hugh niven all were effusive in their regard for this man in 
 1958 at the trooping in victoria once again i had the honour to be aide to the founder for his 
 last visit to his regiment during this time we visited with lieutenant colonel tenßroeke for tea at a residence on 
 the saanich inlet where i learned much more about this well respected soldier from a man who had fought along 
 side him in battle at the jubilee trooping in 1964 in germany my wife and i had the pleasure of 
 hosting lieutenant colonel a g pearson and his son in our home for dinner the same 
 the patrician 2006 48 originals by colonel r s peacock cd ret d questions and the same comments charles peacock 
 was regarded by all those with whom he served as a fine soldier courageous and professional in his attention to 
 duties his picture taken in early march 1919 shows him consciously covering his disfigured left hand he is wearing the 
 mc and dcm with the 1914 15 star on his recently acquired officer pattern uniform and accoutrements by any standards 
 he was a handsome man and at twenty nine years of age was a most eligible bachelor charlie peacock as 
 he was known in the patricias was born in hemel hempstead hertfordshire england on the 13 tn of january 1890 
 with his two brothers he emigrated to canada in 1912 one brother robert settled in toronto on spadina road the 
 other brother frederick moved farther west and ended up on the island of maui in the territory of hawaii charles 
 secured employment as a policeman in montreal where his stature and bearing would have been a great asset on the 
 outbreak of war he proceeded to ottawa and enlisted in the patricias on the 25 tn of august 1914 he 
 was six foot tall with a 38 chest sandy hair and blue eyes and in good physical condition with an 
 aura of confident leadership he soon left for england and then went to france with the regiment on the 20 
 tn of december 1914 his only previous military experience had been six years with the royal garrison artillery territorials in 
 england now he was in the st eloi salient and where he learned his infantry skills very well on the 
 27 n of february 1915 he participated in the initial trench raid that was to become a pattern for canadian 
 units during the raid he was wounded in the right shoulder and was evacuated after a few weeks in hospital 
 and convalescence he returned to the unit on the 15 tn of april in time to take part in the 
 actions at polygon wood in this action charles peacock was part of the screening force keeping up heavy rifle fire 
 while the unit fell back to the new line on the frezenberg ridge sensing this movement the germans pushed hard 
 and overran the outpost line charles peacock and two others had to escape capture by moving to the west and 
 coming back through a british unit as stragglers they went through a rigorous questioning by the military police but the 
 corps commander lieutenant general smith dorien who was in the area took special interest in these canadians who were trying 
 to find their unit he had them returned post haste to where they would fight in the battle of frezenberg 
 charles was immediately promoted corporal with a further promotion to sergeant in september 1915 in february 1916 the effects of 
 two winters in the trenches caught up with charles and he had to report sick with trench fever lumbago rheumatism 
 and influenza all of which were real enough but the primary diagnosis was eventually changed to myalgia his legs were 
 in a state where he was extremely weak could not march had difficulty walking and couldn t sleep for the 
 pain the explanation on the medical report was two winters and fourteen months in france he was evacuated to england 
 and went through a long period of treatment and reconstructive exercises the medical authorities offered to reclassify him as unfit 
 for field service and return him to canada an option that was refused outright charles persisted and eventually he was 
 returned to the regiment arriving in july 1917 after the battle of vimy ridge and was immediately promoted company sergeant 
 major on the 30 tn of october 1917 the regiment was part of the initial attack at passchendaele and from 
 the outset it was bad for n 0 3 company all the officers were quickly killed wounded or disappeared in 
 the bombardment very early in the attack charles was wounded in the face and shoulder but rallied the company to 
 take their objective this done he was wounded a second time with a bullet wound to his left hand he 
 was evacuated through rouen to england and further treatment for this action he was awarded the military cross the citation 
 reads for conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty he went forward in an attack although wounded at the assembly position 
 when all company officers became casualties he led his men forward with great determination until wounded a second time once 
 again the medical authorities felt he should be returned to canada as unfit for active service as his left hand 
 was beyond repair he stubbornly refused and demanded he be graded fit for the field finally an exasperated medical officer 
 wrote does not need to carry a rifle in the rank of csm fit for duty 
 49 the patrician 2006 originals by colonel r s peacock cd ret d he returned to the regiment in april 
 1918 as a csm after a short period as acting rsm it was back to his company and the preparations 
 for the last hundred days push to end the war the almost continuous actions throughout august 1918 were extremely costly 
 to the regiment with over eighty percent of the officers and sixty five percent of ncos becoming casualties this was 
 a campaign that rivals frezenberg sanctuary wood and passchendaele in losses on the 27 tn of august the depleted ranks 
 of his company were given a further task to take a piece of vital ground lieutenant grant with two weak 
 platoons and a few survivors from other companies was assigned the task lieutenant grant was badly wounded and csm peacock 
 took command and pushed through to secure the objective sadly lieutenant grant died of his wounds a few days later 
 charles peacock was awarded the distinguished conduct medal for his exdloits the citation reads when all the platoon officers of 
 his company had become casualties he took command of half the company and urging them on led them to the 
 final objective on reaching the objective he showed great initiative and resource in reorganizing his command and establishing his position 
 he conducted himself with admirable coolness and gallantry strangely this decoration is not included in the list of awards for 
 this action on page 351 of volume 1 of our regimental history on the 6 tn of september 1918 charles 
 peacock was commissioned as a lieutenant and sent on leave to england for proper uniforms and a bit of indoctrination 
 he returned to duty for a short period then had to use the medical services once more because of recurring 
 weakness in his legs and shortness of breath he was evacuated two days before the armistice was signed and was 
 finally graded unfit for field service in 1919 lieutenant peacock returned to canada on the ss carmania in march of 
 1919 and was discharged in ottawa later that month he moved immediately to his selected place of residence in kahalui 
 maui territory of hawaii his brother was of great help getting him settled and charles the civilian took employment with 
 the wailuku sugar company where he quickly rose to the position of superintendant this was challenging job directing a large 
 work force that included filipino portuguese chinese and japanese labourers the social life in kahalui must have suited charles as 
 the maui news reported his engagement to armine yon tempsky on the 23 rd of january 1920 what happened in 
 this relationship is not recorded but charles married marjorie leonard in august 1924 the happy couple had a daughter in 
 march 1928 for whatever reason the family left maui and returned to mainland united states three months after the birth 
 of their daughter on their departure the local newspaper gave his name as archibald charles peacock our hero was last 
 heard of in new jersey in the late 19405 he was a gallant and highly respected soldier who suffered all 
 the trials of war yet kept returning to his regiment to do his duty i regret that i never had 
 the opportunity to meet him it would have been an experience to hear his stories of the regiment 
 50 the patrician 2006 originals by colonel r s peacock cd ret d 22560 private robert leonard james craig the 
 photograph of private craig was taken in a studio in england broughtons of ipswich sometime in november or december 1914 
 and is typical of the personalized souvenir cards sent by soldiers to friends and relatives in canada this particular post 
 card fell out of an old chest of drawers in a farmhouse in eastern ontario in 1994 and the farm 
 owner had no idea from where the photograph had come or the identity of the soldier friends of the owner 
 ex military and former neighbours of ours in ottawa and kingston asked if there was any way of finding information 
 about the soldier s background this was achieved using the resources of the national archives and the regimental history volume 
 2 in the picture we can see a serious young man with a touch of self consciousness and unease at 
 having his photograph taken he is dressed in the early world war one style uniform complete with leather belt puttees 
 12th battlion cef badges and wearing canadian made boots that would not stand the wear and tear of salisbury plain 
 or the trenches of flanders private craig was a typical soldier of the times who served his country well and 
 paid the ultimate price leonard craig was born on 23rd of april 1895 in the parish of st mary s 
 in york county new brunswick nb he was just over 19 years of age when he enlisted immediately after the 
 outbreak of war craig was a lanky teenager 510 tall with a 30 chest and saw this as a chance 
 to see the world and do challenging things the pay as a soldier would be far superior to anything he 
 had had working as a farm labourer and as well he would be fed and clothed his only previous military 
 service had been a year with the 71st york regiment militia in new brunswick craig was sent to valcartier quebec 
 where a new training camp was under construction on the sandy plains by the jacques cartier river about twenty miles 
 north of quebec city as with many others from new brunswick nova scotia and quebec he was put into a 
 numbered battalion the 12th battalion bn canadian expeditionary force cef between the chaos of construction and the numerous parades for 
 the minister of defence major general sam hughes and his many guests not too much relevant training was accomplished craig 
 was medically examined on the 29th of september 1914 and was found fit for overseas service from the administrative frenzy 
 of camp valcartier the 12th bn cef sailed from quebec city on 4th of october 1914 on the s s 
 scotian the ocean crossing was slow crowded and uneventful the unit disembarked at plymouth sound and was sent into the 
 soggy salisbury plain for training and to life in tented accommodation after a month of continuous rain and cold many 
 in the 12th bn came down with influenza and some with meningitis the losses from poor health awol desertion and 
 general unsuitability rose sharply in all units of the ist canadian division and with the ppcli during november and december 
 1914 official correspondence of the period shows clearly that the reinforcement crisis had started in england in this period 
 the patrician 2006 51 originals by colonel r s peacock cd ret d long before problems developed in flanders in 
 february march 1915 the 12th bn was to be kept in the england with the intention of forming a second 
 infantry division as soon as possible but with the increased losses in flanders from enemy action the units in england 
 were tasked to provide immediate reinforcements craig was put on the second reinforcing draft destined for the ppcli and left 
 for the front on the 17th of february 1915 there is some unconfirmed information that he was in the first 
 ppcli trench raid on the 27 28 th of february in any case craig did suffer severely from the conditions 
 in the trenches and was evacuated in march to n 0 2 general hospital in lehavre with severe gastritis after 
 a week of treatment he returned to the unit and the build up to the second battle of ypres the 
 battle commenced on the 22nd of april with the main assault against the ist canadian division and the french when 
 poison gas used for the first time as a weapon of war the german attacks continued for another three weeks 
 across the perimeter of the ypres salient craig fought in all the actions leading up to the battle of frezenberg 
 including the desperate fighting around polygon wood during the main battle on the bth of may he was wounded by 
 shrapnel he received a general service wound gsw in his right leg and was evacuated to a british military hospital 
 in paris plage france on the channel coast and then to england for treatment at no l south general hospital 
 in birmingham his leg wound had become dangerously infected and only after the shrapnel was finally removed did his rehabilitation 
 commence he recovered quickly and was told to take ten days of furlough and then report back to the ppcli 
 in flanders there is no indication of where craig went or what he did during his only furlough after rejoining 
 the ppcli in late july craig took part in every action in 1915 and early 1916 in march 1916 the 
 german campaign to drive the allied forces from the mount kemmel ridge and take the city of ypres commenced for 
 the ppcli these actions culminated in the battle of sanctuary wood in the first week of june where the unit 
 suffered over 400 casualties private leonard craig was killed in action on the 6th of june in the massive artillery 
 bombardment that all but destroyed the forward companies he left a mother mrs john kirch who had moved to willmar 
 saskatchewan while he was overseas his pay book shows a monthly deduction of 25 00 to be paid to his 
 sister jessie still living in zionville nb private leonard craig was eligible for the 1914 15 star in addition to 
 the two standard world war medals in 1922 his mother received his medals and the memorial cross he lies in 
 flanders fields with too many of his comrades as with so many who volunteered to serve he is remembered by 
 a short notation in the regimental history and a grave marker in a foreign field para moustache club 
 the patrician 2006 52 strathcona country proud of my canadian soldier the father and husband that he is asked me 
 if he could go the soldier who knew where he belonged would do so i asked him once please don 
 t go we need you more the look in his eyes shamed me to the core my canadian soldier knew 
 where his duty lay i hide my tears and fear as you proudly walked away i hope and pray that 
 you know how much i care even though there are times my feelings i don t share i have read 
 the news about the accidents and lives lost i pray and hope to god you never have to pay that 
 cost you have missed so much since we have last seen you but as a soldier you knew in your 
 heart what you had to do you have heard some canadians voice their thoughts that this war is wrong knowing 
 this you fought for all canadians it proves just how you are strong this is the first time that canadians 
 soldiers have fought since the korean war the more you achieve your goals the higher your spirits will soar the 
 war you fight for all of us we find it hard to understand but you my canadian soldier will do 
 the best you can as a wife i now have a great fear answering a door or phone but when 
 or if they come knocking my feelings will be known i love you like no other you are my other 
 half i accept our way of life as you lead us down this path you have given up your heart 
 soul and mind my prayer is all canadians will someday know and see you in kind i am not a 
 strong military wife even though i try there are too many times i just want to give up and cry 
 you are so strong you have the strength to show me that by listening and learning from you you have 
 set me free there are never enough words to say thank you you have fought a hard fight and have 
 paid your due we all need to remember every soldier who have fought it was for our freedom safety and 
 future they sought anonymous 
 53 the patrician 2006 2vp in the history of the regiment 2006 will be remembered and recorded as a watershed 
 point in time that embodied the strength of our soldiers and their leaders for the second battalion all one has 
 to do to understand this is note the exceptional work done by our companies on operations overseas as part of 
 task force afghanistan those companies who trained supported and prepared them for their respective deployments those key organizations who provided 
 untiring support to the families at home those members of the entire battalion who performed the vital functions relating to 
 casualty support and all of those involved in returning our fallen comrades to their families with dignity and honour january 
 february the year began with 2 ppcli preparing for the deployment of approximately 150 personnel to operations in afghanistan these 
 were anxious days for the families and were mixed with excited anticipation for the soldiers going out the door for 
 seven and in some cases nine months in addition to bravo company deploying with the 1 ppcli battle group members 
 of 2 ppcli also deployed with the brigade headquarters the nse and the afghan national army training team the deployments 
 began in mid january and were completed by early february b company deploys from winnipeg another first for shilo and 
 indeed the second battalion occurred in mid february when the battalion hosted exercise ric a dam doo because the first 
 battalion was deployed a cunning plan was devised to conduct this junior officer training in the home of 2 ppcli 
 vice edmonton the list of distinguished guests included mgen r i stewart ret d the colonel of the regiment lgen 
 r r crabbe ret d mgen j l sharpe ret d mgen h c pitts ret d bgen g w 
 nordick and col c r king the junior officers from all three battalions were exposed to briefings on topics that 
 are relevant not only to our history but also to current operations involving the regiment additionally the first person accounts 
 of the korean war and operations in croatia in 1993 and operation apollo in 2002 including an excellent presentation by 
 sgt tim mcmeekin formerly of 2 ppcli only served to add to the value of this training all participants were 
 treated to the best that shilo has to offer including an exceptional regimental mess dinner a vibrant officers mess and 
 35c wind chill that delayed the road move back to edmonton when the bus froze march june the next four 
 months were representative of what the battalion would experience throughout the rest of the year the second battalion experiences ranged 
 from field training and preparation for operations to casualty administration there was no member of the second battalion deployed in 
 afghanistan or remaining in shilo that was not effected by the events 
 the patrician 2006 54 2vp and emotions of these four months on 2 march a vehicle accident involving a b 
 company lav 3 in afghanistan ultimately claimed the lives of two of our own corporal paul davis and mcpl tim 
 wilson died as a result of this accident and other soldiers sustained injuries that led to their repatriation back to 
 canada this was a sad period for the entire battalion as this tragedy happened at a time when a company 
 was ramping up its training and focus for deployment in august spending most of early march in the field in 
 shilo on exercise royal patricia on 17 march the second battalion gathered and conducted a memorial service in honour of 
 our fallen comrades in shilo the first of what would prove to be a total of four memorial services included 
 many local provincial and federal dignitaries and military vips the following day a company deployed to petawawa to train with 
 1 rcr on exercise thundering bear ii in preparation for deployment on task force 3 06 of particular note during

 the patrician 2006 56 2vp the summer heat in shilo july september july was dedicated to summer leave and the 
 final training and administrative preparations for a company prior to their deployment for the soldiers of a company and their 
 families this was an exciting anxious and emotional time august began with a company deploying in the first days and 
 the second battalion preparing for the return of b company later in the month what followed was a month full 
 of joy and sadness in the extremes we felt the pride of deploying a fully trained and prepared a company 
 and the excited anticipation of the return of bravo company to their families after seven long months on operations these 
 emotions were tempered with the sorrow and impact of the loss of two of our comrades in service overseas mcpl 
 jeffery walsh and corporal david braun died in august in two separate incidents while on operations west of kandahar memorial 
 services were conducted for both of these fallen soldiers and many members of their families the local community and the

 of 2 ppcli over a two day period at the end of august this was the first time that lady 
 patricia had visited shilo since 2 ppcli moved from winnipeg in the summer of 2004 this visit was noteworthy as 
 it was not only the first visit to shilo but also the first time that lady patricia had been to 
 the second battalion since july 2001 lady patricia visits with families of the wounded on the evening of 31 august 
 2 ppcli hosted a dinner in the officers mess for the colonel in chief and invited guests that included the

 an occasion for specific soldiers to be recognized for promotion and dedicated service as well as those having just returned 
 from 
 57 the patrician 2006 2vp operation archer being presented with their medals by both lady patricia and bgen gollner truly 
 a rare privilege this was also a significant event for the families of the second battalion and many relatives came 
 from great distances to share in this special day for the newer soldiers in the second battalion this was their 
 first chance to meet with our colonel in chief for them it will be an event that they will always 
 remember for those who have had this opportunity in the past the importance and value of such a visit was 
 reinforced the bbq after the parade was a chance for soldiers and their families to sit down and speak one 
 on one with the colonel in chief wives fathers mothers sons and daughters had their pictures taken with lady patricia 
 and shared stories and photographs lady patricia was particularly moved by meeting with those soldiers wounded most recently in afghanistan 
 and their families she wrote that it was very emotional and my admiration for them all is unbounded the month

 keith morley and private david byers were killed all three soldiers were buried on 29 september in their hometowns in 
 full military funerals conducted by soldiers from the second battalion particularly poignant was the fact that seven soldiers comrades injured 
 in the same 18 september attack were in attendance at keith morley s funeral in winnipeg regrettably a sad end 
 to the month and another indication of the cost that 2 ppcli has borne along with her sister battalions and

 joy of the season the dinner was an opportunity to celebrate promotions and awards and close out a year filled 
 with extreme highs and lows not only for the battalion but the regiment throughout the day all of our thoughts 
 were with two other groups those comrades in alpha company serving with the 1 rcr task force in afghanistan and

 police association event sponsored by the hong kong police and realized that i would be enroute to hong kong on 
 november 11 and unable to attend any remembrance day services i arranged my trip so that i would arrive on 
 the 10th and hopefully find something to attend i contacted the canadian embassy in hong kong who put me in 
 touch with the royal british legion hong kong branch and the hong kong ex serviceman s association hkesa who were 
 organizing the event mr peter seiesen lays a wreath on behalf of the ppcli association the hkesa asked if i 
 would like to lay a wreath on behalf of the regiment of course i said it would be an honour 
 i then contacted the president and secretary of the association concerning representing the association in hong kong i had two 
 choices of colours for the wreath so i consulted my good friend ed hansen and we chose red on arrival 
 at our hotel in hong kong there was an envelope waiting for me at the front desk from the hkesa 
 with tickets security passes program information etc very well done remembrance day services are always held on the 2nd sunday 
 of november in hong kong on arrival at the cenotaph i quickly got orientated located our wreath and mingled with 
 other veterans i was welcomed by brigadier christopher hammerbeck cb president of the hong kong branch royal british legion shortly 
 after that a gentlemen introduced himself as former ldsh rc he was mr lan mcnabb executive director of the canadian 
 chamber of commerce in hk on arrival back in canada i checked him out and found that he was a 
 former commanding officer of the ldsh rc a real nice guy accompanied by his lovely wife made us feel very 
 welcome then up comes a young fellow dressed very casual and introduces himself mark dorrington recently a corporal with the 
 2 nc battalion patricias and recently returned from a tour in afghanistan he is employed in his father in laws 
 company which has offices in hk a real gung ho young man so typical of the fine young men in 
 the armed forces today particularly the patricias a former officer of the regiment also introduced himself but disappeared before i 
 could get his name i was positioned right behind the gurkha veterans i had an opportunity to observe 
 64 the patrician 2006 them closely and believe me i was impressed with their demeanor i would always want them 
 on my side no question the timing of the program was very punctual and exactly as per times shown on 
 the program the wreaths were laid from three sides simultaneously and were completed in ten minutes absolutely amazing after the 
 ceremony was over the wreaths were taken to the sai wan war cemetery and displayed there editor s note peter

 65 the patrician 2006 3vp a company two thousand and six was one of the busiest in recent memory for 
 the soldiers of a company coy january saw the coy scattered as both candidates and staff on numerous courses as 
 part of the winter pcf cycle in mid february the coy packed up and moved out to wainwright for exercise 
 ex arctic strike a 15 day validation exercise prior to deploying to cambridge bay nu for a sovop while ex 
 arctic strike was supposed to focus solely on preparing the platoons for live fire platoon attacks the lack of snow 
 on the previous novembers winter indoctrination ex meant that many in the coy had to quickly relearn tent routine when 
 the ex wrapped up the coy redeployed to edmonton where thanks to some stellar air force planning they had two 
 to four days at home before flying up to cambridge bay for ex arctic patricia 06 over the course of 
 its two weeks in and around cambridge bay the coy participated in a five day arctic survival deployment extended to 
 six by a well timed blizzard a four day tactical deployment and a community sports day and bbq upon return 
 to edmonton the coy took some well earned leave to relax and thaw out but there is no rest for 
 the wicked and in may the coy along with the rest of the battalion headed down to dundurn for a 
 three week gun camp the days were long and so were the ranges but the coy soldiered on with trademark 
 determination in mid june the coy deployed for a two week patrol ex in scenic hinton ab the terrain was 
 challenging and as the company sergeant major found out even more so when someone steals the chocolate bar from your 
 ration the coy left hinton with a new appreciation of both mountainous terrain and orders interpretation 
 66 the patrician 2006 3vp july saw most of the coy on leave except for a composite platoon who got 
 to spend three weeks in kamloops bc harassing canadian special operations regiment as enemy force it was a rough go 
 with both deployed locations being almost 1000 m from the nearest beach but the soldiers of a coy pulled through 
 in fine form september saw the coy in shilo for another round of ranges ending with a coy level raid 
 on a simulated enemy compound at the end of the year the coy was back on primary combat functions courses 
 as well as planning for 2007 the new year promises to be full of surprises and challenges as the coy 
 makes the move from light to lav borne for task force 1 08 the closing of a coy lines in 
 3 ppcli provided a fitting conclusion to a busy year and the promise of more of the same for the 
 future 
 67 the patrician 2006 3vp b company this past year has been a period of recuperation and rebuilding for b 
 company coy with operation archer coming to a close the beginning of 2006 had b coy move from debarkation leave 
 to life back into battalion lines the soldiers returning from kandahar were placed into newly formed platoons as well as 
 into other elements of the battalion a significant number of personnel were moved into recce platoon making room in the 
 coy for new soldiers arriving from basic infantry qualification once back in garrison routine b coy prepared to take on 
 a training role assisting other companies in their preparations for deployment with its new organization fine tuned the coy moved 
 off to dundurn with the intent of training other sub units in section and platoon operations continuing to assist in 
 the training of personnel within the battalion b coy moved to hinton for exercise mountain warrior halfway through the exercise 
 a new group of soldiers arrived to augment the ranks these mostly young and enthusiastic troops were quickly made aware 
 of their role within the framework of the coy the exercise focused on patrolling at detachment to coy level and 
 had b coy acting as opposing force during this exercise particular attention was paid to the stanley cup playoffs using 
 enemy televisions once summer leave came to an end theatre mission specific training tmst training commenced for c coy in 
 both garrison and in shilo at this point b coy welcomed its new exchange officer from first battalion royal 22nd 
 regiment the vandoos as the new coy second in command captain guilbaud mcharg all those with experience in the french 
 language quickly learned just how much they did not understand about the quebecois dialect the training in garrison focused largely 
 on urban warfare and improvised explosive devices led reaction and tactics in shilo in early september the training moved towards 
 live fire operations and further tmst training for other units preparing for afghanistan upon re deployment the battalion along with

 told that we would be joining 2 rcr for their deployment to afghanistan in february 2007 as part of task 
 force 1 07 with that overarching goal in our minds we began work up training with a view to honing 
 our skills for the kandahar theatre we began our year with exercise ex spartan warrior in dundurn saskatchewan to complete 
 individual battle task standards ibts and levels 2 and 3 live fire ranges during the ex we welcomed a 39 
 canadian brigade group contingent of reservist augmentees mostly from mainland 8 c who left their jobs schools etc in order 
 to participate in canada s afghan commitment highlights of the exercise were the section and platoon live fire attacks both 
 day and night conducted in the flames started by too many pyrotechnics during dry weather the smoke and destruction added 
 greatly to the realism of training also of note during the deployment was the extremely high quality of our company 
 field kitchen following dundurn major c r henderson replaced major c b barr as officer commanding c coy and mwo 
 green replaced mwo meier as company sergeant major with the new c coy made up of both regular force and 
 reservist soldiers now a tightly knit team we began planning training for the remainder of the year in may c 
 coy headed out to iniskillen british columbia in order to practice basic mountain operations and to further cement the team 
 rappelling rock face climbing and fastwater 0:fast 0:water crossing were just some of the skills we learned and or refreshed 
 with june came ex mountain warrior in hinton alberta this battalion level patrol school allowed information gathered by reconnaissance to 
 affect section to company operations both ground based and airmobile the exercise was broken into two phases with platoon sized 
 patrol base operations leading into operations mounted from the battalion forward operating base fob c coy conducted a very successful 
 cordon and search operation as well as a more classic coy attack both by helicopter insertion the final day of 
 the exercise featured a 20km evacuation by foot during which sections made their way back to a link up point 
 challenges included swamps at every altitude a large amount of deadfall rain and our outdated circa 1970 era maps although 
 most were miserable at the time all c coy soldiers were able to complete the nature walk and can now 
 reflect on it with a laugh 
 the patrician 2006 70 3vp after a couple jumps in late june and upon the return from a much needed 
 summer break in july c coy refocused and began theatre mission specific training tmst based out of cfb edmonton the 
 training which ran through much of august featured urban and vehicle luvw based operations and crowd control operations cco the 
 soldiers enjoyed what was mostly unfamiliar training with the highlight being oleoresin capsicum oc spray inoculation training a blast of 
 potent pepper spray to the face and then the completion of a mini obstacle course during august the company leadership 
 visited gagetown new brunswick to participate in a computer based tactical exercise without troops tewt this gave us our first 
 contact with 2 rcr and the battle group headquarters for task force 1 07 in september c coy deployed to 
 shilo manitoba for ex spartan ram prairie viper this was our final check from 3 ppcli that we were ready 
 to deploy to gagetown for 2 rcr s final confirmation and that we were ready for canadian manoeuver training centre 
 cmtc the validation centre before theatre 2 ppcli in shilo provided the company with an excellent live fire company range 
 complete with compounds bunkers and pillboxes that tested a wide range of the lessons learned during august c coy returned 
 from our first battle group exercise in gagetown in early october ex royal archer ii provided an excellent opportunity for 
 the company to show their mettle to 2 cmbg with the highlight being our completion of the company live fire 
 range with the help of two tanks in less than 90 minutes the exercise ended interestingly in our first battle 
 group size attack 
 71 the patrician 2006 3vp late in the year we went to cmtc and ex maple guardian in wainwright alberta 
 for a five week battle group validation exercise besides the weather the vehicles that we used our interaction with local 
 population weapons effects and the scope of our missions the ex was a perfect preparation tool for afghanistan the month 
 was important for the melding of ppcllisms rcrisms and the various other units isms although we all love wainwright it 
 is safe to say that c coy soldiers were happy to be back in edmonton the 2006 training year closed 
 fast and after some individual courses the c coy had a much deserved christmas break after santa claus parachutes some 
 usable tactical vests and desert boots down our chimneys hopefully we will officially be ready for deployment bring it on 
 2007 combat support company this past year has been full of intensive training for combat support company signals platoon and 
 recce platoon have been an integral part of the complex exercises that the battalion has been involved in and they 
 have gained valuable experience from their highly specialized roles signals platoon has been very busy with providing support to three 
 major exercises happening in dundurn saskatchewan hinton alberta and shilo manitoba the exercise in hinton was a particular challenge for 
 communications because it took place in mountainous terrain our communications plan had to adapt to the numerous sections patrolling the 
 area to make sure that everyone could talk back to our base for obvious safety reasons we deployed three radio 
 rebroadcast detachments and we sent extra signalers to operate with the rifle companies members of the platoon had the opportunity 
 to participate in helicopter operations in patrols and in different ranges throughout the three exercises this reminded us all of 
 signals dual role before being communications specialists they are soldiers in the late spring of 2006 recce platoon was deployed 
 to dundurn saskatchewan with the intentions of integrating with the ldsh rc as part of task force 1 07 unfortunately 
 this did not go as planned however it allowed for the platoon to conduct some much needed live fire training 
 the exercise closed with some escape and evasion training against the coyote armoured reconnaissence vehicle not surprisingly the light fighters 
 were successful in beating the beast in june of 2006 recce platoon was deployed on a battalion mountainous exercise in 
 the hinton foothills initially sent on point recce tasks this developed into leading platoon s and company s into objectives 
 and setting up landing zone s lz for extractions the final effort

 lz september of 2006 had members of recce platoon constructing and conducting ranges for the battalion in shilo manitoba besides 
 the poison ivy acquired by some members it was an altogether positive and worthwhile exercise since these exercises the platoon

 the patrician 2006 74 3vp administration company the year started slow and i recall it was in may that things 
 really began to start up dundurn was the location for the exercise and three weeks was the time given for 
 preparations administration company is always kept busy during the lead up and deployment to an exercise the maintenance throughout and 
 the teardown after completion transport is no exception it is as always a multi tasked crew from ammunition drivers to 
 troop lift to kitchen detail the least favorite and various other assignments right after dundurn i went to suffield to 
 drive dangerous goods for 1 ppcli this is a common scenario within the platoon as we are not only responsible 
 for assisting the battalion on exercise but also called upon to support other units courses or training bases the hot 
 weather and endless mosquitoes in southern alberta made it challenging but getting to know the guys made it easier and 
 made the time pass quickly every day i would go for ammo sometimes twice a day picking up 25mm or 
 7 62 mm as 1 ppcli s gunner s course and regular infantry training required a steady supply of bullets 
 it was hectic but we all made it through and accomplished some solid training two weeks after suffield administration company 
 was off once again this time to hinton alberta where we would spend two weeks in the field logistics platoon 
 achieved significant success in setting up the battalion forward operating base on an abandoned airfield soon destroyed by continuous rain 
 and heavy vehicles and did an excellent job keeping the area livable for the battalion for the duration of the 
 exercise transport platoon was on the go from day one to the end for most of the guys hinton was 
 hectic and relentless with early mornings and late nights the duties comprised garbage pick up general duties transporting troops and 
 another rotation of kitchen duties the use of all terrain vehicle s enhanced our ability to achieve our many tasks 
 and also made for some fun ripping up and down the hills picking up garbage and fueling up generators given 
 the heavy rain maintenance platoon was busy throughout the exercise overall hinton was a wet long two weeks but the 
 food provided by the battalion s cooks maintained morale and the summer leave that started once the exercise finished greatly 
 enhanced our overall morale exercise spartan ram prarie viper in shilo manitoba was the last exercise of 2006 maintenance platoon 
 was kept busy in the lead up to the exercise preparing all vehicles for a long road move and were 
 consistently employed in recovery and repair during the conduct of training transport platoon was involved in the same routines and 
 activities the ammo drivers continued to deliver and the troop carrying vehicle drivers made sure the troops were dropped off 
 on time logistics platoon once again ensured that the supplies required by the battalion were always available the cooks worked 
 their usual magic and everyone had the energy to carry on with challenging training luckily the weather was nice which 
 made it smoother and drier than hinton but the plague of black flies was a constant distraction like all of 
 the soldiers in the battalion we fought through to the end 
 75 the patrician 2006 3vp the year ended with some guys finding their way back to the rifle companies and 
 some new faces coming to administration company we split our time between supporting courses and taskings and getting our winter 
 vehicles snowmobiles and bv2o6 s ready to be loaned out most of the new guys in the company went on 
 their light utility vehicle wheeled airbrakes and other driving courses as i already had these i went on the communications 
 course all of administration company has had a very busy year the wear and tear that the battalion puts on 
 its vehicles ensures that the maintainers next door are always working on something logistics platoon has the unending task of 
 providing all of the stores and set up bullets parachutes and supplies required to make training possible the cooks provide 
 a warm plate and a hot drink without fail and transport platoon keeps the battalion ready to move and consistently 
 rolling in the right direction we were all glad to be home for a short while over the home depot

 also known as combined task force ctf aegis hq which deployed to afghanistan in 2006 to take over command of 
 regional command rc south from the 173 rd airborne brigade us army tf bayonet ctf aegis would be responsible for 
 the southern six provinces of afghanistan and for forces from 10 different nato and coalition nations including the 1 ppcli 
 battle group dubbed tf orion in addition to the 1 ppcli battle group in kandahar province ctf aegis included a 
 british brigade minus based on 16 air assault brigade and 3rd battalion the parachute regiment deployed to helmand province a

 during the battle of pashmul taking over a machine gun during a critical assault and then becoming a defacto task 
 force executive officer for a us special forces task force not bad for a staff flopper eh the nine month 
 tour february to november 2006 was perhaps the most challenging deployment for the canadian forces since korea and included a 
 long list of impressive achievements by ctf aegis including the first ground combat operation undertaken by nato since its inception 
 op medusa the spearhead for many of these operations was task force 
 78 the patrician 2006 ere orion and all ppcli members of ctf aegis hq were extremely proud of the way 
 that the 1 ppcli battle group acquitted itself with courage conviction and a can do spirit that set the standard 
 for all units operating in afghanistan we also watched with pride the exploits of the patricias working in the kandahar 
 provincial reconstruction team and with the 1 rcr battle group that replaced tf orion where major mike wright s company 
 group from 2 ppcli demonstrated the required standard to our rcr brethren meanwhile back in canada patricias continued to hold 
 down the fort with major pat i quealey taking over as the g 3 for icmbg to be followed by 
 major tod strickland upon his i return from afghanistan another hectic year awaits the filthy staff swine at brigade hq

 one of seven corps within the afghan national army the rotation 1 team was only the fifth team rotation in 
 this area of operations ao this teams mission was two fold immediately at hand they were to cycle afghan kandaks 
 650 800 man battalions through a final collective training programme prior to this stage soldiers completed their basic and moc 
 training select individuals would have further completed nco and officer training it was finally at the collective training exercise ctx 
 phase where the kandak and its leadership married up for the first time given british french romanian and mongolian influence 
 final collective standardization was critical to develop cohesion and prepare for immediate combat operations the ctx phase was approximately three 
 weeks in duration utilizing dry and live fire scenarios and had evolved over a seven month period based on input 
 from coalition forces the relevance of collective training phase came to light as the first graduated kandak from roto 1 
 fought it out at their fob regimental day the other task at hand was to build and train the ctx 
 cadre of afghan officers and ncos to set the conditions for afghans training afghans aquisition of qualified men and resources 
 is a pain in the ammo pouch in any multi national formation especially when there s a war going on 
 by the end of the tour its foundation had come together the conditions for success were laid for roto 2 
 given they were scheduled to train 1200 2000 man kandaks theirs too would be an equally memorable tour in recognition

 training for a possible deployment overseas eventually the entire company was in wainwright supporting the training up to and including 
 combat team live day and night the lav tua was put to the test once again and surpassed all of 
 the expectations during the platoon live night portion the lav tua was the only platform that was able to effectively 
 engage the targets at night because of the huge advantage offered by the itas destroying a wide array of targets 
 including cars and trucks fortified bunkers moving and stationary targets at ranges from 100 3550 m the lav tua proved 
 that when precision direct fire is desired e coy was the answer the company re focused on training by running

 and we see elements of the company supporting missions overseas in a lav tua role i in the shadow of 
 parliament hill ottawa patricias not far from where the regiment held its first parade patricias still proudly represent all of 
 you in ottawa be it on parades at the war memorial rideau hall or the war museum at ndhq or 
 the national military cemetery the regiment is recognized and canadians know who we are the courage and professionalism our soldiers 
 have demonstrated in afghanistan and the sacrifices of our fallen have made our cap badge a symbol that is known 
 to many ottawa is not a garrison town yet as we walk to work or take the bus many ordinary 
 canadians who have not known us before offer their thanks there are not that many of us in ottawa but 
 we have made our mark you will find patricias supporting the primary reserve with the govenor general s foot guard 
 working on projects for clothe the soldier or supporting operations as part of the army land staff standing right beside 
 us on many occasions is a strong and proud association there are also many personnel in ottawa who have been 
 posted to a battalion in a support role and they take comfort in seeing the patricia cap badge again unlike 
 the battalion there are no training cycles exercises or deployments to mark our calendar ours is a somewhat routine and 
 hectic existence that is not fully understood by those outside of ottawa suffice to say whatever you are doing in 
 the army at present it starts here and there is a good chance that a patricia was involved operations and 
 whatever support is required to sustain them occupies the majority of our time on the army land staff and the 
 planning is well into the future and whatever that holds ottawa is an eye opener and you would be surprised 
 by the work that is accomplished here if you spent time here on staff then you are well aware of 
 the challenges and rewards of working at national defence headquarters ottawa is naturally a great city to live in and 
 many of us commute from communities on the outskirts be it running or skating down the rideau canal or biking 
 along the pathways and into the gatineau ottawa is a city with much more to offer with museums hockey and 
 a central location that is hard to beat the one event that has brought serving and retired patricias together this 
 year is the loss of our soldiers overseas and their repatriation to canada many families choose to have their loved 
 ones buried at the national military cemetery at beechwood in ottawa as you wander among the headstones the number of 
 patricia cap badges becomes apparent they lie close to their fallen comrades from other regiments and are in good company 
 the patricia family is always represented at the many internments regardless of regimental affiliation it is on these somber occasions 
 that one can feel the pain and anguish of grieving parents wives and children yet the enduring pride of those 
 families and the embrace of their regimental family is inspiring it has been a busy year in ottawa as elsewhere 
 on the few occasions that the association and serving members have come together they have always been well attended with 
 many memories shared and a moment taken to remember those who have passed away or fallen in battle the regiment 
 is strong and well represented here in the nation s capital we are all proud to represent one of canada 
 s finest regiments vp

 view as to how to best prepare them for operational duty as the army expands we expect not to be 
 less busy but more so and it is a challenge that most of us relish capt pretty at the courcellette

 98 the patrician 2006 association message from the president ever since the patrician was started as a regimental publication way 
 back in may of 1933 the association or rather the old pp s reported news about old pp s activities 
 and since the 19505 news covering the activities of the association branches while the patrician changed over the years in 
 style and format its central role never did to set out a faithful record of the regiment s activities and 
 to keep in touch with the scattered members of our regimental family the association has and will continue to play 
 a significant role in the historical record of the regiment 2006 has indeed been a much troubled year for our 
 regiment aside the fatal casualties the regiment suffered many wounded from operations in afghanistan the association through the volunteer patricia 
 program helped and continues to help convalescing patricias by providing financial assistance where support is not available from other sources 
 the association made a substantial donation to the fisher house at landstuhl germany where our evacuated wounded received excellent care 
 the volunteer patricia program is a collective effort by the association primarily in support of our serving members we look 
 forward to expanding the program and services to soldiers about to retire and to those veterans of the regiment who 
 need our help the regiment too has addressed the care of our wounded by assigning a warrant officer as the 
 regimental veteran s care warrant officer in regimental headquarters operation small pack was an equally outstanding success through donations from 
 across the country and proceeds from our casino operation we were able to promptly respond over 20 small packs were 
 sent to afghanistan and with the balance of funds placed in an endowment we can respond equally prompt in any 
 future emergency it remains our policy to help our serving members and their families who need a helping hand part 
 of my message this year remains the same and that is to challenge patricias about to retire or indeed those 
 who are still serving to join the association and thus strengthen the regimental family a family however is more than 
 the sum of its parts a family is a cohesive unit inwardly connected to each of its members and ready 
 to challenge any and all external forces to accomplish this we need a broadly based well informed highly motivated membership 
 in which all members enjoy equality of status and have an equal opportunity to plan and participate in the association 
 s if not in the regiment s affairs our focus remains therefore on our active membership and its participation in 
 regimental activities the association is committed to and will continue to be an important member of the regimental family yes 
 we have much accomplished over the last years but more remains to be done while 2006 has been a very 
 eventful year indeed we look to 2007 full with anticipation and focus on the 60 tn anniversary of the association 
 to be held over the labour day weekend in calgary the association is rightly proud to look back 60 years 
 all without exception in the service of the regiment we are indeed proud to have followed in the footsteps of 
 the patricia clubs formed after ww i i am sure the association s responsibilities have grown well beyond that envisioned 
 by our founder hamilton gault on that famous weekend in september of 1947 by the time you have read this 
 article the calgary branch as the host will have done all that is needed to be done for a successful 
 celebration all readers of the patrician are encouraged to attend this celebration in 2007 additional details are provided in this 
 edition of the patrician finally as my appointment as president of the ppcli association comes to an end i want 
 to take this opportunity to thank the membership you are the association thank you for attending the annual meetings and 
 volunteering for the various association committees thank you for your support and contribution to the ppcli association over the past 
 sixty years thank you to the staff at regimental headquarters for the association could not function without your sterling support 
 last but not least thanks to the members of the regimental guard and regimental executive committee past and present for 
 the trust they have shown in my ability to manage the regimental finances during my tenure as regimental adjutant and 
 exceptional support while conducting the affairs of the association each and every one of you has assisted in no small 
 way to making my tasks enjoyable and a continual source of personal satisfaction my formal association with you must come 
 to an end however after 25 years of working for and on behalf of the association i find that these 
 have been my years of renewal i say renewal for the membership of the association embodies the esprit of the 
 regiment so magnificently fostered by those who went before me as president the regiment and indeed the association have been 
 my second family thank you merci beaucoup vielen dank rudy raidt president

 all day lenny our bus driver made plenty of stops he gave us information on what to expect at the 
 border and while in the us by day two we were in the holiday mode relaxing with movies music and
