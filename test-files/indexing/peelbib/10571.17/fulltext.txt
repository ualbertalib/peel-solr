 the patrician 1 regimental notes a regiment s affairs however little are important to the regiment itself princess patricia s 
 canadian light infantry was formed in ottawa and after each campaign abroad the regiment s home station has been changed 
 after world war i the regiment returned to ottawa and after a short period in ontario moved to winnipeg manitoba 
 regimental headquarters and a company were located at fort osborne barracks b company was located at work point barracks in 
 esquimalt b c on the outbreak of world war 2 the regiment was recruited to battalion strength and concentrated in 
 winnipeg for the move overseas following world war 2 the regiment returned to winnipeg and after a few months moved 
 to currie barracks in calgary it was inevitable therefore that the regiment should move again following the korean campaign it 
 is not for reasons political or strategical that this latest move is necessary it is a case of history repeating 
 itself the new home station now under construction is located in edmonton alberta the regimental depot will move to the 
 prince of wales armouries in october but occupation of the new barracks is not expected until 1956 the regiment regrets 
 leaving the friendly city of calgary and there will be many rough spots and heartaches ahead before our new home 
 is occupied however in keeping with tradition we shall face the future with our tails up and our powder dry

 high calibre of the students i was quite amused as an ex rmc cadet to hear that bearers are provided 
 on a scale of one for eight cadets they bring tea to the cadets in the morning and evening and 
 clean their shoes the vastness of this establishment can be appreciated by the fact that each cadet is issued with 
 a bicycle to allow him to get around you may be surprised to know that the regiment is well known

 the patrician 29 lt col g r stevens obe regimental historian reports in the montreal herald three thousand people packed 
 massey hall toronto 6 may 1955 to the rafters and all but took the roof off the occasion arose out 
 of the decision of a group of veterans of princess patricia s canadian light infantry to pay their respects to 
 brigadier andrew hamilton gault the founder of the regiment with three wars under his belt brigadier gault still is going 
 strong but time will close upon him as upon all of us it is not likely that his statue will 
 be put in a public place after he is gone for he would loathe it he probably would find a 
 way to come back and wreck the thing so his old hands decided to give him a party 6 7

 lotta dempsey of the globe and mail the dumbells were disbanded 0:dis 0:banded before she was born wrote the dumbells 
 in a quiet and gentle sort of way are fabulous the gay and gallant innocence the warm buffoonery the rupert 
 brookesian 0:brook 0:esian romanticism of the 1914 1918 0:1914 0:1918 years still must be wandering somewhere around the world in 
 some lost place waiting to be evoked at the call of the old voices the old voices are the standards 
 of behaviour the beliefs and the certainties which have worn thin in these brittle years but they do live on 
 not as miss dempsey suggests in any lost place but here at home in the hearts of the oncoming generation 
 all that is needed is a bugle for that was what the frolic in massey hall really was to rouse 
 the young men and woman of today to the role which loyalties and disciplines play in the making of tomorrow 
 0:to 0:morrow this other sort of laughter this different set of social values is an inheritance not to be discarded 
 0:discard 0:ed but to be cherished perhaps in the future as in 1914 1918 it may save the day the

 the patrician 30 the rifle brigade the melbourne university regiment allied with the rifle brigade this famous regiment was founded 
 0:found 0:ed as the melbourne university rifles in 1910 prior to that year students from the university had enrolled themselves 
 0:them 0:selves in local volunteer corps in 1883 a complete company for the 4th victoria rifles was found by the 
 university and in 1895 the university corps of officers was formed military endeavour of this nature ceased to exist at 
 the university on the federation of the commonwealth of australia in 1 901 between the years 1901 and 1910 although 
 the activities of the university 0:univer 0:sity of melbourne founded in 1856 had developed progressively in all other directions no 
 military organization 0:organ 0:ization existed in which students could fit themselves to do their part in the defence of the 
 empire a project emanating from the university itself to form a volunteer corps was approved by the government 0:govern 0:ment 
 in 1910 the unit was accordingly ennsted with an establishment of one company 0:com 0:pany strength five officers and 1 
 20 other ranks the sole aim and purpose 0:pur 0:pose of the corps announced at the time was to train 
 leaders for the australian army universal military training introduced 0:intro 0:duced in australia in 1911 had farreaching 0:far 0:reaching effects 
 on the newly formed regiment strength was made dependent 0:depen 0:dent on the number of students at the university and 
 the establishment raised to provide four companies in 1914 the military organization in australia was for home defence only with 
 the outbreak of world war i this was completely changed and an entirely new army known as the australian imperial 
 force was recruited for overseas service how well the regiment carried out its role is recorded during the years of 
 conflict when 794 of its members saw service with the overseas 0:over 0:seas force it is of great interest to 
 note that 
 the patrician 31 the famous commander of the overseas 0:over 0:seas force the late general sir john monash gcmg kcb 
 yd was a graduate and took part in such military 0:mili 0:tary training as was possible at the university during 
 his student years 1883 1887 the termination of the war brought the usual reduction in establishment 0:estab 0:lishment strength and 
 funds available 0:avail 0:able for training with corresponding retrenchment in the function of the regiment annual camps schools etc were 
 perforce brought to the minimum necessary to existence further universal military training was discontinued by the government and the unit 
 reverted to a strictly volunteer basis by 1928 it consisted 0:consist 0:ed of two companies despite this an average strength 
 of 450 all ranks was maintained during the years between the wars efficiency was kept at the highest level the 
 records of the times describe 0:de 0:scribe numerous occasions when general efficiency and shooting awards in both brigade and command 
 0:com 0:mand annual competitions were won by the regiment general monash was appointed colonel of the regiment in 1920 and 
 fulfilled this duty until his death the darkening international situation 0:situ 0:ation in early 1939 resulted in the re introduction 
 of universal service by the government when hostilities commenced in september the regiment was at its old establishment of four 
 rifle companies 0:com 0:panies and had a strength of nearly 900 all ranks almost immediately the unit was named as 
 the base on which to build a full time officers training centre and established itself first at camp mount martha 
 and later at camp bonegilla by the summer of 1942 1 162 officers had been trained and sent to the 
 second australian imperial 0:im 0:perial force in june of 1942 a new policy affecting the training of officers caused the 
 disbandment of the melbourne 0:mel 0:bourne university rifles as such the work of the regiment and its members continued under 
 other names until the end of the war the regiment was re raised in 1948 but due to the requirements 
 of a modern army it was felt that the cream of the officer material could no longer be directed only 
 to the infantry the title the melbourne 0:mel 0:bourne university regiment was therefore adopted with enlarged establishment to include the 
 training 0:train 0:ing of officers for armour artillery engineers signals and mechanical engineers as well as infantry the rifle heritage 
 of the regiment 0:regi 0:ment is however still strong it is proud to wear facings of rifle green as a 
 mark of this affiliation from this brief description it is obvious that the regiment has always 0:al 0:ways made and 
 is still making a great contribution to the military forces of australia and the empire year by year the unit 
 provides keen and well trained young officers 0:offi 0:cers all capable of leading in battle as the magnificent record of 
 service in two world wars amply proves some vital statistics of the regiment 0:regi 0:ment are here appended colonel of

 saw concentrated wireless training within the regiment culminating 0:culmi 0:nating in a two day wireless exercise held in the prince 
 of wales armouries 0:ar 0:mouries edmonton this was quite successful considering that many of the people taking part had not 
 operated 0:oper 0:ated sets before about this time the regiment lost the services of sgt lou langell who was posted 
 from the i and a staff to prairie command sgt langell had been attached to the regiment since 1947 and 
 had performed invaluable service under several commanding officers he was also a tower of strength in various softball teams run

 shortly after his enlistment 0:enlist 0:ment he is of course no stranger to currie barracks having served in ppcli for 
 a number of years he proved to be invaluable to the regiment 0:regi 0:ment not only on the square but 
 also in instructing both senior and junior nco classes another welcome addition 0:addi 0:tion from ppcli was sgt lloyd monson 
 who came to us shortly after his discharge from the regulars 0:regu 0:lars he is now a wo 2 and 
 served as rsm for the duration of the annual 0:an 0:nual summer camp in rsm purkis s absence on june 
 5 the regiment together with other units in 23 militia group were inspected by major general chris yokes general officer 
 0:offi 0:cer commanding western command 0:com 0:mand this parade was by far the largest held in edmonton since the second 
 world war insofar as militia units were concerned and over 180 members of the loyal edmonton regiment took part together 
 with the band which played for the march past afterwards for this parade troops were brought in from all out 
 of town points those from dawson creek and grande prairie being flown in by aircraft of the rcaf the regimental 
 cadet corps paraded 0:parad 0:ed with the battalion and impressed everyone with their smart appearance 0:appear 0:ance and drill from 
 9 july to 16 the regiment was in camp sarcee for the annual infantry militia camp together with troops from 
 the canadian scottish 0:scot 0:tish the seaforth highlanders the calgary highlanders the westminster 0:westmin 0:ster regiment and the rocky mountain 
 0:moun 0:tain rangers the battalion took part in a two day exercise to practise attack 0:at 0:tack counter attack and 
 withdrawal this culminated several days of training in the field brushing up the lessons that the troops had been taking 
 during the previous winter the unit was blessed with another fine week of sarcee weather the second year in a 
 row and although several of the boys had bad cases of sunburn everyone agreed that the time had been well 
 spent the regiment 0:regi 0:ment was teamed up with the calgary 0:cal 0:gary highlanders in a defensive role for the 
 major part of the two day exercise but managed to launch a very successful counter attack on the last morning 
 of the scheme so successful indeed that the seaforths 0:sea 0:forths were still clearing remnants of the defending calgary highlanders 
 0:highland 0:ers when the edmonton s arrived on the scene much to the discomfort and embarrassment of the coast troops 
 plans are now well under way for the fall and winter training parades and with a larger strength than for 
 several years it is anticipated that this will be one of our best years ever one of the first duties 
 of the battalion will be to provide a guard of honour for the prime minister the rt hon louis st 
 laurent when he visits edmonton in connection with the alberta golden jubilee celebrations this is scheduled for early september and 
 at the time of writing the unit is parading twice weekly in preparation for the event it will be seen 
 from the foregoing that the loyal edmonton regiment is keeping very busy and we feel sure that ppcli can be 
 proud of its representatives in the militia army of today we need hardly add that when ppcli eventually moves up 
 to edmonton it will be a happy day indeed for the loyal edmonton 0:edmon 0:ton regiment we feel sure that 
 it will enable us to bind even tighter those bonds that now unite us so strongly

 gray of the first battalion received a glockenspiel for princess patricia s canadian light infantry the second in a series 
 of articles by mr john fisher is published here the subject selected is very dear to the hearts of all 
 calgarians the calgary stampede at the calgary stampede there are always a great number of american visitors some of whom 
 refer to alberta as the texas of canada they mean it as a compliment but alberta doesn t really have 
 to be compared with texas or any other state or place there s only one alberta in the world it 
 s so big so varied in resources climate and everything else that we refer to it proudly as our heritage 
 there are few other areas in the world with as much variety as alberta it all stems from a heritage 
 reaching back into the dawn of history when dinosaurs roamed alberta and includes resources on the hoof in the topsoil 
 under the ground in the mountains above the clouds into the yawning north of adventure and in rushing mountain waters 
 there is timber and coal oil and water beef and grain in alberta it s a province of mountain jewels 
 and sub arctic tundra dry hot badlands and freezing mountain temperatures where range meets range and soil reaches to the 
 sky in alberta drills probe the canyons of the earth for oil and gas miners in the crows nest strip 
 coal above the clouds 
 the patrician 36 texas is a rich and a huge state with a furious growth of industries but texas has 
 no rocky mountains or names like banff jasper lake louise and waterton you can t ski in july in texas 
 but you can in alberta there are no dog teams trap lines or tote roads in texas but there are 
 in alberta big game hunters from around the world don t descend on texas but in alberta hunters speak of 
 big game hunting with the same respect as they do in africa alberta stands for tall timber too for cattle 
 coal gas oil wheat vegetables and furs it s incredible when you consider the wealth of the province and the 
 beauty of it is that we ve only scratched the surface only a lifetime ago alberta sod was virgin soil 
 and her mountain passes had been seen by only a few white men but tomorrow if the world lives in 
 partnership instead of two camps edmonton which a short time ago was a fort on the north saskatchewan river may 
 be a great crossroad of the world for alberta is the gateway to the north to alaska and the orient 
 alberta isn t the texas of canada she s alberta she has many things in common with texas like raising 
 cattle and having colorful independent ranches scrambling for oil and talking big of tomorrow having rolling plains and the big 
 sky but the main link with texas is the western spirit texas is western and so is alberta texas is 
 friendly and so is alberta texas is proud of her history and so is alberta texas is rodeo crazy and 
 so is alberta if the province of alberta herself is a wonder of contrast and potential then too the stampede 
 is a little of everything it telescopes the nostalgia of the past with the buoyant philosophy of faith in tomorrow 
 when people see the indians and mounties there it brings back in one tremendous punch the history of the province 
 a history so young and full of dignity people who see those oldtimers at the stampede can catch at once 
 the feeling of the struggles and conquests of the plain and range the loneliness of the settler and the courage 
 of yesterday no other rodeo or stampede anywhere honors its oldtimers as much as calgary does many people find it 
 a real pleasure to stroll inside the little square set aside for the oldtimers and listen to them and wonder 
 what they re thinking in 1953 for example the stampede honored nat christie nat didn t break land or ride 
 the lonely range but he is an oldtimer with a hand in the story of western development that s one 
 of the nice things about the calgary stampede its tenderness about the past and its furious determination to hold on 
 to something that is slowly slipping with time alberta is young and there are people living who can still remember 
 when the wagon tracks led to nowhere only just beyond over the ridge their ranks are growing slimmer now and 
 as a result there s a subconscious desire in the stampede to hold on to the spirit of the grand 
 pioneer west yes all the dimensions are here in the famous calgary stampede color of mounties indians cayuses pioneers ponies 
 tight jeaned cowhands rubbing shoulders with the city cowboys oil drillers and just plain onlookers to many visitors the biggest 
 bargain of the stampede is free it s not the thrilling chuckwagon races unique to alberta not the heaving bronks 
 and those ugly looking brahma bulls the best show to many at the stampede is the people themselves because they 
 represent a spirit unknown to themselves they are expressing 0:ex 0:pressing pleasure at the privilege of being westerners and being 
 western means being in love with the big sky with horses and steers and space with indians cowboys mounties history 
 mountains and all the things hollywood would dearly love to get into one movie but can t the uncertainties of 
 weather and crop that gamble of oil the philosophy that next year s crop will be bigger and better all 
 these are part of the stampede and our heritage many easterners living two thousand miles or more from calgary attend 
 every stampede 0:stam 0:pede and claim they wouldn t miss it for anything they love it because it makes them 
 feel younger brings out the little boy in them probably this all stems from the fact that subconsciously 0:sub 0:consciously 
 every boy wants to be a cowby at one time or another down east they d feel silly walking along 
 in a cowboy outfit but in calgary during stampede time fallen waistline cr not these same reserved easterners aren t 
 the least bit bothered at standing next to a real old cowhand with slim hips and bowed legs even though 
 they don t known how to get on or fall off a horse it s the spirit of the show 
 that brings businessmen and clerk banker and rancher oil driller and housewife out together in costume for fun it s 
 not phony it s living and enjoying life yes alberta should not be called the texas of canada it s 
 just alberta a prize in terms of resources of contrasts of scenery and climate and the greatest resource of all 
 is the spirit of the people the joy of being westerners echoed in the calgary stampede editor s note the
