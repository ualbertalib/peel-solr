 the famous five by una m ac lean canadian women have now enjoyed the privilege of calling themselves persons for
 thirty three years the only living person among the five who were responsible has this to say i think sometimes
 that women generally especially the younger women do not realize the amount of work that has been done in the
 past by a compartively small body of women in campaigning for the rights of women in political and other fields
 the person voicing this opinion is the hon irene parlby former minister without portfolio in alberta and one of the
 five alberta women who took their case as ‘ person to the privy council of england and won it action
 was initiated by another prom called four other prominent women to inent albertan judge emily murphy discuss the matter in
 1916 as a magistrate in edmonton her second case was challenged on the dr irene pariby tells of the meeting

 without and by subversive forces from five and a famous successor been fitwithin it is well that our national exis
 tingly and permanently honored by the tence should be fortified by the partici nation they served whoop up ida is
 by fred k nouse the source of whoop up s reputation as the rendezvous of bad men is traceable to
 a san diego cal newspaper the story must have been more than a column and was about as lurid as
 imagination could make it it said that fort whoop up was the rendezvous of the bloodiest band of cut throats
 that ever went unhung including escaped convicts murderers renegades and that ilk who pillage and murdered indians stole horses and
 cattle and did many other things equally as bad it is true there were such men along the border at
 that time but they were not a part of those who made the fort their headquarters at no times were
 there more than sixty men at the post and in most cases five or six traders was all that remained
 when the trappers and wolfers were out seeking pelts in those days it was policy to be on good terms
 with the indians as we traders were doing a good business and desired that friendly relations remain unbroken about all
 the indian killing that was done was by the wolfers who killed buffalo poisoned the carcasses and then gathered the
 wolf pelts some indians made it a practice to follow up the traps and poisoned meat and gather the hides
 before the wolfers could come up whenever they saw an indian stealing they pot shotted him and if other indians
 took up the fight the trappers took refuge in the fort the naming of fort whoop up is traceable to
 a frenchman named char choquette who freighted from fort benton to what was then fort hamilt a choquette did not
 know much english and whenever he learned a word he had a habit of repeating it over and over there
 was an eighty mile barren stre ch between fort benton and fort hamilton and it was a dread to the
 outfits ti at made the trip one night choquette was drawing near to the fort his ow fit was tired
 and lagging and others were complaining including charlie finaiy someone said let s whoop up and get to the fort
 this struck charlie as good phrase and he kept repeating it every now and then as they neared tie fort
 he yelled whoop up and it became a by word like all such weste n names becoming a fixture there
 were stirring times along the border about that time and many n who were not willing to have their past
 investigated but contrary to popu lr belief fort whoop up was not the gathering place for them but the home

 their hands and by the crees at widely separated points in the district one of the cruelest that shoulders that
 night dad found a bed the indians still talk about today took roll and boarded the flat cars of the
 c p r construction crews he told the place at goose lake in saskatchewan arms legs and scalps were taken
 in shipping concern to give his wages to my mother at grand forks this fight there was also the battle

 the skinner the indian told them that meai men over politics while i was in was the only thing that
 would save hi school in 1896 and almost every day child and if the child died he would re we
 would witness some sort of a fight turn and shoot them along about mid the conservatives and liberals started night
 the child died and the indian firs sparring one day in front of the palace went to begq s house

 distance and a lucky shot by one the stable the place was not ours any of the posse struck the
 indian in the longer but belonged to a mr muir of arm and broke it dropping his gun he calgary
 a lawyer who had loaned us ran for the bush at the river the police 400 and dad let him
 have it for the order was that the fugitive was to be amount of the loan taken alive the trees
 were surrounded and the indian came out in the open dad paid joe didsbury for his imwaving a large knife
 he was bleeding provements by wintering his cattle for badly from his wound and a man named him we cut
 sloughs for hay as the old lee levelled his rifle and shot him dead mowers with the smooth ledger plates
 a mountie had to take the blame and would not cut the prairie wool when we was moved to another
 district arrived at rosebud creek there were only eight other ranches along the creek thirty five miles from gleichen on

 voice telling him to get up he oke up to find no one near him and the u in had
 gone down b ut he felt better cad made another attempt to get home i e got to the top
 of the hill in sight another tragedy struck rosebud in june 1906 when mrs grace vigar had her burst appendix
 removed by dr toll a homestead doctor of carbon to get her to the hospital in calgary would have required
 moving her by a democrat to gleichen and then by train to calgary and the doctor said she would die
 on the way grace died in a matter of hours following the emergency operation which was performed in their old
 log house george ledoux was an old frenchman who lived near the vigars he was looked on as a hard
 neighbour who cared little about anything but running cattle and making money he first ranched in montana where he lost
 his hearing from lying out in the prairie for three days unconscious with mountain fever when he was found the
 ants had eaten away his ear drums although stone deaf he could follow what was said by reading lips he
 carried sheets they removed the stones dug down a of paper and a long pencil cut into few feet and
 came upon a skeleton in short pieces to get people to write any a buckskin suit wrapped in a blanket
 thing important he cut a long pencil a ball of lead was in the skull the up because nearly everyone
 after using skeleton was no doubt that of a white a pencil put it in their own pocket and man
 for in life he had his hair long and if they did get away with one of his never shaved
 jim said it was the old short ones george would still have buffalo man and went to get one of
 the some to carry on with his wife was a indians to identify the remains when daughter of a flathead
 indian chief and the indian came within a few yards of when the flathead indian reservation the grave he saw
 the beadwork on the was divided up in 1910 the ledoux s coat and the gun and rode off at
 full went back to montana to get their share speed saying ominiski ominiskil buffalo man the grave was filled in
 not far east of dead man s slough is once more and today it is in a ploughed the grave
 of buffalo hunter who lived all field his life with the indians when he got old and could no longer
 take care of around the turn of the century we himself rather than leave him to die heard a lot
 about the south where wet the indians drew lots to choose one or mange was bad and the hides literally
 more of their number to take him out dropped off the cattle however we were of camp and mercifully put
 him to death a long way north and with the govern rolled up in his blanket he was buried ment
 quarantine we hoped the mange in a shallow grave covered by stones would stay in the south of the province
 in 1885 the indians camped along the but by 1904 the mange was at rosebud rosebud creek and told old
 jim wishart and dips were built that fall the first of the white man who lived like they dip was
 built by the rosebud dipping did and that he was buried on a prairie co on section 11 27 22
 w 4 george hill in 1886 the cooks of buffalo lake hope johnson was president and dave district were building
 a log house just wishart manager for a few years thoueast of the dave wishart slough on se sands of
 cattle went through this dip 31 27 21 4 when a muzzle loading gun until more and larger dips were
 built a powder flask and a pipe were found during the first year that the walter a little way off
 a lot of rocks were ross yoke bar cattle were in the disnoticed in the shape of a grave there
 trict they were dipped at the rosebud were many stones scattered on the hill dip ted kenny built a vat
 on the l cross but to the men the pile was man made ranch in 1906 and ran a roundup
 wagon i ‘ ‘ when the mange reached rosebud country dipping vats were built by individual ranche or as community
 projects this corral and dip is seen in the valley of the rosebud in 192 uth of the rosebud creek
 to the c p r to remove the black clot formed in the itain line in a few years most
 ranches infected shoulder l ui t dipping vats at home and the first when the blackfoot indians found out 1
 osenua aip soon ien inso aecay viping went on from 1904 until 1921 and about the fat yearlings dying at
 rosebud they came out and had a sure cure j took au tnis time to knock tne mange ic out
 for blackleg they cut the animal s throat ug just before it died removed the infected in the fall of
 1904 we had a real in front quarter and had a good wholesome ci ian summer for weeks on end
 the carcass that was enjoyed by the hungry nights were cold with heavy frost and natives the infected quarter was
 buried to comply with dominion government in the early mornings prairie chickens regulations that all animals were to be on
 the high hills were strutting and buried or burnt it was risky to start drumming they would perch on the
 fires in the long grass and a lot of work frosty rails of the yard fence where we to haul
 wood to get a good fire started would pick off a few to eat we had in the fat of
 the animal it also was so many that we got tired of their dry hard to di in the umbo
 soil flesh for there was nothing like a beef steak to a cattle man the rosebud ran one sunday morning
 we started to chers enjoyed this long beautiful fall dig a hole to bury a yearling before weather the calves
 were weaned and 11 00 o clock church services in the the cows drifted off on the range the severn
 creek school house my brother cold nights ended the house flies and danny and i started a hole b ut
 it was at night we would leave the kitchen door hard work so danny decided to burn open to chill
 the poor things to the bone the animal there was very little frost in this helpless state they were swept
 that night but danny thought we could down with a broom gathered up in a burn a ittle grass at
 a time close to the dust pan and put in the cook stove fire animal until there was a big
 enough it looked like a fine break for the cattle patch to safely build a wood fire we men with
 such a long fall without even got quite a patch burnt when along a snow storm but then disaster struck
 came a gust of wind and away went one morning i rode south to where our danny s fire he
 had a saddle blanket cattle ranged and everywhere were that he used freely on the leaping flames dead yearlings in
 a few days most but for some reason i had no blanket riders were also finding dead young under my
 saddle so i had to use the shirt cattle so the veterinarian at gleichen off my back in the few
 minutes my light was asked to diagnose the trouble when cotton shirt was burning and was soon he was told
 that only yearlings were consumed i then took my eight dollar dying and that a front shoulder would stetson hat
 and i banged the flames with puff up and crackle when touched with it but the fire gained momentum and
 tie hand and was black when scored was soon out of control dave wishart v ith a knife he knew
 without coming saw the fire from the top of moujie s to see the dead animals that the disease hill
 and rode up to us he tore his sadvcls blackleg most of the ranchers got dle blanket in half and
 gave one of the tie tiny park davis pill that was in halves to me the fire was heading for
 jated in the shoulder with a needle the severn creek and hoped that it might bit there was such a
 demand that a lot stop there if the wind went down a bit a ideas came up to treat the
 blackleg but it soon was over the creek and off v hue waiting for new supplies the in the direction
 of tom till s and vlerinarian had a cure of his own formu paquette s place my dad was half
 1 that consisted of a long rag dipped way through shaving when he saw the ir something that had a
 very strong smoke he got the team and brought s iell the rag was tied in the dewlap a barrel
 of water from the creek i was ic punching a hole through it with a on the north side of
 the fire when he irge needle then there was the copper arrived and the first words he said were ire
 tied in the dewlap which tom till just as i thought soon the minister sid was a sure preventive for
 blackleg arrived he took off his coat got a wet i ith the sick animals the jugular was sack from
 the wagon and was soon as cit and a lot of blood was drawn off black as pitch men rode
 for miles when they saw the smoke and the fire was of dead horse lake then south to tite finally
 stopped on the hill at till s lake this fire guard stopped many fircs there at about four in the
 afternoon we if the wind was not too strong the old were served tea by mrs till and the fire
 guard bypassed standard to the girls south by a half mile and was used cs a road by the first
 danish settlers to who started it someone asked standard district in 1910 it was called jack cumming thought the martin
 boys the fire guard road and before the highwere carrying the most soot so they ways were made it was
 used by the first should know something about it and the car owners because it was smooth for student methodist
 minister was very travel black too for several days we expected to see a mountie coming with a summons the
 worst fire we ever had at rosebud for starting a prairie fire but he never happened in late fall of
 1905 it was came fifty eight years have gone by started near the present nightingale by since the fire so
 i guess the ivlountie two englishmen burning fire guards will not come now around their hay stacks my brother danny
 was fire guardian so he got a crew there were many fires in the passing together to fight the fire
 that had reached years each one setting the prairie grass to where the siding of baintree is now back for
 a couple of years many prairie we picked up gus the swede aburn fires started from the c p r
 locomotives and when we got to the fire we found showering sparks in a south west wind a number of
 men were already on the on the dry grass while going up the job one bunch fought the fire southgrade
 from namaka to strathmore the ward to the fire guard and we were to government authorities knew of the put
 it out northward to serviceberry many railway fires and in the 1890 s creek there wasn t much wind and
 all ploughed fire guards to keep them with went well until after midnight when we in boundaries one of the
 fire guards got our end under control there was still had its start at gleichen and ran north fire ncrth
 of the creek burning in the on the road allowance for about six sand hills but we left that part
 of the miles then westward to eagle lake the fire to another gang to extinguish howother one to catch the
 main shower of ever they never came and the fire burnt sparks had its start at around landgon slowly all
 night our next problem was and wont east to a point two miles north to find our way home as
 it was pitch ‘ l i ‘ before there was any grain growing prior t world war one the prairie
 country east calgary was the land of the great cattle herds this roundup crew is at work near gleiche black
 and the sky was full of smoke fire so she lost no time saddling up her rho north star was
 not visible and some horse and calling the stag hounds that one remarked that if we only had a com
 no one but she could handle a thoupass we would be well away at this sand feet of smoke rolled
 overhead but noint gus the swede said you don t the cattle were located in the smoke in need to
 gaze at the stars or a compass time to stampede them off to the side i am just as good
 as one youst follow after blowing all afternoon from the me to my place and in a couple of hours
 south west the big fire was struck by a the old red rooster will be in the pot change of
 wind of hurricane force that i asked gus what way he thought came in from the north west and by
 was east and i knew that he pointed sundown it fell off and saved the range land south of rosebud
 creek south like the charge of the light brigade we rode on into the jaws of a cold bobby powell
 of the dam ranch got night following gus and finally landed badly burnt in this fire trying to save back
 where we had left i laid down his team hitched to a california cart near a burning bush to get
 warm and he was driving the water cart for the get some sleep and when the sun came fire fighters
 when he was caught in the up in the west we knew that we had sudden change of wind he
 dropped become completely turned around we down in the bottom of the cart amid the went on to gus but
 had not slept very barrels of water but the heat began to long when we heard him yelling that bake
 him while trying to save his team the whole country was on fire under he was burnt about the hands
 and face a driving southwester the fire that had the straw filled collars on the horses not been put out
 on the north side of necks were burning and he ripped them serviceberry creek was on its way off with
 his bare hands one of the north east with smoke high in the air horses lived and bobby was taken
 to we had no time to eat and even though the hospital in calgary we had had a mush breakfast
 a few hours before it was not much after a the smoke and ashes of the big fire night s
 work and the red rooster was had just settled when a long caravan still at large of indian travois arrived
 at rosebud the fire had gone past the rocky they had smelled the roast beef and ford and was well
 on its way to the came to process it the larger band took george hope johnson s place but possession
 of jack cumming s pile of nothing could stop it as the wind was about sixty head that he had
 shot near blowing a gale the fire crossed the the dead man s slough the day after rosebud just west
 of johnson s and in a the fire the hides were removed and matter of an hour had consumed all
 of the insides taken out where the animal his hay all of jack cummings cattle lay the quartered meat was
 hauled were burnt to walking cinders and were to their camp on the north side of the ehot the next
 day the bashane ranch mile and a half slough where the bones ias burnt to the ground and they lost
 were removed from the meat this was a thousand dollar stallion a lot of cat loaded up and the bands
 returned to le were destroyed days after the fire the reserve on foot for once since the titer being found
 walking around burnt buffalo disappeared the indians had lots end blind near where rockyford is to of meat for winter
 lay jim wishart s four head of horses itched to a walking plow for backfiring after the indians moved out
 the cot burnt in a tangled up mess when the coyotes moved in by the hundreds i ‘ tind suddenly
 changed to the north have never seen so many they must vest the fire went to the red deer have
 come a long way there were still tiver and knee hill creek and on its a number of the now
 extinct buffalo ray it burnt up bob fitsimmons garden wolves running with the coyote packs hat he was just harvesting
 that winter i shot and poisoned over seventy five coyotes jean taylor wife of the ranch foreman or johnson saw
 the fire approaching thousands of cattle ran in the rosehe ranch about 600 head of johnson s bud district living
 most of the year withattle were right in the line of the head out being fed range cattle were tough
 and could rustle for a living in cold in their hides all vigar and i took thc winters and quite
 deep snow the grass hides off a lot of cattle at a dollar eacl was long and if sun cured
 before frost for jack morton and john creighton froze it the cattle would winter well while the carcasses were frozen
 the cows would have calves in april that hides came off easily with a crowbar axu had never seen a
 pound of hay the and large hammer the head and legu only animal that did not winter out too were
 not skinned along in february a well was the yearling steers most ran chinook blew for a few hours and
 just chers banked on open winters and chi enough snow melted to form an ice crust nooks taking off the
 snow they just put on the deep snow then a blizzard came up some hay to feed the calves and
 the up lasting for a day or so the ice crust odd animal that got too thin to winter cut
 the cattle s feet and legs until they a team and saddle horses were also bled and even our saddle
 horses legs kept in on feed and the milk cows ate got sore i rode the range nearly all winthe
 horse manure ter in a vain attempt to keep our cattle from drifting away i brought in a few rosebud
 ranchers in common with all to the feed lot but had very little hay the early cattlemen took long chances
 to feed cattle on the lift these cattle and lost out in the hard winters that had to be lifted
 up by the tail each day came along about once every decade and when the warm weather came they there
 has been so much said about the would not eat a bite and nearly all of hard winter of 1906
 07 that it seems them died a favorite place for the cathardly worthwhile for me to tell the tie to
 pile up was in the pot holes of same old story here looking back now small creeks the sheltered holes
 gave it is hard to realize what an ordeal the relief to the suffering animals until they ranchers faced what
 fortitude they had finally got away from it all in death i and what wonderful stamina the cattle found a
 hole one day that was full of had that lived all winter on brush and the dying animals so i
 mercifully destrees every bit of brush and the bark of troyed them small willows was all eaten by the starving
 animals we spent about a week skinning at morton s cx ranch in bitterly cold the winter started in the
 middle of weather a hundred or more lay in his the month of november and one storm feed lot and
 by the time we got finished followed another until the end of march another would be piled up we finally
 left as it was hopeless to keep up witi during this time it took jack morton the dying cattle after
 we finished at three days to move a herd of cattle john creighton s he sold the hides to u
 from his cx ranch to horse shoe can at a dollar a piece all and i decided yon a distance
 of 20 miles where there to load up our hides on two home madr were stacks of hay that he
 had bought sleighs and with a few coyote skins for from the homesteaders he made up a good measure we
 left for gleichen earl cavalcade of riders driving range horses in march it took ten hours to make thi to
 break a trail in the snow behind thirty odd miles and we walked mos them came a load of hay
 on bobsleighs of the way behind the sleighs to say hauled by four horses and strung out horse power in
 gleichen we sold the for half a mile behind were the cattle frozen assets to the butcher jack wi 1
 i think these animals wintered well in son for an average of 2 50 a hide the canyon ed ted
 kenny who came to rosebuc serviceberry creek and the severn in 1905 was a partner with dr sheet creek were
 the places where the most in the l cross ranch and lost a lot c cattle perished i started to
 make a rough cattle in the hard winter ted also rat estimate of the dead cattle in the severn about
 3 000 head for walter ross c creek starting from where rosebud is cardston they wore the yoke bar today
 in the first mile i counted 200 brand and ab out half were lost durin head but it proved too
 big a job in the the winter ted bought what was lef high water of spring the dead cattle of
 the yoke bars and the l cross went off downstream and those that interests in 1907 and made a real
 killint had died on the prairie just dried up on the deal cattle were cheap in the summer of st
 the north camp and i stayed with him 1907 because so many wanted to sell and my sister my job
 was to issue the out james lawson and sons took a big rations once a week and to line ride
 the loss in the winter so james went to the blackfoot reserve to keep the indian catbank to see about
 selling out and paying tle from straying away the last big part of his loan with what the cattle roundup
 i reped on was in 1911 at pat would bring the outstanding balance to burns circle ranch near queenstown he
 written off but the bank set him up when over 30 000 cattle went through with an interest free loan

 louie hong now of cluny and jack ranchers that were throwing in the monahan was the range boss he had
 sponge and grew rich in a few years only one hand but could rope horses or time cattle by holding
 the loose end of the rope under his arm jack morton bought the cs brand from his brother in law

 in the bottom of the wagon box grazing near the cutbank and to the side chile jack stood up steering
 the horses of a coulee that entered the bow river break neck speed over big hills and the indians would
 gather quietly and own the valleys until the buyer said with oiled ropes run a ring of fire around e
 had enough and wanted to get out the buffalo the animals stampeded to ick said to his passenger we re
 not get away from the fire jumping to their oing fast just watch the horses run death over the bank

 of the stone that it was recommended to the monuments board as a proper object to incorporate within monument they
 were about to make dave knew the indians very well first wli i having seen the blackfoot tribe in montana

 the indians away homesteader s yarn truly wonders will never cease a recently established homesteader from an eastern city purchased
 a female mule and was informed at the time that mules bred in alberta would propagate their own species each
 day he looked with grave expectancy for the little muley and was not surprised when going to the pasture that
 his wondering eyes beheld the little prodigy skipping about with glee but on nearer approach it became startled and all
 the endearing names he had learned at his mother s knee wouldn t stop it so he started in pursuit
 after a three mile run he espied a neighboring farmer coming his way and directly in line with the baby
 muley stop him stop him he cried head him there but muley seemed to have a head of his own
 so the farmer came on until face to face with the pursuer he was greeted with direful looks of revenge
 as between gasps the fellow asked why he didn t stop his little muley why replied the farmer with a
 tantalizing grin that wasn t no mule that was a jack rabbit it is said the fellow now wishes to
 swap his mule for a shotgun lethbridqe herald dec 29 1908 snovvbound by william english i editor s note mr

 successful one to date at the benton s mackid executive meeting in the afternoon there was a good representation from
 cal with the 54 th year of our society gary lethbridge and edmonton life now behind us it would seem
 that this might be an opportune time to stop the 1961 executive of the society and take stock for it
 is apparent that elected include there is at long last some evidence of president henry g ward edmonton an awakening
 of interest on things historical this interest is most apparent vice president rev j e nix calgary in the united
 states and i am hopeful secretary w l jacobson lethbridge that we can spark a little of that enthusiasm on
 our own behalf but in treasurer james g macgregor edmonton order to do so we must work at it and
 calgary representative j d middlemass not wait for it to develop on its own edmonton representative dr j w chalmers
