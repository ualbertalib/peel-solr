 sorensen married margaret creighton after a courtship that included some poignant letters alberta history i winter 2005 tn the mid
 i 920 s my father john from dorchester ontario to the carnrose sorensen came from denmark first to area in
 1902 he farmed there until 1932 ithe united states and then to canada when the bank foreclosed on his farm
 he eventually he found his way to the peace may not have been a very good manager as river country
 of alberta where he was told my mom admitted years later but it was a he would find good land
 that would produce terrible shock nevertheless it was a shock wonderful crops he d be rich in no time he
 and a disgrace creightons just didn t do was assured and that is exactly what things like that happened he
 was rich in no time never to be exact but he made a good life of it years later when
 morn was in a long term anyway care facility in calgary she saw a real estate sign rr toole peet
 cote and she gasped the trouble was he needed a wife a guy that was the name on the letter
 that had needed a girl to succeed in this come so many years ago to announce their homesteading business and
 there weren t loss the shock and disgrace of it all crossed many single in northern alberta at that time
 her face again enter the creighton family obviously grandpa creighton couldn t my grandfather kennedy creighton nioved afford already developed
 land so he chose to do what young men were doing all over the an apology for his writing margi
 the west he d get a homestead his son fred writing is ajob lain not very good at and not
 was homesteading in northern alberta so he much use to long ago i being wanted to decided he d go
 there at the time the peace write but then i thought mebi you did not river country was being touted
 as the last wanted me to but as you see i am doing it best west where a quarter section
 of anyway then he writes about the weather homestead land cost only 10 grandpa still the threshers who have not
 yet come to do had that much so like the babes in the his crop the firewood he has amassed
 the woods grandpa aged 70 and grandma never ending chores then he mentions a aged 65 moved lock stock and
 barrel to a dance held recently in dixonville i was wooded area of 160 acres north of peace wishing you
 hvere dere wishing you where river near the town of dixonville they had with me but mebi later you will
 will you no house no cleared land ready for crops no he signs a simple john well no garden no
 nothing two weeks later he writes on monday but they still had two daughters with them carl and i will
 be going to peace river for ruth and margaret both unmarried both the court in other words he and his
 other trained school teachers and both good brother were going down to get the final looking and capable they might
 as well papers for their land they had complied have been gold that wasn t the only reason with the
 regulations that there should be a that the predominantly male population of house and a certain amount of land cleared
 the area came to call and to dig the well for cultivation then lie adds don t be help build
 the house and clear the land but afraid of correcting my leite i like i f you it helped it
 certainly helped will and remember dear little margaret that i will be in gri nshaw anytine you wish ruth was
 captured first by my dad s to take you home just let me know always brother albert he always was
 a go getter so yours john he wasted no time and in 1933 he and his new wife established themselves
 in a log there s a fairly major leap here dear house about 2 1 2 miles from her folks
 little margaret in brackets but what margaret in the meantime was off teaching woman could resist being called dear or
 school in various one room school houses little smart man my dad around dixonville but because there were so few
 cars and no roads she might as well in his next letter he announces that he s a have been
 in timbuktu canadian farmer now all the court proceedings in peace river went just fine so if dad was going
 to court margaret and he s concerned that the threshing hasn t he was he was going to have to
 write been done yet it s december 3 high time letters he d been in america for about eight that
 threshing be done still he s pretty years so he spoke english more or less but cheerful and signs his
 letter atfid din he couldn t write it very well especially to a which means something like forever school teacher
 who might laugh at his yours in english mom wouldn t have efforts still what were his choices he had
 known that but the words look heartfelt to take a chance so with a dictionary by his somehow just two
 short words at the bottom side he began his campaign writing of his carefully crafted message in english practice letters
 in rough first and then morn s next letter ends with a sincerely a rewriting them in good he had
 a good hand nice enough idea but not nearly as promising the little schooling he had in denmark as atfid
 din however by march 9 of the certainly taught him a beautiful script but following year she s writing love
 at the the intricacies of the english language were end of her letters there s no explanation as to trip
 him up again and again to why this happened but it s possible that she was home with her morn
 and dad during the first letter in the collection is dated the months of december january and november 10 1933
 and dad starts off with february since schools didn t open their alberta history winter 2005 doors in the coldest
 part of winter it would get surprised every time i see that have been too dangerous for the kids to
 magnitude is that word right you bet it is travel back and forth too difficult to keep the dad not
 many people would have used that schoolhouse and teacher warm so mom particular word but any newborn baby has may
 have been with her parents long enough magnitude for dad to visit and to get a few words in edgewise
 there s certainly a more familiar dad admits in this letter that he s started tone in the next few
 letters indeed by april smoking again mom responds a week later 29 mom is comfortable enough to begin and establishes
 her lifelong pattern she correcting dad s letters bawls him out dear johnnie cried when i read your letter you
 know why just a little you write a very good letter my dear only hope and just a little love
 died then i had it is not long enough it is much more correct begun to think my best pal
 had real will than your first ones and you seemn to power and could say no not that it is
 such remember any corrections i ve told you an important matter but i f he can t govern these are
 some of the mistakes you did himself in little things how can he when it make though in spelling comes
 to bigger more important things crieghton should be creighton still she signs it love from margie mebi should be maybe
 nerly should he nearly dad still has a chance but then in his very vent should be went next letter
 he hints at an even bigger secret tonaight am feling kind of wek toward and the closing is again love
 dad is you i guis i could talk and tell you thinks doing just fine by the sounds of things
 by tonight i amn sad what for i don t just know may 4 he signs a letter good night
 dear but i think jam now good i haven t being as and he underlines dear good night tl tii
 honest to you as i should because i love you alone and i don t want to hurt you he
 signs by may 4 he is apologizing for his bad himself simply john no love atfid spelling and says he
 really doesn t have time din to write a practice letter first then copy it out in good i think
 i will quit that and just in a postscript he adds i should burn this write the one letter to
 you he says then he letter mebi but i vont don t take it up in the gets back to
 business but margie what very worst way about the 24 of may are you coming home i like if you
 could and i hope i i m reading these letters seventy years after won t be busy but i much

 in the peace states but eventually reports got to him that country are light for a long time and the
 air clara had had lots of boyfriends and he was is soft they re the best those june evenings being

 about dad s bottom line is she took a chance and past all along remember the last letter when married
 the guy together they were he said i haven t being as honest to you as magnitudes there s no
 other word for it i should after he wrote that letter he must have gone to pick her up on
 the last day of school in juite 1934 he couldn t have said anything on the ride home because faithful
 nancy millar grew up in the peace neighbour emory the only man with a car in river country and now

 later after the chores were done host newspaper columnist and is the he walked to the creighton home two ittiles
 author of six books on canada s past away mebi he talked mom into a stroll to gold bricks the
 first gold bricks ever brought out of the upper peace river country passed through edmonton oit wednesday under the charge
 of j c ellis who is operating a gold dredge above fort st john the machine was running for forty
 days and put through between sixty and seventy thousand cubic yards of gravel mr ellis would not state the valuation
 of the two bricks in question nor say what the estimated value of gold per cubic yard in the bank
 was after a visit to winnipeg he is going back into the fort st john area and will work the
 crew until november 15 if possible mr ellis was accompanied by pa luther representing allis machinery and american capital he
 said that undoubtedly the north country possessed many mining propositions and he would possibly recommend several to his principles upon
 his return to the states as a dredge expert he thought it was possible to make a handsome profit on
 working banks that showed only twenty cents per yard provided the properties were large enough to accommodate the required number
 of machines in making this statement mr luther said that transportation difficulties may be as bad as the north country
 possesses and still twenty cent gravel would pay the party went in before the ice was out they started out
 with four horses and finished with thirteen at times the entire number was hitched to one wagon in order to
 get the vehicle through the almost bottomless morasses that they negotiated edmonton bulletin october 13 1922 alberta history winter 2005

 maintain the railway tracks the by arrangement for housing for the section foreman was similar to that of the station
 jim george agent the building of the railways was essential to the position of station agent was a the development
 of the canadian west prestigious one and the bidding competition was keen when positions became available trains carried settlers effects
 from eastern he was an important person in the canada or from the united states and community at least equal
 to that of the carried their farm produce to markets every postmaster the druggist the bank manager seven to ten
 miles which was the distance the policeman the doctor or the school horses could travel and return in one day
 principal in most small towns in pioneer towns were started along the newly days there was only one person in
 each of constructed lines the above positions the station agent had to be a very responsible man with the lives
 of at each town the railway company so many passengers and train crew canadian pacific canadian national depending on his
 ability to supply pertinent canadian northern or grand trunk pacific information and data to those responsible for erected a building
 called the station running the trains as well as those riding on where the station agent supervised the them coming
 and going of innumerable items of merchandise normally he and his family station agents were telegraphers receiving lived in t
 he s t a t io n and paid a very nominal and sending t elegrams b y morse code
 a rent sometimes as little as 5 00 per month means of sending messages by using a with heat and
 water supplied the cpr paid variation of dots and dashes for each letter of its agents 2 00 per month
 for cleaning the the alphabet it was the principal means of station including washing the windows and communication up and
 down railway lines floors they were also expected to keep the as well as a means of quickly sending grounds
 clean and lawns or gardens in good messages between individuals it took a very shape the railway company also good
 operator to send these dots and dashes constructed a house for the section so accurately that the person on the
 receiving a telegraph key and clock are two important objects seen inside this railway station in the 1880 s the
 station was in the rocky mountains along the main line of the canadian pacific alberta history winter 2005 d end
 had no doubts about the message this platform detach the message and throw the skill was what set the station
 agents apart hoop back to the ground as quickly as from other workers possible the agent of course had to
 walk down the track for whatever distance it took when he received messages he phoned or and recover the hoop
 for the next use delivered them to the local customers or mailed the out of town ones he collected the
 this process was followed if there was a costs of telegrams and reported these to the message or a train
 order for a particular company all reports were sent by express in train the station agent turned on the train
 brown envelopes which were sealed with a order signal which required the train to type of hard wax the station
 agent would stop for the message or order this was also send money orders at customers delivered to the engineer
 by means of the requests many of the customers had charge hoop a copy was also hooped up to the
 accounts and these billings had to be mailed conductor if either the engineer or the regularly the station agent had
 to prepare a conductor missed catching the hoop they balance sheet of all moneys collected and if it had to
 stop the train and back up for the was out by one cent or more he had to re message
 as it usually told them where they check until the error was found had to meet another train during the
 two world wars many station each morning the station agent received a agents were called upon to instruct the report
 on the trains that would be travelling military in the use of telegraph codes for past his station that day
 he would pass this this purpose they used the continental code information along to the section foremen so whose technical
 differences from the morse they could arrange work schedules for track code made it somewhat easier to learn also maintenance
 crews for each working day during war time station agents were often called upon to be on the lookout for
 strange station agents also were express agents parcels coming to people in the vicinity who keeping track of a great
 variety of express might be suspected of being sympathetic to items coming and going the agent had to enemy nations
 should such a parcel come collect express costs for items being sent directed to a person on the list the
 agent prepaid as well as those coming in was to contact the rcmp immediately and collect generally he received a
 hold that parcel for inspection then a percentage of that express money all the decision would be made whether or
 not to money had to be accounted for and reported deliver the parcel weekly to the railway company he also
 had to arrange for the local delivery of groceries the station agents had a variety of other mail and hundreds
 of parcels that came in duties and responsibilities they sold tickets on the train he did this by calling on
 the to passengers made reservations arranged drayman who worked on a commission the for berths and even sold tickets for
 passage drayman was a familiar figure in all towns on steamship lines owned by the railway with his sturdy horses
 and flat bed wagon company they also had to keep track of all this position later drifted into oblivion monies
 received for tickets the station agents worked with the grain another task was to receive and pass on elevator agents
 ordering grain cars as messages to train conductors or engineers needed and when the cars were loaded the often by
 use of a hoop which was standard station agent typed up bills of lading for equipment in each station the
 message was them so the cars would be hauled to their typed out attached to the hoop which was proper
 destinations all cars once spotted made of wood about six feet long with a for loading were given a definite
 time to loop on one end about fifteen inches in load or unload if they went beyond this diameter the
 agent held the hoop up in such time they were assessed a demurrage a position that the engineer could stick
 his charge which the station agent collected arm through it as the train passed the station he also kept track
 of all railway cars set out alberta history winter 2005 at his station whether for storage purposes or if ordered
 by elevator operators and prepared a monthly report of all cars loaded and shipped out adding up all their weights
 and the charges assessed reporting the total weight was important as each engine could handle only so many tons the
 station agent sent any messages to the chief dispatcher from the train crews or from the section foreman regarding hazards
 to watch for or putting slow orders in place so that train crews could be warned where the rail bed
 was unstable or where there might be important work projects under way the agent also received messages from the chief
 dispatcher for the section foreman such as information on special trains or any number of other requirements at 11 00
 am each day a time check was wired from mcgill university the station agent had to set the station clock
 and ensure its accuracy within ten seconds this accuracy was depended upon by many of the townspeople who would phone
 the station to get the correct time immediately after the daily time check the station agent wired all stations any
 rush messages of company business and or job opportunities even with all of these and other responsibilities many station agents
 were active in their communities participating in local sports such as curling or baseball or becoming involved in local politics
 as times changed and the trucking industry gradually took over the transporting of small freight items more efficient means of
 commu n ica t ion i e telep hone and radio rendered telegraphy obsolete the position of the station agent
 was phased out by the late 1960 s or early 1970 s the position disappeared entirely many of the small
 town stations were sold and renovated for other uses or were moved to museums where the story of their heyday
