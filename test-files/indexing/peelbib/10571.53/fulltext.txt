 3 colonel ln chief princess patricia s canadian light infantry the countess mountbatten of burma cd jp dl message from 
 the colonel ln chief the year 1990 was one which brought with it a change over of colonels of the 
 regiment from brigadier general r s graham cd to major general h c pitts mc cd this is always a 
 momentous event in regimental history when the time comes to change the very important lather figure who has such far 
 reaching influence on all regimental matters in my sixteen years as colonel in chief i have been privileged to work 
 very closely with all four of our colonels of the regiment since our founder brigadier general hamilton gault i know 
 them to be remarkable patricias totally dedicated to the well being of our regiment with their high sense of duty 
 and the wisdom of wide experience i would like to pay a special tribute to general graham for the way 
 he overcame a very severe illness during his appointment and was able to resume his duties eventually against all the 
 odds a remarkable display of courage and determination which we all greatly admired we are especially indebted to him for 
 this and the leadership and example he gave us i do want also to thank his wife betty for the 
 tremendous support she has been to him and for her help in contacts with the regiment which has been much 
 appreciated to our new colonel of the regiment major general pitts we extend a very warm welcome and we know 
 that he will in every way uphold the very high standards set by his predecessors the year 1990 was also 
 the 75th anniversary of the raising of the loyal edmonton regiment our fourth battalion i was so pleased to be 
 able to attend the excellent and varied events arranged for this important celebration and was very impressed by them all 
 and the high standards achieved it is good to know that we all form part of the same regiment of 
 which i am very proud to be colonel in chief 
 4 colonel of the regiment princess patricia s canadian light infantry major general h c pitts mc cd message from 
 colonel of the regiment this will be my first opportunity to greet all patricias serving and retired through the patrician 
 and it gives great pleasure to send all of you best wishes since i succeeded brigadier general stu graham as 
 your colonel in october of 1990 much has happened in the international field canada is once again in early 1991 
 a member of the united nations coalition against aggression in the persian gulf it was often said that another korean 
 war would not take place yet again we find ourselves engaged in an effort like korea to turn back an 
 aggressor from the territory taken from a neighbor as a regiment we are not yet involved but that does not 
 mean that during the course of operations or its aftermath we will not be committed as ever the patricias stand 
 ready to answer any call in peace or in war our world is not the stable place we hoped it 
 would be in the heady days of late 1989 and 1990 nationally and internationally tensions are being felt and fostered 
 which will demand the highest possible professional response from canada s soldiers we are peacemakers and peacekeepers and our skills 
 and confidence will be much in demand the future will be full of challenges as various scenarios unfold but in 
 them will be opportunities my few visits so far to various components of the regiment confirm that our country s 
 trust is well placed in those of you now carrying our colours we who have travelled through our careers in 
 the service and now watch the serving soldiers know that you will acquit yourselves well to the credit of your 
 country your regiment and yourselves you have our support and our admiration best regards to all of you in the 
 future i look forward to greeting you personally in the years ahead

 manitoba r2m 5j5 message from the national president it is fitting that i begin by expressing the association s feeling 
 of loss in the sudden death in september in the second year of office of our president leslie basham a 
 man of terrific energies and a forceful desire to see that all was right and progressive in the affairs of 
 not only the association but of the regiment as a whole colonel basham had an exemplary army career from cadet 
 to chief of staff of pacific command which included that of director of infantry and command of 1 ppcli it 
 was natural for all of us to feel a little counter reaction after the events of our 75th anniversary i 
 believe nevertheless the association pulled off a most successful and enjoyable annual general meeting in winnipeg at kapyong barracks hosted 
 by the manitoba and nw ontario branch the gathering of delegates 0:dele 0:gates visitors and branch members showed that patricias 
 as always can put on a good show i would like at this time to express our special appreciation for 
 the support given by 2 ppcli to the success of our agm and in particular to major eckley and mwo 
 ogilvie and the cooperation of the 2 ppcli wo s and sgt s mess all was done in patricia style 
 nineteen ninety saw too the completion and dedication by the colonel in chief of the regiment s hall of honour 
 within the museum this was entirely an association project conceived and carried to completion 0:comple 0:tion by one person rod 
 middleton president 1984 89 he designed raised the money and oversaw the completion of the project the association thanks all 
 ranks of the serving regiment for their generous contributions 0:con 0:tributions to the project i believe you will be proud 
 of what has been achieved and i sincerely hope that all members of the regiment will have an opportunity at 
 some time to stand in this place of remembrance to those patricias who fell contributing to the prowess of the 
 regiment i have a final message and this concerns the continuance of the association it rests not with the present 
 0:pre 0:sent membership but with the active serving members the future of the association is in the hands of those 
 who now serve with the colours one aim of the association is to preserve the comradeship and clan of being 
 a patricia do not however look upon it as just an old comrades association the association s mission is a 
 membership that continues to serve the regiment and we rely upon all patricias for the association s future

 11 captain rudy raidt mmm cd regimental adjutant retires captain r raidt will retire from the canadian armed forces in 
 september 1991 after a long and august career of service to the ppcli captain raidt joined the regiment as a 
 private recruit in edmonton alberta in june 1959 upon completion of basic training he was posted to delta coy 2nd 
 battalion which was at that time located in edmonton he was then posted to germany where he was promoted to 
 cpl in oct 1966 and to sgt in april 1970 upon his return to canada more specifically the 2nd battalion 
 in winnipeg he held various jobs in the unit from pi sgt to pi comd until 1973 when he was 
 promoted to warrant officer and employed as cqms he was commissioned to the rank of lt in 1975 posted to 
 edmonton as area cadet officer and subsequently to winnipeg manitoba as adjutant of the queen s own cameron highlanders of 
 canada in 1978 he was promoted to captain and in 1980 was posted back to the 2nd battalion as 2ic 
 of c coy and combat support company in july of 1982 he was posted to ppcli regimental headquarters in calgary 
 alberta where he began his career as regimental adjutant as the regimental adjutant he proved to be the right man 
 for this demanding job indeed a better man could not have been chosen for this multi faceted position captain raidt 
 s tireless and persistent commitment to the job at hand has been evident through the years concern for anddedication to 
 the regiment has always been first and foremost on his agenda one would be hard pressed to enumerate all of 
 captain raidt s accomplishments the maintenance accounting and operation of the regimental and association funds and accounts was but one 
 of the challenges he faced in his nine year tenure as regimental adjutant one day saw him as curator of 
 the regimental museum the next as secretary of the ppcli association or aide de camp to the colonel of the 
 regiment he became the corporate memory of the regiment in addition to his regimental duties he was involved in the 
 civilian community he is a prominent member of the alberta museum association and plans to continue his activities in this 
 domain after retirement in june 1986 captain raidt s hard work and unstinting dedication were officially recognized and he was 
 invested as a member of the order of military merit a fitting tribute to his professionalism captain raidt is retiring 
 in september 1991 after 32 years of distinguished service we take this opportunity to wish rudy and his wife marlene 
 all the best and happiness upon retirement 
 12 a mess loaded with spirits text by lt jean morissette photos by ed dixon plaque that can be seen 
 on the 3 ppcli officers bronze plaque dedicated to the royal canadian artillery who built the mess in 1892 acknowledgment 
 to lcol retired doug nelson and cmd retired peter gardner who contributed greatly to the production of this article like 
 it or not everyone has an inner fear of the unknown even the most sceptical are unwilling to spend a 
 night alone in a place which has the reputation 0:repu 0:tation of being haunted i know very well that what 
 you are about to read will be considered by some of you as a big joke nonsensical but for others 
 when they are talking about the officers mess at work point barracks in esquimalt british columbia they are as serious 
 as they can be their eyes become big and round as they recall events surrounding these quarters jeering comments while 
 they are relating their experiences or those of others are not welcome the point is that according to many officers 
 mainly from those who used to belong or still belong to the 3rd battalion princess patricia s canadian light infantry 
 3 ppcli their mess is haunted many have had strange experiences which cannot be fully explained is it true fact 
 folklore or spirits this article will not tell you but one thing is sure after reading it you will ask 
 yourself if you would like to spend a night i rather doubt you will be able to sleep in this 
 building a brief history of the building this two storey building was built in 1892 for the members of c 
 battery of the royal canadian artillery many units have rotated through there and in 1970 3 ppcli took possession of 
 the building for many years the end of the building closest to the water was occupied by the commanding officer 
 and his family today those quarters are being used as single officers quarters it is in this area of the 
 building where most of the weird phenomena 0:phe 0:nomena are supposed to have taken place according to the majority of 
 people who have been in this mess the walls and ceiling constantly creak and make a variety of noises another 
 interesting point about this edifice which is by the way officially called work point barracks officers mess for those interested 
 a little history prior to 1977 this building was named the george r pearkes building which is incidentally the same 
 name as that of our national defence headquarters in ottawa events that have taken place many strange events have taken 
 place over the years in this particular mess occasionally some of the living in members have seen objects moving or 
 have found electrical appliances switched on or off during their absence or a green smoke coming out of the heating 
 pipes perhaps the most common phenomenon according 0:accord 0:ing to many people has been the balls on the pool table 
 moving by themselves when absolutely no one was around also many officers have left their room for a short period 
 of timewith lights radio tv turned off but when they returned they were all turned on weird wouldn t you 
 say 
 13 after witnessing such an experience a resident captain decided to make sure it was no a joke he searched 
 around his room convinced somebody was just trying to make fun of him his conclusion nobody was around or could 
 have opened my door so it was impossible for me to explain how it happened but others have had scarier 
 experiences one of them is commander retired peter gardner who lived with his family in the east end of the 
 building for a little more than three years 1977 80 before i moved into that building i had heard about 
 the ghost rumours but i didn t pay too much attention maybe because i thought it was only a joke 
 this is how everything started for this former 0:for 0:mer member of the canadian forces who quickly realized that there 
 must may be some substance to the rumours a few months after he and his family had settled in his 
 mother in law who is psychic came to visit the family as soon as she arrived at our home she 
 told us there was something mysterious about our house an inexplicable presence inside because of her fear for the entire 
 time she spent with us she never used the main hall with a smile he added that she even preferred 
 to use the front door to go to the backyard in order to avoid the hallway myself i was a 
 little nervous for example at night time if i had to go to or pass through the dining 0:din 0:ing 
 room i always turned the lights on just to be on the safe side it may sound weird to say 
 that but my wife and i could feel that the presence was a sympathetic one on many occasions this family 
 experienced mysterious 0:myste 0:rious occurrences a few times they saw the spectre 0:spec 0:tre of a young boy running in 
 the tv room on three different occasions each separated by a year in the middle of the night he smelled 
 a fire each time they woke up their children and the other people in the mess but each time there 
 was no fire perhaps the most intriguing event that took place in the gardner s house happened in november 1979 
 when anne his wife saw in the middle of the hight an old man wearing a high necked blue tunic 
 talking to a young boy dressed in a night shirt i can t believe it she told me she was 
 not even scared she simply made sure she wasn t dreaming and she fell asleep again how she did that 
 i don t know but for sure she is better than i am said the retired officer another officer experienced 
 incredible moments in that same part of the building he is a former member of 3 ppcli who stayed many 
 years in the building and who prefers to keep his anonymity for obvious reasons according to him the officers mess 
 is truly haunted his conviction is based on his own experiences with the supernatural one night he awakened to see 
 an apparition of two ghosts for over 15 minutes he watched the ghosts standing at the end of his bed 
 and they seemed to be in deep conversation here is what happened during the evening of the 8 or 9 
 november 1982 the officers and the non commissioned officers of the battalion had to attend a social meeting in the 
 warrant officers and sergeants mess around 2130 hours after i had only one beer so believe me i was not 
 under the influence of alcohol he said with insistence i decided to return to my room which was located on 
 the second floor at the east end of the mess which is the same one where mrs gardner experienced her 
 incredible manifestation i made a quick phone call to my parents and soon after went to bed and fell asleep 
 almost immediately 0:immediate 0:ly after a small pause his tone changed as he continued around 0315 or 0415 hours i 
 suddenly 0:sudden 0:ly woke up something weird that i couldn t explain at that time was happening somebody was in 
 my room he said with all seriousness in the world first i thought i was the victim of a good 
 joke by my comrades but that was not the case i then realized that these people were all dressed in 
 white so i thought it was two men from construction engineering but at this time of the night as i 
 said previously my room was located on the second floor so i never use my curtains therefore it was relatively 
 bright in the room at this stage of the discussion his voice level changed and with emphasis he continued after 
 a little while i was fully awake and i saw a man behind my sofa who was talking but i 
 couldn t hear anything he was wearing an old military uniform similar to the one presently worn at our military 
 colleges which is also a high neck tunic the ghost was all the same colour white almost transparent in some 
 spots and opaque in others he said i could only see half of his body but lam sure that he 
 was relatively 0:rel 0:atively tall i was struck dead in my bed all the stories that i had heard about 
 those ghosts in that specific area of the mess and that i had laughed about 
 14 happened to be true the proof was right in front of me he mentioned with emotion i then turned 
 my head slightly and saw the person the ghost was talking to it was a little boy about ten years 
 old he was wearing a night shirt i couldn t believe what i was seeing i carefully looked all around 
 my room was in order i really was in my own place after about 15 minutes i decided to get 
 out of bed while i was walking toward the light switch the ghosts continued to talk as if nothing was 
 bothering them but as soon as i turned the lights on that was it no more ghosts i went to 
 see my neighbours to check if they had seen anything no i was the only one the following nights i 
 hardly slept and i kept my lights on after a couple of weeks i asked for another room not so 
 much because i was scared contrary to what my friends at the time believed but because i wanted a bigger 
 one where by the way nothing ever happened today when this officer recalls this incredible event one thing bothers him 
 that the idea to attempt to communicate with those spirits did not come to his mind after hearing about the 
 experience of the above officer which had taken place in november 1982 lieutenant colonel don brodie deputy commander of the 
 canadian forces base calgary who was then the deputy commander of 3 ppcli became curious he started to collect data 
 on the numerous events which were said to have taken place he also tried to pinpoint the exact date of 
 each event this is why in november 1983 he was ready to encounter anything exactly one year plus one day 
 later none of the officers living in that mess were able to fall asleep they felt there was a disquieting 
 presence during the night he said with seriousness two very weird coincidences don t you think the exact same ghosts 
 wearing the exact same dress even if each apparition was separated by many years and both happened in the same 
 room weird very weird so is that mysterious night when nobody could fall in the arms of morpheus possible explanations 
 a few explanations can be used to solve partly some of those mysterious phenomena but many are still unsolved of 
 course the easiest explana tion would be to say that everything is a tradition passed among the regiments that have 
 been located there but all the victims are strongly maintaining 0:main 0:taining the opposite the billiard balls moving by themselves 
 on the pool table could be explained by the frequent earthquakes 0:earth 0:quakes that british columbia experiences but how about 
 those balls that are rolling very fast in one publication released on the history of the base it is stated 
 at a certain point while commenting 0:comment 0:ing on the fact that there are ghosts in the officers mess a 
 check into company records found that an old man had committed suicide and a young boy had also been killed 
 they had resided in the room according to lcol retired doug nelson cfb esquimalt historian in digging in the units 
 records we find that some members of that officers mess committed suicide or were killed during the last 100 years 
 one of the most recent suicides happened in the early 19605 also one american in uniform even committed suicide with 
 a gun in front of the building in 1947 he continued the two year old son of an artillery officer 
 who s family lived in the east end of the mess was struck down by a delivery 0:deliv 0:ery truck 
 and killed just beside the building the possibility that this child or another that i haven t been able to 
 track as well as one of the adults who committed suicide or were killed could be the actual ghosts who 
 are frightening the occupants of the mess is very possible especially since ghosts by definition are the spectres of dead 
 persons appearing to the living if the only point that is bugging you is the fact that the adult ghost 
 is wearing a high neck uniform then you should know that both the british and canadian armies prior to 1970 
 used to wear a similarly styled patrol dress commonly called blues the ever increasing evidence surrounding these events serves to 
 enhance the beliefs of the existence 0:exis 0:tence of the supernatural there will always be the doubting thomas but for 
 myself and many others 0:oth 0:ers there exists a definite uncertainty in our minds are these incidents a result of 
 the supernatural folklore coincidence now you know all the facts about this officers mess and with your previous knowledge of 
 spirits you should now be able to make your own judgement 0:judge 0:ment on whether it is true or false

 16 research of the poem ric a dam doo by wo g f collins for the past seventy some odd 
 years the words ric a dam doo have been one of the most regimentally 0:regi 0:mentally used yet least understood 
 phrases in our vocabulary it is the intention of the regimental museum to offer yet one more twist to the 
 story but in doing so i also intend to continue in my search to find conclusive 0:con 0:clusive evidence to 
 finally lay this subject to rest we will give a brief history as how i believe the evolution of the 
 poem began it is important therefore 0:there 0:fore to realize that this is merely a theory based on existing documentation 
 in the beginning prior to the regiment leaving for england it was given a camp colour that had been hand 
 made by princess patricia of connaught during the period of 1914 1915 there was no historical information that the colour 
 was being called the ric a dam doo however in 1916 this was to change in the diary of captain 
 mcfarlane there is a poem written in the first days of june 1916 it was called the rig a dam 
 do this poem is the first written version known to exist however we are convinced that the author was not 
 mcfarlane himself but he was as far as we can determine the first to copy it down it has been 
 the view for many years that the phrase ric a dam doo was of gaelic origin we at the museum 
 tend to agree with that sentiment as a great many of the originals were of scottish descent the following is 
 what i think may have given birth to that phrase a scottish member of the regiment for some reason 0:rea 
 0:son nicknamed the colours it is our belief that the phrase caught on but before many others were to know 
 its meaning the originator was killed or wounded and shipped home this we think is the reason why the meaning 
 for the phrase has been lost shortly after the term was used and accepted by the men a poem was 
 written version one the key to dating this poem is found in verse 5 6 and 7 verse five mentions 
 company number four and verse six mentions the words oh donald is our major dear verse seven gives the col 
 as h c 8 in june of 1916 captain donald gray was given the temporary rank of major and was 
 in command of number four company the commanding officer 0:offi 0:cer at the time was col h c buller old 
 h c b our colonel grand what now remains to be seen is how the phrase got changed from rig 
 a dam do to ric a dam doo probably the best way to explain this is to say that someone 
 heard the poem then wrote his own versions of rig ric rik rick if you say the word rig in 
 your best scottish tongue you will find that it comes out as ric so in conclusion i believe that the 
 original phrase was in fact rig a dam do and we will give further evidence on this shortly other versions 
 of the poem can be dated by the line about the colonel grand ackity ack agar adamson charles s col 
 steward and in latter versions the added verses that comply with our history it is also important to note that 
 the poem was never really accepted in the early years because of its talk of officers and in its salacious 
 verses that were sacrilegious when spoken in the same breath of the colours in time the verses were cleaned up 
 even the point that the media would refer to the colour as the ric a dam doo it seemed destined 
 to be with us forever 0:for 0:ever so what does it stand for well we can find no answer for 
 ric a dam doo but the gaelic dictionary 0:dictio 0:nary gives us these slang words for the original version rig 
 a dam doo meaning uidheamaich a mathair gnathaich the literal translation is regimental uniform of the mother cross dress of 
 thy sign cloth his cypher or in acomprehensible manner regimental cloth of thy mothers cypher i humbly deduct from this 
 that the cloth is the colour made by the mother of the regiment lady patricia and that the cross or 
 sign stands for her initials or cypher that are sewn in the center of the colour

 18 exercise nordic warrior exercise nordic warrior was conducted from 4 18 january 1990 in a remote area of british 
 columbia known as the chilcotin the exercise was used as a test exercise for our upcoming amf l exercise in 
 north norway and in many ways it was a lot tougher than the exercise in norway the exercise was primarily 
 dismounted are as most of our amf equipment is pre positioned in norway however c company key company meaning that

 we also became very familiar with the building of snow defences and the use of military skis as the conditions 
 were ideal for them helicopter support was great as the two dismounted 0:dismount 0:ed companies were both given the opportunity

 in that the weather was almost too balmy the ski training itself consisted of four days of cross country training 
 and two days of downhill skiing the two days downhill were more or less a reward for the toil that 
 the students endured during the cross country ski training the cross country ski training included ski jorring long ski treks

 locals the concept of platoon exchanges is not new however the first battalion has not participated in this exchange since 
 1974 that was the last time it was the designated amf l battalion a position assumed again in 1989 essentially

 hospitality was unending if they could have bent over backwards they would have the first few days on the ground 
 were spent trying out norwegian weapons and equipment at the 3rd battalion s home base in asegarden near horstad a 
 two day exercise and several range practices were enlightening although norwegian tendencies to move forward of the firing point raised 
 a few eyebrows tours were laid on over most of north norway including narvik and troms of special interest was 
 a detailed tour of a coastal defence battery at maetovaels many of the best experiences were in the night clubs

 a bivouac companies deployed to practice a variety of skills company training encompassed combat team operations patrolling vehicle swimming and 
 an assortment of ranges including a section live fire assault range all this training led to a live fire combat 
 team attack for each company though the battalion concentrated on company training this in no way inhibited the battalion s 
 team work and the coordination necessary during the brigade exercise the first battalion prepared a number of defensive positions in 
 preparation for the anticipated enemy attack as well as for the reserve battalions which would soon arrive with guidance on 
 how to prepare each position no matter 0:mat 0:ter how small coming from all levels the battalion was easily able 
 to defeat the attacking enemy and had end ex not been called counter attacks would have allowed the first battalion 
 to commence offensive operations upon completion of the brigade exercise the battalion quickly regrouped in time to welcome the reserves 
 to wainwright each rifle company teamed up with a reserve company in bivouac for training with only a week available 
 the battalion ran a variety 0:vari 0:ety of training activities in a round robin these activities were at times marred 
 by the continuous rain and eventually caused the evacuation of the reserves to camp wainwright once dried out the reserves

 a result the corps has new administration offices quartermaster stores a classroom and washrooms in addition to it s present 
 quarters during the past year a parents association was formed to support and raise money for cadet activities 0:activi 0:ties

 38 d a year in the life of 3 ppcli to state that 1990 was a busy year for the 
 third battalion would be an understatement to say the least on return from christmas leave the battalion launched with the 
 fury of a runaway machine gun and never looked back but now as the spectre of the patrician deadline approaches 
 and we sift through the unit memory we can see in retrospect that 1990 was in fact a year to 
 remember 0:remem 0:ber ex snow seeker 90 as the name of the exercise implies the absence of snow in the 
 victoria area has always been a thorn in the side of any battalion member who has attempted to plan or 
 conduct winter warfare training on the island by adhering to the indispensable principle of flexibility the battalion was able to 
 conduct an effective expedient to travelling to the north in ex snow seeker 90 forbidden plateau was the site of 
 winter indoctrination 0:indoctri 0:nation and ski training in january 1990 the companies 0:com 0:panies practiced themselves in the rigors of 
 winter warfare despite what the second battalion might regard as mild conditions the four day exercise proved to be beneficial 
 as our soldiers honed their skills in tent group routine expedient shelters snowshoeing military skiing movement and snow defences a 
 touch of recreational skiing at the end of the exercise capped off a useful and enjoyable exercise pcf cycle in 
 february the battalion set about the task of conducting the annual primary combat function pcf cycle the widest possible range 
 of courses was conducted which included base reconnaissance patrolman tow gunner basic pioneer basic mortarman signals machine gunner driver avgp 
 driver wheel and combat storeman an excellent effort was extended by all ranks and the results achieved in all areas 
 of the training reflected the hard work of the battalion s soldiers this pcf cycle contributed greatly to enhancing the 
 operational effectiveness of the unit ex strong contender a brief pause was called in early february for the battalion to 
 send its athletes to calgary for the annual brigade sports competition ex strong contender during this exercise the battalion fielded 
 teams in ice hockey floor hockey broomball and volleyball it was a banner year for the third because for the 
 first time ever it won the ice hockey championship in con vincing fashion the victory was particularly sweet because the 
 third battalion islanders blasted the foundations of the second battalion rebels dynasty but as the soldiers of the third battalion 
 are above the pettiness of gloating we prefer not to dwell upon the sound thrashing that we handed out to 
 the second battalion in addition to our resounding hockey victory honourable mention must also go out to all the teams 
 particularly the broomball team which made it to the finals patrol school competition patrolling is an integral part of modern 
 warfare it is a means by which the infantry gains or denies critical information and objectives to or from the 
 enemy and is the pinnacle of infantry skill and training in the past this unit has placed a tremendous emphasis 
 on developing skills in patrolling and the year 1990 was certainly no exception in the last week of march the 
 battalion started a patrol school which was quickly 0:quick 0:ly followed by a unit patrol competition 3 ppcli 1990

 lonesome prairie of wainwright alta during what became know as the wainwright campaign the unit had both an eventful and 
 memorable summer the first order of business to be tackled at the outset 0:out 0:set of the campaign season can 
 be summed up in two words live fire ex prairie viper covered the full spectrum of ranges from individual closequarter 
 0:close 0:quarter battle lanes to company size assault and trench clearing ranges for three weeks the battalion developed its battlecraft 
 at every level the aim of ex prairie viper was to develop the fighting skills of the rifle companies accordingly 
 the platoons of cbt sp coy were tasked with the preparation and conduct of such ranges as jungle lanes pairs 
 fire and movement section assault platoon assault ambush and company assault their efforts were nothing short of excellent and all 
 range staffs should be praised of particular note was the superb trench clearing range constructed by pioneer platoon lt paynter

 in wainwright on 20 june the battalion as part of 1 cbg took part in ex lethal defender the battalion 
 was instrumental in seizing a bridgehead on the east bank of the battle river it set about creating a formidable 
 defence which successfully repelled attacks mounted by an aggressive and cunning enemy provided by the third battalion royal anglican regiment

 of the third battalion punished 0:pun 0:ished him by snuffing out several sniper detachments 0:detach 0:ments and capturing numerous prisoners 
 the hard work of april paid back dividends during this phase of the training in the final days of the 
 exercise the enemy hurled its remaining strength in a final offensive aimed at the heart of the 1 cbg bridgehead 
 the attack was repelled by stalwart defenses and a series of aggressive counter attacks which left the bridgehead 0:bridge 0:head 
 intact and defensible unfortunately the battalion suffered a very real casualty in the form of the commanding officer who was 
 unable to lead his battalion having succumbed to a serious illness however in the finest traditions of the regiment the 
 battalion continued to soldier on and achieve its mission effectively under the command of deputy commanding officer maj a j 
 flaman the fine performance of the unit without its commanding officer was a testament to lcol elliott s leadership and 
 the high standards of training 0:train 0:ing and discipline that were instilled during his tenure of command the final phase 
 of exercise on guard 90 saw the total force portion of integrated training of militia and regular force units an 
 event that was unique in training since the second world war the exercise 0:exer 0:cise began with a battle school 
 for the pacific strike battalion in which militia soldiers 
 41 participated in a variety of ranges including tank hunting pairs fire and movement and ambush ranges there then ensued 
 a relief in place which saw the third return to its bridgehead from ex lethal defender under the command of 
 lcol nette the pacific strike battalion then defended against unrelenting attacks from the third during the next two days when 
 the dust finally settled and the badly mauled militia units were allowed to withdraw everyone agreed that this exercise provided 
 0:pro 0:vided excellent training for all involved there were several other events of note in the memorable summer of 1990

 effort as they continue the tradition of winning at 3 ppcli ex quick otter during the early morning hours of 
 21 october a coy was bugged out in preparation for an operation in support of the local rcmp at 2100 
 hours that day lcol kenward issued orders which notified the company that they would be conducting a raid in the 
 jordan river area their targets a group of drug dealers and their lab the mission was a tricky one owing 
 to the ruggedness of the terrain and the need for a speedy silent approach it was decided to come by 
 way of the ocean using a combination of hmcs restigouche and assault boats to land the raiding force obviously this 
 required not only detailed coordination but thorough rehearsals to acquaint all the soldiers with the intricacies of this unfamiliar mode 
 of travel by 2000 hrs on 22 october all was ready and the troops disembarked from the ship and began

 to see the sights in and around one of the largest us bases on the west coast however many did 
 find the time to get a little shopping in just in time for christmas tired but brimming with confidence and 
 satisfaction each of the companies returned to work point better trained in their infantry skills ex poison dart from 26

 companies and support platoons 0:pla 0:toons fulfilling the lower control function 
 44 the scenario was a fast paced high intensity battle on a european model in which the blue forces took 
 to the offensive against those blasted fantasians the scope of the exercise was ambitious 0:ambi 0:tious as it included an 
 advance a passage of lines a river crossing and the defence of a bridgehead 0:bridge 0:head for the battalion headquarters 
 staff the exercise play provided ample opportunity to plan coordinate and execute in theory at least a wide variety of 
 tasks lt c allen mans the hotseat in c s 0 while pte s lafreniere listens in the nbc defense

 many thanks to the locon players who suffered the slings and arrows of battalion headquarters during the shake out process 
 military athletic competitions in keeping with its rigorous physical training program and to uphold the unit s reputation as the 
 most physically fit infantry battalion in the canadian army the unit held two weeks of competitions in december 1990 in 
 addition to the battalion s quarterly 400 point pt test of push ups sit ups chin ups and a two 
 mile run number of new and demanding competitions were instituted an advanced fitness test was created and promulgated 0:pro 0:mulgated 
 by the co in an attempt to pump us up he introduced the following events along with the standards for 
 a first class pass 1 four mile run 26 minutes 2 push ups 60 repetitions in 90 seconds 3 sit

 lb squat 15 repetitions the event was compulsory for all officers and at least 10 personnel from each company all 
 of whom found it to be a gruelling test of physical endurance this was due in part to the fact 
 that the run was the first event no doubt about it this one was a killer the strongman competition the 
 strongman competition pitted the battalion s strongest men against each other as the competition was proportioned 0:pro 0:portioned to body 
 weight the biggest man did not necessarily have an advantage events included bench press military press and dead lift individual 
 winners were as follows gold sgt gates b company silver pte waddell b company bronze ocdt pumphrey c company in

 the front steps of the ominous edifice there appeared a six foot brown bear with a tray full of drambuies 
 in his paws after the initial ponderance of this strange apparition the drinks were choked back in fairly short order 
 and in no time the parade of officers 0:offi 0:cers was making its way back to work point with a

 the thirteenth of december the battalion kicked back for a little fun and relaxation prior to departing on christmas leave 
 the annual officer s ys senior nco s hockey game was the first order of business as usual the officers 
 took it upon themselves 0:them 0:selves to give the senior nco s a lesson in the finer points of canada

 was only through placing a couple of ringers on the duffer line that the nco s were able to salvage 
 a 4 4 tie there can be no doubt sgt sarginson is no duffer not to worry this despicable and 
 unsportsmanlike behaviour has come to be expected from the nco s and the officers took it all in stride in 
 another fiercely contested match the cpl s and pte s took it to the mcpl s close checking and end

 in dissecting his christmas bird than attempting to re direct the battalion for 1991 it was all in good fun

 it the members of 2 commando are all volunteers selected from the finest patricia soldiers each member has made a 
 commitment to professionalism and excellence and has earned the right to wear the coveted maroon beret 1990 proved to be 
 an exciting year for 2 commando many good exercises were conducted 0:con 0:ducted which provided us with the opportunity to 
 refine age old infantry skills as well as to learn the airborne way the soldiers of 2 commando take advantage 
 of unique training opportunities not normally available to other infantry units and as 2 commando makes up a part of 
 the airborne battle group additional equipment and resources become available giving the airborne soldier a well rounded knowledge of all 
 arms combat the highlights of the year started right away in january when the commando had the opportunity to conduct 
 training with e battery para from 2 rcha and the regimental mortar platoon during exercise frost bite the training was 
 conducted in three phases the initial deployment saw the commando conducting range work to refamiliarize everyone with artillery and mortar 
 fire employment phase two began with an advance to contact clearing pockets of enemy resistance as night fell the commando 
 dug hasty defences and later staged a fighting withdrawal a super exercise tc kick off the new year still in 
 january 2 commando was pitted against 1 commando in an all out no holds barred patrolling competition the objective was 
 to capture the enemy flag from their headquarters after some heated patrolling from both sides neither came out winners and 
 the competition was declared tie february began with a stumble as a cross country ski refresher was conducted on bangy

 zero in the day to 25c at night a canadian signals regiment soldier won t soon forget the meaning of 
 the maroon beret as sgt gresty felt the young soldier might have some information of interest after a couple of

 rushed to construct fortified strongholds and other platoons then tried to take them away in what turned out to be 
 an excellent training ground for fighting in built up areas the remainder of may and into june took 2 commando 
 into the field to train militiamen on exercise on guard 90 tasked primarily with running militia companies through live fire 
 defensive 0:defen 0:sive stands proved most interesting for both 2 commando and the militia later in the exercise 2 commando 
 was employed patrolling against militia defensive positions surprisingly it is hard to see militiamen as they are hiding in fear 
 at the bottom of their trenches the annual posting season was a sad time for many as they said good 
 bye to the commando and moved on to other things big and small however with their departure came a new 
 group of fngs all with a look of worry on their faces and the fear in their hearts that maybe 
 they aren t good enough to wear the maroon beret time would tell with the summer months came exercise pegasus

 winter in what is commonly referred to as god s country after a record number of consecutive 0:consec 0:utive days 
 of rain last spring a scorching summer a wee bit of flooding after 40 days and nights of rain and 
 over 80 cm of snow in three days many of us are wondering what s in store for the spring 
 of 1991 the adverse weather could be a blessing in terms of training imagine organizing the base to dredge and 
 shore up the banks of the chilliwack river the only thing standing in the way of this endeavour is a 
 strong lobby the fish factor who feel that salmon and steelhead are more important than people s homes another more 
 reasonable alternative given an intensive course for the public in the art of snow removal and winter driving it certainly 
 was a nightmare to drive outside the base during the famous storm of 1991 the base had as a matter

 62 ottawa area patricias by capt m j parker with a notable exception life for ottawa area patricias in 1990 
 returned to normal after the excitement of the 75th anniversary celebrations the exception being the arrival of four captains something 
 of a youth movement around here from technical staff training in the united kingdom the regiment has sent officers on 
 such training before but this year s draft represented the largest such group and the first concentrated venture into project 
 management the consequence of this is that the infantry is now achieving significantly more influence on the type and nature 
 of weapons and equipment to be fielded in the future and while this is not glamorous employment in the usual 
 sense it is a small but important step forward for both the corps and the regiment thankfully other positive aspects 
 of the regiment s representation here have not changed from the cds through copfd mgen sharpe and cdlo mgen reay 
 to the fifty officers and ncos fulfilling roles such as operations staff officers and career managers the regiment maintains a 
 high profile and dominant presence in the halls of decision much to the chagrin of our fellow regiments arms and 
 corps while mgen reay leaves ndhq in aps 91 to assume new duties as dcomd fmc the regimental presence here 
 will continue with the arrival of lgen foster who will become the assistant deputy minister personnel also in aps 91

 rss and the land engineering and test establishment lete our numbers are widely dispersed 0:dis 0:persed around the national capital 
 region but they continue to come together for the traditional monthly lunch and regimental occasions these events are often the 
 only opportunity for many to keep pace with happenings in the real world of the battalions and the battle school 
 and to reinforce 0:rein 0:force the regimental identity in particular seventy officers ncos and members of the association attended the 
 march 17th dinner at the army officer s mess which included after dinner comments 0:com 0:ments from general de chastelain 
 on august 10th area patricias were accorded yip status at the changing of the guard on parliament hill cour tesy

 another ottawa area patricia tradition that was upheld this year was the remembrance day ceremony 0:cere 0:mony conducted at the 
 regimental memorial at lansdowne park by our association the significance 0:signifi 0:cance of the memorial the uniqueness of the ceremony 
 0:cere 0:mony among military organizations in the region and the true family atmosphere made for a moving experience for the 
 serving and retired patricias and their families as well as for the representatives of the dutch and korean governments in

 63 land forces central area implementation on 15 december 1989 the commander of land forces central area lfca mgen r 
 i stewart issued his implementation plan designed to amalgamate 0:amal 0:gamate the regular force and the militia in ontario into 
 a total force formation the headquarters was to become the first of four new area command headquarters as part of 
 fmc headquarters decentralization of command and operations for the total force concept the commander s plan consisted of four phases 
 with phase one being the amalgamation of the cma and lfca headquarters into a single staff with lcfa assuming command 
 on 01 february 1990 01 april was the date for phase two which was the disbandment of cma and the 
 start of lfca operations to include the incorporation into the area of the five militia districts rss central the ceremonial 
 guard and mtsc meaford the third phase on 01 august was the incorporation of the ssf and cfb petawawa including 
 the rcr battle school into lfca the final phase was the incorporation of cfb toronto and london into lfca on 
 01 october 1990 since flexibility is a key principle of war and reorganization 0:reor 0:ganization timings and plans soon bent 
 for instance the cfoo schedule for 01 april occurred 15 july and phase two occurred 18 august heralded 0:herald 0:ed 
 by the transfer of command parade between mgen stewart and bgen hall these actions in turn forces phase three back 
 to 01 september mgen stewart being a hands on commander sorted out the delays personally setting the plan back on 
 track by mid september thus by the final phase quoting persian gulf sitreps all actions were proceeding according to plan 
 and phase four was completed on 01 october 1990 being the first fully operational new area headquarters it is only 
 fitting that patricias fill many of the key staff positions in this headquarters situated 0:situ 0:ated in the heartland of 
 that other english speaking regiment besides the commander patricias are employed on the gl g 3 and g 5 staffs 
 maj wayne ramsden in g 1 management has under his tutelage three officers capt brian flynn capt pat henneberry and 
 capt rock weigand who together implement the commander s personnel policies throughout the area maj phil tweedie and wo mike 
 snea in g 3 maintain control over operations and taskings in lfca finally in g 5 lcol barry winfield representing 
 the total force concept is once again on full time service as a class b callout to manage regional operations 
 projects the year for the headquarters has been an extremely busy one above and beyond the rigors of the implementation 
 program and the production of a study on the closure of cfb london the commander and his staff have had 
 to deal with normal training requirements such as on guard 90 as well as many new operational taskings civil unrest 
 in oka kahnawake and akewasane proved to be the chief concerns of the headquarters during 0:dur 0:ing the summer also 
 lfca was involved in aiding the province with the haagerstown tire fire as an assistance to civil authorities task these 
 problems 0:prob 0:lems were closely followed by troop and equipment deployments to the gulf for operations friction and scalpel thus 
 as 1990 came to an end lfca hq demonstrated not only that total force is a workable 0:work 0:able concept 
 but that the decentralized command system can work in peace and in preparation for war out of retirement lcol b

 the imminent visit of the career managers 0:man 0:agers thoughts turn to the hopeful posting back out west for those 
 of us who don t make it there will always be our get togethers and the patrician to keep us 
 in touch with events of regimental importance this past year saw a large departure from our ranks and the arrival 
 of just a few new faces while some of us the unfortunate had to stay from the top quebec region 
 patricias still have a strangle hold on the command with lgen foster as commander fmc col almstrom remained as dcos

 patricia presence is maintained by sgt melnechuck at the cfb st jean language school and mcpl marshall at the recruit 
 school regimental activities centered upon our monthly luncheons which gave everyone a chance to exchange rumours and keep abreast of 
 the latest ppcli news the highpoint of the quebec ppcli year has always been the regimental day celebrations 0:celebra 0:tions

 65 canadian forces recruit school cornwallis how time flies when you re having fun it seems like only yesterday i 
 was sitting at my desk working on the article for the regiment s 75th anniversary we the patricias from the 
 canadian forces recruit school cornwallis have had yet another very productive year as a group we feel extremely 0:extreme 0:ly 
 proud to have been a part of a team that has helped train over 3000 recruits for the canadian forces

 we raised the regimental flag to celebrate the founding of the regiment mcpl sandford l e had the honour of 
 raising the flag training support company a vast amount of the patricias that are working in cfrs work with the

 66 the french grey battalion by major grant mcnally greetings from all patricias in the gagetown area our year was 
 marked by a number of activities packed with regimental spirit for although we re thousands of miles from regimental hq 
 there certainly 0:cer 0:tainly is no lack of patricia esprit de corps here the french grey battalion is blessed with 
 an extremely close relationship with its retired members 0:mem 0:bers who comprise the atlantic branch of the ppcli association and 
 it is thanks to their influence 0:influ 0:ence that our regimental spirit is second to none early in the year 
 we were favoured with a visit from the colonel of the regiment bgen rs graham cd ret d on the 
 occasion of his presentation of the hamilton gault trophy to 2 rcr just to prove that he really did prefer 
 gagetown s climate to that of vancouver island he again paid us a visit in august to present the ppcli 
 cap badge to its newest members from the phase iv officers graduation 0:grad 0:uation class knowing that he would not 
 return before the change of appointment parade as part of exercise ric a dam doo the french grey battalion bid 
 bgen graham a most fond farewell and we certainly wish both betty and he the best of health and happiness 
 back in qualicum beach with march and april came two highlights of the year regimental day and kapyong day both 
 activities saw excellent attendance on the part of the atlantic branch of the ppcli association as a matter of fact 
 it was the branch personnel who made kapyong day such a vivid memory and it was hosted by a great 
 korean war vet bob whittaker who at the time was the president of the branch bob was joined by our 
 very own capt bob parent as they gave us an audio visual tour of the battle and its principle characters 
 and you know that with the likes of bob whittaker eugene macbean and andrew oldford we were not lacking colour 
 commentary there is simply no match for having the wisdom and experience of these fine men who were there and 
 served their country and regiment so well on the lighter side just to ensure that the senior nco s don 
 t break the eligibility 0:eligi 0:bility rules for regimental day broom i loo the officers have every intention this year 
 of ensuring that the designated import rule is enforced by declaring the likes of mwo tiny mcnaughton from cornwallis as 
 ineligible for play or perhaps considering the devastating effect on the senior nco s morale we should let him play 
 afterall on a sadder note it was only three months after kapyong day that a magnificent member of the regimental 
 family and president of the atlantic chapter bob whittaker passed away suddenly in july all members of the french grey 
 and the atlantic branch will miss this dear old friend and companion fall in the maratimes saw the annual general 
 meeting of the atlantic branch conducted in aldershot just outside of kentville nova scotia the members did a simply outstanding 
 job of organizing 0:orga 0:nizing and hosting the event which took place over the thanksgiving weekend two members of the 
 french grey battalion maj grant mcnally and capt nick martyn were in attendance as the co of the french grey 
 and secretary treasurer of the branch respectively to witness the spirit and camaraderie of the many members who attended mgen 
 wilson smith ret d and his lovely wife bea were the guests of honour and we hope to see them 
 again soon in the fredericton area for further regimental activities earlier in the summer the french grey bid farewell to 
 two of its most senior members on posting that being the commander ctc bgen mackenzie and maj pete hofman as 
 well as a whole host of others who moved as part of the annual posting plot the last major event 
 of the year although it did in fact slip into the new year was the change of command of the 
 royal canadian school of infantry from maj tom kontra of the rcr to lcol shaun tymchuk on 17 january before 
 was the traditional mess dinner few of us will ever forget having the dinner interrupted for a brief sitrep from 
 the commander ctc bgen baril as he advised us that war had just broke out in the persian gulf also 
 in attendance was the colonel commandant of the infantry corps lgen belzile who shared with us his views on the 
 conflict lcol harry elliott was to assume command here in late july but while on exercise in wainwright he became 
 very seriously ill it was only because of his spirit and fitness that he was able to overcome his life 
 threatening illness and we now understand that he is improving remarkably well we all wish him a complete and speedy 
 recovery as his condition 0:condi 0:tion improves day to day well if it s possible to sum up a year 
 s activities overflowing with spirit and regimental pride that about does it best wishes from the french grey battalion and 
 the atlantic branch vp 
 67 our regimental band by sgt d a collier the ppcli band performs music that links all human beings cultivating 
 an awareness of our country the canadians forces and the ppcli regiment the band s music enhances regimental self identity 
 cohesion and bonds to the past the band communicates to the public through music qualities of the regiment such as 
 pride and professionalism that other media would find difficult to do a mental image is created by the public of 
 regimental qualities when they see and hear a military music performance the ppcli band displays 0:dis 0:plays a finished product 
 of the regiment in a universal 0:uni 0:versal language that can be transported anywhere in the world as general vernon 
 said the band makes the military presence known to the public in a very positive fashion l as members of 
 the ppcli regiment the band welcomes this opportunity to describe events that accentuate general vernon s comment and to provide 
 0:pro 0:vide a few insights into events the band realized that the regiment is not always visible to the public 
 0:pub 0:lic and that it is not the regiment s primary job to be so a primary part of the 
 band s job is visibility the reflected image of the regiment countless times after performances the band has received inquiries 
 from the public about many facets of the armed forces and the regiment these inquiries suggest that the band is 
 successfully communicating 0:communicat 0:ing the qualities of the regiment to the public this reflected image attracts the public and stimulates 
 many people to become members of the canadian forces the association of military bands with the public is not new 
 as far back as the 18th century newspaper 0:newspa 0:per articles in canada account for military bands performing on many 
 occasions for example regimental bands stationed in halifax during the last half of the eighteenth century supplied music for military 
 activities and performed at various civic ceremonies the nova scotia chronicle reported in 1770 that two bands of music travelled 
 to st paul s church for the celebration of the feast of st john the baptist 2 in 1798 the 
 final chorus of the messiah and the coronation anthem by handel were performed at a church service by several gentlemen 
 and the music bands of the regiments who played the organ 3 and after the arrival at halifax in 1794 
 of prince edward augustus later the duke of kent his regimental band performed promenade concerts each saturday morning although scattered 
 bits of information indicate that the french continued to have an active musical life most of what is known of 
 formal music making in quebec after the conquest is from british accounts these generally indicate a heavy reliance on the 
 musicians of military bands one function of the bands was to perform concerts in the open air as described in 
 the accounts of a visitor 0:visi 0:tor in 1785 we went at 7 o clock to the parade a spacious 
 opening made for place d armes here we saw the 53rd regiment and the 65th which are in garrison here 
 the 65th have an elegant band of music the 53rd have one also but not equal to the other ll 
 august in the evening we took a walk upon the ramparts and parade the music of the two bands and 
 the company of so many officers must have a very great inducement for preferring this place to any other l

 68 the ppcli band enhance the presence of the regiment today as military bands have done in the past a 
 partial account of an article published in the roundup 1990 depicts this role played by the ppcli band during armed 
 forces day demonstration of the high standard of professionalism 0:profession 0:alism in all segments of the ppcli regiment occurs once 
 a year on armed forces day the public gains an annual glimpse of the regiment s professional role unfortunately armed 
 forces day falls but once a year often public memories of these special events tend to fade however the public 
 does remember the quality of the regiment s performance through the efforts of their regimental band the ppcli band helps 
 transcend 0:tran 0:scend these qualities of professionalism between armed forces days by presenting public concerts to audiences locally nationally and 
 internationally in a sense the band takes armed forces day with them wherever they go the pride and esprit de 
 corps the very essence of the ppcli lingers on in the minds of participant and spectator alike the band looks 
 forward to continued success in representing 0:repre 0:senting the regiment and canada wherever they perform the spirit of the regiment 
 s accomplishments 0:accomplish 0:ments live on through the touring talents of their own regimental band it was napoleon who said 
 one good music march is worth one hundred cannon most people think that the real function of military bands is 
 to boost morale and camaraderie the band agrees in addition military bands bridge the gap between history and the present 
 through music the ppcli band is no exception they proudly participated in our own 75th anniversary of the regiment the 
 band was reminded as they paraded with the officers 0:offi 0:cers and men of the regiment that our own band 
 was formed in winnipeg in 1919 other main events the band participated in include graduation ceremonies for personnel on military 
 courses and celebrating the arrival of countess mountbatten of burma our colonel ln chief the band played a significant role 
 in the 80th anniversary 0:anniver 0:sary celebration for the king s own and the highlanders with the visit of queen 
 elizabeth june 1990 notably the queen reminded all ranks of the chain of history linking the past with the present 
 s the band participated in commemorative 0:com 0:memorative ceremonies in holland april 1990 and played a major role in november 
 11th remembrance day ceremonies in calgary historically regimental bands play their part in maintaining military traditions by contributing performances 0:per 
 0:formances to the men s mess annual christmas dinner and other esprit de corps caste functions the band has on 
 occasion speculated if this benevolent concept held the same prominence in canadian military history personal research concluded 0:con 0:cluded that 
 many types of military events have historical 0:his 0:torical associations i have identified the following account and quote h p 
 biggar the social tradition brought from the old country called for songs and dance music to enliven feasts fiddles woodwinds 
 and other portable instruments 0:instru 0:ments that were brought by the early settlers played on these occasions the most famous 
 celebrations 0:cel 0:ebrations were sponsored by the order of good cheer ordre dv bon temps champlain established 0:estab 0:lished this 
 social order of chivalry during the winter of 1606 07 to distract the colonists from cold and loneliness in champlain 
 s words it was something 0:some 0:thing that everybody found beneficial to his health and more profitable than all sorts 
 of medicine we might have used this order consisted of a chain which we used to place with certain little 
 ceremonies 0:cere 0:monies about the neck of one of our people commissioning 0:com 0:missioning him for that day to go 
 hunting the next day it was conferred upon another and so on in order 6 lescarbot provides details of the 
 ceremony 0:cere 0:mony at the evening meal for that was our chief banquet at which the ruler of the feast 
 or chief butler having 0:but 0:ler 0:having had everything prepared by the cook marched in napkin on shoulder wand of 
 office in hand and around his neck the collar of the order which was worth more than four crown after 
 him all the members of the order each carrying a dish the same was repeated at dessert though not always 
 with so much pomp and at night before giving thanks to god he handed over to his successor 0:suc 0:cessor 
 in charge the collar of the order with a cup of wine and they drank to each other 7 4

 69 it appears characteristically that some of the regiment s 0:regi 0:ment 0:s celebrations are not all that dissimilar i 
 e the men s christmas dinner the order of good cheer alludes to the participation 0:participa 0:tion of musicians i 
 am sure although it is not mentioned in this account that the musicians valued 0:val 0:ued their feelings of association 
 in this chivalrous role the ppcli band definitely valued their role december 1990 when they performed the second annual christmas 
 concert at the jack singer hall in calgary to a near capacity audience the price for admission gifts presented to 
 the needy children 0:chil 0:dren of calgary the event held an additional bonus people commented to musicians after the concert 
 that they were proud to be associated with the regiment another role the ppcli band performs regularly is reviving memories 
 the band was called upon to perform music that reflected the tragedies and solemnness of wwii during a recent visit 
 to holland the band experienced shadows of memories pass over faces of many wwii veterans on several occasions perhaps they 
 were linking the band with memories of the past their own their regiment their lives one can only guess the 
 band heightened everyone s feelings on this tour music seems to transcend politics and war by its appeal to human 
 emotion through the band s musical performances they successfully reflected the emotion of events whether it was in the past 
 or in the present i have included an article 0:arti 0:cle from the roundup b that describes this particular 0:par 
 0:ticular tour titled a celebration of peace it is an appropriate conclusion in that it exhibits music as a catalyst 
 linking human beings across history time zones and societal borders april 19 1945 yesterday in germany and back today in 
 holland we move into arnhem and it s a mess it fell two days ago after heavy artillery shelling and 
 house to house fighting only buildings left in any fair condition 0:condi 0:tion are on the edge of the city 
 and the civilians are walking around in a daze starving to death one wonders if the price of liberation is 
 worth all this 9 forty five years later the answer to this canadian soldier s diary entry continues to be 
 acknowledged yes it is worth it the sincere dutch appreciation of the liberation of holland is still evident by their 
 genuine special hospitality extended to all canadians today the surviving dutch generation not only continues to cherish this event but 
 strive to enhance their children s comprehension of it through this conscious effort their children better understand what peace freedom 
 and liberation are all about all those participating in the netherlands 45th anniversary liberation commemoration 0:commem 0:oration ceremonies became more 
 cognizant to the cost of that freedom apeldoorn a city that owes its liberation to canadian soldiers april 17 1945

 department of veterans affairs an estimated 0:estimat 0:ed 3 500 war veterans from across canada dutch royalty and 300 000 
 dutch citizens the weather complemented the occasion in this beautiful city setting the stage for one of the most memorable 
 tours in recent band history a sharp contrast to conditions 45 years ago the national commemoration march of liberators proved 
 to be the highlight event for all those involved the parade commander was general g kitching the defence staff member 
 of the ist canadian division in 1945 and h r h princess margriet of holland took the salute holland s 
 minister of national defence and many other dignitaries 0:digni 0:taries also attended the procession wound its ways through apeldoorn during 
 which people invaded the ranks shaking vet s hands and conveying 0:con 0:veying their appreciation people actually crowded the parade 
 to a halt on several occasions the royal apeldoorn tattoo held near the het loo royal palace presented a spectacular 
 event that added to this celebration of peace bands from several countries demonstrated their talent in elaborate 0:elab 0:orate musical 
 displays in this exposition the ppcli band executed an intricate march design while performing music ranging from classical to jazz 
 according to many citizens the ppcli band was decidedly the best of the five participating bands the audience numbering in 
 the thousands applauded the band s performance as if sensing the pride felt by the band in representing canada and

 relaxed in different places such as the country club park plaza hotel park lane club moonlight gardens kit kat club 
 and the canadian club as in the past the restored canadian club again served as a meeting place for canadians 
 the ppcli band took advantage of the opportunity to meet informally with many of the dutch people and canadian veterans 
 it was an education talking with them as they relived their experiences and quizzed us about army life as we 
 know it today time did not exist the last 45 years just slipped away as these soldiers reminisced humour and 
 old girl friends seemed to dominate conversations and surprisingly there was very little reference to the horrors and tragedies we 
 talked to the veteran who met his old girlfriend on this trip for the first time since the war the 
 story made the newspaper no doubt much to his wife s chagrin conversations included my own father s involvement 0:involve 
 0:ment in regimental activities in and around apeldoorn having these particular veterans send my father an invitation to attend the 
 dieppe reunion in 1992 personalized this soldier s tour the ppcli stage band performed for the liberation ball at the

 cemeteries in holland bergen op zoom holten and groesbeek where the dutch meticulously maintain the 7000 plus graves of canadian 
 soldiers the emotional intensity 0:inten 0:sity present at the cemeteries is in itself a tribute to how deeply memories are 
 still alive in canada and the netherlands emotions bear witness to sacrifices 0:sacri 0:fices not forgotten the ceremony at westerbork 
 was heart wrenching during the war 160 000 jewish people were processed and shipped out by rail to be executed 
 the emotion further intensified by the rabbi as he paused in his prayers to fight back tears effects of this 
 pause ran through the assembly like a cold knife we can only image the destitution horror and terror that these 
 dutch jews experienced i could not help thinking why is the band here why were bands present in 1945 one 
 would question a symbol of peace present during a war yet in peace as in war music serves as a 
 catalyst for marking a moment in time during the war military 0:mili 0:tary bands were soldiers set to music route 
 marches church parades concerts victory parades through both defeated and liberated towns and cities any tune or style of music 
 seems to make a time for everyone regardless of who they are music draws people together in a common moment 
 of thought emotion and on this particular tour memories since biblical times military bands have boosted morale and marked events 
 in history events beseech music it seems that they are not significant without it i cannot think of a better 
 way to parade our pride and professionalism in a regiment and country than via a military band

 to 800 regimental family members participated in the 3 day anniversary the countess mountbatten of burma the regiments colonel in 
 chief flew to the city from london england to be with her regiment the last remaining loyal regiment in the 
 commonwealth 
 74 75th anniversary the loyal edmonton regiment 4 ppcli the victoria day long weekend may 18 21 1990 was the 
 focal point of the 75th anniversary celebrations 0:cele 0:brations of the loyal edmonton regiment 4 pcli this was the culmination 
 of several years planning and preparation involving many of the regiment s senior members as well as personnel in the 
 ppcli regimental headquarters and battle school approximately three years earlier our commanding officer lcol david nielsen initiated the planning of 
 our 75th anniversary as well as confirming our participation in the ppcli 75th anniversary celbrations taking place throughout 1989 since 
 our location in edmonton would provide us the opportunity to represent the ppcli in this city it was decided that 
 we would combine with the ppcli battle school and exercise the freedom of the city on june 10 1989 this 
 worked well for the battle school and ourselves and because of our relatively smaller numbers allowed us to field a 
 reasonabley large parade to represent the ppcli on this occaision it also gave the new co lcol glenn jones the 
 opportunity to cemebnt an laready good relationship with the battle school thus ensuring success for future combined activities 0:activi 0:ties 
 the loyal edmonton regiment was originally formed as the 49th battalion canadian expeditionary force on january 4th 1915 by lieutenant 
 colonel later major general w a billy griesbach as january in edmonton does not lend itself well to outdoor parades 
 and other activities the victoria day long weekend was chosen 0:cho 0:sen as an appropriate time to center all our 
 celebrations 0:cele 0:brations around detailed planning began in the fall of 1989 and we quickly realized the magnitude of the 
 project we had undertaken although small in number the battalion headquarters soon had enlisted the aid of most of the 
 senior officers and nco s in the unit to assist us in this task we also enlisted the aid of 
 the battle school and asked that they provide a 50 man guard for the parade this was phase ii of 
 our combined operation 0:opera 0:tion of a year earlier as may drew near we finalized 0:final 0:ized details with the 
 battle school and began parade rehearsals which included a weekend on the parade square in wainwright one problem not yet 
 resolved was the ppcli regimental band which was touring europe and was expected back in time for our celebrations they 
 almost didn t make it but eventually arrived only a few hours before the parade very tired from their hurried 
 journey back to canada with their instruments but without their scarlets the colonel in chief the countess mountbatten of burma 
 had arrived in edmonton earlier in the week and was the guest of honour at the sir winston churchhill society 
 dinner on thursday evening may 17th our honourary lieutenant colonel bob chapman and the lcol jones welcomed 0:wel 0:comed lady 
 patricia on friday morning may 18th and we now assumed responsibility for her wellbeing 0:well 0:being until her departure monday

 lady patricia was the guest of honour friday night was the officers dining ln at the mayfair golf and country 
 club with the lieutenant governor helen hunley in attendance saturday morning was the final parade dress rehearsal at griesbach then 
 we attended a welcome home reception hosted by the city of edmonton at the convention center during this time lady 
 patricia flew to wainwright to visit the second battalion in the field saturday night the all ranks balls was held 
 at the convention center during this event lady patricia graciously spoke with two of our originals dave barbour age 94 
 now deceased and dave petrie age 97 we were also very pleased to have with us colonel big jim stone 
 well known to many patricias and mgen g g brown and mrs brown sunday morning we were up bright and 
 early although a little bleary eyed for the church parade at all saints anglican cathedral from there we formed up 
 the guards and bands and marched to the citadel theatre where acting mayor bruce campbell welcomed the regiment at this 
 point the co presented the city of edmonton police pipe band replicas of the original 49th battalion pipe band cap 
 badge to commemorate 0:commemo 0:rate our affiliation back to our founding upon her arrival lady patricia received the regimental salute 
 and then inspected the parade the old guard approximately 200 strong and the cadet guard then fell in and we 
 marched to the cenotaph where wreaths were layed in honour of our fallen comrades from the cenotaph we then marched 
 several blocks through downtown edmonton exercising the freedom of the city granted to us on june sth 1965 after the 
 parade everyone journeyed out to camp harris the unit s prperty on the western outskirts of the city for the 
 annual association picnic unfortunately the mosquitos were in fine form byt the lovely weather and country setting more than made 
 up for it sunday morning hon lcol chapman and lcol jones bade farewell to lady patricia she had been a 
 most gracious and charming honoured guest who was genuinely interested in her fourth battalion it was truly an honour and 
 a pleasure to have her in attendance our celebrations were now coming to a close and culminated with a brunch 
 at the convention center where many weary participants bade their farewells all in all a very active and full weekend 
 these celebrations must be considered a great success the cooperation and support received from all members of the ppcli family 
 greatly assisted us and further proved the value of our affiliation sincere thanks are offered to the colonel of the 
 regiment bgen graham and mrs graham as well as the regimental major michael goodspeed and the regimental adjutant capt rudy 
 raidt special thanks to the battle school particularly lcol hap stutt and all his officers and men who participated on 
 our parade the regimental band combined with our own unit band did an outstanding job as usual we in the 
 loyal edmonton regiment look forward to any and all future activities of this kind it was a very large job 
 but well worth the effort 
 76 the royal green jackets happily 1990 has been a busy and productive year for the regiment which includes our 
 three regular and two territorial battalions our training depot at winchester is of course shared with the light infantry with 
 whom together we form the light division the depot is the home of the two regiments so as you can 
 imagine the activity between outposts are numerous and no month could possible be considered dull training recruits is still the 
 depot s bread and butter with added problems of the vagaries of the new management strategy this new system is 
 a move towards greater financial efficiency and accountability whilst it has drawbacks such as the re naming of company commanders 
 to cost centre managers it has focused everyone s minds much more on the business aspects of soldiering furthermore we 
 have moved to a system of monthly recruit intakes which adds a certain amount of pressure to the administrative staff 
 but should result in a more regular draft of recruits to each battalion all these changes take time to implement 
 but we are confident 0:confi 0:dent that with hard work and a degree of light division cuffmanship the results will 
 be good the ist battalion still at osnabruck became heavily 0:heav 0:ily involved early in the year with project star 
 a baor reservist exercise which stretched manning and humour to the limits february heralded the start of the annual brigade 
 and divisional cpxs which were more constrained than ever by environmental 0:environ 0:mental issues a thread that has woven itself 
 more forthrightly into all our training in recent months and looking to get even more restrictive the all arms battlegroup 
 training progressed well at soltau in preparation for canada the majority of the battalion flew to canada towards the end 
 of july to start exercise medicine man 4 at suffield letter a company returned from leave as we departed to 
 deploy to suffield at the end of august with 4 rtr bg for 1 rgj bg special to arm training 
 kept us all busy during the early phases of the exercises the exercise lasted about a fortnight and was accompanied 
 throughout by first class weather towards the end of the exercise the battle group undertook some fast moving and demanding 
 exercises 0:exer 0:cises mechanical reliability permitting we handed over all the vehicles to 4 rtr bg with a company and 
 took about five days leave in canada the officers mess moved to calgary and spent a very pleasant evening with 
 1 ppcli this event was enjoyed by all and was set up by a number of past and present exchange 
 officers as well as both commanding officers shortly after reassembling the majority of the battalion in osnabruck a flurry of 
 signals heralded events which have affected the entire battalion a force of letter b company and support company was warned 
 off to deploy with the queen s dragoon guards to saudi arabia with the americans as events unfolded 7 armd 
 bde was sent and within hours 1 rgj were asked for instructors reinforcements and equipment to bring 7 armd bde 
 up to wartime establishment currently some 66 members of the battalion are serving on op granby the battalion spent some 
 three to four weeks helping 7 armd bde with refresher training on nbc first aid fitness and live firing as 
 well as assistance with painting a large proportion of the brigade s 1500 vehicles 
 77 as this is being written commitments include a reinforced company at emden docks guarding elements 0:ele 0:ments of 4 
 armd bde as their vehicles and supplies 0:sup 0:plies embark for the gulf while the second battalion has had another 
 varied and challenging 12 months the main highpoint of the year has been participation in exercise pond jump west in 
 wainwright canada in july august 1990 the first 3 months of the year were devoted to a series of internal 
 cadres which included one for junior ncos to build on skills learnt on the section commanders battle course throughout the 
 period 0:peri 0:od they were on call and at reduced notice to move to meet a variety of contingecy plans 
 in mainland britain but not all was hard work 80 members of the battalion took part in centrally organized week 
 long skiing trips to either italy or france this increased skiing expertise proved fortuitous as despite the distance from dover 
 we had to despatch 2 companies to scotland to help run the army ski championships during the period though may 
 and june were therefore essentially devoted to training the ceremonies on 23 may to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 
 defence of calais in 1940 by battalions of the king s royal rifle corps the rifle brigade and queen s 
 victoria rifles former regiments of the royal green jackets the day s events included a service 0:ser 0:vice and march 
 past by the veterans and representatives 0:represen 0:tatives from all 5 battalions at the green jacket memorial a reception by 
 the mayor of calais a band and bugle display and a cocktail party on board the sir belvedere it was 
 a most successful 0:success 0:ful and moving day in early july the battalion reinforced by amongst others 76 field battery 
 royal artillery and a composite 0:com 0:posite troop from 53 squadron royal engineers air trooped to canada for exercise pond 
 jump west in this each company completed a series of packages lasting from 5 7 days section and platoon 0:pla 
 0:toon level dry and live firing exercises a battalion headquarters organized level dry and live firing exercise which in a 
 deliberate company live firing attack adventure training in the rocky mountains and a brief period of leave in edmonton the 
 culmination 0:cul 0:mination of the 5 weeks in canada was a 72 hour battalion exercise in which fieldcraft battle procedure 
 0:proce 0:dure navigation and watermanship skills were tested 0:test 0:ed thoroughly in all expectations of the value of the exercise 
 were met in full wainwright is an excellent training area the rockies are spectacular and the adventure training facilities first 
 class and the citizens of edmonton hospitable to a fault colonel anthony palmer handed over command to colonel nick cottam 
 on 17 september coincidentally on colonel anthony s last full day a rededication service was held at the memorial in 
 dover to the fallen of the ist 60th rifles during the indian campaign of 1856 9 at which field marshal 
 bramall took the salute the service was followed by a sounding of retreat accompanied with a spectacular 0:spec 0:tacular fireworks 
 display on dover seafront the forging of our links with 2 gr during the campaign were very much in mind 
 and it was a fitting way to mark 2 rgj s departure from dover early in the new year at 
 the time of writing the battalion is fully engaged in training for northern ireland in 91 and look forward 0:for 
 0:ward to the tour in the province as just another challenge for the past year the 3rd battalion has continued 
 its tour as the last resident battalion in gibraltar they have been kept surprisingly busy on what many believe to 
 be a sunshine posting training facilities on the rock are limited so the rifle companies and i company have taken 
 part in two periods of overseas training during the year these exercises where each company went away in turn proved 
 to be both popular and rewarding the first a month in england last summer gave us a chance to revise 
 skills at platoon level and take our annual mandatory tests the second a two week exercise in portugal in the 
 spring gave us a marvellous opportunity to carry out rather more advanced training in a counter revolutionary setting in a 
 remote and underused training area this was in complete contrast to gibraltar where our main duties are either ceremonial or 
 security tasks to this end we have provided the guard for the six monthly ceremony of the keys a tableau 
 of the traditional ritual of locking the fortress at last light and posting an outpost platoon as sentries outside the 
 city walls the largest ceremonial event of the year has been the queen s birthday parade in june three guards 
 commanded by the commanding officer had to go through the full spectrum of drill movements 0:move 0:ments including a double 
 past the spectators were kind in their praise although after the amount of practices held they would have hardly dared 
 say anything else 
 78 after the ira attack in gibraltar in 1988 the idea of living away from the terrorist threat has been 
 dispelled 0:dis 0:pelled there is a regular requirement to mount security operations in support of the small local police force 
 and we maintain a constant standby company we have to work closely with both the royal navy and the air 
 force and have become far more purple than this time last year among the most notable events outside our normal 
 routine have been two battlefield tours of the peninsula war in november we retraced the steps of sir john moore 
 s retreat to corunna after visiting the 1812 battlefield at salamanca which is still very well preserved this was followed 
 in may by a trip to the fortress towns of badjos and ciudad rodrigo and a number of the portuguese 
 battles including bussaco both trips were fascinating and brought to life the traditions established for us by our forbears aside 
 from the major events we continue to enjoy life on the mediterranean the advantages of gibraltar are numerous trips into 
 souther spain the algarve morocco adventure training including climbing caving and water sports all outweigh what for some may seem 
 a claustrophobic and restrictive environment lt col peter browne has now handed over to lt col jamie balfour as commanding 
 officer and has moved with our best wishes into civilian life the 4th and sth volunteer battalions continue to thrive 
 following successful annual camps a shared skill at arms meeting and testing exercises recruiting figures are encouraging for both officers 
 and rifleman of both sexes it can be said with confidence that the presence of the regiment in the city 
 of london and the two counties of oxfordshire and buckinghamshire is well known and hopefully will continue to be felt 
 1991 has now poked its head around the battlements 0:battle 0:ments and in the light of current affairs throughout the 
 world many developments are looming we all face options for change and the immediate crisis in the gulf with varying 
 degrees of misgiving our one firm conviction however is that those green jackets some seventy who face the challenges and 
 dangers of confrontation in the middle east will acquit themselves as true riflemen just as they always have in the 
 past today thursday 17 january 1991 as this newsletter goes to print war in the gulf has just been declared 
 there is no doubt that in terms not just of argument but of human values those who have come best 
 out of the drama of the past few months have been those who have displayed calm resolution and thank heavens 
 there have been a great many of them from our leaders to those men and women in the front line 
 who say we don t want war but this is what we have trained to do and we must now 
 get on with it the fact that so many people have been able to show this kind of quiet realism 
 and a determination 0:determina 0:tion whatever the horrors may be store to do what they see to be the right 
 thing has been profoundly inspiring and now as the day of reckoning at last arrives it is the recollection of 
 that courageous dedication which we must bear in mind whatever the outcome 
 79 the royal australian regiment 1990 1990 saw the relocation of the regimental headquarters the royal australian regiment from the 
 national capital canberra to the infantry centre in singleton new south wales as part of army s plan to have 
 heads of corps with their respective training establishments in addition to being the commandant of the infantry centre colonel peter 
 cosgrove am mc has assumed the added responsibility of being the regimental colonel the royal australian regiment and head of 
 the royal australian infantry corps no sooner had the battalion returned from leave when bouganville flared up and operation defence 
 got into full swing b company were earmarked as a reserve force and others were actually detached to 2 4 
 rar to help raise their overall strength though not deployed the whole activity once again proved that regardless of who 
 is on line as members of the operational deployment force odf we must all be ready to move at short 
 notice with events in australia s area of interest training in 1990 was focused on the section commanders and wherever 
 possible in close country the first major activity was the individual and section 0:sec 0:tion training conducted at koombaloomba training 
 was left entirely in the hands of the section commanders who responded to the challenge 0:chal 0:lenge the training phase 
 culminated in a test of individual and section skills run at various stands from koombaloomba to cowley beach the exercise 
 0:exer 0:cise will perhaps be best remembered for b company s submerged rifle which took quite some finding the various 
 shortcuts taken off the escarpment and for the battalion 2ic who when contemplated doing the route march and asking about 
 the conditions was told there was a wonderful 0:wonder 0:ful breeze channelled by the roads coral day was another spectacular 
 ceremonial event the sky was black with blackhawks as the battalion flew onto parade in a symbolic representation 0:represen 0:tation 
 of the fly into fspb coral in 1968 the parade was followed by an open day which was even more 
 successful than last year s it was so good in fact that the commanding officer was nominated as the barnham 
 and bailey of the brigade open day conducted in october the battalion returned to the jungle in july for a 
 platoon competition pitched at testing the platoons in offensive low level operations in close country the operations officer had searched 
 all of north queensland for the right piece of terrain to run the exercise he finally settled on bluewater now 
 well known in the battalion for its beautiful vistas gentle rolling hills and clear rainforest at least that s how 
 it was in bhq s area the battalion deployed straight from bluewater to high range for the annual live firing 
 exercise and from there straight back to paluma for the annual field exercise there were many highlights 0:high 0:lights the 
 battalion honed its close country fighting 0:fight 0:ing skills and passed the odf test with flying colours the exercise will 
 be remembered for d company s epic trek along the bambaroo track amongst other places which is now famous as 
 the 1990 d tour it will also be remembered for the vegetation being so thick that it tore the shirts 
 from the backs of snipers following a contact that s their story anyway 
 80 services protected evacuation was the theme of exercise swift eagle 90 this is a new area of training for 
 the brigade as a whole the battalion worked very well to achieve good results on the exercise its first big 
 test on the on line battalion we had a particularly busy two weeks after the september break not only were 
 we rehearsing madly for the trooping of the colours parade to celebrate the battalion s 45th birthday but we also 
 took on the lion s share of work for the brigade open day both activities were outstanding successes 0:suc 0:cesses 
 the courses period in october and november were busy for everyone over 400 members of the battalion gained specialist or 
 promotion qualifications 0:qualifica 0:tions while the remainder pitched in with duties and the odd adventure training activity the year was 
 full of other highlights most noteworthy 0:note 0:worthy were the victories of the rugby and australian rules teams in their 
 respective competitions 0:competi 0:tions on the military side the success of the duke of gloucester cup team lead by cpl 
 marsh was an outstanding achievement the team reversed last year s results to finish first overall and second in the 
 mcdonald cup competition for night operations overall the year has been a very busy but rewarding 0:reward 0:ing one the 
 battalion continues to display the same military and sporting skills which have been the hallmarks of 1 rar in the 
 past 2 4 rar the battalion began the year as the priority battalion of the operational deployment force odf the 
 training theme for 1990 was back to jungle during february and march individual skills training concurred culminating in the inter 
 section military skills competition reconnaissance platoon provided 0:pro 0:vided the winning section during april and may platoon and company level 
 training was conducted air mobile procedures with the blackhawk helicopter were rehearsed search and destroy operations in a jungle environment 
 0:environ 0:ment were rehearsed a battalion exercise was held during july this exercise involved company live firing practices and deployment

 social activities highlights of this week were a dusk ceremonial parade with fireworks and the battalion all ranks ball during 
 late august the battalion participated in the brigade exercise action included an amphibious landing search and destroy in a jungle 
 area of operation and a brigade live fire attack battalion headquarters deployed to kota bharu malaysia in october to participate

 for a three month term as the duty company at airbase butterworth 3rar the third battalion s activities for 1990 
 began with the various companies being independently deployed throughout eastern australia and overseas 0:over 0:seas to malaysia and hong kong 
 their focus was on hard infantry training and parachute operations the culmination of the year s training came in october 
 with the battalion parachute assault into the brigade exercise predators advance 1990 there the parachute battalion group convincingly demonstrated its 
 strategic capability to the australian defence force by seizing a crucial bridgehead which allowed for the first brigade armoured mechanized 
 breakout the year also saw the 75th anniversary of the anzac landing in gallipoli and the battalion was well represented 
 at a number of ceremonial activities 0:activi 0:ties amongst 3 rar s 1991 ceremonial activities will be the commemoration of 
 the 40th anniversary of the battle of kapyong on the 24th of april at this time we will be reminded 
 of our military heritage 0:her 0:itage particularly our strong associations with our sister battalion the 2nd ppcli and with the 
 other battalions of ppcli for the coming year the commanding officer officers and soldiers of the third battalion old faithful

 in barracks 
 81 in june the battalion took part in exercise predator s 0:preda 0:tor 0:s crawl which was a brigade cpx 
 predator s crawl proved to be a good lead up the exercise predator s advance which was the battalion s 
 major deployment for the year the duke of gloucester cup was foremost in everyone s mind throughout july and the 
 battalion team finished 6th the fact that all the teams were within a few points of each other is a 
 credit to how hard the competition was fought by all the battalions delta company returned from malaysia after three months 
 solid training and with hardly any time to settle back into the mechanized routine deployed with the rest of the 
 battalion on exercise quintas roar after a short three week break the battalion deployed to puckapunyal again to take part 
 in exercise predator s advance 90 this was the battalion s largest deployment since kangaroo 0:kanga 0:roo 89 and the 
 biggest exercise the brigade had seen for some time predator s advance 90 provided another opportunity for 5 7 rar 
 mech to demonstrate the mechanized infantry capability which it did competently and professionally predator s advance 90 marked the end 
 of the training year for 1990 and except for several courses that the unit was involved in the battalion prepared 
 for christmas break the end of 1990 also saw the co lcol r j margetts leave the battalion for a

 the unit s participation in exercise kangaroo 89 however the battalion was tasked with providing the australian army project team 
 papua new guinea to train 300 recruits for the papua new guinea defence force the team deployed to png in 
 july and returned to australia on 23 dec 90 having successfully completed their mission throughout the year the unit training
