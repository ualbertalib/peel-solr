 the kiondike by frank walker people from all parts of the globe assembled in edmonton in 1898 for the purpose
 of going to the klondike by the overland trail or by what was known as the back door route this
 was down the athabasca and mackenzie rivers over the porcupine pass on to the yukon river and then up to
 dawson city and the klondike edmonton at that time was the end of steel ing of these cayuses and the
 arrangements by other parties was a constant source of excitement and amusement to the people in and around edmonton at
 that time i am going only to deal with that part of the trip with which i am quite familiar
 as being one of the parties that went overland during that rush several of the parties left early in january
 by way of st albert paddle river across the athabasca river near old fort assiniboine then over the swan hills
 to lesser slave lake and from there to peace river crossing each nationality fondly imagined that they were the only
 ones that knew how for this purpose a good lot of material was assembled at edmonton for the trip cayuses
 were purchased in southern alberta and boats and other material were brought from eastern canada and the united states the

 was largely through the unknown wilderness of northern alberta and british columbia into the yukon although only about 1200 miles
 this trip took the party a year and three months to complete to travel and had rigged up several most
 ingenious devices for reaching the klondike in the shortest possible time an englishman had brought his baled hay from england
 with him not knowing there was more hay here and cheaper our american cousins to the south who claim to
 be wise in all things had brought a boiler and machinery and rigged up an engine and train of cars
 intending to steam to the klondike with a steam sleigh those who were here at that time will never forget
 the eventful day when the start was supposed to be made with famous steam sleigh the conductor in charge of
 the party shouted all aboard everybody climbed on the whistle blew toot toot and everybody waited there was a burr
 of machinery and the engine gave a little start forward and history records that this famous outfit actually moved 18
 inches in the direction of the klondike a consultation was held among the rank and file as well as the
 chiefs in charge mr walker was a pioneer of fort saskatchewan and represented tile victoria constituency in alberta s first
 legislature in 1905 his recollections are preserved in the historical society of alberta files maintained by the legislative library edmonton
 of the party and they decided that they us up for a week carscadden acted as had better adopt some
 other method doctor and succeeded so well that at the kenny mcleod i believe bought the en end of that
 time when we were overgine and other machinery but what taken by a dr nichols from ohio he became of
 the cars i do not know examined our patient and commended next we come to our canadians a carscadden on
 the excellent care he had party fresh from hamilton had what was taken of him he said that we might
 known as a combined boat and sleigh proceed on our way provided we kept very ingenious this contrivance was him
 comfortable and warm we rigged arranged so that all the goods were piled up a special sleigh and hitched to
 it one inside a horse was hitched to it and of our oldest and quietest horses in the jogged along
 over the frozen snow and morning we would lift cinnamon bed ice the advantage was supposed to and all into
 the sleigh full length and be that when it came to a river all they start on our journey he
 recovered so had to do was to turn it over and they rapidly that by the time we reached had
 a boat to float across when they peace river he was able to ride horsegot on the other side they
 would turn back throughout this part of the trip it back and behold they had a sleigh we came across
 many very interesting the smart canadians overlooked the fact outfits and events by the time we reachthat when the snow
 and ice were on the ed the athabasca several of the parties ground the rivers were also frozen then who
 had gone ahead of us had become there was the man who had a big barrel very much disgusted with
 the route and filled with pork and beans and other stated so in no uncertain terms upon stuff and a
 pair of shafts hitched to blazed trees some excellent poetry was this he was going to roll his grub to
 the also composed and written there apro klondike pos of the route i now regret that i did the party
 that i was connected with not copy some of it as it would be at consisted of six men five
 of whom were this date very interesting i remember westerners and claimed some knowledge one of these outfits was composed
 of of travelling we had hit upon the old what was known as the big four they method of travelling
 with ccxyuses and were engineers and conductors from the indian jumpers believing from past ex big four railway in the
 u s a they perience that they were the most service were very humorous fellows and always able in travelling
 in the winter especial signed themselves the big four after ly over certain trails these jumpers writing some interesting stuff
 upon trees the runners of which we made out of one of the most heartbreaking hills birch were indeed very
 serviceable one which tried all the skill and ingenuity cayuse was hitched to each jumper and even of the old
 timers who were on the a horse s load would be about 800 trail was at the crossing of the
 north pounds we had 35 horses among the side of the athabasca river near old six and one mule the
 reason i men fort assiniboine the hill is a very long tion the mule is because it was supposed one
 and a great deal of the difficulty to be about 35 years old and was owned was experienced by the
 tenderfeet in by the late donald ross of edmonton handling the horses up this grade the who gave her the
 name of sophia and hillside was littered with broken boxes sophia was just as tough as any other smashed sleighs
 and harness and pracmule i intend to tell you a little later tically every tree on the lower side of
 about one of sophia s exploits the grade was blazed and the owners our party was composed of johnston of
 the outfits gave vent to their feelings carscadden of fort saskatchewan tho in epitaphs upon the trees at the very
 mas cinnamon of agricola j h reid top of the hill on a rotten tree had been and albert walker
 of lamont and wil nailed a piece of board with a hand liczm hepburn for some years a resident pointing
 in each direction the one in of saskatoon and myself we left ed the direction of the klondike had written
 monton on the 8 th of march 1898 in underneath to dawson city 2433 2 tending to make fort st
 john before the miles and underneath the other hand ice got bad in the peace river unfor said to home
 sweet home our party tunately cinnamon was stricken with of course stood and laughed when they pneumonia at paddle river
 which held read this and said this is about right the journey from athabasca to the at grouard we found
 a great gather swan hills was practically uneventful ing of klondikers who were rigging up but at the swan hills
 became simply their outfits for the short journey of awful even the party that i was con eighty miles to
 peace river crossing as nected with who as i have stated be there was a good road from grouard over
 fore were accustomed to travelling in there this part of the journey passed the western country were simply ap quickly
 until going down the big hill palled at the hills that they had to go at peace river crossing quite
 a little up and down i never could understand incident i remember happened to mywhy the man who chose this
 route self at this point i was attempting to should ever pick such a terrible one guide one of our
 horses down the hill however we got over it in time and des and we gathered too much speed with
 cended from the hills to lesser slave the result that while my comrades were lake passing the stuart party of
 hamil yelling to me hold him i found that ton i remember mr stuart quite well he was travelling too
 fast altogether for he was at that time mayor of hamilton comfort but like the fellow who had hold a
 splendid fine looking specimen of a of the bear i could not let go for fear man he died i
 believe in the porcu of getting run over until i pitched headpine country before reaching the klon long into the
 snow at the side of the road dike and the horse left the trail and dashed passing along the south
 shore of into the bush a little further down the lesser slave lake we commenced to boys ragged me about
 that for several find dead horses in abundance the ma days afterwards jority of course dying for the lack of
 we made a short stay at peace river feed and at one place in particular we where we found that
 several of the klonfound several horses dead tied to trees dikers had become disgusted with the by their halters i
 am afraid it would not have been well for the owners of one of the many parties which left edmonton
 them if they had shown up about that in the spring of 1898 is shown preparing for time as all
 our boys were great lovers of hud s b y store business horses in outfitting the parties trip by horsepower
 and were rapidly horses just as we got to chimrose building boats preparing to go down the prairie i will
 now tell you a little mci peace and mackenzie we still continued dent that happened to sophia the mule our
 trip up the river but by the time we we just got to the top of a very steep reached
 dunvegan we were compelled to hill coming up from a creek when get off as the ice was becoming very
 sophia s hind legs gave out and she rotten we were very much disappointed started down the hill backwards not
 in not being able to reach fort st john like an ordinary animal would do by with our sleighs the
 week s delay rolling but end over end like a cart caused by cinnamon s sickness was all wheel there
 was an old rotten tree that was necessary to shorten our route about half way down lying horizontally and caused
 us later over a month s very about four or five feet off the ground hard work by pack trail
 on the north kept up by old rotten branches this tree side of the river we stayed at dun was
 fifteen inches in diameter and vegan about two weeks and left some sophia went through it like a knife and
 of our outfit there such as flour which disappeared down among the trees about we found we had too much
 of to be able 150 feet below we hastily unpacked two to pack with 35 horses at dunvegan we of
 the animals and went down to bring were treated remarkably well by the up sophia s load of flour and
 beans and priest in charge of the mission there and riding saddle which was on top when albert tait who
 was hudson s bay we got down there we found sophia manager at that lime albert tait was right side
 up but wedged in between the father of klondike clonie tait two fairly good sized trees the pack the lightweight
 champion of canada saddle was smashed to pieces but the leaving dunvegan we started up the food was first class
 not even a tear in long hill on the overland trail with pack it we had to cut down a
 tree to get horses and when we got to the top and sophia out and then pull off her load
 looked back it was a wonderful sight she then shook herself got up and to behold it reminded one of
 reading of walked to the top of the hill apparently the retreat from moscow horses pack all right but she
 died about two weeks later she had been hurt internally saddles flour pork and beans were scattered all over the
 hillside our horses from chimrose prairie we started on were not accustomed to pack saddles our trip through the mountains
 by way and on the long uphill climb which was of half river and what is now known as terrible
 even for experienced pack laurier pass to fort graham nothing of horses our horses laid down rolled an exciting nature
 occurred on this porbroke their cinch straps and did every lion of the journey but the fishing was thing possible
 to get our boxes off we excellent the best we had ever seenkept the main bunch moving until we and
 the pasturage was good until we got got to the top this was only the com over the divide we
 reached fort gramencement of our troubles as after we ham about the second of july and there got back in
 the swampy district approx for the first time heard of the war beimately about thirty miles from the river tween
 the united states and spain billy as the frost came out of the ground the fox was in charge of
 the fort graham muskegs became soft the creeks were he was an excellent fellow and did in flood and we
 had a hundred and one everything possible for the klondikers difficulties all with green horses from this point carscadden turned
 back however we reached fort st john home having had enough of the trip the at last and there we
 had the pleasure rest of us proceeded on a few days later of meeting for the first time our old
 going by the east side of the finlay friend peter gunn who was chief factor crossing the left fork about
 four miles of fort st john he was of wonderful from its junction on the way we caught assistance to
 us we can never forget up with a party from colorado who his kindness during our short stay there were
 camped beside a huge copper a few days later we moved up to chim ledge about fifty miles above fort
 rose prairie about twelve or fourteen graham the trail passed right over this miles above fort st john where the
 they remarked that if it was near transfeed was most excellent and here we portation it would be immensely valucamped
 for ten days in order to rest our able after crossing the left fork we camped on the middle fork
 of the finlay lost a horse every day when about forty for a week or ten days for the feed
 was miles from francis lake we decided that excellent and then started up the middle we had better camp and
 leave two of fork crossing the divide on to the black the boys in charge shahaun and reid river which
 is a tributary of the liard elected to stay with the grub and what here we had our first serious
 trouble horses were left cinnamon and i took owing to the advance party which was three of the best and
 with light loads the police i believe letting fires get pushed on to francis lake to build a away on
 them which not only destroyed cabin for the winter as we were conthe timber but burned the moss anc vinced
 by this time that we were too made it very bad for our horses feet we late to make dawson
 city before the had the feet of several horses burned ice formed we had to swim the river in the
 hot ashes during this trip with our horses building a raft to float our supplies over arriving at the end
 down the liard we came to what of francis lake we struck the first snowwas known as sylvester s outpost
 this fall that night when we woke up in was a fur trading place established the morning we found ten
 inches of soft back in the 1870 s by sylvester and snow which made travelling very hard about eighty miles
 east of his original and miserable however we journeyed post at sylvester s landing on dease up the west side
 of the lake and came to river from there to sylvester s landing where about eighteen or twenty klonwas an
 old pack trail which was in very dikers were housed for the winter at a good condition we made excellent
 time point where the finlayson river flows on it passing the south end of deadwood into francis lake lake and
 walker creek which runs into the lake at the south end this creek had within a few days we were
 combeen the cause of a great deal of excite pelled to kill our three horses because ment and considerable gold
 had been the poor things had nothing to eat we taken from it in the 1870 s at sylvester s
 joined the klondikers there and for a few landing hepburn and albert walker days had some excellent fishing on the
 decided to go out to the coast by arm of the lake where the upper francis way of glenora and
 cinnamon reid flows into the lower we quickly conand myself continued our journey alone structed a cabin and prepared for
 the we were joined at this point by a winter and then waited until the ice man from missouri named
 shahaun was firm enough to go back for our cornagain bringing our number to four to rades we started down
 about the end relieve our horses we bought a boat and of november with about five days grub floated our
 supplies down the river to some of which we were compelled to liard post at the junction of the dease
 borrow from the other parties whose and liard rivers and drove our horses own supply was none too plentiful overland
 from liard post we continued when we got to the francis river we our journey up the liard on the
 east side found that the warm water of the lake and up the francis river to francis lake had prevented
 the river from freezing on this leg of the journey our real over there was not even shore ice we
 troubles commenced tried to make a road through the bush but after spending a good day and a half moody
 the officer in charge of the at this laborious work we were com police detachment who were supposed pelled to
 return we took up our abode to be the pathfinders had a faculty of in the cabin again and through
 the genquarrelling with practically every guide erosity of our new made friends were that he had and they left him
 very able to subsist until we made a second shortly after their employ moody not and successful attempt a few
 days before knowing very much about travel himself christmas on this trip we had as cornhugged the river bank pretty
 close with panion r c macdonald who was later the result that we were taken down into superintendent of dominion
 telegraphs windfalls and muskeg of the worst kind at edmonton on arriving again at the as this was in the
 end of september and francis river we still found it open but early in october there was practically this time
 determined that we must get no feed in that country and our horses through so we plunged along through died
 rapidly in fact for a while we the deep snow on the bank and after very hard work for nearly
 two days we sight and for that night and the next came out on the river where the ice was
 day we fared remarkably well on plenty firm we took off our snow shoes and of moose meat from here
 there was a were like a bunch of children running well beaten track down the river to the along on
 the ice our joy was short lived liard post so the next day we had no however we had only
 gone a couple of difficulty in getting through to our cache miles until we came to where the ice when
 we arrived there we found a had formed early in the fall and the note had been left by our
 comrades reid snow was very deep which necessitated and shahaun that they were ten miles our putting on our snow
 shoes again further down the river wintering in a travelling down a very short way we cabin the first thing
 we seized on at found that under the snow and on top our cache was a plug of smoking tobacco
 of the ice was a great deal of water each which did taste good after so many and anybody who
 has snow shoed weeks without it we had tried smoking knows what that means in a short dis tea coffee
 and bark but they were poor tance the snow shoes became so heavy substitutes the next day after joining that
 travelling was practically impos reid and shahaun after a happy reunion sible so we turned up the bank to camp
 we settled down for a couple of weeks in the bush i remember quite well at before taking the return
 journey tobogthis time that arriving at the edge of gans were not a success in drawing the timber weary and
 discouraged i heavy loads so we cut them down and turned about and remarked to macdon made sleighs out of
 them and then ald who was following me this is started relaying our outfit back early in hell to which
 he made answer no january when we got to the indian this is christmas day i then and there camp
 our meat supply was getting low took a vow over our frugal meal that as we were unsuccessful in shooting
 any evening of beans and bannock that we tried to make a deal with the indians never again would i
 spend a christmas for moose meat but those worthies had away from home or an opportunity of heard of the
 high prices in the klondike having a good square meal and asked 1 00 per pound not having for several
 days after that the tray any money we were up against it elling was terribly heavy and being on less
 than half rations we were very but a happy incident happened at this anxious when an indian camp hove into
 time for us 0 this party left edmonton in the same month as walker but used oxen instead of horses
 regardless of what means of transportation that were used all were bound for the riches of the klondike the son
 of the old chief smith by thing for us that we were camped out name who could speak a little
 english and travelling all winter because our and all of us could smatter a little friends whom we had left
 at the lake and chinook informed us that his squaw who had been denned up and taking was sick and
 wanted to know if we had little or no exercise during the winter a medicine man with us knowing the
 were practically all on the verge of peculiarities of the coast indians in scurvy while we were healthy and regard
 to medicine and remembering the strong even if we were thin we did not wonderful medicine chest which reid enjoy
 our cabin very long because the had brought from chicago reid had signs of spring compelled us to start on
 taken a course in medicine we informed the 17 th of march on the portage of fifty smith that we
 had a doctor and next miles over to pelly banks on the pelly day we rigged up this medicine chest
 river on a toboggan in the most beautifullycolored blanket that we possessed and we were in excellent trim for this
 trip while cinnamon and i took the rope to and took the lead in breaking the road draw it we
 told jack that he was to walk our friends whom we had left at the behind and give the appearance
 of being lake during the winter and who had a man with wonderful knowledge of taken no exercise had a
 hard time of it medicine and order around cinnamon we arrived at the pelly early in april and myself as
 his willing slaves it without any untoward incident except worked fine we were not in the indian for the fact
 that i was snow blind part camp just a short distance across the of the time upon arriving at pelly
 banks river more than half an hour before we settled down and made a boat and every blessed one of
 the tribe was cough shot squirrels as cur meat supply was ing and had an ailment of some kind exhausted
 and for the balance of our they were simply mad about medicine grub we were on half rations we had
 a and believed that the white man s medi long wait here the ice not going out of cine could
 cure anything we told jack the river until the 23 rd day of may we before going over to give
 them all kinds left the following day six boats in all of medicines but for heaven s sake not and
 had an easy time on the last leg of to give them any poison they received the journey the only
 difficulty was quinine and sulphur in abundance and portaging around hoole canyon a very even pink pills for pale people
 after dangerous and treacherous bit of water spending almost the entire day while one boat did really run the canyon
 liciht reid was compelled to feel the pulses without any load with four men at the and endeavor to locate
 imaginary ail oars the pilot was jack russell a man ments we returned that evening well who was for some
 years pilot on the satisfied with our day s work two days athabasca for mcdougall and secord afterwards the indians
 true to their this daring bunch of fellows joshed and traditions came over to our camp in a dared one
 another to make the trip until body with a potlach each to the medi finally they ventured forth we took
 cine man who had done so much for posts on the top of the hillside or canyon them as they
 thought the biggest gift side and watched the attempt their from the great hunter smith was the ham boat filled
 with water twice the second of a moose and every indian according time it filled was when they went over
 to their station or size had a chunk of the cascade the onlookers thought then moose meat down even to
 the little that they had seen the last of those papoose in arms whose contribution fellows however they came out
 safely would be about three pounds we were but pale from the fright russell renow living on the fat of
 the land marked afterwards no more of that we commenced our journey up the for me river in easy stages
 keeping in mind from there to selkirk it was easy that we had extra loads now to relay going and
 at selkirk we received the we were followed closely by the indians first news for about eight months of what
 who were anxious not to lose sight of dr jack we got back to our cabin at was going on
 in the outside world we the lake on the 15 th of march and i might arrived at dawson city
 the first week say here that i believe it was a lucky in june after a trip of many thrills
 when the ill fated riel rebellion began to crumble early in may 1885 its instigator louis riel surrendered to the
 canadian forces he was taken to regina and on may 23 rd he was placed in custody of supt r
 burton deane of the north west mounted police to await trial of charges of treason supt deane refused to allow
 the prisoner to see any visitors unless they carried a permit from the prime minister the result was that only
 the lawyers had access to riel before the trial opened on july 20 th riel expecting the support of quebec
 had hoped to see reporters and sympathizers in the days before the trial but none came in his melancholy he
 began to write poetry both in english and in his native french he had written much poetry during his lifetime
 some of which was published in a book poesies religieuses et politiques but most of his poems had been in
 french and almost all were on a deeply religious theme however while in jail his poems took a different note
 in an attempt to carry his messages to those in authority the one reproduced here was written to supt deane
 on june 8 th it is a plea to be permitted to write of his experiences as a means of
 raising money for his family deane forwarded a copy to the prime minister which is now contained in the papers
 of sir john a macdonald north west rebellion volume no 4 p 415 in the public archives of canada ottawa
 the poem was addressed to the commanding officer of the mounted police in regina and is signed very respectfully l

 election by a h mcquarrie someone has written that truth is stranger than fiction and i think that axiom applies
 fittingly to many of the things which happened in the early years of settlement of the peace river country to
 me the happenings of the summer of 1913 appear the strangest to some of the present residents that year may
 appear to be very far in the past but to me it seems very close it was a provincial election
 year and his cabin door he was however an the election in the peace river constitu enigma in that he
 would go to almost ency was a deferred one the constitu any length to confuse a political party ency was
 very large comprising an area to which he was opposed comparable to the areas of the provinces in the 1913
 election he was supportof new brunswick and nova scotia corn ing the conservatives and according to bined but of course
 much of it unsettled christie they met one morning on the the same area now consists of the con c
 n r station platform in edmonton stituencies of grande prairie peace near the time the train for athabasca river and
 spirit river with the differ was due to pull out then naturally disence that in the early days the boundary
 cussed politics and election matters and between the peace river district and the this man whom i shall call bob
 en clearwater district was the correction quired of christie how he thought the line between townships 70 and 71 sev
 election in the peace river district would eral years later the clearwater constitu go christie replied that things did not
 ency was eliminated and the northern look favorable but that if the election part was merged with peace river and
 there had been deferred they would have the southern part with pembina but had a better chance to organize more
 about this later much of the bob then enquired if it could not be northern part of the present peace
 river deferred christie pointed out a man to district is still unsettled him and said there is the m an
 going to i have no personal knowledge of peace river with the election writ in why or how the peace
 river election his pocket if you can get the writ the was deferred but i will repeat as nearly election
 will be deferred bob then as i can a story told by the late frank asked if he would not
 send him to peace christie who was for several years the river but this christie refused to do the dominion
 government land agent bob then said he would go to athaat grande prairie mr christie had been basca at that
 time the easiest way to a brilliant lawyer but he gave up the travel to peace river from edmonton practice
 of law for work more to his lik was by train to athabasca thence by ing at a convention of
 officials of the steam boat on the athabasca river as department of the interior his ability far as mirror landing
 thence on the was noticed by the deputy minister who lesser slave river to sawridge as the had him transferred
 to ottawa where he village at the east end of lesser slave remained until his death lake was called at
 that time and from in 1913 however he was the provin there over the lake a distance of seventyfive or
 eighty miles to grouard from cial organizer for the conservative party grouard the route was over the ninety his story
 like many others of the north converges around a certain well known miles of trail cut out many years ago
 for the hudson s bay company by a real old doer of good deeds a man who must timer tom
 kerr remain nameless but who always tried to uphold the honor of the trail and who at athabasca bob decided
 to go on like twelve foot davis never locked to grouard and he and the official alexander hugh mcquarrie was
 first employed by the 7 orth west territorial government in saskatchewan and came to alberta in 1907 he was inspector
 bridge and road builder for tire old depart ment of public works his efforts continually carried 151771 northward until he
 was district engineer for the whole peace river district when he retired in 1939 mr mcquarrie moved to ontario and
 now lives at 546 park street north in peterborougli occupied the same state room on the steam boat which was
 owned and run by the late jim cornwall of peace river fame no doubt the man enjoyed bob s company
 for he was a good entertainer and all went well until they were a considerable distance out on the lake
 when the official reported that his grip was missing mr cornwall was very indignant and questioned every one but without
 solving the mystery and the election was deferred mr christie said that some time later the official asked him what
 he thought bob did with his grip christie did not know but he promised to ask him the first time
 he saw him he did so and bob said i looked in the grip and there was not much in
 it besides a night shirt and the writ so i put a marlin spike in it and shoved it out
 through the porthole and it is on the bottom of lesser slave lake that is christie s story i hope
 i will be pardoned for making personal references for i wish to say that contrary to general thought at the
 time i was not in the district for political reasons my presence there was purely coincidental for i was carrying
 out work which the late john stocks the deputy minister of public works told me as early as 1911 that
 he would be preparing for me to do if i had taken any part in the election i believe he
 would have taken a dim view of it for i knew he looked with disfavor on the acts of any
 government employees very few in numbers who had done so when i returned to edmonton and reported to him he
 remarked that complaints had been received because i had not taken any part in the election campaign i replied that
 what he had been told was correct i was bold enough to tell him that i had heard similar reports
 about him chiefly in the edson district even to the effect that he would be fired because he would not
 take part actively in political affairs he replied you can hear that right here in edmonton they can go right
 to it any time they like he was not fired and a year or two later he was given a
 much higher salaried position in the service i feel safe in saying that during my many years in the public
 service i kept 0 15 the author is shown here during a trip along the edson trail in april 1911
 left to right are j d robertson a h mcquarrie and lames cornwall member of the legislature for the peace
 river district free of political and religious entanglements generally with more discomfort to myself than to anyone else i served
 under seven ministers of public works all of whom have gone to their eternal rest and i can say emphatically
 that not one of them had ever suggested to me that i should take any part in politics while i
 was in the service in this connection i wish to pay a tribute to the late doctor charlesworth when he
 was deputy minister of public works i mentioned that some people were continually putting pressure on me to inject some
 politics into my work his reply was to fight that to the last ditch referring again to what took place
 in mr stocks office on my return to edmonton he suggested that it might be as well for me to
 write an outline of what i had been doing in case the matter got hot just at that moment his
 secretary announced that the hon charles stewart was outside and wished to see him i prepared to leave but mr
 stocks told me not to go mr stocks prestige in the government service was so high that he rarely was
 asked to go to a minister s office the ministers would go to him after mr stewart had come in
 mr stocks mentioned he had been talking to me about my actions in the north and the complaints he had
 received mr stewart said now what has mcquarrie been doing i replied that what i had not done appeared to
 be more offensive than what i had done and my worst offence was not having arranged for the workers on
 the edson trail south of sturgeon lake to be taken to the poll at that point to vote for the
 government candidate i also said that i had told the foreman that if any of his men were entitled to
 vote and wished to do so we must not put any obstacle in their way the foreman said he would
 let them know but added that he would not vote because he had not been in the country long enough
 to cast an intelligent one mr stocks wryly remarked that an unintelligent vote is some times preferred i did not
 tell them that i thought the poll at sturgeon lake was an illegal one this is something which i do
 not think many if any persons in the constituency realized i thought at the time that it was put there
 by design but i feel sure now that there was no intention of wrong doing but that it was due
 to a lack of knowledge of the geography of the district at that time with the exception of the settlements
 at sturgeon lake and a narrow strip of land along the bank of the smoky river the area east of
 that river was unsurveyed and it was taken for granted that the settlements were in the peace river constituency actually
 the settlement was in clearwater and three miles south of the peace river constituency boundary it was not until the
 1917 election that an arrangement was made for the voters there to have an opportunity to vote for a clearwater
 candidate what this fluke might have done in the confusion that followed the 1913 election if the authorities had known
 about it is hard to imagine probably it is as well that they did not know about it since no
 wrong doing was intended mr stewart described to mr stocks many of the things he had noticed and some of
 the shenanigans that had taken place and it was not necessary for me to make any further comments when i
 was leaving mr stocks told me not to trouble writing him anything about them at that time mr stewart was
 minister of municipal affairs later he was made minister of public works and then became premier and finally he was
 minister of the interior in the dominion government in 1913 he made a trip through the peace river district and
 held meetings in the main towns in the interest of the government candidate in the election he had some embarrassing
 moments i will cite only one instance which i did not hear about until 1917 when mr stewart was in
 peace river between trains during the election that year i was attending to some work a few miles from town
 when mr stewart sent a messenger to tell me he would like to see me about some local project i
 met him in the royal hotel and we had the matter settled in a few minutes while a trip to
 the peace river district was a slow and difficult task before the railway here a h mcquarrie centre and john
 stocks deputy minister of public works left stop with a band of indians at sturgeon lake early in 1911 we
 were discussing it a chap came in so they hid the case the next day where and made some proposition
 to him that the driver could pick it up and take it was not entirely above board stewart back to
 grouard on his return trip put him off by saying you old repro they arrived at peace river in the
 bate you got me into trouble once and evening and the whole populace includ i am going to see you
 don t do so again ing inspector anderson was out to meet the man and i left the hotel together
 them the inspector s greeting was it and i asked him what mr stewart meant is all right about the
 whiskey mr stewby his remarks and he told me this story art our man at grouard wired that you in
 1913 mr stewart came to grouard forgot the permit but he saw it you can by boat from athabasca hugh
 hunter use the whiskey and frank stuart had arranged for a i am inclined to think that some of driver
 with team and buck board wagon the people thought mr stewart was exto take him to peace river they had
 tremely stingy with it also arranged with the driver to take a the actions or perhaps antics would case of
 liquor to their friends at peace be a better description leading to the river nomination of candidates in 1913 were
 at that time the only way liquor indeed strange but finally things simcould be legally brought into the coun mered
 down and three were nominated try was by special permit and this they these were f bredin as an independent
 had arranged liberal i believe a patterson as the a day or two after the driver left conservative candidate and
 w a rae grouard stuart found that he had the as the liberal government candidate permit in his pocket instead
 of having the campaign was rather bitter and pergiven it to the driver he and hunter sonalities were indulged in
 patterson was elected by a small then decided to see the mounted police officer stationed at that point and they
 margin but it was as if a bomb had told him that mr stewart was taking a fallen when it
 was discovered that a case of whiskey to peace river but had ballot box was missing when i was in
 forgotten to take the permit the officer the grande prairie district three years immediately wired inspector anderson a ago i
 was told that it had been found in burly dane who carried out his duties recent years in an old
 abandoned well to the very last letter of the law and who the troubles and worries of a w played
 no favorites carveth the returning officer were complicated still more because the chief in the meantime mr stewart and his
 election clerk disappeared without comdriver were making their way through pleting or signing the necessary forms the mud and mire
 of the old grouard he was not found and did not return to trail towards peace river the last night
 the district until several months later it out they put up at a stopping place at was generally thought that
 his actions little prairie those who knew mr stew were deliberately planned and i will say art intimately knew that
 he was a man here that i am sure that over 95 percent of temperate habits and not given to
 the of the liberals were just as indignant use of liquor about it as the conservatives as he and his
 driver were outside to conclude briefly i need only to during the evening the driver remarked say that the legal
 procedure that had that he thought the whiskey would be to be taken covered several months and all right in
 the buck board during the mr patterson did not take his seat in night stewart very much surprised the first
 session of the legislature held asked is that whiskey the driver after the election i met him in edmonton said
 it was and asked him it he did not that winter and he told me he was not have the
 permit he replied that he did worried greatly about losing his sesnot know anything about it the driver sional indemnity
 for he could do without then told him what he knew and said it and he had no fault to
 find with the they must do something about it because government because he knew they were the mounted police would
 check them doing all they could to get the matter when they arrived at peace river settled his remarks about
 those who stewart said he would not for the caused all the trouble were not so world have anything like

 musicale a ludicrous incident happened during the theatrical performance the other evening miss roberts ascended the platform to sing and
 while she was singing those famed verses two dogs one an elderly gentleman like looking animal and the other a
 semi stupidonery jet black overgrown pup with flat like ears and a head like a coal scuttle gravely took up
 positions one on each side of the singer at first the occurrence did not attract much attention but a gentle
 titter was heard and then another and then another then there was a succession of them in which the singer
 participated then there was one long loud prolonged roar of laughter and the lady fled while the cause of the
 interruption sat on their tails and contemplated the picture before them as if they would like to know what it
 was all about as the roars of laughter increased in loudness the junior animal began to get nervous and to
 show signs of retreat the senior however while gazing at the audience maintained a dignity and a coolness that showed
 him to be a veteran without exhibiting any signs of fear or anger he concluded to investigate what was behind
 the curtain and in a calm dignified manner quite in keeping with his behaviour throughout strode behind the curtain through
 the curtain pushing it aside with the grace and ease of an actor his ungainly looking companion followed him in
 loose irregular ambling fashion rendered more ludicrous by the fear which had seized him the laughter deepened as they both
 disappeared and then miss roberts returned and sang her song without further interruption calgary nor wester oct 1884 fort dunvegan

 of the mcleods on the island of skye for many years it was a centre of the fur trade a
