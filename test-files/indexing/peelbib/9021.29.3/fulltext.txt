 law could not prevail by william beahen municipal government and law enforcement in the north west territories were in their
 infancy when a smallpox outbreak and anti chinese riot occurred in calgary in the summer of 1892 town authorities experienced
 difficulties in coping with this crisis and turned to a more experienced authority the north west mounted police although the
 police were wary of cooperation because of previous clashes with town officials especially the police chief they did act recognizing
 the necessity of protecting the country from spread of disease and of preserving law and order when threatened by mob
 violence inspector ar cuthbert comma nder of e division reasoned that mob law could not be allowed to prevail in
 the n w t even in a municipality when the nwmp first arrived at calgary in 1875 they had sole
 responsibility for policing the area but with the creation of the urban municipality of calgary in 1884 came the power
 for the local council to pass bylaws to regulate the order and morality of the town and to appoint policemen
 to enforce them 2 thus the following year 1885 the calgary police department was established the north west mounted police
 continued to exercise authority for enforcement of federal statutes and n w t ordinances in the town 3 but in
 practice they withdrew from acting within the municipality except in cooperation with town police or when a serious crime obviously
 violated more than a municipal bylaw 4 in this way town council used its four man police force to determine
 the balance of vice and morality to be allowed in the frontier community and to collect revenue from the imposition
 of fines the larger 70 man force of mounted police stationed at calgary was left free to patrol the outlying
 district but after the appointment of a new chief of police tom english in l 890 a conflict arose with
 the mounted police over the degree of licence to be allowed in the community by reports chief english was a
 big brawling man with a dominant personality and not inclined to a severe imposition of law and order this approach
 may have been a realistic appraisal of the wants and needs of the calgary s 4 000 citizens but it
 began to have a detrimental effect on the internal discipline of e division the district unit of the mounted police
 this chinese servant lee bang was photographed in calgary a year after the anti chinese riot for example lottie carkeek
 alias dutch lottie alias lottie diamond alias lottie sargent a keeper of a house of ill fame helped to ruin
 the careers of a mounted police sergeant and the author is staff historian for the rcmp in ottawa a sergeant
 major the former being reduced to this precautionary arrangement was soon constable before quitting the force and the latter threatened
 by the friction existing between the having his personal life reduced to a shambles town authorities and the mounted police
 the when the mounted police tried to gain the co agreed procedure for supplying the camp was operation of the
 town police in putting lottie out that the town authorities would deliver goods to a of business chief of police
 english was reluctant point outside the quarantine grounds but within to do anything for some reason best known to reach
 of camp attendants thus ensuring that no himself the pressure for action continued contact would be made but on the
 evening of until the madam was arrested and fined for keep july 4 chief english drove a wagon load of
 ing a house of ill fame but the nominal fine of supplies straight into camp and proceeded to 50 was
 no real deterrent visit wit h those detained there 4 then when the mounted police had failed in their attempt
 english thed to leave he was stopped by sgt to drive lottie carkeek out of business 8 what dee of
 the nwmp acting on orders that anyone had been accomplished was to create enmity having unnecessary contact with those infected
 between chief tom english and the mounted were to be kept in quarantine english was not police with the former
 said to be considering persuaded by this argument and responded with suing cuthbert for libel for accusing him of pro
 a string of curses and the claim that there were tecting a prostitute 9 the suit was not made but
 not enough mounted police in the country to english got a measure of revenge on the hold him the chief
 then assaulted sgt dee and by inspiring a story in the calgary tribune that had to be restrained by force
 inspector cuthbert an officious mounted policeman had almost was notified and he authorized the release of trampled a mentally deficient
 lad at a local athle english when mayor lucas agreed in writing to tic association games the article commented assume
 responsibility for editorially the mounted police then had chief english charged with assault but the crown prosecutor it would be
 far better indeed if the mounted police said he would not press the case because he did were kept to
 their legitimate duties there was not the slightest necessity of their presence at the games not wish to make an
 enemy of english 6 and yesterday to maintain order and in future the town although the mayor assured cuthbert that
 engpolice who are paid for doing town duly should be lish would be severely dealth with he doubted required to
 perform that ty 0 the outcome because municipal authorities had it turned out that the boy had been interfering shown
 little backbone in dealing with the wit h runners in a race and had been accidently policeman 7 the trial
 began on july 12 with the knocked down by a mounted policeman who chief pleading not guilty nd it was
 immediately was trying to clear him from the course at the postponed because two of the defence witnesses request of
 the organizers the editor of the were inmates of the quarantine camp 8 newspaper apologized privately to inspector the incident
 caused the mounted police to cuthbert for the article explaining that it had consider withdrawing from their role in enforcebeen
 placed in the newspaper without his know ment of the quarantine three days after the ledge by a reporter acting
 for chief english 2 assault inspector cuthbert notified mayor on june 30 1892 a chinese man working at a lucas
 that he would recall the mounted policelaundry on stephen avenue was found to be suf men from guard duty at
 the quarantine grounds feting from smallpox considerable feeling as soon as the town could provide substitutes 9 against the chinese
 was aroused among the citi lucas responded that in his view the responsibzenry for having introduced this disease in their
 ility for dealing with the disease lay with the midst the municipa l board of health acted federal government and
 not the town because the quickly by setting up a quarantine camp across smallpox was brought in from the coast
 he said nose creek for the patient and for the other that the mounted police services were appreciatoccupants of the
 house and by burning the build ed by calgarians and must continue ing and its contents mayor alexander lucas the
 question of governmental responsibility hen appealed to the mounted police to guard the was confused because quarantine had not been
 camp both to keep the chinese inside and others proclaimed under the provisions of the n w t away when
 he pointed out that the quarantine infectious diseases ordinance arrangements was in the national interest as well as that of
 the for the quarantine had been made by the munilocality cuthbert immediately complied 3 cipal board of health as a
 local precaution 2 as a thomas english the controversial chief of the calgary police is seen here front and centre
 with members of the force and magistrates result the mounted police had no official role in occurring not only in
 calgary but in british controlling the outbreak but finally by july 22 columbia and other parts of the territory as
 the disease spread in calgary town authorities in calgary the initial reaction from citizens were forced to publicly admit to
 the infection was to run the chinese out of town but this a nd the lieutenant governor set up a
 territorial attitude abated when the quarantine was estabhealth district to deal with it under this regula lished in fact there
 was no publicity about the tion any peace officer was authorized to enforce disease in calgary newspapers for the first
 two he quarantine and so the mounted police were weeks probably because a growing town does more officially committed to
 act not like to advertise its shortcomings this the first case of smallpox had appeared in a changed in mid
 july when the three fresh cases man who had just arrived from china in april were reported rapid anti chinese
 sentiments his illness had not been reported to the authori began to be expressed and the first ominous ties for
 a month and by hat time a second man in warning of the violence came on july 19 when the
 household had been infected three days the calgary herald warned the town s health after the cases were discovered a
 white ma n committee to consult with citizens about what to who had his washing done at the laundry was
 do with the chinese when they were to be refound to have contracted the disease after the leased from qurantine
 the local feeling is incident with chief english no new cases were strong against the race and it is well
 for the reported until mid july when suddenly there authorities to recognize the fact if the chinamen were three more
 one a white woman just arriv now at the quarantine be sent back into town ed from british columbia there
 will be trouble the spread of the disease engendered consid the reaction of some of calgary s citizens to erable
 anxiety in calgary manifesting itself in the appearance of smallpox in their midst was to part by outbursts of hostility
 towards the town s take temporary leave of the town inspector chinese residents the chinese were not very cuthbert characterized
 these departures as a popular with whites in canada who rega rded great exodus 25 the winnipeg industrial them as
 bearers of disease and source of every exhibition was being held at this time and large sort of vice from
 gambling to drugs to enslave numbers of calgarians took the opportunity to ment of white girls for prostitution these atti
 visit it tudes were reinforced by the knowledge hat among the holiday makers was the unco opsmallpox was imported from
 china and was erative chief of police tom english the chief the riot would stave off any further trouble 34
 but he was wrong the chinese continued to receive threats that unless they left town their properties would be burned
 and they would receive personal injury the editor of the calgary tribune who was considered to favour the chinese was
 also warned his building would be burned under pressure from some more broad minded elements of the community the council
 asked the mounted police to shelter the chinese and then patrol the town but their own sentiments were clearly with
 the mob 35 town officials refused to prosecute the three men arrested the night of the riot 36 and to
 seek out the leader s of the mob 37 later mayor lucas confessed that he understood the feelings of the
 rioters against the chinese because by secretly sheltering a smallpox victim they had endangered the whole community he thought that
 the whites had some rights as well as chinamen 38 when several clergymen petitioned town council to denounce the actions
 of the rioters council would not comply as requested both unofficially by respectable members of the community and officially by
 town council the nwrvip began to patrol calgary regularly on aug 5 reinforcements were rushed to e division and mounted
 and dismounted patrols were in town day and night cuthbert was concerned that cowmen might be brought in left calgary
 on july 23 26 originally for one week in winnipeg but he found private business to attend to and gained
 an extension of his leave 27 not returning until aug 9 28 it was most curious and inopportune of calgary
 s chief of police to take his holidays at such a critical juncture in the town s history there was
 a hiatus in the spread of the disease but the end of july saw the sudden appearance of hree more
 cases two in the quarantine camp and one a woman in the cpr community of shepherd nine more people were
 brought into the calgary quarantine grounds from shepherd and a separate health district set up at that place policed by
 the nwmp 29 three people died a mother and her newly born infant and a pregnant woman who also suffered
 a miscarriage after contracting the disease as the calgary herald had warned the release of several chinese from quarantine on
 aug 2 triggered a riot among white calgarians the trouble started at a banquet after a cricket match between two
 local clubs excessive drinking was followed by a decision to demonstrate against the return of the chinese a mob of
 about 200 gathered in the streets of calgary by about 11 p m the mob then descended on the chinese
 district destroying property assaulting several chinese residents and by some reports stealing money from the outset no attempt was made
 by the town s two constables nor any other municipal authority to stop he riot anticipating trouble cuthbert earlier had
 notified the council of the release of the chinese from quarantine and mayor lucas had promptly left town when the
 rioting did break out he was nowhere to be found cuthbert believed this was a deliberate act by lucas who
 was in league with the mob leaders several respectable citizens however including town councillor w h cushing who was also
 a member of the police commission asked the mounted police to act cuthbert was prepared to move on the town
 anyway citing violations of federal statutes but this request gave a semblance of local support as well cuthbert gave shelter
 to chinese fleeing the violence that night then took a squad of police to town at the approach of the
 small force the ringleaders disappeared and the police picked up hree quarrelsome men from the mob which then dispersed the
 police continued in town on patrol until 4 a m cuthbert at first thought that the dispersal of lnsp a

 a black person was an unusual sight for most calgarians since there were so few of them in the city
 nd since there was no television until the 1950 s despite being called names and suffering some discrimination mrs anderson
 emphasizes that overall life in calgary has been good to her 2 the arrival during the late 1960 s and
 the 1 970 s of several thousand blacks from the west indies and a few from africa has had little
 impact on the blacks already in alberta the alberta born blacks feel little sense of kinship with the new arrivals
 and no particular desire to identify with them consequently there re almost no institutional links between the two groups west
 indian blacks who now greatly outnumber the native born blacks have their own distinctive culture and have established carnibean associations
 together with whites from the carribean in order to fully understand the black experience in alberta one must compare it
 to the experience of other immigrant groups and to the experience of blacks elsewhere in north america in some ways
 the history of alberta blacks has been similar to that of other ethnic and racial groups in the province the
 rural pioneer struggles and achievements the establishment of familiar institutions to help cope with a new life the rural urban
 transition the shift from refugee consciousness to a strong identification with canada all are part of a pattern that has
 been repeatedly followed by many ethno cultural groups now part of alberta s population but alberta blacks have also faced
 problems a nd issues which have affected few other groups although stereotypes existed and evolved surrounding almost every group that
 came to the province he stereotype about blacks has been among the most highly developed despite the small number of
 blacks in the province black families began coming after the turn of the century albertans already had an entire rsenal
 of reasons as to why they didn t want them in the province while most albertans had virtually no previous
 contact with blacks because of the proximity of the united states they had ma ny notions about blacks in general
 and these notions were largely racist according to the popularized pseudo scientific dogma about race which prevailed until world war
 two and lingered for some years afterward blacks were at the very bottom of the world wide racial pecking order
 other groups in alberta encountered prejudice because of cultural linguistic po litical or religious differences or because of particular wartime
 alignments but blacks encounter ed prejudice simply because of the color of their skin did the american blacks who came
 to alberta s cities find the haven of tolera nce for which they hoped the record reveals that they encountered
 considerable prejudice but except for the province wide reaction in 1911 it was localized sporadic and largely unorganized what is
 more important the prejudice that existed was never formalized into law and only once erupted into violence undoubtedly given prevailing
 attitudes toward blacks in alberta the key variable in explaining the better position of blacks living in the province as
 compared to that of blacks in many other parts of north america has been their small numbers althoug h there
 wer e far too few blacks for po liticians to court their votes they were also too few for politicians
 to appeal to prejudice against them as a way of attracting white votes blacks in alberta were seldom a public
 issue except for very brief pe riods they were not perceived as an economic political or cultural threat for the
 most part blacks wer e simply ignored paradoxically however their small numbers are the result in part of prejudice restrictive

 a winter or two hunting in the mountains west of morley up the bow river pass then considered to be
 a long distance back of nowhere and erected a shanty to live in the stories which pete had to tell
 about his experiences or those winters and amount of geographical topographical mineralogical and other information that would exude from him
 during the telling were simply marvellous and were received by an incredulous nd apathetic public as guff not the least
 wonderful or least frequently mentioned feature of pete s camp were certain hot springs impregnated as he alleged with magnesia
 and sulphur upon the virtues of which he used to dilate to an immense extent but the aforesaid public was
 individually and collectively too sharp to take any stock in pete or his yarns terribly cute people out west so
 the spr ings were left to waste their sweetness on the desert air and pete himself advised to quit talking
 about them and give the public a rest in process of time the cpr was built through the bow river

 his cricket bat at our house but of course he never returned after a few years the children commenced arriving
 and a new phase of my parents life began their first child died in infancy but llewellyn arthur stanley ralph
 and melville arrived between 1908 and 1914 while i arrived on the scene in 1919 mother whose father had served
 as a missionary clergyman in the trinity bay area of newfoundland was a very devoted member of the anglican church
 and it was as a matter of course that we were sent to church every sunday getting us all fed
 dressed in our best and to church in time for the eleven o clock service must have been a great
 chore but i have no doubt that she got much personal satisfaction from bringing us up in this manner when
 a boys choir was being organized at all saints cathedral then a basement church on 103 rd street the organist
 vernon barford and the rector mr pierce goulding obviously decided that recruitment could be simplified by arbitrarily enrolling all the
 choir aged boys in the sunday school on a particular sunday morning when the announcement was made to the sunday
 school my brother ralph made local history by escaping the draft via a basement window he was not allowed to
 escape serving his church though and remained the crucifer until he joined the rcmp melville became a chorister and later
 i followed in their footsteps and took over from ralph until i joined the navy in 1940 mother s family

 spent weeks recovering from an illness on a cot in our dining room none of the hungry young men who
 knocked on our door during the depression was ever turned away they were riding the rods and came in from
 the railroad track during this time father who had a family of growing boys had very few clothes but any
 the author s parents arthur jones and elizabeth petley were photographed on their wedding day in calgary in 1905 father
 and mother purchased a frame house built in 1899 with three lots on the corner of 104 th street and
 saskatchewan avenue later 97 th avenue the house originally faced on 104 th street but when the edmonton yukon and
 pacific railway came through it was moved to a new foundation facing 97 th avenue old fort edmonton was still
 in existence nd our house was three city blocks to the east the legislative building had not yet been built
 and when it was the old fort was no doubt considered an eyesore it was pulled down in 1916 during
 their first years in edmonton my parents met many nova scotians and others with similar interests a nd were able
 to continue their edwardian way of life as if they had never left eastern canada with their congenial group of
 friends they enjoyed teas and tennis parties skating in winter and joined the many young men from england and eastern
 canada who enjoyed playing cricket entertaining at home was a frequent recreational activity on one occasion a distant r elative
 arrived for a quiet family dinner wearing his dinner jacket and black bow tie the west was not going to
 change his way of doing things another englishma n who was a frequent visitor was the explorer jack hornby who
 perished with two very young englishman on the last thing he could spare was given to those who were vanished
 when i was a small boy i can remember in desperate need these young men were fit the indians coming
 past our house to the hudted out in our basement before continuing heir son s bay field which was between
 102 and journey up the tracks 103 rd street on 97 th avenue for several days then there were the
 dances organized by a each summer this field became an indian village cousin during his pe riodic visits to edmonton

 administered by the brothers and their friends would clear the dining indian agent mr cooper he was a friend of
 room and drawing room of all unnecessary flirn father s so we were fortunate in being able to iture and

 happy to pump the the encampment life of the indians at first hand player piano thus ensuring a later than
 usual for a little boy it was an impressive and bedtime sometimes frightening experience i can vividly my brothers and

 their absence when the snow clearing was under in addition to all these pets i won a dartmoor way we
 made our ring by surrounding the tennis pony as the first prize in an essay contest on the court with
 a three foot board fence as soon as life of the prince of wales poor dad had to weather permitted
 in the fall preparing the rink build a small carefully insulated stable behind for flooding always took place on hallowe
 en the house the lumber cost 50 a considerable night i think that it was dad s way of keeping
 the expenditure in 1933 a depression year my boys busy and out of trouble on that particular brother liewellyn was
 becoming a well known night a string of overhead lights extended our local artist at this time and i was
 very proud when skating parties and hockey games until well after he took time off from painting portraits and dark
 landscapes around edmonton to execute an oil we also sent skiing on the slopes of parliament painting of my pony
 hill some of us used barrel staves or home made the old days in edmonton had not entirely skis while
 a few of the more affluent sported 4 f the author is seen here with his lather at their rossdale
 home in 1933 they are standing on the family s skating rink store bought skis with primitive harness there was
 no such thing as a ski tow and one had to remove one s skis and carry them back to
 the top of he hill after each straight daring downhill dash as a result skiing was never very popular we
 only practiced it when the weather was suitable and in order to have a change from skating tobogganing or bob
 sleighing bob sleighing was very popular with teenage boys most bobs were home made and many happy but reckless rides
 were taken from the parliament hill where one gained the speed necessary to propel one at great speed down an
 icy 97 th avenue a heavily loaded bob sleigh would almost get to donald ross school a r ide of
 about five blocks one must remember that there was little winter motor traffic in those days and we had to
 avoid collision with horse drawn sleighs pedestrians the odd ca r and of cour se the street car which ran
 up and down 97 th avenue about every half hour the only blind crossing was at 105 th street in
 retrospect it is amazing but i cannot recall any serious accident with other vehicles at times i used to watch
 for the fme turnout of the hudson s bay company horses and wagons which passed our house on their way
 from their stables on 102 nd street to the uptown store on jasper avenue the horses were all light coloured
 palominos with well groomed manes and tails their wagons were green with gold trim and lettering all kept in beautiful
 condition in winter sleighs were used and the sound of the harness bells added to the delight of the elegant
 show a heavier type of horse and wagon were used by the arctic ice company which had its large ice
 house on the flats south of donald ross school the ice was cut during the late winter when about two
 feet thick on a stretch of the river opposite the mayfair golf course during the harvest period the teams drawing
 long low sleighs loaded with blocks of ice could be seen coming down the centre of the river each day
 until the ice house was full there was no refrigeration at the plant the ice being packed in sawdust would
 keep until needed in the hot days of summer during the hot weather the same teams with smaller wagons would
 wend their way up 97 th avenue the wagons covered with canvas to protect the ice from the sun s
 rays they would deliver small blocks of ice to residents homes a block large enough to fill the ice box
 costing 25 cents there were many so called characters who lived in edmonton then but to me the most exciting
 and when very young somewhat frightening person was a hermit who lived quite literally in the south bank of the
 saskatchewan river about half a mile west of the high level bridge i now wonder who he was and what
 he did for a living at the time we thought that it was a mystery which did not necessitate any
 investigation maybe he was one of the men who panned for gold this was quite a conmion sight along the
 river banks during the depression years in his dirty old clothes which seemed to hang from his shoulders and his
 long hair and full beard a rare sight in the late twenties and early thirties he often walked along he
 railroad tracks on his way to and from town he never spoke nor seemed to pay any attention to us
 as he passed and in turn we would never have thought of speaking to him he was to remain an
 unknown figure who added to the varied scene in rossdale during the period from 1904 to 1940 the majority of
 the residents of the area were of scots english irish and welsh descent we also had some ukrainian neighbours on
 the other side of the high level bridge were the extensive market and soccer in the west at that time
 baseball was ga rdens well farmed by chinese these gardens king at diamond park situated just below maca nd their
 produce were considered a great asset to donald hill soccer in the summer and canadian the neighbourhood rugby in the
 fall were played to sell out crowds at renfrew park this park covered a square block donald ross school stood
