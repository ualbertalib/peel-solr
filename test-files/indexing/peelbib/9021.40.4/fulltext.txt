 indian was permitted to have intoxicating spent most of his life at sea and who in drink in his her

 or otherwise in that year we used to obtain our recruits furnishing booze to others were subject mainly from winnipeg
 where we had a to imprisonment or a heavy fine of which recruiting office and the recruits in under the
 liquor law half went to the question used to be sent on to the head informant who supplied the evidence

 police were willing to buck as he told me by some trouble at so unpopular that few outside the ranks

 a violator was grossly anti social behaviour liquor informer who had been commit the mounties themselves were unhappy ted for
 trial on a charge of shooting at an j k f u a about the state of affa irs since
 it was indian and who had been giving liquor impossible to enforce the law and their to other indians attempts
 to do so brought them little but i said nothing but knew of course he den i ation from the

 determined should have a run for his his family which he was seeking he life whatever happened would by undertaking
 the detective to this end when col maclend had duty probably be able to earn a few hun gone i
 looked up a sergeant of ours i cautioned him that in dred dollars he was in a very dishevelled named
 connon whom i intended to condition with long unkempt hair and i send to macleod to help mr bush in
 his the interval he should talk sent him away for a few hours to think it extremity i knew there
 was one lawyer over and to give me time to speak to the commissioner about practising in maclend but had
 not heard as lit t i e as po s si b i e to of their being another and
 something i cautioned him that in the interval he had to be done without loss of time anyone and should
 leave should talk as little as possible to anyone some little time previously i had asked and should leave his
 hair long if he found sergeant connon if he would care to his hair long if he found himself cornered
 in the barrack room he supplement his income by teaching my was to say that he was going on some
 two boys in his spare time at his conve h i m self c o r n e red i

 forty miles west of regina lying on his bed reading horace he said barrack room he was to he made
 up his mind to take the chance teaching was not in his line so there was in view of the
 money that might be nothing more to be said he had been a say that he was going on earned
 and in order to cover his tracks lawyer of repute in ontario but had locally i sent him to moose
 jaw where he broken with all his former connections so m e spec i a i d u ty to
 was to buy sund ry articles of attire which and taken service with the mounted he needed from there he
 was to go on police because he had liked whisky too moose jaw to calgary and take the stage to
 maclend well and the west was a prohibition which lay some 104 miles to the south country anyway he was
 a good sound ward he was furnished with funds the lawyer as i had had occasion to discover necessary credentials
 and a letter which and to him i described joe bush s mishe was to deliver secretly to the com
 sion and his subsequent troubles as i had manding officer from whom he was to vaguely learnt them and commissioned
 take his instructions and to whom he him to travel to macleod with the was to make his reports stipendiary
 magistrate and at the trial to act as bush s counsel 7 he wrote a line to me from calgary
 to say that he would be known by the name of i may as well let bush tell his own
 story joe bush and i having much other busi in his own way by giving here the text of ness
 to attend to forgot all about him a letter which reached me two or three it was i think on
 the 2 nd november days after the occurrence just mentioned following that he was brought to my fort maclend mind
 again on that day col james f 6 th november 1884 maclend c m g came to barracks and private
 had a chat and a smoke with me 6 he dear captain deane was stipendiary magistrate for the district of
 macleod and had been to winnipeg i would have written you before but i from whence he was now returning
 home have been so bothered that i have not alberta history autumn 1992 i as i should wish to do
 i arrived down been able to settle down to anything time found out who the indian was and i now
 feel that it will be a difficult to try and make you understand ‘ s thing for me to explain
 matters to you about it i must go back before i went to stand off captain here on the tuesday
 after leaving cotton told me that there were two regina and put myself in communi men whom he wanted to
 catch called ‘ cation with captain cotton he told murray and pace 9 murray came into a me he was
 very sorry i had not arrived a week sooner as he had caused a raid town i saw him and
 told him i wished ‘ to he made on the whisky men which to visit stand off to look around
 had produced a scare and he did not the country and it was arranged that think i should catch anyone
 he should drive me out next day and i i found what he said was correct and that he would
 put me up there so accordingly next day i went there for the first ten days could not find with
 him and remained six days out much however during the next few days i caught four of them and during
 the first four nothing took then went down to stand off a place but on the fifth a man rode
 up place about 20 miles to the south of at noon and asked who lived there i here i remained
 there six days and told him mr murray after a little caught three more on my return to talk the
 stranger said it is strange maclend i learnt that some of the par you boys do not keep more whisky
 he declared that if he ties were likely to clear out so captain here and said he had five gallons
 of cotton had them all arrested they extra whisky which he would let us could get a man to collect
 were all convicted on my evidence have at 12 00 per gallon if we would and five of them were
 fined 200 take it on murray agreed to take four evidence and convict the each and the other two 100
 each 8 gallons of it and i one gallon the stranger then left saying he would liquor vendors he would
 after the trial i found that the whole bring the whisky at 7 o clock that town had gone next
 door to mad ‘ g at which time he arrived was evenin over it and if they could have caught
 paid 60 and left for maclend with send him out of the country me i think they would have lynched
 with great difficulty i some more me of course i thought that captain found out that his name was preston
 after his work was done cotton would have sent me away at once in fact on the second it was
 arranged that evening that with an escort if necessary evening after the trial he had everything murray should drive me
 into town arranged for me to go but at the last next day but that night he drank a of
 half his troop minute he altered his mind much good drop and the place was full of to my surprise
 all he told me was indians and next morning he said he that i need not mind he would see
 could not go to town but would send me safely off an indian to drive me he then employed me
 in the office now he was an indian about 18 years copying orders and nothing particular old who lives and
 sleeps entirely at this took place until the evening of the house so next day at about noon i seventh
 day i was then smoking a pipe started in a buckboard with the indian and all at once a sergeant
 came in and driving after we had driven some five read me a warrant accusing me of miles he all
 at once stopped and left shooting at an indian and i was lock the buckboard he kept me waiting ed
 up in the guard room amongst a about half an hour and then return above lot of whisky sellers etc
 and a nice ed we then drove on again a short superintendent john cotton time i spent of it i
 applied to see distance when he left me again just commanding officer at fort mac cod some officer but no
 i could see no in the same manner as before i was failed to protect joe bush once he had
 one until a few minutes before the particularly anxious to get into town informed on local whiskey sellers trial came
 off and i then for the first to see the man preston before he left fl alberta history autumn 992
 as i wanted to catch his partners as matter of fact i had not four charges well as himself so
 i got out of the buck with me i onl y had two when i left board and started to
 walk calculating stand off and these i fired as a that i had about 15 miles to go signal as
 i have before told you of course murray and pace were in a great when i had gone what i
 thought was rage at being caught as i had caught about 12 miles i could see nothing of them and
 on hearing of the complaint maclend and i knew it would soon be the first indian made have concocted dark
 so i felt uneasy at this time i the other charge against me 12 saw what i took to be
 two white men riding about 3 miles off and at the at the trial murray and pace both same time
 an indian came riding up swore i was drunk when i started to me i could understand nothing and the
 indian swore i was so drunk from him and as he rode off i fired that he was obliged to
 hold me in two shots from my revolver to try and the buckboard or i should have falattract the attention
 of the white len out and yet i managed to walk in men at the same time waving my hat
 15 or more miles over a prairie that i however they paid no attention and had only been on once
 before and soon were out of sight it became dark had then paid no attention to it as i and
 i gave myself up for lost but still expected to be driven back kept walking on after about an hour
 the whole thing is a lie and only on a i fancied i saw a li ght about 4 miles
 par with the other statements in the away on my left hand and at once paper that i was always
 drunk altered course and made for it but in a few minutes it disappeared how i used to visit captain
 cotton nearly ever i still kept on and after a bit i every night at 11 o clock he saw
 me saw another light and after an hour s constantly in the town and i kept a walking struck maclend
 diary of all that happened next morning i was standing in the murray s indian lives with him and street
 and an indian came up to me is most intelligent as murray says and through a man called casey one
 quite like a white in many of of those i got fined told me i had his ways fired at
 him and wanted some money of course i know nothing about the i told him that i had not fired
 at him law here but i am afraid things look and that i should give him nothing bad i should
 stand no chance before he then said he would go to the a maclend jury as the town is wild
 police and i told him it was the best against me after the examination i thing he could do shortly
 afterwards was kept for 5 days in the guard room murray s indian came into town before i got bail
 i am now out on brought me my things seemed partic 400 bail i have written this to you ularly
 good tempered had a glass of as i thought you would like to know lemonade with me and went away
 about it from me without making any complaint i remain now when captain cotton sent for yours most truly me
 out of the guard room just before the examination i was under the rishton saymon clark impression that it was
 the first indian p s it was 7 days before murray s who had lodged the complaint against indian lodged
 the complaint against me but to my surprise i found out me i should have put this in before that
 it was murray s indian who said but see i have not done so if i had i had fired
 four shots at him and made been sent off at once not a thing would a hole in his blanket
 11 of course all have taken place it was a mistake i could do was to deny it and as
 a kee ping me here jones was rig ht about the delay in filing was the view that lieutenant governor
 charges the alleged shooting had taken edgar dewdney expressed to sir john a p lace on october 15 but the
 charge was not macdonald a year later 5 one also might levied until october 23 the explanation speculate that the
 superintendent had given for the delay was that kaistatsaman caught wind of jones breaches of the law had to be
 hunted up on the blood reserve and thought it would be worse for the during the trial kaistatsaman testified force
 if jones were whisked away 6 but that on october 16 he had attempted to there can be no doubt
 that deane was find jerry potts the well known interpreter furious about cotton s mistake and guide in order to
 report the incident mistake is no word for it it was an to the police but was unable to locate
 him infamous breach of faith if i had any and therefore had returned to standoff as reason to suppose that
 john cotton s potts acted as interpreter for kaistatsaman word was not to be accepted at its face at the
 trial it seems reasonable to accept as value i never would have subjected a correct the indian s testimony that
 he could fellow creature to the persecution which notfin d potts on the 16 th 3 i knew he would
 have to endure if left the reason for supt cotton s failure to in the macleod neig hbourhood after his
 send jones out of town and beyond the reach work was done he ought to have been of the whisky
 sellers is a mystery cotton had g iven his half of the fines as soon as they been the adjutant
 for the force in the early were paid into court and he should 1880 s a position that deane held
 in 1884 have been sent back to regina without it is possible therefore that jealousy of any loss of time
 deane was part of the explanation for a few days after the receipt of the before cotton ‘ s failure
 to fulfil the agreement or perhaps cotton simply had lost his nerve in quoted letter a second one came to
 hand dated the 8 th november this was writconfronting liquor dealers that at least ten after sergt connon had reached
 maclend and was in part as follows i cannot find words to express my a serious ‘ barge gratitude to
 you for your kindness an indian recently confided to an intorpre to me and whatever happens i shall ter that
 bush had given him whiskey and bad never forget it sergeant connon arrived here last evening i have told also
 fired four shots at him the matter was him the whole facts of the case and he at once taken
 up and the indian who had i e does not think there will be much difturned to the blood reserve

 the same opinion and has promised to do all he can for me once laid before dr g a kennedy
 j p colonel maclend came by the coach charging bush with giving intoxicating liquor last evening and i think it
 was the to an indian and with shooting at the same intention to have the trial today but indian with
 intent to do grevious bodily harm something has prevented it so i sup bush is now in the guard room

 letter i received from the case was dismissed bush at maclend the continuation of in preparing to meet the third
 charge the proceedings is vividly described by of which from the first i felt assured sergeant connon whose report follows
 that jones was in very truth quite regina innocent i found that both super 24 nov 1884 intendent cotton and
 mr haultain it was 7 days before murray s were of opinion that on application capt rb deane being made
 the nature of the charge indian lodged the complaint superintendent and adjutant would be altered by colonel maclend n w

 so as to change it from being an indictable offence into one sent off at once not a thing in
 accordance with your instructions that could be tried summarily but i lefr regina on monday afrernoon colonel maclend would not
 move in the 3 rd instant and arrived at fort the matter and left the charge as would have taken
 place macleod on friday afternoon the was originally made and taken before 7 th instant it was a mistake keeping
 dr kennedy j p i immediately reported myself to supt hence the intervention of a jury me here cotton commanding
 that post and became necessary had a conversation with him as to the cases against constable jones i public opinion
 chiefly represented by learned that one mr haultain a the rowdy and lawless element at fort maclend was very much
 excited over barrister who had recently settled at the case and articles fort macleod had been retained for appearing from
 his defence i then saw jones time to time in the ivlacleod gazette the sole newspaper in that part of
 the above himself and spent the evening with him talking over the matter country violently and venomously kaistatsaman or found
 the gun on assailed the prisoner jones and the prairie gave evidence in thejoe i found that there were no

 indian however told a concocttrial appered in the maclend gazette another indication of public support for ed story and swore
 point blank that in 1884 those convicted was the sto ry fred pace told jones fired several shots at him
 and about harry stedman livery stable stuck to his story through a severe operator in fort macleod after pace s
 cross examination trial he hired stedman to take him back to standoff but when pace asked how much from the
 nature of the case there were he owed stedman said there was no no witnesses for the defence the charge
 for he was happy to help a bit to p risoner s mouth was closed colonel make up for pace
 s fine stedman later maclend charged the jury strongly became the mayor ofmacleod 2 against the prisoner the jury saw
 fit to believe the testimony of the indian it became evident that a fair trial at and found jones guilty
 but most the hands of a local july would be very illogically recommended him to mercy difficult if not impossible
 to obtain the evidence presented at the preliminary app lication was therefore made for a change of venue on the
 foregoing hearing and at the trial may have been grounds but colonel maclend peremp perjured but it was plausible and
 neither torily refused to grant the same judge mac cod nor the members of the jury had to anaesthetize themselves
 in order to on friday afternoon the 14 th instant find jones guilty indeed even when one the court was
 not able to get a jury learns that kaistatsaman s testimony was together the panel being quickly fals fied and
 that he shot the bullet through exhausted his own blanket many questions remain many of those summoned as jury about
 jones stor y men were notoriously biased against for example jones said that he was in a the prisoner as
 shown by their public hurry to get to mac cod but when his utterances and by the fact that they
 driver disappeared did he take off with the were subscribers to a fund that had wagon no not according to
 him he been got up to defray the expenses stated that he had got out oft he wagon in of
 the prosecution order to walk the fifteen miles to fort on saturday morning the 15 th macleod kaistatsaman stestimonyseemsa instant
 the court succeeded in little more p lausible he claimed that jones getting a jury but the prisoner had grabbed
 the reins and attempted to drive to exercise his right of peremptory off but in his drunken state was unable
 to challenge in no less than 5 cases and direct the team which went around in what was the strangest
 feature of circles until the pole broke at which point the case the learned counsel c c jones was forced
 to walk alberta history autumn 1992 jones certainly had been drinking a point istrate in the case william pocklington conf
 irmed in the testimony of harry who just happened to be the indian agent kamoose taylor who certainly ought for
 the blood reserve to have been able to recognize inebriation the charge against jones was for shooting since he was
 an old whisky trader and at kaistatsaman with intent to commit proprietor oft he mac cod hotel a place known
 far and wide for its revelries more grievous bodily harm but in giving instructions to the jury macleod stated that
 over jones admitted that he had given a the crown need not prove intent that if drink to kaistatsaman the
 jury members were persuaded that jones as for shooting at kaistatsaman jones had shot at kaistatsaman then this was bullets
 were gone and he acknowledged that adequate evidence of intent mac cod s he had fired his pistol although supposedly
 comments when passing sentence reveal why as a signal to some men passing by three he took the matter seriously
 and why he was miles away this story did not square with anxious to convict jones for the benefit of
 the information provided by constable cox the entire society according to the gazette at the trial cox testified that jones
 had he said that they must be very particular asked for more ammunition claiming that about such acts as the
 prisoner had been he had used his previous allotment shooting found guil ty of or the country would soon at
 jack rabbits and prairie chickens but be in aflame no man s life would be safe why would he have
 used all his ammu and the progress oft he country would be nition for either oft he stated purp oses
 when retarded he was surprised that a policehe was in a very sensitive and potentially man should act in that
 way he had had dangerous situation given that he was a the honor to command the force and this spy
 about to become an informer was the first time a policeman had ever finally why did jones not test at
 the fire d at an indian and it was owing to this that settlement had gone on so rapidly trial
 if there were secrets about police in the country he had told the prisoner operations that he did not want
 to divulge or there were contacts and associates to that he had struck the indian and killed him he would
 have been sentenced to be protect then his reluctance to take the st and would be understandable but as supt
 hanged no excuse of drunkenness would have averted it 2 cotton seemed to have betrayed him and italso appeared rather
 likely that he was colonel maclend sentenced the prisgoing to be sentenced to a long term in jail oner to
 twelve months hard labour at it is strange that he did not present his fort maclend but was subsequently alternate
 explanation haultain probably induced to alter the place of confinegave jones story in his summation but the ment to regina
 whither i escorted the lawyer s main effort was to crack the test i prisoner arriving here on the night
 of mony of the witnesses and so the judge the 21 st instant and jury really only had to decide
 whether c h connon one version was plausible or not sergt n w m p given these and other considerations
 one is left wondering if the conviction of jones aji this made very distressing reading for was substantiall y correct
 even if some of me and yet i felt that i had done everythe evidence and testimony against him thing
 possible to safeguard the interests was manufactured in fact the jury s of my emissary colonel macleod had verdict of
 guilty but wit h a recommenda been associated with the indians from tion for mercy indicates that its members the
 day the mounted police first entered were ambivalent about where truth lay in the country about ten years previously this
 instance what was a close call went and they looked upon him as a trustagainst the stranger to the community
 to worthy friend which he was he was a de g ree jones was made an object lesson invariably lenient
 when dealing with even b y judge maclead and his fellow mag them and hard as adamant with anyone who
 got them into trouble in their native shows either a faulty memor y or an attempt state the indian who
 had stolen or could to cover his tracks in an 1884 letter to steal for instance the greatest number edgar
 dewdney deane made the following of horses was looked upon as a hero to statement as to jones s ignorance
 oft he be eulogized and imitated and the teach indian act jones says he stated that he did ing of
 a long time of years could not not know it was more wrong to give liq uor obviously be eradicated
 in a single gener to an indian than to any other person and anon much less could they in that

 one room schools were moved in and connected into one large school this provided not only room enough for all

 the hoadley estate near bow city were combined to form the new school in 1918 this building was used until
 1952 when a new building was constructed t 5 this was similar to a large number of consoli dated schools
 in the area other old schools were used as teacherages and were placed beside the new consolidated schools or were
 sold to raise revenue as 1 ñ 0:n ‘ was done with the lone star school 4 schools were no longer
 within walking distance for many students and some children were bused first in horse drawn vans and later in motorized
 vehicles in the retlaw district farmers took turns driving the school vans as a means of pay ing their taxes
