 my father had made arrangements and who was married to one of mr parkwith the conductor on the line to
 let us hill s daughters since it was such a off at the crossing there was a different family affair
 it was not surprising that conductor on that night however and he the town was to be called parkhill refused
 to let us get off there unless we the company was to get sections 15 16 paid our fare all
 the way to stcively 17 and part of 9 and 21 for the townsite this my mother refused to do
 perhaps and in return they were to put up 40 000 she hadn t enough money left to do so
 worth of buildings within a specified and the conductor put us off at nanton time these conditions were not fulfilled
 it was dark when we arrived there as and when the time ran out the agreeit was a mixed train
 in those days and ment with the government fell through had stopped at every station to put off and the
 company had to relinquish most freight and there had been twenty five of the land keeping only section 16 the
 minutes at high river so that the train present townsite and 160 acres on the crew and any passengers who
 wished north side of section 9 later on when might stop for their supper when we amundsen and north bought

 him and trees that had never seen the prairie he and jimmie were so busy with last such as cedar
 laurel etc mr powell minute cleaning that they could see went east to sell the lots about 1904 the train
 approaching the crossing for but for some time the only buildings on the lights of it were plainly visible from
 the site were some hog pens opposite our farm a mile and a half away before where the station is
 now built by bailey they were ready so father sent jimmie powell for some hogs which he brought on ahead
 on his new saddle horse dixie down in 1903 and which caused the secto meet us while father got the
 team tion men to refer to the place as hog harnessed they were greatly disap town pointed when the train
 did not stop but soon realized what must have happened in the fall of 1904 mr will rothwell early next
