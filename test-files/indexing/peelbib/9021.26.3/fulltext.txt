 and ranching the winnipeg sun gives the particulars of an interview with mr i g baker of st louis the
 well known trader of the northwest at the leland house from it we gather that he is not favourably impressed
 with the prospects of civilizing the indians he says i am inclined to the belief after careful study of the
 character of the indian that it is a hard matter indeed to civilize a full bred one i have rarely
 known of any real progress being made in that direction except when they are taken as children as the united
 states government sometimes takes them and educates them almost from the cradle sometimes they are taken in batches of one
 and two hundred and educated by the government even after they are taught trades they will not work if they
 can return to their tribes and secure enough to eat of course there are exceptions to the rule i would
 not however despair altogether generations of patient labour may work a reform but it is a thankless tedious job do
 you not think the tribal relations which exist is a great drawback among them a very great drawback indeed for
 it serves to discourage anyone who may be industriously inclined if an indian attempts to secure food by cultivating land
 his brethern steal from him so that he is discouraged i have known indians to root the seed out of
 the ground after it was sown thus you see the indian has little incentive to work what he says in
 reference to the indian agents of the united states is equally applicable to those employed by our own government the
 government knows little of the matter however for every new indian agent appointed sends a glowing annual report to the
 department of indian affairs alluding especially to the deplorable condition in which he found the indians in his charge and
 the excellent progress they are making under his rule etc etc thus the department is deceived and the indians allowed

 arranged his not seem very much but when you conmatters with the govt also that col den sider that there
 was no road and that nis has sent you a map as i can tell you we had to make
 one over the prairie which all about my travels is very rough full of badger holes i left fort walsh
 on the 6 th for sound buffalo wallows we thought when we got ing lake with quite a party 18
 mounted to camping ground about 6 o clock that police a guide i had a seat on one of we
 had done a good days work it was the wagons but before we had been gone very monotonous driving all
 day long theme far i wished i had taken a horse to ride was nothing to catch eye just one
 vast as i found it very rough the driver did plain with no landmarks occasionally we his best to go
 into every hole over every would sight buffalo and antelope then stone he could the second day out the the
 whole party would go off hunt them guide a cree indian lost his way we they are however very shy
 it is diffihad to send a man back to the fort to cult to get within range of them we
 only get another who could speak english as got one antelope the whole trip the original one qould neither understand
 the fifth day out we came to the south us nor make himself understood this de branch of the saskatchewan
 river at the layed us half a day the new guide was junction of the red deer belly rivers a
 half breed quite a pleasant fellow it was a relief to the eyes to see the runcould speak fluently both
 english french ning water the banks lined with trees ve camped every night near water which but now came the
 difficulty of crossing it is sometimes very difficult to find on the we had brought with us two boats each
 plains it is generally quite salty and in three pieces which we placed in the scarcely fit to drink i
 slept in the same water side by side leaving a space of about tent with mr dickens a son of
 charles 4 feet between them then by placing a dickens who commanded the escort wagon box across their bows also
 over was very comfortable until about 3 30 in across the sterns a craft was made which the morning when
 we had to pack up would carry about 1800 lbs the river here be off we generally managed to travel
 for is about 300 yards wide with a current of about 3 miles an hour so it took some 20
 miles before dark the weather at last time to paddle the craft across we got got better the sky clear
 the guide everything over in 5 hours then we set said if we would allow him to go off for
 to work to get the horses to swim across a day he thought he could find the lake after a
 deal of shouting and throwing of off he went in 24 hours came back stones into the water to frighten
 them they said he had found the lake 25 miles from finally struck out into deep water in camp so
 we got in in the afternoon of the ten minutes or so were safely on the other next day we
 had provisions for a month side quicksands are very numerous in this so we were not much bothered on that
 river a great many horses cattle have score been sucked down by them at different at sounding lake we found
 1200 intimes dians waiting to be paid grumbling very about seven after supper mr dickens much at the non arrival
 of the money which i went across amid a swarm of mos was to come from battleford we had to
 quitoes the like of which i had never seen pacify them the best way we could tell before it was
 almost impossible to paddle them we expected the money to turn up our hands were so busy brushing them off
 every day making them presents of tea our faces every time i opened my mouth beef flour sugar tobacco they
 have i must have swallowed a dozen on the prodigious appetites one indian can other side they were worse off
 if possible manage 5 lbs of beef at a sitting with not waiting to take any of our traps we
 ease to my surprise mr dewdney turned ran through the bush to higher ground up three days after our arrival
 1 we paid started a smudge which kept a few of them the indians 5 a head man woman away
 it got quite dark in a couple of child according to treaty i came on with hours the men had
 all disappeared so him here battleford am staying with 1 had to either go myself down to the land the
 lt governor mr laird who was civil ing for my rugs or go without any sleep enough to ask me
 to come to his house i did not fancy going at all as there was although this is the capital
 of the northno road through the bushes the night was west it can scarcely be called a village dark as
 ink it would have been very for there are only the barracks a couple easy indeed to lose the way
 however of stores a few private houses the soset off in a short time returned with the ciety is small
 only the governor magistent my blankets trate registrar a couple of police of the next morning we found that the
 ficers flies had caused the horses to stampede love to all at home there was not one in slght so
 we were in yr aff son a pretty fix had to send men out in every e t gait direction
 to look for them who after a fruitless search of 4 or 5 hours returned to camp the guide however
 turned up in blackfoot crossing the evening with them having had to go oct 12 th 1879 15 miles off
 on the prairies to find them my dear papa we now thought we were in a fair way i have
 just got through a long pow wow of reaching sounding lake in three or four with the blackfeet indians as
 i shall days but as luck would have it the weather probably not be disturbed for an hour or became
 very thick foggy after travel two i shall give you an account of my doling a couple of days we
 became hope ings for the last six weeks lessly lost on the plains we kept on going i was at
 battleford for 3 weeks but for a week about 20 miles a day in the neither saw nor did very
 much as the inhope of striking a trail but with no sue dians had all gone south after the buffalo
 cess we would send the guide out at day gov laird was very kind we struck up break in the
 morning about 10 miles to quite a friendship our journey from there see if he could see any but he
 generally to cypress took 8 days was uneventful returned about noon with no news then save that mr dewdney killed
 a buffalo i we would start the wagons off do about had no chance to get one but no doubt
 i t i i a year after gait s trip lord lorne s party followed the same route across the
 prairies and killed a buffalo above is a sketch by sydney hall a member of the party shall capture one
 before long as i have a great deal take up much room water seen a good many on the plains
 we skin too is very scarce sometimes we have ned the animal took his hide which mea to go 40
 or 50 miles without a drop it is sured 9 feet he really looked massive while 170 miles to macleod
 took us 4 Â½ days lying on his side antelope are very num of steady travelling the road being none
 erous all over the country you have to of the best approach them very carefully as they are mr dewdney
 had previously engaged a very shy travelling with a lot of dogs house for me there thinking i could not
 as we do it is impossible to get nearer catch him so we took up our quarters in than 5
 or 600 yards ducks are very num it coi and mrs macleod were kind erous everywhere in the evening when
 enough to feed us at their house i should near water there are thousands of them in not care to
 live in the house as it seems the air geese too are very plentiful next to be infested by skunks
 the smell at year i must bring a geese sic up 1 night is intolerable the town as it is
 we only stayed a day at cypress called is not very extensive a couple of borrowed a team from the
 police to bring stores a barber shop the fort besides us on to fort macleod our horses being a few
 private houses comprise everything pretty well played out having been on the on arriving we heard that the biackfeet go
 since the end of july we travel with at this place were starving a few dying our four horse heavy
 team for our bag every day the most alarming rumors gage a light covered wagon drawn also were in circulation
 that they were killing by four horses for ourselves a cook cattle wholesale threatening the whites coachman complete our outfit
 we are corn with extermination fortunately the truth fortable enough on the plains sleeping in was grossly exaggerated although they
 a large bell tent altho we have some are in a pitiful state of want destitution times to use canned
 goods we are scarcely i scarcely think they will give us much ever reduced to nothing but dry bread trouble
 beyond the expense of funding bacon the horses suffer a great deal while them they are a miserable lot won
 t do travelling at this season of the year the anything for themselves i am afraid that prairies being burnt
 up scarcely any feed the farmers who are coming up to instruct left for them we could not get along
 at them will have to do nothing but feed them all if we did not carry oats which weigh there
 are 1200 of them altogether here we brought with us 22 head of cattle they generally have one or two
 snow storms 125 bags flour sugar tea so they in october followed by an indian sumwill be in clover for
 a few days but they mer it is very pleasant travelling now will have to be provided for during the
 there are of course no flies the nights are winter some way or other cold it has been precious cold
 getting before coming out here i visited the up early in the morning but now we have govt farm near
 calgary nearly lost a small stove which warms up the tent my life on the trip i had a smaller
 tent very nicely to myself about 5 oclock one morning this blackfoot crossing has always i woke up with my
 tent bedding every been a great place for indians a most thing else on fire outside the whole unattractive place
 it is the bow river is prairie was in flames i had my feet slightly quite large here it is
 fordable this year burnt my hair beard were singed but as a rule it is not but lost everything had
 to go into cal the blackfeet are not nearly so civilized gary without a hat or coat my nightcap as
 the crees it is only a few years since was burnt off my head the men were it was unsafe
 for a white man to go into sleeping in the wagon about 75 yards off their country while you find
 no end of did not wake up until i shouted to them half breeds among the crees i believe from
 the midst of the flames they could there are not more than half a dozen blacknot have put out the
 fire of the night be feet half breeds in the country in the event fore properly as a strong wind
 sprang up of trouble with the indians i believe the during the night must have blown some half breeds would
 throw in their lot with of the embers into the dry grass a few feet them i don t anticipate
 a row as the indistant it took us a couple of hours to put dians are very poorly armed are
 perout the fire i assure you i was quite fectly aware that if left to themselves must played out when
 we had got it under starve mr dewdney s management is i i only spent a day at calgary found
 think very judicious although the cost is it a very pleasant place i think i prefer going to be awful
 as the indians have to it to any place i have seen yet in the north be fed the expense
 of bringing in pro west the bow river running close to the visions is very heavy he is very patient
 fort is full of trout but as i lost my rod with them takes pains to have them by the
 fire i did not get any fishing it is understand clearly the present state of afabout the size of the
 magog this same fairs tells them that if they want to be style of river being very rapid the bow
 fed they must work the trouble at present river country is not what it has been is that there is
 nothing to put them at but cracked up to be its valley is very fertile in the spring the farms
 will be in full but limited in extent the fact is that this swing it remains to be seen how
 they part of the country is only good for cattle will do manual work grazing there are frosts nearly every
 the people about macleod who have month in the year which play the mischief cattle accuse the indians of killing
 a great with crops many but it is almost impossible to catch the govt has started a farm 9 miles
 them in the act near calgary where there from calgary on the bow river which is are some 2000 head
 only 12 are missing prettily situated the intention is to grow since the spring as much grain as possible to
 be ready for i expect we shall reach cypress about a grist mill to be set up next year flour
 the 25 th inst where father martin a deleis very expensive just now we paid to day gate of the
 american govt is waiting to 10 a bag for a large quantity accompany us on an important visit to the
 scenery between macleod cal sitting bull who is at present camped near gary is very fine the road skirts the
 rocky wood mountain i am looking forward to mountains almost all the way they are all this trip with much
 interest as i am told covered with snow look very imposing the sioux are very well armed i am after
 seeing nothing but prairie for some convinced that we have more to fear from time quite a lot of snow
 fell last night them than our own indians afterwards the ground has been quite white all day we shall return

 a portion for a coach i was glad to find that we of which we had to leave at the
 terminus were going to spend the night in a house as there was no room on the coach i gave
 as i was quite played out there was only the agent 10 he promised to send it one hotel that
 a little bit of a house forward as soon as possible sure en however we had to make the best
 of it ough it turned up a couple of days after mr norman t macleod i were we reached helena
 it was money well shown a room with 3 beds in it we turned spent as i found numbers of
 passengers at into one bed as the proprietor said the helena who had been waiting a week or others would
 be occupied by some other ten days for theirs which had not turned passengers after a little four men came
 up up commenced to prepare for going to we were very comfortable driving from bed one of them to my
 astonishment turn helena to benton 150 miles only one ed the key in the door put it in his other
 passenger in an open wagon as pocket this somewhat took me by sur the weather was fine we rather enjoyed
 prise i could not make it out at all so the trip than otherwise at benton we stay i made
 an excuse for leaving the room ed with the conrads for four days who went down stairs to find out

 from faction of those below in ottawa fort walsh being 15 days on the road the i leave for fort
 macleod the day after distance is about 500 miles it will seem tomorrow it is only 170 miles away but
 odd to you a journey of 500 miles in a i am afraid it will take 10 days at least
 wagon i was fortunate in having fine weaas i am told the snow is very deep for ther the whole
 way with the exception of about 50 miles of the way the police are the last day not that it
 did not rain for going to give me a very good team or it stormed about every night but the
 days outfit as they call it in this country i were sun shiney not too hot in this have no
 doubt i shall get through in time country it rains as a rule throughout june somehow or other we shall
 start with the july after which it is sure to be fine the wagon on runners the wheels inside prairies
 then become very dry all the small travel thus as far as the snow lasts mr lakes mud holes are
 dried up travel cecil denny a police officer is going ling sometimes becomes difficult on acwith me so i shall
 have some company count of the scarcity of water last autumn he is a very nice fellow i should not
 be i had to travel on one occasion 72 miles surprised if he went with me as far north without
 being able to give the horses a as fort calgary drink which is more trying to them than i trust
 you are all safe sound in eng many miles of travel land by this time that you will be i
 have been getting up very early on the comfortably settled in your new home by road this spring i am
 called at 3 30 the time this reaches you the horses are generally ready to start by 5 i am
 afraid i have been too long wind then we travel for s hours rest for 3 ed but it will
 be a couple of weeks before hours have lunch then go on until i can write again 5 or 6
 in the evening have supper turn into bed at 7 30 i did not like the early love to papa
 family rising at first found that i was intoler yr aff son ably sleepy the whole morning but after e
 t gait a few days i got quite used to it it is necessary to make an early start when
 you shoal lake have a long trip before you on account of 6 th july 1880 the horses who find
 it much easier to travel my dear mamma in the cool of the morning than in the heat you will
 see from the above if you look of the day at the map that i am now at the eastern
 my wagons broke down several times extremity of the north west territories i i had much difficult y in patching

 a tiny settlement of homes and stores above is a sketch made by dr r b nevitt in the late
 1870 s them up sufficiently to bring me through reduced since last year i have travelled a i was not
 without company on the trip great many miles this spring have scarceas i had an officer 26 men of the
 mount ty seen any game at all ed police with me for some 330 miles this shoal lake is the
 headquarters they were going to build a new fort at of the indian department and i trust i qu appelle
 i met plenty of half breeds shall not have to spend much of my time going south to hunt buffalo
 but only one here as it is a little bit of a place with camp of indians i am glad
 i did not see no inhabitants but half a dozen policemen many of the latter as they are very poor
 a storekeeper the main road to the almost entirely destitute in conse west passes by our office we see strange
 quence great beggars i had a long talk faces nearly every day either emigrants gowith the chiefs in the camp
 we met they ing to their new homes or govt officials recounted all their grievances ills going to different parts
 of the country wound up bringing all their little children our buildings are prettily situated about to me to show
 how thin they were alto 50 yards from shoal lake the lake is gether it was most disagreeable to me
 as somewhat narrow but 6 miles long what i had no food to give them i dislike about this part
 of the country is these indians have only themselves to the lowness of the land the consequence thank for being
 so poor hungry as if being that we have nothing but swamps they would do as the government wants all
 round us the roads in this neighbourthem to they would work on their reser hood are very bad you can
 t even go out vations receive a regular ration of beef for a short walk without coming to a marsh
 and flour but the trouble is they do not which makes one turn back travelling in like the idea of
 settling down to work on wagons too is very monotonous as your their farms prefer to roam over the horses
 are sure to get stuck in the mud prairies with their women children in several times everyday which involves search
 of game the latter has become very every one standing in water mud up the scarce there being next to
 no buffalo middle digging both horses wagons the number of antelopes seem to be much out the best way you
 can the mosquitoes the new nwmp barracks were constructed at fort qu appelle at the time of gait s travels
 in the area above is a view of them in 1885 are not nearly so had as they were last
 shoal lake year although i have seen quite sufficient 22 july 1880 to give me much annoyance at times how
 my dear father ever at night i am all right under my mos since writing you on the 8 th
 inst mr quito curtain dewdney has been here stayed but one the country between here winnipeg day then left in
 a great hurry for edis settling up fast notwithstanding the mud monton as the agent there is incurring there are
 stopping places now every 25 large liabilities on the part of the govt miles along the road and things generally
 in that section are not working as well as could be desired the mail communication is very poor mr dewdney
 expressed himself as be we only get our letters papers every three weeks no telegraph also as the line ing
 much pleased with my work in the passes us some 75 miles north this will western country and has left
 me behind be changed in a year as the railway is be to act for him in the country east
 of battleing pushed forward rapidly by the fall ford i did not speak to him about the assistant commissionership as
 he was about 50 miles will be completed west of winnipeg leaving us only 130 miles to worried about various
 matters and i have travel by wagon the country all around had to decide to let the matter rest until
 here is deluged with surveyors working in the summer s work is over i don t see how connection with
 the r r they can fail to do some thing for me before long as they give me free swing
 in the hudson s bay co have stores all indian matters generally and all indian over this part of the
 country but it affords people in the territories are subject to my one little satisfaction to deal with them as
 orders who nevertheless nearly all draw they charge most exorbitantly for every larger salaries than myself however i am thing
 the only thing i get from them is laying myself out to do my work as well a bottle of
 cross blackwells pickles as possible and by the end of the summer every now and again which go very well
 i think my exertions will show a good rewith pork or bacon beef being very scarce suit this is rather
 self glorification but in fact it is impossible to get it at times i am not ashamed of it i
 am perfectly satisfied if i get it once i see by the papers that sir john 7 or twice a
 week sir charles tupper are likely to go to eng my friends in montreal write me very land shortly in
 connection with the canaregularly keep me pretty well posted dian pacific i trust you will be able to do not
 forget that my address now is dispose of it to english capitalists as it care of indian office winnipeg manitoba
 will relieve the country of a burden which wherever i may be my letters will be it is scarcely able
 to carry the expense forwarded i have enjoyed yours papa s the country is put to by having to send
 out letters very much i am so glad that you these large parties of surveyors who seem are getting on
 nicely in london johnnie to get along with their work very slowly writes occasionally hut is not a very good
 is simply enormous correspondent i niet marcus smith who i believe is i have not seen mr dewdney since my
 next to mr schreiber on the way from return but i expect he will turn up from ellice the day
 before yesterday he had winnipeg in a day or two i am anxiously been two months coming from winnipeg awaiting
 him as i am quite in the dark as visiting the different r r parties on the to what my
 movements this summer will way he says that 100 miles of road west be i suppose i shall have to
 do a great of winnipeg will be completed by the deal more travelling but i prefer it to re autumn
 the second hundred miles will maining in an out of the way place jike bring the road about 10 miles
 west of this this place passing 6 miles north of it then it yr aff son is proposed to take
 it about 80 miles due north on the east side of the assiniboine e t gait river crossing it about
 20 miles south of pelly i went up to pelly last week and i don t believe it will be
 possible to build the road in that direction the country between shoal lake and pelly being one continuous succession of
 muskegs marshes and swamps i can assure you that even i travelling in a light buck board got stuck in
 swamps over and over again and the surveyors working in that section admit that it is almost impracticable to take
 the road through what surprises me is that there should be any uncertainty about taking the r r through the
 good portion of the country which is fast settling up the soil and land generally is quite a 1 all
 along the assiniboine river to fort ellice where the qu appelle valley opens up thence a short distance along the
 latter and then up to touchwood hills would be altogether the best route if it is the intention of the
 govt to defray the expense of this undertaking by the sale of r r lands with the exception of duck
 mountain about 20 miles north the whole country north of shoal lake is too swampy to be ever good for
 much especially when settlers can find higher land and better soil by going towards the assiniboine river the hon edgar
 dewdney lieutenant governor of the north west territories was galt s superior in which money might be made about here
 or rather so or 60 miles nearer winnipeg but mainly in small undertakings which would undoubtedly pay well but would
 not increase very materially in value there is plenty of room business for saw grist mills at different points water
 power being available almost every 20 miles along the trail to winnipeg timber is not very plentiful it is principally
 poplar i think in a few years will be used up land undoubtedly is a good purchase in the neighbourhood
 of the small thriving villages such as rapid city on the little saskatchewan river i know of a considerable tract
 of very fine land on the south side of the assiniboine river about 80 miles west of portage la prairie
 at a place they call the rapids which has not yet been taken up i trust that you will come
 out this summer that i may see you i shall be within reach of the telegraph from this time on
 i trust if you come up in this direction you may be able to arrange in ottawa to have me
 meet you and go about with you my letters should be addressed to care i start next week to visit
 all the agencies and indians between this place and battleford and expect to be away about ten weeks as i
 shall have to go over a great deal of ground i have already travelled 2700 miles in a wagon and
 am not a little tired of getting up at 3 in the morning i find it is much easier for
 the horses to travel in the cool of the morning and rest during the heat of the sun the mosquitoes
 are very troublesome this summer i could not sleep at all at night were it not for my mosquito veil
 which covers the whole of my bed this shoal lake is a very quiet place with scarcely any inhabitants but
 mr dewdney has a very comfortable house in which i have made myself at home i am told the duck
 shooting about here is marvellous i shall probably have some good sport in october from what mr dewdney told me
 i think we shall certainly spend a portion of the winter in ottawa i am exceedingly desirous of doing so
 as i wish to get the steamboat undertaking under way i think there is more money in it than in
 anything else although i see many ways f if graham indian office winnipeg 9 in the fall of 1879 sir

 types and for years past reports have been spread from time to time regarding the presence of asphalt and petroleum
 tar in the country surrounding edmonton and a good deal of time and money has been expended in the hitherto
 vain effort to locate the actual springs indian stories were told of springs of black mud here and there but
 none of these stories could ever be traced up to actual fact the indian who knew the place was dead
 or the one who had heard of it was unable to find it or the spring having been found was
 only black mud and not the wished for petroleum color was lent to these reports by the known facts regarding
 the vast petroleum deposits on the athabasca which might easily extend to underlie the edmonton district by the fact that
 limestone boulders saturated with petroleum tar in a hard dry state were frequently found on the river bars and by
 the further facts that in the valley of a creek about 60 miles south west of edmonton large boulders or
 broken pieces of sandstone saturated with tar were found and a similar find was made at pigeon lake the weak
 point of these discoveries was that although beyond question the tar was there being only in loose moveable pieces of
 stone no clue was given as to the locality of the spring from which it came a local company was
 formed to bore for oil at the creek mentioned but the drill procured was unsuited for the purpose and soon
 broke and the boring was abandoned this was the last attempt that was made to find oil until monday of
 this week rumors had been gathering ever since spring opened as to the existence of a most peculiar spring north
 of st albert and on monday last p daly drove out to the place about 22 miles distant to investigate
 on his return lie brought with him a number of pieces of earth or mud saturated with tar so as
 to be quite flexible and a pan full of the tar itself in a semi liquid state taken out of
 a hole which he caused to be dug to a depth of about five feet apparently the tar had exuded
 through a crack in the ground saturating the surface earth and being itself hardened by the process about two feet
 below the surface the first pure liquid tar was found in what appeared like pockets as far as the digging
 was carried the color of the tar is black with a very slight brownish tinge it is of the consistency
 and has very much of the smell of ordinary coal tar in every way it exactly resembles the tar found
 on the athabasca which has been pronounced by geologists to be the product of petroleum beds the tar burns readily
 in a fire giving off smoke and a smell exactly like petroleum whether or not the tar is a sure
 indication of a profitable petroleum field there is no doubt of the genuineness of the find and as little that
 it is not confined to that single locality edmonton bulletin june 16 i 892 a second portrait of maskipiton by
