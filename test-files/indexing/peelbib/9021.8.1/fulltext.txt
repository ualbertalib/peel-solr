 alberta my life in the north west mounted police by col james walker the reasons for the organization of the
 north west mounted police were to put a stop to the illegal trading of whiskey and the infamous massacres murders
 indian wars etc that were taking place in the great lone land taken over from the hudson s bay company
 by the canadian government this state of frightfulness had been reported to the dominion government by missionaries and others and
 in 1870 captain butler was sent west by the government to report on conditions in 1871 he reported a country
 without law order or security robbery and murder have gone unpunished for years indian massacres are unchecked and civil and
 legal institutions are unknown he recommended the establishment of constitutional authority with sufficient force to back it up in 1872
 colonel robertson ross was sent west to make a further report he reported similar conditions and urgently recommended a force
 such as captain butler had suggested be organized and sent west however no action was taken by the government until
 june 1873 when an act was passed authorizing the dominion government to establish the n w m p in september
 of that year about one hundred and fifty officers and men were recruited and sent to winnipeg over the dawson
 route lt colonel g a french a british army artillery officer and commandant of a battery royal school of gunnery
 kingston was given command of the n w m p and joined the troops in manitoba in november of that
 year it had been the intention to restrict no person shall be appointed to this force to one hundred and
 fifty of all the police force unless he be of ranks but from the information given to sound constitution able
 to ride lt colonel french of the difficulties to active and able bodied and bebe overcome by hudson s bay
 and other tween ages of 18 and 45 years nor officials in winnipeg he decided that the unless he is
 able to read and write force should be largely increased and the english or french language he returned to ottawa
 and received it was found later that there was difauthority to increase the force to six ficulty when a man
 knew only the divisions of fifty men each with full french language the officer appointed compliment of officers and staff
 it was quartermaster of the force had been a not until march 1874 that colonel french school teacher in quebec

 camping out was the months of april and may i was new to most of us and the prairie cooks
 posted to d troop as a sub inspector had to be educated our transport under inspector walsh this was the
 wagons were all in the knock down and staff troop and i often wondered the harness and saddles were so
 many whether i belonged to the staff or the boxes of straps all these had to be put troop as
 i was most of my time with together before we could make a start colonel french he took me with
 him for the canadian boundary when this recruiting and when we purchased sup was done and our eighty wagons loaded
 plies these supplies consisted of boots the fun began most of our horses had and shoes shirts underclothing gaunt been
 bought for their good looks some lets gloves socks etc also hardware of them objected to having the harness including
 axes shovels pails cups on others refused to draw the wagons saucers plates cutlery etc these were others would start
 kicking and some purchased in toronto i also had a gen fiery teams with inexperienced drivers eral supervision of the
 horses while en would start across the prairie with route from toronto to dufferin loaded wagons and would have to
 be on june 6 th 1874 we embarked on rounded up by men on horseback this two special trains at
 toronto permis circus was on every morning during the one hundred and sixty miles march to going past and put
 my saddle on it and fort dufferin on arrival at fort dufferin went with them into the storm the night
 on june 19 th we were met by the officers was pitch dark except during the flashes and men who
 had gone west in 1873 and of lightning fortunately there were no we spent about two weeks or more rear
 wire fences in those days the horses ganizing the troops and arranging the took the trail back over the boundary
 transport line that we had just come over and i one incident that happened during followed their tracks by the
 lightning our stay at dufferin that will live in the flashes until daylight when i got to memory of all
 members of the force of the pembina river the round poles that that time was the stampede of our horses
 covered the bridge had got shifted and not the tame kind of a stampede we some of the horses had
 fallen through are accustomed to see nowadays but it took me some time in the dark to repair three hundred
 horses going perfectly the bridge and get my horse over after wild breaking their fastenings when daylight dawned i began
 to find stray tied up to the wagons during a terrific horses feeding along the road and to thunder storm
 of rain and hail in the make sure that i had got ahead of all the middle of the night
 our camp was ar horses i rode into grand forks some ranged in a hollow square the wagons sixty miles
 from our camp i then turned lined up on three sides and the tents and started driving the horses back
 to on the fourth the horses were tied to camp and later was met by a sergeant the wagons inside
 the square our and a party who had left camp at daywagons had canvas coverings the wind light to assist
 me we arrived back at tore these loose and they struck the camp with the horses about 11 o clock
 heads of the horses putting them wild that night just twenty four hours after and sending them through the tents
 like they had left during that time i had a cyclone quite a number of the men caught up and
 ridden five different horses were injured and tents knocked down and had been wet through and dried out i had
 not undressed when this happened three different times i had ridden one and ran out of the tent to see
 what the hundred and twenty miles by trail trouble was i was able to catch a horse besides many extra
 miles rounding up c ‘ 1 4 c iv wl l ‘ a thunderstorm at night caused a violent horse
 stampede in the mounted police camp an on the spot sketch of the exciting incident was made by artist henri
 lulien horses by the way the horses did not ported that these indians had crossed get over their fright all
 that summer and the boundary coming towards dufferin had to be watched closely as an unusual colonel french ordered all
 available noise would stampede them men to parade mounted and armed and about two or three days after we had
 we marched west to intercept the inrecovered our horses after the stampede dians after being out about eight hours at
 dufferin colonel french showed me and finding no signs of indians we rea telegram he had received from grand turned
 to camp forks saying that two of our horses we marched out of dufferin on july had been captured there
 and would be 8 th for some time after leaving dufferin held until sent for we were still short a
 mowing machine and rake was sent two horses but i had decided that they with the advance guard and when
 the had been drowned or killed when they night camp was selected grass was cut fell through the pembina river
 bridge and fed to the horses that were tied up i left for grand forks at once and on to
 the wagon later when the horses arrival there i found a team of very fine were used to the prairies
 they were horses with the broad arrow brand on turned loose and night herded our horses were all branded mp
 these each troop was to take turns to supply horses had got away from the boundary horses for the mowing
 machine and survey camp at wood mountain about rake the team supplied for the mowing two weeks before and had
 gone across country to grand forks over four hun machine for the second night camp took dred miles i commandeered
 them for fright at the noise of the machinery in motion and ran away with the machine my troop and
 they made the round trip of 1874 back to duff erin circusing through the camp without a driver the men
 were pitching tents while at dufferin colonel french cooking etc and there was a general engaged as additional transport about
 scramble for the covered wagons colone hundred red river carts with oxen onel french sent for the o c who
 had and half breed drivers also half breed furnished this runaway team and after guides a short argument between them
 this o c colonel french decided to take beef went back to dufferin major walsh was cattle along for rations
 also breeding transferred to the command of his troop stock to be distributed to the posts to be and i
 was given command of d troop established later before leaving duf i retained command of this troop until ferin an
 american cattle dealer came june 1876 when i was given command into camp and stated he had a herd of
 of e troop on being transferred from about one hundred work oxen and mixed headquarters to battleford cattle for sale
 south of the line i was instructed to go down and buy them if our greatest hardship on the march
 i thought they were worth the money was scarcity of good water sometimes which i did and later on in
 the march we were twenty four hours without the work oxen in this herd took the place water of any
 kind most of the time we of played out transport horses and the had to use slough water that had
 to be beef cattle were killed as required strained and boiled before it was drinkable and when we got into
 the buffalo our destination was to be the cypress country these sloughs were still further hills and fort whoop up
 some place in polluted by the buffalo tramping and the far west there was a good trail feeding through them
 another hardship along the boundary line but we were in was scarcity of fuel we laid in a stock structed
 to keep about forty miles north of wood when near a wooded country of the boundary so as not to
 get into any but when we got west of old wives mix up with the american indians as lakes we
 had to depend almost entirely they were constantly on the war path on buffalo chips these made a good fire
 in those days when dry but were impossible when wet while we were in camp at dufferin we were travelling
 over trackless unthe american sioux indians raided the habited country more or less by compass village of st jo about
 thirty miles west and checked our locality occasionally by on the boundary line and massacred a observations for latitude and
 had also family named morrow and it was re to check the variation of the compass we left dufferin with
 a variation of 16 crossed a small creek where we estaband at our furthest west point the van lished the
 cripple camp and on followation was 23 ing this stream down i found it emptied i was given command of
 d troop into a small stream which connected the shortly after leaving dufferin and col two lakes onel french and
 staff was attached to inspector jarvis with his troop left us my troop in addition to looking after the at
 roche percee on 26 th july to go to troop colonel french knowing i had edmonton via fort ellice and
 carleton taken a course in military sketching and the first halt of any length was at old road surveying at
 the school of gunnery wives creek where we arrived on 10 th under him detailed me to make a sketch
 august most of our horses were getting of our line of march i measured the thin and needed rest also
 some of our distance with an odometer on one of the men were sick or had met with accidents wagon
 wheels and took the bearings and it was decided to establish what we with a prismatic compass and plotted called
 cripple camp at this point sereach day s travel on a map this work i geant sutherland was left in
 charge of carried out during the whole of our trip the men and horses that were unable to to the
 west and return go any further during the time we were the only map of the territories in at this
 camp i was absent some days those days was one almost blank making a sketch of the lakes and country
 made by hector and palliser it showed in that district and met a half breed the points that they had
 visited correctly trader named morrow who had his outbut most of the map had been filled in fit some distance
 from woody mountain from information that was received from he said he had some ponies he could sell traders and
 half breeds and others and and colonel french sent me to buy these was unreliable one instance of the un
 horses i bought twenty of them and they reliability of the hector and palliser map came in useful as saddle
 horses as many was found at old wives lakes the map of our saddle horses had been put to showed
 a small stream running into the work on the wagons as this trader was south end of the lake and
 we were hop going into winnipeg shortly i gave him ing when we reached this that we would a letter
 to mail home extracts of this get good water as we were all getting were published afterwards in the eastern
 very tired of the alkali and slough water on arriving at the south end of the lake hay for the
 mounted police horses and oxen no stream was to be found but after during their western trek was cut by
 advance parties each day these were among the first going about thirty miles further west we mowers to be introduced
 to western canada papers and was the only news that had of the cypress hills on 5 th septembeen heard
 from the force for about two ber we were on the banks of the sasmonths katchewan near where medicine hat
 the boundary survey party were fin now is we then followed up the south ishing their work that fall and
 had a side of the saskatchewan to the forks stock of oats and provisions at white of the bow and
 belly rivers where we mud depot which they did not require arrived on 11 th september we expected and on
 21 st august colonel macleod to find one of the outlaw whiskey trad assistant commissioner and myself went ing forts
 there but found only some there with about forty red river carts empty log buildings the intention had and loaded
 with rations and oats in been to send major walsh and his troop addition to half breed drivers we had
 from this point to edmonton but after a mounted policeman for each cart in sending out scouting parties to look
 for case of attack by american indians a suitable crossing of the river it was decided on the 14 th
 that all the troops i was detailed on this trip to check up would go south to the west butte
 on the my survey at some point on the bound boundary line where we arrived on 2 lst ary line
 while we were on this trip september and camped at milk river colonel french s force continued the the weather
 was getting cold and frosty march west it was arranged that and the horses were dying for want of colonel
 macleod should take a north grass every morning we were leaving west course and overtake him after we dead or
 dying horses behind in camp had received our supplies which we did one cold snowy morning we left thirty on
 31 st august we joined the main body i never saw pasture fields with less grass again near the point
 where the c p r than there was on the prairies the last later crossed swift current creek we one
 hundred miles we had travelled were now in the buffalo country though most of us had to quit riding and
 the we did not see many of them the closer horses were turned into the herd or we got to
 the herd of buffalo the less transport wagons two private horses of grass we found our trail took us north
 mine were used for gun horses i may say here that all the officers up the first rocket there was
 a most diswere allowed to buy their saddle horses mal howl from hundreds of timber on repayment at cost price
 wolves from all directions some close we had been travelling through herds to camp and others miles away they of
 buffalo for three weeks once or twice were very destructive to the buffalo i we turned the rear end of
 our transport was riding out west of cypress hills one wagons towards a herd of stampeding day looking for water
 and came across buffalo when they were stampeding a band of eight or ten large timber across our trail we
 had no scarcity of wolves eating a half grown buffalo they fresh meat antelope were also plenti had just killed
 i rode close to them and ful our ration of flour was reduced to they showed fight and made as
 if they 14 ozs our only vegetable was dried would attack my horse i decided i had sliced potato which
 when cooked was not lost any wolves that day and left tasteless and very tough them to finish their dinner
 colonel french and i rode on to the while we were in camp on milk river west butte of the
 sweetgrass hills this colonel french and colonel macleod rises about eight hundred feet above the went to fort benton montana
 and conprairies from where we stood we could tracted for a quantity of oats and prosee about forty or fifty
 miles over the visions to be sent to our camp after we prairies and in every direction were received these
 supplies the force separlarge herds of buffalo feeding and mov ated colonel french and staff my troop ing about i
 asked colonel french to also inspector carvell s troop started on estimate the number of buffalo in sight the return
 trip to swan river barracks after looking around for some time he near fort pelly on 30 th september and
 said there were a million or more and assistant commissioner macleod was to i agreed with him take the balance
 of the force three we were surprised at not meeting any troops and establish posts in the west at indians
 when we got into the indian points to be selected our return march country but we were not unseen by
 them was uneventful we called at old wives when colonel french went into fort creek on 10 th october and
 picked up benton the people knew all about us the men and horses we had left at the american and
 blackfeet indians had cripple camp prairie fires were burnreported our progress from time to time ing over large portions of
 the country and said the red coats were like ants the only feed was green and frozen and were running
 all over their country grass around the small lakes the oats they gave us credit for being very brave we
 received from fort benton saved the almost every day some of our hunters situation and we received a fresh supply
 after getting ci general direction to the of oats at swan river barracks about next camp would go out to
 the right or the 21 st october most of us were walkleft of the line of march and would often
 ing when we reached this fort as the come into camp later with an antelope horses were required for transport
 puron their shoulders on one occasion one poses or were being herded along quarof our officers found an indian pony
 ters had been built for us there that picketed and brought it into camp that summer by the dominion board
 of works same night this officer s horse was taken but there were not sufficient supplies or from camp showing
 that he had been quarters for two troops watched by the indian when colonel colonel french then decided that the
 french heard of the incident he gave this staff and my troop would go back to officer a lecture and
 ordered him to take fort dufferin and winter there we the indian pony back to where he found started on
 30 th october and had winter it on one of two occasions our hunters weather most of the way and
 arrived in did not reach camp before nightfall and dufferin about the middle of november colonel french had anticipated such
 an having made one of the longest trips on event and had taken along a supply of record over an
 almost unknown country rockets these were sent up at intervals by an expedition carrying its own supduring the night and
 guided the last men plies colonel french and staff remained into camp timber wolves were very in winnipeg we were
 travelling for four plentiful after we reached the buffalo months and never saw habitation except country i remember the night
 we sent a few hudson s bay trading posts until we reached red river valley a fair esti these well
 into the night they well demate of the white settlers west of winni served the small item of praise that
 was peg in 1874 would not be over one hun given them by colonel french who was dred and they
 were mostly settled not given to blarney in his report of around portage la prairie that expedition colonel french says
 in fort dufferin was about five miles his report from fort pembina north dakota where tied by no stringent rules
 of an american infantry regiment was sta articles of war but only by the tioned under the command of colonel
 silken cord of a civil contract these wheaton and he and his officers made men by their conduct gave little
 our stay at fort dufferin that winter cause for complaint day after day very pleasant my officers then were on
 the march night after night on inspector john french afterwards killed picquet or guard and working at in the riel

 l poett delighted when occasionally a pure we were a healthy but ragged lot spring was met with there was
 on arriving at fort dufferin i had worn still no complaint when salt water the soles off two pairs of
 boots and had or the refuse of a mud hole was the worn out a dozen pairs of moccasins only
 liquid available and i have besides damage to other parts of the seen this whole force obliged to uniform drink
 liquid which when passed too much cannot be said of the pluck through a filter was still the colour perseverance
 and endurance of the of ink three hundred riders of the plains dur the fact of horses and oxen failing
 the 1874 march almost every officer ing and dying for want of food and man acted as if the success
 of our never disheartened or stopped expedition was his duty when his horse them but pushing on on foot with
 was too weak to carry him or was re dogged determination they carried quired to replace played out or dying
 through the service required of horses on the transport he was ready them under difficulties which can to give up
 his horse and walk i well only be appreciated by those who remember one night in september when witnessed them
 the broad fact is we had a bad snow storm and it was apparent that a canadian force very cold
 officers and men were out hastily raised armed and equipped most of the night with their horses and and not
 under martial law in a few put part of their own blankets on the months marched vast distances horses which
 were packed as close as through a country for the most part possible to secure some shelter behind as unknown
 as it proved bare of the covered wagons that morning we pasture and scanty in the supply left thirty dead
 or dying horses in camp of water of such a march under all the men many of them unaccus such
 adverse circumstances all tomed to such hardships and notwith true canadians may well be standing the extra work scanty rations
 proud and the prospect of attack from indians or outlaws and being set afoot by an shortly after our arrival
 at fort dufearly winter in an unknown hostile coun ferin i was ordered to take over the try acted splendidly
 in my own troop buildings and all the supplies equip i had a cheerful faithful lot of workers ment and
 transport of the british boundand often after some of our most discour ary survey as their work had been cornaging
 days and perhaps a scanty supper pleted this transport consisted of some from a fireless tent some person would forty
 teams of horses and sixty yoke of start some old song such as tenting oxen with their harness wagons and
 tonight or it might be a genial irish also provisions so i had a busy winter sergeant i had would
 start killarney s ranging this country for hay to feed this lakes and you would hear old songs like stock
 in addition to my m p horses in the early spring of 1875 a number ing our mail between winnipeg
 and of my troopers decided that they had headquarters the summer of that year had enough of mounted police service
 general sir selby smyth made a trip and crossed over to the land of the free through the territories and
 i met him one night sergeant knight in charge of with an escort and transport at shoal the stable picquet
 reported to me that lake manitoba and sent him west by a horse was missing from the stable and fort
 carlton sergeant john herron a constable was also missing i told him afterwards m p of pincher creek went to
 put my saddle on kangaroo a race in charge of the escort i went east in the horse we had
 and i would go after him spring of 1876 and left fort pelly with there were two roads to the
 boundary one man and two ponies in flat sled one the best track was on the ice on and was
 two days making about 12 the red river and the other the short miles the snow was so deep in
 places est overland and drifted i took the that we were continually shovelling the latter road and made good time
 until horses out and making roads for them the two roads joined on the ice about to get through the
 snow at the end of half way to the border seeing nothing the second day our mail carrier came i
 turned kangaroo on to the river road along he had six dogs drawing his sled and was not long in
 overtaking my man i decided then to send my ponies back i rode alongside and ordered him to halt and
 i took three of his dogs for my sled but he kept on going i then reached my party then
 consisted of myself and over and caught him by the coat collar two half breeds one went ahead of the
 and pulled him off his horse and jumped sleds on snowshoes and the other and on him on the ice
 both horses were myself drove the two dog teams as we pretty well blown and did not try to had
 heavy loads we had little opporleave i searched my prisoner and put tunity of riding it was a case of
 running him on his horse tied his feet in the stir behind the sled with the chance of standrups and
 gave him a lively ride back to ing on behind going down hill it was barracks a few days after
 i took him to very tiresome for the first day as the winnipeg where he was tried before a pace
 was too fast for a walk and too judge and given six months for horse slow for a run it
 was just a sort of a stealing dog trot i unfortunately cut my leg in the spring of 1875 the
 staff and my over the shin bone when chopping down troop moved to swan river barracks we a dry tree
 the first night in camp i arrived there in july on the way up i bandaged it up as best
 i could and alhad established several detachments though it pained considerably to follow along the route for the purpose of
 carry the dogs i was able to keep up and the t ‘ a ‘ s s ‘ s r

 the village i was told this ing the indian chief and warriors the family had the same dirty face trouble
 chief shook hands with the lieutenant every winter and i contrary to the doc governor and welcomed him to the
 coun tor s opinion reported to governor laird try and no attempt was made to stop that the case was
 not smallpox i did the commissioners we then went to not quarantine the district and there was no outbreak of
 smallpox some years later there was a real case of smallpox at prince albert which i immediately quarantined and there
 were no further cases reported when i was making the treaty payments in 1877 the duck lake indians claimed they
 had made a separate treaty and were promised better terms than the other cree indians i tried to convince them
 that they had not done so and gave them just what was promised by the treaty but they were not
 satisfied next year when i was leaving battleford to make the treaty payments lt governor laird superintendent of indian affairs
 thinking that he could convince the indians that they were getting all they were entitled to went with me to
 duck lake we were received by the chief and indians in a large council tent after governor laird explained the
 treaty to them one of the head men told him they did not believe him the lieutenant governor lost his
 temper and left the council tent saying i will not listen to such talk some of the indians got between
 him and the tent opening and i shoved them aside and the lieutenant governor left for carlton where he was
 staying i then told the indians that they had insulted the queen s representative and should be punished but i
 was still ready to give them everything the treaty they had signed promised a few cf the old people came
 and received the treaty money but the chief and his head men and most of his followers refused i told
 them they would receive no further rations i had arranged to make the payments in prince albert next day and
 would pay them when they informed me they were willing to take what the treaty promised them i issued a
 very liberal supply of ration and presents to those who had taken the treaty money but gave nothing to the
 others and returned to carlton where i was staying that night i was called out of bed about midnight as
 governor laird wanted to see me on going into his room he handed me a letter he had received from
 mr hughes stobart s agent at duck lake stating that the indians after i had left had gone into his
 store and demanded the indian supplies and were going to take them he had then persuaded them to wait until
 morning and he would write a letter for col james walker them to lt governor laird this letter was to
 the effect that if the indian supplies were not given to them by sunrise next morning they were going to
 take them i told the lt governor not to lose any sleep over the letter as i would be back
 in duck lake before sunrise and i was satisfied that i could settle the matter i only had a sergeant
 and two troopers with me and warned them to be ready at daybreak to proceed to duck lake in the
 morning we arrived at mr hughes store at duck lake in good time and found mr hughes and his staff
 up expecting trouble we had not long to wait as the indians had started from their camp about a mile
 away half naked and all togged up in war paint about one hundred of them armed and mounted they came
 up the road singing war songs riding around in circles and lying on the sides of their horses shooting under
 the horses necks the stores were inside of the stockade and mr hughes wanted to shut the gates but i
 asked him not to as i wanted all the indians inside when they were all inside the stockade i surprised
 them by coming out of the office with my three men fully armed with revolvers and river if there was
 trouble i had frequent rifles i posted these men on three sides interviews with these indians and told of the
 store where the indian supplies them that they were refugees here and were and took the indian interpreter would have
 to keep the peace and work with me to the chief beardy and told him for a living as our
 government could he had sent a very bad letter to the not feed them and there were no buffalo queen
 s representative he had said his in that part of the country they prom indians were going to take the
 indian ised faithfuly to be good and went to supplies out of the store here unless they work for the
 settlers almost every settler were given to them before sunrise i told had a tipi with a sioux family camped
 him i was there to see that they did not near them the squaws did washing and take them that
 my men had orders to chores round the house and the indians put bullets through the first man who cut
 wood and did outside work many of attempted to go into the store and they them engaged with the hudson
 s bay would do as they were told the chief company and cut cordwood along the wilted at once said
 they would do noth river for the steamboats i have heard ing wrong and that they were good lately that
 some of those sioux families indians and would do as i advised them are still in that country and have
 been i had taken the treaty money with me given land by the government and paid the indians there and
 then in 1877 the date had been fixed by giving them their presents and rations the indian department ottawa for
 all to return to their camp thus ended what the cree indians in the carlton district might have been the

 remember was that indians from the hudson s bay stores for gabriel dumont had stated at a public nearly a
 week until the indian supplies meeting after church at the time the arrived i also had to make a trip

 the interior ottawa asking whites out of the country on what authority i had contracted this in 1877 after the
 custer massacre the large account with the hudson s bay sioux indians crossed into canada and company i answered i

 this was the largest white settle had reported fully to lt governor laird indian commissioner ment west of manitoba at
 that time these settlers and other settlers along one action of mine i shall always look the north and south
 saskatchewan be back to with a great deal of satisfaction came very much alarmed and appealed was when i disobeyed
 orders from otto me for protection some of them had tawa and built a stockade round the boats prepared to
 take them down the battleford barracks during the winter of 1876 77 a large number of indians relieved by general
 otter on his arrival congregated at battleford and had to be with troops from swift current fed and after consulting
 with governor in the summer of 1878 most of the laird we decided they should do some battleford and fort
 pitt treaty indians work for the rations they were receiving were out hunting near sounding lake i suggested that a
 stockade round the and asked to have annual treaty pay police barracks might be needed some ments made there chief
 big bear with time and that they should cut poplar a band of non treaty indians and some poles in
 eagle hills to build the stock american indians were also in that ade and this was agreed to i had
 my country governor laird indian corn police teams deliver the poles on the missioner fixed a date to meet the
 ground and had indians and prisoners indians at sounding lake and asked dig the trenches and set up the poles
 big bear and his band to be there he when i reported to ottawa what i had hoped to get
 their adhesion to the treaty done i received a reply that my action as big bear and his followers had
 rewas not approved and that i must not fused to sign the treaty at fort pitt in incur any expense
 chargeable to the 1876 and had always been a disturb department i thought i knew more about ing element governor
 laird asked me conditions and the work went on and to take all my troops available he also after i
 left battleford the stockade was had a detachment of police sent over completed during the rebellion of 1885 from fort
 walsh i paid all the treaty when chief poundmaker and his indians indians there and attended governor raided the settlements
 and burned the laird at several meetings he had with indian agency and other government big bear and his followers
 but big bear and private buildings at battleford some would not sign the treaty and never four hundred women and
 children found did sign one consideration he insisted refuge inside this stockade in danger of on was that there was
 to be no hanging famine and massacre until they were he must have had a premonition of what was to
 happen to him as he was after always wanted to be assisted and adwards hanged for leading the rebellion vised

 stop and if there was any that protects i was always careful to more of it i would arrest him
 and take give them everything that the treaty him into battleford there was no more called for and sometimes a
 little more shooting and we started for battleford and it was this little more that pleased next day them most

 for what was being done for them they agreeable six year s service scientific driving frank pollinger better known by
 the name of ‘ polly the driver on the stewart line of coaches between lethbridge and macleod has the reputation
 of being one of the best drivers in the west montana included and we think he thoroughly deserves it there
 was probably never a more difficult performance in the driving line than that of ‘ polly when he drove four
 horses and a concord coach both down and up the terrible hill across the river without accident except that one
 wheeler fell down which made it all the more difficult the hill must be seen covered with ice and snow
 with deep gullies on either side and very sideling to appreciate what kind of driving is required to make it
 but ‘ polly won t tackle it again and what he won t tackle should not be attempted by anyone

 three passengers started for edmonton in waggons under the guidance of the experienced whip frank borsvat of donald mcleod s
 stage line we started at 11 a m weather mild and the cayuses were with difficulty held in we reached
 scarlett s hotel that evening and although it boasts no spring beds we slept comfortably in our blankets on the
 ground floor early in the morning the sleepless frank arose and howled nearly three hours before the sun lazily arose
 we had to drive 60 miles that day and one of the horses obtained from the hudson s bay company
 was useless in vain frank talked to him expressively in cree french and english he understood none of these tongues
 the whip merely kept him from getting cold but frank s skill overcame all difficulties and we arrived at red
 deer crossing in the evening and found mine host collins ready to provide for all our wants here we took
 to sleighs and fresh horses an ex policeman and another man with their own rigs joined us on our journey
 the next evening we reached battle river and pitched our camp frank was sleepless ex policeman worse he would let
 no one else sleep he succeeded in waking one of the passengers an oblate brother at 11 p m mistaking
 it for morning frank arose and shortly after midnight commenced to prepare breakfast and after threatening and coaxing for the
 next three hours succeeded in getting us on the road the next evening passed without anything worthy of remark except
 a religious argument between the brother and the ex policeman none of us know how long this lasted but from
 the downcast countenance of the ex policeman it was easy to see he had been worsted in the encounter while
 riding in his sleigh he was heard to think aloud what a fool i was to argue with the brother
 about religion as i forgot all about it when i was in the force we arrived at edmonton next day
 having accomplished the trip of 200 miles in four days and a half your space forbids me to tell of
 our return trip suffice it to say led by the gallant donald mcleod in person enlivened by his scottish love
 songs and amused by his mild conversations with the wayward cayuse we landed here in four days from the time
 we started making the best record of the winter season and ending one of the pleasantest winter trips of the

 christmas day although not cold nor stormy was rendered somewhat unpleasant for driving around by a fall of light small
 snow consequently less cutter riding was indulged in than is usual at edmonton at this season when the roads are
 in such superb order christmas services were held by rev canon newton in the masonic hall occupied by st michael
 s church of england congregation no service was held in the other churches in town stores were partly closed and
 the business done was principally of a holiday character a game of football on main street in the afternoon was
 the only public sport indulged in considering the event that is commemorated by the keeping of this day rather more

 we then tcok risks that would not be attempted or tolerated today the all but extinct occupation of river driver
 floating logs down river to the sawmill was fraught with more perils than any other phase of lumbering most men
 will try to tell you that they have undergone great hardships and dangers but only a few can tell you
 truthfully among them are the shipwrecked the plane wrecked the soldiers who have seen active duty in a foreign land
 and those who have taken a log drive down some icy river there are few such hardships it was in
 the spring of 1909 that i driver was really safe until 6 p m and joined the drive then three
 days in quitting time motion on the upper reaches of the red the end of day was ever welcome we

 the river four days later doughnuts and pumpkin pie the next our foreman on the red deer had for problem
 was a soft spot to lie down and become unconscious for a few hours each morning what he seemed to
 regard even river hogs needed a bed so as a witty order maybe it was witty it ran with open
 jack knives we raided the adjacent spruce grove for small boughs jump into it you are neither sugar with which
 to fashion a mattress nor salt you won t melt but no one ever jumped the bravest of course we
 were too wet to go to bed immediately and this contingency invaded those chilly waters gradually had been taken care

 it would be side ci a floating log at least one daily more accurate to say that we became immersion
 was inescapable partly dry our clothing could never have passed of course there was that regular for the easter parade
 we wore heavy feature a sing song as the flames died woolen underwear a heavy mackinaw down to mere embers
 no one thought shirt real not imitation mackinaw of catching a cold and nobody did we heavy mackinaw trousers and
 wool socks were wet anyhow so we merely kept on working the heavy logger s boots were a specialty there
 were only about two brands it was rarely that one of us knew the that could stand up for long
 into the other s name but we were as reckless soles of these boots we screwed the in with nicknames
 as we are today when dispensable sharp calks these required describing prominent personalities as to be replaced from time to
 time when i remember them we had two reds dulled by treading over gravel sharp there was whitey blackie fat

 red river ghosts was carried in the summer 1955 issue he is also the author of the booklet the history
 of walterdale my bed mate was whitey we had two or three key logs down there a tarpaulin and one
 heavy blanket atop below and in front were locking and the spruce mattress then on top of our holding all
 these had to be picked selves we had two heavy w a a 11 e n loose no more men

 thing to do was get out of there i believe we both told the truth and let someone go down
 who would not our work lay mostly at the rear of become bewildered by the surroundings the log drive it
 was always necessary when that mass of logs did break the to drag and roll and push those logs first
 few seconds were very important that had become stranded thus setting ones there were two ways to go once them
 afloat once more you had safely gained the top to the now and then we would come to a boats
 at the rear or to the nearest river great centre jam when the whole of the bank the latter was
 often closer but river channel would be clogged and one must look at that bank but once ere piled high
 with twisting logs here was gaining it look more than once and the where the skilled work and the danger
 shore line rather than the log mass ous work faced us it was never a pleas would seem to move
 ant prospect particularly when we could and here lay danger a misstep a hear the roar of white waters ahead
 foot caught in that shifting crumbling a picked crew would make its way earthquake of saw logs and the rest
 of down over that labyrinth of stalled logs your body had little hope our two boats were held for us
 by ex at times we were unable to loosen pert boatment at the rear it was ticklish those log jams
 by hand and dynamite work at every step now and then the had to be employed whole jam would start
 move a distance our best and toughest rivermen came then clog again at such moments we from michigan and from
 the rivers of would scamper for the boats at the back ontario and quebec some of these men stop when
 the log mass beneath our seemed almost as s u r e 1 o o t e d as feet
 had stopped moving then start squirrels they were products of a hard again for the front no one could have
 school twelve and fourteen hours work trod the top of a volcano more gingerly the work of the river driver
 was hard and than we would pick our way over those dangerous but they were a type of men who
 log jams loved the outdoors and the freedom each day had been their lot together a deep eddy near the
 shore the conwith diet of almost straight salt pork test took place in sets of two men the and beans
 winner of a set was given a few minutes these of course were the regulars but to rest up before
 engaging the winner we were always gaining and losing new of another duo recruits there was only one man who
 had any nor was it all danger and hard work real money to bet on the outcome he with us
 there were lighter moments had been the best poker player and had and our recent recruits almost always all the
 money in camp but macdonald s provided the merriment for the old vet plug tobacco took the place of money
 erans new men invariably tried to learn for betting purposes log riding but few remained long the final event took

 stream with a pike pole half drowned from his ducking but the river drivers in discarding many boisterous moments were
 spent their peavys and pike poles merely laid thus they were as music to half savage down one burden to
 take up another souls i am sure they counter balanced the unaccustomed weight of money in the moments of hardship
 and peril pocket chafed and irritated it was indeed heavy to bear it would be difficult indeed not to recall

 buffalo hunts by victoria callihoo i was thirteen years old when i first ness was made of hides from the
 bufjoined in a buffalo hunt we left lac ste falo anne after the leaves were out on the i always
 used to accompany my poplar trees and our small fields and mother on these trips she was a medicine woman
 who set broken bones and gardens were seeded or planted before knew how to use medicinal herbs the making the
 journey there would be a riders who chased the buffalo were meeting among the leading men as to often thrown
 sometimes by the bulls the exact day of leaving after this was charging the riders horses or by the decided
 on all the families who wanted horses getting their feet in badger holes to join the hunt would prepare for
 the we usually took three carts along we trip our main transportation the red had no axle grease and tallow
 was used instead to lubricate the wooden axles river cart would be overhauled these the carts were very squeaky and
 they vehicles at that time did not have any could be heard from a long way off metal in their
 construction large we from lac ste anne would be first wooden pegs were used where bolts to start as we
 were the furthest north would be used now while small pegs the metis of the st albert settlement answered for
 screws or nails cart har would join us on the way usually there mrs callihoo is one of the oldest
 oldtimers in the lac ste anne district and was recently chosen to open the new museum there an article by
 mrs caliihoo on the iroquois in alberta was carried in our spring 1959 number both were written in 1948 would
 be about one hundred families readily only old ones were used for going on the hunt all streams were fuel
 the buffalo was a very useful aniforded as there were no bridges the mal icr we ate the meat we
 used its saskatchewan river was the largest and hide for robes ropes shelter for our most dangerous and it was
 a relief after lodges foot wear clothes and bags the it was crossed we used to cross at a meat
 was cooked and sun dried and also good ford about where the high level made into pemmican we always bridge
 is now about a day s travel camped close to water we set our tipis south from saskatchewan river we
 in a large circle outside the cart circle usually found the herd riders young a few of the fastest horses
 were kept in men they were would scout on ahead this enclcsure and the others were to see we did
 not run into any enemies herded all night by a night herder for there were no police no law we
 al horse thieving was a very common ocways had a leader in our caravan and currence a fast horse was
 the best p 05 his orders were respected he always session a hunter on a fast horse would had a
 flag flying on the top of his cart kill more buffalo than others with less he led his people ahead
 and we followed speedy ponies there was no money him no one knew whct it was when the herd was
 startled it was we made pemmican out on the plains just a dark solid moving mass we of as the
 dried meat was too bulky to take those days never could believe the buf home a large green hide would
 be hung lab would ever be killed off for there on six posts three on each side so the were
 thousands and thousands we took hide would form a u shape when it was firewood and poles for tipis and
 for tn dry the slabs of meat would be dumped pods on which we hung our thin sliced in the
 u shaped hide and two men on slab meat to dry in the sun we had each end wculd then
 pound the dry meat no matches but got fire from flint and into a pulp then sun dried saskatoons birch
 punk it seems no one was anxious would be mixed and grease would be to start their morning fire as
 we would poured on and stirred to make an even wait and see if any smoke would come mixture when
 this was done it would be out of the tipis and when smoke was packed in robes sewn with sinew
 all seen then there was a rush to get a flame around the hair part outside to keep the or
 coal to start one s own fire pemmican in gocd condition regardless cf the weather these bags were heavy the
 riders of the chase all had guns and it usually took two men to load one single barrel flint locks
 some muzzle on a cart hides would be put on top of loaders with caps bows and arrows the loads
 nothing would be wasted from were used before my time but the crees the buffalo but the bones hoofs and
 and blackfeet still used them then horns the fall hunt the last before win powder horns and ball bags were
 slung ter which would start after haying was on each shoulder at close range the the most important one for
 we had to get guns would kill the animal some riders enough dried meat and pemmican to last rode bareback
 while others had hcme all winter at this time the buffalo would made saddles they were almost flat and be
 fat and calves grown up calves were were stuffed with the hair of the buffalo not killed as no one
 cared for veal any they were beaded on the corners and stirrups were of dry rawhide when the way kill
 was over the women would go out the homeward journey was slow but to help bring the meat in and
 then the who cared the nice sunny days in the slicing of meat began we girls would fall indian summer
 made travelling then keep a little smoke going all day rather fascinating occasionally we to keep the flies away from
 the meat would run into bad weather but we the meat would be hung on rails that were accustomed to
 it and did not mind rested on two tripods at each end as long as we had plenty of the
 best and often we would run short of wood most nourishing food i ever ate in all then a pony
 would be hitched to a cart and we would go out on the plain i made four trips to the
 plains hunting and pick chips buffalo dung on a the buffalo each time was further away warm day this was
 very dry and burned toward south e e peøte 4 s the following are choice excerpts from regular issues of
