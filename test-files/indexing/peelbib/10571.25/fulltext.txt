 the patrician 7 first battalion rifle team activities 1961 by capt ha pankratz with this article capt pankratz the team 
 captain concludes his report on the 1961 activities of the bisley team as the 1961 rifle shooting year began two 
 main tasks confronted the marksmen of the first battalion the first was to train last year s canadian army champions 
 the bisley team to the highest standard possible before the bisley matches in july 61 the second was to develop 
 new shooting talent in the battalion by forming a second team to participate 0:partici 0:pate in the 1961 canadian army 
 championship although to extend the training of the bisley team was a relatively simple task in that it merely involved 
 honest hard work and application the second included the painstaking selection of a whole new team early in november 1960 
 the bisley team embarked on a course of physical conditioning indoor and outdoor shooting plus instruction on the finer points 
 of competitive shooting by the end of january 1961 the second team had completed eliminations and joined the bisley team 
 in the range phase of their training program frequent matches between the two teams under competition conditions served to add 
 a good deal of spice to the range work and gave the second team a good measure of much needed 
 experience by mid may both teams had steadily progressed 0:pro 0:gressed and the bisley team noted with concern and some 
 satisfaction that the second team was rapidly closing the gap between the two at the end of may however the 
 two teams parted company as the second team travelled to wainwright to compete against manitoba saskatchewan and alberta area finalists 
 for the right to represent western command in the canadian army finals at the same time the bisley team entered 
 the british columbia rifle association prize meeting at vancouver to gain additional experience before moving on to bisley england in 
 wainwright the western command championships were fired on the 31st of may and ist of june with teams from 1

 also that each match was won by a bisley team member sgt zwolak ea gave a truly outstanding performance by

 involved in preparations for the trip to bisley all administrative arrangements having been completed the eight members departed from victoria

 bisley were added to those of many friends of the patricia s and supporters of competitive rifle shooting on 25 
 june 61 the canadian army rifle team emplaned at uplands rcaf station for the service flight to england twenty six 
 hours later after stops at gander the azores and marville france the team arrived at gatwick england after a short 
 bus ride the team members arrived safely in bisley camp where they would make their home for approximately one month 
 the next few days were spent getting settled and in making administrative arrangements for further training prior to the actual 
 nra matches which were to begin 10 july 61 the ten day period prior to the start of the bisley 
 prize meeting was spent in training part of the training was devoted to familiarization with bisley range conditions a greater 
 variety of weather conditions rifles which had been modified to meet nra specifications and british ammunition most of this training 
 was devoted to service conditions shooting however all team members got an opportunity to zero 303 rifles before the first 
 competition

 on the total scores of the top eight members using the 300 500 and 600 yard ranges the dcra team 
 won the match followed in order by the royal marines and the canadian army sgt zwolak was awarded a medal 
 for being the highest scorer on his team the nra matches began on the 10th of july with sr a 
 service conditions matches for individuals these matches carried on through two days all of the team members were in high 
 spirits and applied themselves to the tasks at hand spirits soared when the first results posted showed team members well 
 up in the prize lists although no individual matches were won outright by a canadian team member several did break 
 existing bisley records captain pankratz sgt zwolak and lcpl tenta all scored 39 out of 40 in the sitting match 
 to break a 37 out of 40 record of four years standing captain wv hall scored 48 out of 50 
 in the 500 yds rapid match to break a record of six years standing the next two days were devoted 
 to service team matches the first match in which the patricia s entered two teams of four men each was 
 the cheylesmore or falling plates match this match is run off in heats of two teams with the first team 
 to run 100 yards and shoot down its 10 targets being declared the winner both teams were eliminated in the

 target which appears anywhere across a ten target front in the butts the team with the highest total number of 
 hits is declared the winner the patricia s team placed 9th in a field of 12 teams the hamilton leigh 
 or obstacle course competition then followed it is open to teams of four members the competition consists of each team 
 traversing three obstacles within 100 yards between the 400 and 300 yard firing points during the time in which the 
 team is running the obstacles snap targets appear in the butts at the rate of one every 5 seconds until 
 either all targets have been shot down or 15 targets have appeared at which time full time is declared and 
 firing ceases the winning team is that which clears the butts of all targets in the shortest time or at 
 full time has the fewest targets facing it or in the case of ties has expended the least ammuntion the 
 ppcli grey team had by far the fastest time in reaching the firing point however sgt zwolak s back sight 
 had received a bad knock in the process and his shots were landing approximately four feet wide thus when full 
 time was reached there were still two targets facing the grey team the blue team just managed to clear the 
 butts of all targets at full time for 2nd place standing the grey team placed 9th in a field of 
 26 teams the next team match included the four high individuals and four patricia s this was the united services 
 match which combines the scores of the eight team members in the queen mary competition better known in canada as 
 the queen s medal course the conditions for this match were made very difficult by high winds and driving rain 
 the canadian army team placed sth in a field of six teams at this point there remained only one match 
 in which the patricia s could enter a team this was the mappin challenge cup competition which consisted of the 
 aggregate scores of a six man team in three rapid fire matches the matches were 500 yards rapid 200 yds 
 rapid and 200 yds snap having been consistently plagued by bad luck in one form or another a very determined 
 and resolute six man team of patricia s entered this competition with a will to win dogged determination combined with 
 a good deal of skill finally proved successful the mappin challenge cup was won by the patricia s with a 
 score of 743 points closely followed by the team from royal navy portsmouth with 737 and the small arms school 
 corps team with 728 it is worth noting that the royal navy portsmouth team was considered the best rifle team 
 in bisley in 1961 and also considered odds on favourite to win the mappin trophy that evening there was good 
 cause for a victory celebration in the patricia s quarters as many of their worthy opponents called to congratulate the 
 team in the seven days which followed the last team match the team members once more applied themselves as individuals 
 to the exacting sr b style matches although the relative lack of experience in this type of shooting made this 
 task very difficult canadian army members consistently won prize money in all events prize money of the team was all 
 pooled and subsequently divided equally among all members it 
 the patrician 12 marksmanship trophies won by 1 ppcli in 1961 including the mappin challenge cup centre and the hamilton 
 gault trophy bottom centre was with great personal interest that each member watched the totals grow daily until at the 
 final tally it was found that the team had won a little over double the amount won by the canadian 
 army team in 1960 the two most important sr b matches are the queen s prize match and the st 
 george s match each of these is shot in three stages the first stage of each showed some 1800 entries 
 the second stage is restricted to the 300 top scorers of the first stage and the third stage is restricted 
 to the top 100 scorers of the first and second stages combined in 1960 only one member of the canadian 
 army team shot a score high enough to qualify for the second stage of each of these matches this year 
 three members qualified for the second stage of the st george s match as follows captain pankratz 72 sgt mitchell 
 72 and wo2 rowell 70 all scores were out of a possible 75 points wo2 rowell subsequently 0:subse 0:quently qualified 
 for the final stage in the queen s prize match four members qualified for the second stage with scores as 
 follows captain hall 99 captain pankratz 98 sgt mitchell 97 and pte gebhardt 97 all scores out of possible 105 
 points sgt zwolak tied scores at 96 pts with 97 other competitiors who then had to shoot off for the 
 final 13 places on the queen s 300 sgt zwolak was unsuccessful in the shoot off all in all it 
 was a very commendable showing for a canadian army team 
 the patrician 13 the final stage of the queen s prize competition was completed on saturday 26 july 61 and 
 was won by wo2 beckett of the dcra national team the canadian army team joined in the celebration at the 
 canadian pavilion that evening and was host to all of the visiting rifle clubs who called to congratulate the canadians 
 on their big win following the rifle competitions the patricia members of the canadian 0:cana 0:dian army team visited the 
 green jackets depot for three days during this visit the patricia s were treated to the warm hospitality of members 
 of our allied regiment the rifle brigade following an inspection tour of the regimental depot at winchester city the team 
 members visited such places of historical interest as lord nelson s flagship hms victory lord montague s car museum winchester 
 cathedral king arthur s round table and winchester college a picnic trip to the bournemouth seaside resort proved very interesting 
 and relaxing all members enjoyed the visit tremendously and each made several fine new friends in the following five days 
 during which the bisley team waited for rcaf service flight connections back to canada all members were given free time 
 to see some of the more interesting sights of london captain pankratz took an opportunity to pay visits to the 
 lady patricia and admiral ramsay and to mrs a hamilton gault both our colonel in chief and mrs hamilton gault 
 graciously expressed wishes that their best regards be conveyed to all ranks of the patricia s in canada on 2 
 august 61 the bisley team once more assembled its members at nottingham for the flight to canada after a short 
 delay in marville france the flight continued on schedule until the team arrived in trenton ontario a short train ride 
 delivered six members to ottawa while lcpl tenta and pte gebhardt elected to proceed on leave in ottawa on 5 
 august 61 the bisley team and the first battalion second team joined ranks again to compete in the dominion of 
 canada rifle association central prize meeting since the two teams had parted company in june the second team had not 
 been idle after taking part in the western command skill at arms competition in wainwright they moved back to heals 
 range in victoria to further train for the canadian army finals in ottawa training completed they arrived in ottawa to 
 do battle for the canadian army championship on the 3rd and 4th of august lacking somewhat in experience but nothing 
 in enthusiasm and spirit the second team was nevertheless defeated in the main competition the final standings of the participating 
 teams were as follows 1 rcs of i 3673 2 3 r22er 3592 3 army headquarters 3521 4 2 rhc

 patricia s names appeared very close to the top of the prize lists at the close of the ten sr

 returning to victoria the team members were quite content to relax and take some well deserved annual leave rest was 
 to be brief however because one final rifle competition yet remained to be fired to round out a very successful 
 shooting year seven team members entered the rcn s pacific command rifle association annual prize meeting on heals range 7th 
 to 10th september in this series of competitions it became evident that some of the members had gained a great 
 deal in experience for the first time since the team had begun competitive shooting its members began winning sr b 
 competitions as well as dominating the sr a shooting at the conclusion of the sr a portion it was found 
 that patricia s were winners in all matches principle prize winners included the following captain pankratz service conditions aggregate service

 match lcpl tenta 300 yds rapid fire match wo2 green all comers aggregate all of the service team matches were 
 once again won by the patricia team these matches included manufacturer s life match inter services six match and fn 
 ci automatic match it should be mentioned that the royal canadian navy pacific command annually stages this most interesting rifle 
 competition with great success it provides any new shooters in the area with a good opportunity to gain valuable experience 
 and in 1961 it provided a fitting finale to a great shooting year for the marksmen of the first battalion 
 all members of the first battalion rifle teams can look back with pride on their accomplishments in 1961 in the 
 past year and a half the teams and their members have won a total of ninety two trophies and awards 
 it is the devout hope of all team members that their efforts in the past year have helped to emphasize

 the patrician 16 marine magic by col sc waters col waters ivas until recently the canadian army liason officer to 
 the u s marine corps school at quantico virginia he is presently seconded to the department of external affairs for 
 duty the vice president of a well known madison avenue advertising agency was once heard to say in the u 
 s only two things are sacred and free from criticism motherhood and the u s marines and i m not 
 certain i have them in their proper order my impressions after some two and one half years with the u 
 s marine corps as the first canadian army liaison officer would tend to confirm the above comment but i m 
 not sure i can explain why nor can i get any two marines to agree on an explanation hence the 
 rather dramatic title which hints of sorcery and witchcraft but which i am going to attempt to explain by briefly 
 examining their history some of their current training programs and a few other relevant details about the marines this all 
 too brief survey may also assist you to reach your own conclusions as to what makes a marine the symbol 
 of the idealized fighting man in the united states the u s marines were born 10 november 1775 in tun 
 tavern philadelphia not as the progeny of any legitimate union but as the offspring 0:off 0:spring of a then relatively 
 minor uprising which became better known as the american revolution you will note that their birth preceded the declaration of 
 independence in 1776 so that it would not be unfair to state that the u s marines began under the 
 british flag or at any rate while the british thought they still had an american colony these first u s 
 marines were initially called american marines sometimes colonial marines then continental marines but they disappear from history shoi tly after 
 the revolutionary war when in 1787 the war department now department of the army was established and made responsible for 
 all military and naval forces although the marine corps is 186 years old according to its own reckoning the service 
 is not continuous it was not until the effects of french piracy forced the peace loving president thomas jefferson and 
 congress to establish the navy department on 1 may 1798 which was shortly followed on 11 july 1798 by an 
 act to authorise a corps of marines that the u s marines were reactivated with an authorized strength of some 
 33 officers 48 sergeants and 752 rank and file the first official marine commandant was william ward burrows of south 
 carolina an ex officer of the revolutionary army and in the words of washington irving a gentleman of accomplished mind 
 and polished manner this latter date could be interpreted as the legitimate birthday of the u s marine corps and 
 the beginning of their continuous history despite the line from the halls of montezuma to the shores of tripoli in 
 the marine corps hymn the marine combat activities until 
 the patrician 17 about 1900 were extremely limited in size and scope being in all instances less than a current 
 infantry battalion in strength and more frequently with only a small detachment engaged their most notable action was the unopposed 
 and successful amphibious landing in 1898 of a battalion of marines at guantanamo bay cuba during the spanish american war 
 the success of this marine force particularity during its fighting ashore gained the marines national recognition and a fine reputation 
 which aided materially in the rather rapid expansion of the corps and an enlargement 0:enlarge 0:ment of its field of 
 activity a view of the troops of marine barracks here during a sunset parade held on july 23 1954 no 
 report on the u s marine corps is complete unless mention is made of the remarkable archibald henderson who was 
 commandant of the corps for 39 years through the terms of ten presidents from 1820 until 1859 colonel henderson probably 
 more than any other man created the image of the incorruptible indefatigable patriotic and fearless fighting marine it was during 
 his tenure according to distinguished marine bandmaster john philip sousa that the words to the marine corps hymn were written 
 but the author remains unknown sousa also states that the music for the hymn is from offenbach s comic opera 
 genevieve de brabant thus the obscure beginning of what is now one of the best known and perhaps the best 
 publicized pieces of martial music in the world 
 the patrician 18 in 1900 the first real marine brigade was formed composed of four infantry battalions and located in 
 the phillipines the fortunes and strength of the corps now rose and fell in consonance with the military activity arising 
 from the more aggressive u s foreign policy of the early 20th century this resulted in a series of minor 
 campaigns such as the boxer rebellion and the so called banana wars in central america but the first big test 
 was yet to come in world war i during the last months of the war in 1918 the 4th marine 
 brigade the only marine brigade to see action in world war i as part of the u s 2nd infantry 
 division fought gallant actions at belleau wood soissons saint mihiel and argonne suffering some 11 000 casualties or many more 
 than the entire corps casualties during the first 143 years of its existence to stress the intensity of the fighting 
 it is well to note that these casualties all occurred in the last 5 months of the war it may 
 be of interest to recall that the 4 100 casualties received by the ppcli out of some 136 000 for 
 the canadian army during world war i were spread roughly over four years marines charge beach from lcvp s and 
 lcu s the period between the great wars although a relatively quiet period of action saw the birth of the 
 marine amphibious concept and the development of the techniques to support it the strength of the corps had shrunk to 
 about 65 000 by 1941 but the hard core of pioneers in amphibious thought led by general lejeune and others 
 had produced the first u s manual on amphibious doctrine which was to serve so well during the world war 
 ii assault landings this fundamental amphibious 0:amphi 0:bious work proved to be a decisive contribution to allied victory in world 
 war ii the marine strength reached a peak of 470 000 organized into six infantry divisions and four air wings 
 all of which saw action 
 the patrician 19 major marine operations of world war ii it is well to record that the landings on kwajalein 
 eniwetok guam and okinawa were done in conjunction with u s army forces and further it is interesting to note 
 that two other joint army marine assaults russell islands and new georgia also took place what is frequently forgotten is 
 that the u s army deployed some three field armies with 17 army divisions in the pacific war and conducted 
 some 36 amphibious assaults of rct size or larger in which no major marine forces participated in fact the two 
 largest amphibious operations of the pacific the landings at leyte and at lingayen gulf both in the phillipines were purely 
 army navy operations to the general public i believe the amphibious war in the pacific was considered a marine war 
 despite the great disparity in the size of the forces deployed by u s marines and u s army the 
 old magic was still at work and the corps finished the war with an unblemished record and a greatly enhanced 
 reputation with gallant battles like tarawa and iwo jima engraved on every loyal american heart while the u s army 
 actions at places like biak island and leyte were largely forgotten the marine victories in world war ii had cost 
 a total of some 86 000 casualties canadian army in world war ii suffered some 75 000 casualties of which 
 over 30 were received during the six week bitter struggle for iwo jima in early 1945 the start of the 
 gruelling three year war in korea caught the marine corps reduced once more to about 75 000 deployed into two 
 divisions and two wings the hard fought battles of a marine division and a marine wing particularily during the brilliant 
 amphibious landing of x u s army corps at inchon where a marine division was in the assault and the 
 skillful withdrawal of the marines from the chosen reservoir added new lustre to the corps reputation but at a heavy 
 cost some 140 000 casualties were inflicted on the u s forces in korea of which the marines share was 
 30 000 making this the third largest foreign war in u s history after this all too short and simplified 
 omitting for example the development of marine aviation from 1917 to the present where 2 5 of the marine officers 
 and 1 5 of the enlisted men are in aviation look at marine corps history let us turn our attention 
 to the selection and training of u s marines today the enlisted male marine volunteer starts his training if he 
 lives west of the mississippi at the recruit depot in san diego california and if he lives east of the 
 mississippi at the recruit depot in parris island south carolina these two magnificently equipped and impres 
 the patrician 20 sively situated training camps man a 24 hour reception center to meet the new recruit minimum education 
 equivalency grade 5 so that no matter the time of day or method of travel he is met transported to 
 the camp showered shaved hair cut new kit issued and assigned to a platoon in a bewildering blitz of machine 
 like efficiency he is left in no doubt and quickly too that he is now a marine recruit not a 
 civilian and he knows nothing the key men at the recruit centers are the specially selected and trained drill instructors 
 or dls who bear a heavy responsibility for the training administration and discipline of their assigned platoon for the full 
 twelve weeks individual training period upon graduation from recruit depot the recruit is assigned to training regiments in either camp 
 lejeune north carolina or camp pendleton california for a further four weeks of training stressing his role in the section 
 or squad from here he normally goes to a field unit to take his place in the section or squad 
 most senior marine officers claim that the magic espirit is infused somehow during those first hectic highly charged weeks at 
 the recruit depot with the program the setting and the drill instructors having equally important roles to play boot camp 
 rifle exercises log lifting and obstacle course are just part of the exercises the new marines participate in to keep 
 their bodies in good shape the young officer except a military academy graduate coming into the marine corps starts at 
 the training and test regiment in quantico for a leadership physical fitness and aptitude screening course which varies in length 
 from six to twelve weeks depending on the kind of program nrotc college plc he has been following it is 
 here 
 rh e patrician 21 the full impact of his decision to become a marine officer is driven home and it 
 is here the emotional failures the sunshine patriots and the unfit are weeded out the wastage rate varies greatly over 
 a range of roughly 15 to 35 but the survivors who are then sent to basic school are well motivated 
 and well indoctrinated their wastage rate at basic school is quite small generally in the 3 area roll out the 
 barrel students undergoing platoon leaders class at marine corps schools quantico va face the task of getting this barrel across 
 two loose planks suspended between two towers their next problem will be to get themselves over to the other side 
 with the planks basic school camp barrett at quantico is the young officers course and it is probably here that 
 they receive their injection of marine magic exactly when or how the injection takes place is not certain but it 
 is certain that the high quality of the leadership at basic school is the major force that stimulates the transformation 
 of callow youth to confident 0:confi 0:dent leader at the end of the six month course the young graduates are 
 normally assigned to field units to lead platoons as a rule they will serve a total of three years the 
 compulsory minimum for both officers and enlisted men then a high proportion will return to civilian life it is therefore 
 at the two recruit depots the t t regiment and the basic school that the raw civilian a volunteer of 
 high physical standards incidentally is transformed into the model marine it is here the outstanding standards of military dress the 
 high standards of military courtesy the corps traditions of valour and duty and the fundamentals

 a u s navy tour with the exception of marine aviators who instead of basic school go to pensacola florida 
 for 8 months of navy flight training to graduate as naval aviators the u s marine corps today is by 
 law a separate service although it operates with the navy and under the secretary of the navy the marine corps 
 therefore is one of the four army navy air force and marine corps services of the u s defence establishment 
 it is organized into land combat forces service forces security detachments aviation and a reserve component by congressional action a 
 law was passed in official portrait gen david m shoup 22nd commandant of the marine corps 1952 as an amendment 
 to the national security act which specifies that the marine corps will be maintained at a strength of not less 
 than three combat divisions and three aircraft wings to fill this organization the corps has an authorized strength of 190 
 000 with a ready reserve of 160 000 backed by a further 38 000 in the organized reserve this formidable 
 air ground team is currently headed by 58 year old general david m shoup a regimental commander and congressional medal 
 of honour winner from tarawa who is serving a four year term as the 22nd commandant of the marine corps 
 
 the patrician 24 the bare bones of history in this summary may give some idea of the gallant heritage and 
 rich traditions of the corps and the brief notes on current initial training may give some insight into the way 
 the raw material is shaped but what gives the marine his rare spirit and pride what makes the magic difference 
 many marines claim it is the consistently high quality of their leadership at all levels particularly the exacting standards of 
 training discipline deportment and dress as one commandant has said i am plc training program press day for civilian news 
 media was held at training and test regiment to show the type of training the platoon leader candidate receives at 
 quantico vertical envelopment was the highlight of their demonstration as shown by this huge hb2s helicopter unloading its quota of 
 candidates easily satisfied the best will always do others state that knowing you are part of a great team makes 
 you live up to a tradition of greatness some feel that because the marines are small sort of the service 
 under dogs they develop a family closeness and a family spirit this same relative smallness buttressed by their successful fighting 
 record gains them the sympathy of the nation and the support of congress and this is allegedly why a responsive 
 congress always rises to their defence whenever their future is threatened as it has been so many times in the 
 past by the navy army and even presidential pressure most recently during the truman administration 
 the patrician 25 in eugene kinkaid s sombre book in every war but one he compares inter alia the records 
 of the u s army and u s marine ground prisoners of war during the korean conflict particularly the numbers 
 who died during imprisonment which relates to discipline and the numbers court martialed and found guilty of disloyal acts through 
 an enemy technique variously called indoctrination brainwashing thought reform and so on to begin with only 1 in 570 marines 
 were captured as compared to 1 in 150 for the u s army as prisoners only 13 of the marines 
 died against 40 for the army the army finally convicted and punished 8 enlisted men and 3 officers on various 
 disloyal or dishonorable 0:dis 0:honorable acts while the marines discharged 1 enlisted man on proven charges of fraternizing with the 
 enemy although this is admittedly an over simplified summary of a complex and controversial problem the marines are naturally proud 
 of their performance and attribute it in large part to their outstanding leadership discipline and training it is also said 
 somewhat enviously that the marines have the best public relations image in the united states give me a squad of 
 marines and a photographer and i ll make military history one wag is reported to have said another tongue in 
 cheek tale is that the reason lt col glenn usmc was not selected for the first space shot was because 
 there wasn t room for all three in the capsule colonel glenn the marine photographer and the marine reporter the 
 late knute rockne was once asked the secret of the great notre dame football teams that dominated the college circuits

 apart from most other police organizations and contributes strongly to its great espirit and efficiency whatever the reasons or the 
 magic the fact remains that the u s marines hold a unique place in the esteem of their countrymen and 
 continue to set in the eyes of the u s public the standard for a fighting man perhaps the simplest 
 and best explanation of all is in leadership it is only with great leadership that great organizations emerge and it 
 is only with great leadership that great things are done to paraphase napoleon the art of leadership is a simple

 the patrician 26 interim report from ghana by capt ce goodman capt goodman is presently employed as an instructor at 
 the ghana military academy the canadian training team in ghana cafttg was formed in the summer of 1961 in response 
 to a request from ghana for military assistance at present jan 62 the team is composed of nineteen officers from 
 all three services colonel vr schjelderup is the senior member of the team he acts in the capacity of commanding 
 officer and tri service adviser to the office of the high commissioner for canada major rj frost cd and capt 
 ce goodman cd are the other patricia members of the canadian team major frost is the company commander of abyssinia 
 company at the ghana military academy while capt goodman and one other british officer instruct the officer cadets of the 
 company in general military training subjects in addition to this training the cadets also receive a full academic education entrance 
 to the academy is based on education and requires a standard which is comparable to a canadian junior matriculation the 
 equipments used by the ghanaian army are mainly british and the canadian team had to adapt their instruction to them 
 the canadians have been favourably impressed with the 7 62 mm bren gun and the 81mm tampella mortar this mortar 
 has a slight advantage in range over the canadian version of the us 81mm mortor the canadians also teach such 
 subjects as jungle warfare and as most can imagine are slightly at sea on this phase of training some map 
 using exercises are held in the shai hills a forest preserve some twenty miles from the academy the shai hills 
 area abounds in exotic tropical birds baboons leopards small deer and many kinds of snakes some of the poisonous variety 
 whose bite is often fatal to humans it seems that officer cadets are the same the world over no matter 
 what army they belong to the ghanaian cadets have the same trouble in keeping direction that cadets of other armies 
 do including those of the canadian army the canadian team has found that there are many differences in the ghanaian 
 civil and military way of life compared with those of canada and the canadian army for example the formal dress 
 of the canadians is white patrols or white mess kit the ghanaians on the other hand wear red mess tunics 
 the only ghanaians in the mess who wear white jackets are the mess waiters other than this the dress is 
 bush dress in the field and ghanaian no 2 dress in barracks this dress consists of tunic shorts hose tops 
 boots and puttees see picture

 system otherwise all appear to be progressing well the climate takes a little getting used to especially the very high 
 humidity however there is no snow to shovel and this is always a blessing in the accra area there is 
 the surf to enjoy when one can get away to the beach while in kumasi there is a fine pool 
 available to the team members at the training center the most impressive thing about the ghanaian cadets for that matter

 learn all they can about canada

 the patrician 31 first battalion report training exercise co operation i the first national survival exercise of the year was 
 held in early january this exercise was designed to give practice to the control post personnel and to test the 
 communications within the survival force specialist courses also began early in january and were conducted on the cadre system throughout 
 the first quarter of the year on the completion of this training company personnel were returned to their companies in 
 early april the reorganized companies moved up island to train as company teams following hard on the heels of this 
 training came the rehearsals for the goc s annual inspection which was held on 10 april major general g walsh 
 cbe dso cd taking the salute major general walsh has since been promoted to lieutenant general and appointed chief of 
 the general staff practices for the trooping the colour ceremony began on 24 april and lasted until 11 may the 
 actual trooping was held on 13 may two weeks of company training followed the trooping during which time support company 
 elements were integrated into the rifle companies this permitted rifle companies to train as battle groups in the nuclear concept 
 of operations due to the small training areas it was found necessary for the companies to train at widely separated 
 points a coy trained first at nanaimo camp and then moved on to black jack ridge b coy preferred training 
 in the albert head area while d coy trained first in the nanaimo area and then moved along to the 
 tofino area where good use was made of the navy helicopters to lift company patrols into the difficult country it 
 was decided at this time to disband c coy for the summer because of the low strength of the battalion 
 and to spread the personnel of the mighty green machine throughout the unit the road party left for wainwright on 
 11 june under the command of major rj frost cd who was ably assisted by capt cl scott brown the 
 road party made contact with the rail party at crowfoot alta where a national survival exercise ex garden rake was 
 held before the battalion moved on to wainwright camp and the summer concentration the first phase of the concentration was 
 company training under battalion arrangement the emphasis during this phase was placed on night training the major complaint from company 
 commanders was that company training was restricted to a great extent because of the number of personnel engaged in practicing 
 for the sports events and weapon competitions the exercises were all interesting but the one that was enjoyed most of 
 the battalion was exercise punch bowl 13 15 jul this 
 the patrician 32 the escort to the colour present arms to the colour 
 the patrician 33 was a two sided exercise with 1 ppcli representing the fantasians attacking across the battle rivers while 
 1 qor of c acted as defenders second patricias provided the umpire and control staff required in addition c coy 
 2 ppcli under capt now major len howard was attached to bring the battalion up to the strength of four 
 rifle coys the crossings of the battle river were carried out by night with skill and determination the emphasis placed 
 on night training during phase one the moving cross country by night phase particularly proved profitable as all companies arrived 
 at their objectives by first light the commanding 0:com 0:manding officer lt col rf bruce mbe cd had an interesting 
 time commanding the battalion while playing hide and seek with a whole company group of the queen s own immediately 
 after the goc s exercise and despite lack of sleep the battalion picked up and returned its defence stores filled 
 in slit trenches and then moved to a concentration area on the edge of camp where both stores and vehicles 
 were cleaned the men showered themselves and changed into clean clothes before leaving alberta to slip behind the tweed curtain 
 on its return journey the road party was commanded by major agw harbord harbord cd as major frost was posted 
 to ghana during the concentration period the train journey back was pleasant but it was fortunate that the battalion was 
 well practiced in loading and unloading drills because for some reason of his own the cnr engineer pulled the train 
 into the outer vancouver yards detached the engine and left this proved to be a great annoyance to everyone as 
 there was only just sufficient time to catch the ferry to victoria after some heated words with the railway officials 
 the train was moved into the station quickly unloaded and all ranks spurred on by the gentle urgings of the 
 rsm were in time to catch the ferry home august was leave month for all save a few who were 
 required to keep the wheels turning among these were capt mac lean s transport section both drivers and rceme mechanics 
 who were preparing for an exercise in september and the annual rceme inspection in october their efforts were well worth 
 while as the vehicles worked well on the long convoys and the unit received an excellent grading on its vehicle 
 inspection returning from leave the battalion started a new training year by giving a demonstration of a mobile survival column 
 to over 400 mayors and reeves in vernon it is interesting to note that almost ten years had elapsed since 
 a formed body of patricias had visited in vernon after this the battalion proceeded on to exercise chilcotin this exercise 
 took place in a dnd training area located 34 miles west of williams lake the area which lies near some 
 of the largest ranches in north america is approximately 12 miles by 12 miles square and is on a high 
 plateau dotted with stands of poplar mixed fir and pine it is a beautiful part of the country which contains 
 numerous lakes and some large hills the dominating feature being a neck like mountain called the dome the battalion bivouacked 
 in an area used by the rcsme in the

 big september demonstration at vernon in which military and civil defence personnel participated summer close by one of the largest 
 lakes in the area and did several small exercises everyone found the country to be very interesting as well as 
 beautiful in fact most soldiers preferred this location to wainwright 0:wain 0:wright the only sour note being struck by one 
 realist who was heard saying beautiful or not the digging looks pretty hard following the return from exercise chilcotin the 
 battalion settled down to specialist courses and range work which fully occupied everyone until christmas sports and competitions first aid

 september the unit was host to the west coast tri services track and field championships first battalion competition in this 
 was complicated by the fact that the battalion other than the competitors was on a national survival exercise at vernon 
 which was followed by an exercise in the chilcotins the competition proved to be keen and the battalion came second 
 to the rcn the national tri service soccer championship general pearkes trophy as 1 ppcli soccer team had won the 
 tri service championship trophy in this area for the 60 61 year they were privileged to participate in the pearkes 
 trophy championship series held in ottawa due to administration difficulties over transportation it was rather doubtful if the battalion team 
 would leave at the last moment however after several false starts they were despatched from chilliwack as the battalion was 
 on the way to vernon although the team was very different from the one that had won the local championship 
 last year they put up a good fight but were beaten in the semi finals the battalion soccer team is 
 now participating in the victoria combination saturday division league consisting of eight teams at present the battalion team stands first

 fortunately there were not as many injuries as in previous years the cup was won by support company when they

 of a sports centre by the municipality of esquimalt approximately five blocks from work point barracks at the present time

 company groups held their own smokers and were responsible for providing their own entertainment while a suitable liquid prize was 
 offered for the best organized company smoker and the best entertainers everyone was surprised to learn how much acting talent 
 was available in the battalion the judging committee 0:com 0:mittee was composed of the commanding officer with the rc and 
 protestant padres due to the quantity and spirit of the shows they had a most difficult choice to make but 
 finally awarded the prize to hq company on a sunday afternoon several days later in order to take full advantage 
 of the talent available rsm jg austin mc cd organized a concert using the best acts from each company this 
 proved to be an immense success and ran to two performances one for the battalion and again by special request 
 for the supporting arms when they arrived in the area time gun in october and november the battalion was involved 
 in one of the typical victorian tempests in a tea cup which had as its center the time gun this 
 gun from a practice originating many years prior to the war is fired at 1200 and 2100 hours the time 
 gun is fired by a member of the anti tank platoon of the battalion on a signal received from the 
 gonzales observatory previously the only complaints received were when due to some interruption in phone service or for some other 
 reason the gun was not fired then the commanding officer the adjutant and the orderly officer would be flooded with 
 calls from various retired mflitary gentlemen who wished to know what was wrong with the modern army in the fall 
 of the year however a new batch of ammunition was received for the time gun this ammunition which was designed 
 to better simulate artillery fire under field conditions contained a larger charge than the type used previously in a few 
 weeks there were many complaints in the local press and radio regarding the discomfort to local residents caused by the 
 loud report of the new round all ended well however as higher authority acted with commendable speed and took tiny

 but rather to mention the highlights of the more important ones the regimental birthday was celebrated in traditional fashion with 
 a broom i loo game against the sergeants mess after a hard fought contest the sergeants emerged victorious and received 
 their reward in the officers mess that evening a formal ball was held which was a success even though some 
 of the officers had a tendency to limp the weekend of 8 10 april saw various festivities take place to 
 mark the turnover of command from lt col jc allan dso mbe cd to lt col rf bruce mbe cd 
 these activities varied from the extremely informal subalterns brandy breakfast for lt col allan to the formal dinner dance in

 and welcome the bruce s coming with pleasure the trooping reception took place on 13 may from 8 00 p

 a number of informal supper dances were held with great success during the year the food and music provided at 
 these generally took some foreign theme which although surprising to some was generally agreed to provide stimulating entertainment moving into 
 the field in no way caused a lessening of the social activities of the mess on 24 june about a 
 week after the unit s arrival in wainwright the mess entertained the brigade commander and his staff the various commanding 
 officers and those officers who were to be attached to the unit during the summer a large attendance made this 
 event an enjoyable evening for all the following week on 30 june the annual regimental party was held at 1 
 ppcli which attracted members from the second battalion the regimental depot and other patricia s in the vicinity the theme 
 for the evening was italian and the mess was decorated with tac signs and other appropriate signs reminiscent of regimental 
 activities in italy during the second world war the games night at which the officers compete against the senior nco 
 s was held at the sergeants mess this year the officers managed to win by a narrow margin and so

 the patrician 45 thanks to the winter works programme and some good planning it was possible to remove an old 
 stairway enlarge the ante room and panel it and the main entrance in mahogany this was completed in march but 
 it was not until september that the new rugs and drapes arrived the rugs are a deep red and the 
 drapes are a gold giving a very pleasing effect when contrasted with the mahogany panelling in addition water colours of 
 scenes in france and belgium of 1914 1918 vintage painted by cpl mclaren were suitably framed and hung december saw 
 much activity in the mess starting with carol singing on the 15th and the subalterns christmas dinner on the 16th 
 however what really launched the mess into the christmas spirit was a cocktail party given by the company commanders and 
 the second in command for the rest of the officers and their wives both the sergeants at home to the 
 officers on the 22nd and the officers at home to the sergeants on the 29th were their usual successes the 
 former was so successful that a number of officers did not wish to leave despite restrictions imposed by the liquor 
 laws as new year s eve fell on sunday the pmc major mc edwards his committee and staff are to 
 be congratulated on the ball which ushered in the new year sergeants mess the social season in the sergeants mess 
 started off with the at home to other messes on 2 january 61 this event was well attended as usual 
 with guests from several naval and reserve army messes in the area the old timei s night was held on 
 27 january this night gives members an opportunity to renew acquaintances with the honourary and associate members and to meet 
 new members the success of the evening points to it becoming an annual affair on the occasion of the colonel 
 in chief s birthday the traditional broom i 100 game with the gentlemen of the officers mess was played by 
 a devious scheme the officers succeeded in locking up the sergeants team in an empty building this foul deed was 
 unsuccessful however as the sergeants escaped through a coal chute in time to appear at the field final score officers 
 0 sergeants 2 the day concluded with the regimental birthday dance a mess dinner was held 7 april in honour 
 of rsm wol jg austin mc cd after dinner members engaged in a games tournament consisting 0:con 0:sisting of bridge

 from as far away as camp borden 
 the patrician 46 june saw the mess preparing for wainwright as a send off a giant smoker was held a 
 presentation was made to rsm austin the mess in victoria then combined with the officers mess for the summer period 
 on returning from wainwright the annual sergeants mess picnic was held at albert head b c a babysitting clinic was 
 available for those who attend and stayed for the dance in the evening the annual fishermen s derby was bigger 
 and better than ever this year the fish were co operating for a change ssgt and mrs lekivetz took top 
 honours for the biggest salmon rsm rudd caught his first fish a 10 lb coho but it wasn t in 
 the winning class at homes were held in december with the sergeants at home to the officers on the 22nd 
 and the officers at home to the sergeants on the 29th and as usual everyone went home happy a new 
 event was tried this year a cocktail party was held on boxing day for the members and their ladies due 
 to its great success this will undoubtedly become an annual affair the year wound up with a gala new year 
 s ball there was a capacity attendance of just over 300 guests and a good time was had by all 
 corporals mess the new year opened with a round of mess functions well attended by all members despite our lack 
 of adequate facilities these consisted announcement the management of victoria van storage co ltd wish to announce the opening of

 including the canadian legion army and navy veterans plus a multitude of commercial teams congratulations on being the undefeated unbeatable 
 champions of vancouver island march was highlighted in true first battalion style by a ball held in observance of the 
 birthday of our colonel in chief the evening was pronounced a success by all and sundry dancing to the mellow 
 strains of the troubadors continued until cock crow and dawn broke over the blue pacific april seemed a comparatively quiet 
 month with little happening other than a small spread of assorted cold cuts salad cheese and salami the sportsmen in 
 our midst took advantage of the sunshine in this the fairest province of them all to participate in a round 
 of golf or an afternoon of fishing our golf enthusiasts cpls anderson atkinson crook and couronne are out fibbed only 
 by our fishing friends such as cpls mcalpine bonar boyce and richardson the arrival of the merry month of may 
 saw near perfect weather and members began developing healthy looking tans may also brought a flurry of activity in preparation 
 for trooping the colour the ceremony carried out in perfect precision maintained the high standards of the first battalion the 
 all ranks garden party following the ceremony was well attended thirsts were quenched appetites sated and old acquaintances renewed gradually 
 the crowds dispersed as one and all prepared for the annual trooping the colour ball it was a festive evening 
 in all respects and the mood was one of gaiety and celebration never had the mess hall been decorated so 
 profusely members and guests waltzed and tangoed until reveille much of the success of the evening was due to the 
 efforts of our hard working mess steward cpl les richardson and his most capable staff with the advent of june 
 the packing of stores kit and equipment for wainwright concentration commenced and mess functions ceased for the balance of the 
 training year in august the garrison was organized to operate with a skeleton staff and the remainder of the battalion 
 proceeded on annual leave this was the signal for our corporals mess to become a composite canteen all too soon 
 annual leave ended and golf shoes had to be abandoned in favor of boots and puttees in september our members 
 were despatched on company and platoon training to almost all points of the island and in some cases to the 
 lower mainland october ended in grand style with a hard times dance all those who can remember said they had 
 a whale of a time while those who can t remember concluded that they must have had or they would 
 have remembered this affair was a staggering success thanks to our mess committee 
 the patrician 48 december brought the annual christmas festivities the children s christmas party in which some of our members 
 participated was a great success the christmas dinner in the men s mess was just like the meal mother used 
 to try to make but never quite succeeded the year 1961 concluded with our annual corporals mess new year s 
 ball which was held in the unit mess hall an anticipated 300 guests gave way to an attendance of over 
 400 persons men s canteen the men s canteen had a busy and successful year starting with the new year 
 s eve ball which was enjoyed by all present the next two months were spent in a relatively quiet manner 
 as most of our members were on courses here in victoria or at other locations all this however did not 
 interfere with our celebration of the regimental birthday on march 17 after witnessing the bloody battle between the officers and 
 sergeants on the broom i loo field all ranks proceeded to the drill hall for the usual free beer and 
 fun that night to the music of a navy dance band we danced into the small hours an important factor 
 in the success of this dance and others has been the readiness of the naval apprentice music section at hmcs 
 naden to supply us with a good orchestra the trooping in may was the next important event on our calendar 
 following the parade an all ranks reception was held on the sports field the dance that night was one of 
 the most successful and best attended of all the canteen s functions and much of the credit for this success 
 must go to the rce band from chilliwack who supplied us with an excellent dance band the extra curricular activities 
 of the canteen came to a stop after this because of the summer concentration and the annual leave period the 
 fall started off in good style with a hallowe en dance and the introduction of happy hours on the second 
 and fourth fridays of each month this last feature has been a popular and well appreciated innovation which promises to 
 be fully and enthusiastically supported by all members of the canteen in december once again completing a full cycle christmas 
 dinner was served in the men s mess by the officers and senior ncos this provided a good send off

 the regimental depot training an average of twelve platoons concurrently throughout twenty two platoons were graduated and seventeen more are 
 still in training all begin training with a complement of one officer five assistant instructors and forty men during the 
 winter months the depot was allowed to use the albert head victoria training area as the severe winter weather makes 
 field training in the edmonton area virtually impossible this was greatly appreciated by all ranks as all were looking forward 
 to another unprofitable winter training year in camp wainwright alberta the albert head camp commenced training recruits on the 21 
 november and remained open until the 14 april 62 the wainwright detachment began training in early march and of course 
 with this extra administrative load the depot was at odds to make ends meet however all ranks bent to the

 the patrician 57 second battalion report in 1961 the second battalion continued to set a strong pace in a great 
 number of activities national survival skills again occupied an important position in the training schedule but as individual survival skills 
 were integrated into recruit training at the regimental depot the battalion was able to place less emphasis on them and 
 to progress to more important survival operations winter warfare airborne and airtransported 0:air 0:transported training was combined and the skills 
 involved in this type of training were practiced in detail during the winter months nuclear warfare at all levels occupied 
 the spring and summer months along with the usual number of unit and army courses besides taking part in a 
 number of ceremonial parades the battalion engaged in sport drill musketry and other inter company competitions thereby putting to the 
 test many team and individual skills associated with soldiering today training january and february brought to a climax the winter 
 training period on winter warfare and airborne and air transportability skills company groups trained in winter warfare near devon in 
 december and early january exercise shakedown 11 designed to prepare for exercise snow chinthe 11 an airborne air transported exercise 
 was planned troops deplaning from a c 1308 hercules aircraft at camp wainwright during exercise snow chinthe 11 february 1961 
 
 the patrician 58 for mid january but it was delayed a week due to a shortage of snow in wainwright 
 a little snow did come and on the 25th of january a company parachuted into wainwright to establish an airhead 
 the remainder of the battalion went through the drills of an air transported move through the rcaf base at namao 
 some chalks actually did load into aircraft and fly to wainwright but the majority went by road three days of 
 tracking down and destroying the cunning enemy force under capt as wagstaff brought the battalion to a peak of readiness 
 for exercise snow chinthe 11 exei cise snow chinthe ii again exercised the battalion in its role as part of 
 the defence of canada force the exercise was conducted at wainwright but to practice the battalion in a long range 
 move an advance base was set up at fort nelson bc and wainwright simulated an area near whitehorse as in 
 exercise shakedown i an airborne assault was required to establish an airhead a reinforced airborne company group with battalion headquarters 
 staged through fort nelson where the co made his final plans for the assault on the seizure of the airhead 
 the remainder of the battalion followed up and deployed as an economy measure the remaining elements moved direct from namao 
 to wainwright the airhead centred on the main airfield just west of wainwright camp and the battlefield over the next 
 few days stretched to the ribstone creek area in the south east corner of the training area there was really 
 too little snow and the weather was mild for february but everyone went through an excellent conditioning period and the 
 cease fire indicating an early return to edmonton was very welcome the remainder of february and march was spent mainly 
 on trades training companies were reduced to small effective strengths as the course programme shifted again into high gear support 
 weapons signals new soldier training and other courses occupied most of the battalion and a number of all ranks took 
 courses at various corps schools across canada collective training in tactics began in april company groups rotated through wainwright training

 carried out in the spring an intensive programme was begun to give everyone his six stars 1 indicating tests or 
 training completed unit courses began in october and continued through november on the 23rd of october however all turned again 
 to the problem of national survival two days of training preceded a practice of our fan out system that began 
 exercise ground zero iv the exercise was designed to test all phases from warning through re entry everyone was rudely 
 awakened in the wee small hours of october 25th and hurried into barracks as one soldier was heard to remark 
 you can t feel safe in your own bed any more after a quick marshalling the battalion moved to morinville 
 to await the orders for re entry and the next day carried out the re entry operation within the barracks 
 area several pmqs were cleared of simulated casualties provided by the regimental depot and this added some realism to the 
 exercise the co operation of the families occupying the homes was greatly appreciated the months of november and december saw 
 the emergence of the 4th battalion into a full strength unit a company s build up of manpower and separate 
 training programme for the us exercise great bear was nicknamed 4th battalion a 48 hour airborne company group exercise in 
 wainwright beginning 8 of november was followed in early december by battalion winter warfare training at rocky mountain 0:moun 0:tain

 house a company was pitted against the other three rifle companies in an exercise designed as training for exercise great

 great success editor the ottawa branch is very active in trying to get patricias together and have extended an open 
 invitation to all members past or present to attend the branch s functions whenever they are in the ottawa area 
 montreal despite the fact that our official activities have been limited to the annual meeting we have had a very 
 satisfactory year with several visitors adding to our pleasure and much meeting between individual members and groups of members however 
 before chronicling the above mentioned activities we wish to record with regret the passing of george t harris no 487540 
 and walter a hoskin no 1215 both of whom will be remembered in all parts of the country among our 
 visitors were mr and mrs arthur milne now living in brighton england during their lengthy visit to canada several other

 time to attend a meeting of the local branch which was presided over by paddy crofton and attended by another

 officers mess at mcgill university our guest speaker was jack mclaren of dumbells fame who journeyed from toronto where he 
 has been a guiding light for years in the affairs of that branch jack s reminiscences delivered in his marvellously 
 droll manner alternately brought shouts of delight and sighs of nostalgia from his audience we had a good turnout of 
 members and some very welcome

 a year is not enough and it was announced at the annual meeting that arrangements have been made for a 
 second gathering during the coming year the date has been set for november 17th and the scene of the action 
 is molson s brewery surely an appropriate place we invite all patricias to join us on this auspicious occasion it 
 was also announced that the possibility of holding a joint meeting of the ottawa toronto and montreal branches probably next 
 may is being explored great satisfaction over this was expressed by those present finally at the annual meeting the incumbent

 the patrician 95 exercise tombstone territory by major av robbins ppcli major robbins is presently employed as the canadian exchange 
 officer with the royal australian army and was an official observer on the exercise tombstone territory exercise tombstone territory was 
 a joint british australian tri service exercise conducted in western australia the feature role in the exercise was played by 
 the royal navy s new commando assault carrier hms bulwark which was on a visit to australia from its base 
 in singapore my family and i arrived in perth the capital of the state of western australia on the 9 
 jan after a 2300 mile road journey from our home in canberra this trip would be roughly equivalent to driving 
 from toronto to vancouver but across and under vastly different conditions than would be found in canada for more than 
 1300 miles the route skirts the semi arid region which lies immediately north of the great australian bight this area 
 is truly part of the outback as the australians say and the outposts of civilization here may be anything from 
 two to three hundred miles apart as space will not permit the telling of our experiences on this trip it 
 is sufficient to say that the driving conditions on the eyre highway which stretches from port augusta in south australia 
 to kangoorlie in western australia compares unfavourably with the old dawson creek highway circa 1946 those patricias who took part 
 in exercise muncho of late 1946 will remember that route vividly shortly after we arrived in perth i was informed 
 that i would be leaving at 0530 hrs 10 jan with a party of press people for geraldton australia where 
 we would find and board hms bulwark geraldton a small port some two hundred miles north of perth would be 
 bulwark s first port of call in australia the royal marine commandos of the bulwark would be put ashore here 
 to establish the umpire communications nets for the exercise in the tombstone rocks area some one hundred miles further down 
 the coast i arrived at the western command mess at 0330 hrs and by 0530 hrs 10 jan we had 
 boarded an raaf dakota aircraft and were airborne for geraldton we touched down at the airstrip there before 0800 hrs 
 but even by this early hour the hot shimmering rays of the sun could be seen and felt as they 
 reflected from the tarmac daily temperatures of over 100 degrees are common in this part of australia these high temperatures 
 last for weeks at a time there was no sign of the bulwark when we arrived however shortly after 1000 
 hrs her great bulk loomed over the horizon soon a whirlwind helicopter was launched from the deck of the carrier 
 and was thrashing its way shoreward with the message that the swell was too heavy to 
 the patrician 96 launch the landing craft assault and that we would be picked up and flown out to the 
 bulwark on her arrival off geraldton by this time excitement was mounting in this small town and most of the 
 townsfolk 0:towns 0:folk had gathered on the foreshore to watch the proceedings they were soon rewarded by the exhilarating sight 
 of a ten helicopter flight of whirlwind craft from the carrier some carrying small citroen cvs slung beneath them the 
 helicopters flew over the town and landed on the airstrip where they unloaded the cvs and the marine party responsible 
 for setting up the umpire communications the move of the helicopters from the airstrips to the town cricket oval caused 
 a mass migration from the waterfront to the oval at one stage it appeared as though the children milling around 
 the oval would bring the landings to a halt and it was only through the efforts of soldiers and local 
 newspapermen that the field was cleared thus enabling the whirlwinds to land in safety finally with a minimum of fuss 
 and bother we were issued life jackets shown how to inflate them and put aboard the copters i suppose that 
 the life jackets were an integral part of the modus operandi but quite frankly i was convinced that they would 
 be of little value if ditching became necessary as the waters along this part of the coast are known to 
 contain most varieties of man eating sharks only recently sharks were caught in geraldton harbour proper this was a fine 
 outlook for an amphibious exercise in this particular area however these thoughts were quickly dispelled as we became airborne and 
 were soon wind milling at wave top level out to the bulwark some twelve miles off the coast incorporated 27

 the patrician 97 this i think would be the best place to briefly explain the commando carrier concept and how 
 it was evolved the united states marine corps first developed the concept known as the vertical assault which is a 
 major departure from the normal pattern of amphibious operations the commando earner makes this type of operation possible and is 
 an attractive contribution to modern strategy it can be employed as a single unit in the anti terrorist small brush 
 fire operation or as an integral part of a larger naval task force in a conventional amphibious assault it provides 
 the means whereby a force can be held at sea out of sight of land yet at instant readiness to 
 intervene ashore without disclosing its presence hms bulwark and a flight of copters from 848 naval air squadron the helicopter 
 borne commando of the carrier can join land operations on ground of its own choosing leaving the defender in ignorance 
 of the point of entry until the very last moment troops can be withdrawn or re deployed almost as quickly 
 as they were landed for speed is the keynote of the helicopter assault the vulnerable sea passage and the critical 
 stage of crossing the beach inherent in the amphibious assault are eliminated in the helicopter assault further and within certain 
 limitations the commando with its floating base is for a time entirely independent of logistic support from shore installations in 
 january 1960 the royal navy commissioned its first commando carrier hms bulwark and embarked 42 commando royal marines and 848 
 naval air squadron flying westland whirlwind mark vii helicopters 
 the patrician 98 it was this carrier that appeared at the critical moment in the persian gulf approximately one year 
 ago and put a damper on iraqi aspirations to take over the sheikdom of kuwait it should be emphasized and 
 this is a personal opinion that the commando carrier operating alone in anything 0:any 0:thing but the anti terrorist or 
 bush fire operation would be a very risky business indeed the commando carrier possesses virtually no protective armaments of its 
 own and is little more than a floating helicopter pad marine barracks and vehicle and equipment transporter this then was 
 the ship we touched down upon on the 10th of january to be immediately welcomed on board by the captain 
 and the commanding officer of 42 royal marine commando with typical royal navy efficiency and hospitality we were quickly relieved 
 of our bags and escorted below to the ward room for a welcome cup of tea it was not long 
 before i discovered that i was not a complete stranger amongst these sailors and marines captain pat scarf introduced himself 
 and wanted to know about his old friend major arthur potts captain ronnie holgate talked about patricia officers who had 
 been classmates on a recent course at the canadian army staff college major dick bavain had recently spent some time 
 in calgary with the queen s own rifles and was in fact more up to date on canada than i 
 was at lunch the captain came up to me and enquired for rick and kate captain dalglish turned out to 
 be the brother in law of major constant s wife and knows the regiment well these completely unexpected associations made 
 the next twenty hours on board very enjoyable and proved once again to me that the world is indeed a 
 very small place and the regiment is known throughout its length and breadth the rest of the morning was spent 
 in a conducted tour of the ship some years ago i spent a few days on hms triumph which i 
 believe was a fleet carrier of the same class as bulwark and therefore i was able to compare the modifications 
 that had gone into converting bulwark to an assault carrier outwardly there was little difference from its fixed wing counterpart 
 except on the flight deck where the arrestor wires and barriers had been removed and nine helicopter roundels had been 
 painted the after end of the deck looked like a vehicle compound the vehicles parked in this area naturally restricted

 the patrician 99 of the ship but these could be struck down into a hangar when all the helicopters were 
 ranged on the flight deck during full operations the major internal alterations were the provision of accommodation stores and offices 
 for the commando of 600 all ranks conversion of her flying facilities to operate helicopters and re arrangement of the 
 operations room to cater for the joint naval and military command of the force provision of the four lcas at 
 davits was also a major modification in the conversion of bulwark to the assault carrier role but for a final 
 briefing on the exercise which was due to start the following morning the afternoon was devoted to sport playing volley 
 ball on a flight deck which was neither vertically nor horizontally stable was a new experience a movement which the 
 naval and marine personnel seem to have mastered with great efficiency to the detriment of their visitors just before last 
 light the special boat section took off in three helicopters bound for the enemy coast their task to locate and 
 mark the pre selected helicopter landing sites which would be used by the commando at first light the sbs was 
 to be put down some ten miles from the area in which the assault was planned by march route during 
 the hours of darkness they would carry out their allotted task we had flown low over this particular area on 
 the way up from perth that morning and from the air it looked very rugged indeed as none of the 
 lads in the sbs had ever set foot on australian soil before they would undoubtedly find the bush into which 
 they were being lifted vastly different to the country in which they normally trained another factor against them was the 
 blackness of the nights at this time of the year in this area i was doubtful about their chances of 
 success and said so to the young marine officer commanding the party prior to their take off he agreed that

 completely confident of the outcome in the end a small wager was made and i regret to say i handed 
 him a bottle of scotch later in freemantle 0:free 0:mantle in payment of the bet breakfast the following morning at 
 0400 hrs even at this early hour the meal was perfectly prepared and served by the chinese cooks and ward 
 room stewards who i gather are recruited in hong kong after breakfast i attended a final briefing of v troop 
 in their mess deck this was the troop to which i had been assigned for the exercise i was impressed 
 with the thoroughness of the briefing the detailed planning at the troop level and the obvious enthusiasm of all members 
 of the troop i might explain that a commando has five such rifle troops a support troop consisting of a 
 mortar medium machine gun antitank 0:anti 0:tank and assault engineer platoons a headquarters troop and of course a small command 
 element after the briefing i adjourned to the flight deck to watch the fly in which by this time was 
 in full swing the whirlwinds are capable of carrying only four marines with their full operational equipment and consequently it 
 takes five sorties by each of the eighteen operational helicopters to lift the rifle troops of the commando ashore this 
 is far from a satisfactory state of affairs and although the whirlwind is highly regarded from the reliability point of 
 view much 
 the patrician 100 improvement on this lift factor is expected from its planned replacement the westland wessex the procedure of 
 organizing individual marines into aircraft sticks assembling sub units by sticks in their respective mess decks calling sticks forward to 
 the waiting hangars and flight deck and finally loading the sticks into the correct helicopters is to say the least 
 an involved operation the success of the procedure seemed to depend on accurate load manifesting and for this purpose small 
 four man manifest cards are prepared the weight of an individual marine and the exact weight of the equipment he 
 is carrying become critical factors when operating helicopters that have such marginal payload and fuel capacities therefore the manifest card 
 carried by the senior member of each stick accurately records names individual weights plus equipment carried lift off time chalk 
 number and helicopter identifying letter emplaning procedures are controlled by a marine operations officer permanently attached to the carrier this 
 officer is located in the command 0:com 0:mand post high in the island of the carrier and uses the ship 
 s public address system to direct the operation to start the operation nine helicopters are spotted over loaded with fuel 
 and lift off to hover well above the ship another nine aircraft are immediately spotted loaded with fuel and the 
 marine sticks who have been waiting in the wells of the flight deck are escorted forward and loaded into their 
 respective machines this wave lifts off and departs for the beach while the aircraft hovering above the ship land and 
 take on their loads by this time they to rent to buy to lease to sell p blij here at

 the patrician 101 have used the excess fuel with which they were originally loaded once the first two waves have 
 departed subsequent lifts are completed as individual aircraft sorties at a minimum turn around tempo which goes on unabated until 
 the operation is completed control of the operation on the flight deck is maintained through assistant flight deck officers at 
 each aircraft pad they in turn are assisted by a multitude of people including aircraft handlers fuel men escorts for 
 sticks and even relief pilots speed is the essence of the operation and the teams compete with each other for 
 aircraft turn around honours as the senior member of each sticks boards an aircraft he hands the manifest card which 
 he has in his possession to a member of the flight deck crew after the aircraft has departed the card 
 is immediately passed to the operations room and thus it serves to augment the record of those individuals as well 
 as those sub units which have been lifted ashore from the tally board which is maintained in the operations room 
 it is possible to ascertain at any given time the progress of the fly in the emplaning drills of the 
 commandos and the aircraft handling drills of the flight deck crews are a picture of co ordination and precision the 
 aircraft are handled in much the same manner as on conventional aircraft carriers the movements signals and gesticulations performed by 
 the members of the flight deck crews remind one of a ballet troop that has been trained to the peak 
 of perfection these people have indeed developed their individual drills and skills to the point where they display a grace 
 of precision that would i am sure match anything to be seen at covent garden truly it is fascinating to 
 watch by a mere landsman being completely absorbed with the actions on the flight deck i had not noticed the 
 passing of time i was brought back to reality when a marine corporal handed me a life preserver and said 
 i would accompany his stick ashore in a matter of minutes after joining the stick in the wells at the 
 edge of the flight deck we were escorted at the double to a waiting helicopter within seconds of settling in 
 the aircraft we were airborne and flying towards the shore and a landing site some four miles inland exercise tombstone 
 territory was under way and it was with some feeling of regret that i watched the massive hull of the 
 bulwark disappear in the early morning haze that hung on the face of the indian ocean the exercise itself is 
 again another story which space will not permit telling here it was extremely interesting for me to be observing these 
 very fine units 42 royal marine commando and the australian army s special air service company exercising against each other 
 under very difficult conditions both units displayed great efficiency and dash for seventy two hours under conditions of terrain heat 
 lack of water flies and insects that i personally had never experienced before my last exercise had been snow chinthe 
 11 and i am now convinced that cold weather warfare training has certain merits which i heretofore never realized existed

 the patrician 105 crossing the savio river ltaly oct 1944 a flashback on a coy ppcli crossing the savio river 
 this article was compiled from material donated to the patrician by sgt bunting ec ppcli ret who typed most of 
 it personally while he ivas serving with maj gen vc yokes at 2 bde hq in italy editor since the 
 end of the second world war many ex servicemen have nostalgically journeyed along the paths of memory to fight a 
 hard battle over again or to react their part in some long since forgotten play these nostalgic interludes are often 
 triggered by some insignificant happening such as seeing bill smith for the first time in many years and wondering where 
 you saw him last it might be that you saw bill last playing his particular part in one of the 
 battles of the second world war it may even have been in the battle of the savio river crossing for 
 those patricias who were in the fight for the bridgehead over the savio river we have a special treat an 
 account of the battle written shortly after the actual operation by the then commanding officer lt col rb clarke ably 
 assisted by major now lt col ret ew cutbill who was the oc a coy for the crossing the scene 
 october 44 italy area cattolica the princess patricia s have just come out of rest and by the 12th of 
 the month begin a series of moves with the object of manouvering the battalion into position for the next operation 
 on 16 oct the bde comd lt col mp bogert dso now maj gen mp bogert held an orders group 
 at which he outlined the bde attack plan the seaforth highlanders of canada were to lead the attack and had 
 the task of forcing the enemy from the pisciatello river the loyal edmonton regiment were to follow with the task 
 of taking over the attack once the seaforths bogged down the seaforth attacked on the night 16 17 but their 
 attack was stopped just short of the river by stiff enemy resistance the eddies moved through and managed to gain 
 a two company bridgehead over the river col clarke now takes the story from here ppcli moved through the bridgehead 
 against the intermediate objective south egidio with the intention of subsequently forcing a crossing over the savio river and establishing 
 a bridgehead the battalion advanced and after a series of company leapfrogactions 0:leapfrog 0:actions d coy encountered the enemy in 
 strength 600 yds east of south egidio by 1415 hrs one platoon of d coy was pinned down and the 
 coy had lost two of it s supporting tanks to enemy sp guns firing at close range arty fire could 
 not be used to support d coy 
 the patrician 106 due to their close proximity to the enemy however a coy was sent against egidio at 1500 
 hrs to relieve the pressure on d coy the exposed pi of d coy was extricated and the company as 
 a whole withdrawn 1200 yds a coy reached south egidio by 1800 hrs and a pincer movement was started on 
 upperchurch an area 300 yds ne of south egidio a coy attacking from the sw and d coy from the 
 east by midnight and after some stiff house to house fighting the area of south egidio was firmed up and 
 d coy sent a fighting patrol to la chiaviche little further resistance was met by the bn until patrols of 
 b and c coys made contact with the enemy on the west side of the savio river lt col clarke 
 held orders at 1400 hrs and outlined his plan for the establishment of the bridgehead over that river the bridgehead 
 was to be established on a frontage of two coys a coy crossing left in the area where the bridge 
 was to be thrown across once the bridgehead 0:bridge 0:head was established d coy was to be right in the 
 crossing and about 300 to 400 yds north of a coy the attack went in a 1700 hrs and immediately 
 both coys ran into heavy mmg mor and arty fire from the west bank a coy wireless 0:wire 0:less set 
 no 18 set was put out of action and their progress was uncertain until daybreak however from the noise of 
 battle it was assumed that they were in close contact with the enemy d coy was pinned down almost immediately 
 but managed to regroup and consolidate on the near bank lt col clarke has this to say about this phase 
 of the savio river crossing a coy was a mystery machine for some time and it was not known whether 
 or not they had gained the far bank until one of the a coy sergeants had re crossed the river 
 and explained the situation to me major cutbill explains the a coy battle from here the following is an exact 
 transcription of the report made by major cutbill after the action ppcli report appendix story of the part played by 
 a coy in the crossing of the savio river as written by maj e cutbill oc a coy ppcli during 
 the morning 20 oct the coy moved up to an area 600 yds south of rimani and there made itself 
 comfortable at about 1500 hrs i attended cos o gp dealing with orders for an attack to be launched across 
 the r savio this afternoon two coys are to form the bridgehead 0:bridge 0:head my coy attacks on the left 
 using the road immediately in front of c coy at snake as a sl the coy bridgehead is very limited 
 and includes c medri and c saladna both of which are about 350 yds this spelling of rimini is from 
 the original report editor 
 the patrician 107 west of the river fd and a tk arty mmgs mortars together with fire from b and 
 c are to paste the area and known enemy positions in rear from h 10 to h hr after that 
 harassing fire and fire on demand will be brought down hhr is set for 1630 hrs which will mean a 
 mad rush with little time for recce and orders this is later changed to 1700 hrs which still means not 
 a moment to spare the co offers a touch of the whip then i meet my pi comds and quickly 
 give them the story csm wood marches the coy to the fup some 2300 yds distant 0:dis 0:tant while my 
 o gp goes ahead by carrier at that time there is only 40 mins until h hr we make a 
 brief recce of the route river crossing and objective from c coy area then await the coy in the fup 
 the barrage comes hhr arrives but no coy owing to the distance they had to march and the amount of 
 bogged traffic to by pass they reach the fup twelve mins late i get the old man on the set 
 and he says push off when ready but don t count on sp fire in a few minutes we are 
 set the lead pi under lt scott moves off followed by the second pi l sgt whitford then coy hq 
 and the reserve pi sgt buckberry the jerry doesn t waste any time no sooner has the lead pi crossed 
 the sl than all hell comes down on them and the balance of the coy my three stretcher bearers are 
 committed then and there and do not marry up with the coy until many hrs later we push on under 
 observation from the enemy 600 yds away until the forward pi just can t go forward any further owing to 
 mg mortar and arty fire i try the set but heavy interference prevents asking for arty fire there is only 
 one thing to do so we do it that is to deploy well and move around on the right where 
 there is the odd bit of cover it is a slow job and a number of the lads get shot 
 up or step on mines which are all over the place as we draw near the river an mg 42 
 opens up from about 50 yds range and really lets us have it i wonder what percentage of tracer he 
 uses it looks like a silver arrow flying at one the river crossing is a mad scramble but as the 
 current is swift we make a slow crossing and that 42 doesn t seem a bit embarrassed by our presence 
 nor do his arty and mortars arriving under the friendly protection of the west bank i count our strength we 
 are 17 all ranks that is not good csm wood l sgt whitford sgt sparrow and myself are the only 
 ones above cpl rank in the party the fire is still heavy on the other side of the river and 
 it is now nearly dark we wait a short time then one man is sent to recce back to find 
 out the reason for the delay he returns but is alone we assume the remainder of the coy to be 
 either pinned down or wounded a quick recce and i decided to shove on to our objective there is a 
 draw leading towards c medri a small recce patrol goes ahead 
 the patrician 108 but has not gone far before it draws a burst from an mg 42 which is covering 
 that line of approach pte davis out ahead volunteers to sneak up on the position he is a brave fellow 
 but his courage unfortunately is halted by a burst received in the stomach and before many minutes he is dead 
 there is nothing to be gained by waiting so we decide to follow the river bank south until we can 
 find another line of approach to c medri about 200 yds further on a thick hedge running back from the 
 river looks like just the thing the searchlights are on now and i am afraid we will be silhouetted unless 
 we follow a covered approach it seems that we make a lot of noise but either jerry is resting or 
 just allowing us to enter his parlor anyway we get about 60 yds distant from the casa and there hold 
 up to see the lay of the land our 18 set by the way was knocked out in the crossing 
 so we don t know if the coy on our right was successful the casa looks very big and imposing 
 and might well put up a couple of pis i ask sgt whitford to send out a two man patrol 
 from his pi to find out the score the two stout hearted men melt into the artificial moonlight and all 
 is still they return shortly and report that four sentries guard the building and there is considerable movement nearby what 
 to do next attack the house with the benefit of surprise perhaps and hold on until relieved it sounds ok 
 but suppose he is strong or suppose he counter attacks at dawn and besides we have no communications to tac 
 and it is doubtful if any tactical success could be achieved by holding a casa in the middle of jerryland 
 and not be able to poke our nose outside the door without drawing fire still we can t sit doing 
 nothing so let s continue the recce then find a good position and send back a runner with the gen 
 that decided off we push in a northerly direction we almost trip over what looks like a dug in position 
 before covering more than 400 yds quite right that s what it is we form a rough ring around it 
 pronto and the csm hauls some grenades out of his belt and chucks them in the entrance result three jerry 
 prisoners and two others permanently out of action the racket must have been terrific so we grab the hitlerites and 
 run hell bent for leather towards the river our next step is now solved north side lsffiffisl jv south side

 the patrician 109 what could be simpler that to send the pw back under escort the escort then to return 
 here with a new 18 set after reporting to the co and getting 0:get 0:ting further orders sgt sparrow volunteered 
 to re cross that bleak fireswept 0:fire 0:swept 600 yds over mine fds to c coy area and deliver the 
 goods off he goes and the rest of us finding a good spot where the bank is quite high commenced 
 that old fashioned pastime of digging in we of course take all the usual precautions of posting guards etc and 
 within an hour we feel secure we wait and wait finally at 0400 hrs sgt sparrow returns and brings with 
 him a few of our lads who had been pinned down earlier our strength is now 35 all ranks sparrow 
 has an 18 set and orders from the co for us to hold the fort here until relieved thats ok 
 by us 21 oct came the dawn and spasmodic enemy mortar fire of the moaning minnie variety jerry i think 
 is wondering what the score is and does not yet know we are still here right in his lap on 
 the other hand we are not sure he hasn t pulled out i get sgt buckberry now with us again 
 to send out a recce patrol it returns with the news that yon hun has some beautiful dug in positions 
 all around us at about 75 yds distance and is there with flags flying so to speak from then on 
 things begin to happen over comes the big stuff he says to hell with 20 rpg per day and just 
 lets it slide right over with no economy at all the worst of all is moaning minnie which is also 
 the most accurate we spit dirt he then gets nasty and takes up a position on a wooded promontory 50 
 yds away enfiltrating our position and lets fly with an mg 42 that s no bwana one of my better 
 shots keeps that position peppered up while we resume our watch sure enough on the other flank he is trying 
 to counter attack we threw a wall of steel at him and he withdraws meanwhile c coy can bring down 
 mmg fire on the flat open ground immediately beyond the bank where we are dug in this duelling continues on 
 and off all day several times the situation gets quite critical fortunately we silence the position on the promontory but 
 it is necessary 0:neces 0:sary to send out a fighting patrol under cpl baker in order to quieten two other 
 positions which are troublesome this patrol killed four and captured six jerries good show higher formation wants information of enemy 
 defences etc so sgt sparrow again volunteers to make the perilous trip he delivers the information but on his return 
 trip is wounded we are all very hungry and thirsty having had no food since noon yesterday worse still our 
 ammuntion is getting low it makes you think arty df fire proved its worth to us more than once the 
 enemy seems to take a dim view of it and shuts up like a clam for a while after each 
 pounding another trouble we have is the rain it has already caused two of our caves to collapse and it 
 was a race to dig out the occupants before they smothered 
 the patrician 110 about 1530 hrs the csm goes over to c coy and thence to tac hq to keep 
 the a wheels rolling ammunition and ration arrangements cas etc he returns later with news that the sh of c 
 and ler will attack through us tonight that makes us very happy the weather also approves because it stops raining 
 for a half hour but not longer 2000 hrs rolls around preluded by a barrage of terrific proportions our arty 
 shells and mmg bullets whiz overhead and miss us by what seems a hairs breadth lets hope there are no 
 shorts and i hope to god our own infantry don t attack us we see the advancing troops some distance 
 away silhouetted clearly against the searchlights d coy sh of c arrive in cave avenue i give their coy comd 
 full particulars of the enemy and the ground his coy moves out but is stopped by heavy mg fire he 
 then calls for 3 mortar sp and covered by fire from every weapon in our coy he is then able 
 to move forward from the bridgehead shortly after a carrying party from c coy arrives with much needed ammunition and 
 supplies multi bwana we remained put until 0800 hrs 24 oct by which time the bridgehead had been sufficiently enlarged 
 for us to move into casas and there dry out and stretch the legs and start anticipating what the next

 the patrician 111 the history of the ppcli band by capt ha jeffrey the original musical formation at the time 
 of the regiment s inception in 1914 was a pipe band though still in existence at the close of world 
 war i this band appears to have been dissolved shortly after probably on the final disbandment of the wartime forces 
 with the establishment of the canadian permanent force in 1919 the ppcli military band was formed under the direction of 
 a former scots guards director of music captain tw james musicians from british and colonial regiments were accepted into the 
 band the early twenties witnessed a tremendous upsurge in the popularity of military band music and the ppcli band from 
 its modest beginning early found its way into the musical spirit of the times achieving prominence at the british empire 
 exhibition in england 1924 the band was further engaged to give a series of concerts at the principal london theatres 
 it broadcasted from the savoy hill radio station which at that time was the largest broadcasting station in europe on 
 returning to canada after the tour the band stationed in winnipeg was honoured by a visit of the distinguished composer 
 rachmaninoff then touring the north american continent he conducted the band in his famous prelude in c minor and pronounced 
 his great pleasure at the competent performance of his composition the retirement of captain james in 1939 brought the band 
 under the direction of lieutenant a l streeter the autumn of that year with its attendant world conflict saw the 
 inevitable disruption in the band s continuing progress the younger members accompanied the regiment overseas on active service in europe 
 where they were able to maintain a small band using equipment loaned to them by some british music firms lieutenant 
 streeter was given the assignment of organizing canadian bands from among the troops stationed in europe as an interim wartime 
 measure however it was to be several years before the ppcli again had its own band the re establishment of 
 the canadian permanent force in 1949 permitted the activation of military bands and the ppcli now stationed in calgary set 
 about the task of restoring its musical lustre of former years within two years a small but competent group of 
 musicians had been formed captain a brown was appointed director of music and the band appeared to be firmly established 
 once more by the spring of 1953 the band boasted a strength of twenty men it was sent to korea 
 to take part in the coronation ceremonies of the commonwealth brigade a busy schedule of concerts one in conjunction with 
 the tokyo police band occupied the remainder of its tour in the far east until its return to canada in 
 late july in the meantime an energetic recruiting campaign was now showing successful results the band was joined by an 
 increasing number of musicians arriving from britain and holland by september of that year the unit was finally at its 
 fully authorized strength of fifty five musicians in ceremonial uniform of scarlet tunic navy blue trousers 
 the patrician 112 and white helmet the ppcli band was now able to provide the music and colour so long 
 absent from the western military scene on captain brown s departure to take command of the royal canadian engineers band 
 captain fm macleod became director of music many and varied were the engagements undertaken by the band of particular note 
 was its performance at the british empire games held at vancouver in the summer of 1954 where it combined with 
 other bands of the canadian forces to present a colourful and impressive spectacle that will long be remembered by those 
 present new year s day 1957 saw a change over in directors captain ha jeffrey who like his predecessors was 
 a graduate of the royal military school of music assumed command of the band preparation now began for the band 
 s forthcoming nato commitment which necessitated a tour of duty with the canadian brigade stationed in europe the arrival of 
 the ppcli band in germany during the autumn of that year was the beginning of an extremely active two year 
 schedule the first event of note was the band s appearance in the netherlands on the occasion of queen elizabeth 
 s state visit to that country in 1958 her royal highness personally complimented the band on its fine performance 0:per 
 0:formance at nato s tenth anniversary celebrations the ppcli band shared with other bands the honour of taking part in 
 a massed parade of troops of nato forces at mainz germany of numerous tattoos and military ceremonies in which the 
 band took part its performance at the royal tournament britain s foremost military show made history by the fact that 
 it was the first time ever for a canadian band s inclusion in this display in 1959 a journey to 
 the gaza strip found the band much in demand amongst the units of the united nations forces daily concerts were 
 given to the many troops stationed in the desert it was after this tour that the band became known as 
 the most travelled unit in the canadian army returning to canada at the onset of winter 1959 the band took 
 up residence in edmonton which city had since become the regiment s home station its regular duties of military parades

 the patrician 113 west coast trek by lt rm macintosh during the first week of june 1961 the reconnaissance platoon 
 of the first battalion undertook to trek from the west coast of vancouver island to great central lake in the 
 island s interior the trip was to cover 50 miles and take four days the route led from sea level 
 to 4000 feet over the highest single waterfall in the commonwealth and down again to 300 feet the fact that 
 the expedition failed may cause the reader to wonder as to the worth of the story in its failure the 
 expedition provided a number of lessons for anyone who contemplates moving through like terrain it also provided some vivid memories 
 for those who went along on the trip during the spring the reconnaissance platoon underwent considerable training in preparation for 
 the annual concentration subjects such as map using patrolling communications night driving and physical conditioning 0:con 0:ditioning and water obstacle 
 crossing were covered a final exercise was intended to encompass all these aspects of training but it appeared for a 
 number of reasons principally the difference in the terrain to be encountered that it would not be feasible in its 
 place it was decided to undertake a cross country trek that would involve many if not all the facets of 
 training and would also confront the platoon with a challenge the decision to attempt the crossing of the island range 
 north of tofino was taken after considerable map reconnaissance including a trip to tofino and to great central lake by 
 the platoon commander these two localities were to be the beginning and end of the trip permission for the trek 
 was granted by the commanding officer and arrangements were made with the rcmp to provide water transportation to the head 
 of bedwell sound and also for a water taxi to pick up the platoon at the west end of great 
 central lake it was decided that each man would carry 45 50 lbs and that the four day ration would 
 be the issue ifr minus the bulky non essential items supplemented by bacon boiled eggs dried fruit oatmeal and cheese 
 extra equipment consisted of 100 ft of polyethelene rope a felling axe several handaxes flashlights first aid kit dark goggles 
 and a 22 calibre rifle in the event that any grouse were encountered this gear plus personal kit was to 
 be carried on aluminum frame packboards just prior to the beginning of the journey the platoon moved to tofino and 
 participated in exercises against d coy at this time conversation 0:con 0:versation with local people disclosed that although trips had 
 been made through the area they had been done later in the year following the snow melt aerial photos could 
 not be obtained for the current year but those taken in 1959 revealed that the area around delia lake at 
 4000 ft was frozen and covered with snow though the platoon lacked 
 the patrician 114 snow equipment it was considered that it would be able to move through this area safely and 
 reach a lower elevation quickly from the lake which provides the source for delia falls the route was to lead 
 down the course of the falls to drinkwater creek and then out to great central lake on saturday the third 
 of june in the early morning the party consisting of eleven all ranks embarked on an rcmp launch at tofino 
 and left on a two hour trip to the head of bedwell sound the boat moved up the fiord like 
 inlet to a spot near the mouth of the bedwell river and there the platoon was ferried ashore in a 
 skiff here at the mouth of the river were several shacks the remnants of earlier logging operations and in one 
 of them was found a rather surprised carpenter he believed himself to be the only person within many miles and 
 was busily engaged in constructing a cookhouse for an outfit that was to build a road up the bedwell river 
 to a gold mine the journey from sea level began in bright sunlight along a gravel road that had been 
 built during the war years when sitka spruce was needed for the production of mosquito bombers in the first hour 
 while the trekkers were still in the river delta two black bears were surprised foraging along the road about ten 
 o clock the grade became steeper as the road moved into the timber and sweat began to run freely from 
 the brows of the marchers lunch found the platoon still in the sun on the bank of the river in 
 a small gorge here several of the group took the opportunity to bathe their hot feet in the near freezing 
 water of the river shortly after lunch the platoon came upon an abandoned gold mine the watershed of the bedwell 
 has for over sixty years provided gold seekers with sometimes encouraging results and a very interesting half hour was spent 
 moving amongst the deserted equipment and diggings the march was resumed and this time the route led along the north 
 bank of the river the platoon was surprised to find themselves walking along a planked road which had been labouriously 
 constructed at least 25 years previously the road was built of rough hewn planking which was reinforced in steep parts 
 by iron stripping it was learned later that compliments of esquimalt autamcdic bowladrome bert nelson prop 1225 esquimalt rd phone

 the patrician 117 a lone prospector had spent all his earnings in an attempt to construct a road to his 
 diggings and then had died before he could realize the benefits of his work later that afternoon the party crossed 
 the river on a series of logs and continued to make their way upstream through the dense salmon berry and 
 salal cover camp for the night was made at 1900 hrs beneath several large cedars the area appeared to have 
 been used as a stopping place by others and it provided a good campsite for the weary group that had 
 covered 15 miles with their forty five pound packs since 1000 hrs a large fire was soon started and the 
 evening meal was cooked everyone then dried out their sweat soaked jackets and shirts little time was spent in conversation 
 and by 2130 hrs the platoon were asleep beneath the cedars close by the roaring river in the morning a 
 heavy mist lay on the river and it was feared that rain might follow however after a filling breakfast of 
 mush bacon and boiled eggs the marchers moved off looking toward a day that would tell whether or not the 
 trip was to be successful the altitude was already 700 feet but in the next four miles the platoon was 
 to climb to 3000 feet and find out whether a crossing of the island range would be possible the trail 
 became less visible and sometime was lost while picking the route through the underbrush by 0900 hrs the trekkers reached 
 the junction of you creek and the bedwell river here they followed the former waterway as it headed abruptly up 
 towards the mountains the steep walking began and tump lines were utilized to shift the balance of the pack loads 
 forward the mist by now had been burned off by the sun and another gorgeous day lay ahead about noon 
 high on the bank of you creek the platoon came upon the re opened diggings of the you creek gold 
 mine this claim has been worked off and on since 1912 and now is being brought back into production by 
 a syndicate which uses helicopters for re supply and movement of personnel the group looked through the diggings and followed 
 an open vein which ran up the cliff face before pausing for lunch following lunch the platoon crossed you creek 
 and started up towards the snowfields the climb became quite treacherous in places as the melting snow produced a run 
 off that created mud and loose gravel in the most accessible climbing spots at times the route was almost vertical 
 but it was felt that this route was necessary to reach a high elevation as soon as possible in order 
 to determine the depth and condition of the snow by 1600 hours the snowfield had been reached and the platoon 
 halted and brewed up while the platoon commander made the decision whether to proceed or not a re section located 
 the group slightly to the right of their intended course but high enough to be able to determine the route 
 ahead to delia lake and the falls the five miles to delia lake lay across a snowfield the melting crust 
 of the snowfield was leaving treacherous soft spots that would have to be avoided or a man would fall through 
 to his waist also if the slopes were to be traversed steps would have to be cut an l the 
 expedition did not have ice axes furthermore there was also the possi 
 the patrician 118 bility of injury on the snowfield evacuation in such a case would be difficult particularly if the 
 weather closed in these factors plus rations and time available were weighed before it was decided to turn back the 
 trip was not impossible but without proper snow equipment for camping or climbing it was highly questionable the men were 
 bitterly disappointed to say the least as last and longing looks were taken at the unachieved objective before the return 
 trip started little can be said of the remainder of the days travel except that it was apparent that the 
 expedition would have to make remarkable time if they were to reach the mouth of the bedwell in time to 
 board the rcmp boat which was to return on monday 5 june to pick up the marchers in case they 
 could not get over the mountain that night the party had a poor campsite selected in haste as a result 
 of marching till darkness however fires were made and a flask of brandy provided some cheer to the dispirited group 
 before dawn rain began to fall bringing the good weather to an end the tempo of the march to the 
 sea quickened by the hour and by 1200 hrs the platoon had reached a point well down the bedwell river 
 instead of looking for a log jam to provide a crossing it was decided to fall a large spruce to 
 serve as a bridge the axemen worked in relays while lunch was eaten till finally the tree fell as planned 
 the crown landing on the far bank to the great annoyance of the onlookers the spruce then proceeded to break 
 in mid stream and gaily floated down river rather than meet disappointment with another sap laden spruce it was decided 
 to move further downstream and ford the river the afternoon brought a typical west coast rain storm which completely drenched 
 everyone in a matter of minutes it continued for the rest of the day by 1800 hrs the sea was 
 reached only to find that the rcmp launch had left an hour before they waited three hours longer than originally 
 planned the only means of transportation back to tofino was by means of a small tug used by the road 
 contractor to bring in his supplies he agreed to move the platoon the next morning and for the night he 
 provided them with a drying room and a shack in which to bunk down by 1000 hrs the next morning 
 the expedition was back in tofino and later that night they arrived home in retrospect the trip provided an opportunity 
 to test the group s ability to move through the coastal terrain the men stood up extremely well there were 
 no injuries only hurt feelings at not being able to complete the trek as planned a similar group properly equipped 
 and trained could accomplish the trip failing that a trip later in the year would probably miss the snow altogether 
 except at delia creek where the snow remains year round the journey left a feeling of accomplishment with the platoon 
 as well as a determined desire to return at some future date and successfully complete it 
 the patrician 119 memorial plaque dedication ceremonies by major rb mainprize in mid 1960 the united kingdom branch of princess 
 patricia s canadian light infantry association submitted a proposal for the erection of a plaque in st george s memorial 
 church in ypres belgium to the founder of the regiment and all ranks who died during the 1914 18 war 
 the executive committee of the association approved the proposal submitted and considered this to be a project for that branch 
 a committee proceeded with the detailed planning and in this connection a great deal of credit is due to mr 
 george hancox who worked unceasingly for its successful fulfillment in august 1961 army headquarters approved the request for the attendance 
 of a regimental party at the ceremonies this party to consist of the commanding officer and rsm of 1 and 
 2 ppcli the regimental depot two buglers and the former commanding officer of the depot on the bth of october 
 the regimental party from work point barracks consisting of lieutenant colonel rf bruce major rb mainprize rsm wol aj rudd 
 and drum major sgt harris f departed for edmonton the party stayed the night with the rcaf at sea island 
 proceeding to home station via rcaf scheduled flight the following morning the group was warmly welcomed on arrival and spent 
 a most enjoyable three days renewing old acquaintances and of course conducting official business bright and early on the 12th 
 of october the complete regimental party departed from rcaf station namao via ci 19 aircraft in addition to those previously 
 mentioned the group now consisted of lieutenant colonel cja hamilton major dor kearns rsm wol jg austin rsm wol rh 
 appleton and private gow wn the trip to trenton was uneventful and on schedule arriving there approximately 2120 hours the 
 following morning we were transported by dnd bus to ottawa arriving shortly after noon as we were not scheduled to 
 leave until 2000 hours from uplands airport it was decided to take a room in the lord elgin hotel to 
 be used for changing ablutions etc we found to our dismay that the room was quite small but by moving 
 sideways and stepping over luggage we all managed in some manner or another colonel t defaye had a luncheon arranged 
 at the headquarters officers mess for the officers of the party which was attended by most patricia officers serving at 
 army headquarters at the conclusion of the luncheon colonel defaye presented a retirement gift to lieutenant colonel aj baker on 
 behalf of all serving patricia officers immediately following the luncheon the officers of the regimental party broke up and visited 
 1 major r b mainprize cd editor 
 the patrician 120 various officers at army headquarters all officers paid their respects to the director of infantry colonel pr 
 bingham about 1800 hours a message was received that the flight to marville would be delayed slightly as the aircraft 
 scheduled for the flight was delayed on a flight from england on arrival at the airport we found to our 
 delight that colonel defaye was accompanying the regimental party swelling its ranks to ten we learned from the movement control 
 officer at this time that we would not be travelling by comet aircraft as previously advised but by north star 
 and that our arrival time would alter appreciably as would the route the journey to marville france via gander and 
 lajes in the azores was noisy and long but otherwise comfortable we arrived about 0300 hours on the 15th of 
 october and by the time we cleared customs and immigration arrived at our respective messes about 0400 hours the officers 
 and sergeants messes were still quite lively as a party was just winding up in them both after several nightcaps 
 we the officers decided it was time for some sleep and attempted to find our quarters some of the directions 
 given were slightly faulty and after stumbling around in the dark carrying our baggage for a considerable time and with 
 tempers getting short we eventually found the quarters allotted to us it is suspected that the rsms didn t bother 
 with any sleep later in the morning two drivers complete with staff car and kleinebus from 4 canadian infantry brigade

 the patrician 121 about 1200 hours the party departed from marville for mons the loading of the two vehicles initially 
 took a little organizing and was resolved with the five officers travelling in the staff car while the rsms and 
 buglers travelled in the kleinebus with the baggage split between the two vehicles marville is located just over the border 
 from luxemburg and about an hours drive from verdun the trip to mons 
 the patrician 122 took approximately four hours through a very pretty countryside the journey was punctuated periodically by groans from 
 the back seat of the car issued by the writer concerning the lack of springs in the middle of the 
 back seat sympathy from the remaining passengers was completely 0:com 0:pletely lacking they weren t sitting there some of those 
 people subsequently 0:sub 0:sequently sat in that position and appreciated the discomfort of that particular seat after registering at the 
 hotel grande in mons the party immediately proceeded to the museum located just off grande place in rear of the 
 town hall established 1458 ad we were met there by the curator who led us through the various exhibits this 
 museum the musees dv centenaire is the ancient hotel of the seigneurs of enghieu founded in the 14th century and 
 is considered the finest british war museum on the continent it contains british canadian and german souvenirs found on the 
 two battlefields 23 august 1914 and 9 11 november 1918 including drums flags uniforms pictures weapons and battlefield maps in 
 addition to a large collection of other items mons is steeped in history and to go into its history would 
 entail much more space than is available in this article its origin is believed to date back to 57 bc 
 when a roman camp was established during the roman conquest the town has been dominated by the french dutch and 
 austrians since the belgium revolution in 1830 belgium has been independent and since that time mons was occupied twice by 
 the germans for 41 and 42 months respectively 23 august 1914 to 11 november 1918 19 may 1940 to 2

 the patrician 123 following the tour of the museum the regimental party was joined by the remainder of the long 
 battlefield tour party and adjourned to a pub where introductions were made the next morning at 0900 hours the party 
 proceeded to the town hall and were officially welcomed by a representative of the burgomaster champagne and cakes were served 
 to the assembled guests and the party was taken on a tour of this historic building the red ensign was 
 flown from the flag mast in honour of the occasion it is interesting to note that at the village of 
 casteau 5 miles north east of mons on the mons brussels main road corporal thomas 4 dragoon guards fired the 
 first british rifle shot of world war i towards the german outposts of the 4th cuirassiers at dawn on the 
 22nd of august 1914 the outposts of the 116 th canadian battalion stopped at this very spot upon the cease 
 fire on the 11th of november 1918 at 1100 hours following the tour of the town hall the veterans group 
 of the tour party proceeded to albert where they were joined by the regimental party at about 1300 hours it 
 was during the trip from mons to albert after a couple of frustrating occurrences changing money and endeavouring 0:endeavour 0:ing 
 to get gas in cambrai that the regimental party shrugged their collective shoulders and decided to adopt the policy if 
 you can t beat them join them an excellent lunch was served to the tour party in albert this was 
 preceeded by a few warming glasses of rum that put a number of people in a very jovial mood after 
 lunch the tour party had a short visit to the frise and parvilliers areas arriving in amiens for the night 
 before proceeding to the hotel the party toured the very famous and beautiful cathedral which dates back to the 13th 
 century at 0800 hours on the 17th in a drizzling rain the party left amiens for beaumont hamel via albert 
 this was the only place on the tour where the original trenches were still visible it was here that the 
 newfoundland regiment was decimated at the commencement of the somme offensive in july 1916 a magnificent memorial huge bronze moose 
 has been erected at this location by newfoundland to her gallant sons who died there in the 1914 18 war 
 the 51st highland division memorial stands just in rear of where the german front line trenches were prior to the 
 commencement of the somme offensive after this interesting visit we proceeded to arras via buquoy to the hotel chancey to 
 pick up george hancox who had been taken ill previously and had remained at the chancey george was still too 
 ill to join the party so taking our leave we proceeded to vimy here we were joined by the members 
 of the short battlefield tour this visit was most interesting and enlightening both parties toured part of the enormous tunnelling 
 project where british and canadian troops lived and fought for so long during world war i the ground in this 
 area is practically solid chalk little if any shoring or revetting was necessary in the construction of the tunnels or 
 associated dugouts this was followed by a visit to the nearby canadian and german trenches which are in places no 
 more than 25 yards apart here we also saw some of the many craters which 
 the patrician 124 had been caused by a series of mines being exploded by both sides by the time we 
 went to look at the vimy memorial the rain was pelting down this memorial contains the names of all canadian 
 soldiers who were killed in world war i and overlooks the quite flat countryside to the east of vimy ridge 
 time was pressing and after a too brief stay the party proceeded to bully via givenchy and lens lunch was 
 served at the hotel modern in johnny s restaurant johnny is an englishman who served with the british army in 
 france in 1940 married a french girl and after world war ii took up residence in bully he has established 
 a very fine modern hotel that caters to the thousands of british and canadian visitors who yearly visit this part 
 of france following lunch mrs johnny announced that she operated a very fine perfume counter where the best french perfumes 
 were available at a cheaper rate than anywhere else in france most members of both groups proceeded to this counter 
 to have a smell of the wares and before the action was finished most people had been liberally sprayed on 
 the hands and arms with three or four different scents the atmosphere in the staff car was overpowering and regardless 
 of the rain most of the windows were open for the rest of the day that afternoon the groups proceeded

 the remainder stayed at the hotel britannique about a block away it was here that the regimental party committed a 
 grave error by sending out all its battledress for pressing at one time it took a fair amount of sorting 
 to match the trousers with the jackets for the writer this was comparatively easy as his trousers were given to 
 major kearns who swore up and down either his pants had been shrunk or he had grown overnight a great

 the patrician 126 on the 18th the groups visited the ppcli cemetery at voormezeele and then proceeded to vierstraat kemmel

 continued unabated and was not to let up until noon of the 20th in the afternoon following lunch at the

 had worked so hard for the fulfillment of this project and had been looking forward so much to this regimental

 difficult place to locate the following morning the party proceeded in individual groups to two locations in germany the rsms 
 party left in the kleinebus bound for the ist canadian guards they had the misfortune to be involved in an 
 accident in holland and except for being shaken up and bruised finally arrived at their destination in another vehicle about 
 2300 hours it appears that a dutch driver backed a truck across the highway and the canadian driver swinging off 
 the road to avoid him went down a steep incline the rsms claim that but for the quick thinking of 
 their driver who sustained a broken foot things would have been much different the remaining groups travelled to headquarters northag 
 located not too far from munchen gladbach that evening the group complete with the canadian officers serving at this headquarters

 various regimental problems we were delighted to hear that he was being released from hospital in a few days after 
 spending far more than the time allotted by the doctor with brigadier ware we proceeded to fort mcleod 
 the patrician 133 to lunch with lieutenant colonel h elliott and his officers of 1 queen s own rifles of 
 canada that evening we attended a cocktail party at hilltop house the residence of brigadier and mrs ware and were 
 very pleased to re acquaint ourselves with so many friends of long standing later in the evening the regimental officers

 lieutenant colonel and mrs mulherins residence to say goodbye and thank them for their wonderful hospitality the group then made 
 their way to fort st anne the home of the ist black watch royal highland regiment where we had been 
 invited for lunch major d doidge and his officers were most kind and it was rather difficult to leave the 
 rsms party was similarly taken care of by the warrant officers and senior ncos a short stop was made at 
 the holiday shop in soest for some last minute shopping before proceeding to cologne we arrived there about 1700 hours 
 in the midst of the rush hour traffic and it was an eye opener to see such heavy traffic we 
 eventually found our hotel the furstenhof am dam located nearly opposite the very famous cologne cathedral this magnificent structure dates 
 back to the 14th century and it is a credit to the marksmanship of the allied forces during world war 
 ii that it was left comparatively undamaged the morning of the 25th heralded another overcast drizzly day we were awakened 
 very early by the noise of vehicles and trams about 1100 hours the rsms party departed for marville followed about 
 an hour later by the regimental officers party this was the last we were to see of this group until 
 the morning of the 28th a long very scenic drive along the rhine and moselle rivers ensued punctuated by brief 
 stops for food and refreshments both parties arrived in marville about 2200 hours the following morning we were advised by 
 our driver that the rsms party were no sooner in bed than they were aroused and told to get dressed 
 and packed they left by north star freighter about 0200 hours on the 26th via shannon ireland lajes in the 
 azores and gander arriving in trenton about 2300 hours the 27th the regimental officers spent the morning of 26th at 
 the rcaf px shopping and then endeavouring to pack everything in already overcrowded 0:over 0:crowded bags they left marville about 
 1400 hours aboard a cf 106 yukon and enjoyed a comfortable fast trip back to canada arriving in ottawa about 
 2300 hours transferring to a cosmopolitan for the onward flight to trenton the next afternoon a further regimental executive committee 
 meeting was held tying up all the points that 
 the patrician 134 had been previously discussed the next morning the regimental party was split up with the group proceeding 
 to victoria leaving by cosmopolitan 0:cosmo 0:politan aircraft while the group proceeding to edmonton went by cll9 aircraft it is 
 assumed that both groups arrived at their homes about the same time so ended a memorable and never to be 
 forgotten trip all ranks who attended the battlefield tour dedication ceremonies and subsequent trip to germany are grateful for the

 the patrician 135 i s army ranger course by lt tk crichton a summary of the ranger course conducted by 
 the us ranger department at fort benning georgia myself and two other canadians both sgts were nominated to attend the 
 ranger course class no 7 commencing sth february 59 and ending 08 april 59 at fort benning ga the purpose 
 of the course and the us ranger department is to develop to the maximum the command and leadership potential of 
 selected officers and ncos of the us army the ranger department intends by this to improve the leadership and training 
 capabilities of all units the ultimate aim of the department 0:depart 0:ment is to have one ranger qualified officer in 
 each company and one ranger qualified nco in each platoon these officers and ncos can then advise and assist their 
 commanding officer in the training of their units they can also train their own sub units in the techniques and 
 skills learned on the ranger course the department does not produce cloak and dagger experts or the old blood and 
 guts type commando the course trains the leaders of small units of the fighting arms in the ranger techniques these 
 leaders once qualified as rangers also assist the unit commander in training his subordinate commanders in leadership command and other 
 subject scope the length of the course is eight weeks or a total of approximately 650 hours for both the 
 officers and ncos because the course is both exacting and demanding physically and mentally these students are us army volunteers 
 however newly commissioned 0:com 0:missioned regular army second lieutenants of any of the fighting arms are required to complete either 
 airborne or ranger training the ranger course develops leadership and builds self confidence and lets the officer or nco know 
 where his weaknesses and strengths lie the emphasis is on practical realistic and somewhat hazardous field work with a minimum 
 of formal type classroom instruction there is only one written examination and this is on map reading during the first 
 week of the course canadian students had little difficulty with this as it is very basic the real tests begin 
 when the student finds himself in command of a patrol each patrol has a ranger qualified instructor with war experience 
 observing the activities of the patrol he is introduced into each patrol as a battalion observer who will report to 
 the commandant on your conduct 
 the patrician 136 during the conduct of the patrol the observer never interferes with the handling except where there is 
 a danger of someone being seriously hurt the patrol leader is allowed to make all his mistakes to realize them 
 and to sometimes correct them the success of the patrol is in his hands the ranger instructor watches the actions 
 of the various members of the patrol and when he deems necessary kills off or wounds the patrol leader thereby 
 causing a new chain of command to take oyer the observer always has a list of students who are to 
 be assessed during the patrol to ensure that all members are kept alert anyone could at any time be called 
 up as patrol leader and many others receive satisfactory 0:satis 0:factory or unsatisfactory spot reports on their part as either 
 team leaders or wireless operators etc no member of the patrol except the patrol leader knows when he is being 
 assessed at the completion of the patrol the observer rates the student s demonstration of his leadership qualities in handling 
 many problems to build up proper atmosphere during their first two weeks the students are weakened mentally and physically to 
 set the stage for war on both the southern front florida and the northern front blue mountains each student is 
 allowed from 2i 2 to 3 hours sleep in each 24 hrs the ranger instructor upon completion 0:com 0:pletion of 
 the patrol also conducts a critique of the action the students therefore not only learn by doing but also by 
 discussing the patrol actions in a critique the patrols themselves which constitute the major part of the students activity may 
 vary in size from a reconnaissance patrol of 5 to 8 men to a company raid of about 120 men

 the patrician 137 command is taken from the students patrol distances vary from 2 miles to 50 miles oyer terrain 
 which seems at the time to be impassable prior to operating in both swamps and mountains training is given in 
 helicopters 0:heli 0:copters light aircraft otter and ll9 type minesweepers rubber assault craft building rope bridges and rope techniques to 
 include rappelling and cliff climbing the situations which occur are realistic ones and the enemy parts are played by a 
 permanent aggressor force who add colour and realism to the training this lifts the student from a course situation to 
 that of actual warfare less live ammunition patrols are never postponed because of inclement weather saturdays sundays or holidays command 
 within the patrol is rotated among the members so that all have the opportunity to lead and command buddy systems 
 are introduced early as this tends to promote teamwork on its most basic level the patrols are physically and mentally 
 tiring requiring maximum effort on a minimum of rest admitting to fatigue or hunger is no excuse for poor work 
 during these times of fatigue and strain the training manifests itself by the ranger esprit de corps the fervent desire 
 to accomplish the mission it is during these times that students with high leadership qualities stand out as men who 
 can still get on with the job and successfully lead their men despite all hardships all ranks of the regiment 
 were pleased when ssgt shine rc cd was named honour graduate of the us army ranger course at fort benning 
 georgia which concluded in nov of this year us army photograph 
 the patrician 138 fort benning phase on arrival at fort benning the ranger department issues the student one half of 
 the ranger arc tab 1 and tells him that that is all he will be given on the course the 
 rest he must work for within the first two days the student is subjected to a physical fitness and swimming 
 0:swim 0:ming test which he must pass in order to commence ranger training to give the department some idea of 
 where the weaknesses lie in the students in the days that follow he progresses from a one mile run to 
 five miles and then to a two mile run with battle order and weapon the pace in all cases is 
 fast and quickly eliminates many students from the course in these first two weeks the student is taught those subjects 
 which are needed for the field training which follows through past experience it has been determined that most students needed 
 a review in map reading 0:read 0:ing patrol orders warning orders battle procedure and wireless procedure 0:pro 0:cedure it was 
 also found that the average student needed an extensive course in physical conditioning prior to his arduous work in the 
 camps the student receives this conditioning in physical training classes by running obstacle courses confidence tests and hand to hand

 the patrician 139 and bayonet training each student benefits since his physical condition is improved and as he concurrently learns 
 additional skills also included in his training at fort benning are courses in demolitions using live charges this skill is 
 used in all raid type patrols map and air photo reading battle procedure intelligence procedures helicopter loading drills and the 
 use of aircraft for aerial resupply there is also instruction in bayonet disarming patrolling techniques patrol orders and reports handling 
 of prisoners of war cliff assault techniques artillery support of patrol operations and communications even during this garrison phase the 
 emphasis is on student participation 0:participa 0:tion the map test includes a compass course by buddy teams of approximately 0:approxi 
 0:mately 9 to 10 miles in length the student is required to complete the course in ten hours not only 
 does he apply his knowledge of map reading in field tests but he also benefits from the experience of moving 
 over difficult terrain during the hours of darkness his self confidence is thereby increased as his knowledge of this basic 
 subject is improved his mental attitude is improved and he is mentally made much keener in the first two weeks 
 the keynote is mental and physical preparation 0:prepara 0:tion for war and the candidate is shown that the only way 
 he can succeed is through hard work there is no room on the course for a man who needs another 
 man as a crutch through constant harassment and pushups the student is brought to a state of mental and physical 
 fatigue he is now ready for the southern front and his first engagement 0:engage 0:ment with the enemy the amphibious 
 and jungle training phase the second phase of training takes place at the florida encampment this is located approximately 240 
 miles south of fort benning on the elgin air force base reservation there the ground is ideal for the type 
 of training intended the terrain approximately 192 000 acres is generously flat and covered in the high places with slash 
 pine and scrub oak the few open areas are surrounded by swamps streams and rivers in some areas the vegetation 
 is not unlike that found in the malayan and phillipine jungles the area abounds in wildlife including reptiles which are 
 of both the poisonous and non poisonous species during the initial stages in florida the students are formed as a 
 company of the 2nd ranger battalion which is given the task of providing the patrolling and raiding parties for the 
 rest of the division before you are committed to battle you are taught certain techniques which must be mastered before 
 you can successfully operate in the swamp some of these techniques are the one and two rope bridges for river 
 crossings helicopter lifting demolitions survival training and swamp navigation upon completion of this training you are committed to battle as 
 patrols against aggressors with very little time between patrols and very little time for preparation all this is designed to 
 get the students mind thinking that he is in action instead of attending a course 
 the patrician 140 this phase of the course is devoted to both day and night patrolling problems in a realistic 
 setting the majority of the exercises however are conducted at night there are combat or fighting patrols ambushes waterborne raids 
 beach landings from lcms and minesweepers otter aircraft landings behind enemy lines and helicopter supported operations entailing resupply and the 
 evacuation of wounded cross country navigation 0:naviga 0:tion by day and night using both map and compass requires the utmost 
 in precision and accuracy if the small enemy positions are to be located in the dense terrain where visibility is 
 less than 20 yards in one of the problems small boats have to be acquired from a partisan by night 
 after a long march movement downstream with the small craft over a long distance on a deep fast moving river 
 requires navigation by dead reckoning one error at any point throughout the exercise can result in the patrol being delayed 
 and the ultimate failure of the mission in addition to the test in navigation there is always the aggressor soldier 
 to harass the patrol strategically emplaced he tests the ranger s ability to cope with the many and varied situations 
 which are usually found only in actual combat capture by the aggressor only happens once for the treatment given to 
 the ranger is such that he will pass along terrible stories which tend to keep the others always on their 
 guard the large aggressor force is well trained and is equipped with uniforms and identification cards similar to those that 
 would be found on an aggressor all add a great deal of realism to the scene a ci cu c

 the patrician 141 weapons and equipment are carried but rations are limited this necessitates a pioneer knowledge of how to 
 live off the land and water survival and field expedients become part of the ranger s training he learns to 
 eat palmettos and how to build traps and snares he learns that a rattle snake or alligator when properly cooked 
 can become a tasty meal one of the most unique methods of building the students selfconfidence 0:self 0:confidence can be 
 found in the florida camp one would not hesitate to walk a narrow board on the ground but place the 
 same plank thirty feet above swamp water and somehow there is a difference this difference of course is the individual 
 s mind after walking a log for about 25 feet the student then climbs a swaying rope to another rope 
 which stretches back across the water from a height of forty feet he then drops into the water and swims 
 to shore all to the accompaniment of exploding charges of tnt the ranger learns that he can do more than 
 he ever thought humanly possible two of the many company type raids used in the florida phase are as follows 
 the students are formed as a company which will be landed by otter aircraft behind enemy lines at night using 
 pathfinders for aircraft guidance a move across country of 1000 yards to a prisoner of war compound where a rescue 
 is effected to secure a friendly officer held prisoner using live demolitions to gain entrance to the compound and a 
 hasty withdrawal under pressure to the aircraft pick up site and a return to base if the raiding party is 
 unable to return in time the aircraft will leave thereby causing the company to return on foot using stealth to 
 infiltrate the enemy lines the second raid is an airforce supported company strength raid to destroy a missile site on 
 an island in the gulf of mexico live demolitions 0:demoli 0:tions are used and a withdrawal by rubber assault craft 
 made to a minesweeper about 900 yards off shore after returning to fort benning for a one day administrative stop 
 over the student then moves on to the mountains of north georgia for the last phase of his training the 
 mountain training phase the ranger mountain training camp is located 14 miles from dahlonega georgia and 215 miles north of 
 fort benning here in the great chattahoochee national forest he finds ground of a very different type from that found 
 in florida it is heavily wooded with slash pine hemlock and scrub oak and is thick with vegetation here for 
 approximately 0:approxi 0:mately 17 days the student is involved in mountain training and its many ramificatoins before committing the ranger 
 to battle the local headquarters ranger dept teaches him the techniques that he will require to successfully operate in the 
 mountains the student first learns the fundamentals of rope work which includes knots and lashings he then progresses to one 
 two and three rope bridges free and balanced 
 the patrician 142 climbing tension climbing and cliff scaling using team play and other methods used by swiss mountain climbers 
 also included are rappelling methods of cliff evacuation and resupply he is also taught to cross swift streams using many 
 expedients found useful on the cold mountain slopes once fully oriented and trained the ranger company is then committed 0:com 
 0:mitted to battle against the aggressor again the patrol is the vehicle of instruction day and night patrols surge forward 
 with aggressors tactically located to interrupt the advance constant patrolling with short notice and under simulated wartime conditions teaches the 
 patrol leader to make hasty decisions under conditions he would normally consider impossible this coupled with a lack of sleep 
 and food put the student through conditions considered rough even for war patrols in the mountains 0:moun 0:tains range from 
 recce patrols seeking information to company raids aimed at destroying the generators of a power plant a distance of 50 
 miles away over very rough country on this last a move is made from a landing zone to a clandestine 
 bivouac area where a partisan is contacted who will provide a minimum of food and information from here the second 
 leg of the journey is to the deep blue ridge lake which entails firstly a river crossing under fire then 
 a meeting with a second partisan who provides the patrol with live chickens which must be killed and prepared under 
 the constant threat of enemy contact the last leg of the journey is a lake crossing using assault boats to 
 destroy two out of three generators of the blue ridge power dam this is followed by a helicopter pick up 
 one mile from the dam at first light next morning it usually requires a minimum of two days and three 
 nights to make the cross country move ranger instructors accompany all the patrols just as is done in the florida 
 camp they offer no suggestions or make no comments until the critique at the conclusion of the patrol the mountain 
 camp has its method of building confidence as does the florida camp here the student is required to climb a 
 swaying rope ladder for about 100 feet hook a block to a steel cable which stretches across a lake ride 
 down the cable at break neck speed and drop into the water on the signal from an instructor at the 
 other end of the cable the death slide as it is called is a challenge and at first appears frightening 
 0:frighten 0:ing but once mastered it becomes a vivid reminder to the student that he can do the seemingly impossible 
 the successful completion of this difficult course is a remarkable accomplishment for any officer or non commissioned officer when upon 
 graduation he receives the coveted ranger arc tab he is indeed a proud man and a better soldier he is 
 a living fulfillment of the ranger department s mission he is equipped with the knowledge needed to conduct this type 
 of training in his own unit he is a soldier indoctrinated with ranger drive toughness and spirit and is confident 
 in his ability to operate effectively under conditions of extreme physical and mental stress and therefore an asset to the 
 canadian or any other army
