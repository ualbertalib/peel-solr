 blood reserve between cardston and standoff must be impressed by the vastness of the land allotted to this branch of
 the blackfoot nation a total of 541 square miles in size the blood reserve is the largest in canada and
 provides a home for some 2 1 10 indians it contains some of the finest ranching land in southern alberta
 and also has proven to he excellent for wheat oats and other grains the blood reserve was officially given to
 the tribe on march 20 1885 although the first families were settled there on sept 29 1 880 the first
 government building a home and storehouse for john macdougall the farm instructor was built in the fall of 1 880
 near the old whiskey post of slide out and by the end of the year the bloods had built 45
 crude dwellings of poplar logs when the bloods signed treaty no seven in 1877 they had agreed to take up
 their reserve in the arid desolate region bordering the bow river at the time of the treaty buffalo were still
 plentiful and the bloods gave little thought to abandoning their nomadic life for a drab existence as farmers however by
 1 880 when the buffalo herds were quickly diminishing and starvation was lurking about the camps the chiefs decided their
 original reserve would he a poor place to settle the decision of the chiefs was passed on to the indian
 commissioner edgar dewdney who arrived at fort macleod in september of 1 880 the first move by the commissioner was
 to obtain a release from the blood head chief red crow which stated in part i mekasto or red crow
 head chief of the blood indians on behalf and with the consent of the blood indians include in said treaty
 do hereby give up all our rights titles and privileges whatsoever to the lands included in said treaty provided the
 government ‘ will grant us a reserve on the belly river in the neighbourhood of the mcuth of the kootenai
 waterton river after he obtained a release the commissioner made the following report on arriving at fort macleod i found
 a large portion of the blood indians awaiting my arrival for the purpose of hearing what determination the government had
 come to in regard to that matter i informed the blood chief that if he would give me a release
 of all his interest in the reserve situated at the blackfoot crossing provided the government would give him a reserve
 at the point he indicated i would send an instructor with him and his band to the spot selected by
 himself where he could build houses and prepare some ground for next seasonand that i would recommend on my arrival
 red crow head chief of the bloods provided sound leadership for his people through treaty negotiations and the early years

 at the time of preparing this paper he was with the dept of economic affairs alberta government the a ticl
 originally appeared in alberta historical review vol 1 no 3 in november 1953 below that a reserve be given to
 him at serve and built rough log houses to replace that point this greatly pleased the chief their worn lodges
 by the end of that first and his indians who were with him lean year 20 acres of land had
 been broken at this time only about 800 bloods were and the indians were kept occupied through encamped around fort
 macleod receiving the winter cutting fence rails the threat of daily rations the remainder were still in starvation was eased
 by the daily rations of montana attempting to eke out an existence beef and flour ranging from half a pound
 by following the diminishing buffalo herds to a pound per day depending upon the supply on hand the commissioner was
 true to his promise and on sept 29 th norman macleod in the spring of 1881 the remainder of the
 agent for treaty seven together with the bloods returned from montana bring john macdougall the farm instructor tra ing starvation
 and measles with them they veiled with the bloods to the site of their had been robbed of their buffalo
 robes by new reserve whiskey traders in the vicinity of fort benton and straggled into their home camps i went
 to the forks of the kootenai and belly rivers stated the agent where i with little more than their horses
 and the found a large bottom the upper portion clothes they wore the number of bloods of which is occupied
 by mr fredrick on the reserve increased from 800 to 3 300 wachter s ranche and below his a man
 within a few weeks and any progress made of the name of murray has a small ranche the remaining portion
 of the bottom is in seeding the broken land with turnips and chiefly gravel and sand with very little potatoes
 was soon disrupted fences were soil and had been all overflowed during pulled down for firewood and seed was dug
 the high waters in summer there is no up for food by the new arrivals quantity of building timber available
 this is the bottom which red crow desired to settle upon but i considered it unfit however by 1 882
 most of the bloods for a location below the mouth of the had accepted their new life and made the
 kootenai river eastwards and along the best of it the bands spread out along the north side of the belly
 river a high bank river from the present town of glenwood runs for several miles to the vicinity of where
 the fish eaters band camped to the slideout leaving little room between it and the river except at one point
 where northernmost point near slide out where there is a large gravelly bottom cut up the all short people band
 settled by sloughs the country along the top of this bank is gravel and stones there is no survey of
 the reserve was made until some good timber on this side i then the autumn of i 882 previous to
 this survey crossed the belly river to the south side an irate rancher in the standoff district and from the
 mouth of the kootenai eastwards and extending from the river to the penned an indignant letter to the fort macfoot
 of the belly buttes there are large leod gazette entitled where is the blood level stretches of good clay soil
 with a reservation the letter was dated july 8 large quantity of building and fence tim 1 882 and was
 signed grumbler no i ber at the upper end opposite the kootenai this i decided upon as being the where
 is the blood reservation it best location in that part of the country began i have been trying to find
 out for the past two years but can find no one to at this period the bloods who had re
 enlighten me at the treaty at the blackmained in canada were in a pitiful state foot crossing in 1877 the
 bloods were as they are entirely dependent upon the signed a reservation adjoining the blackfeet or at all events in
 that locality in food they may receive from the govern the fall of 1880 mr n macleod the inment stated
 the agent they have noth dian agent mr john macdougall farm ing except their horses and they will sooner instructor
 and red crow chief of the starve than part with them they have no bloods picked on the river bottom
 below clothing their lodges are worn to rags and standoff on the belly river as a fit and proper place
 which seemed satisfactory they are consequently drenched by every to all concerned at the time after a year s passing
 shower they cannot even procure trial they found it was better adapted to a pinch of salt to season their
 small ration of raise bricks than vegetables after a big flour and beef with there is no game of outlay
 at government expense any kind to be got in sufficient quantity last year ‘ 81 they the bloods went en

 immediately after the to find this mound would be an indicastorm the weather turned exceedingly tion that something was wrong
 and in fine the chinook winds cleared off the that event the indians would probably snow and in a few
 days the roads were return home after setting up a theodolite in a good condition for travel at the mound
 preceding the missing one and chaining a mile along a picket line the location of the reserve appeared satis the
 mound was found buried in long factory to red crow and his band until grass with the post lying beside

 the mormon colony up to the mountains reported surveyor white calf had drawn my attention to nelson and that he
 thought this territory some poplar saplings which had been had perhaps been given him he said cut and taken off
 the reserve apparently that jerry potts who acted as interpre by the settlers i counted the stumps and ter did
 not translate correctly but here sent for mr card the head man of the i was able to correct him
 for i was pres community who upon being told what ent at the treaty and heard potts tell had been
 done apologized to the indians him that the south boundary of the re for one of his people having unwittingly

 had tied the claim no idea of an artificial boundary such as a line of mounds their method of de
 the bloods continued to cluster around fining a tract of land being by means of the belly river between slideout
 and standnatural boundaries such as rivers lakes and mountains and they seemed to be off for the next several years
 and no atunable to understand any other tempt was made to move onto the prairie land most families were content
 to live in surrounding them was quickly being taken the river bottoms and raise small garden up by settlers the
 land around cardston crops this was all changed in the early where a handful of mormons had settled in nineties
 by two far reaching moves 1887 was soon crowded with the utah the first factor was the subdivision of the
 group because the southern part of the reserve was vacant many settlers bordering agricultural land along the belly river the
 the southern boundary began to herd cattle township lines which had ended at the re on indian land any protest
 by the agent serve boundaries were extended and the was answered with the cry that the southern townships along the
 belly river were sub boundary was unfenced and the cattle just divided into 80 acre plots this tended to wandered
 in break up the irregular garden patches held by the bloods and encouraged a larger scale this trouble between the
 mormons and of farming activities by the more ambitious the agent become more heated in the spring individuals of 1899
 when the government announced that the southern line would be fenced af the second a perhaps more significant tcr hearing
 several rumors the agent wrote factor was the introduction of ranching to to the north west mounted police in fort

 who used their horses as a medium of cx the indian department is building a change the success of this
 pair soon en barb wire fence along the southern boundary couraged others to take up cattle and within of this
 reserve he stated and as some a few years the cattle industry had become of the settlers who have been
 grazing their an important source of income the need cattle upon the reserve for years are not too for grass
 soon encouraged the bloods to well satisfied i am much afraid the fence take their cattle onto the prairie land
 where may be cut his fears were quickly realized good hay crops provided feed for the stock it also encouraged
 individuals to spread out great pressures were placed upon the from their home camps as more land was bloods to
 surrender parts of their reserve needed for corrals and buildings to land hungry settlers here a govern as this gradual
 movement of the bloods ment representative explains a land surtook place within their reserve the land render proposition to the

 southern alberta the blackfoot east of in the year that followed the refusal of calgary were induced to sell a
 large portion the sale the government compromised by of their reserve consisting of some 115 000 leasing portions of the
 reserve to white acres and in 1909 the peigans near pincher ranchers for short term periods during this creek sold
 another block to land hungry time there were numerous petitions and resettlers but the bloods with their 353 448 quests
 that the unused portions of the acres remained aloof in the face of political blood reserve be taken away from
 the inpressure from all sides and the pleas from dians with the bloods receiving compentheir agent to give up a
 part of their re sation and turned over to white farmers serve however the government remained true to the government
 finally brought matters the treaty and left the reserve in the hands to a head in 1907 by ordering that
 a vote be of the bloods taken among the male members of the tribe over 21 years of age in

 houses were made of hewn spruce ing a leakproof room the outer bark was logs mostly we had only two
 windows in laid outside the inside roof was therefore them no upper floors no glass but a raw smooth and
 glossy hide skin of a deer or moose calf was used as there were no stoves open fire places only
 the hair would be taken off it was put were built in either corner from the door on the window
 while wet and nailed on with we called these mud stoves they were wooden pegs on slats around the window
 made of poles mud and hay mixed and more mud and water making a smooth fin when dry it would
 be taut and might be ish white clay was then mixed in water and used as a drum it was
 not transparent but rubbed all over with a cloth when dry gave light though not as good as glass this
 was white usually two iron bars were it had one advantage no peeping tom was hung about four feet from
 the floor these going to peep through your window there bars were used to hang kettles on we got fore
 window blinds were unnecessary these bars from the h b store and also from old discarded guns about a foot
 away from we had saws about eight feet long the mud stove the floor was plastered down they looked like
 ice saws with handles at solid a precaution taken so sparks would each end a platform was built about ten
 feet above the ground a log would be not ignite and burn the house the open chimney was built about
 two feet above the hoisted up and a man on top would pull roof so the sparks would not drop
 on the the saw up the man below would pull the roof on a windy night sparks could be saw
 down sawing the log on the downward seen coming out thick but the chimney bestroke lots of floors were made
 of hewed ing high they would drop on the ground logs placed tightly together even doors harmlessly the house was
 then chinked were made of hewn logs all the tools were plastered with clay white mud washed a supplied by
 the h b co store rafters were cellar door was made in the floor and the made of poles about
 three feet apart most house was ready to move into of the roofs were one quarter pitch then the builder
 would go into the forest to get but before the house had been occupied bark from the spruce trees the
 bark being two days the owner had to invite the neightaken off the tree during sapping time the bours to
 a big dance we danced reels length of the bark would be six feet or so jigs and other old
 time dances we had and the width vary according to the size of no tables because we didn t have
 them we the tree this bark after it was taken off didn t miss them no chairs or benches we
 the tree would be set flat on rails above the ate on the floor a canvas was spread with ground
 to dry 1 may say now that the very a white cloth on top then the set was best of
 timber was within a mile from the ready for the meal we had a three corner settlements for there were
 no loose fires in cupboard in a corner for our dishes a cloth those days to destroy and mar nature
 s pie was hung over for lumber was scarce and ture when the bark was dry in the fall it
 hard to make we got strap hinges and was then laid on the rafters lapping on top latches from the
 posts others had wooden like shingles the bark was then pinned latches and wooden hinges a hole was bordown with
 long poles crosswise from the ed in a slab or board and another slab with roof holes were bored in
 the pole and pins a tongue in the end would serve as a hinge made of wood were driven tight
 thus mak they were very squeaky our pots and mrs annie victoria callihoo nee belcourt 1860 1966 was born in

 this article originally appeared in alberta historical review vol 1 no 3 in november 1953 this view of a metis
 house in 1814 was made by artist henri julien during the warm weather the cooking often was done outside dishes
 were from the h b co the pots fitted this with which we pounded the barwere made of copper and
 they were seam ley in the hole for about twenty minutes lii less we had eight gallons to two pint
 pots that time the hulls would be all off the grain they were very useful and stood rough we separated
 the hulls from the grain and usage when a pot was bumped it was easy used the grain for soup
 which was wholeto hammer it back to its proper shape some and delicious when the grain was very dry we
 put it in a frying pan adding a there were no beds everyone slept on the little grease and when
 cooked brown it was floor all bedding was gathered folded and a good substitute for bread we had no cofplaced
 in one corner of the house in the fee but again barley came to the rescue day time big pieces
 of slab wood would be we put the barley in the frying pan without placed standing up perpendicular ofl hulling
 it and when it was fried real black the mud stove usually coals of fire would we used that for
 coffee we had tea and still be burning in the morning the fire block sugar like we had during the
 war in from the mud stove would give a glow the cafes providing both heat and light we had no
 lamps nor candles so after a few years we though the buffalo had now gone we made our own candles
 our bedding consist raised cattle hogs and chickens food was ed of duck and goose feathers for mattresses still plentiful
 as moose deer and bear were and pillows and buffalo robes and h b plentiful we then turned to these
 animals co four point blankets for food and clothing moose hide when tanned made nice moccasins and coats we had
 no flour we grew a little barley pants mitts gloves and other articles but we cut a block of black
 poplar about 30 it never made a robe the hair came off inches high and 16 inches in diameter we
 too easily and the same with the deer we bored a hole about 6 8 inches deep and 7 began
 raising cattle and in the fall we inches across we would soak the barley butchered one or sometimes two to
 carry in lukewarm water for a while drain off the us through the winter some of the metis water and
 pour the barley into this block didn t care for beef at first but they soon we had a hammer
 like apparatus that just got over that we got thread from the h b co store ago a lot of
 these people went up to grande and we learned to make our own nets we prairie where trapping and hunting
 was had lots of fish we were never short of good food our clothing was from cloths brought in ve
 milked cows we made our own milk by the h b co our men never had underpans out of birch
 bark we used tiny long wear nor socks there weren t any roots which we got in the muskegs to
 sew but we had large overcoats from buffalo the pans and berry pots with we used skins and outer leggings
 were worn made spruce gum heated to close the seams and from h b co blankets these leggings leaks of
 the birch pans birch canoes were reached up to the waist a buckskin string made the same way they were
 very light was tied to the leggings and that tied to one s belt women also had no stockings like
 we barbecued fish fowl and large pieces the men they wrapped their feet with an of meat over the open
 fire or covered the oblong piece of flannel women had legbird feathers and all under hot coals of gings which
 were worn below the knee wood and this cooked wonderfully and you they were made of black velvet and were
 ate something that was never touched by beaded on the outside of the leg when we anyone potatoes were cooked
 the same way women did outside work or made trips in and had good flavour winter we wrapped our knees
 with flannel metis from lac ste anne and st albert lette women had no coats but wore shawls often visited
 each other that is once or twice our livestock consisted of horses cattle a year these two settlements were of
 the pigs and chickens all scrubs same people and they were related mostly there would be a man or a
 family from lac during the buffalo hunts some settlers la biche or slave lake who would come would go through
 to red river for supplies and live in the settlement the two settle that weren t available here they would
 ments were all catholic l hirondelle bel bring back plows garden tools and tubs court gledus plante laderoute and gau
 they would return in the fall and usually thier were of french descent letendres two families or more would come
 back with ancestor came from the beaver indians in them to settle out here these families came the peace river
 country around forty years in wagons whiskey would be brought in a centre established for roman catholic metis was at
 st albert mission northwest of fort edmonton this view of the mission buildings and a few metis cabins was made
 in 1811 from winnipeg and rum and brandy were was brought in by two men with two poles sold or
 bartered by the h b co these poles were shoved under the cock about two feet apart then the whole
 cock we had no soap but we made la potash would be lifted clean and brought to the from fats
 or grease with ashes lye we used stack round hay stacks were put up we it for our toilet and
 washing soap perhaps had no hay racks small racks were built on it was rather hard for the delicate skin
 but long runner sleighs a sort of stone box it was as good as any soap i have used oxen
 hauled the hay home in winter some of us still use ia potash to this day of course we had
 dog trains too for no brooms were to be had at the store faster trips one didn t care when
 one left we made them out of a certain kind of wil for a trip with dog team morning noon
 or low we chose the long taper kind these evening my husband left lac ste anne sticks were taken from
 the tops about two in the evening and arrived at edmonton hefeet long about 100 of these would be tied
 fore sunrise the following morning together around a four foot smooth stick this was the broom handle the stick was
 after the hunts were over some people driven into the centre of the tied willows went down to morley or
 man a chap panand our broom was ready for use nihh meaning where the bows were taken this is how
 bow river got its name moss was pulled up in the fall after hay which is wrong bow river in
 indian is ing little spruce trees were cut half way ask ka we see pee which means don tabout two
 feet from the ground the upper freeze over river this river was never part pushed down and we put our
 moss known to be frozen over all winter for on top of this sort of rack where it would ponies
 crossing it dry before winter set in it was hauled in as needed moss was a household necessity better and
 cheaper horses were later we raised our babies with it we stuffed it brought up from the blackfoot of the
 old in mess bags in which our babies were lac man s river ed up we did not use any
 diapers we also we bartered our furs at the h b co used moss to wipe floors after scrubbing them
 usually the company advanced a settler with credit after haying and on through we cultivated our land an acre or

 the gate and bastion are on the right side of thomas scott who was executed by order which had been
 reserved from the novof the rid provisional government on the ember term until the sitting of this court attorney general
 clarke asked for his 4 th of march 1870 was brought before lordship s judgment on the pleas to the
 mr justice betournay sitting as police jurisdiction of the court as he was not magistrate and gilbert mcmicken an oh
 in a position to decide what further steps jection to jurisdiction was overruled as be to take in the case
 until his lordship s decision had been given ing a matter for the higher court and after his lordship in
 that case i do not five days hearing lepine was committed for intend to give judgment until next term trial
 in november following he appeared i do not think myself competent or justibefcre the court of queen s bench mr
 fied in deciding a question of such importance without a full bench i will there justice mckeagney presiding hon mr
 fore await the appointment of a chief royal who appeared for the prisoner raised justice till next term and if
 at that time the question of jurisdiction to which at there is no chief justice appointed i will torney general
 clarke replied and judgment have the question re argued before mywas reserved on the 22 nd december 1873 self and
 my learned brother betournay and then decide the question mr justice mckeagney on the application attorney general pardon me my
 of mr royal opposed by the attorney gen lord surely your lordship will not refuse eral granted bail the prisoner
 in 4 000 to give a decision on a question so simple and two sureties in 2 000 each when
 the as that of your own jurisdiction as a judge case came on again on february 10 th the of
 the court four months have now elapsed since the question was argued before judge was unprepared to give judgment and
 you and there has been absolutely no a rather heated discussion took place be other business before you during all
 that tween him and the attorney general who time i do not think i am asking too much was also
 premier of the province as ap at your lordship s hands in praying for judgment so that the crown may
 proceed pears from the following report with the case this term of court opened on tues his lordship i don
 t think it would day feb 10 th 1874 mr justice mckeag be right in me to take upon myself
 to ney on the bench ambroise d lepine decide the question i will wait for the was in attendance awaiting
 the decision of appointment of a chief justice before dethe court as to its jurisdiction for the ciding the case
 or giving my opinion i hearing of the charge against him and do not think it would be right to
 do other 4 av 4 a 4 4 pm i 4 4 4 i f i ‘ v f i
 ‘ 4 4 ‘ f i i ‘ i r is i i i ‘ y y ‘ t wise
 one judge is not enough to decide a matter of such grave importance to the prisoner attorney general my lord
 i must in the interest of the administration of justice in this province call your attention to the statute by
 virtue of which your lordship now sits on that bench and remind you that the law declares that any one
 judge of this court has full power and jurisdiction to hear and determine all questions arising before the court and
 it is only in case of appeal from the decision of one judge that the full bench is appealed to
 now surely your lordship is not going to allow it to be understood that you will appeal from your own
 fears to the full bench and in reality shirk your duty and cast doubts on your own competency and the
 jurisdiction of the court of queen s bench of the province his lordship mr attorney general can t i do
 as i please in the matter attorney general no my lord most certainly not you cannot do just as you
 please judges can but hear questions arising before them and decide according to law and justice judges cannot shirk their
 duty no matter how unpleasant and repugnant to their feelings the performance of such duties may be if it were
 otherwise i fear from what experience i have had in this court that unpleasant duties would only too often be
 passed over and the ends of justice defeated i respectfully pray your lordship not to allow it to go to
 the world that you are not competent to decide your own jurisdiction it will strike a fatal blow at the
 foundation of our administration of justice it will be a fearful thing if the people of canada are allowed to
 think that the judges of our courts in this young province are incompetent or afraid to administer justice that life
 and property must depend on the decision of a court that cannot or will not decide after four months deliberation
 a question a very simple question raised to its jurisdiction his lordship i will do as i please i won
 t hear any more arguments on the subject i want my brother judge at least to hear the question argued
 before there is any decision given attorney general his lordship mr justice betournay has already heard the question argued there
 was nothing new in the argument before your lordship last term it was the very same argument read from mr
 grey s pamphlet that was urged before your brother judge on the application for the commitment of the prisoner lepine
 his lordship well i will not give any decision now i will wait till next term attorney general my lord
 once more i beg of you do not drag our administration of justice in the dust do not i pray
 you make this court the jeer ambroise lepine was the centre of a considerable legal dispute during a trial for
 his part in the red river uprising and the scoff of every man of sense in the dominion if your
 lordship wishes to play into the hands of any political party let us understand it at once and we will
 then know that your object is to gain time so that efforts may be made in another quarter for a
 pardon but do not let it go to the world that you do not know your own power of jurisdiction
 his lordship much excited i will not allow you mr attorney general to proceed any further what do you mean
 to insinuate i should like to know attorney general i do not insinuate anything my lord i think i speak
 plainly and try to be fully understood i am determined if the court will not or cannot perform its duty
 that i will not shrink from reminding the court of the fact and at the same time endeavor to perform
 my duty fully and fearlessly mr dubuc will you consent mr attorney general to the prisoner s bait being enlarged
 attorney general i will not consent to anything as the court cannot decide its own jurisdiction i will leave this
 man suspended like mahomet s coffin till there is a decision given the court must take the whole responsibility his
 lordship i think the bail may be enlarged i see no objection the counsel for lepine then moved that authority
 it was also shown that by the his recognizances be enlarged which canadian statute c 14 of 1871 it was
 prowas granted vided that the count known as the gen before the opening of the court on the eral court

 or in the termitted before rupert s land became part ritory which has now become the said proof manitoba or
 even of canada was argued vince again at some length at the conclusion of it was pointed out that the
 general the argument the chief justice after some court referred to was the court establishopening remarks said the case has
 now ed by the hudson s bay company under been ably argued on behalf of the prisoner the power conferred
 by its charter and and the crown and as i have no doubt as which had jurisdiction of the offence
 changto the judgment that should be given i do ed at the time of its committal which jurisnot think any
 good end can be gained by diction was transmitted to the manitoba delay and i have therefore decided to supreme
 court when established by the follow the argument by immediate judg manitoba statute under the authority of the ment b
 n a act and continued in that court when he then continued with a long opinion its name was changed
 to the count of which quite clearly was not extempore and queen s bench as it then was almost was
 not oral covering as it does four in the course of his judgment he states teen closely printed pages in
 the report he although the crown did not establish referred to the hudson s bay company char any courts yet
 it appears the hudson s ter and to the various statutes dealing with bay co by virtue of the powers

 again getting to be a nuisance about town if the cattlemen have to complain of a short calf crop the
 proprietors of that desirable stock called pigs cannot complain there are several families of pigs in town which are immense
 in their proportions and threaten to overrun the whole place where a pool or two of water are gathered together
 there are the pigs in the midst of it and nothing is more prominent about them than the smell this
 is the live smell the dead smell will begin when indignant house holders begin to pick them off in pure
 self protection as they did last year the proper place for pigs is on a ranche in the country but
 if it is considered absolutely necessary to keep them in town the owners should at least have consideration enough for
 their neighbors to keep them shut up it is a great wonder that a pestilence has not been bred long
