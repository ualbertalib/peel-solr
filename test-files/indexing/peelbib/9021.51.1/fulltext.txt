 beginnings of calgary the isaac s freeze letters 1883 84 edited by hugh dempsey introduction jn the early 1880 s 
 isaac sanford freeze a 35 year old storekeeper from anagance new brunswick heard about the opportunities that existed in the 
 canadian west deciding to see for himself he joined another local man howard g graves and in may 1883 set 
 out for the west both wanted to determine if they should establish businesses somewhere along the track of the new 
 canadian pacific railway line on their way they were joined by isaac g vanwart who became freeze s partner fui 
 ther along the route they were joined by methodist minister angus robertson and his brother william robertson making a party 
 of five freeze and vanwart examined several towns along the line until they reached medicine hat which was near the 
 end of the steel there the five hired a freighter to take them to calgary by this time freeze was 
 discouraged by the limited opportunities for a general merchant and perhaps wouldn t have bothered making the ten day trip 
 to calgary but as he commented as am so far i guess it is best to see the rockies and 
 then will be contented about the middle of june the party arrived in calgary where they found a bustling tent 
 and shack town on the east side of the elbow river freeze vanwart and graves seeing good prospects decided to 
 stay from the beginning of his trip freeze wrote regular letters home to his wife evelyn who was looking after 
 business at alberta history winter 2003 
 anagance in his absence with her were their two children dio and edna whom he called his dear pinks these 
 letters provide a graphic and personal view of the beginnings of 9 calgary from a tent town to the arrival 
 of the railway and settlement of the current downtown part of the city these letters preserved by granddaughter audrey pettigrew 
 are now in the glenbow archives m 6 141 they form only a small part of freeze s letters for 
 he wrote as many as twenty in a month the others apparently were never received or did not survive the 
 years and even among the ones printed here some are missing pages or are 4 damaged however there are enough 
 to reflect the optimism of the partners and the spirit of the town in its formative years very little editing 
 has been done to these letters in preparing them for publication a few personal comments have been removed articles added 
 and freeze s interminable dashes h have sometimes been replaced by periods for clarity other than that they are virtually 
 unchanged although not directly stated in these letters freeze and vanwart dissolved their partnership j in october of 1883 when 
 vanwart s family came to join him the separation was an amicable one vanwart took his son into business forming 
 vanwart son and occupied the place that he had shared with freeze freeze then built his own store and made 
 improvements over the winter he was among the first to buy a lot in the new townsite early in 1884 
 and moved his store across the elbow river at the beginning of march to a site on the present 9 
 th avenue between centre street and i st street east during this time freeze was caitying out plans for his 
 wife to sell off their assets and to come west in the spring of 1884 here is the story in 
 freeze s own words the letters have been divided into chapters with an introduction by the editor to place them 
 in perspective the editor alberta history winter 2003 u i i j ji n vi k z far left this 
 is a view of the tent town in calgary east of the elbow river in 1883 early in the following 
 year the whole town moved across the river to the present downtown area lef t an artist provided the impression 
 of a train s arrival in calgary it was published in 1886 above first page of a letter from isaac 
 freeze to his wife october 6 1883 
 one off to the vest when freeze left new brunswick the canadian pacific had not yet been completed he travelled 
 across canada to sarnia ontario then through the united states via chicago at st paul he went north to winnipeg 
 freeze with his four companions reached the end of the cpr construction ten miles east of medicine hat from that 
 point they walked virtually all the way to calgary as he later told a reporter they were only able to 
 make about 15 miles a day but as there were a couple of guns among the party they did some 
 shooting which helped to break the monotony of the journey calgary herald january 13 1921 he reached calgary on june

 hour there are a good many on from recruited before you go to work on your n b for the 
 west and we have had so far a dresses was in to see aunt jane in moncton very pleasant time 
 she thinks of going to montreal next month but says it will cost a good deal she is very love 
 and kisses for mamma and the pinks close papa h d gravesi and sam think they will never farm again 
 in nb after seeing what they port huron michigan have seen this far may 17 1883 7 am nothing special 
 to write i have not yet my dear wife we have just breakfasted as formed much of an opinion of 
 this country we cross river st clair from sarnia on the in my line love and kisses to mamma dio 
 canadian side to port huron on the side u s and edna you might write to pense to me this 
 is a charming country plenty of woods any time you wish interspersed through the low lands to make it beautiful 
 we will not know much about the from papa prairies until we get to chicago tomorrow morning am now looking 
 north on lake huron we crossed the river st clair on a pense station cr ry assiniboia boat that is 
 our whole train was run on the may 27 1883 4 pin boat and steamed across the river my dear 
 evelyn i wrote you a card last our provisions are holding out pretty well night but as today is sunday 
 and i am at bread is nearly done but have most all the leisure i thought best to write you 
 more fully sweets yet we are now just starting west about this country than i have hitherto done from port 
 huron here we see elevators and this part of the country is an immense plain all the signs of a 
 busy town slept from and on the horizon in a circle around the about 1 o clock last night until 
 this am station you can see about twenty shanties or about 6 have 9 cars of people on this train 
 tents these are situated from 1 to 3 miles n alberta history winter 2003 
 have not seen sam and chris since last monday but i feel assured they are much taken with the country 
 and will settle here that is at woolsley which i think is a fine agricultural field wages are low so 
 many laboring men coming in mr stewart is here and likes it he is getting 1 50 per day i 
 would like to see you and the little ones to get some kisses hope you are getting along nicely i 
 expect to go to regina tomorrow and the next day to moose jaw the track is now completed to medicine 
 hat or leopold which is the proper name there is so much i ought to write that i can t 
 think of it kisses for the pinks and dear mamma from her loving husband is freeze swift current c pr 
 north west territol may 31 1883 my dear wife we arrived here last evening at 4 30 p m and 
 found the rest of our party camped here we bought two buffalos and put them under us we passed a 
 vely comfortable night last night it is quite cold this morning we leave for maple creek and medicine hat this 
 am we are all well have lots of bed coverings so will be warm have a chance to mail letters 
 here so thought would let you know we were in good health at this point now 510 miles west of 
 winnipeg from the track the reason they are so far away is that there is a reserve of one mile 
 on each side of the track beyond these shanties the land is all taken up for miles back the soil 
 is heavy but when broken and subject to the action of the frost it becomes fine like powder and is 
 pronounced to be very fine wheat growing soil there is now at this station a steam plough which will plough 
 one hundred acres in twentyfour hours with appliances of this kind it wolild not take long to break up a 
 good portion of the north west there is one small store here at pense something like hope s in anagance 
 but there is no doubt that in a few years pense will be quite a village and maintain quite a 
 few stores it is astonishing to see the small towns that have arisen between winnipeg and moose jaw but at 
 all the main centres there is so much competition that i think the margins for many of them will be 
 small in my opinion the chances for speculation and trade are not much better than they are in n b 
 my reasons are because there are so many and so much capital coming into the country and everyone or most 
 everyone who wants an easy living are dabbling in trade of course 1 think a few years will wipe many 
 of them out as they do not manage their affairs on strict business principles and you could not expect them 
 so to do as they do not understand it will hallett is soon to be married so the ladies inform 
 me to a school teacher he has a station of his own now the weather here is beautiful and it 
 doesn t get dark until nearly 10 o clock mr lewis says that in a month or so it will 
 be twilight most all night it is certain that this great northwest is to be filled up with settlers and 
 every farmer with whom i met is pleased with the country and they have unbounded faith in its success most 
 everyone we see is from ontario the counties of huron and bruce are very largely represented travel to western canada 
 by colonist car was the most inexpensive way to go this illustration shows a typical colonist car used by canadian 
 pacific alberta history winter 2003 
 will be brought down here in steamers or barges this will be the main town in the west if the 
 coal is plenty and iron is to be had tis said there is plenty of iron 16 miles from here 
 the soil is very light on this side of the river south side but is said to be better on 
 the north side or west side there are a few trees along the river all poplars i would like to 
 live here in a few years as i have no doubt it will be a large city we have engaged 
 a mormon to freight us and luggage to calgary for 75 00 so this and grub will cost me about 
 15 00 for the trip everything is high here and everyone trying to get the best of you but our 
 party have got along well so far we will probably not leave here until monday morning and will arrive in 
 calgary in 9 or 10 days i don t imagine i will strike anything in this country every branch of 
 business is overdone and people here live more by their wits than by hard labor i could go back to 
 some of the smaller stations and run a small business and make a little but as am so far i 
 guess it is best to see the rockies and then will be contented this nw country is a bubble to 
 a large extent but there will be a great deal of business done in a few years as country is 
 filling in and people will stay i see lots of ponies and mules they are much used in this country 
 and are very hardy our ontario friends will buy here a pony or two they have two buckboards have just 
 had dinner and have concluded to cross the river this afternoon as there are a great many teams crossing on 
 the ferry most all the time so if we should wait here until monday we might not get across for 
 a good many more hours we will pitch our tents on the west side of the stream there is no 
 game here to speak of as the lakes are scarce we see but very few white ladies in this country 
 medicine hat saturday june 2 nd 1883 noon my dear wife i wrote you last from swift current about 140 
 miles east of this point we left there about 7 p m thursday had nothing but a caboose to ride 
 in and it was crowded so we had an uncomfortable night not getting any sleep this train brought us to 
 13 th siding about 40 miles east of medicine hat we waited there for a few hours and got on 
 a construction train placing our luggage in a car that had some horses in it we mounted up on top 
 of the box cars and rode to within 10 miles of medicine hat there we hired a freighter to drive 
 us and luggage to the river saskatchewan for 6 00 we arrived here at about 9 p m yesterday and 
 pitched our tents in the town site of medicine hat slept splendidly last night and feel much refreshed today i 
 eat pork gravy etc now and have no signs of dyspepsia there is something romantic in this kind of life 
 yet i think i would prefer a more civilized way of getting along i am writing on my knee in 
 tent and have a book under the paper the river saskatchewan here is about 300 yards wide and is a 
 very beautiful stream with high banks and hills 50 to 60 feet high the town site is a flat about 
 30 feet above the water now the railway crosses the river here and they have the bridge nearly ready for 
 crossing there is plenty of coal 6 miles up this river which this photograph of medicine hat as a tent 
 town was taken in june 1883 this is the same month that freeze and his party visited there while on 
 their way to calgary 
 the wind is beginning to blow quite heavy will then be splendid how are my treasures so will have to 
 tighten up tent some there and darling wife getting on i send you all a was a large tent store 
 here blown down a few lot of kisses and love don t fret about us days ago we are getting

 hotels we board ourselves quite 65 mi es northwest of medicine hat on line cheaply have canned plums and plum 
 jam of c p r wednesda y june 6 1883 lobster etc dear wife have arrived so far in good 
 i would like to drop in and spend the health and safety water is very bad such as afternoon with 
 you i had a great notion to we have at home in our frog ponds have end my trip here 
 and go back but have not seen a tree since we left medicine hat concluded to go on as it 
 won t cost me over 30 00 to go out and back again to here a good deal of this 
 land is good but the want of wood and water would be serious drawback to the settlement of this section 
 of there are some very fine farm lands in this the north west have camped for the night country but 
 it isn t all like this plum creek is the best i have seen the qu appelle and had supper 
 i am having great appetite valley is also good and i guess southern and drink lots of tea made out 
 of this bad manitoba is good water i haven t much to write you but thought would write a few 
 lines to let you how are you getting along collecting know we are well will send this to medicine hat 
 if i see a team going out there if i don t like calgary i won t stop there only 
 a very few days so i may not get any love and kisses for mamma dio and edna of your 
 letters at all if we ever get rich i will take this trip with you in say 10 years it

 everything was in bloom at that time and we considered this a paradise calgary herald january 13 1921 after a 
 week in the village freeze returned to winnipeg to purchase supplies while his partner isaac vanwart constructed a general store

 will not remain here doing town nothing but don t breathe this to mrs graves as it is only supposition 
 on my part since writing the above have sold upwards of 10 00 in groceries your letters now before sales

 sight of these grand old mommntaimis dmurimig time trip tip amid when i got out of the traiui stood for 
 somne time i easting on the majestic grandemir of this wonderl ui scenery no wonder they were named the rockies 
 for its rocks piled up on i ocks some turrets reaching high up in the h ieavens i commld not 
 help gazing at tlieni continmually for the remainder of the trip owing to the sublimity of the scenery and wondering 
 in awe at the omnipotence of jehovah who made all things we remained here three hours so engineers could get 
 sleep having run one thousand niiles without any we breakfasted here in a log shanty filling the inner man i 
 with two others then walked tip to the side of time mommntain where there are three columuis or rather pyramids 
 standing side by side amid from twenty to thirty feet high legend says hem e three sisters squaws were buried 
 in an tupright position and then the pyramids were built around them by their relatives but anyone who takes the 
 tromible to go and examiiie them easily sees that this legend is unfominded and that the pyramids were formed by

 ainiost everyone who arrived in calgary wanted to visit the rockies which could be seen clearly in time distance not 
 only that bin there were stories about gold and silver discoveries near castle mountain and that the niountains were rich 
 with minerals shortly before freeze wrote to his wife on december 4 1883 the calgary herald i epoi ted that 
 a major discovery had been made at the qmieen of the hills mine later reports however indicated that the discoveries 
 wei e false padmore is the end of a division and the c p r are bmnhding a large roundhouse 
 and other buildings that are reqmmired here thus is what is termed the hig park a level place of a 
 thiomusand acres between the motumitaimis amid in sonic parts covered with trees no snow yet at padmore about 9 we 
 got on board again bomund fmmrther west amid are soon miff at rather a slow rate of speed but the 
 differemit changes in the scenery make time pass qmuickhy have followed the river since entering the miiommntains no trouble to 
 bmmild the railway as far as it is that is to the summit but after that trouble begins great tunnels 
 will these are the mountains as freeze saw them on his way west the photograph was taken by surveyor g

 hope to straight as an arrow not very large with receive two letters from you or more we linibs short 
 and drooping about six inches look for our home letters like a small boy of snow at silver city and 
 twem uty miles expecting santa claus a highlight of freeze s trip to the mountains was his visit to silver 
 city seen here in 1889 with castle mountain in the background in 1883 there was great excitement with the claims 
 that valuable minerals had been found but this proved to be incorrect and when seen in 1889 silver city was

 i want fred to commie i intend leamnim mg him the bmusiness and if lie proves a business maim we 
 will start a branch somewhere a year from this spring i don t want to ask others to conic as 
 they might not succeed my opiniomi is that parties who cannot succeed east will not be able to compete with 
 the tact and ability of these western people so i womuld not pcrsmuade scott murray kevin etc to conic omit 
 part of a letter sunda 1 march 12 1884 it is just a cozy little place for us and the 
 children i never hiked to have people hiving iii the same house wouldn t be so bad if there was 
 plenty of room but we don t want to be cramped up i have had hard enough lines up to 
 this tinie so this summer i want a little comfort still we ll talk it over when you come the 
 trip put on plenty more underclothing it womuldn t be safe for you to cany much money with you but 
 drafts on bank of nova scotia winnipeg these drafts would be no good unless endorsed if anyone stole them they 
 might forge the endorsement sew them in your clothing underneath lots of sharpers on the trains always best to keep 
 secrets to yourself those are great kisses of dio s i ll get some good live ones soomi he s 
 a noble looking boy much love and lots of kisses for mamma amid the bairns from papa tuesday march 4 
 1884 tis uncertain just where the methodist church will locate i understand they can t get that corner lot mr 
 ramnsay the agent told nie so last night it snowed about 4 inches yesterday and last night this is the 
 most like winter we have seen but a few hours of sun will make it scarce the royal hotel is 
 going to move over this week it is i guess decided now that the church will go where i have 
 marked on block 42 wednesday p m fine today but cold last night ti ic presbyterians had a meeting to 
 see about moving their chmurch i guess they will soon move the east side is a sickly looking town now 
 old cellars tin cans and rubbish you may miot have to pay for time children under five or six i 
 forget which is either half price or free you will find out when you buy your tickets or before i 
 have written fred tonight quite a lou ug letter but you may be half way here before it arrives there 
 the post office is opposite my store quite near it is on block 51 about lot 30 and fronting on 
 stephen avenue the methodist church is to be moved and goes on lots 39 and 40 in block 40 very 
 near our house i expect the presbyterian church will also move up handy the lakes would be the cheapest route 
 if navigation was open but you will leave too soon to conic that way mrs reilly has a very small 
 house she does her own work not much fmurniturc but comfortable i h uavc just read over your letter lots 
 i might have written about things youi speak of btut you ll soon be here see for yourself and maybe 
 as i said before that yomu will be away when this letter arrives as it will likely be the 18
