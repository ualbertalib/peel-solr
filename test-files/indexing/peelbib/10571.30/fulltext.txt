 editor s page we promised last year to publish the patrician in march however in spite of the best intentions 
 we have had to await the arrival of the articles for the book and at the time of going to 
 press two have not arrived again we thank those who have assisted in the compilation and production of the patrician 
 particularly lt yd cole lt wn mckerracher and mrs jrd falconer two new features appear in this volume they are 
 the letters to the editor and articles submitted in response to our request in the last issue we welcome these 
 contributions and hope they will continue colonel jr stone s article on the war in italy the naviglio canal 1944 
 not only recounts a well fought battle but in our opinion is a masterly piece of military writing it will 
 bring back memories of italy the map which accompanies the article was obtained from colonel gj armstrong cd who resides 
 in edmonton and is the military advisor alberta district he served with the loyal edmonton regiment during world war ii 
 and as a major was the company commander of b coy during this battle major cah kemslev s article on 
 the united states army command and general staff college should be of particular interest to the younger members still serving 
 mr dravcott s account of the regiment s first entry into the trenches in flanders 5 january 1915 should prove 
 highly interesting to the world war i veterans it was our sad duty on november 22 last to attend the 
 funeral of brigadier wg colquhoun in victoria a firing party was provided by the first battalion and a piper by 
 the canadian scottish regiment shortie was laid to rest in sorrow by his comrades the eulogy appearing on page 67 
 was written by captain o gardner and was forwarded by the calgary branch who also sent a cheque for ten 
 dollars to the hamilton gault memorial fund in memory of brigadier colquhoun we are sorry to learn from kerry dumphv 
 of the ottawa branch that ex rsm wh marsden is blind mr marsden was the first rsm of the regiment 
 and has the proud distinction of holding regimental no 1 his address is 33 appian drive willowdale ontario the regimental

 yours respectfully mr g h bachman 12 hawkedon cres rexdale ontario editor s note the ppcli depot will be prepared 
 to receive any enquiries and forward them to mr bachman may 22 1967 dear sir enclosed is a short article 
 that i have been writing that may be of interest to readers of the patrician especially those who went overseas 
 with the regiment in 1939 and were stationed at the morval barracks in cove hants this incident happened as described 
 the actual date and news text may possibly be found by searching the several london dailies for january 1940 i 
 do not recall which one that i read it in an informal visit to the troops the princess canadian light 
 infantry 0:infan 0:try a permanent force regiment was expanded to full combat strength at the outbreak of the second world 
 war and went overseas with the first canadian division in december 1939 and were stationed in morval barracks cove hampshire 
 near farnborough and aldershot one day in early january a rolls royce drove to the barracks and stopped near the 
 parade square a young soldier was marching by when he was called over by a very dignified looking gentleman sitting 
 in the spacious 0:spa 0:cious back seat who said good morning i drove over from bagshot park to see the 
 canadians i used to live in canada and it s such a pleasure to see these young canadian soldiers going 
 about their duties they are so active and full of life the young soldier replied yes sir saluted then carried 
 on with his duties having no idea who the visitor was but was very surprised the next day when reading 
 a brief news report in the daily newspaper which read something 0:some 0:thing like this h r h the duke 
 of connaught paid an informal visit to canadian troops in morval barracks yesterday his royal highness recalled many previous 0:pre 
 0:vious visits to canadian troops in canada during his term of office as governor general of canada during the first 
 world war i was the young soldier he spoke to the day before sincerely and fraternally df parrott p 22271

 9 war in italy the naviglio canale 1944 colonel j r stone dso mc cd col j r stone commanding 
 officer edmonton regiment september 1944 to may 1946 commanding officer second battalion princess patricia s canadian light infantry 0:in 0:fantry 
 august 1950 to october 1953 major whj stutt cd officer commanding the depot wrote to me and asked me if 
 from my experiences on the battlefield as an infantryman i would write something of military interest to readers of the 
 patrician he gave me a deadline of january 31 1967 my first reaction was to ask myself why writing takes 
 time i am not a person who enjoys writing what action did i experience which would interest present day soldiers 
 glancing through some scraps of paper i have kept through the years i noticed one entitled re establishment of the 
 first cdn inf bde bridgehead over the naviglio canale at mr 407398 by the loyal edmonton regiment reference map italy 
 sheet 89111 nw fusignano 
 10 
 11 having in mind that the loyal edmonton regiment is now 3rd battalion princess patricia s canadian light infantry and 
 that col gg brown and lt col emk macgregor both of whom have commanded patricia battalions were junior officers serving 
 under me during the battle and that i also later commanded a patricia battalion i felt that this action would 
 be a good subject for a short article for the patrician i have no map of the area and no 
 photographs of the countryside i have not the time nor the inclination to dig out maps from the military archives 
 perhaps there is one in the regimental museum that could be reproduced i write mostly from a memory which like 
 the rest of me is fading with the years on december 11 1944 i felt that the loyal edmonton regiment 
 had a rest due to it we had been in constant action for weeks not heavy but of the wearing 
 kind that frazzles nerves and tires the muscles the battalion was concentrated near a village named traversera on the west 
 side of the lamone river look it up on the reference map if you have one at 430378 our rest 
 was a short one on the morning of december 13 i was told that i was under command 1 canadian 
 infantry brigade as of 1100 hours and i was ordered to report immediately to the headquarters of that brigade the 
 brigade commander brigadier jd smith now major general retd jd smith cbe dso etc outlined to me rather a desperate 
 situation his brigade was fully committed he had under command the carleton and york regiment from 3rd canadian infantry brigade 
 and he was fighting hard against repeated counter attacks to retain a hold over the naviglio canale the brigade commander 
 was in favour of marching my battalion as quickly as possible to relieve the situation my experience in battle from 
 pachino beach in sicily up to the lamone river had taught me the truth of the axiom time spent in 
 reconnaissance is never wasted i prevailed on the commander to allow me to take a personal reconnaissance of the situation 
 and went forward to the line of the canal between a farmhouse used as a tactical headquarters by the hastings 
 and prince edward regiment and the canal were many soldiers of that justly famous regiment they had had a real 
 shellacking from german counter attacks and their commanding officer lt colonel dc cameron later brigadier dc cameron dso ed felt 
 that the situation was serious and that an attack should be mounted against the enemy with all speed i left 
 that headquarters and pushed on to the tac hq of the carleton and york regiment you can read about the 
 reactions of the hastings and prince edward regiment to our joining in the fray in farley mowat s book the 
 regiment the loyal edmonton regiment and the carleton and york regiment were old friends in 1940 we trained together at 
 the guards depot in caterham to receive our colours from his majesty king george vi the retreat from dunkirk precluded 
 the ceremony from taking place but we had gained a great liking for one another during the training period one 
 other thing that we had in common was that both their commanding officers and i had risen to command from 
 the ranks in our own regiments the carleton and york regiment was commanded 0:com 0:manded by lt col jack ensor 
 now an executive in a candy company in new brunswick i felt that any attack that i might mount to 
 be successful must be carefully 0:care 0:fully planned and carried out deliberately without haste or confusion i calculated 
 12 that although it was not yet noon i needed until 1600 hours to march up my troops to a 
 concentration area coordinate the efforts of the supporting arms and cross the start line in good order i asked lt 
 col ensor if he could hold on until 1600 hours he being jack ensor said yes and i returned to 
 brigade headquarters at 1200 hours the brigade commander offered all available support including c squadron british columbia dragoons the cra 
 brigadier w zeigler was on hand and a support plan was produced entailing the use of artillery 4 2 mortars 
 and medium machine guns as the attack was to be launched in broad daylight smoke was required to screen the 
 move of the two forward companies across the start line during this time the battalion under the command of the 
 2 i c moved up to an assembly area the two forward companies b on the right and c on 
 the left moved into a fup at 408399 and crossed the start line the canal at h hour 1600 hrs 
 b company plus one troop of tanks pushed quickly along the road west of the canal and made contact with 
 the enemy at 1640 c company made contact at 1620 hrs but the supporting tanks of the bcds were held 
 up by fire from a disabled enemy tank at 1635 d company was sent through c company to take an 
 objective at 403406 enemy tanks and self propelled guns moved against both c and b companies but enemy infantry opposition 
 was quickly cleared up without many casualties to us support from tanks mmgs mortars and artillery was excellent and by 
 first light december 14 we were firmed up on our objectives positions were tac hq 410397 a coy 405402 b 
 coy 408401 c coy 400398 and d coy 403406 all companies had tank and mmg support and in addition souped 
 up two pounder a t guns littlejohns had joined the forward companies the enemy was not disposed to leave the 
 interlopers alone and at 1340 hours d company was heavily counter attacked the battalion 3 mortars fired sos tasks our 
 mmgs harrassed approaches the brigade mortars fired in depth and all were supported by artillery both field and medium the 
 counter attack continued until 1540 hrs and by this time d company although holding on tenaciously had suffered heavy casualties 
 i found it necessary to commit a company to strengthen the battalion position at 1940 hrs that night the battalion 
 was deployed as follows tac hq 410397 a coy 402406 b coy 409401 c coy 405398 d coy 404406 the 
 night of 14 december 0:decem 0:ber was fairly quiet except for sporadic gun fire at 0810 hrs 15 december an 
 enemy tank ran into our minefield hawkins grenades laid by d coy at mr 403407 d company attacked with piats 
 and the tank commander was taken prisoner the tank was a panther and in good working order except for a 
 blown track late that afternoon c company commanded by lieutenant emk mac gregor reported increased activity at mr 403409 c 
 company had gone into action commanded by capt g brown but he was wounded quite early in the battle lieutenant 
 macgregor a very young and inexperienced officer had then taken over the company whatever macgregor lacked in experience he made 
 up with guts at 2000 hrs under light artillery and mortar support macgregor led c company in a frontal attack 
 on the enemy held objective although fired on frontly and from both flanks by machine guns and faustpatronen he charged 
 at the head 
 13 of his men routed the enemy and was on his objective by 2105 hrs for this skilful and courageous 
 effort lieutenant macgregor was awarded the military cross wasps flame throwing carriers were ordered forward to assist c coy lo 
 hold against considerable enemy strength to the north heavy enemy fighting patrols bothered the company all night but they beat 
 off all attempts of the enemy lo infiltrate at 0755 hrs 16 december two enemy tanks appeared at mr 402411 
 but our littlejohns decided that discretion was the better part of valour and did not engage the rest of the 
 day passed without incident and at 0145 hrs december 17 lt colonel jv allard now general jv allard cbe dso 
 ed and his gallant vandoos took command of the area the numbers of enemy wounded or killed were unknown to 
 us however we tcok 91 prisoners cf war our own casualties were 12 killed and 38 wounded this was an 
 excellent battalion battle it corroborated many of the elementary 0:ele 0:mentary facts that we are taught concerning the tactics of 
 the battlefield here they are a time spent in proper preparation is not wasted the time beween 0:be 0:ween 1200 
 hrs when orders were received and 1600 hrs when the start line was crossed allowed for proper reconnaissance an unhurried 
 move up of the fighting men a good meal proper coordination of all support and sent off the attack to 
 a good start b wide dispersion of troops in the fup saved casualties when the area was heavily shelled prior 
 to jump off time c bold tank crews were a great help in getting the infantry onto the objectives d 
 brick houses are comfortable but dangerous it took half an hour only to decide to dig and live in the 
 cold cold ground rather than in the houses on the first objective why half an hour it took half an 
 hour for the first enemy shells to hit the houses e anti tank mines are wonderful for quick consolidation of 
 a position 0:posi 0:tion however if you lay them pick them up before you move f defensive fire should be 
 in depth may i conclude by saying that this rather insignificant little battle gave those of us who took part 
 in it great satisfaction we attained our objectives with very few casualties we were re assured of our ability to 
 fight successfully we renewed our faith in our supporting arms particularly in our armoured friends the british columbia dragoons and 
 we knew that we had the measure of the enemy and that the successful end of hostilities was only a

 15 regimental depot the depot has just finished a year which has seen many changes in personnel methods of operating 
 and trains of thought during the period march april a new commanding officer major whj stutt and adjutant capt pa 
 robison appeared they were followed in the next few months by a new rsm wo 1 rj king cd and 
 new assistant chief instructor capt dit roe cd as our readers probably know having read soldier and other magazines the 
 canadian armed forces changed on ist april 1966 from the regional command system to a functional command system we found 
 ourselves under control and direction of training command headquarters situated some 800 miles from edmonton while the home station battalion 
 situated in the same building came under mobile command headquarters situated even further east in montreal some 2200 miles from 
 edmonton to add to the dispersal of command the garrison we are situated in came under the control of still 
 another command air transport with headquarters at trenton ontario yet for all this we find that our jobs are still 
 the same and the same or similar reports and returns are required the depot participated in a ceremony on 16 
 september 1966 in which the city of edmonton presented the freedom of the city to the regiment maj gen cb 
 ware dso cd the colonel of the regiment accepted the freedom 0:free 0:dom on behalf of the regiment and the 
 visible proof of the ceremony a large silver shield now rests in the home station officers mess on the 14th 
 of december we were honoured to provide facilities for the russian national gymnastics team whose personnel included such well known 
 names as alexander mishakov the head coach vladimir shelkounikou the women s coach and petrik larissa a gold medal winner 
 at the 1966 world gymnastic championships the picture on this page shows one of our pt staff with some women 
 members of the team the russian team conducted a gymnastic clinic for the top 50 gymnasts from alberta and spectators 
 were allowed to watch the grace and beauty of the team members movements were quite a treat and all of

 from a local scout troop in appreciation for this service the officers presented a silver bugle to the scout troop 
 prior to the regiment s departure for england this bugle remained in the possession of the troop commander s family 
 until certain former members of the regiment learned of its existence and arranged for its presentation to the regimental museum 
 where it holds a place of honour the museum is in fine shape as the photographs show and contains many 
 articles of interest depicting the regiment s history certain items from it will be removed and displayed in various centres

 27 first battalion the year 1966 ushered in our final year of service in germany with the first battalion acknowledged 
 as the senior and best trained battalion in four canadian infantry brigade group during the past year the battalion garnered 
 many honours both in the field of sport and in military skills thus culminating our service overseas in true patricia 
 style the battalion participated in the annual round of concentrations commencing with haltern in may where the battalion enjoyed a 
 week of company training and were joined by a platoon from the devon and dorset regiment the weeks training cycle 
 finished with a simple battalion exercise the sennelager concentration with the emphasis on field firing exercises took place in june 
 with the honours for the skill at arms competition again coming to the first battalion the fine efforts by all 
 ranks resulted in the battalion winning all but one trophy in the brigade meet taking the pistol smg and rifle 
 competitions with the commanding officer lt col moncrief and the rsm woi buxton winning the cos and rsms contest the 
 tabloid sports day was won outright by our team bringing the battalion the grand aggregate trophy as well soltau concentration 
 was watered down to ten days per battalion group from the previous brigade three week concentration due to the advent 
 of a happy warriors of b coy soltau training area august 1966 
 full complement of apcs within units of 4 cibg thus the increase in vehicles and mobility cut down the time 
 and space factor for manoeuvering within the confines of the soltau area limiting use to battalion group training the battalion 
 enjoyed a good week of company group training ending with a full blown battalion group exercise against b coy 2 
 rcr aided by an umpire staff also from 2 rcr the highlight for the officers at the close of this 
 training period was a barbecue at rheinsalen camp where the co was finally successful in having a sheep roasted although 
 this animal was of the long horned variety peculiar to the lunenberg heath some persons to this day claim it 
 was more similar in species to a goat than a sheep just to add to our general confusion during the 
 commencement of rotation in october we were faced with a divisional exercise in the eastern part of western germany despite 
 the fact that the battalion was further depleted by the loss of our advance party to canada the patricias played 
 a major role in exercise checkmate having a screening role in front of 4 cibg with under command 10 hussars 
 and a squadron of royals plus our supporting battery f bty 2 rcha supplemented by two additional troops from 2nd 
 regiment and a troop of green archers from 23 mcd regiment ra the logistic support became a bit of a 
 headache due to distance and the mixed bag of troops under command exercise checkmate heralded our last exercise in germany 
 and the battalion moved home to fort macleod in record time with no breakdowns looking forward to returning to canada 
 on the social international and sports scene many events occurred the most notable are mentioned in the following paragraphs the 
 first such event was the addition to the battalion on christmas eve 1966 in the form of a bundle of 
 st bernard fluff officer cadet lloyd george knowsmyfather 0:knows 0:myfather who weighed in at 20 lbs and became a member 
 of the mess as a result of the efforts of the living in officers now having reached 2 lt our 
 pup is undergoing the throes of quarantine at the home station and has reached the 140 lb level the officers 
 mess was plagued throughout 1966 by the fund by which the single officers gleaned enough money to ship lloyd george 
 home once again first battalion won the hamilton gault trophy making the third win since the inception of this award 
 by the founder in addition c coy garnered the hamilton gault skill at arms trophy for the second time on 
 11 may 1966 mrs a hamilton gault paid a visit to the battalion to present the trophy to the commanding 
 officer lt col moncrief it was a repeat performance of her visit in early 1964 when mrs gault performed the 
 same duty at fort macleod 2nd lt larry glover and a team of marchers from c coy participated in the 
 maple leaf marches in may and eased to a narrow win over many national contingents in the annual event held 
 at hoogeven holland late in june major ce goodman with a 100 man guard colour party corps of drums and 
 an administrative element left sennelager early in preparation for participation in the 50th anniversary ceremonies commemorating the battle of the 
 somme jointly sponsored by the british french and canadian governments 0:govern 0:ments 28

 known grave smaller ceremonies were held the same day at guadecourt and courcelette on 2nd and 3rd july parades were 
 held in albert and peronne with a final ceremony at the large french military cemetery in raincourt the patricia contingent 
 was honoured by the visit of a number of distinguished visitors to their tent camp at beaumont hamel these included 
 field marshall viscount alexander of tunis lt gen howard graham former cgs the honourable mr roger teillet minister of veteran 
 s affairs and mr mcßean president of the royal canadian legion on 5 july the patricia s proceeded to ypres 
 belgium to bid farewell to the city and to pay a last personal homage to our fallen comrades at the 
 regimental 0:regimen 0:tal memorial at frezenberg that evening major ce goodman and the patricia contingent exercised its right and privilege 
 on behalf of the regiment to march through the streets of ypres with drums beating bayonet fixed and colours flying 
 the last post was sounded at the menin gate followed by a reception in the fabled cloth hall for the 
 worthy burghers of the city a regimental plaque was presented to burgomeister deham by lt col moncrief to commemorate the 
 close association between the city of ypres and the battalion during our stay in europe field mcrshal viscount alexander of

 a party from the battalion participated in the annual nijmegen marches along with a large contingent from 4 cibg major 
 dick cottingham held office as the brigade co ordinator with hq in nijmegen and all participants thoroughly enjoyed dutch hospitality 
 in sports it was a good year throughout with all teams registering wins or near wins the soccer team had 
 an undefeated year in brigade play for the third successive year the team branched out in 1966 with considerable success 
 competing successfully with british army teams in germany in addition to holding many friendly matches with german and belgian teams 
 the battalion hockey team came up with a good season ending with fourth place in league play advancing into the 
 semi finals to defeat the gunners and moved on to nearly scoring an upset in the finals in basketball the 
 team lost out in the finals to 2 rcha after a hectic series while our fastball team after winning league 
 play failed to win the final play offs and ended up in the runner up slot the ski team after 
 a training session in st anton austria proceeded to oberjock for the 2 division and baor meets the patricia team 
 gained much experience in these competitions and represented the unit ably although no trophies were won our sky divers had 
 an active year participating in many demonstration jumps culminating in representing the canadian army at the british army championships at 
 netheravon england in august 
 eleven judokas from 4 cibg eight of them patricias competed in the british army judo championships in england in late 
 october with the group making a sweep of nearly all categories of competition the patricias became the first team to 
 ever capture the british army championship for two consecutive years in early october first and second battalions exchanged advance parties 
 headed by their respective seconds in command major mg levy and major dg macleod and the realization that we really 
 were returning to canada was finally with us the major rotation began in early november and continued throughout the month 
 with the final draft proceeding home on 30 november first battalion are now in the throes of settling into hamilton 
 gault barracks edmonton and facing the usual demands of a changed role within the field force and getting acclimatized again 
 we wish our second battalion well in stepping into our operational slot in north west europe and we feel that 
 we have left our mark on 4 cibg and expect that our sister battalion will add to the annals of 
 the regiment in like order officers mess the year 1966 was given a rousing start for the new year when 
 the officers mess combined with that of the gunners and strathconas for a new year s ball at fort beausejour 
 with lots of compah music and german sekt old man 65 was shown the door and 1966 invited in the 
 single officers with their usual style entertained at the first mess party of the year they hosted a hootenany on 
 21 jan that was enjoyed by everyone a series of movie nights began in february soft chairs good movies and 
 an open bar ensured success during the year 007 peter sellers and a host of other actors provided good entertainment 
 for the members dr autcherlony director of music toronto conservatory gave a lecture and concert on 9 feb following that 
 he was invited back to the mess for cocktails st valentine s day was celebrated two days early however in 
 the correct manner on 12 feb whoever produced the mistletoe was a bit out of season but well into the 
 spirit of things on 11 and 12 mar our ex co lt col gg brown returned to fort macleod for 
 a visit he lunched with the officers on 11 mar and gave a talk on new developments mobile command and

 the officers b mess a echelon maintained its independence the b mess functioned next to wiltse s circus and provided 
 cold beer barbecues and coloured movies the sgt offrs games night was held on 24 jun in the sgts mess 
 again the sgts proved themselves able hosts their display of firelighting with gasoline was instructive and showed their true pioneer 
 spirit the sgt s version of roof walking the excellent buffet and many undoubtedly true war stories made it a 
 night that will be hard to match next year august saw our venerable twenty one charlie major ga gunton and 
 his wife leave for the greener pastures of england to wish him well the officers and ladies dined them out 
 with a formal dinner on 12 august our last significant function of the year occurred on 3 oct when the

 canada at the end of october lt col blake baile and his officer of 2 rcr played host to our

 evening to remember during the remainder of the season we were busy with games dances and generally enjoying our final 
 year in germany before the preparations for rotation and turnover to 2 ppcli in march the birthday of our colonel 
 in chief was celebrated with inter company games during the day the traditional broom i 100 was waived this year 
 primarily because the officers complained they never win and secondly the battalion hockey team had priority on the ice in 
 june during the sennelager concentration the officers and sergeants participated in their annual games night with the sergeants again taking 
 the honours during this period the 2 rcha sergeants mess challenged the 1 ppcli sergeants mess to a home and

 superb job done as team captain of the brigade s judo team represented in england besides being upgraded to the

 the year with many functions nearly every saturday night the members enjoyed participation in bingos or dancing to music supplied 
 by agecoutay s buckskins the tour of germany was well rounded off by the cpls mess rotation dance on the 
 night of 24 25 sep 1966 some 315 people turned out to make this a most successful affair many enjoyed 
 the party so much that they were still there at 7 and 8 o clock the next morning exercise effort 
 tired lt jp mcmanus exercise effort tired was a six day adventure training exercise carried out by the assault pioneer 
 platoon from 15 to 20 august 1966 this exercise was originated by sgt lewis ae the pioneer platoon sergeant and 
 consisted of a road move from fort macleod to rudesheim four days of cruising on the rhine river in assault 
 boats and a road move from wessel to fort macleod planning started in the late spring after approval had been 
 received from hq 4 cibg to conduct the exercise three assault boats were borrowed from 4 field squadron the use 
 of the watermanship training area was obtained and the pioneers spent five days paddling loading and portaging the boats in 
 preparation for the exercise this training period ended with a short cruise on the mohne and ruhr rivers from the 
 watermanship area to wickede after this shakedown preparations were discontinued until after the sennelager concentration when the pioneers underwent battle 
 swimming tests and collected the remander of their equipment by 14 august the pioneer trade shop was crammed with boat 
 hooks hard rations paddles navigation flags and all the equipment required for a trip into the wilderness in the early 
 morning of 15 august the equipment was loaded into two 214 ton vehicles and we left fort macleod on our 
 adventure the trip to rudesheim was via the autobahns and the boredom of this travel was only broken by haversack 
 lunches which we consumed and by a one hour wait while an accident was cleared from the road ahead of 
 us we arrived in the rudesheim area late that afternoon and started our search for a campsite after more than 
 an hour of searching we found a launching 0:launch 0:ing site but no campsite being flexible and having seen an 
 island in the rhine across from the launch site we proceeded to load our boats and head for the island 
 in hopes of establishing our base camp the first boat under command of sgt lewis cast off and started out 
 while the second boat under cpl lalonde j made approximately 50 meters before its outboard motor quit and the boat 
 had to be towed across the river by the first crew the third boat with myself with cpl forsyth le 
 at the helm managed to cross with the motor producing only half speed 
 37 when we arrived at the island the owner met us and gave us permission to set up our camp 
 we set up our shelter had supper and attempted without luck to repair the motors at dusk our host invited 
 us to join him for a party at his cottage being good pioneers we couldn t let this opportunity pass 
 we accepted his invitation and spent an enjoyable evening as his guests and drinking his wine early next morning we 
 struck camp and headed down river the river police guided us through the small boat channels near rudesheim and sgt 
 lewis boat towing cpl lalonde s boat soon pulled away from us as they approached the lorelei which is noted 
 for its narrowness rough water and barge traffic cpl lalonde s boat broke loose and was saved only by hard 
 paddling which moved the boat out of the main channel we all met at a camp platz for lunch and 
 then shoved off again cpl forsyth soon consolidated his position as pilot of our boat by being the only one 
 who could keep the motor running eventually we reached koblenz and sgt lewis forged ahead to find a campsite there 
 were some interesting 0:inter 0:esting moments as cpl lalonde s crew paddled their boat through the rough water at the 
 junction of the rhine and mosel rivers however we all made it through and stopped at another camp platz overlooking 
 the junction of these two rivers the next morning we cast off on the second wet leg of the exercise 
 this day was uneventful except for a shortage of gasoline we managed to get to bonn set up camp on 
 a stretch of rocky shore and sent a search party out for gas after three hours our search party came 
 back with gas that they had to venture into the heart of the city to find first battalion on the 
 move in germany another of many moves to training areas during 1966 
 38 the third morning of river travel dawned cool and overcast a change from the other days which had been 
 sunny and warm this day passed quietly with few problems and our time was spent watching both the river traffic 
 and surrounding countryside we camped that night at a camp platz south of duesseldorf prepared supper and bedded down under 
 the observation of adjacent 0:adja 0:cent tourists early the next morning we were under way again with prayers that the 
 motors would last one more day we finally arrived at wessel after coaxing the motors along for seven hours and 
 we camped at an unused ferry landing at the edge of town the remaining daylight hours were spent cleaning both 
 ourselves 0:our 0:selves and our equipment on 20 august our vehicles arrived at wessel from fort macleod and we loaded 
 our equipment for the return trip this short exercise was a pleasant change from the routine of garrison soldiering and 
 gave us a chance to see some new and interesting areas of germany during our 296 kilometer coverage of the 
 rhine river we met many interesting people and were overwhelmed by the reception that we received 0:re 0:ceived at our 
 stopping places the exercise gave all of us the opportunities to use our initiative in the unfamiliar fields of small 
 boat handling and logistics while away from the direct support of the unit for these points alone it was a 
 valuable exercise to us as well as being an unusual and enjoyable type of training 1 ppcli wives club rotation 
 year 1966 was an active and conclusive year for the 1 ppcli wives club since this was the last year 
 of the battalion s three year tour of germany many last minute projects and displays were planned and to a 
 good extent carried out hospital visiting was still included in the year s programme gifts left over from the christmas 
 children s party were well received by the unfortunate children in bmh the collection of magazines for the hospital and 
 pocket books for the wvs kept many in reading material this was extended to a sale of pocket books at 
 each meeting for a nominal charge to help while away the time while the men were on schemes the hemer 
 senior school was the receiver of a donation to make picture frames in order to have a weekly artist display 
 and teach the students more about art appreciation due to early postings mrs cole resigned as the club s president 
 and another valued member mrs mccabe also left both spent a great deal of time and energy working on the 
 club s projects and the ladies were sorry to see them depart our easter bake sale was a march event 
 followed by an easter bonnet parade and egg hunt at the april meeting winners of several categories were mrs chatry 
 mrs hayden and mrs gunton other forms of entertainment at the meetings included a cookie and recipe exchange to spice 
 it up bingos spelling bees to sharpen the ladies wits and a very novel mad costumes and charades evening 
 39 sports weren t neglected in the club s activities as the ladies bowling club striked and spared through the 
 season and the softball club went into full swing with warm weather volunteers to enter the nijmegen march were nil 
 even though many members were sure they could outdo their male competitors talk and discussion on the edmonton pmqs and 
 the city in general by a former edmontonian gave the ladies an idea of what to expect upon rotation in 
 the fall the final meeting in september gave the ladies a chance to get last minute gifts and souvenirs from 
 a glass blower demonstrator and copper man also the progress of the club s penny auction to be held on 
 september 17 was discussed the chairman mrs beggs spent long hours sewing doll dresses washing used clothing etc a white 
 elephant sales was to be held in november as a remembrance of the club s three years in germany the 
 members received a lovely engraved spun silver souvenir plate in conclusion 1966 was a busy year many farewells till we 
 meet again to fellow members who also were presented with souvenir engraved spoons by the club many thanks to the

 second battalion from wainwright to westphalia from hot dogs and coke to bratwurst and beer the life of the second 
 battalion princess patricia s canadian light infantry during 1966 has been as varied and intensive a year as any in 
 its peacetime history edmonton wainwright and west germany were the main centres of activity although at various times throughout the 
 year patricia s were to be found in many far flung places as in any year there were periods of 
 pride and elation mixed with tragedy depression and humor with heads barely back to normal and legs still rubbery from 
 the festive season the battalion left edmonton on the fourth of january for the winter concentration the weather lived up 
 to its reputation average 30 but the battalion proved it could effectively carry out its tasks under arctic conditions company 
 smokers provided a welcome thaw in the routine especially for c company whose personnel had had a rather disconcerting introduction 
 to skiing maj gen cb ware presents a painting of the famous patricia defence of frezenberg to mayor vince dantzer 
 on the occasion of 2 ppcli receiving the freedom of the city of edmonton on behalf of the regiment 41 
 
 42 trooping the colour 17 sep 66 with maj gen cb ware colonel of the regiment taking the salute february 
 was a restful month from a social point of view although the training calendar was a full as ever unit 
 courses began in earnest with officer and senior nco training preparing the students for future command decisions those officers writing 
 promotion exams began to suffer from the usual pre exam symptoms headaches weak stomachs shaking legs and bloodshot eyes however 
 everyone managed to take one night off for the western hoe down party the sergeants mess hosted a variety of 
 dances during this month and rumour has it that s sgt osborn and sgt wilson are potential instructors for arthur 
 murray the corporals mess celebrated integration s most rewarding change that of serving liquor in all messes cpl anderson whose 
 picture had graced the sentinal that month absorbed a fair amount of ribbing from the non photogenic types march brought 
 on a resumption of a full social life in all messes as the battalion celebrated the birthday of our colonel 
 in chief mess dinners were held in all messes prior to march 17 but the highlight as always was lady 
 patricia s birthday itself the finals of the various inter company sports were held with a company dominating most of 
 the sports however c company 0:com 0:pany managed to come through with a smashing victory in push ball later on 
 in the day the epic battle of the giants the broom i 100 game between the officers and the sergeants 
 was fought under anything but ideal conditions with the sergeants squeaking through by a disputed 2 1 score the verbal 
 war in the sergeants mess whose members entertained the officers following the game was almost as hectic as the broom 
 ball game the officers eventually retired home to their anxious wives leaving the sergeants still standing on the field of 
 battle although we gather one qmsi had a rough drive home 
 43 the evening was the occasion of the formal ball in honour of lady patricia and once the champagne began 
 to flow the evening turned into an excellent affair the working wives complaints were long and loud the next day 
 as the husbands wished them well from the comfort of their respective beds the month of march also brought a 
 touch of sadness to the home station as major ge henderson co of the depot left edmonton for a new 
 posting a mess dinner was held in his honour where conversation naturally turned to the geological freak known at mount 
 henderson soaring in majestic splendour in front of the officers mess major henderson will be sorely missed but fortunately 0:for 
 0:tunately the home station regained an old friend in major whj stutt his replacement as co the hockey team finished 
 a highly successful season in march by winning the edmonton city league for the first time it was a case 
 of perseverance and desire winning the day as the team of ten played against far larger teams cpl einarsson the 
 old man of the team and cpl peskett provided the spark and leadership but all the players worked together as 
 well balanced hungry hockey team april of course brought with it the celebration of kapyong day when all ranks of 
 the battalion remembered one of the patricia s most famous battle honours the atmosphere was one of gaiety and exuberance 
 at the various mess dinners that night as old war stories were retold or invented but perhaps in the minds 
 of those who fought at kapyong there was a small note of thankfulness 0:thankful 0:ness in being able to reminisce 
 so lightly over that hard fought battle the easter period also brought with it a visit from one of the 
 most famous men of the century earl mountbatten visited edmonton to address the sir winston churchill society and he took 
 time off from his busy schedule to inspect the ppcli cadet corps and to attend a reception in his honour

 of a year s work as the soldiers worked themselves into an efficient battle team beginning with platoon and company 
 exercises all companies moulded into a battalion that proved its worth on the larger scale exercise the musketry teams were 
 all in action at this time with the 2nd battalion smg team winning the canadian services grand aggregate trophy cpl

 honour in being granted the freedom of the city of edmonton mayor vince dantzer presented the freedom to major general

 cpl harris and his mess committee throwing a very successful dinner in the corporals mess pte dee president of the 
 men s canteen committee obviously enjoyed the lunch he had with lt col basham and major general ware but the 
 highlight as always was the trooping the colour itself which this year included an apc roll past the ball that 
 night provided the most colourful aspect to the week s events the next six weeks were fully occupied with the 
 last minute preparations for the move overseas captain murray stewart s rotation office staffed by sgt summersgill and cpls brown 
 mcneil and peskett was soon floundering under a mass of paper work but they completed the job in a first 
 class manner the battalion was complete in germany by the end of november and instead of coping with snow and 
 a faulty television set people now had to adjust to a different language and perpetual rain but the main concern 
 in those first hectic days was passing the driver s license exam in which from all reports the women far 
 excelled the men sgt harrison and cpl domshy eventually got their gym back and work on the sports programme got 
 under way 
 47 the grey cup party at the end of november brought a touch of home to many people although lt 
 gord reay and his fellow stalwart ottawa fans bowed to the inevitable as saskatchewan squeaked through to win rumour had 
 it that padre clarke said an extra prayer the following morning the christmas season was full of the usual festive 
 spirits with various parties and visits throughout 0:through 0:out the period the sergeants finally admitted after the officers at home 
 to the sergeants that the adjutant can smile but perhaps the most soul satisfying occasion of the holiday season was 
 the party the battalion sponsored for the german orphans in the area it proved that in matters of charity and 
 good will there is never a language barrier indeed it was difficult to say who enjoyed the party more as 
 the children obviously loved the presents and the food while the soldiers fell in love with the antics and playful 
 smiles of the children ptes morrisette and carsh almost adopted a child but they felt they wouldn t have enough 
 room in the quarters this rounded out the year for the 2nd patricia s it was one replete with solid 
 training an abundance of courses a full social life and a mixture of hard times as well as good times 
 for all concerned the battalion filled a varied role of necessity in this modern age and showed that it has 
 the energy and initiative to carry out whatever task it may be assigned germany will prove whether the battalion can 
 keep up the good work but there seems to be little doubt in the minds of its members it will 
 be done well as always it s hard to soy who s enjoying themselves more pte derwin morrisette or his

 on operations on the indonesian border of sarawak where by dint of intense patrolling and ambush operations we had succeeded 
 in stopping the hitherto frequent enemy incursions over the border and where for the last month we had no contact 
 we did however come under occasional outbreaks of innacurate mortar fire from the other side and we suffered one casualty 
 during this period from enemy mining activities early in january we handed over to the ist bn the durham light 
 infantry and by various means we returned to england where we all dispersed to our homes for six weeks leave 
 on 21 february we reassembled at felixstowe and plunged straight into a strenuous programme of training made all the more 
 necessary 0:neces 0:sary by the lack of opportunity during the previous two years it was at this point that larry 
 gollner who had been training officer at the depot arrived in the battalion and took over the recce platoon our 
 role was now that of a strategic reserve battalion and as such life was busy at seven days notice we 
 were sent to ireland for five weeks to train it did not pass unnoticed that this coincided with the fiftieth 
 anniversary of the easter rising in dublin fortunately nothing untoward occurred and at the end of april we returned to 
 felixtowe battalion training on salisbury plain followed and then after a spell of leave two major exercises took place on 
 one the battalion was transported by air complete with most of its equipment from one end of england to the 
 other and somehow emerged in one piece able to fight a couple of battles finally to complete the year we 
 had our annual administrative inspection the first for three years and having defeated our brigade commander at this we all 
 went home for christmas in 1967 we are due to move to baor again where we are to represent baor 
 in the prix leclerc and where we hope to be joined by peter littlehales and his family he will be 
 replaced by david williams who is now adjutant larry gollner is due to leave us shortly he and christine will 
 be sadly missed at the time of writing his successor is not yet known but whoever he is he can 
 be sure of a welcome with best wishes from the rifle brigade

 67 brigadier wg colquhoun cbe mc commanding officer princess patricia s canadian light infantry february 16th 1937 september 14th 1940 
 3n euiogy to a patricio a comrade the recent passing of brigadier wg colquhoun cbe mc will have come as 
 a great shock to all members of the patricia association in the calgary area and indeed to all old soldiers 
 as he was very well known here he was born on august 9th 1888 and deciding on a military career 
 early in life he presented himself for entry into royal military college kingston 0:king 0:ston in 1906 due to the 
 limited number of vacancies in that year he did not gain a place but was gazetted as a second lieutenant 
 to the 91st highlanders an ontario militia regiment in after years he often said how lucky he was that his 
 first bid to become a regular failed for had it succeeded he would have been an rcr all his life 
 instead of a patricia 
 68 shorty meant the regiment to generations of patricias particularly to those who served between the wars and in 1939 
 40 outspoken to the point of bluntness he was probably a little too prickly to attain extreme high rank his 
 fury on discovering that a government he dubbed without a soul pusillanimous and parsimonious had failed to emblazon regimental insignia 
 on the headstones of the fallen in world war ii is well remembered thorough in all things whatever he did 
 he did with all his might and his enthusiasm never failed to inspire energy in his subordinates anything not quite 
 straight was abhorrent to him and what he considered to be sharp practice caused him to boil over with righteous 
 indignation which when dealing with superiors he sometimes failed to temper with discretion entering the banking business he was posted 
 to prince albert and was there when the great war broke out in 1914 hastening at full speed to the 
 first mobilizing regiment the newly formed ppcli he so impressed the commanding officer colonel francis farquhar late of the coldstream 
 guards that he was accepted as a lieutenant despite the fact that he had no active service experience a prerequisite 
 on which colonel farquhar had stated he would insist in january 1915 he was selected to form an elite body 
 of marksmen to deal with enemy snipers their immediate success laid the foundation of marksmanship 0:marksman 0:ship in which the 
 regiment has ever since taken the greatest pride during the night of 27 february 1915 lieutenant colquhoun was sent out 
 to reconnoitre the ground over which an attack was expected he penetrated the german line and brought back vital information 
 later on the same night he volunteered to go out a second time and accompanied by the second in command 
 major a hamilton gault proceeded to the enemy position major hamilton gault completed his survey and returned shorty was not 
 so fortunate he was captured by a working party when nearly a hundred yards inside the german trench system he 
 staggered his captors who had never seen a canadian soldier before by saying that at 6 feet 7 inches he 
 was the smallest man in the regiment for his gallantry and devotion to duty he was awarded the military cross 
 during his captivity he made three daring attempts at escape almost reaching holland on one occasion this display of determination 
 was brought to the notice of the secretary of state and a mention in despatches followed on the reconstitution of 
 the permanent force in 1919 lieutenant colquhoun 0:colqu 0:houn was promoted captain and appointed the regiments first peace time adjutant 
 needless to say as a training officer he was tremendous his whole military philosophy could be summed up in the 
 famous old infantry adage of look march and shoot he captained the regimental rifle team for years and in 1925 
 was selected as adjutant to the bisley team he subsequently commanded 0:com 0:manded companies with distinction in both winnipeg and 
 victoria and attained command of the regiment in february 1937 the control and example which he set had much to 
 do with the easy change from peace time to war conditions which the regiment enjoyed wherever and whenever patricias gather 
 they talk about the hectic spring and summer of 1940 the abortive norwegian expedition salisbury plain mcnaughtons travelling circus etc 
 and etc 
 69 anecdotes about shorty during this period are legion the vision of him standing complete with a seven foot shepherd 
 s crook on top of a damp snowy scottish hill with his troops bivouacked all around comes vividly to mind 
 he looked as one wag said like moses defying the lightning his heart was set on commanding second brigade but 
 it was not to be selected to command a training brigade in canada he was promoted to brigadier and left 
 the regiment with heavy heart on 9th september 1940 the story that he made his entire brigade wear ppcli flashes 
 was found to be slightly exaggerated in 1945 his outstanding work was recognized by an award of the cbe the 
 regiment saw shorty no more in the flesh until after his retirement 0:retire 0:ment that he was with it in 
 spirit up to the firing of the last shot there can be no doubt his efforts in the regiment s 
 cause from the beginning to the end of the korean campaign will not be forgotten troopships with ppcli personnel on 
 board never left or returned to port without his being there to say god speed or well done the regimental 
 association of which he was a past president and the welfare of old comrades along with hunting and fishing were 
 the greatest interests 0:in 0:terests of his last years barely a month passed without an inquiry about some forgotten and 
 dimly remembered name the loss of his beloved wife jean shattered him for a time but he came back considering 
 it his duty to carry on it can truly be said that he was incapable of a mean action word 
 or thought to be with him was a joy and one could not come away from him without feeling the 
 better for having been in his presence and when the one great scorer comes to write against our name he 
 writes not that we won or lost but how we played the game shorty colquhoun handed in his score on 
 18 november 1966 the one great scorer can have had little difficulty in filling in that card the regiment has 
 never produced a better patricia or a more perfect gentleman canadian linen supply co ltd 8631 stadium road phone 424

 four companies of his regiment the 3rd to ascend the missouri river and upon reaching a point on its left 
 east bank near the mouth of the little platte river and within a range of 20 miles above or below 
 ts confluence select such position as in his judgement is calculated for the site of a permanent cantonment with this 
 direction from united states war department colonel henry leavenworth united states infantry left st louis missouri with four companies of 
 infantry on 19 april 1827 to found the army post that bears his name like all good infantrymen he made 
 his own appreciation when he found the terrain at the junction of the missouri and little platte rivers unsuitable for 
 military purposes and he moved his command 35 miles north bounced the missouri to the right west bank and established 
 his garrison along the trail to sante fe his action was duly approved by the war department in september 1827 
 in those days a colonel s word was law today the post is in the state of kansas but in 
 1827 it was in indian territory under the protection of the army however a sizeable and prosperous town soon grew 
 up outside fort leavenworth as the cantonment was renamed in 1832 in the years which followed the post became increasingly 
 important in maintaining peace among the indians and protecting travellers to the west buffalo bill cody and general george custer 
 are only two of the famous names associated with the fort they serve to remind today s visitor that through 
 this army post passed thousands of pioneers travelling the oregon and sante fe trails to settle the western united states 
 in 1881 general william tecumseh sherman established at the fort a school of application for infantry and cavalry a two 
 year course for young lieutenants in 1902 the general service and staff college was instituted from which grew the united 
 states army command and general staff college of today the commandant of the college is a major general who also 
 wears the hats of post commander area commander and commanding general of the 
 72 combined arms group which is co located at fort leavenworth by united states army standards fort leavenworth is a 
 small post with only about 2 000 all ranks exclusive of students on strength the post contains the normal amenities 
 such as post exchange commissary and an 18 hole golf course and in addition has married quarters for the officers 
 of the staff and the students attending the 10 month regular course the physical and human resources of the college 
 are used for many different courses study groups and briefings as well as an extensive non resident instruction programme for 
 national guard and reserve officers the main effort however is put into conducting one 10 month regular staff course of 
 750 students and two 5 month associate staff courses of 400 students each year as canadian officers have not been 
 attending the associate course i ll only mention that it is more concentrated accompanying families are not authorized and the 
 candidates are usually older officers as well as national guard and reserve officers who can afford the time to get 
 a regular army qualification canadian officers attend the regular course which for united states officers commences in late august each 
 year for the foreign students however it starts in june when the non english speaking candidates gather for a six 
 week conversational english course in mid july all the foreign officers including the canadians report for a three week orientation 
 on procedures organizations doctrine etc during my year we also visited ist united states infantry division for two days where 
 i found that the princess pats were well known to the us infantry officers from contacts made in korea germany

 promotion 0:pro 0:motion to lieutenant colonel but is definitely one of the more important prerequisites 0:pre 0:requisites for promotion beyond 
 that rank the course is primarily an operations g 3 school forty two per cent of the syllabus is devoted

 lectures and the like the arms i e artillery engineers armour infantry and signals provided 77 of the us officers 
 on the course but i for one always felt a bit strange listening to a veterinarian or a dentist and 
 particularly a chaplain giving his orders as commanding general for a division or corps attack the majority of the officers 
 were in the rank of major or equivalent and most of them had been promoted to that rank within 6 
 to 8 months of arriving at the college and several were promoted while on the course over 90 of the 
 us students had a bachelor s degree about 40 a master s and just under 10 were studying for their 
 doctorate as attendance at the college is equated into the higher education system of the us 40 officers of the 
 course worked extra hours to produce a treatise which made them eligible for acceptance into the degree of master of 
 military science a programme not open to foreign officers not only is the officer production of the college much larger 
 than in canada or other commonwealth staff colleges but there is also a different teaching approach the course is divided 
 into four divisions of four sections each section containing 50 55 officers each section is alloted a section classroom and 
 except when the course is gathered in the main auditorium or the division in the smaller briefing room all instruction 
 takes place in this section room a section classroom usacgsc fort leavenworth kansas

 operation was to take place little time is alloted for discussion of a student solution to a problem the school 
 solution is very important as it is from them that the student officer receives the guidance as to what to 
 answer on the examinations twelve of these horrors were given throughout 0:through 0:out the course and to the us officer 
 they mean not only his survival on the course but the course of his future career after each examination he 
 is classified as either upper third middle third or lower third as grading is done on a percentile basis some 
 students must always be in the bottom third this produces intense competition among the keen types and heights of elation 
 or depths of depression when the results are issued after each examination the aspects of our staff college training i 
 missed most were the tactical exercise without troops tewts and the field trips or swans on only one occasion did 
 the regular course do an actual ground reconnaissance and the course as a group takes no field trips whatsoever as 
 allies though we were taken on many trips to see factories the levels of government etc culminating 0:cul 0:minating in 
 an eight day trip to new york city west point and washington dc this latter trip was worth all the

 movie and cartoons in the good old technique of instruction fashion i believe i learned more facts about canada in 
 the three weeks i took to prepare the talk than i ever did during my school days or while studying 
 for promotion exams anyway great interest was shown by the audience on canada and i hope we managed to convince 
 some of them we weren t snowbound twelve months a year professionally and personally my family and i enjoyed the

 bc w zolkos 3155 shelburne street victoria bc vancouver branch we started our activities in march with an executive meeting 
 to arrange for the march 17th reunion the result was we had a much better turnout than usual our president 
 col reg clark invited the executive to a dinner at the vancouver club in honour of col jim stone who 
 was the guest speaker at the reunion held at the seaforth armouries two films were shown one of world war 
 1 and one of the 2nd war the programme was enjoyed by all col stone being the main attraction everyone 
 went home happy approximately 100 attended another executive meeting was held and it was decided to try to arrange another 
 get together with the victoria branch of the association on may bth 9 quite a number of our members with 
 their wives went over the boys there gave us all the welcome which their branch is noted for col jimmy 
 edgar with the help of col jimmy carvosso were both in form and led us in the singing of the 
 ric a dam do again the vancouver branch are indebted to victoria for giving us such a good time and 
 providing us with transportation etc for june and july we enjoyed the company of george and mrs hancox the secretary 
 of our association in london england in his honour a luncheon was held where a party of 25 members and 
 wives enjoyed a visit with them later he was entertained by old patricias at their homes and clubs we also 
 were pleased to see that great war horse charlie peacock in august hank routledge and adam williams met him at 
 the airport and took him to shaughnessy hospital to have a short visit with his old buddies on his way 
 downtown adam williams hosted a dinner for him before he left he wrote to say on his return home it 
 was necessary to have his pacemaker renewed and no wonder with all the excitement we had with him charlie is 
 one of those rare cases whose heart runs on a battery 
 91 col roy stevens was our next visitor tom hank routledge our secretary was host at a luncheon party at 
 the terminal city club those attending enjoyed our visit with him he is as busy as ever and still writing 
 for christmas he mailed a few of us his booklet named a sprout of kindling size a story of his 
 early years another visitor we enjoyed meeting again was george barclay the fhard working secretary of the toronto association he 
 only had one day with us so we made the most of it brigadier jimmy de lalanne was entertaining his 
 business associates in vancouver to which a few of his old patricia friends were invited we have always admired him 
 our memories date back a long time and he can still be pictured as our baby faced corporal of 1915 
 he is still the same old jimmy as we knew him at that time reg jones from lancaster nb was 
 our last visitor for 1966 he was here earlier in the year only for one day so we missed him 
 reg was greatly interested in all our boys in the hospital so four of us joined him for a visit 
 to shaughnessy stangroom herbert jones and popey spent quite a time fighting the old battles stangroom and reg were wounded 
 by the same shell in 1917 and this was their first meeting since adam williams was host to a dinner 
 party where we were joined by jingle johnson our ages ranged from 71 to 81 we certainly enjoyed the two 
 hours we took to have dinner and we could see how much the other guests were enjoying it too some 
 of us are a little hard of hearing and many laughs were seen that night a few days later reg 
 and bill popey visited victoria a friendly visit was held with mr and mrs bill bastedo and our old comrades 
 pete pederson and sid jenning we then enjoyed a short visit with harris turner and mrs turner after we went 
 over to the veterans hospital where we found that grand old soldier rsm jack sterling and several others pete pederson 
 drove us around thanks pete we appreciate what you are doing for the patricias our executive has had a busy 
 year visiting hospitals so many of our old comrades need medical treatment on one visit there were five from the 
 old 14th platoon all 500 draft men two of whom were in wheel chairs its hard to believe that after 
 over 50 years so many of the one platoon could hold a reunion in a hospital ward four of the 
 patricias funerals have been attended by members of the executive although none were members of our association sympathy cards were 
 sent to all widows from our branch we cannot understand why so many of the men who served in our 
 fine regiment have failed to keep in touch with our association i feel even today the patricia s are a 
 big part of my life and i enjoy so many of the friends i have made during the last 50 
 years perhaps as the boys of the peacetime regiment the 2nd war and korean war will value the comradeships they 
 made during the war years and carry on where some of us will soon have to leave off the victory 
 memorial park service at the cemetary in surrey on september 18 1966 was attended by some of the executive major 
 general rockingham gave a worthwhile address and will be remembered by those attending our old comrade 51 aw lang with 
 mrs lang had the misfortune of having a car accident this summer our old friend of south africa fame walter 
 m drycott though over 80 is still going strong the last visit we had he was i up the ladder 
 painting his house 
 92 pete armishaw and bill popey attended the church service for our late comrade col colquhoun the association will miss 
 him the church was crowded by friends paying their last respects ted thomas has been in shaughnessy for a long 
 time this year and is not well enough to drive a car our president col reg clark and pete armishaw 
 attended the national association meeting in edmonton in september sid mackay and his wife helen from winnipeg visited vancouver in 
 september while they were here a small gathering of old sweats and their wives was held at the routledges the 
 gathering included bill slug demmy ralph farris earl douglas dan massie and frank bentham doug dutchy vanstone from winnipeg was 
 here for the grey cup game in case you weren t aware of it it was doug who arranged for 
 the rain to let up for the big game we in the vancouver branch become further indebted every year to 
 our very energetic and concientious bill popey bill is without a doubt the most enthusiastic patricia in these parts he 
 continues to do a superlative job of keeping tab on everyone particularly those in hospital when he was in hospital 
 himself this year the nurses could never find him he was always found visiting someone else and more important cheering 
 the others up he s a grand guy our bill honorary life members 81 p armishaw 808 regency apts 706

 elected to office president lou england vice president hank haas secretary treasurer hector munro the attached roll shows 27 members 
 in good standing for 1966 the branch has struggled along during the past six years with a membership numbered in 
 the twenties it was therefore proposed at the annual meeting to set up a planning committee for an annual reunion 
 of all patricias in the calgary area to be held on or about the 17 march 1967 this was to 
 be a centennial project designed to promote interest in the association and increase membership the following volunteer committee was approved 
 chairman doug honeyman members laurie bullard ash clifton roy cloutier carl kawanami and hector munro 
 94 the success of this project will be reported together with photographs following the annual meeting for 1967 when dues 
 for the current year will be paid we hope that owen gardner s eulogy of a patricia will be published

 year has been a fairly successful one for the branch even though our membership did not show a marked increase 
 attendance at our meetings has been somewhat spotty but we generally manage to see one or two new faces at 
 each one we are like the proverbial prairie farmer our philosophy is things will be better next year during the 
 early months of the year meetings were held in different locations with varying results now thanks to the generous hospitality 
 of the home station sergeants mess meetings are held in the tv room of the mess on the first friday 
 of every alternate month commencing with january we look forward to seeing any out of town patricias who may be 
 visiting in edmonton the main events of the year were the meeting to celebrate the birthday of our colonel in 
 chief and our attendance as individuals at the various functions connected with the trooping of the colour by 2 bn 
 and the presentation of the freedom of the city of edmonton to the regiment 
 95 prior to the departure of 2 bn for germany at a brief ceremony in the officers mess a plaque 
 was presented to the co lt col lw basham by our branch president and a small group of members the 
 plaque was a small token of thanks for the kindness and encouragement extended by the battalion to our branch as 
 a branch project we have decided to collect all possible material relating to the many regimental bands past and present 
 with a view to having a musical history of the ppcli written by a competent historian contributions such as nominal 
 rolls accounts of incidents with names etc will be greatly appreciated and acknowledged any such material should be forwarded to

 great and we won t be happy until we have lured at least eighty per cent into the fold our 
 reunions held annually in may and october were again highly successful both financially and pleasure wise the attendance at these

 our nominal roll stands at about 150 of whom 98 paid annual dues in 1966 financially the branch ended the 
 year with a small surplus the story of shorty cousins h 16736 by james m reid h 16730 apr 41 
 may 44 shortly after canada declared war on germany on september 10th 1939 shorty cousins left his job somewhere in 
 manitoba and went in to fort osborne barracks winnipeg to enlist after the usual basic training he was shipped to 
 england and on may 22nd 1940 was posted to the ppcli thereafter he participated in the frustrating series of movements 
 the exercises the mock battles the excursions and alarms which for three years were the lot of the canadians in 
 the british isles and at dawn on july 10th 1943 shorty waded ashore on the beaches of sicily as a 
 buck private in a company ppcli there was nothing outstanding about shorty except perhaps his height for he got his 
 nickname because of his lack of stature and not like his first commanding 0:com 0:manding officer because he towered over 
 everything in sight he was a quiet man who performed the tasks allotted to him with intelligence and efficiency kept 
 out of serious trouble and if he had any qualities of leadership he kept them hidden from the superiors off 
 parade he was a pleasant companion not given to excesses and in the barracks the pubs and the occasional social 
 meetings shorty was just a good guy you were glad to have along for nearly two weeks after the initial 
 landings the patricia s pushed steadily northwestward now in the van now in support there were daily and hourly skirmishes 
 but the italians were sick of war and usually after mere token resistance were glad to surrender the real enemy 
 was the terrific heat and the ever present pall of dust the smells and the poverty of the land and 
 the 
 102 people it was not until the brigade turned eastward toward cattania that the germans were encountered and the real 
 trouble began the first objective was leonforte and the commanding heights beyond the town and the edmontons were selected for 
 the attack they stormed across the river and into the town and then contact was lost only the sound of 
 rifle machine gun and artillery fire gave evidence that they were still fighting this was the afternoon of july 21st 
 and as soon as the edmontons had crossed the river the engineers moved to rebuild the bridge which would permit 
 the tanks and anti tank guns to join in the fight early in the morning of the 22nd the bridge 
 was finished but it was still under heavy fire and the patricia s c company made a wild dash over 
 with the tanks and the guns and thanks to their speed made good the approaches to the town they were 
 followed by a and b companies and while fighting was still going on in the town the patricia s were 
 ordered to clear the heights beyond the tanks were held up in the narrow streets so the infantry had to 
 go it alone it was in this attack on the heights beyond leonforte that gave the junior officers and men 
 of the patricia s their first real opportunity to show the initiative courage and refusal to be stopped that marked 
 the canadian fighting man and was demonstrated so often in both world wars i and 11 leonforte followed the pattern 
 set by the patricia s in all the great battles of world war i and set the pattern which would 
 be followed in sicily italy the netherlands and later in korea three outstanding examples are noted in the regimental history 
 lieut rex carey with 8 platoon worked his way forward through dead ground and closed on a series of machine 
 gun nests with bomb and bayonet in a quick deadly encounter pte wilfred reilly stalked a machine gun post from 
 the ruins of a house and put paid to its crew for the third the exploit of pte shorty cousins 
 a more complete story is found in canadians in italy the official history among the many deeds of bravery performed 
 that day in and about the hard won town of leonforte none were more spectacular than that of private js 
 cousins a member of a company of the patricia s during the fighting on the heights to the west of 
 leonforte the two leading platoons were halted by the intensity of fire coming from two enemy machine gun posts on 
 the objective while they were reorganizing cousins accompanied by an nco on his own initiative advanced against the german positions 
 one hundred and fifty yards from the crest cousins companion fell under the hail of bullets which swept the slope 
 despite the fact that further progress appeared to be utter suicide to the men of his company who were watching 
 this gallant soldier he then with complete disregard for his own life rose to his feet in full view of 
 the enemy and carrying his bren gun boldly charged the enemy posts this resolute action so demoralized the enemy that 
 he was able to close within less than fifty yards of their positions then firing from the hip he killed 
 or wounded the german machine gunners silencing both posts a company took and successfully held the ridge but unfoirtunately private 
 cousins was killed later on in the afternoon by a direct hit he was subsequently mentioned in dispatches note neither 
 the distinguished conduct medal nor the military medal can be awarded posthumously shorty will long be remembered by those who 
 knew him and what he did on the hills beyond leonforte deserves more than the few lines devoted to him

 dunphy and stu ennis smith because of ill health during the year art mcgory requested that he be releived of 
 his office and jim stone agreed to carry on as acting president until our annual meeting in the spring of 
 1967 during the past few years we have been very fortunate with respect to accommodation thanks to the kindness of 
 the commanding officer of no 9 transport company rcasc as a result our executive meetings and smokers are always held 
 in hospitable surroundings many patricias have been posted away from ottawa during the last year and to them go our 
 best wishes and a quick return at the same time postings have brought new faces to ottawa and we welcome 
 all to our branch as a centennial project bill dawson and ted mackay are engaged in compiling a scrap book 
 of the activities and history of the ottawa branch this beautifully bound book will be a prized possession of the 
 branch in the years to come during 1966 our paid up membership dropped to 57 with some 130 names on 
 the roll it is the intention of the executive to increase interest in the association during 1967 despite inclement weather 
 some 30 members made their way through rain and fog to the fall smoker on december 7 jim stone spoke 
 briefly and assured them they were going to have an interesting evening the smoker committee bill sterling and stu ennis 
 smith arranged with the public relations officer of the centennial military tatto for a sneak preview in the form of 
 an illustrated address with sound effects all present agreed the tattoo was a must for all canadians to attend the

 107 montreal branch for reasons which we needn t explain two years have passed since the montreal branch reported to 
 the patrician but despite the silence we have individually and collectively been busy with the affairs of the association and 
 the maintenance erf regimental spirit we ve divided our time between formal meetings if 0:meet 0:ings 0:if any of our 
 meetings can be called formal and the equally enjoyable personal contacts with old comrades which stem from the fact that 
 montreal is a port of call for so many patricias we still have over 80 members on our nominal roll 
 and an encouraging number turn out for our gatherings which are always held in the officers mess at mcgill whose 
 campus holds memories for so many patricias here the university companies mustered in world war i and a beautiful tablet 
 presented by the late mr justice gregor barclay commemorates the fact that over 1 200 men who trained on this 
 spot went forward to the regiment in the field world war ii again saw men from or connected with mcgill 
 wearing our badges and of course the university s third campus area bears the name of our founder who bequeathed 
 it the university stadium is named after captain percival molson and the names of major talbot papineau and many other 
 members of the regiment are honoured in various ways over the past twenty months we have held five meetings all 
 in the same form a buffet dinner a short business meeting and then some entertainment the entertainment item has ranged 
 from old movies of the regiment in the godstone area with denis jotcham starring as a nautch girl to glen 
 bannerman giving us the latest report on expo where he is one of the principal planners to a fascinating 0:fascin 
 0:ating slide show on the normandy battlefields by carleton s royce an amateur historian at other times we have had 
 outstanding war films from the national film board one of the best features of our meetings has been the presence 
 of serving members of the regiment who are stationed at mobile command here in montreal they have included colonel george 
 brown major al wagstaffe captains dick macintosh and art neadow other visitors have been the colonel of the regiment bucko 
 watson bunchy newlands the late beloved willie mulherin colonel norman mitchell vc and mr frank jarvis who for sixty years 
 served hammie gault as a devoted man of business and who has watched over the regiment from the earliest days 
 our members continue to play their part in community affairs none more so than jimmy de lalanne who in addition 
 to being involved in almost everything worthwhile here in montreal represented the dominion president of the legion at the recent 
 ceremonies at vimy at our last meeting on march 17th he was presented with regimental souvenirs as a token of 
 appreciation for his magnificent work on behalf of the association and the regiment the historian of the regiment roy stevens 
 is forever preoccupied with some new work and as many know other regiments including the loyal edmonton regiment and the 
 royal canadian regiment have retained him to commemorate their exploits as usual the sad fact is that some of our 
 comrades have answered the over the past twenty months we have held five meetings all in the same form a

 131 the princess patricia s first entry into the trenches en flanders january 4th 1915 walter mackay draycot the princess 
 patricia s canadian light infantry regiment had marched from the slippery slushy mud camp at winchester to southampton england on 
 the morning of 21 december 1914 with everyone in high spirits on entering the crowded streets of southampton we were 
 met by cheerful citizens who wished us well their greeting and good wishes were returned with that popular song of 
 the day hail hail the gang s all here while mugs of hot tea and comestibles were passed around at 
 dusk we boarded the s s cardiganshire and availed ourselves of what comfort there was on the upper deck to 
 dodge rain and cold wind on the english channel no sleeping accommodation provided arriving at la havre next morning tired 
 stiff sleepy and feeling very dirty we travelled a cobbled stone road leading to a field on a hillside the 
 night being cold a blanket was issued to each man to envelope the clothes he wore and was yet to 
 wear for several days without removal for a bath or change of underwear vivas for canada were many as the 
 maidens kissed and the youngsters cut buttons from our tunics crying souvenir messieur souvenir when passing through the town for 
 a small fee one of the boys sang the marseillaise 0:mar 0:seillaise for us that night under canvas was miserable 
 with rain and cold on the morning of the 23rd the men were packed like sardines into a french boxcar 
 the novelty was brief when nature called it was obeyed by slightly opening 0:open 0:ing the door when the train 
 passed through country of course the cramped railway journey ended at aire where we detrained in darkness for twas midnight 
 along cobbled roads to the village of blaringhem for over an hour the men waited to be detailed off to 
 a billet two lucky companies were billeted in the village but number two company was assigned a farm with barns 
 and other outbuildings the officers enjoying more elite habitations elsewhere our stay here was much occupied with the usual guard 
 duty picquets and work parties although the front line of war was 25 miles away rifles were always carried with 
 ten rounds of ammunition no matter where you went when in the act of digging trenches in a farmer s 
 field our equipment comprising full marching order with a complete stock of ammunition was placed on the parados side of 
 the trench together with stacked rifles and bayonets affixed thereto rain or sunshine mostly absent the unnecessary drudgery continued the 
 men returned from this task soaked almost to the skin their packs and ankle length woollen overcoats heavily weighted with 
 rain water and greasy mud and with the addition of rifle and ammunition hung heavily on their shoulders the sight 
 of their billet such as it was gave hope for a bowl of hot stew from the cook and a 
 possible letter or parcel from the postman the belgian farmhouse had a quadrangle of outbuildings adjoining it in the centre 
 of the square a large pit contained refuse from all the buildings including the house there were the pigsty poultry 
 pens horse stables cowbarns 0:cow 0:barns and general garbage in these buildings the men found some sort of a billet 
 two of us slept in the capacious oven away from the house after the farmer had withdrawn the baked bread 
 the farmer objected so we were expelled becoming homeless we bunked in a farm wagon during nights the farmer used 
 it in daytime for hauling manure it was returned wet smelly and muddy swiped 
 132 hay made it smell sweeter the prolonged wet cold nights forced us to change our bedroom and four of 
 us spread blankets over a manure pile the warmest bed i had throughout the whole war the fresh horse manure 
 below us and a nippy night frost around us who cared a wartime luxury christmas day 1914 was wet cloudy 
 and decidely uncomfortable for the great festival we had no choice but to accept bully beef in place of turkey 
 or roast beef we were told a boxcar containing christmas fare and gifts had gone astray probably sidetracked but could 
 not be located a country at war can conveniently lose many things the mythical boxcar and its contents was and 
 still is a mystery though we still maintain freedom of thought luckily a few of us had friends among the 
 imperial 80th brigade 27th division under general snow who were quartered locally being warmly welcomed we were invited to spend 
 christmas with them at the officers mess with hereward the wake a direct descendant of the famous hereward the wake 
 and other officers it seemed strange that their boxcar was not side tracked a commission in the king s royal 
 rifle corps was proffered but i reluctantly refused some times a man does not know what road to choose at 
 long last the expected order was announced get ready to move up to the front line that was welcome news 
 the trenches could not be worse than conditions here so we thought in any case there would be action the 
 men were paid a few francs to buy necessaries for use in the trenches very few understood 0:under 0:stood the 
 french language or even pigeon french some mistook the french word estaminet for epicerie saloon and grocery respectively arriving back 
 from the village at dusk the ones who had imbibed firewater were eager to comply to a suggestion from one 
 of their vociferous buddies to hold a camp fire in typical backwoods style reason had taken flight eagerly and maliciously 
 they sought anything combustible the leader stood on a box and invited the audience to form a circle around the 
 fire he opened the meeting thus gentlemen genelmen i have the honour of calling on our esteemed brother and comradein 
 arms 0:comrade 0:in 0:arms private underwood for a song or if the blighter can t sing then a recitation 0:reci 
 0:tation the victim obliged had to during the height of this revelry when men take leave of their senses unbeknown 
 to themselves the farmer had sent for the officers whom remonstrating were cordially if not defiantly invited to join in 
 also the farmer a few reassuring words from a liaison officer satisfied the farmer for the propounders of the group 
 party were dangerously happy and not to be trifled with true the farmer had lost all his coal wood for 
 baking most of his doors and other combustible material but of course the liaison officer informed him he would be 
 reimbursed there is always a morning after the night before the revelry had continued 0:con 0:tinued up to 5 a 
 m and as the march to the trenches commenced at 7 a m there had been no time for rest 
 especially for those who had imbibed much wine the roll call showed none absent they had not forgotten their loyalty 
 facing us for the days toil was an agonizing march of 15 miles a lack of shoe repairers caused pain 
 penance to many also lack of ordinary sized shoes which forced a few to walk the distance with the big 
 toe protruding if you have to do penance never do it on a cobblestone road with a pair of old 
 shoes exposing the toes on the journey citizens were asked how far it was to a certain village the answers 
 varied just up the road and not far meaning three miles or more however we finally arrived at a billet 
 which in truth was a large barn and a few pig pens and the usual manure pile the aroma at 
 night reminded one away back 
 133 when here we expected to rest at least a day but no on the march again at 10 a 
 m my boots were badly in need of repair or a new pair the only answer to my application was 
 all we have are size ll s my size was 8 which like my stetson hat was my own property 
 on joining the ppcli at winchester they did not have a hat to fit me so 1 was allowed to 
 retain my stetson the army boots were composed of sponge foam like leather in common parlance belly leather the cobble 
 stones were still with us up to the time when we entered a field near dickebusch there to wait in 
 the cold until dusk set in the menu during the resting period consisted of that army special bully beef and 
 attendant 0:atten 0:dant biscuits having lost the toss for milk and sugar the cook served the tea neat ugh worse 
 still it was insultingly warm cloudy sky blackened as dusk approached drizzle took charge of the elements over there it 
 does not take long for a grassy field to be transformed into a sludge mass lining up for parade a 
 close check was made of accoutrements emergency rations and ammunition an order was given put out all pipes and cigarettes 
 the firing line was three miles away a pipe can be camouflaged but not a cigarette yes the smokers cursed 
 but precaution had to be taken back again onto those cursed cobble stones and entered the village of dickebusch in 
 darkness how did those villagers know we were coming they were waiting with a truly welcome greeting vive iangleterre sauveteurs 
 de belgique they apparently not knowing we represented canada one generous civilian with a human trend brought a bucket of 
 coffee with an elixer of life therein rum a godsend not a drop went into the men s waterbottles but 
 each was served a tot to drink a drizzling rain with cold wind added to the gloom and discomfort that 
 had been our lot during the past fortnight like ghostly spectres the men glided round the corner of the road 
 at dickebusch that led toward groote vierstraat great crossroad this short stretch of road was pitted with rain filled shellholes 
 0:shell 0:holes and the terrain where paving had been displaced was slippery with affectionate belgian mud solemnly simulating a funeral 
 procession in dread silence except when a man slipped into a shell hole we slowly proceeded enemy star shells gave 
 some assistance by illuminating the shell holes while their bullets droned overhead of rubber sheets there were none some outfitter 
 slipped there being soaked with rain mattered not if one fell into a shell hole the weight bearing on one 
 s shoulders was becoming painful for there had been no relief from it all day and the previous day a 
 pack mule does have its weight lifted after a while by comparison mans supposed domination over the lower animals does 
 not fit halting in the hamlet of groote vierstraat the following orders were given we will enter the trench area 
 by a field gate on the left of the road a few hundreds of yards down there must be no 
 talking whispering or rattle of accoutrements for the enemy have two machine guns trained on the gate when star shells 
 go up everyone must lie flat irrespective of where he is only through the aid of star shells we discerned 
 and finally reached the gateway of death for two dead frenchmen lay to one side of it the night was 
 pitch black have you ever tried to paddle through 18 to 24 inches of mud that lies on a greasy 
 bed and by way of being a tightrope walker carry a soldier s kit with a rainsoaked 0:rain 0:soaked overcoat 
 rifle ammunition and other have you held your breath after bumping your head or other in polite society well our 
 predicament was similar naturally several of the boys wallowed full length in this slimy clay mud entrance to a field 
 this field was pockmarked with shell holes that made it necessary in some places to crawl there were hastily dug 
 trenches and the inescapable 
 134 barbed wire to be seen only when a friendly star shell illuminated the scene the enemy appeared to have 
 the jitters more than we had or were we on an equal footing whatever the comparison it was most unpleasant 
 to have to prostrate oneself on a soaking wet field and feel the chill as our hands contacted the cold 
 wet sod slowly and painfully we rise to go a few more steps before the action is again repeated our 
 friends across the way had not noticed us too many dead around possibly we had about 200 yards to go 
 no one had informed us of the topography of this area but a slow moving stream bek beck or brook 
 indicated 0:indi 0:cated we were in a valley with the enemy occupying the south bank or ridge with our trenches 
 just below his which situation maintained throughout the war he was always on top with intensive darkness prevailing there was 
 difficulty in finding a crossing 0:cross 0:ing over the reserve trench a narrow plank was found but its breadth frustrated 
 a few men who toppled into the icy cold water completely armoured with full accoutrements their plight can only be 
 surmised one would need to experience the feat to obtain realism others tried to jump across but jumping onto a 
 raised clayey bank is unwise you win the jump but sloop your boots have no claws and down you go 
 into the water logged trench a few souls went naughty and so would yours bad as these conditions were the 
 worst was yet to come in front of the trench was the ever present barbed wire wire cutters had not 
 yet been issued it was with difficulty the men got through though not without leaving some of their clothing suspended 
 on the wires two dead frenchmen hung on the wire their presence caused a third of my company to be 
 separated from the main body as they were mistaken for live men trying to get through the barrier it fell 
 to me to sally forth into the unknown to seek information respecting the whereabouts of les soldat anglaise from the 
 french soldiers being relieved two were contacted and willingly gave directions in the early days of the first great war 
 there were no communication trenches hence the difficulty in locating any particular regiment members of my party were placed that 
 night in their respective sections on approaching the section allotted to us we stumbled over many dead bodies lying in 
 a very shallow grave in rear of the trench was the corpse of a french soldier by no means an 
 encouragement to us my fighting partner and self desiring to obtain the depth of the trench in the darkness it 
 occurred to me to sit on the edge and caustiously try one foot that being unsatisfactory i jumped in with 
 both feet right onto the body of a dead man ugh that furnished a double chill the water and the 
 dead man when in billets at blaringhem the men were told the trenches were dry and had dugouts with coal 
 braziers just propaganda from the brass hats we found them four feet deep surmounted by a parapet of clay three 
 feet high total seven feet wooden loopholes were affixed in the parapet clay to look and fire through they did 
 not command a wide field of view muddy clay water filled the trench up to our middle and worse when 
 the enemy on top of the ridge pumped filth out of his own trench to course downhill into our trench 
 as for dugouts there was only one and that was occupied by the officer in charge of the company major 
 mclnnery who spent an hour or so in it as soon as we were established at our posts the question 
 of ration duty arose it fell to my lot to attend to the section everyone suddenly feeling under the weather 
 the thought of it to again walk crawl creep and flop over that terrain of uncertainty napoleon was right an 
 army moves on its stomach moving 0:mov 0:ing off in pairs we defied orders concerning star shells having by now 
 become absolutely indifferent to the meaning of life machine and rifle bullets whizzed 
 135 by the enemy sorely needed rifle target practice four men out of eight reached the crossroad in groote vierstraat 
 the rations consisted of 80 one pound cans of bully beef and two sacks of bread which being rain soaked 
 were left for the rats my comrade and self agreed to carry 40 cans of bully beef in relays of 
 100 yards but owing to weakness from loss of sleep exposure to the elements and lack of decent food he 
 could not uphold his part whereupon it devolved upon me to carry the load strange it was the cans were 
 not in a sack but neatly piled pyramid shape in the middle of the road using my comrade s civilian 
 waterproof cape which had been sent to him by a relative the cans were wrapped in it all went well 
 until the muddy gateway was reached a ripping sound of cloth parting occurred while i slithered in the mudhole to 
 maintain balance no use the whole lot of cans tumbled into the mud by groping about twenty cans were retrieved 
 these we stuffed into our pockets and haversack but having to contend with obstacles en route to the trench the 
 total count delivered was ten on hearing our report none of the men cared to risk life or limb to 
 obtain a can or two at the gate dawn broke with a broody sky of sombre clouds we were now 
 able to gaze on our abode of discontent and misery what a sight where was all that honour and glory 
 of war how the male species of the human family could live under such appalling conditions would baffle the keenest 
 student to the right and left of us men in the agonies of rheumatism trench feet and sickness of other 
 sorts not to be wondered at considering what they had undergone during three days and nights a march of thirty 
 miles in two days and on the night of the second day to be placed in this filthy water logged 
 stinky muddy rat infested and germ finfested trench with none to attend to their afflictions and none to take them 
 to a medical man the only communication with the rear headquarters was by messenger at night the sick and wounded 
 had to remain in the trench until nightfall no matter if he had received his wound at 5 or 6 
 a m we were weak not wholly from hunger but from exposure to the frigid elements lack of sleep and 
 regular food and drink merciless rain had soaked us through and through and the only antidote was to keep moving 
 something the fellows failed to do at night on the parado back of trench or at least keep the feet 
 and hands active to maintain body temperature mud was everywhere and almost all rifles were clogged with it to render 
 them useless my fighting partner a military phrase at that time had lost his in the mud last night when 
 the parapet of mud and filth gave way and pinioned him it had been his turn to keep watch while 
 i sat on the back of the trench to get relief from the water and try to snooze with overcoat 
 collar turned up and both hands crossed over into opposite sleeves a la oriental it proved lucky for me that 
 he cried for help for he unknowingly saved my life my sleep was the sweet sleep of death having fallen 
 into a state of coma my dream was of kith and kin all my relatives were seated around a spacious 
 table in the dining room and on the table were all those things one expects at christmas the feeling being 
 so natural was the acme of comfort it was so realistic that even the warmth of a fire could be 
 felt but came the rude awakening the yell from my almost entombed fighting partner now rendered hors de combat calling 
 for help he was afterwards killed at battle of vimy ridge it was a black impenetrable night my senses returned 
 slowly then came the shock of realization over my predicament and his on making a move the water around my 
 legs made itself felt so did a trickle of rain down my back 
 136 there being no spade at hand despite his yelling for one it was necessary to use ones hands to 
 throw the mud clay back to where it had slipped from the parapet had this happened in daylight we would 
 have been two sitting ducks for the enemy being a watchmaker by trade the act of using his hands instead 
 of a spade was a reluctant ordeal for my friend after working for many hours we succeeded in throwing back 
 most of the clay but in our eagerness the wood loophole 0:wood 0:loop 0:hole had been covered that robbed us 
 of our only viewpoint and as dawn was breaking the enemy would be on the watch it had to be 
 cleared and quickly too that meant climbing on the parapet in full view of their snipers pleaded my partner don 
 t do it you ll be killed firing bullets through the clogged loophole 0:loop 0:hole left no opening so by 
 mounting the parapet and rapidly clawing the clay away the loophole was cleared but the germans ever on the alert 
 had spotted me and two bullets narrowly missed my right leg that marksman was more of a friend than an 
 enemy his shots were merely a warning my f p had retrieved his rifle after giving it a water bath 
 it was outwardly presentable though not workable 0:work 0:able until oiled from my reserve oil bottle just to let our 
 friends across the way realize there was animation in our trench private roch killed later and i kept up a 
 fairly steady fire all day ours were the only rifles working because to the right and left of us in 
 this section of the trench the men were inactive through some sort of sickness and their rifles were clogged with 
 mud the elusive sun took an inquisitive glance at us then receded to order more rain somewhere at the rear 
 of our trenches a french 75mm gun playing solo was the only security of that type we heard by way 
 of reply at about 10 a m the enemy introduced his might by sending over a newfangled 0:new 0:fangled 12 
 inch bore shell which as the main shell passed over us would explode shrapnel lead bullets then pass on to 
 a second line of defence trenches which were empty to burst there the main shell continued a course to explode 
 by concussion the cannonading continued all day the only nice feature about their shells was the beautiful colours they emitted 
 upon bursting fortunate it was for us that the enemy did not shell us at night the only opportunity we 
 had to leave the trench to obey the law of nature at the back of our trench was a dead 
 frenchman his serviceable greatcoat 0:great 0:coat was retrieved and made use of obtaining two wooden stakes and pushing them through 
 the sleeves a cover was made against rain and wind while we rested in the water logged trench had the 
 opposition forces known of our pitiful plight they could have walked downhill to us and taken over their gunners had 
 sighted over us at first but later got closer to do the job methodically as is their wont shells dropped 
 rather close to the rear of us splashing our backs and a couple of the sick men shrieked when clods 
 struck them not a thing could be done to assist them two direct hits on the trench to the right 
 more agony and misery to be borne by the wounded who had to rely on their comrades to bandage the 
 wounds without 0:with 0:out any communication trench none could leave the front line or come to it during daylight the 
 situation became more wretched by additional groans and yells of the increasing number of sick men helplessly squatting in water 
 and clay growing dusk made a weird scene no first aid except what you carried on you the previous night 
 we did have a spot of rum but its effect was but temporary rats appeared as night approached it became 
 common to have one s vision obscured momentarily at dusk when a rat crossed in front of your face the 
 task of relief work was by no means light as those performing it had to bring out the sick wounded 
 and dead relief men too had to risk their 
 137 lives while crossing that sloppy greasy field barbed wire shell holes and other obstacles to become a member of 
 the princess patricia s canadian light infantry one had to declare having seen active service or military training but my 
 contact with some of the younger members elicited the fact they sneaked in after the manner of if you have 
 a friend use him a friend at court i e aside from this none of us had undergone the rigours 
 of trench warfare but what we had endured since leaving winchester southampton and the trek to the trenches would tend 
 to break any man s stamina and none turned back here is the origin of birth of men comprising the
